SUMMARY&#13;
While the literature on social accounting matrices, (SAMs) has been&#13;
growing apace, details of the issues which arise in constructing a SAM are&#13;
not always documented. It is therefore thought worthwhile, to make&#13;
generally available the SAM for Malaysia which is described in this study,&#13;
since it addresses a number of conceptual issues and their practical&#13;
solution which have not been treated elsewhere as far as we know. In this&#13;
sense the present study is a sequel to earlier work on Sri Lanka, (Pyatt,&#13;
Roe, et. al. (1977)) but with greater emphasis on the statistical problems of&#13;
constructing a SAM and less on the application of results. It assumes some&#13;
familiarity with the subject, such as might be obtained from King (1981),&#13;
Bank Staff Working Paper #463.&#13;
The SAM described in this paper is a large one, with a level of detail&#13;
more nearly that at which national accounts are typically compiled, rather&#13;
than the more aggregated formats which are often adopted as a basis for&#13;
macro models or analysis. Indeed, one reason for undertaking this study was&#13;
to explore the implications of working at different levels, starting with a&#13;
higher level of disaggregation than that ultimately sustained.&#13;
Malaysia was chosen for this study because of the strength of the pri-&#13;
mary materials available. These include an excellent set of national accounts&#13;
based on the commodity balance approach. These made possible an initial ex-&#13;
ploration of the strengths and weaknesses of using market prices as the basis&#13;
for evaluation of commodity balances, leading to some formal, algebraic&#13;
treatment of the reasons for preferring this approach to other conventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
An extensive household survey, covering incomes, expenditures and employ-&#13;
ment issues complements the national accounts in defining the principle data&#13;
sources. It makes possible the treatment of household income and outlay out-&#13;
counts in some detail, and raises a number of issues which the text attempts&#13;
to address, concerning the reconciliation of national accounts and household&#13;
survey data, not least with regard to savings.&#13;
Unfortunately, the scope of these primary data sources is largely&#13;
restricted to the Peninsular or West Malaysian states, while the whole of&#13;
Malaysia, including the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, is the&#13;
subject of this study. Efforts to meet this wider definition introduce some&#13;
further novelty. In the first place, it has been necessary to define a two-&#13;
region SAM at the conceptual level. It turns out that, while there is nothing&#13;
special about having two regions rather than several - the issues hinge on&#13;
having any number greater than one - there are some important questions to be&#13;
resolved at this stage. Next, given the conceptual framework, the approach&#13;
is essentially to estimate a SAM for East Malaysia and then to form the SAM&#13;
for all Malaysia by combining this with a matched matrix for the West Malaysia&#13;
states. Given the sparcity of data, estimating the SAM for East Malaysia calls&#13;
for an imaginative approach along lines similar to those which have previously&#13;
been adopted in the regional input-output literature.&#13;
These are the major novelties to be discussed in this paper, and they&#13;
should be of interest to others concerned with SAM estimation methods, They&#13;
lead initially to a very large matrix, which is then reduced in size to yield&#13;
a final version in which details are determined on the basis of interest and&#13;
accuracy.&#13;

RESUME&#13;
S'il existe aujourd'hui d'assez nombreux ouvrages sur les matrices de&#13;
comptabilite sociale (MCS), peu d'entre eux traitent dans le detail les&#13;
questions qui se posent lors de leur construction. Il serait donc utile,&#13;
a notre avis, de diffuser largement la MCS pour la Malaisie decrite dans&#13;
cette etude qui, nous semble-t-il, analyse pour la premiere fois un cer-&#13;
tain nombre de problemes theoriques et propose des solutions pratiques.&#13;
En ce sens, le pr6sent document est la suite du travail deja effectue sur&#13;
Sri Lanka, (MM. Pyatt, Roe, et divers collaborateurs (1977)) mais fait une&#13;
plus grande place aux problemes statistiques pos6s par la construction&#13;
d'une MCS qu'a l'application des resultats. Sa comprehension suppose une&#13;
certaine connaissance du sujet, que l'on peut acquerir en se r6ferant au&#13;
document de travail de la Banque No 463 de M. King (1981).&#13;
La MCS decrite dans ce document comporte un tres grand nombre de&#13;
lignes et de colonnes et contient des details que l'on trouve generalement&#13;
dans les comptes nationaux plutot que dans les bases de donnees plus con-&#13;
cises, utilis6es le plus souvent pour les modeles ou analyses macroecono-&#13;
miques. En fait, l'un des buts meme de l1'tude etait de comparer les&#13;
merites de plusieurs methodes de travail, en commencant par un niveau de&#13;
d6sagregation plus pousse que celui retenu en fin de compte.&#13;
On a choisi la Malaisie pour mener cette etude a cause de l'impor-&#13;
tance des donnees primaires disponibles qui comprennent notamment un&#13;
ensemble de comptes nationaux tres fiables etablis a partir de la methode&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vi -&#13;
de l"'equilibre emplois-ressources". Ces donnees ont permis un premier&#13;
examen des avantages et des inconv6nients de l'emploi des prix du marche&#13;
comme base d'evaluation de l'equilibre emplois-ressources et d'exposer,&#13;
sous forme theorique et alg6brique les raisons de preferer cette methode&#13;
a d'autres conventions.&#13;
Une grande enquete sur les menages, portant sur les revenus, les&#13;
d6penses et l'emploi, constitue, avec les comptes nationaux, la principale&#13;
source de donn6es. Elle fournit des renseignements detaill6s sur les&#13;
revenus et les d6penses des menages et souleve un certain nombre de ques-&#13;
tions, auxquelles les auteurs de ce document s'efforcent d'apporter une&#13;
r6ponse, au sujet de l'harmonisation des comptes nationaux et des chiffres&#13;
tires de l'enquete sur les menages, en particulier en ce qui concerne&#13;
l'epargne.&#13;
Malheureusement, ces donnees primairea, n'existent pour la plupart que&#13;
pour la Malaisie peninsulaire ou Malaisie occidentale alors que c'est&#13;
l'ensemble du pays y compris les etats de la Malaisie orientale, (Sabah et&#13;
Sarawak) qui fait l'objet de l'4tude. I1 a donc fallu innover. En pre-&#13;
mier lieu, on a ete amene a definir ce que devait etre, sur le plan theo-&#13;
rique, une MCS pour deux regions. En r6alit6, l'inclusion de plus de deux&#13;
regions n'ajouterait rien au probl&amp;me, qui reside dans le fait d'en etu-&#13;
dier plus d'une, et certaines questions importantes doivent etre r6solues&#13;
A ce stade. Une fois le cadre th6orique choisi, la methode consiste&#13;
essentiellement A proceder A des estimations afin d'etablir une MCS pour&#13;
la Malaisie orientale puis a construire une MCS pour l'ensemble du pays en&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vii -&#13;
combinant la premiere matrice avec une matrice concordante pour les Etats&#13;
de Malaisie occidentale. Compte tenu du manque de donnees, il faut, pour&#13;
proc6der aux estimations concernant la Malaisie orientale, adopter la meme&#13;
approche imaginative que pour l1etablissement de tableaux regionaux des&#13;
entrees-sorties.&#13;
Telles sont les principales innovations dont il est question dans ce&#13;
document; elles devraient interesser les personnes travaillant sur des&#13;
methodes d'estimation en vue de l'etablissement de MCS. Elles menent au&#13;
depart a la construction d'une matrice tres detaillee qui est ensuite&#13;
reduite et dont la dimension definitive est determinee par le degr6 de&#13;
desagregation qu'on souhaite et peut atteindre.&#13;

Extracto&#13;
Si bien la bibliografia sobre las matrices de contabilidad social (MCS) ha&#13;
aumentado de prisa, no siempre se documentan los detalles de los problemas que&#13;
se plantean cuando se construye una MCS. Por lo tanto, se considera conveniente&#13;
divulgar la preparada para Malasia que se describe en este estudio, puesto que&#13;
encara una serie de cuestiones de concepto, asi como su soluci6n practica, que&#13;
de acuerdo con nuestra informaci6n no han sido tratadas hasta la fecha. En este&#13;
sentido, este estudio es un corolario de otro anterior sobre Sri Lanka (Pyatt,&#13;
Roe y col.(1977)), pero con mas hincapie en los problemas estadisticos que&#13;
intervienen en la preparaci6n de una MCS y menos en la aplicaci6n de los&#13;
resultados. Supone cierto conocimiento del tema, por ejemplo, la lectura del&#13;
documento de trabajo del personal del Banco Mundial No.463, preparado por King&#13;
(1981).&#13;
La MCS que se describe en este informe es grande, con un nivel de detalle&#13;
mas semejante al que se utiliza tipicamente para compilar las cuentas nacionales&#13;
que a los formatos mas globales que se adoptan con frecuencia como base para los&#13;
modelos o analisis macroecon6micos. De hecho, una de las razones para abordar&#13;
este estudio fue poder explorar los efectos que tiene trabajar en distintos&#13;
niveles, comenzando con un nivel mayor de desglose del que se utiliza por uiltimo.&#13;
Se eligi6 Malasia para este estudio debido a la solidez de los elementos&#13;
primarios disponibles, entre ellos, excelentes cuentas nacionales basadas en el&#13;
enfoque de la balanza de bienes. Permitieron una primera exploraci6n de los&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ix -&#13;
puntos fuertes y debiles de la utilizaci6n de los precios de mercado como base&#13;
para la evaluaci6n de las balanzas de bienes, lo que llev6 a un tratamiento&#13;
algebraico formal de las razones para preferir este enfoque a otros&#13;
convencionales.&#13;
Una encuesta amplia de las unidades familiares, que abarca ingresos, gastos&#13;
y empleo, se utiliza como complemento de las cuentas nacionales para definir las&#13;
fuentes primarias de datos. Permite tratar el ingreso de la unidad familiar y&#13;
las cuentas de gastos con cierto detalle, y plantea una serie de problemas&#13;
relativos a la reconciliaci6n de los datos de las cuentas nacionales y de la&#13;
encuesta familiar, y tambien con respecto a los ahorros, que este estudio trata&#13;
de abordar.&#13;
Lamentablemente, el alcance de estas fuentes primarias de datos se limita&#13;
en gran medida a los estados de la peninsula o de Malasia Occidental, en tanto&#13;
que este estudio abarca la totalidad del pais, incluidos los estados de Sabah y&#13;
Sarawak. Al tratar de aplicar esta definici6n mas amplia, se introducen algunos&#13;
otros aspectos nuevos. En primer lugar, ha sido necesario definir en el nivel&#13;
conceptual una MCS de dos regiones. Ocurre que, si bien no hay nada especial en&#13;
tener dos regiones en lugar de varias --todo depende de tener un numero&#13;
cualquiera mayor que uno-- hay ciertas cuestiones importantes que deben&#13;
resolverse en esta etapa. Luego, dado el marco conceptual, el metodo es&#13;
esencialmente estimar una MCS para Malasia Oriental y luego formar la que&#13;
corresponde a todo el pais, combinando la primera con una matriz adecuada a los&#13;
estados de Malasia Occidental. Dado que se dispone de pocos datos, la&#13;
estimaci6n de la MCS de Malasia Oriental requiere un metodo imaginativo que siga&#13;
lineamientos similares a los que se han adoptado anteriormente en la&#13;
bibliografia sobre el insumo-producto de la regi6n.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estas son las novedades principales que se examinan en este informe y sin&#13;
duda seran de interes para los que se dedican a los m6todos de estimaci6n de&#13;
MCS. Inicialmente, llevan a una matriz nwuy grande, que luego se reduce en&#13;
tamaiio para tener una versi6n final en la que se determinan los detalles de&#13;
acuerdo al interes y a la precision.&#13;

Preface&#13;
This study was completed in 1978, and for that reason, and because&#13;
its subject matter is the Malaysian economy in 1970, the material presented is&#13;
now somewhat dated. This notwithstanding, we have received a steady stream of&#13;
requests for documentation of this social accounting study of Malaysia. This&#13;
may be because it remains the latest (and perhaps the last), in a series of&#13;
exercises which have taken us personally from Iran to Sri Lanka; to Swaziland;&#13;
and hence to Malaysia, with the results reported here. Increasingly, others&#13;
have been undertaking similar exercises in a wide variety of countries,&#13;
motivated perhaps by the relevance of social accounting matrices (SAMs) not&#13;
only for the collation and synthesis of data but also as a basis for&#13;
macroeconomic analysis, planning and modeling. In pioneering new&#13;
developments, it is always useful to be able to refer to the experience of&#13;
others. Accordingly, one reason for presenting this study now is as a point&#13;
of reference for others to follow.&#13;
A second set of reasons refer to the motivation of the work&#13;
undertaken. Complementary to the desire to construct a data basis for&#13;
modeling, our purpose has been to evolve methods by which national income&#13;
accounts can be transformed from a documentation of production statistics to a&#13;
potent statement of what an economy is like. We do not claim to have&#13;
succeeded entirely, and this characterization of both national accounts and&#13;
our aspirations for them is admittedly overdrawn. But it would be dishonest&#13;
to withhold that we approach our subject with a certain emotion; and with a&#13;
concomitant concern for data as a step towards some other sort of under-&#13;
standing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xviii -&#13;
This is not, then, simply a text on some statistical methods of&#13;
national accounting applied to Malaysia. If it were, then we would be more&#13;
concerned about the limitations of our work as set out here, since it has&#13;
several features which time, patience and more of the statistician's skill&#13;
could undoubtedly refashion for the better. As it is, we have undertaken our&#13;
study with the fullest cooperation and support, especially from Malaysia, and&#13;
regard the results as a serious factual statement of Malaysia in 1970. In our&#13;
view it provides a legitimate basis for further analysis and commentary within&#13;
the limitations which the text endeavors to describe. There remains much more&#13;
to illustrate than we have been able to exemplify here. But we do feel that&#13;
we now have a basis from which to recommend that accounts for other national&#13;
economies can and should be developed along the lines we have tried to&#13;
illustrate here.&#13;
The motivation for our work has been to develop conventional schemas&#13;
of national accounting so that they cease to revolve around production&#13;
structure and commodity balances. Instead, we see the living standards of&#13;
different socioeconomic groups within society as the focal point of national&#13;
accounting. Production structure and commodity balances are important&#13;
determinants of the setting within which these living standards are&#13;
determined. But they are complementary to the detailed income and outlay&#13;
accounts of households of different types, and by no means a substitute for&#13;
direct information on who receives what as a result of economic activity.&#13;
We make no claim of novelty for this perspective on what national&#13;
accounting ought to be about. But contemporary demonstration of the&#13;
feasibility of accounting in these terms has been lacking, and we have tried&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xix -&#13;
to provide it both in previous studies and in the text which is prefaced by&#13;
these remarks.&#13;
Our present study differs from its antecedents on two counts which go&#13;
beyond the learning-by-doing of successive tasks and a maturing admiration of&#13;
the statistician's craft. Both require some comment in anticipation of the&#13;
discussion in the main text.&#13;
First, we hold firmly to the proposition that data systems require a&#13;
coherent view of the causality and interdependences within the structures they&#13;
attempt to calibrate. In effect a model is needed to define what is relevant&#13;
for empirical measurement, just as the measurements themselves are essential&#13;
to quantitative analysis. In this sense both action and reaction are involved&#13;
in an attempt to decide which dimensions of reality the national accounts&#13;
should measure. Equally, the taxonomies or disaggregations which are adopted&#13;
for each dimension are a variable to be determined through a perspective on&#13;
which distinctions are important and those that are less so. Such issues&#13;
arise immediately from our starting point of concern for the living standards&#13;
of different socioeconomic groups. How are such groups to be defined, and in&#13;
what terms should their living standards be measured? Beyond this we have&#13;
questions about the causality which lies behind the determination of living&#13;
standards, which lead us to query a commodity basis as the only criterion for&#13;
disaggregation of production activity. Even though we lack a fully&#13;
articulated model of how living standards are determined for different&#13;
socioeconomic groups, our perception of the relevant taxonomies has evolved&#13;
through successive studies and therefore affects the approach we have adopted&#13;
here. By no means are all questions which might be asked addressed, let alone&#13;
resolved, in this study. Indeed, to a considerable extent we are obliged to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xx -&#13;
inherent taxonomies which derive from models other than our own, simply&#13;
because they are the only ones available to us. But it remains the case that&#13;
the present study has an advantage over earlier work insofar as it can draw on&#13;
the experience of parallel developments in modeling activity which have been&#13;
taking place over recent years.&#13;
A second area of advantage for the present study lies in the choice&#13;
of Malaysia as the subject of our investigation. There are many aspects to&#13;
this,. but we would like to stress two at this point. The Department of&#13;
Statistics, Kuala Lumpur, has made this study possible from several points of&#13;
view so that our debt to Ramesh Chander, formerly Chief Statistician,&#13;
Government of Malaysia, and S. Gnasegarah, Senior Statistician of the National&#13;
Accounts Division, is overwhelming. For Peninsular (or West) Malaysia&#13;
especially, their work over the years has provided a data base which is vastly&#13;
superior to that in many countries which have significantly more developed&#13;
economies. This represents a remarkable and, in many ways, a unique&#13;
achievement. In allowing us access to this data base, and for their guidance&#13;
through the details, they have provided us with an exceptional opportunity for&#13;
research. We are accordingly indebted and appreciative of their cooperation&#13;
and guidance. They and so many others in the Department of Statistics,&#13;
including Kwok Kwan Kit, Senior Statistician, Prices and Income Division, have&#13;
provided the foundations for our work.&#13;
In a broader context, the present study is the latest in a series of&#13;
collaborative research activities between the Government of Malaysia and the&#13;
World Bank. Our debt to various Malaysia Government agencies is considerable&#13;
because the spirit of these collaborative studies has been so conducive to&#13;
serious work. Throughout, the present study has been seen as an integral part&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xxi -&#13;
of an effort to evolve better methods of economic development planning and&#13;
therefore as having an entirely practical purpose. The encouragement of&#13;
Tan Sri Thong Yaw Hong, former Director General of the Economic Planning Unit,&#13;
in providing this perspective has been invaluable in giving both stimulus and&#13;
significance to the work. Its execution has involved close cooperation with&#13;
the Economic Planning Unit, whose former Deputy Director General, Dr. C. L.&#13;
Robless, played the most significant role in the conception of ths joint&#13;
activity. Members of his staff, too numerous to record, have subsequently&#13;
been involved in the dialogue that has sustained the work. However, we would&#13;
be remiss not to acknowledge the contributions of Mohd Sheriff bin Kassim and&#13;
Abu Bakar bin Abdul Karim over several years.&#13;
Beyond these acknowledgements, there are many others, foremost among&#13;
whom is our former colleague in the Development Research Center of the World&#13;
Bank, Montek Ahluwhalia. The research reported in this study has been a team&#13;
effort from beginning to end. Statistical assistance was provided by Jane&#13;
Denes and her essential contribution is recognized on the title page. Others&#13;
who have contributed significantly to the effort include Suresh Tendulkar who&#13;
was part of the original data gathering mission, and Shail Jain and Elizabeth&#13;
Waelbroeck who provided research assistance. We are happy to have the&#13;
opportunity of expressing our thanks to them here.&#13;
We are also indebted to Will Bussink, Ramesh Chander and Alan Roe for&#13;
their careful and constructive comments on an earlier draft. Each has brought&#13;
to bear particularly relevant experience and has taken an interest in our work&#13;
throughout--Will Bussink as Senior Economist, East Asia and Pacific, in the&#13;
World Bank; Ramesh Chander as former Chief Statistician, Government of&#13;
Malaysia; and Alan Roe as Senior Lecturer at Warwick University and our&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xxii -&#13;
collaborator in several previous studies. We are most grateful to them all.&#13;
Finally, we wish to express our thanks to Anne McKenna, Secretary to&#13;
the project team, who took care of administration throughout. Additionally,&#13;
she shouldered the exceptional burden of typing various drafts and the large,&#13;
unwieldy tables which punctuate the main text. In admiration of her skill and&#13;
with gratitude for her tireless efforts, we simply can offer a very special&#13;
note of acknowledgement. Our thanks also to Nancy Ribeiro who helped so much&#13;
in the latter stages. She willingly shouldered the responsibility of&#13;
incorporating many revisions and preparing the final typescript, together with&#13;
Ann Van Aken, whose help at the last was indispensable.&#13;

CHAPTER 1&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1 Background to the Study&#13;
The subject of this study is the design and construction of an&#13;
economic data framework for Malaysia which provides a suitable basis for&#13;
policy analysis and, in particular, a basis for the investigation of&#13;
employment and income distribution issues. As such, it is part of a broader&#13;
analysis which addresses these questions both from the point of view of data&#13;
systems and in terms of economic models L/ However, to the extent that there&#13;
are a wide class of models which are consistent with this data framework, the&#13;
latter is not dependent on any particular model formulation. Moreover, it is&#13;
felt that this study may contribute something in its own right towards a new&#13;
approach to macroeconomic accounting for developing countries, and therefore&#13;
is worth presenting as a separate study which attempts to explain both the&#13;
design and compilation of the data framework, and some of the thinking that&#13;
lies behind it.&#13;
The origins of national income accounting have been admirably traced&#13;
by Stone_2/ as far back as the 17th century and to Gregory King, who estimated&#13;
various economic magnitudes relating to England for the year 1688. Although&#13;
several significant developments occurred in the 19th century with regard to&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
estimating individual items of the national accounts, not until the late&#13;
1930's was it recognized that the various independent measures of income,&#13;
output and expenditure could be combined and related to each other within an&#13;
accounting framework. Very rapid developments began to take place after this&#13;
time, with national income statistics being compiled for several countries.&#13;
Stone identifies a most important landmark as the meeting of a group of&#13;
statistical experts at the League of Nations, to discuss the measurement of&#13;
the national income and the construction of social accounts.    Their report 1-/&#13;
published by the United Nations in 1947, contained a recommendation that the&#13;
estimation of the national income be set within a social accounting framework,&#13;
and also included a suggested design for such a system.&#13;
Following this first system, there have been others devised under the&#13;
auspices of major international organizations,2/ the latest being the United&#13;
Nations System of National Accounts,3/ often referred to as the new SNA. This&#13;
was published in 1968 and remains as the most authoritative and widely used&#13;
manual of social accounting in existence today. Quite apart from its rigorous&#13;
methodological content, which is widely referred to by government&#13;
statisticians in the Western world for social accounting definitions of the&#13;

most detailed kind, it also contains a less well appreciated, but arguably&#13;
more important, conceptual approach to data systems. Certainly this feature&#13;
is less widely exploited than the definitional content of the SNA.&#13;
The SNA approach is based upon a social accounting matrix framework&#13;
first introduced by Stone and his associates1/ as a basis for a highly&#13;
disaggregated computable model of the UK economy. The social accounting&#13;
matrix (SAM) has been generalized in the SNA document so as to be broadly&#13;
applicable to any nation which is reasonably advanced statistically. However,&#13;
in spite of this, its applicability has typically been confined to the&#13;
developed world, since most developing countries have a limited statistical&#13;
capability and few are in a position to produce sets of social accounts which&#13;
are as demanding as the SNA, taken in its entirety. In many ways one could&#13;
argue that the apparent failure of the SNA as a statistical system of&#13;
universal applicability is due to a misinterpretation of its aims. Instead of&#13;
being seen as a system capable of consolidation and aggregation so as to&#13;
highlight particularly important features of any given economic system, the&#13;
SNA approach has been avoided if it cannot be carried out to the rote. From&#13;
this basis, it is hardly surprising that use of the SNA has, in these cases,&#13;
been confined to its value as a definitional manual.&#13;
This is perhaps the most charitable explanation of the failure to&#13;
fully adopt the SNA in the developing world. A less favorable view would&#13;
simply be that it is inappropriate in is present form to cater for the special&#13;
problems of many of these countries. Indeed, one could draw some support for&#13;
this view from the fact that a short chapter on the adaptation of the full&#13;
1/ Cambridge, Department of Applied Economics (1962-).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
system to developing countries is couched within terms of being 'suggestions'&#13;
rather than 'guidelines', thereby indicating that perhaps the special problems&#13;
of doing so may yet have to be fully worked out. At the same time it can be&#13;
said that while statistical systems remain weak in most developing countries,&#13;
one reason for this is that they often adopt a piecemeal approach. If the SAM&#13;
approach on which the SNA is based were to be seized on as the basic framework&#13;
for developing economic statistics, then there is every chance that the data&#13;
for developing countries would be more reliable, extensive, and meaningful.&#13;
Alongside the historical developments in statistical methodology, new&#13;
visions and objectives have since emerged for the developing world in&#13;
particular. Certainly, at the inception of social accounting in the 1940's --&#13;
and some would argue even as recently as a decade ago -- economic policy&#13;
objectives centered around the maximization of key aggregates such as gross&#13;
national product or per capita GNP. A prime requirement for servicing and&#13;
monitoring such policy is the derivation of sets of fairly aggregative&#13;
national income accounts. Nowadays there is more widespread recognition and&#13;
acceptance of distributional objectives for development, and such highly&#13;
aggregative accounts of the macroeconomy are largely, if not totally,&#13;
inadequate for this purpose. To support the new objectives far more detail is&#13;
necessary, involving multi-way disaggregations of major aggregates in order to&#13;
evaluate the effects of change on individual groups or sectors, no matter&#13;
whether such change is truly exogenous or policy-induced within the system.&#13;
And the limitations of summary national accounts are not simply confined to&#13;
the problems of insufficient detail. It is easy to conceptualize that the&#13;
economic data system ought to accommodate certain imputations beyond those&#13;
already included as accepted convention. For example, in portraying the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
distribution of income across various groups and classes of recipient,&#13;
institutional transfers (particularly from government) could reflect certain&#13;
benefits in kind, such as health care, education and welfare services 1.    In&#13;
short, statistical practices may be unnecessarily constrained by obsolete&#13;
conventions, designed to service objectives of yesteryear and no longer&#13;
appropriate to the needs of new development strategies.&#13;
One purpose of this study is to illustrate an approach to&#13;
macroeconomic data frameworks which hopefully will further contribute towards&#13;
a redirection of future statistical efforts. Its roots are firmly based in&#13;
the SNA and, in particular, the display of social accounts in matrix form.&#13;
But there is more to it than this, including further justification for a view&#13;
suggested by earlier country studies, viz., that reconciliation of apparently&#13;
dissimilar data can be carried further than is usually entertained by&#13;
utilizing the constraints inherent in a social accounting matrix framework.&#13;
Thus more data sources can be deployed and more detailed disaggregations can&#13;
be sustained to provide a richer, more illuminating data base for policy&#13;
analysis than national accounts can usually convey. Not least, within our&#13;
system we can answer the important question of: "Who gets what out of the&#13;
national product?" And the answer is tied into the more conventional issues&#13;
of production structure, balance of payments, savings/investment, etc.&#13;
Accordingly, from our approach we hope to begin to understand distributional&#13;
issues as an integral part of economic development and strategy, and not as a&#13;
mere appendage.&#13;

1.2 Nature and Significance of a SAM&#13;
A social accounting matrix (SAM) can be considered as a particular&#13;
representation of a set of double entry accounts for an economic system.&#13;
However, instead of being shown in double entry form, the accounts are&#13;
arranged so that they represent the rows and columns of a matrix; by&#13;
convention, receipts (incomings) are shown along the rows, and payments&#13;
(outgoings) down the columns. A cell entry in the matrix relates to a&#13;
particular transaction or transfer within the economy. The column in which it&#13;
is placed shows the account from which the flow originates, whilst the account&#13;
to which it is destined is identified by the row. It follows that one&#13;
precondition for a set of social accounts to be represented in matrix form is&#13;
that they must be fully articulated: that is, each entry must appear in one&#13;
account as a credit and some other account as a debit. In the SAM&#13;
representation, however, each transaction or transfer appears once only, where&#13;
the appropriate cell entry simultaneously shows the crediting and debiting&#13;
accounts.&#13;
It is clear that the matrix representation of a complete system of&#13;
social accounts owes much to the input-output approach to the structural&#13;
interdependence of production in the economy. However, a SAM extends this&#13;
rather restricted domain of interdependence to embrace other interconnections&#13;
within the macroeconomic system. Interrelations are generally identified&#13;
between and within four basic groups of accounts: domestic institutions'&#13;
current accounts; the corresponding capital accounts for institutions;&#13;
production accounts; and accounts relating to transactions with the rest of&#13;
the world. These are the four basic groups of accounts which are contained in&#13;
most accounting systems. By implication, a fundamental SNA premise -- that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accounts can be divided into current and capital accounts, with a&#13;
complementary relationship existing between the two -- ip being maintained.&#13;
Ihe distinction between current and capital accounts is defined here with the&#13;
usual reference to an accounting period of one year. Furthermore, since&#13;
institutions are the only bodies with the legal right of ownership, only they&#13;
can save and accumulate. Institutions' accounts are therefore divided into&#13;
separate current and capital accounts, as are those for the rest of the world&#13;
which is treated as an additional 'institution.' The production accounts, on&#13;
the other hand, do not divide in this way: their role is to embrace the&#13;
accounts of the various production activities which generate value added, and&#13;
of the factors of production which provide services employed by production&#13;
activities.&#13;
Departures from the SNA in our SAM approach to an information system&#13;
for Malaysia can largely be ascribed to differences in classification,&#13;
disaggregation, and arrangement of the matrix and its data. In some instances&#13;
omissions are forced upon us; for example, our information system is made up&#13;
entirely of flows and excludes balance sheet entries. This is clearly far&#13;
from ideal. One implication is that, while the data system can identify&#13;
several manifestations of income distribution, it contains no direct&#13;
information on the distribution of asset ownership or wealth within the&#13;
economy. The incorporation of such detail remains as a target for some future&#13;
SAM exercise."Y&#13;
1/ The conceptual issues involved are discussed in the SNA and, as an&#13;
extension of the present approach, in Pyatt and Thorbecke, op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The nature of the SAM approach can perhaps be best illustrated with&#13;
reference to a particular framework. Table 1.1 sets out the relevant main&#13;
classes of accounts that form the structure of the Malaysian SAM described in&#13;
this volume. Most of these accounts will later be sub-divided into more&#13;
detailed accounts but, for the present, the broad classes of accounts will&#13;
serve to highlight its main structure.I/&#13;
An aspect of the considerations which have led to proposing a SAM&#13;
framework as in Table 1.1 is that the classifications and the arrangement of&#13;
accounts within a SAM ought to serve a dual purpose. In the first place, the&#13;
SAM should be in a form which is adequate to display existing macroeconomic&#13;
data according to conventional accounting procedures. Thus, for example, it&#13;
succeeds only if traditional national accounts are an identifiable part of it,&#13;
and hence if aggregates such as GNP and GDP can be readily ascertained2/&#13;
Secondly, it should extend conventional accounts far beyond this, and embrace&#13;
classifications which are capable of tracing the essential interconnections&#13;
throughout the economic system. Simultaneously with this, the classifications&#13;
must reflect those areas of particular concern to policy makers in planning to&#13;
meet their development objectives. It is with this latter purpose in mind&#13;
that in Table 1.1 the accounts described as 'Wants' and 'Factors' are&#13;
1/ It will seem from Table 1.1 that the notion of four basic accounts has&#13;
been lost. But it can be noted that this can easily be resurrected if the&#13;
accounts are rearranged so as to embrace 'Indirect Taxes' within&#13;
institutions' current accounts, and 'Wants' and 'Factors' within&#13;
production accounts. It is preferable, however, to focus discussion upon&#13;
the expanded set of basic accounts in Table 1.1 simply because this new&#13;
structure illustrates some of the principal features of the SAM approach&#13;
adopted here.&#13;
2/ The fact that our SAM satisfies this criterion is demonstrated in the next&#13;
chapter, in Section 2.1.&#13;

introduced in our schema (occupying the first two rows and columns of the&#13;
table). Since these accounts constitute departures from the SNA format, they&#13;
require further elaboration.&#13;
Whatever mix of development objectives is chosen as the basis for&#13;
policy -- involving growth, redistribution, employment and elimination of&#13;
poverty -- the resulting composite objective is inevitably bound up with the&#13;
living standards of individuals. This in turn translates into the supply and&#13;
demands for basic needs or wants and for supernumerary wants which can be&#13;
satisfied at higher levels of incomel' Our system of accounts attempts to&#13;
allow for this by commencing (in row and column 1) with a display of demands&#13;
for basic and supernumerary wants by households. In principle these wants&#13;
should relate to requirements of items such as food, clothing, housing,&#13;
education, leisure, and so on. In a fully developed system, therefore, wants&#13;
would embrace rather more than consumers' expenditure, and would involve&#13;
certain imputations of benefits, e.g. from public expenditure, if the SAM is&#13;
to be expressed in money terms. However, for the present, such imputations&#13;
are an ideal that has yet to be achieved, so that the cell entry in the first&#13;
row of Table 1.1 refers quite simply to a set of expenditures by households of&#13;
various types upon various categories of consumer goods and services. The&#13;
demands for these wants (in row 1) are then met by supplies of commodities (in&#13;
column 1). These mappings illustrate the functional use of a SAM as both an&#13;
informational and an analytical device. The framework ensures complete&#13;
consistency between demands for, and supplies of, commodities for household&#13;
consumption; yet it preserves the classifications that are most meaningful to&#13;
1/ For an elaboration of this approach, see Pyatt and Thorbecke, op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
describe household wants (or the goods they buy) on the one hand, and the&#13;
ultimate requirements from the pool of commodity supplies, on the other.&#13;
The second class of accounts in Table 1.1 identify the receipt and&#13;
disbursement of factor incomes within the economy. Factor income is derived&#13;
both from domestic activities of production as well as from abroad. This is&#13;
shown in the second row, whilst the allocation of this factor income between&#13;
domestic institutions, and payments abroad of factor income, are shown down&#13;
the second column. As with the wants accounts, there are many accounts&#13;
implicit within the broad class of factor accounts. Factor incomes can be&#13;
(and indeed are) disaggregated far beyond broad classes of returns to labor,&#13;
rent on dwellings and return to capital in our empirical work. In particular,&#13;
a substantial disaggregation according to the different types of labor&#13;
required by production activities is thought to be especially useful in&#13;
understanding the process by which labor demands are generated, and in&#13;
matching these demands with the supplies of labor that are available.&#13;
Moreover, households comprise individuals, who supply their labor (factor)&#13;
services to production and in return receive incomes out of which households&#13;
can satisfy their wants. The precise behavioural mechanisms are not discussed&#13;
in this study, but we do attempt to provide a statistical picture of the&#13;
details ofsuch linkages as a first step towards understanding their&#13;
importance. Similarly we also consider it useful to distinguish different&#13;
types of capital within the framework, the prime purpose being once more to&#13;
identify the eventual recipients of profits that accrue to activities as a&#13;
surplus of value added over payments to labor and rent on dwellings. One&#13;
consequence of making these distinctions or disaggregations between factors is&#13;
that the row account totals for each factor give a detailed view of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
functional, or factoral, distribution of income within the economy, while the&#13;
column entries in the factor accounts spell out who receives these factor&#13;
incomes. A feature of this detailed approach is that it retains full&#13;
information on conventional aggregates. For example, Gross Domestic Product&#13;
at factor cost is readily identifiable as the total value added of all&#13;
production activities, whilst Gross National Product at factor cost is simply&#13;
the row (or column) sum, net of factor payments made abroad.&#13;
In Table 1.1 the current accounts for institutions are broadly split&#13;
into three categories: households, corporate enterprises (companies) and&#13;
government, in accordance with most conventional systems. Households and&#13;
companies are the domestic institutional recipients of factor income, but in&#13;
addition to this they also receive and disburse further amounts as transfer&#13;
payments. A principal activity of government is to partake in this transfer&#13;
or redistributive process, and in some economic systems can be viewed as&#13;
assuming a major role. Government income is entirely non-factor (or transfer)&#13;
income; receiving, for example, direct taxes and social security payments from&#13;
households, direct taxes from private companies and operating surpluses of&#13;
government-owned enterprises, as well as current transfers from abroad. This&#13;
is matched by expenditures on commodities for government purposesl4/ as well&#13;
as transfers to households (social security benefits, etc.), companies and the&#13;
rest of the world. Households receive transfers from companies, in the form&#13;
of distributed profits, as well as those from government. Furthermore, at a&#13;
lower level of disaggregation, transfers of income may take place between&#13;
1/ It has previously been noted that it would be preferable to treat these&#13;
items as government provision of wants for the various household groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
various categories of household, and between categories of government. (For&#13;
the types of economies currently being considered, inter-company transfers are&#13;
less likely, although conceptually possible.) The result of accounting for&#13;
all receipts of factoral income by institutions and of transfers (non-factor&#13;
income) between institutions is a further manifestation of the distribution of&#13;
income. In particular, the distribution of income between various types of&#13;
household can be derived, given that each type is allowed a separate account&#13;
within the overall schema. Nor need interesting disaggregations be confined&#13;
to households. It may also be of interest to disaggregate the corporate&#13;
sector according to ownership; for example, domestic versus foreign&#13;
ownership. However, the prime distributional information appropriate to&#13;
income and the institution accounts is likely to be centered around&#13;
households, since this is ultimately bound up with the ability or inability of&#13;
households to satisfy their wants, and hence with their living standards.&#13;
Progressing further through accounts of the SAM shown in Table 1.1,&#13;
the next group of accounts are a set of capital accounts. In principle, a&#13;
separate capital account could be identified for each of the institutional&#13;
current accounts distinguished in classes 3, 4 and 5. In practice, our&#13;
Malaysian experience confirms the view suggested by earlier case studies, that&#13;
adequate data are not available to support anything other than a consolidated&#13;
capital account for domestic institutions. This is not to say that useful&#13;
information cannot be gleaned from this account. Receipts (along the row) of&#13;
account 6 show savings (transfers from current to capital account) of each&#13;
domestic institution, together with net capital transfers from the rest of the&#13;
world. This provides the necessary finance for gross domestic fixed capital&#13;
formation and changes in stocks. Consolidation of the capital accounts for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
the domestic institution simply means that capital transfers between them&#13;
(flow of funds) are netted out 1/&#13;
In Table 1.1 separate current and capital accounts are distinguished&#13;
for the rest of the world, and entries occupying the credits and debits of&#13;
these accounts follow standard conventions. For example, exports of goods and&#13;
services are shown as an outgoing from the rest of the world current account&#13;
and an incoming to the commodity account which supplies them. Similarly, the&#13;
balance of payments current account surplus is shown as a negative element in&#13;
the cell that records transfers from rest of world current (debit) to rest of&#13;
world capital (credit). This reflects the fact that from the rest of the&#13;
world point of view such an outcome is a 'dissaving', whilst from the view of&#13;
the domestic economy this deficit is a 'saving', i.e. it represents funds&#13;
available to finance domestic investment.&#13;
The penultimate rows and columns of Table 1.1 relate to separate&#13;
accounts for production activities and the commodities which they produce.&#13;
This follows the SNA proposals in outline, but like so many other aspects of&#13;
the Malaysian SAM, detailed application departs from their recommendations.&#13;
Commodity demands are shown along the commodities row, according to accounts&#13;
for which these demands are treated as a debit. These include intermediate&#13;
demands by activities for further production of commodities. However, in our&#13;
SAM as distinct from the SNA, all demands are valued at purchasers' prices, so&#13;
1/ These capital transfers would otherwise occupy the sub-matrix of cells&#13;
intersecting the separate row and column capital accounts of each&#13;
institution in a similar way to the current transfers sub-matrix to be&#13;
found at the intersection of the institutions' current accounts. Pyatt&#13;
and Thorbecke, op. cit. sets out an extended version of Table 1.1 which&#13;
includes separate capital accounts for each institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
that in matching total commodity demands with commodity supplies (column&#13;
account 9), domestic supplies (inclusive of trade and transport margins) have&#13;
to be supplemented not only by imports but also by duties and other indirect&#13;
taxes. These indirect taxes are collected in row 11 and arise from commodity&#13;
taxes (net of subsidies), plus non-commodity indirect taxes such as fees and&#13;
licenses. These are debited from the indirect tax account in column 11 and&#13;
credited to the government current account.&#13;
One overall effect of extending and displaying a set of national&#13;
accounts in the format of a social accounting matrix as in Table 1.1 is that&#13;
flows within and between various parts of the economy can be recorded and&#13;
followed through according to the processes that actually occur in the flux&#13;
and flow of economic activity. It is for this reason that the 'Wants' and&#13;
'Factors' accounts are chosen to occupy the leading position in the matrix,&#13;
relegating the engine room of the economic system, i.e. the production&#13;
accounts (which are traditionally placed in the leading diagonal of a matrix&#13;
of social accounts), to a less prominent location. The result is that the&#13;
data system incorporates the translation of factoral incomes into household&#13;
incomes and then, through wants, into demands on the production system through&#13;
which factoral incomes are regenerated. The three dimensions in this mapping&#13;
process -- (a) the factoral distribution of value added; (b) the household&#13;
distribution of income; and (c) the structure of production between a set of&#13;
production activities -- are all clearly distinguished and exemplified by the&#13;
SAM. But these steps are also neatly subsumed within a complete system for&#13;
the economy as a whole, so that overall consistency is maintained while&#13;
recording the details of each linkage in the economic process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
This feature of a SAM framework -- that it provides a set of&#13;
consistency constraints upon the various relationships within it -- is&#13;
discussed in more detail at several points in subsequent chapters. For now it&#13;
may suffice to point out that, aside from many compilational advantages, it is&#13;
an important psychological feature not readily apparent in a conventional&#13;
display. It explicitly engages the notion that every payment has a&#13;
destination and every receipt an origin. Such an obvious feature can easily&#13;
be overlooked in an accounting system which is not articulated in a matrix&#13;
framework. As it is, such a framework proves to be an invaluable aid to the&#13;
empirical estimation of the SAM, as well as defining and displaying the&#13;
restrictions that must be placed upon whatever behavioural relationships&#13;
describe the economic process by which the magnitudes are generated.&#13;
1.3 An Overview of the SAM Compilation for Malaysia&#13;
In the previous section, certain advantages of the SAM approach to&#13;
macroeconomic data frameworks have been argued. Although there appear to be&#13;
decided advantages on conceptual grounds, particularly with regard to the&#13;
potential for formal analysis and policy, there are also several advantages&#13;
that arise from the purely statistical standpoint of making the best use of&#13;
available data.   In many ways Malaysia has proved to be an excellent country&#13;
to study for utilization of the SAM approach. This section discusses some&#13;
aspects of the overall application so as to set the scene for the more&#13;
detailed description of sources and methods that is to follow in later&#13;
chapters, and to contrast the Malaysia study with previous SAM studies which&#13;
are its antecedents.&#13;
It is well known that accounting data are generally of quite variable&#13;
quality for many economic systems. This is particularly so for developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
countries where lacunae are fairly commonplace and injunctions to exercising&#13;
extreme caution in using certain series ought often to be heeded. There is a&#13;
well-rehearsed debate as to whether data of dubious quality is better or worse&#13;
than no data at all. This is essentially meaningless outside a particular&#13;
context and here we are concerned to note that in some real sense a social&#13;
accounting matrix framework does provide many implicit, as well as explicit,&#13;
constraints on the data which enter into it. Specifically, the framework sets&#13;
bounds on the possible range certain values can take, given other entries in&#13;
the table. Data cannot be retained in the framework independent of such&#13;
consistency checks. This leads, therefore, to a substantial practical appeal&#13;
for the consistency framework underlying the social accounting matrix in&#13;
making partial use of data which may be otherwise inadequate. At the same&#13;
time, it can also be noted that multiple estimates, almost as much as non-&#13;
existent data, can be the bane of a planner's task. In some cases, reasons&#13;
for multiple estimates can be readily explained by differing bases of&#13;
measurement, for example,!/ but in other instances the differences arise&#13;
because surveys have been carried out by more than one department. Either way&#13;
(and there are many other possibilities), it is hard to concede that a&#13;
rationalization of such inconsistent estimates can be detrimental to an&#13;
overall understanding of the mechanism of the economy. At least, this is the&#13;
spirit in which our SAM is constructed. At worst, it is simply a matter of&#13;
crudely adjusting some data to accord with others. At best, sources are&#13;
selected and details are fitted together so that the structure of the whole&#13;
1/ Examples are legion: common ones are calendar year as against financial&#13;
year; trade statistics being collected according to shipment, receipt or&#13;
even dates of invoicing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
macroeconomy is in balance to reflect a distilation of the available data on&#13;
commodity transactions, incomes and outlays, and transactions with the rest of&#13;
the world. In short, the object is to present the most accurate quantitative&#13;
picture that available data will allow.&#13;
Studies in which the SAM consistency approach to data frameworks has&#13;
been attempted are now mounting in number. Prominent amongst the earlier of&#13;
these at the economy-wide level are those for Iran,-Y Sri Lanka2/ and&#13;
Swaziland,3/ while a comparative discussion of these three studies is given in&#13;
Pyatt and Round (1977) 4/ These studies differed substantially with regard to&#13;
the amount of information available for constructing a SAM. Sri Lanka had an&#13;
input-output table available, whereas Swaziland had none at the time the&#13;
studies were undertaken. On the other hand, Sri Lanka had completed a fairly&#13;
comprehensive Socio-Economic Survey for Households, whilst Iran, and even more&#13;
so Swaziland, had particularly meagre household information. Swaziland,&#13;
nevertheless, had some especially useful trade data. The experiences were&#13;
therefore quite varied, showing only the common difficulty that gaps in data,&#13;
and multiple estimates, are the typical problems to be faced when a SAM is to&#13;
be constructed.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
This variety of experience has been enriched by numerous subsequent&#13;
studies. Important amoung these is a SAM-based study of the Muda region of&#13;
Malaysia, which takes on board both regional accounting problems and the&#13;
application of cost-benefit techniques in relation to the impact of a major&#13;
irrigation problem.!/ Beyond this, an important sequence of SAM studies at&#13;
the national level has been the subject of a cooperative programme sponsored&#13;
by the Overseas Development Ministry, London, and Warwick University. This&#13;
has involved work in Botswana, Kenya and Fiji, and has inter alia not only&#13;
added considerably to experience but also opened up important new areas,&#13;
notably the disaggregation of capital accounts and flow of funds.2/&#13;
As a background to the conceptual framework for our Malaysia SAM&#13;
which was presented in the previous section, the sequence of studies hitherto&#13;
undertaken in other countries show an interesting succession of improvements&#13;
to an early and rather basic frame. Thus, none of the previous studies have&#13;
embraced a set of 'Wants' accounts as such. For Iran, the factor accounts&#13;
were not included, so that factor incomes were shown as being paid by&#13;
production activities direct to various household groups, which in turn were&#13;
defined on the basis of household income. Some distributional classifications&#13;
were therefore incorporated into the household accounts whilst the SAM was&#13;
completed for other accounts in a fairly aggregative way. The Sri Lanka SAM,&#13;
on the other hand, embraced factor accounts as well as those for sectors of&#13;
production. However, in this study the production accounts did not&#13;
distinguish activities from the commodities which they produce; this&#13;
1/ See Bell, Hazell and Slade (1982).&#13;
2/ Some of this work is reviewed in Allen (1980) and Hayden and Round (1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
improvement was not implemented until the Swaziland study. However, for Sri&#13;
Lanka, some tabulations from their 1970 Socio-Economic Survey enabled progress&#13;
to be made in distinguishing some factor and institution current accounts,&#13;
albeit with limitations.&#13;
In many respects the study for Malaysia is substantially different:&#13;
for Peninsular Malaysia it has afforded a unique opportunity to work at a most&#13;
detailed level with unusually rich sources of primary data. However, for East&#13;
Malaysia (comprising the states of Sabah and Sarawak) data for 1970 are&#13;
significantly inferior to the relatively advanced statistical material that is&#13;
available for the Peninsula. Accordingly, the Malaysian SAM is, in a real&#13;
sense, an amalgam of two SAMs of quite different statistical quality and each&#13;
presenting its own unique challenges. In Chapter 7, the accounts for East&#13;
Malaysia are discussed in their own right, and offer some insights as to how a&#13;
SAM may be constructed from fragmentary data, together with some inter-country&#13;
comparisons. Meanwhile, the discussion in Chapters 2 to 6 focusses on the&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia accounts which are based largely on detailed primary data&#13;
as previously noted.&#13;
Three major sources of primary data have been available and heavily&#13;
utilized in computing the Peninsular Malaysia SAM. First, there is a set of&#13;
input-output tables for the year 1970 .1/ These are almost unique in the&#13;
experience of developing countries in that they represent a serious attempt to&#13;
adopt the SNA format for presentation of the Malaysian national accounts. As&#13;
part of the SNA system, the commodity balances (matching commodity supplies&#13;
with their demands) are quite central, since the task of tracing commodities&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
through the system, once achieved, gives rise to benchmarks for other account&#13;
transactions and transfers. The Malaysian input-output tables have been&#13;
carefully compiled. They are published with reference to a 59 sector and&#13;
commodity disaggregation, so that 'make' and 'technology' matrices are shown&#13;
separately. There is also considerable detail on margins such as commodity&#13;
taxes, transport and wholesale and retail trade 1/&#13;
A new series of national accounts,2/ commencing for 1969, have been&#13;
built up from the input-output tables and constitute our second major data&#13;
source. By virtue of their underlying consistency, the input-output tables&#13;
can be taken as a major contribution towards the disaggregation and expansion&#13;
of the National Accounts for 1970 into a SAM framew'ork as in Table 1.1.&#13;
However, some manipulations of data are required foi this since the input-&#13;
output tables express commodity balances at basic prices as recommended in the&#13;
UN SNA. It has already been noted that we prefer to express such balances at&#13;
market prices and the detailed arguments are given in Chapter 5. In effect,&#13;
the required manipulations 'undo' some of the data adjustments needed to go&#13;
from source data to the published tables. Thus our preferred approach is&#13;
simpler insofar as it is closer to source data. In the current instance,&#13;
however, to effect this simplification required some substantial 'undoing' of&#13;
previous adjustments. Chapter 5 sets out at length the relationship between&#13;
our preferred approach to commodity accounts and that of the SNA.&#13;

Section 5.4.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Apart from this modification of commodity accounts, the main effort&#13;
in generating a 1970 SAM for Peninsular Malaysia has focussed on factor&#13;
accounts and the income and outlay accounts for different types of&#13;
households. This is perhaps the main area in which the present study breaks&#13;
new ground. In doing so, the third primary data source has been used&#13;
extensively: viz. the 1973 Household Expenditure Survey (HES). This survey&#13;
has been particularly valuable in generating the household accounts and&#13;
Chapter 3 sets out the detailed procedures used and the methods of&#13;
reconciliation between the survey and the National Accounts 1/&#13;
The three principal data sources -- the input-output tables, the&#13;
detailed national income accounts, and the Household Expenditure Survey --&#13;
were supplemented by a good deal of additional data at all stages. Estimates&#13;
from the Third Malaysia Plan; the Inland Revenue Statistics; the 1970 Census&#13;
of Population; various Labor Force Surveys; a Financial Survey of Limited&#13;
Companies; unpublished data provided to us by the Department of Statistics in&#13;
Malaysia and other government departments; together these provided the main&#13;
support to the principal sources referred to above. However, it is also&#13;
important to emphasize that the results to be presented in subsequent chapters&#13;
have evolved through discussion and evaluation at various intermediate&#13;
stages. They have undoubtedly benefitted from this process which has served&#13;
1/ The 1973 HES Survey was used rather than the 1970 Post Enumeration Survey&#13;
(PES) because of the richness of detail in the former compared with the&#13;
latter. This is notwithstanding the obvious advantage that the PES&#13;
relates directly to our base year (1970) and involves a much larger sample&#13;
-- 133,025 persons as opposed to 19,123 for HES. However, PES has been&#13;
used partially in some respects and the results obtained here have been&#13;
considered relative to those in a detailed analysis of PES. See Anand&#13;
(1977) and (1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
us well in wanting to avoid, for example, a set of final tables encumbered by&#13;
unidentified items and residual errors.&#13;
In the presentation which follows, the income accounts for households&#13;
are discussed in Chapter 3. These receive a particular level and distribution&#13;
of factor incomes. This level must reconcile with the total of value added&#13;
generated in the production accounts, which are discussed in Chapter 5. These&#13;
two aspects require a consistent, detailed treatment of value added by factors&#13;
and by activities, and this provides the subject matter of Chapter 4. It also&#13;
provides one of the most difficult parts of our analysis since potential&#13;
errors elsewhere in the accounts are brought together at this point as a&#13;
result of the sequential procedures we have chosen to adopt in generating the&#13;
estimates.&#13;
Notwithstanding the eventual emphasis of the SAM towards the Wants,&#13;
Factors and Household accounts, it is not necessarily the best approach to&#13;
expedite the SAM construction by deriving estimates in this order and&#13;
following with other accounts of the system. Given that the National Accounts&#13;
are taken as the benchmark for all aggregates in the SAM, it is practical to&#13;
admit the commodity balances, through the input-output tables, as a central&#13;
and early part of compilation procedure. The Wants accounts are, in fact,&#13;
less of a problem since they emerge from certain mappings of consumer goods&#13;
and services which are shown in the input-output tables. The situation is&#13;
that the production accounts can be tackled directly with the aid of the&#13;
input-output tables, and these also give rise to estimates of value added by&#13;
activity. The household accounts can also be estimated directly, using the&#13;
HES survey, suitably adjusted to National Accounts controls. Between the two&#13;
lie the factor accounts, with factor incomes mapping from production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

activities, and to the household and other institution accounts. The&#13;
formation of the factor accounts as an interface between the production and&#13;
institution accounts in this way provides a very useful check on the&#13;
consistency of data within the system, quite apart from its analytical value&#13;
discussed earlier. In the approach we have adopted, the mapping of labor&#13;
income payments through the factor accounts is facilitated by a manpower&#13;
matrix, showing the employment of individuals engaged in various activities of&#13;
production, and a household endowments matrix, showing the factor endowments&#13;
of different types of households. These are obtained from the HES and the&#13;
1970 Population Census 1/&#13;
In the next chapter, an aggregate SAM for Peninsular Malaysia for&#13;
1970 is presented and discussed, together with a guide to subsequent chapters&#13;
where detailed methodology and disaggregations are described. In Chapters 2&#13;
to 6, these details refer to Peninsular Malaysia as previously noted.&#13;
Accounts for East Malaysia then provide the subject matter for Chapter 7; and&#13;
in Chapter 8 the two sets of regional accounts are brought together to provide&#13;
our final SAM for all Malaysia in 1970. Inevitably this involves us in&#13;
consideration of regional accounting schemas and the problems of aggregating&#13;
over the regional dimension. In the absence of agreed standards in this&#13;
field, our particular approach may be of some general interest, and&#13;
constitutes another area in which this study attempts to break new ground.&#13;
Finally, in Chapter 9, we present some conclusions. In part, these&#13;
are simply numerical results for transactions in East, West and All Malaysia&#13;

which can provide a basis for subsequent analysis. They are more aggregative&#13;
than the details set out in the text, both in terms of the number of digits&#13;
recorded and from the point of view of classifications. With respect to&#13;
digits, it is simply our practice to work at a higher level of detail than the&#13;
base data seem to justify. Therefore, in presenting final results, we have&#13;
rounded off the numbers to a level at which the last digit is more likely to&#13;
be meaningful. With respect to classifications, a recurring problem&#13;
throughout this study is the need to define appropriate criteria for the&#13;
disaggregation of accounts, and to gauge the extent to which disaggregation is&#13;
both justified by primary data and desirable from the point of view of the&#13;
insights to be gained. Our treatment is more detailed in the first instance&#13;
than the data or results will ultimately warrant. Hence in Chapter 9 we&#13;
present a more aggregative picture of East, West and All Malaysia in which the&#13;
subdivision of accounts is restricted to the use of categories which prove to&#13;
be both numerically and descriptively significant.&#13;
Chapter 9 also sets out our conclusions on the methodology of this&#13;
study and its relevance for development policy. We consider that the results&#13;
justify the adoption of a similar approach in other countries: the present&#13;
work and that which we have undertaken previously, clearly show that this can&#13;
be done. Some outstanding problems remain. But there should be no doubt that&#13;
it is relevant to approach national income accounting with the question: Who&#13;
gets what through the process of economic activity? This volume sets out some&#13;
procedures for attempting an answer.&#13;

CHAPTER 2&#13;
THE PENINSULAR MALAYSIAN SAM IN OUTLINE&#13;
2.1 An Aggregate SAM for Peninsular Malaysia&#13;
An initial objective of this study has been to produce a fairly&#13;
detailed social accounting matrix for the whole of Malaysia. While an attempt&#13;
to meet this objective is discussed in Chapter 8, following a discussion of&#13;
the construction of the accounts for East Malaysia in Chapter 7, the results&#13;
are somewhat more tenuous than the accounts for Peninsular Malaysia.&#13;
Therefore, in order to attempt an understanding of the structure of a SAM,&#13;
some aggregate results for Peninsular Malaysia are presented in this chapter.&#13;
The chapter begins with a commentary on the most aggregative version&#13;
of the SAM that preserves its underlying structure. This corresponds exactly&#13;
with the schematic version which was shown as Table 1.1. Although the main&#13;
emphasis of the other chapters is towards disaggregations of many of these&#13;
accounts, it is useful to show the relationship between the SAM and certain of&#13;
the main national accounting aggregates. This is discussed in Section 2.2.&#13;
The third section then serves as a 'Reader's Guide' to those parts of the&#13;
chapters where sources and methods, and in some cases significantly more&#13;
detail and disaggregation of the estimates, can be found. With this is mind,&#13;
and because the SAM format of the social accounts requires careful&#13;
understanding, all reference to sources will be deferred until later&#13;
chapters. Finally, in Section 2.4, the full dimensions of the SAM are&#13;
introduced by showing complete income and outlay accounts for each of the&#13;
individual accounts in the system. As will be seen, no fewer than 212&#13;
separate accounts are distinguished in the system for Peninsular Malaysia as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
result of disaggregations within the 11 principal accounts set out in&#13;
Table 1.1.&#13;
The accounting structure underlying the aggregative accounts for&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia has already been presented in Table 1.1. The eleven&#13;
principal accounts represented by the rows and columns of this table contain&#13;
seven broad groups of accounts, as follows:&#13;
(i) Wants Accounts&#13;
(ii) Factor Accounts&#13;
(iii) Institutions Current Accounts&#13;
(a) Households (including unincorporated business)&#13;
(b) Companies, or Corporate Enterprises&#13;
(c) Government (including Central, State and Local&#13;
Government, plus the Employees (Social Security)&#13;
Provident Fund)&#13;
(iv) Consolidated Capital Accounts (for domestic institutions)&#13;
(v) Rest of the World Accounts&#13;
(a) Current&#13;
(b) Capital&#13;
(vi) Production Accounts&#13;
(a) Commodities&#13;
(b) Activities&#13;
(vii) Indirect Taxes&#13;
The framework for these eleven classes of accounts is reproduced in&#13;
Table 2.1. Although some of these accounts are further disaggregated in later&#13;
chapters, the cells of the matrix shown in Table 2.1 represent the aggregate&#13;
flows between these principal accounts, in order to highlight the relationship&#13;

between them. The flows are shown in units of millions of Malaysian dollars,&#13;
as indeed will be the convention throughout this study. For clarity this will&#13;
not be specifically referred to alongside each estimate that is presented.&#13;
Moreover, the final digit in Table 2.1 and subsequent empirical results has&#13;
been used essentially as a means of presenting data without rounding errors.&#13;
Provided it is understood that no significance attaches to this digit, the&#13;
approach seemed preferable to an otherwise pervasive problem of rounding.&#13;
Each column of Table 2.1 shows total payments or 'outgoings' from the&#13;
account in question to each of the other accounts identified by the rows.!'&#13;
It follows that each row contains receipts from the accounts specified by the&#13;
columns. Since outgoings must equal receipts for each account, each row sum&#13;
must equal each corresponding column sum. One of the basic disciplines that a&#13;
social accounting matrix introduces in tracing the disaggregated flows in the&#13;
economy is that the basic accounting balance between receipts and expenditures&#13;
for each account must be preserved. Thus, taking the second row and column of&#13;
the SAM, which shows the receipts and payments by factors of production, it&#13;
can be observed that total receipts of factor income equals 9,258, consisting&#13;
of 9,038 received as total value added payments from the domestic activities&#13;
of production,2/ and 219 received as payments of factor services from abroad.&#13;
Column 2 records outgoings from this account and shows factors of production&#13;
1/ Empty cells indicate that there are no (direct) transactions between the&#13;
corresponding row and column accounts.&#13;
2/ The production activities include producers of government services and&#13;
domestic services, so that this cell does indeed include the sum total of&#13;
value added payments.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
paving 7,320 to households, 1,402 as gross profits to all companies,./ and 536&#13;
to the Rest of the World in the form of current factor payments. The total&#13;
*outgoings in column 2 are 9,258, which are equal to total receipts by factors.&#13;
The interrelationship between the accounts can be seen by tracing the&#13;
aggregate flows around the social accounting matrix. The household account&#13;
receives 7,320 as factor payments in the form of wages (basic plus imputed&#13;
wages from unincorporated businesses), rents on dwellings (including imputed&#13;
values for owner-occupied dwellings), and unincorporated business profits. In&#13;
addition, however, they receive 98 from companies (distributed profits), 171&#13;
from government (social security), 16 as current transfers from the Rest of&#13;
the World, as well as 402 in the form of inter-household transfers; giving&#13;
total receipts by households of 8,007 as shown in the row sum of account 3.&#13;
This gross income is then distributed as follows: 6,349 is current household&#13;
expenditure on the satisfaction of wants, 352 in tax and social security&#13;
payments to Government, 402 as inter-household transfers, and 904 as savings&#13;
(shown as a transfer to the capital accounts). The 6,349 devoted to want&#13;
satisfaction is translated into purchases of commodities of that amount in&#13;
column 1. In aggregate this may appear to be a singularly uninteresting&#13;
mapping since the wants accounts have only one entry in both the row and&#13;
column. However, the significance of this mapping emerges upon&#13;
disaggregation, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.&#13;
The company accounts (row and column 4) show receipts of factor&#13;
income, 1,402, together with transfers of 126 from government and 12 from&#13;
1/ Throughout our SAM, no separate allowance has been made for&#13;
depreciation. Thus, 'gross profits' and 'undistributed profits' both&#13;
include depreciation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
abroad. Company income is shown as being paid out in column 4. Thus 98 is&#13;
paid to households as distributed profits, 959 to government in the form of&#13;
corporate taxes together with profits of government-owned enterprises, 220 is&#13;
paid as transfers abroad, and the remainder represents undistributed profits&#13;
after taxi/ of which 263 is transferred to the capital accounts as company&#13;
savings.&#13;
In a similar way, the government account (account 5) receives 352&#13;
from households in the form of direct taxes and social security payments, 959&#13;
from companies as corporate taxes and profits on government-owned corporate&#13;
enterprises, 248 as current transfers (non-factor income) from the Rest of the&#13;
World, and 1,549 from indirect taxes. The total receipts of 3,108 are&#13;
balanced by outgoings shown in the column for account 5. This includes&#13;
transfers of 171 to households, 126 to companies, 250 abroad, and 1,742 as&#13;
expenditure on commodities. The latter is government current expenditure.&#13;
The residual of 819 is government savings, and represents a current account&#13;
surplus by government.&#13;
The basic current/capital account balance of the economy can be seen&#13;
from the consolidated capital account in row and column 6. This account&#13;
receives (in the form of savings) 904 from households, 263 from companies, and&#13;
819 from government, giving a total supply of capital from domestic sources of&#13;
1,985. There is a negative item in the Rest of the World capital account&#13;
(column 8) indicating net capital outflows of 85. The row total of 1,900 is&#13;
then distributed in the column to purchase commodities for investment&#13;
(including increase in stocks) amounting to 2,015, and again a negative entry&#13;
1/ Includes depreciation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
in the Rest of the World capital account relates to net investment abroad of&#13;
115. A final check on the financing of investment is provided by the&#13;
following identity:&#13;
Investment minus savings   E  Net Foreign capital inflow&#13;
E   Balance of Payments&#13;
Current Account Deficit&#13;
or&#13;
2,015    -     1,985      30&#13;
The net foreign capital inflow thus derived is consistent with the&#13;
current account deficit in the Balance of Payments. Total receipts by the&#13;
Rest of the World on current account are 4,857 including receipts for imports&#13;
of 3,851 together with factor and transfer payments abroad totalling 1,006 (=&#13;
536 + 220 + 250). Against this, payments by the Rest of the World to factors,&#13;
transfers to companies and government, and exports all total 4,827. This&#13;
leaves a discrepancy of 30 which is the current account deficit, and is&#13;
therefore shown as a transfer from Rest of the World current account to the&#13;
Rest of the World capital account as 'foreign savings'.&#13;
The production activities are distinguished from the commodities Y&#13;
which they produce, in accordance with the Malaysian implementation of the SNA&#13;
and the commodity balances in particular. Column 10 shows that producing&#13;
activities pay out 9,038 in value added to factors, while paying out 7,889 as&#13;
intermediate purchases of commodities and 367 as taxes on value added. The&#13;
sum of these gives the total value of commodity production at factor cost&#13;
1/ 'Commodities' of course include both goods and services as in common usage&#13;
of the term in economics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
prices, that is, net of indirect taxes levied on the purchase of&#13;
commodities. This total of 17,294 constitutes the only incoming (row 10) from&#13;
sales by production activities, and is shown as a purchase by the commodities&#13;
account. The purchases of the commodities account (column 9) then consist of&#13;
these domestically produced commodities, valued at 17,294, plus imports of&#13;
3,851 at c.i.f. prices, together with all indirect taxes (net of subsidies) on&#13;
commodities (levied on domestic production plus imports) of 1,182. The gross&#13;
value of total commodity supply in purchasers' values is 22,327. Row 9 gives&#13;
the total receipt into this account arising from the sale of commodities,&#13;
valued at market prices, to other accounts. This gross value of supplies is&#13;
distributed as follows: 6,349 to the wants account (corresponding to&#13;
household consumption, 1,742 to government consumption, 2,015 to investment&#13;
(including increase in stocks and work in progress), 4,332 to exports, and&#13;
7,889 to activities as intermediate sales.&#13;
The final row of Table 2.1 shows the gross receipts of net indirect&#13;
taxes; 1,182 as commodity taxes and 367 as non-commodity indirect taxes levied&#13;
upon activities. In column 11 net indirect taxes of 1,549 are shown as&#13;
payments to government. The accounting structure of Table 2.1 is therefore&#13;
formally complete. The accounting balance is maintained, so that all of the&#13;
flows shown in the cells of the matrix preserve the accounting identities.&#13;
Two final points to note about the present SAM format refer to its&#13;
omissions as opposed to the actual content. Thus, as previously mentioned,&#13;
the domestic institutions' capital accounts are consolidated in our SAM and&#13;
show no detail other than the gross receipts and disbursements vis-A-vis other&#13;
accounts in the system. Had fuller details on capital transactions been&#13;
available, then the cell intersecting incomings and outgoings on capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
account (row and column 6) would have been a matrix of capital transfers&#13;
between institutions of the same order as the heavily boxed block of cells&#13;
representing current transfers. This matrix would then have indicated the&#13;
flow of funds in the system as a whole. As it is, with a consolidated capital&#13;
account, these transfers net out of the accounts since they constitute both an&#13;
incoming and an outgoing of the capital accounts. Accordingly, a zero entry&#13;
appears in the capital accounts diagonal cell. One consequence of this is&#13;
that the only diagonal entry appearing in the SAM is at the intersection of&#13;
account 3 for households. This is retained because several household accounts&#13;
are identified within our system and inter-household transactions are&#13;
estimated accordingly.&#13;
Finally, the estimation of wealth, and hence opening and closing&#13;
balances of assets,are completely omitted from the SAM. This is not because&#13;
of any conceptual problems, but simply because the data available, good though&#13;
it is in many respects, does not allow any significant progress on this front&#13;
at the present time.&#13;
2.2 National Accounting Aggregates in the SAM Context&#13;
The aggregate SAM shown in Table 2.1 is a convenient summary form for&#13;
showing the basic structure of the economy of Peninsular Malaysia in 1970. It&#13;
also serves as a useful summary of much of the detail that is pursued in later&#13;
chapters. However, it is convenient, as well as important, to demonstrate&#13;
that the social accounting matrix approach is not independent of the&#13;
conventions contained in the more traditional presentations of the national&#13;
accounts. Table 2.1 also provides a basis for reorganizing the various&#13;
estimates into a form which displays the national accounts in a useful summary&#13;
form.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Table 2.2 shows a sequence of condensed forms of Table 2.1. The&#13;
first panel of the table shows a simple aggregation of Table 2.1 according to&#13;
six of the seven broad groups of accounts referred to earlier. The only&#13;
difference is that the 'Wants' accounts have been subsumed within the&#13;
Production accounts, so that the fifth account includes the accounts of&#13;
Production Activities (account 10), Commodities (account 9), and Wants&#13;
(account 1). Otherwise the consolidation is undertaken according to the&#13;
structure referred to on page 2 of the previous section. The institutions'&#13;
accounts are therefore consolidated.!/ into single accounts for each of current&#13;
and capital transactions, and the accounts for the Rest of the World are also&#13;
combined. To facilitate comparison with Table 2.1, an asterisk (*) is entered&#13;
in those diagonal cells where previous entries have been netted out now that&#13;
certain accounts have been consolidated. For example, current transfers&#13;
between institutions now become zero. (If similar detail had been shown for&#13;
capital transfers between institutions (flow of funds) then an asterisk would&#13;
have been included in this first panel in the diagonal cell of the&#13;
institutions' capital accounts. Because no detail had previously been shown,&#13;
no asterisk appears.) Note also that row and column accounting balance is&#13;
maintained, and that row and column totals accord with those in Table 2.1,&#13;
except for items that have been netted out in the diagonals.&#13;

account. The effect of doing so is to show only a set of column entries for&#13;
the Rest of the World, which must sum to zero. Also, the accounts for the&#13;
Rest of the World are shown as the final column account 6, illustrating the&#13;
simple property of a SAM that the ordering of the accounts is quite arbitrary&#13;
and can therefore be chosen according to the informational requirements it is&#13;
intended to convey. In all respects other than the netting of transactions&#13;
with the Rest of the World, the second panel is exactly the same as the first.&#13;
The final panel has the same structure as the second. However, its&#13;
elements are schematic entries which identify the meaning of the corresponding&#13;
numerical entries which appear in the second panel. Factor income paid by the&#13;
production accounts and received by domestic factors, net of indirect taxes,&#13;
is Gross Domestic Product at factor cost (panel 3) and amounts to 9,038 (panel&#13;
2). Gross Domestic Product at factor cost plus net receipts of factor income&#13;
from abroad by domestic factors, gives Gross National Product at factor&#13;
cost. This is shown to amount to 8,722. Disposable national income at market&#13;
prices is shown as the sum of column/row 2. The balance of payments current&#13;
account deficit is shown as a positive entry at the intersection of row 5 and&#13;
column 6. It effectively shows a supplement to domestic savings required to&#13;
finance domestic investment.&#13;
The main purpose of the SAM framework as discussed in this study is&#13;
to attempt a disaggregation of the accounts we have summarized in Table 2.1,&#13;
that is, to work in the opposite direction of the consolidations portrayed in&#13;
Table 2.2. Nevertheless, the adaptability and relevance of the information&#13;
contained within the SAM is illustrated by the aggregations shown for&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia in Table 2.2. It can be noted that these all correspond&#13;
exactly with the aggregates shown in the National Accounts tables produced by&#13;

the Department of Statistics-I' Accordingly our subsequent disaggregations&#13;
are consistent with these aggregate figures and are constrained to them by&#13;
construction.&#13;
2.3 A Reader's Guide to the Detailed Accounts&#13;
The social accounting matrix which is shown in Table 2.1 results from&#13;
aggregations of more detailed estimates which are derived and discussed in&#13;
later chapters of this report. The broad classes of accounts can, in&#13;
principle, be disaggregated in a number of different ways, and we have already&#13;
alluded to the fact that the choice of disaggregation must depend both on its&#13;
analytical value and on the availability of data to sustain it. These&#13;
criteria and the classifications adopted in this exercise will be discussed in&#13;
the ensuing chapters. However, to give an initial impression of the orders of&#13;
magnitude of the resulting detail, this section briefly discusses the&#13;
structure of the accounts in disaggregated form and also provides references&#13;
to the parts of the report where further details can be found. In this&#13;
context it can be noted that the procedures for deriving cell estimates can be&#13;
quite complex in some instances and may involve interactions between accounts&#13;
in order that consistency constraints are satisfied. Given this, discussion&#13;
of certain parts of the SAM structure may involve cross-referencing to two or&#13;
more parts of the report.&#13;
At various points in the discussion it is necessary to refer to&#13;
component cells of Tables 1.1 and 2.1. With disaggregation these cells become&#13;
matrices, showing flows between the more detailed disaggregated accounts.&#13;
Thus there is a matrix corresponding to each element or cell of Tables 1.1 and&#13;
1/       See Malaysia, Department of Statistics (1975b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.1, and such matrices are denoted as Ti.j's in what follows. Table 2.3&#13;
reproduces Tables 1.1 and 2.1 using this Ti.j notation. The convention&#13;
adopted is that i refers to the row and j to the column in which a&#13;
particular Ti.j is situated. Since the i and the j will always relate&#13;
to the 11 x 11 aggregate SAM, it follows that we are potentially concerned&#13;
with 121 matrices   Ti.j  corresponding to   i,j = 1,2, .....,11. However, most&#13;
of these matrices are empty and Table 2.3 sets out the SAM in this symbolic&#13;
form showing only those Tij's which are not empty and therefore need to be&#13;
estimated. To give an example of the way Table 2.3 should be read, the&#13;
matrix T2.10 relates to value added payments from production activities to&#13;
factors (Table 1.1): and the total value of all elements in this matrix for&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia in 1970 was 9,038 (Table 2.1). More generally, each of&#13;
the non-zero symbolic matrices in Table 2.3 is identified in the footnote to&#13;
the table by reference to its description as in Table 1.1.&#13;
Although the elements Ti.j potentially represent submatrices, they&#13;
may degenerate into vectors or even scalars if the accounts in question are&#13;
not disaggregated further. The dimensions of the full matrix, and hence of&#13;
the component submatrices, are indicated in Table 2.4 which shows the number&#13;
of accounts into which each of the eleven classes of accounts is disaggregated&#13;
for subsequent analysis.&#13;
A second purpose of Table 2.4 is to indicate to the reader where&#13;
detail on any part of the SAM for Peninsular Malaysia can be found. The&#13;
references in the cells of Table 2.4 are to the numbered tables to be found in&#13;
later chapters. Every Ti.j is referred to in at least one of these ensuing&#13;
tables, while the supporting text discusses the detailed methodology of the&#13;

estimation procedures.   Accordingly Table 2.4 provides a condensed 'reader's&#13;
guide' to the subsequent text.&#13;
In the text which follows, chapters are arranged so as to highlight&#13;
the principal directions -- initially independent, but subsequently&#13;
interdependent -- in which the compilation of a 1970 SAM for Peninsular&#13;
Malaysia has proceeded. As already outlined in Section 1.3, the two principal&#13;
directions for compiling the accounts have been via the Household accounts&#13;
(using the Household Expenditure Survey data) and the Production accounts&#13;
(based upon the published Input-Output tables). These two avenues are&#13;
considered in Chapters 3 and 4. The Factor accounts provide an implicit link&#13;
between the Household and Production accounts, and their consistency from the&#13;
two sources is considered in Chapter 5. Meanwhile, the rationale for adopting&#13;
certain classifications of factors and households is also discussed in&#13;
Chapter 3.&#13;
Chapter 6 accumulates all of the sources and methods for compiling&#13;
the remaining and more aggregative accounts of the system. These include&#13;
institutions' current accounts other than households. No disaggregation of&#13;
the corporate enterprises has been achieved, and the government accounts are&#13;
also consolidated so that there are no separate accounts for federal, state or&#13;
statutory bodies. In many ways, a failure to show disaggregations of these&#13;
'other' institutional accounts, is something that can hopefully be rectified&#13;
in the near future. Statistics subsequently processed in the National&#13;
Accounts Division in the Malaysian Department of Statistics ought to readily&#13;
afford a disaggregation of the accounts of certain government bodies, on both&#13;
the expenditure and the revenue sides. At the time the study was undertaken,&#13;
such disaggregations were simply not possible. Similarly, some early&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
aspirations fo,r disaggregating the current accounts of the corporate sector&#13;
have not materialized in empirical results which can be presented here.&#13;
2.4 Condensed Results of the Detailed Accounting for Peninsular Malaysia&#13;
The first column of Table 2.4 has indicated the number of accounts&#13;
that are to be separately distinguished within each of the eleven main classes&#13;
of account. In total these amount to 212, although it should be noted that&#13;
disaggregation has been confined to five of the eleven classes, namely, Wants&#13;
(account 1); Factors (account 2); Households (account 3); Commodities (account&#13;
9); and Activities (account 10).1&#13;
A fully disaggregated SAM, involving a matrix with 212 rows and&#13;
columns, can be assembled from the component submatrices Ti.j as recorded in&#13;
various tables in later chapters. This is apparent from Table 2.4 which shows&#13;
where in the text the relevant details are to be found. However, this is not&#13;
an exercise which we have entertained since the size of page required for such&#13;
a table would be quite overwhelming. Nor would the exercise prove to be&#13;
especially useful in developing an understanding of the dimensions or even the&#13;
structure of the detailed SAM. Rather, it is anticipated that the reader will&#13;
have no difficulty in visualizing this large tableau and that, with the aid of&#13;
Tables 2.5 to 2.10 which follow, the process of reducing it to the simple&#13;
national accounts aggregates in Table 2.2 can be appreciated on the basis of&#13;
some general comment which now follows.&#13;
1/   In Chapter 8, accounts 7 and 8 (the current and capital accounts of the&#13;
Rest of the World) are also disaggregated to show separately transactions&#13;
between Peninsular Malaysia and the East Malaysia states of Sabah and&#13;
Sarawak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Reference has been made earlier in this chapter to the operation of&#13;
consolidating two or more accounts within a SAM framework. This is the most&#13;
important of the basic operations which can be imposed on a SAM, and involves&#13;
three steps. First, the rows corresponding to the accounts to be consolidated&#13;
are aggregated; and the results obtained are presented as a new row of the SAM&#13;
corresponding to the consolidated account. Next, the corresponding columns&#13;
are treated analogously. And finally, the element of the resulting SAM which&#13;
lies at the intersection of the newly formed row and column for the&#13;
consolidated account is set equal to zero. This is the substance of the&#13;
process. Essentially it involves aggregation of a set of accounts by summing&#13;
their incomes and outlays. The only novelty is in the third step whereby the&#13;
diagonal entry in the newly formed account is set equal to zero. Since this&#13;
is a diagonal entry, changing its value does not upset the row and column&#13;
balance of the SAM. And, again because it is a diagonal, a non-zero entry&#13;
measures transfer payments within the (consolidated) account in which it is&#13;
located. Thus setting a diagonal entry to zero corresponds to the elimination&#13;
of a particular type of transfer payment l&#13;
It is immediately obvious that in the process of consolidation, the&#13;
order of the first two steps is reversible. Thus in going from the implicit&#13;
tableau of 212 rows and columns of our SAM to the aggregate SAM of eleven rows&#13;
and columns in Table 2.1, we can start by combining either rows or columns.&#13;
If we start with columns, then the result is a 212 by 11 matrix which shows&#13;
the incomings of each of the detailed 212 accounts from each of the 11&#13;
1/   For further discussion, see Chapter 8 of J.R.N. Stone, Input-Output and&#13;

aggregate accounts. Such details are recorded as the incomes of accounts in&#13;
Tables 2.5 to 2.10. Only non-zero entries are recorded here and the 212 by 11&#13;
matrix is presented as partitions. Thus Table 2.5 records incomings of Wants&#13;
which constitute the first 59 accounts. Then Table 2.6 shows similar details&#13;
for the 51 Factor accounts; and so on for Households (Table 2.7), Commodities&#13;
(Table 2.8), and Activities (Table 2.9). As can be seen from Table 2.4, these&#13;
details cover those five of the eleven aggregate accounts which are&#13;
disaggregated in our analysis. Incomings of the remaining six accounts are&#13;
given in Table 2.10 to complete the detail. A final point to note is that in&#13;
the Tables 2.5 to 2.9, incomings from one of the eleven aggregate accounts&#13;
must represent the row sums of a Ti ; matrix as defined in Table 2.3. The&#13;
vector of such matrix row sums can be denoted by Ti.ji, where the vector&#13;
i is defined to have all elements equal to unity. This notation is used to&#13;
designate the separate entries for incomes of different types in Tables 2.5 to&#13;
2.9.&#13;
Summing the 212 by 11 matrix across columns yields total incomes for&#13;
each of the 212 accounts. These totals are also shown in Tables 2.5 to&#13;
2.10. And because the 212 by 212 matrix is a SAM, corresponding row and&#13;
column totals must be equal. Thus total incomes and total outlays must be&#13;
equal.&#13;
A decomposition of total outlays is also provided in Tables 2.5 to&#13;
2.10. These details can be arrived at by starting the aggregation of the 212&#13;
by 212 SAM by columns rather than rows. Thus to obtain the details for&#13;
outlays in Tables 2.5 to 2.10, the first step is to aggregate rows of the 212&#13;
by 212 tableau so as to obtain an 11 by 212 matrix. This matrix can then be&#13;
transposed to obtain outlay details on a 212 by 11 basis as shown in the&#13;
&#13;

tables. Non-zero entries now correspond to column sums of the Ti j&#13;
matrices, i.e. to expressions of the form i'Ti. . Through transposition,&#13;
these take the form T'i.ji as set out in Tables 2.5 to 2.9.&#13;
Tables 2.5 to 2.9 show the incomes and outlays of each of the 212&#13;
accounts in summary form and provided a convenient means of presenting the row&#13;
and column sums of matrices Ti.j which are to be derived in detail in&#13;
subsequent chapters. Either the income or the outlay presentation is an&#13;
initial step to aggregating our implicit 212 by 212 SAM into the 11 by 11 by&#13;
version shown as Table 2.1. Thus the incomes correspond to a 212 by 11&#13;
aggregation while the outlays represent an 11 by 212 aggregation. From either&#13;
starting point the 11 by 11 aggregate SAM can be obtained.&#13;
To go from the aggregate SAM to the national accounts in Table 2.1&#13;
requires first that diagonal elements of the former be set equal to zero.&#13;
Thus consolidation from a 212 by 212 to an 11 by 11 presentation is&#13;
completed. Further consolidation then reduces this table to a 6 by 6 format&#13;
as discussed in Section 2.2 above. This achieved, it remains only to present&#13;
the Rest of the World account on a net basis to obtain the national accounts&#13;
detail of Table 2.2.&#13;
Tables 2.5 to 2.9 introduce the disaggregations which are discussed&#13;
in subsequent chapters. In particular, the choice of classifications for&#13;
these disaggregations is debated as various points in Chapters 3 to 5. Our&#13;
starting point is with the disaggregation of the household sector accounts,&#13;
and it is to this that we now turn since it provides the focal point of the&#13;
present study.&#13;

CHAPTER 3&#13;
HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND OUTLAY ACCOUNTS&#13;
3.1 Introduction&#13;
As discussed in the previous chapter, one of our main concerns in&#13;
moving forward from the aggregate SAM shown as Table 2.1 towards a more&#13;
detailed data schema is to provide a quantitative picture of income&#13;
differentials among different types of households. Such a picture records the&#13;
distribution of income. It is therefore a partial answer to the important&#13;
question: "Who gets what out of the national product?'Vl/&#13;
To distinguish the incomes of different household groups within a SAM&#13;
clearly requires disaggregation of the household sector into different&#13;
household types. Table 2.7 has already recorded the fact that, within the&#13;
resident population, 32 different household types are distinguished in our&#13;
analysis. It remains then to discuss the choice of disaggregation criteria&#13;
which are involved. As a preliminary to this, there are some general issues&#13;
which it is useful to rehearse 2/&#13;
In the first instance, the concern of development policy is with the&#13;
standard of living of individuals, not with households or household groups. A&#13;
1/ Since the disposal of domestic product is partly at the discretion of&#13;
companies and government as well as households, the "who gets what?"&#13;
question is only partly answered by the details of income distribution&#13;
among households. The distribution of disposable income between House-&#13;
holds (in aggregate), Companies and Government is also a critical aspect&#13;
of income distribution. See Pyatt (1977) for further development of this&#13;
argument.&#13;
2/ The following discussion draws substantially on Pyatt and Thorbecke&#13;
(1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
conceptual possibility, therefore, would be to disaggregate the domestic (i.e.&#13;
household) sector of the economy into individual as opposed to household&#13;
types. In practice there are good reasons for not adopting such an&#13;
approach. On the outlay side of the accounts, for many purposes the household&#13;
acts as a collective spending unit, making essentially common provision for&#13;
such basic items as food and shelter. More generally, within the household,&#13;
the principle: "to each according to their needs", may have some proximate&#13;
validity, so that living standards of individuals may be assumed to be roughly&#13;
equal. And even if such a view is contentious (e.g. in terms of the&#13;
respective living standards of men, women and children) there is little that&#13;
can be done about it in practice since available data on expenditures treat&#13;
the household as the primary unit. On the income side of the accounts, the&#13;
situation is only partly different. Wage and salary payments typically accrue&#13;
to individuals and can be recorded as such. But many households are engaged&#13;
in domestic or unincorporated business enterprises. The tenant farmer may be&#13;
individually responsible for his rental, but it is likely that several family&#13;
members will be engaged in the farm work. Accordingly, the net income of the&#13;
farm may be difficult to allocate among the individuals who produced it.&#13;
These arguments imply that for practical purposes the household has&#13;
to be the basic unit in the domestic sector. However, incomes have an&#13;
important individual element so that the composition of a household in terms&#13;
of individuals with different skills is a potentially important determinant of&#13;
its general living standard. Equally, the household's endowment with assets,&#13;
such as land, will also be of major importance. It follows that one dimension&#13;
in which criteria for classifying households might be found is in terms of the&#13;
factors of production with which they are endowed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
It also follows from these arguments that the criteria for grouping&#13;
households cannot be considered independently of the criteria used to&#13;
distinguish different factors of production: the two dimensions are&#13;
interrelated and come together in our SAM as determinants of the sub-matrix&#13;
T3.2 in which incomes of the different factors are paid out to each of the&#13;
separately distinguished household types.&#13;
The linkage between household types and factor classifications is&#13;
important if we are to look behind the immediate quantitative answer to: "who&#13;
gets what?" Since a further criterion for household groupings might be&#13;
differences in their savings/consumption behaviour, it follows that&#13;
redistribution of income between groups of households will change the observed&#13;
aggregate expenditure patterns. It then follows that changes in income&#13;
distribution will alter production patterns since the latter are determined in&#13;
part by demand. However, if we are interested in the causes underlying the&#13;
distribution of income, it must be recognized that the effects of income&#13;
distribution on production structure are only part of the story. A change in&#13;
production structure implies changes in the demand for factors of&#13;
production. Hence changes in incomes of the factors can be expected as a&#13;
consequence. And since factor incomes are a major determinant of household&#13;
incomes, it follows that not only does income distribution affect production&#13;
structure, but production structure will be a major element in determining&#13;
income distribution.&#13;
This two-way interdependence of income distribution and production&#13;
structure is the basis of most recent modeling efforts to understand income&#13;
distribution as an integral part of the development process. One of our main&#13;
concerns in developing a SAM for Malaysia is to serve such modeling work. And&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
here it is worth noting that the sense in which this two-way interdependency&#13;
can be captured must obviously depend on the way in which households, factors&#13;
and production activities are classified: some classification schemes will&#13;
capture more of the essential processes than others.&#13;
In these terms, the grouping of households by income levels is not&#13;
obviously the most attractive approach. It is clearly the most informative&#13;
approach if the only issue is to describe income distribution at a point in&#13;
time. But if the purpose of description is to provide a basis for diagnosis&#13;
and policy change, then the grouping criteria should correspond to&#13;
constituencies which can be influenced differentially by policy means.&#13;
Deciles of the household income distribution are virtually impossible to&#13;
legislate for as such. There is limited value, therefore, in a data framework&#13;
which groups households according to an income criterion ./&#13;
Against this background our chosen criteria for grouping households&#13;
are location, race and employment status with the following disaggrrgations&#13;
according to each criterion:&#13;
Location              Race               Employment Status&#13;
FUrban1              Malay                Employer&#13;
Rural]     x        Chinese     x       Employee&#13;
Indian              Own Account Worker&#13;
Other               Other&#13;
2                    4                        4&#13;
1/ An earlier study of Sri Lanka (see Pyatt and Roe with Lindley, Round and&#13;
others (1977)) classified households by (i) income level; and (ii)&#13;
geographical location. In moving from SAM compilation to economic&#13;
analysis, the limited value of the income dimension of the classification&#13;
became readily apparent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Thus our analysis distinguishes a total of 32 household types at this stage.&#13;
Similarly, labor is to be disaggregated into 48 different types according to&#13;
the criteria location, race and educational level with the following details&#13;
within each:&#13;
Location               Race                 Education&#13;
fUrba                 Malay                 None&#13;
pRual]  x         Chinese      x        Some Primary&#13;
Indian               Complete Primary&#13;
Other                Lower Secondary&#13;
Some Upper Secondary&#13;
HSC or higher&#13;
2                     4                         6&#13;
It follows that our disaggregations of households and labor are the same with&#13;
respect to location and race. They differ in recognizing employment status of&#13;
the principal earner as a criterion for further disaggregation of households,&#13;
while education level complements location and race as a disaggregation&#13;
criterion for distinguishing individuals as a factor of production.&#13;
The locational criterion for disaggregation is useful because the&#13;
urban/rural distinction captures many aspects of duality. Depending on this&#13;
distinction, individuals with otherwise similar characteristics are quite&#13;
likely to be paid different wages, have different job opportunities and&#13;
employment expectations, and generally to be subject to different sets of&#13;
parameters in their socio-economic behaviour. In much the same way, for&#13;
Malaysia it was considered important to distinguish four ethnic groups&#13;
throughout the factor and household analyses. This is because the&#13;
government's general economic development strategy includes specific concern&#13;
for the distribution of employment opportunities, income and wealth between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
the various ethnic groups.!/ Accordingly, in our classification scheme, the&#13;
three principal ethnic groups of Malay, Chinese and Indian population members&#13;
are supplemented by a group comprising all other races. This latter category&#13;
raises some serious problems of sample size in analyzing househld survey data,&#13;
especially since 'Others' are only about one percent of the Peninsular&#13;
Malaysian Population. Accordingly, results for this group are subject to&#13;
rather wide margins of error, which is the price for obtaining distinct&#13;
figures for the three major racial groups. However, the combined location and&#13;
race dimensions are important not only from the viewpoint of monitoring&#13;
policies through their distributive effects, but also because they correspond&#13;
to behavioural differences within the Malaysian economy, not least with&#13;
respect to savings.&#13;
Further behavioural differences are captured by using normal&#13;
employment status of the principal earner as a third criterion for&#13;
disaggregating households. For this purpose four employment status codes were&#13;
used: Employer, Employee, Own Account Worker, and Other (which comprises&#13;
students, housewives, retired persons, etc.). This classification goes some&#13;
way towards capturing differences in life style and assets among household&#13;
types which have quite different relationships with factor markets according&#13;
to this criterion.&#13;
The education dimension which complements location and race in&#13;
defining labor types turns out to be important in explaining income&#13;
differences. Ideally each type of labor ought to be defined so that it can be&#13;
viewed as providing a homogeneous factor service irrespective of the&#13;
1/ See, for example, Government of Malaysia (1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
production activity in which it is employed. Adding education level to the&#13;
list of criteria for defining labor types goes a good way towards reaching&#13;
this ideal.&#13;
Of course, payments for labor services are not the only type of&#13;
income which households receive. Owner occupiers receive imputed rent on&#13;
their houses as well as actual rental income.1/ Additionally, current&#13;
transfer incomes are important both for the richer households which receive&#13;
interest and dividends on their financial assets, and for the poorer&#13;
households which may be largely dependent on remittances. The employment&#13;
status dimension of the household classification potentially captures some of&#13;
this variety. Similarly, income from unincorporated business enterprises&#13;
tends to be concentrated in employer and own account households. In Chapter 4&#13;
an attempt is made to split this income into a profit component and a part&#13;
which can be treated as an imputed wage. This is one of the most difficult&#13;
parts of our exercise but also most useful in attempting to understand the&#13;
sources of income inequality.&#13;
Before coming to this discussion of factor accounts in Chapter 4, the&#13;
present chapter focuses on results for household incomes and outlays. The&#13;
starting point is data from a household survey and is discussed in the next&#13;
section, Section 3.2. These data are then modified in Section 3.3 to obtain&#13;
results which are consistent with the 1970 National Accounts. Then Section&#13;
3.4 attempts further refinement of the results obtained up to this point.&#13;
This has three aspects. One is to provide a revised set of savings and&#13;
consumption estimates so that the implied savings behavior is consistent not&#13;

only with known facts about household savings but also with prior judgements&#13;
about differences in savings behavior between household types. Secondly, the&#13;
total consumption estimates by household type are disaggregated to give&#13;
details of expenditure on each want, i.e. the matrix T1.3 of our SAM. And&#13;
finally, an attempt is made to estimate in detail the current transfers&#13;
between institutions recorded in matrices T3.3 , T3.4 and T3.5 .&#13;
Accordingly, the material in this chapter takes us from the aggregate SAM&#13;
shown as Table 2.1 to a new SAM, Table 3.11, in which details are given for&#13;
each of 32 different household types within the domestic sector of Peninsular&#13;
Malaysia.&#13;
3.2 Incomes and Outlays in the 1973 Household Expenditure Survey&#13;
The 1973 Household Expenditure Survey (HES) conducted by the&#13;
Department of Statistics, Government of Malaysia j/ provides a rich source of&#13;
information on the incomes and outlays of households. Table 3.1 sets out our&#13;
initial tabulations from this survey for each of the 32 household types&#13;
separately defined in the previous section.&#13;
In considering the results in Table 3.1 certain points about the HES&#13;
should be borne in mind. First, the HES is a monthly survey of some 7,273&#13;
households and, as such, is subject to sampling errors and potential bias !&#13;
Secondly, the same sample of households has been used as a basis for a labor&#13;
1/ See Malaysia, Department of Statistics (unpublished).&#13;
2/ The survey design involved 1/12th of the households being surveyed each&#13;
month over a period of a year. For expenditure information, the&#13;
households were visited on alternate days. Income information was&#13;
collected once for HES.&#13;

force survey and also for an annual income survey (the HIS). 1/ Only limited&#13;
tabulations were available from the latter at the time this study was&#13;
undertaken. However, an initial comparison in Table 3.2 suggests that the two&#13;
sets of data are close and that the income differentials observed in HES with&#13;
respect to location and race are maintained in the HIS enquiry. This, in&#13;
conjunction with the obviously careful design of the survey, gives some&#13;
confidence for proceeding with the HES results as set out in Table 3.1. Table&#13;
3.3 summarizes these results which show rankings of income levels which&#13;
confirm a priori expectations. Urban incomes are invariably higher than&#13;
corresponding rural incomes and, in general, Chinese households have higher&#13;
income levels than Indian households who, in turn, are better. off than&#13;
Malays. With respect to employment status, Employee households are invariably&#13;
richer than the corresponding households of Own Account workers, and Employer&#13;
households tend to be more affluent than either of these. However, it should&#13;
be noted that the small sample sizes of some of the household categories&#13;
suggest that wide margins of error might exist in the figures relating to&#13;
them. Those estimates in Table 3.3 which are based on a sample of less than&#13;
36 (five percent of the total sample) are shown in parentheses to indicate&#13;
their relative uncertainty on this account.&#13;
Table 3.3 reproduces the savings estimates.2/ from Table 3.1 which&#13;
are derived as a residual to balance total incomes and outlays. The incidence&#13;
of negative figures in the relevant column is not surprising in comparison&#13;
with household survey results elsewhere in the world. But it does suggest&#13;

World Fertility Survey.&#13;
2/ Defined to include contributions to the employees provident fund at this&#13;
stage in the analysis. Subsequently we adopt the national accounts&#13;

hence as a current transfer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

that there is a potential bias toward under-recording of incomes relative to&#13;
expenditures. And in this context it can be noted that adoption of the HIS&#13;
figures in Table 3.2 would make this problem worse rather than better: HIS&#13;
gives higher income figures only for urban Chinese and Indian households who&#13;
already have positive savings in Table 3.1.&#13;
In deriving the other details of Table 3.1 the following definitions&#13;
have been used (based on the HES coding):&#13;
Wages: includes income in kind and employer's contributions to provident&#13;
funds.&#13;
Unincorporated business income: this is defined to correspond as closely&#13;
as possible to that part of gross value added by household and unincorporated&#13;
business activities which accrues to the household, i.e. wage payments to non-&#13;
household members are excluded.&#13;
Rent: both cash receipts and imputed rent are included.&#13;
Transfer income: this figure covers non-factor income from all domestic&#13;
sources, i,e. from companies (dividends), from government, and from other&#13;
households.&#13;
Consumption: includess an imputed value for consumption of goods produced&#13;
by the household.&#13;
Social Security: the value of both employer's and employee's&#13;
contributions to provident funds.&#13;
Most of these figures correspond to an aggregate which is published as part of&#13;
the Malaysian National Accounts. Accordingly, further checks can be made on&#13;
their consistency as part of a process of reconciliation between the two data&#13;
sources. This is discussed in the next section.&#13;

3.3 Reconciliation of HES Results with the National Accounts&#13;
The fact that 13 of the 32 household types are shown in Table 3.1 to&#13;
have negative savings rates has already been noted, and it has been suggested&#13;
that this reflects a bias towards under-recording of incomes relative to&#13;
expenditures. A second set of evidence which points to under-recording of&#13;
incomes can be found in the comparison of aggregates for all households in&#13;
Table 3.1 (which refers to 1973), with corresponding estimates (for 1970) from&#13;
the National Accounts. The relevant data for consumption and the total of&#13;
wages plus unincorporated business income are set out in Table 3.4.&#13;
Table 3.4:   SCALING FACTORS FOR COMPARISON OF HES AND&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

These figures can be reconciled with the figures shown in the aggregate SAM&#13;
(Table 2.1) as follows:&#13;
Consumption (Table 2.1)                      6,349.2&#13;
less consumption by&#13;
permanent non-residents                 -      16.0&#13;
Table 3.4 consumption figure                 6,333.2&#13;
Factor incomes paid to&#13;
households (Table 2.1)                     7,319.7&#13;
less ownership of dwellings               -    662.9&#13;
Table 3.4 Wages + unincorporated&#13;
business income                            6,656.8&#13;
The figures show that to obtain the National Accounts control figure for&#13;
consumption in Table 3.4, HES data need to be inflated by a factor of 2.826&#13;
(x 103) while a higher inflation factor is needed for factor incomes, viz.&#13;
3.007.&#13;
This relatively minor difference in the required adjustment factors&#13;
could be due to different economic conditions prevailing in 1970 from those in&#13;
1973; to biases in the National Accounts data; or to biases in the HES&#13;
income/expenditure data. Recognizing these possibilities, the principle&#13;
adopted is to maintain the National Accounts data as control totals and to&#13;
anticipate that observed dissavings in survey data are partially attributable&#13;
to relative downward bias in recorded incomes. For these reasons, the upward&#13;
scaling of the HES estimates in Table 3.1 to match National Accounts control&#13;
totals is achieved by applying a different scaling factor to each column of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
Table 3.1. The relevant control totals and the scaling factors are shown in&#13;
the last two rows of that table. These need further explanation.&#13;
In most instances the sources for control data and corresponding&#13;
adjustment factors is straightforward. For rent, the National Accounts figure&#13;
for ownership of dwellings is used as the control; for consumption, the&#13;
control total has already been referred to in Table 3.4; and for transfers to&#13;
Government (taxes) and Social Security payments, independent figures are&#13;
available from the National Accounts. This, then, leaves outstanding problems&#13;
for the treatment of transfer receipts and payments to other households, and&#13;
various components of factoral income.&#13;
Table 3.1 shows quite clearly that transfer receipts are an important&#13;
source of income for some household types, especially those whose main earner&#13;
has the occupational status 'other'. As previously noted, this category of&#13;
households is a miscellaneous group comprising those households in which the&#13;
principal income recipient is not an employer, employee or own account&#13;
worker. It is to be expected, therefore, that non-factor income will dominate&#13;
in this group, which is one reason for distinguishing them separately. Table&#13;
3.1 tends to confirm this expectation.-&#13;
Total household transfers to other households are shown by the HES as&#13;
being 133.1, while household transfer receipts from all sources are 222.3. It&#13;
follows that the difference, 89.2, can be taken as an HES estimate of&#13;
household transfer receipts from companies and government. This last figure&#13;
1/ The main exception is with respect to the household group "Urban-Other-&#13;
Other" which emerges in the final analysis as having substantial&#13;
dissavings. This may reflect the fact that such households are&#13;
predominantly retired and living off wealth. Or it may be that their&#13;
transfer income is seriously underestimated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
can be compared with a National Accounts figure of 269.3, implying an&#13;
adjustment factor of 3.019. This is a similar ratio to the others recorded in&#13;
Table 3.1 and has been adopted as the adjustment factor for all transfer&#13;
receipts and expenditures, except for transfers from households to Government&#13;
for which a separate control is available.&#13;
In determining scaling coefficients for the two types of factor&#13;
incomes, viz. wages and income from unincorporated business, two&#13;
considerations have been taken into account. One is the expectation that&#13;
unincorporated business income may be under-recorded relative to wages. The&#13;
second is the general concern to eliminate negative savings from the figures&#13;
on the ground that, for most household groups, savings are unlikely to be&#13;
negative except perhaps in the short term. Both considerations lead to the&#13;
choice of 2.913 as the scaling factor for wages and 3.208 as the corresponding&#13;
figure for unincorporated business income. These figures are consistent with&#13;
the general scaling coefficient of 3.007 for factor incomes, previously&#13;
indicated in Table 3.4, and have been chosen because they imply that savings&#13;
other than social security contributions are non-negative for all groups&#13;
(apart from the maverick, and small sample, group Urban-Other-Other).&#13;
Accordingly, the figures have the status of convenient 'guesstimates' and&#13;
otherwise are hard to justify. However, apart from their consistency with&#13;
National Accounts, they may be considered'reasonable in their implication that&#13;
wages are underrecorded in HES by about 3.5 percent relative to consumption,&#13;
while the corresponding figure for unincorporated business income is just&#13;
under 12 percent.&#13;
Table 3.5 gives the household income and outlay accounts which result&#13;
from scaling Table 3.1 for consistency with the National Accounts as described&#13;

above. With respect to incomes, these are the final figures which enter into&#13;
our SAM accounts but they are subject to further disaggregation as discussed&#13;
in the next section.&#13;
Table 3.6 sets out some implications of the income figures in Table&#13;
3.5. These show that Rural Malay Own Account households are the poorest of&#13;
the numerically significant groups. More generally, the data retain the main&#13;
characteristics of income relativities observed in the Table 3.1 calculations&#13;
taken directly from the HES: urban households are invariably better off than&#13;
rural households with the same characteristics; in general the ranking by&#13;
characteristic of principal earner favors employer households over employee&#13;
households' and the latter are always more affluent than households where the&#13;
principal earner is an own account worker; and the general tendency is for&#13;
Chinese to have the highest incomes, ceteris paribus, while Indians are&#13;
usually better off than Malays.&#13;
3.4 Further Refinement of the Outlay Accounts&#13;
While the total income figures in Table 3.5 are not subject to&#13;
further revision, the details on the outlay or expenditure side have been&#13;
subject to one further stage of adjustment and some additional&#13;
amplifications. The adjustment relates to savings. Up to this point the&#13;
figures shown in Table 3.5 have the status of being balancing residuals, even&#13;
though some of the procedures used to derive the table reflect a concern to&#13;
eliminate negative savings estimates in the original data. As a further step,&#13;

therefore, the savings figures have been smoothedi/ to reflect the prior&#13;
judgements that, ceteris paribus, the ratio of savings (excluding social&#13;
security payments) to income (also excluding social security payments and&#13;
transfers to Government)&#13;
(i) increases with respect to income;&#13;
(ii)  is higher for urban than for rural households;&#13;
(iii)  is higher for Chinese households than for Indian;&#13;
and for Indian compared with Malay; and&#13;
(iv)  is higher for Employer households than Own Account;&#13;
and for Own Account relative to Employee households.&#13;
These prior judgements may be debatable. However, they are a&#13;
synthesis of discussions on the initial estimates shown in Table 3.5 and&#13;
therefore reflect subjective judgements derived from familiarity with other&#13;
data sources, and general knowledge of the economy. It follows that the&#13;
revised outlay accounts they give rise to may or may not be accepted as an&#13;
improvement over the figures in Table 3.5. In any event the revisions do not&#13;
affect the column totals of that table, nor do they affect the estimated&#13;
composition of transfer payments and social security contributions. Since the&#13;
income figures are also taken as given, the only adjustments are to the&#13;
composition of household savings, with corresponding adjustments to the&#13;
consumption data to retain the given income aggregates by household type, and&#13;
the given aggregates over all households of total savings and consumption.&#13;
1/ A linear programming method was used so that prior judgements on the&#13;
figures in Table 3.5 and the general considerations listed below were&#13;
expressed as inequalities. Subject to these, the largest adjustment&#13;
necessary to satisfy the inequalities was minimized.&#13;

The results of this set of adjustments are set out in Table 3.7 which&#13;
shows the savings ratios for each type of household which have been finally&#13;
adopted. The figures naturally reflect the prior judgements that have been&#13;
built into their derivation as discussed above. Additionally, savings ratios&#13;
for the categories 'Other' have been derived by interpolation from the results&#13;
for other categories. Hence the figures show a pattern of savings rates&#13;
rising with income; a higher level of savings among urban households; and a&#13;
general tendency for Chinese to save more than Indians who in turn tend to&#13;
save more than Malays.&#13;
While these aspects of the savings pattern are built into the&#13;
estimates, the linear programming method usedl- still allowed considerable&#13;
flexibility. Two characteristics of the results which were not imposed are&#13;
therefore of interest. The first is that the effect of being an urban&#13;
household gives a premium to the savings rate (of about 5.5 percent) which is&#13;
independent of income level. The second is that in the empirical results&#13;
Employer households have the same savings function as Own Account households,&#13;
i.e. the graph of their savings rate versus income is the same. But of&#13;
course, employer households tend to have higher incomes and to that extent&#13;
have higher savings ratios. This can be seen from Figure 3.1 which shows the&#13;
estimated savings rate for the sixteen household types which entered the&#13;
primary analysis, i.e. excluding the racial and occupation status categories&#13;
'Other'.&#13;

The implications of these savings rates and the consequent&#13;
adjustments to consumption estimates are shown in Table 3.8 which records the&#13;
outlay accounts for households in our SAM. This table shows 33 household&#13;
types rather than the 32 types discussed so far. The additional category&#13;
refers to permanent non-residents (e.g. embassy staff) who need special&#13;
treatment as a household type in our schema to allow for a discrepancy which&#13;
would otherwise exist between the treatment of the household sector in the&#13;
National Income Accounts and the Malaysian input-output tables 1/&#13;
In Table 3.8, household transfers to other households are shown in&#13;
aggregate only, as is consumption expenditure. However, our full SAM schema&#13;
requires that these details should be available as matrices: T3.3 shows the&#13;
pattern of transfers among household types; T3.4 shows household transfer&#13;
receipts from companies; T3.5 shows similar transfer receipts from&#13;
government; while T1.3 shows the breakdown of consumption into expenditure&#13;
on Wants, i.e. expenditure on each of the 33 different consumer commodity&#13;
groups distinguished in the full SAM.&#13;
The HES has been our starting point for deriving all these&#13;
matrices.  With respect to   T1.3  the analysis is quite simple.   Total&#13;
consumption by each household type is given in Table 3.8 while total&#13;
expenditure on each want is a known vector, obtained as part of our commodity&#13;
balance accounts as discussed in Chapter 5. Hence row and column totals of&#13;
T1.3 are known. Furthermore, an initial estimate of the matrix T1.3 is&#13;
available directly from tabulations of the HES. Accordingly our procedure has&#13;
been to take this initial estimate and adjust it to satisfy the required row&#13;
1/ See p. 69 and also Malaysia, Department of Statistics (1975c).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
and column totals. For this purpose the RAS adjustment has been used.! This&#13;
yields the results for consumption patterns by household type shown in&#13;
Table 3.9 (see p.297) which is our estimate of the SAM submatrix    T1.3&#13;
Table 3.9 shows the full detail of consumption patterns by household&#13;
type and hence is a basis for analyzing how these consumption patterns differ&#13;
across the household groupings. Column totals of the table show total&#13;
consumption expenditure for each group of households and hence reproduce the&#13;
figures previously given in Table 3.8.&#13;
At this point, to complete the estimation of household outlay&#13;
accounts requires the estimation of matrices T3.3 , T3.4 and T3.5 . This&#13;
presents some considerable difficulties but has been attempted for the sake of&#13;
completeness. The matrices record part of current transfers between&#13;
institutions, and, to the extent that these are not a numerically important&#13;
part of the SAM, the fact that the estimates are crudely based is not a cause&#13;
for concern.&#13;
The upper panel of Table 3.10 gives basic information, taken from the&#13;
HES, on the transfer receipts of households and transfer payments by them to&#13;
other households. In deriving the table, it is assumed that transfer payments&#13;
by each household type are received by households of the same ethnic&#13;
characteristic. This assumption is retained throughout the analysis. The&#13;
lower panel of Table 3.10 adjusts the HES data to national account controls&#13;
and to the previously derived estimates of total transfer receipts by&#13;
household type (Table 3.5) and transfer payments to other households (Table&#13;
1/ For details of the RAS method see the Technical Appendix. A full&#13;
treatment is available in Cambridge, Department of Applied Economics&#13;
(1962-), especially Volume 3, and Bacharach (1970).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

3.8). The figures in this lower panel, which are consistent with data&#13;
previously given in Tables 3.5 and 3.8, provide controls for subsequent&#13;
disaggregations. At this point it can be noted that adjusting from HES to&#13;
obtain this consistency introduces some apparent biases, notably in the&#13;
transfer receipts of Indian and Other households from Companies and&#13;
Government. The control numbers seem to be too low in these instances.&#13;
For each ethnic group, the data in Table 3.10 have been disaggregated&#13;
by location (urban/rural) and the employment status of the main earner&#13;
(employer/employee/own account/other). The figures on total transfer receipts&#13;
in Table 3.5, and on transfer payments to households in Table 3.8 provide&#13;
controls for this disaggregation. Within these, transfer receipts from&#13;
companies have been assumed proportional to savings for those households which&#13;
save in excess of ten percent of income, on the grounds that such transfers&#13;
are essentially dividends and only relatively large savers are likely to hold&#13;
corporate stock. Similarly, transfer receipts from government have been&#13;
assumed proportional to numbers of households, but additionally giving an&#13;
arbitrary weight of two to urban households, and a weighting factor of three&#13;
to households where the normal employment status of the main earner is&#13;
'Other'.&#13;
To distribute inter-household transfers within an ethnic group it has&#13;
been assumed that the flow of transfers is from richer household types to&#13;
poorer ones. Subject to this restriction and, as always, within the&#13;
constraints set by Tables 3.5 and 3.8, the pattern of transfers between&#13;
households is assumed to be uniform in percentage terms. However, the&#13;
restrictions and constraints substantially condition the results, so that the&#13;
patterns which emerge show significant departures from uniformity with a&#13;

general tendency for transfers among households to flow from urban to rural&#13;
areas; and in both urban and rural areas to households in which the main&#13;
earner has occupation status 'Other'.&#13;
The resulting matrices T3.3 , T3.4 and T3.5 are shown in&#13;
Table 3.11 (see p.298) which brings together all the results obtained in this&#13;
chapter except for the full detail of T1.3 which is given in Table 3.9. In&#13;
fact Table 3.11 is a complete SAM and corresponds exactly to the aggregate SAM&#13;
of Chapter 2, Table 2.1 with two differences. The first is that accounts 8 to&#13;
11 are consolidated in Table 3.11. The second is that Table 3.11&#13;
disaggregates the accounts for households into separate accounts for each of&#13;
the 33 household types which we have distinguished. Accordingly, the row and&#13;
column intersection of these accounts yields the matrix T3.3 of current&#13;
transfers between households which dominates Table 3.11.&#13;
The data in T3.3 , T3.4 and T3.5 have been derived by the methods&#13;
discussed above. For the rest, the numbers in Table 3.11 are taken from the&#13;
aggregate SAM, Table 2.1; or from the household income accounts, Table 3.5; or&#13;
from the outlay accounts, Table 3.8. Thus Table 3.11 sets the income and&#13;
outlay accounts for households in their full SAM context. As such it records&#13;
the results of the first major disaggregation of the aggregate SAM which we&#13;
have attempted. In subsequent chapters we attempt other disaggregations and,&#13;
indeed, one consequence of our treatment of the factor accounts in Chapter 4&#13;
is to show further detail on the origin of the factor incomes received by&#13;
households.&#13;

CHAPTER 4&#13;
FACTOR INCOME AND OUTLAY ACCOUNTS&#13;
4.1 The Role of Factor Accounts&#13;
Factors are represented by the accounts number 2 in our schematic SAM&#13;
(Table 2.1). As discussed in the introduction to the previous chapter, our&#13;
objective is to disaggregate factors into 48 different labor types and three&#13;
types of capital, viz. unincorporated business capital, corporate business&#13;
capital, and housing. It follows that there are 51 different factors of&#13;
production in the SAM for Peninsular Malaysia.&#13;
The main role of factor accounts is apparent from Table 1.1: they&#13;
receive value added from production activities (in return for factor&#13;
services), and then distribute this factor income to different institutions&#13;
according to their contributions to factor supplies. These are the main&#13;
mappings which will concern us in this chapter. However, it is clearly&#13;
possible to envisage a SAM in which there are no factor accounts so that value&#13;
added is paid directly to institutions by the production accounts. Indeed&#13;
this is the procedure adopted in one of our earlier SAMs.i/ The question must&#13;
therefore be asked whether factor accounts are valuable as a separate&#13;
dimension of the SAM.&#13;
I/   See Pyatt et al., 'Methodology for Macro-Economic Projections', Working&#13;
Paper No. 12, ILO. Comprehensive employment strategy mission to Iran,&#13;
ILO, Geneva (1972). This study is also discussed in Chapter 5 of&#13;
Blitzer, Clark and Taylor, Economy-wide Models and Development Planning&#13;
(1975), and in Pyatt and Round, 'Social Accounting Matrices in&#13;
Development Planning' (1977). Emphasis in the former is on macro-&#13;
economic models while the latter focusses more on statistical issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
The answer to the above question can be negative if interest is&#13;
restricted to an ex post determination of 'who gets what' out of the national&#13;
product. In this context full information is provided by disaggregated&#13;
accounts for institutions. Retention of accounts for Wants then supplements&#13;
data on the distribution of income across institutions by giving details of&#13;
consumption levels and the extent to which different wants are satisfied.&#13;
Similarly, in the absence of factor accounts, payments of value added&#13;
directly to households would constitute their primary source of income, and&#13;
hence the inter-relationship between production structure and income&#13;
distribution would remain explicit. Thus the elimination of factor accounts&#13;
from the SAM would not undermine its role in bringing issues of equity into&#13;
the major economic data framework.&#13;
The main reason for wanting to retain factor accounts and, by&#13;
extensive disaggregation, to give them far more emphasis than is usual, is&#13;
that two distinct mechanisms are at work in generating the mapping of income&#13;
flows from production to households. By routing these flows through factor&#13;
accounts, we achieve a separation of these issues and hence a basis for&#13;
understanding them in a causal sense.&#13;
The two steps in the linkage are from production activities to&#13;
factors, and then from factors to institutions. The first involves the&#13;
mechanisms of factor markets, and especially employment. Through them the&#13;
factoral distribution of income is determined. And while economic theory is&#13;
some way from a concensus on how the factoral distribution is determined,&#13;
there is a substantial body of literature to draw on in approaching the issues&#13;
which, meanwhile, are well defined. The second step is from the factoral&#13;
distribution of income to the distribution across institutions, and notably&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
across household types. This second mapping is essentially determined by the&#13;
distribution of wealth if we include labor skills as a form of capital. Thus&#13;
the relative endowments of different household types with respect to a&#13;
particular factor will determine their relative shares of that factor's&#13;
income. No other issues are involved if the factor disaggregations justify&#13;
the assumption that each factor market is without imperfections. This clearly&#13;
raises the question of how factor markets are subdivided. But setting that&#13;
aside for a moment, the importance of wealth (defined to include human skills)&#13;
as a fundamental determinant of living standards is made explicit by the SAM&#13;
format when factor accounts are included in the framework. This not only&#13;
emphasizes the importance of initial conditions in determining income&#13;
distribution but also provides an entree to dynamic considerations whereby&#13;
current patterns of savings and investment change the distribution of wealth&#13;
over time and hence determine income distribution in the longer term.&#13;
The distribution of wealth, including human capital, is the basis for&#13;
the mapping from factors to households given the assumption that individual&#13;
factor markets are homogeneous. This assumption, and the mapping itself,&#13;
suggests that the choice of classifications for disaggregating factors is&#13;
important and needs to be considered in relation to the household and other&#13;
institution classifications. This same point has been made in the&#13;
introduction to Chapter 3 where both household and labor classification&#13;
criteria are discussed. As reported there, we have chosen to adopt a three-&#13;
way disaggregation of labor based on:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
location                  race                education level&#13;

Lrurall     x          Chinese      x       Some primary&#13;
Indian]               Complete primary&#13;
Lower Secondary&#13;
Some Upper Secondary&#13;
HSC or higher&#13;
2                      4                         6&#13;
so that the result is to have 48 different types of labor. Since the location&#13;
and race dimensions of this schema are in common with the household&#13;
disaggregation criteria, the mapping is straightforward to this extent. The&#13;
main interest is therefore in mapping labor incomes by education level of&#13;
workers into household types as distinguished by the usual occupation status&#13;
of the principal earner.&#13;
For workers receiving wage income only, the 1973 HES provides a ready&#13;
means of obtaining details on this mapping. But for others the situation is&#13;
more complex. Their incomes as recorded in HES include remuneration of all&#13;
factor services provided to unincorporated business, and therefore include&#13;
payments for factor services other than labor as well as an implicit wage&#13;
component. Hence, it is necessary to impute a wage for such workers, and to&#13;
interpret the difference between this imputed wage and their total factor&#13;
income as a payment to the factor 'unincorporated business capital'. The&#13;
methods adopted to achieve such imputations are discussed in the next section&#13;
of this chapter.&#13;
Section 4.2 is more generally concerned with the mapping of all&#13;
factor incomes to all institutions. Since our attempts to disaggregate the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
Company and Government sectors were ultimately abandoned, there are no&#13;
remaining difficulties in this apart from those that arise in mapping labor&#13;
incomes to households. Similarly, on the factor side we have ultimately&#13;
settled for a simple distinction between corporate and unincorporated business&#13;
capital and housing, with no further disaggregation of capital.&#13;
The income accounts for households which were derived in the previous&#13;
chapter determine a constraint on total household income from wages and&#13;
unincorporated business capital and from rent. These details are consistent&#13;
with the national income accounts for Peninsular Malaysia and hence with total&#13;
value added in domestic production as estimated for national accounts&#13;
purposes. It follows that total income of the factor 'corporate business&#13;
capital' must be determined as a balancing item. In practice our approach has&#13;
been to estimate this last item directly, as discussed in Chapter 6. The true&#13;
residual is therefore the figure for income from unincorporated business&#13;
capital. However, the effect is the same in its implication that once the&#13;
mapping from factors to institutions has been achieved, row totals for factor&#13;
incomes are known and are consistent with the national accounts estimates of&#13;
value added.&#13;
The matrix which gives details of payments to different factors by&#13;
the various production activities is          * It is a short step from the&#13;
position reached at the end of Section 4.2 to the problem of estimating&#13;
T2.10 given constraints on its row totals (set by total factor incomes), and&#13;
on its column totals (as given by national accounts estimates of value added&#13;
in the various production activities). Sections 4.3 and 4.4 set out the&#13;
methodology for estimating this matrix within the given constraints. It turns&#13;
out to be a difficult exercise for two reasons. One is that data sources for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
distributing corporate profits across production activities are of limited&#13;
relevance for our purposes. But given that some significance attaches to&#13;
them, a second source of difficulty is that our calculations suggest a&#13;
somewhat different sectoral breakdown of value added to that of the official&#13;
national income estimates.&#13;
Such divergencies are to be expected and have been encountered&#13;
previously in estimating a social accounting matrix for Sri Lanka.il The&#13;
official estimates for Malaysia are fully up to date methodologically. The&#13;
various estimates, including those for value added, are calculated via a&#13;
commodity balance approach according to current UN recommendations. Our&#13;
exercises have now put these estimates to the further test of consistency with&#13;
respect to income and outlay balances for factors and institutions. It is&#13;
therefore not surprising that this test produces some tensions. They are&#13;
resolved here in a relatively mechanical fashion, taking the official&#13;
estimates as datum. For the longer term, however, the question is raised of&#13;
whether UN recommendations can be improved by adopting a SAM approach.&#13;
In working through this difficult area our first concern has been to&#13;
estimate a manpower matrix showing the employment of each of our 48 labor&#13;
types in each of the 30 production activities. This is complemented by&#13;
estimates of unemployment so as to provide a complete accounting for the labor&#13;
force. The estimation of this matrix is described in Section 4.3. Then, in&#13;
Section 4.4, the matrix T2.10 is estimated in two stages. First, value&#13;
added in each production activity is distributed between labor income (in&#13;
aggregate) and the income accruing to each of the three types of capital.&#13;
1/   See Pyatt and Roe with Lindley, Round and others (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
Then the wage incomes estimated in the first stage are distributed across the&#13;
48 labor types so as to be consistent with the estimates of total income by&#13;
labor type derived in Section 4.2. In other words, a full 48 x 30 matrix of&#13;
wage payments is estimated consistent with totals for its rows and columns&#13;
which have previously been derived. The method used takes the manpower matrix&#13;
of Section 4.3 as its basis and effectively imposes a theory as to how wage&#13;
rates differ by labor type and activity of employment. The implications of&#13;
this theory are discussed in terms of the empirical results obtained.&#13;
Finally, the chapter concldues with some thoughts on the appropriate&#13;
classification of production activities within a SAM framework.&#13;
4.2 Mapping from Factor Incomes to Households and Other Institutions&#13;
The previous section has explained that SAM distinguishes 48 types of&#13;
labor. In addition there are separate accounts for dwellings, unincorporated&#13;
business capital and the capital employed by corporate business, making a&#13;
total of 51 factor accounts in all. Income from corporate capital accrues to&#13;
the company sector and is discussed in Chapter 6, while income derived from&#13;
ownership of dwellings is already mapped into the 32 household types in Table&#13;
3.5. The same table also shows the distribution of wage income and&#13;
unincorporated business income across household types. It remains, then,&#13;
first to split unincorporated business income between a pure profit component&#13;
and an imputed wage element, and then to distribute both imputed and actual&#13;
wages across the 48 labor types distinguished in the SAM. The HES is&#13;
maintained as the main source of information for these operations, with&#13;
corresponding adjustment factors taken from Table 3.1 to obtain final&#13;
consistency with National Accounts. The basis of the calculations is that the&#13;
factor incomes which households derive from labor services are determined by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
their particular endowments of different types of labor in association with an&#13;
actual or an imputed wage.&#13;
The matrix which maps labor incomes into households is assumed to&#13;
have a simple structure. Specifically, urban (rural) households are assumed&#13;
to supply only urban (rural) labor; and all members of a particular household&#13;
are assumed to be of the same race. These assumptions are not likely to be&#13;
violated very often in practice. Their imposition implies that the matrix of&#13;
wage payments to households will be block diagonal. i And each block will be&#13;
of dimension 4 x 6 corresponding to the four-way disaggregation of households&#13;
according to the usual occupation status of the principal earner, and the six-&#13;
way disaggregation of labor by education level.&#13;
Basic wages&#13;
The first step towards determining details of this block diagonal&#13;
matrix has been to define a concept of basic wages; being actual wage payments&#13;
plus employers' contributions to provident funds plus benefits in kind. The&#13;
second step is to derive matrices mapping from factors to households; one&#13;
showing basic wages received by households from each type of factor, and the&#13;
other showing numbers of individuals receiving basic wages who are involved in&#13;
this mapping process. The latter can be thought of as a household endowments&#13;
matrix. Table 4.1 sets out details of such mappings for Urban Malay&#13;
households. The details are taken directly from the HES and the dimensions of&#13;
each matrix in Table 4.1 illustrates the structure of the 4 x 6 blocks&#13;
1/   It might be useful to refer forward to the results in Table 4.7 so as to&#13;
observe the block structure referred to here.&#13;

referred to in the previous paragraph. Clearly, tables similar to Table 4.1&#13;
can be constructed for Urban Chinese households, Rural Malay households,&#13;
etc. Thus Table 4.1 illustrates one of the eight blocks defined by the&#13;
location and race dimensions of the household and labor force classifi-&#13;
cations. In fact, to ease exposition, wherever appropriate in this section&#13;
the estimation methods will be described for the 'Urban-Malay'&#13;
factor/household group. The same methods apply to other groups.&#13;
Table 4.1 has two panels. Panel (a) shows numbers of individuals&#13;
receiving basic wages according to the HES, while panel (b) records the amount&#13;
of basic wages they receive. As can be seen from panel (a), some of the&#13;
numbers obtained are quite small and, especially for education groups 5 (Some&#13;
Upper Secondary) and 6 (HSC or higher), the data is somewhat sparse. This&#13;
highlights the fact that the mesh of 32 households and 48 factors is about the&#13;
limit of disaggregation which the HES can sustain.&#13;
Dividing the basic wage income in a cell of the second panel of Table&#13;
4.1 by the corresponding number of basic wage earners, given in the first&#13;
panel, would yield a 4 x 6 matrix of average basic wages by household type and&#13;
education level. However, this calculation obviously cannot be performed when&#13;
cell entries are zero and, more generally, small cell sample size would imply&#13;
large standard errors associated with some of the averages. Accordingly, a&#13;
smoothing procedurei/ has been used to obtain estimates of the effects of&#13;
household type and education on earnings. This procedure results in the&#13;
derived statistics r and s which border panel (a) of Table 4.1. Their&#13;
character is that the ith r value, multiplied by the jth s value is an&#13;
1/ The RAS method has been applied; see the Technical Appendix.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
estimate of average basic wage income for earners of such income who belong to&#13;
the ith household type and are in the jth educational category .1/ Thus&#13;
basic wage earners of educational level 3 in households where the usual&#13;
occupation of the principal income earner is 'Own Account worker' have a&#13;
predicted average income of 0.425 x 0.224 = 0.095. There are seven such&#13;
individuals, so their predicted total income is 7 x 0.091 = 0.67. In fact,&#13;
reference to panel (b) of Table 4.1 shows that actual wage income for this&#13;
group is 0.7, so the discrepancy is 0.7 - 0.64 = 0.06.&#13;
Similar discrepancies can be calculated for all cells of panel (b) of&#13;
Table 4.1 and the particular values for r's and s's which have been&#13;
selected are chosen to satisfy the condition that the sum of all discrepancies&#13;
in each row and column of the income matrix should be zero. The values of&#13;
r and s are uniquely determined by this method to within a scalar. Thus&#13;
all  r's  could be multiplied by, say, 2 and all    s's  divided by 2 without&#13;
changing any of the predictions for cell entries. To fix this question of&#13;
scale, r's and s's have been determined subject to the rule that the r&#13;
for household type 'Employee' is always one. This means that the other values&#13;
of r can be interpreted as effects of household type on basic wages relative&#13;
to those of 'Employee' households. Table 4.2 sets out these relative values&#13;
of r for all household types, using the convention that for each&#13;
location/ethnic household group, values of r are relative to 'Employee'&#13;
households.&#13;
1/   As a theoretical model, the procedures imply that the logarithm of basic&#13;
wage is predicted by a row effect (household type) and a column effect&#13;
(education level) with no interactions allowed between the two.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
A first point to note from Table 4.2 is that data are sparse for some&#13;
of the household types so that estimated effects are impossible to obtain or&#13;
are of poor quality in these instances. Next, it can be noted that average&#13;
wage earnings tend to be lower than those of employees when the principal&#13;
earner is an employer who has a wage income. This almost certainly reflects a&#13;
tendency for employers to pay themselves too little as wage income and to draw&#13;
remuneration through unincorporated business income. Hence, except for Urban-&#13;
Indian households where this phenomenon is not observed, a wage has been&#13;
imputed to bring the level up to that of Employees of the same educational&#13;
level, race and location. This imputed wage is then deducted from&#13;
unincorporated business income. This adjustment will be returned to&#13;
subsequently.&#13;
Table 4.2 also shows that basic wage earners earn less when the&#13;
principal earner in their household is an Own Account worker than they do when&#13;
the principal earner is an employee. It is interesting to note that the ratio&#13;
is lowest when the household is Malay (both in urban and rural areas); and&#13;
most when the household is Chinese. The implication is that employment status&#13;
of the principal earner explains less of the variation in individual wage&#13;
earnings among Chinese than it does among Malays.&#13;
Table 4.3 compares the different values of s obtained in the&#13;
calculations. These capture differentials in basic wages depending on&#13;
education attainment. They reveal two strong tendencies. One is the steep&#13;
gradation in wages as education level rises. The other is the general premium&#13;
of Urban over Rural employment, which is much more marked for Malays than it&#13;
is for either Indians or Chinese. Both of these results confirm prior&#13;
expectations.&#13;

There are two final comments about procedures for estimating the&#13;
mapping of basic wages from factors to households. The first is a fairly&#13;
obvious point about the use of the HES sample results. In the absence of&#13;
information about sampling fractions for each of the household categories, we&#13;
implicitly assumed the sampling fractions was uniform across all categories.&#13;
The second point is a statement about what we actually did, as opposed to what&#13;
we might have done.   In calculating the final wage payments notices (see Table&#13;
4.7) the basic wage elements were obtained as scaled-up versions of Table&#13;
4.1(b): that is, the scale factor of 2.913 was applied to each element of&#13;
Table 4.1(b) in order to be consistent with the National Accounts total, as&#13;
described earlierJ./ The r and s multipliers, as components of the HES-based&#13;
basic wage were used in the estimation of imputed wages for non-basic wage&#13;
earners. These methods are described shortly. Equally, however, the r and s&#13;
multipliers and Table 4.1(a) could have been used, together with the 2.913&#13;
scale factor, to estimate basic wage income.&#13;
Imputed wage income&#13;
There are two adjustments which have to be made to the matrices of&#13;
basic wages before arriving at a final matrix which adequately reflects&#13;
household receipts of wages arising from the services of different kinds of&#13;
labor. Both adjustments involve imputations, so that total wages are to be&#13;
estimated as basic wages plus these imputed components. The first adjustment&#13;
has been referred to earlier and involves raising the wage earnings of&#13;
employers to bring them up to the level of employees. The second adjustment&#13;
involves estimation of an imputed wage as part of the income from&#13;
unincorporated business activity.&#13;

These steps in the process of calculating factor payments to&#13;
households require the data shown in Table 4.4 which once again refers to&#13;
Urban-Malay households: similar tables have been obtained from the HES for&#13;
the seven other household groups defined by location and race. Table 4.4&#13;
serves by way of an illustration of the general method which we adopted. The&#13;
table has two panels; panel (a) records the number of income earners who&#13;
receive unincorporated business income only, again according to household type&#13;
and educational level of the individual. The second panel, (b), simply&#13;
records the total unincorporated business income received by all individuals&#13;
of the labor type in question. This includes the unincorporated business&#13;
income received by individuals who also receive basic wages.&#13;
The problem faced at this stage is to draw off some of the&#13;
unincorporated business income in the lower panel as imputed wages for the&#13;
income earners in the upper panel. What is then left as a residual in the&#13;
lower panel is a measure of income from unincorporated business capital, i.e.&#13;
the surplus generated by unincorporated businesses operated by different types&#13;
of households after subtracting off an imputed wage income component.&#13;
This general objective is achieved in three steps as follows:&#13;
(i) The lower panel of Table 4.4 is scaled upwards by a factor of&#13;
3.208 to obtain consistency with the National Accounts. This scaling&#13;
factor is taken from Table 3.1.&#13;
(ii) Imputed wages are subtracted from the result of (i) so as to bring&#13;
wage earnings by employers up to the level of employees as previously&#13;
discussed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
(iii) An imputed wage matrix is subtracted from the result of (ii).&#13;
This matrix is essentially derived from the upper panel of Table 4.4&#13;
using some appropriately derived row and column multipliers which stand&#13;
proxy for estimated average imputed wage rates. These multipliers are&#13;
applied to the data in panel (a) to estimate the imputed wage rate.&#13;
The result is then an estimated matrix for unincorporated business profit for&#13;
Urban-Malay households. Replicating the exercise for other household types&#13;
yields a complete picture of unincorporated business profit receipts. Details&#13;
of factor wage incomes received by household type can then be obtained by&#13;
adding the actual basic wage matrix (i.e. Table 4.1(b)), scaled by 2.913 to&#13;
obtain consistency with the national accounts) to the two matrices which are&#13;
subtracted from incorporated business incomes in steps (ii) and (iii) above.&#13;
In other words, basic wages plus imputed wages yield total wages.&#13;
Table 4.5 sets out the final details of the mapping from factor&#13;
incomes to household typesl/ and it will be clear from the above description&#13;
of the methods used that the crucial procedure is the imputation of wages at&#13;
step (iii). This requires further explanation. As in the derivation of basic&#13;
wage incomes, this is done by assuming values for row and column multipliers&#13;
r and s   which enable the matrix of income earners shown in Table 4.4(a) to&#13;
be translated into a matrix of imputed wage incomes.&#13;
1/   It should be noted that there are some minor discrepancies in the results&#13;
for the urban-Malay 4 x 6 matrix of wage income shown in Table 4.5 and&#13;
those which would be obtained from a strict application of the procedure&#13;
described above. These arise from the use of slightly erroneous r and s&#13;
multipliers and do not affect subsequent results. Regrettably, these&#13;
errors were observed at a relatively late stage in the preparation of the&#13;
final draft of the study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
The choice of column multipliers,    s    is straightforward:   the&#13;
values of    s  obtained for Urban-Malay households in Table 4.1(a) (and more&#13;
generally set out in Table 4.3) have been used. Accordingly, educational&#13;
differentials are assumed to be the same for both imputed wages and actual&#13;
wages; and they may vary somewhat as between ethnic groups and urban versus&#13;
rural areas.&#13;
The derivation of the row multipliers r is more difficult. For&#13;
household type 'Employer' the row multiplier is taken as the actual value in&#13;
Table 4.1(a) for 'Employees', that is, 1.000. The rationale for doing this&#13;
has already been discussed. However, this value must be scaled up by 2.913 to&#13;
adjust the figures to National Accounts controls. So the actual figure used&#13;
is 1.0 x 2.913 = 2.913. The inference is that income earners who do not earn&#13;
wages and who are located in households where the main earner is an employer&#13;
could in fact earn the wage that is actually paid to wage earners in&#13;
households where the principal earner is an employee.&#13;
For individuals who are in households where the main earner has the&#13;
usual status 'Own Account worker' or 'Other', the same row multiplier is used&#13;
in Table 4.4(a) as in Table 4.1(a) (but again scaled for consistency by&#13;
2.913). It is therefore assumed that individual workers in such households&#13;
who earn only unincorporated business income could earn wages identical to&#13;
those of individuals in these same households who do in fact receive basic&#13;
wages.&#13;

If a similar assumption is made to impute a wage for those workers in&#13;
Employee households who receive only unincorporated business incomes and no&#13;
wages, then the consequence for all of the Malay and Indian households (but&#13;
not fet-all Chinese households) would be implied negative profit income from&#13;
unincorporated businesses. This clearly suggests that the proposed imputed&#13;
wage is too high. And this is to be expected on a priori grounds. In&#13;
Employee households the main earner has the usual status 'Employee' and will&#13;
earn a wage. Accordingly, those who are not earning wages will not be main&#13;
earners and therefore will earn less than the main earner. It follows that a&#13;
lower wage from that of the main earner must be imputed to them.&#13;
The chosen imputed wage is the same as that imputed to workers in Own&#13;
Account households who do not earn wages. The reason for this assumption is&#13;
that such workers earn only unincorporated business income and the market&#13;
value of their labor services is not affected by whether the main earner in&#13;
their household is an Employee or an Own Account worker. Therefore, the&#13;
shadow price which attaches to the labor serviles of those who do not work for&#13;
wages is taken as being the same for the two groups.&#13;
Summary of household wage income calculations&#13;
These methods of wage imputation can be summarized as follows. The&#13;
analysis has distinguished 384 different types of workers corresponding to 48&#13;
labor types (location, race and education level); the usual employment status&#13;
of the principal income earner for the household in which the worker resides&#13;
(4 groups); and a distinction between workers who earn basic wages and those&#13;
who do not (and therefore receive only incorporated business income). For all&#13;
workers who actually earn basic wages, a predicted average wage has been&#13;
calculated and is given by the product of the appropriate r and s&#13;
variables shown in Tables 4.2 and 4.3. The estimates of actual and imputed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
wages are then built up according to the schema set out in Table 4.6.&#13;
One way of looking at Table 4.6 is to ignore the difference between&#13;
predicted and actual wages. Workers then fall into three groups.&#13;
(a) All workers in Employer households and basic wage earners in&#13;
Employee households are imputed the average wage of the latter. Since&#13;
this involves an r factor of 1.0 these wages are given (exactly or&#13;
approximately) by the s variables in Table 4.3. For the second and&#13;
third group of workers, the wage rate is given by the product of the&#13;
same s factors and a factor r which is not equal to one.&#13;
(b) For all workers in Own Account households and those in Employee&#13;
households who are not basic wage earners, the r factor used is the one&#13;
derived for basic wage earners in Own Account households. In other&#13;
words, households in this category have their actual average wage or, if&#13;
they are not basic wage earners, the average wage of those in Own Account&#13;
households who do earn basic wages.&#13;
(c) Finally, those in Other households who earn only unincorporated&#13;
business income are imputed the average wage of those in such households&#13;
who do earn basic wages.&#13;
In this way, and ignoring the distinction between a predicted and average&#13;
wage, each of 384 types of workers has, or is assumed to have, one of 144 (= 3&#13;
x 48) different average wage rates.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
The above method of imputing wages is open to several objections in&#13;
addition to those which may be of a procedural nature. Not least, it makes no&#13;
distinction between full-time and part-time workers, nor does it disaggregate&#13;
the labor force by sex or age. Moreover, there is no allowance for&#13;
individuals working part-time in an unincorporated business and part-time for&#13;
wages. These are all major limitations. However, there can be two&#13;
justifications for stopping the analysis at this stage. One is that at some&#13;
point the problems of sample size become insuperable, and effects beyond those&#13;
for location, race, education and employment status of principal earner are&#13;
increasingly difficult to discern. A second argument is that, in some general&#13;
sense, the results obtained at the present stage appear to be reasonable.&#13;
This general sense of reasonableness must rest largely on the methods&#13;
used to obtain results. However, the consequences are also of interest and it&#13;
is to be noted that at the 32 x 6 level of disaggregation, estimated&#13;
unincorporated business profits are negative in relatively few cases and then&#13;
only to a minor degree. Most of these cases arise in households where the&#13;
usual occupational status of the main earner is 'Other'. Generally, negative&#13;
values have been suppressed by lowering the row multiplier for imputed wages&#13;
to income earners who do not receive basic wages. This is the only deviation&#13;
from the methods described above and in practice it makes little difference&#13;
since the numbers involved are never large.&#13;
The results set out in Table 4.5 are consistent with the details of&#13;
household incomes from wages and unincorporated business incomes given in&#13;
Table 3.5. They show the profit element of unincorporated business income as&#13;
56 percent of the total, so that imputed wages account for 44 percent. In&#13;
general, unincorporated business profits constitute approximately half of&#13;
total factor incomes in all households where the main earner is either an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
Employer or Own Account worker. They are of relatively minor importance for&#13;
other household types. Thus the results endorse the importance of employment&#13;
status of the main earner as a criterion for disaggregating households.&#13;
Previously, Table 4.3 has shown the importance of education in factor&#13;
markets. It would seem that if further disaggregation in labor markets was to&#13;
be considered, the most interesting criterion would be according to the&#13;
formal/informal production status of the place of work. Such a distinction&#13;
might clarify the discussion of imputed wages and, meanwhile, may underlie the&#13;
differences in basic wages by household type which have been observed. For&#13;
the present, however, the disaggregation into 48 labor types seems to capture&#13;
some important dimensions.&#13;
To conclude this section, Table 4.7 (see p.299) brings together&#13;
results from this section and previous results to provide details of the&#13;
Factor Outlay Accounts. These cover not only actual and imputed wages, but&#13;
also income from unincorporated business capital, corporate business profits&#13;
and rent. The table clearly shows the block diagonal structure of the&#13;
matrix T3.2 and most of the detailed figures for income from Housing come&#13;
from Table 3.5, while the outlay account for corporate capital is based on&#13;
figures which are to be derived in Chapter 6.&#13;
4.3 A Manpower Matrix for Peninsular Malaysia&#13;
This section considers the estimation of a manpower matrix as a&#13;
preliminary step to the mapping of domestic value added across factors and&#13;
activities. Since elements of the matrix are numbers of people and not&#13;
financial flows, there are no constraints imposed on the manpower matrix from&#13;
previous calculations or national accounts. However, it is apparent that a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
wage rate multiplied by an element of the manpower matrix yields a financial&#13;
flow in terms of the total wage payment to a particular type of labor by a&#13;
particular activity. Thus the manpower matrix underlies that part of the&#13;
mapping from activities to factor payments which relates to wages; and the&#13;
wage rates paid provide the missing link.&#13;
The manpower matrix to be estimated here has dimensions 48 x 31. The&#13;
row dimension corresponds to the 48 types of labor previously discussed, while&#13;
the column dimension refers to 30 distinct production activities plus a&#13;
further column to record numbers unemployed. Thus the total labor force, by&#13;
type of labor, is given by row sums, including unemployed rather than just the&#13;
numbers currently employed.&#13;
The 30 different production activities distinguished in our analysis&#13;
have been enumerated in Chapter 2 1/, while the next chapter gives some&#13;
further details on their relationship with input-output and national accounts&#13;
classifications. Here they will simply be taken as given, although at the end&#13;
of this chapter we comment on desirable classification criteria for production&#13;
activities in the light of our general approach.&#13;
While details of the manpower matrix are not constrained by any&#13;
financial statistics, our procedure has been one more to base details on the&#13;
HES Survey but to modify these within control figures provided by other data&#13;
sources. In the present case, the control data sources are the 1970&#13;
Population Census and the details of employment and unemployment in 1970&#13;
provided by the Third Malaysia Plan (TMP).&#13;
1/ See Table 2.9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ill -&#13;
Constraints on employment from these latter sources have been built&#13;
up as follows. Figures from the TMP have been taken to be inviolable since&#13;
they have previously been derived consistent with the 1970 National Income&#13;
Accounts. These show totals by race and activity, including the numbers&#13;
unemployed. For those employed, some detail is provided by the Population&#13;
Census which unfortunately permits only a 22-way disaggregation of production&#13;
rather than our 30 separate activities. However, within this limitation,&#13;
employment can be disaggregated by location, race and activity, using the&#13;
Population Census as source. When these results are constrained by the TMP&#13;
marginal totals, the manpower matrix shown as Table 4.8 is obtained.l/&#13;
Our final manpower matrix is shown as Table 4.9 (see p.300). This is&#13;
a full 48 x 31 matrix based on the HES but constrained both by the figures&#13;
given in Table 4.8 and by the further details available in the TMP document&#13;
relating to (i) unemployment and (ii) total employment within SAM&#13;
activities,-/ both of which are covered in more aggregative fashion in the&#13;
Population Census. It is worth recording here that the constraints imposed on&#13;
the HES for employment do not modify the latter to any great extent with&#13;
respect to total employment by type of labor: the HES is reasonably&#13;
consistent with other sources with respect to total employment by race and&#13;
location, and is the only source covering the education dimension. The main&#13;
inconsistencies are to be found, therefore, with respect to employment by&#13;
activity. This is to be expected since there are obvious difficulties in the&#13;
1/ RAS was again used to obtain the manpower matrix.&#13;
2/ Employment by SAM activities is not directly available within the TMP&#13;
document but was provided for us by the Department of Statistics, Kuala&#13;
Lumpur.&#13;

survey context of identifying the activities in which people work, notably&#13;
with respect to activities such as 'Other agriculture' and among service&#13;
industries. The TMP control data goes some way to overcoming these&#13;
difficulties. And the fact that row totals of the manpower matrix have close&#13;
correlation with the HES labor force breakdown implies that the figures in&#13;
Table 4.5 for wages by type of labor can be accepted as SAM controls for this&#13;
part of the factoral distribution of income.&#13;
4.4 Value Added and Factor Incomes&#13;
At this stage in the analysis the row totals of the matrix T2.9 can&#13;
be taken as given. For labor incomes they are given by the details of Table&#13;
4.5 and this same source fixes unincorporated business profits. The methods&#13;
by which these figures are derived ensure that when added to our estimates of&#13;
income from housing and corporate profits (which are discussed in Chapter 6),&#13;
the grand total is equal to the gross domestic product and therefore equal to&#13;
the sum of value added in each production activity.&#13;
Estimates of value added in each of the 30 production activities are&#13;
availablel/ and have been taken as datum. These are recorded in Table 4.10&#13;
(see p.301). The table also shows initial estimates of the factor components&#13;
of value added and the final estimates adopted.&#13;
The first row of Table 4.10 shows an estimate of actual wage incomes&#13;
plus unincorporated business income which has been obtained as a direct&#13;
tabulation from the HES with suitable scaling to give the appropriate row&#13;
total. These figures from the HES, prior to scaling, can be divided by HES&#13;
estimates of numbers of people in each activity to give an average income per&#13;

worker for each activity)-Y Applying these averages to the number of workers&#13;
in each activity as given by the manpower matrix (and therefore as given by&#13;
the TMP) yields an alternative estimate to that in the first row. These&#13;
alternative estimates are recorded in the second row of Table 4.10. The third&#13;
row of Table 4.10 records corporate profits as measured in a 1971 Financial&#13;
Survey,./ while the final row gives the national accounts estimate of rent.&#13;
It is apparent from an examination of these figures and the control&#13;
figures for value added that there are a number of problems to be faced in&#13;
obtaining a reconciliation. But before coming to the assumptions actually&#13;
made in the reconciliation process, it is worthwhile making some comment on&#13;
these initial estimates. The data in the first row are likely to be&#13;
inaccurate for three reasons. One reason is, simply, sampling error. A&#13;
second reason is due to the fact that the HES refers to 1973 while our concern&#13;
here is with details for 1970. And the third source of error is that&#13;
individuals may either misrecord their incomes.3/ or be misclassified with&#13;
respect to the sector of employment. Some part of all these errors should&#13;
already be corrected in the estimates recorded in the second row of the table,&#13;
since they are based on relatively firm figures for employment in 1970.&#13;
Accordingly, the estimates in the second row are generally to be preferred.&#13;

HES, an average wage had to be estimated independently for this sector.&#13;

Data from the 1971 Financial Survey have limitations partly because&#13;
of changes in economic circumstances between 1970 and 1971 and partly because&#13;
it is extremely difficult to classify companies according to the 30 production&#13;
activities. These limitations notwithstanding, there are some major&#13;
discrepancies between the alternative estimates of value added in rows 5 and 6&#13;
of Table 4.10 and the national accounts estimates in row 7. It suggests that&#13;
the national accounts estimates for some sectors ought to be revised or at&#13;
least reconsidered. However, this was not an option which we entertained so&#13;
that the issue of how to eliminate 'the'discrepancies had stil'l to be faced.&#13;
The methods used to reconcile the figures had a substantial pragmatic&#13;
element. These were essentially two steps.- *The first was to produce a&#13;
revised set of estimates which came closer to, but did not necessarily exactly&#13;
satisfy the control data. Then, as a second step, these revised estimates&#13;
were forced to satisfy the control data by using the RAS method. The results&#13;
obtained are given in rows 8 to 11 of Table 4.10.&#13;
The revised estimates which'emerged from step one of our procedures&#13;
accorded with the manpower matrix estimates in-row 2 of Table 4.10 in all but&#13;
eight cases. Four of the exceptions are sectors 26 to 29 all of which are&#13;
Government Service Sectors.   Since there is no corporate activity in these&#13;
sectors, we have no alternative but to-replace the figure in row 2 by the&#13;
control figure for value added in these cases.   These same arguments applied&#13;
to Padi (activity 4) and Livestock (activity 6).   This was despite the fact&#13;
that value added in Livestock seems to be a substantial overestimate. The two&#13;
remaining exceptions were Rubber (activity 1) and Other Agriculture (activity&#13;
5).  In both these cases the estimate derived directly from the HES was used&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
since the constraining value added figures would have otherwise implied&#13;
estimates of corporate profits which were much too low.&#13;
Having adopted the figures in row 2, or some alternatives for them as&#13;
described above, these data were split within each activity between wages and&#13;
unincorporated business profits according to the proportions observed as a&#13;
result of applying the wage imputation procedures of Section 4.2 above to the&#13;
HES survey results. This then yielded initial estimates of labor income and&#13;
income of unincorporated business capital. However, these estimates did not&#13;
satisfy the required row totals and were therefore subject to further&#13;
adjustment as described below.&#13;
An initial estimate of row 10 of Table 4.10 was obtained simply by&#13;
subtracting the provisional figures for rows 8 and 9 from the value added&#13;
controls. These residuals were accepted as initial estimates of corporate&#13;
profits in all sectors outside manufacturing. Within manufacturing, the&#13;
residuals diverged sufficiently from the Financial Survey estimates for some&#13;
sectors to suggest (on a subjective basis) that the latter estimates were&#13;
preferable. Accordingly, the Financial Survey estimates were adopted for&#13;
sectors 11 to 14, 16 and 19, i.e. for Drink and tobacco, Other Food processing&#13;
industries, Saw Mills, Furniture, Basic Metals and Chemicals.&#13;
At this point an initial estimate of each element of rows 8 to 11 of&#13;
Table 4.10 is arrived at. Obviously there was no reason for them to add up&#13;
row-wise or column-wise to the desired totals but they did come closer than&#13;
the figures in rows 1 to 4. They were therefore constrained to meet the row&#13;
and column control figures by applying the RAS method to the initial&#13;
estimates. In this way the numbers shown in rows 8 to 11 of Table 4.10 were&#13;
obtained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
To complete the estimation of matrix T2.9 it now only remained to&#13;
disaggregate row 8 of Table 4.10 into incomes for each of the 48 labor&#13;
types. This was achieved by again applying RAS, but this time using the&#13;
manpower matrix as the initialising matrix. The details of labor incomes in&#13;
Table 4.5 provided for constraints for this purpose and those in row 8 of&#13;
Table 4.10 provided the column constraints. The resulting estimate of&#13;
matrix T2.9 is set out as Table 4.11 (see p.302).&#13;
The quality of the results in Table 4.11 is difficult to assess. In&#13;
part the problems encountered in their derivation are due to our acceptance of&#13;
the value added figures from National Accounts as being sacrosanct.&#13;
Relatively small changes for a few sectors would greatly ease the problem of&#13;
reconciliation. Equally, such changes would imply subsequent adjustments&#13;
elsewhere in the SAM since this is the nature of the consistency approach.&#13;
From a somewhat different point of view, the difficulties reported in this&#13;
chapter are irrelevant. One of our main concerns is to show that a SAM can be&#13;
built in which both income distribution and conventional national accounts are&#13;
reconciled. If this was to be the approach to estimating national accounts&#13;
from the outset, using both commodity balances and income/outlay balances as T2.10&#13;
controls, then all elements would be estimated simultaneously and not in the&#13;
sequential manner illustrated here, whereby the national accounts are based&#13;
solely on commodity balances with an attempt to secure income/outlay&#13;
consistency as a subsequent step. Looked at from yet another point of view,&#13;
we might simply have introduced a 'residual error' at this stage of our work&#13;
and let it go at that.&#13;
With these comments as background, some inferences can be drawn from&#13;
results in this chapter which amplify the latter and have some bearing on&#13;
&#13;

their quality. They refer specifically to the theory of wages which&#13;
potentially supports the methods used. Thus a theory of wages underlies the&#13;
wage imputation methods discussed in Chapter 4.2 and an analogous theory lies&#13;
behind the final RAS calculations in the present section. These two sets of&#13;
results may therefore be compared.&#13;
In both sets of calculations the wage (actual or imputed) of a worker&#13;
is considered to be the product of two terms. These can be referred to as&#13;
x  and  y  factors ./   In the treatment of Section 4.2 the   x  factor is given&#13;
by the type of labor, while the y factor refers to type of household. Thus&#13;
there are 48 alternative values of x corresponding to the 48 labor types and&#13;
given numerically by the variables r recorded in Table 4.3 . Associated&#13;
with these are 32 household types but, through the imputation procedures set&#13;
out in Table 4.6 , there are only 24 alternative values of the y factor,&#13;
corresponding numerically to selected values of the s variable in Table 4.2.&#13;
In the derivation of the wage matrix in this section, there are again&#13;
48 values of the x factor which correspond, as in Section 4.2, to the&#13;
various types of labor. These are given numerically by the row multipliers of&#13;
the RAS method and presented numerically in Table 4.12. Corresponding to&#13;
these are 30 possible y factors - one for each production activity - and&#13;
these are given numerically by the column multipliers of the RAS method.&#13;
Table 4.13 records the numbers.&#13;

Figures in parentheses refer to less than one percent of the labor force.&#13;
It can be seen that labor type - the x-factor - is common to both&#13;
sets of calculations. It is therefore of interest to compare the results in&#13;
Tables 4.3 and 4.12. In doing so it should be recalled that the difference in&#13;
scale between the two sets of figures is irrelevant since scale is arbitrary&#13;
in RAS calculations.&#13;
Table 4.12 shows essentially the same tendencies as Table 4.3&#13;

importance of education comes through once more. However, there is more&#13;
(apparent) random variation in the latter set of figures which might be&#13;
expected both on account of 'sparseness' in the manpower matrix and the fact&#13;
that the Table 4.12 results involve both a data base of mixed primary sources&#13;
and some rather ad hoc procedures. In view of the steps involved in moving&#13;
from Section 4.2 to the final results, the closeness of fit may be considered&#13;
reassuring.&#13;
While the x-factors involved in both sets of estimates have the same&#13;
definition, different numerical results could be expected simply on the&#13;
grounds of differences in definition of the y factors in the two cases.i&#13;
It is undoubtedly the case that the household-type composition of the labor&#13;
force is not the same in all industries. Most obviously, Own Account&#13;
households tend to be concentrated in certain industries. Accordingly, the&#13;
y-factors are picking up some of the same effects in the separate&#13;
calculations. But they are by no means identical.&#13;
The results in Table 4.13 show which is the most attractive industry&#13;
in which to work, given the type of labor with respect to location, race and&#13;
educational level. It is no surprise to find Petroleum near the top of the&#13;
list, although the extent of its premium over other industries probably owes&#13;
much to an error in the estimation referred to in the footnote on page 33.&#13;
Livestock also ranks surprisingly high but this result may almost certainly be&#13;
traced back to problematic value added data. For the rest the results are&#13;
1/   Within the RAS framework there is a problem of specification bias&#13;
analogous to that for least squares. Thus the fact that the x- and y-&#13;
factors are not independent, while the y- factor has a different&#13;
designation in the two exercises, can be one reason why estimates of&#13;
the x- factor may differ between the two cases.&#13;

more or less as might be expected, although prior expectations may have placed&#13;
Government sector employment higher up the list. But here the results are&#13;
largely dictated by TMP employment estimates and value added in National&#13;
Accounts. As it is, the prevalence of part-time female employment could fully&#13;
account for the lowest positions going to Furniture and Textiles, while there&#13;
is no surprise in finding Padi, Other Agriculture, and Fishing low on the&#13;
list.&#13;
These results capture the broad sweep of known features of income&#13;
structure in Malaysia, while pointing up some statistical weaknesses. They&#13;
suggest that the level of disaggregation attempted may have been too&#13;
ambitious, at the same time indicating an appropriate remedy. This is to&#13;
eliminate the race dimension in labor markets since the figures show that in&#13;
1970 this has the least explanatory power as compared with education and the&#13;
urban/rural distinction. In terms of the wage matrix, education level and&#13;
industry of employment are the most powerful influences on income. Since&#13;
these general results seem to be independent of our statistical difficulties,&#13;
they are of some specific relevance for Malaysia and give a more general&#13;
indication of the insights into income structure that can emerge from the SAM&#13;
approach.&#13;
4.5 Production Classifications&#13;
The analysis in Chapter 3 and the present chapter has presented some&#13;
difficult problems of data reconciliation. In facing up to them - admittedly&#13;
guess;timating numbers on occasion and more generally forcing consistency - we&#13;
hope to have shown the feasibility of grafting detailed income and outlay&#13;
accounts onto national accounts which have been derived via a commodity&#13;
balance approach. We suggest that the exercise might have been easier if a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
SAM approach to national accounts had been adopted at the outset, but evidence&#13;
on this must lie in the future. Meanwhile some attempt has been made to&#13;
suggest appropriate criteria for disaggregation of Factors and Institutions.&#13;
We now address the question of how the Production classification&#13;
might be structured. Following common practice and UN standards, production&#13;
is classified in Malaysia with reference to commodity groupings. This is&#13;
discussed more fully in the next chapter but for now we note that lying behind&#13;
the figures is a 107 sector inter-industry data base. This amount of detail&#13;
on production seems misplaced from a SAM viewpoint which sees the&#13;
disaggregation of institutions as the primary concern. But if it is decided&#13;
that there is to be some such detailed disaggregation, the question of whether&#13;
this should be exclusively commodity-based is worth considering. One of the&#13;
implications of the statistical problems encountered so far is that it would&#13;
make good sense to include a corporate/non-corporate dimension in the&#13;
production classification. This would go a long way towards capturing&#13;
economic duality and may render redundant a specifically technological&#13;
dimension in the classification criterion. Similarly, it may be more relevant&#13;
to envisage rural/urban and foreign versus domestic control as dichotomies&#13;
within the production classification, especially when contrasted with the&#13;
bleakness of the contemporary preoccupation with commodities. Of course some&#13;
detail must be retained on the commodity dimension. But there is little fear&#13;
of contradiction in stating that&#13;
[omestically controlled corporate        Rural        18 Commodity&#13;
|Foreign controlled corporate        x   Urban    x       Groups   I&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
commodities is equal. In fact, for the Malaysia SAM the commodities dimension&#13;
is almost twice that for the production activities although there is no reason&#13;
in principle why this relativity could not be reversed, i.e. more activities&#13;
than commodities.&#13;
Table 5.1 sets out the version of our general SAM framework which&#13;
provides the data basis for input-output analysis. It is obtained from the&#13;
complete SAM by consolidation of all the accounts 1 to 8 which therefore&#13;
appear in much reduced form as the first row and column of the table. Full&#13;
detail is retained for accounts 9 and 10, however (i.e. for commodities and&#13;
production activities), while the indirect tax account (account 11) is also&#13;
retained in its original form.&#13;
The upper part of Table 5.1 shows definitions for each element of&#13;
this reduced data format while the second panel gives an algebraic expression&#13;
for these same details which is to be used in subsequent arguments. But&#13;
before coming to them the implications of a rather obvious point can be&#13;
noted. The point is that because Table 5.1 is a reduced version of the full&#13;
SAM it contains less information and therefore gives a less detailed picture&#13;
of the economy. The detail that is retained shows total costs and revenues&#13;
for each activity and total demands and supplies for each commodity. The&#13;
interrelation between activities and commodities is also retained. The matrix&#13;
Tc.a  (which is matrix   T  10   in the notation of Table 2.3) shows details of&#13;
commodity purchases by activities and hence records intermediate inputs into&#13;
production. This matrix is known in the literature as the technology&#13;
matrix.   It is complemented by matrix   Ta c  (i.e.   T   9  in Table 2.3) which&#13;
is known as the make matrix since it shows the receipts by each activity from&#13;

CHAPTER 5&#13;
PRODUCTION AND COMMODITY ACCOUNTS&#13;
5.1 Social Accounts and the Data Basis for Input-Output Analysis&#13;
In this chapter the compilation of accounts for commodities and&#13;
activities is described. Since our conceptual approach to these accounts&#13;
differs quite fundamentally from SNA methodology, discussion of the&#13;
differences precedes the numerical presentation and provides much of the&#13;
subject matter of this section and Sections 5.2 and 5.3 also.&#13;
Accounts which provide a data basis for input-output analysis are a&#13;
component part of any SAM. Indeed, as mentioned in the introduction to this&#13;
report, the matrix approach to social accounting may be considered, at least&#13;
in part, to be an outgrowth from the input-output system and its historical&#13;
antecedents. The most elementary treatment of the balance of demand and&#13;
supply for different commodities in the economy is characterized by the&#13;
situation where the production accounts simply comprise a set of accounts for&#13;
each industry. In this case a one-to-one correspondence is defined between&#13;
industries and their products, so that all of the domestic supply of a&#13;
commodity comes from a particular industry. The principal drawback with this&#13;
approach is that the correspondence between industries and their products is&#13;
not always one-to-one; that is to say, industries frequently produce more than&#13;
one product, no matter how the industry classification is defined.&#13;
The SNA has adopted a convention, first developed by Stone for the&#13;
Cambridge Growth Model41/ of distinguishing between industries and the&#13;
1/ Cambridge, Department of Applied Economics (1962-), Vol. 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
commodities which they produce. In this approach the classifications used to&#13;
define industries are usually the same as those used to classify&#13;
commodities. Production establishments are then grouped into industries&#13;
according to whichever commodity group their principal product(s) fall&#13;
within. In such a system there are just as many industries as there are&#13;
commodities; industries produce mainly the commodities from which they take&#13;
their name; and there is secondary production by each industry of commodities&#13;
other than the principal product. This approach has been relaxed in our&#13;
Malaysia SAM to allow greater flexibility in the definition of industries and&#13;
commodities.&#13;
Our starting point is to group production establishments into&#13;
production activities rather than into industries defined by the products&#13;
produced. This allows several flexibilities in determining the flows in the&#13;
production accounts. Not least of these is the ability to classify&#13;
establishments according to their technological or institutional&#13;
characteristics (for example, small-scale as opposed to large-scale, or&#13;
formal/informal, etc.) rather than exclusively according to the commodities&#13;
they produce. The distinction still allows secondary productionl/ to be&#13;
embraced within the accounting system, as will shortly be seen. Thus,&#13;
activities can still produce more than one commodity, just as each commodity&#13;
can be produced by more than one activity. Meanwhile, our scheme allows&#13;
different activities to produce the same commodity, but in different ways.&#13;
And more generally there is no presumption that the number of activities and&#13;
1/ That is, production of commodities other than the principal product(s) of&#13;
an activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
would be a more relevant structuring of production activities with respect to&#13;
the most pressing economic policy issues than any conceivable 107 (or 108)&#13;
sector breakdown based on commodities alone. The issues here do not concern&#13;
the commodity detail that is collected from primary sources. Rather, the&#13;
concern is with the tabulations prepared from this detail as working documents&#13;
for policy analysis.&#13;
If some such approach to activity statistics had been implemented for&#13;
Malaysia, our problems of SAM construction would have been eased. The&#13;
important distinction between monetary and non-monetary transactions within&#13;
the accounts could be tackled more readily from this starting point, while the&#13;
interaction between factor and activity classifications would become more&#13;
meaningful as technological and locational dimensions emerged more clearly.&#13;
Such comment raises issues on which future research might concentrate. For&#13;
now it can only be regretted that thus far we have made no headway in this&#13;
direction.&#13;
To conclude this chapter on a more mundane point, which is&#13;
nonetheless important, it is apparent that the results in Chapters 3 and 4&#13;
and, indeed, the whole SAM approach depends crucially on having available a&#13;
multipurpose household survey of the quality of the HES. Malaysia is perhaps&#13;
as unique in this respect as it is in the detail and methodology of its&#13;
National Accounts. Few countries have such excellent primary sources. It is&#13;
therefore somewhat unreasonable to add that a relatively minor improvement in&#13;
coverage would have proved most helpful. This is to include a detailed&#13;
breakdown of employment and factor payments either in the Financial Survey of&#13;
Companies or preferably in the annual National Accounts enquiries. The&#13;
matrix T2.9 is the starting point from which one set of data sources takes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -&#13;
off in the direction of income and outlay accounts, while another data set&#13;
moves toward production costs, raw material transactions and commodity&#13;
balances. For these data sources to overlap in providing details for matrix&#13;
T2.9 would be a great step towards their reconciliation, and hence towards&#13;
estimation of a consistent SAM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
sales of different commodities. Hence the make matrix shows which commodities&#13;
are made by each activity. In this way full detail on the interrelations&#13;
between commodities and activities is retained in Table 5.1. What is lost is&#13;
detail on factor markets and income distribution both among households and&#13;
between them and other institutions. It follows that input-output can provide&#13;
only a partial analysis of what is happening in an economy and the full SAM is&#13;
needed as a basis for a more comprehensive and consistent treatment.&#13;
Since Table 5.1 is a SAM (obtained by consolidation of our full SAM&#13;
framework) it follows that corresponding row and column totals must be&#13;
equal. Moreover, given equality of corresponding row and column totals for&#13;
all but one account, then the remaining account must also balance. In what&#13;
follows the consolidated account which forms the first row and column of the&#13;
table will be treated as such a residual, i.e. its balance is to be guaranteed&#13;
by ensuring that all other accounts are in balance. This means that the&#13;
requirement%t&#13;
(5.1)    i'f  _   m'i  +  v'i  +   Y cTc  +  YraTa&#13;
can be assumed to be satisfied, given that the balance equations for the rest&#13;
of the system are satisfied. The identity (5.1) is therefore of no further&#13;
interest in our discussion beyond noting its interpretation which follows from&#13;
the definition of notation given in Table 5.1. Since m' is a row vector of&#13;
the imports of each commodity (valued c.i.f.), it follows that m'i is the&#13;
total cost of imports. Similarly, v' is the row vector of value added by&#13;
each production activity. Hence v'i is total value added. From row (or&#13;
1/ For notational conventions see the note to Table 5.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
column) 11, it can be seen that   y' Tc + y'aTa   is the total of indirect&#13;
taxes.  The composition of this term is discussed below.    Meanwhile it is&#13;
established that the identity (5.1) reads&#13;
IImportl         Value         Rndirectl           Total&#13;
(5.2)    c.i.f.|    +    Added    +    LTaxes              Final&#13;
Expenditure&#13;
where total final expenditure, i.e. the column sum of the consolidated&#13;
account, is given by   i'f&#13;
The fact that indirect taxes appear on the left-hand side of (5.2)&#13;
implies that total final expenditures in our system are valued at market&#13;
prices. This is an important point which is at variance with SNA&#13;
conventions. It is elaborated in the next section. For now it is sufficient&#13;
to note that the column vector f records final demand expenditures for each&#13;
commodity as a single number. Such numbers accumulate from the consolidation&#13;
of accounts 1 to 8 and therefore record the sum, by commodity, of (i)&#13;
consumption expenditures (i.e. wants for private consumption plus public&#13;
consumption); (ii) domestic investment expenditures on both fixed assets and&#13;
increases in stocks; and (iii) exports, which are valued f.o.b. in our system.&#13;
The total demand for each commodity is recorded in Table 5.1 as&#13;
distinct elements of the column vector    yc . Summation of the commodity&#13;
accounts by rows therefore gives the-identity&#13;
(5.3)    y       f  +  T  i&#13;
where f is the column vector of final commodity demands as previously&#13;
discussed. Intermediate commodity demands are recorded by the technology&#13;
matrix  Tc.a   which has row sums   Tca i . A typical element of this matrix&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
The three SAMs which are represented in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 are all&#13;
related. The row and column labels used in Table 5.2 are identical to those&#13;
in Table 5.1 and the amount of detail is also the same. It follows that the&#13;
steps from Table 5.1 to Table 5.2 do not involve any changes in levels of&#13;
disaggregation and the same names can be used for individual accounts.&#13;
However, actual cell entries in the tables do change so that the&#13;
interpretation of both cell entries and account names is affected.&#13;
In broad terms the general characteristics of these alternative SAM&#13;
formats is as follows. We have already seen that Market Price SAM as set out&#13;
in Table 5.1 shows commodity transactions valued at market, or purchaser's,&#13;
prices. Accordingly, each commodity is valued inclusive of (i) all indirect&#13;
taxes levied on that commodity (commodity taxes), and also of (ii) all&#13;
transport and distribution charges payable by the user. Factor Cost SAM,&#13;
shown in the first panel of Table 5.2, differs from Market Price SAM in that&#13;
commodities are no longer valued inclusive of commodity taxes levied on their&#13;
use. Instead, commodity taxes are shown as a separate payment by user to the&#13;
indirect tax account row.   Total commodity taxes   Yc 'T  are therefore split&#13;
in Factor Cost SAM between those levied on fiscal expenditures Tc 'f and&#13;
those levied on intermediate uses   Tc 'T    . The second panel of Table 5.2&#13;
cc.a&#13;
takes the question of margins one stage further by showing commodities valued&#13;
at basic (or 'ex-factory') prices. According to this system, purchasers of a&#13;
particular commodity typically buy some trade and transport services as a&#13;
separate (complementary) commodity: and in addition they must pay whatever&#13;
commodity taxes are due to the indirect tax accounts as in Factor Cost SAM.&#13;
The precise nature of the relationships between these alternative&#13;
SAMs will be derived in this section. The derivations are presented in two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
stages: first, Factor Cost SAM is discussed in relation to Market Price SAM,&#13;
and then SNA SAM is obtained from Factor Cost SAM. In each case a first step&#13;
is to check that the SAMs in Table 5.2 are legitimate, i.e. that they are&#13;
internally consistent in the sense that their row and column sums correspond&#13;
exactly. A second and more significant step is to show the irreversability of&#13;
the derivations, i.e. that while it is possible to go from Market Price SAM to&#13;
Factor Cost SAM, and hence to SNA SAM, this process is not reversable.&#13;
Accordingly, Market Price SAM, which is a special case of our Malaysia SAM&#13;
scheme, is the most fundamental of the three alternative systems.&#13;
Legitimacy of Factor Cost SAM is easily established. Compared with&#13;
our Market Price SAM in Table 5.1, the first and third rows of Factor Cost SAM&#13;
are identical, so that no changes are involved in these accounts. With&#13;
respect to the second row, the mathematical operation is to premultiply the&#13;
commodity accounts by   (I - Tc)  . This creates deficits in the first, third&#13;
and totals columns of   T' f , t'' T    and   y' ¶   respectively.  To balance&#13;
c      c c.a          c c&#13;
the first three accounts therefore requires the addition of     ' cf  to the&#13;
first entry of the fourth row; the subtraction of    y' cTc  from the second&#13;
entry; and the addition of   T' Tc,a  to the third entry.   With these changes&#13;
the translation from Market Price to Factor Cost SAM are accomplished, and&#13;
Factor Cost SAM is legitimate because, given the balance of its first three&#13;
rows and columns, the fourth row and column must balance automatically.&#13;
It is apparent that the difference between Market Price and Factor&#13;
Cost SAMs concerns the treatment of commodity taxes. Specifically, since the&#13;
vector  T C  records proportions of the market value of commodity transactions&#13;
which is due to commodity taxes, the vector T f shows the commodity tax&#13;
c&#13;
element of final demand transactions, while matrix Tr cTc     similarly records&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
5.2 Reconciliation with the SNA&#13;
A point to note about Table 5.1 is that all its elements are&#13;
measurable and can be obtained directly from primary data sources. This is&#13;
obvious with respect to the vectors f , m , v * Yc and Ya and involves&#13;
some advantage over other schemas since both f and Yc are recorded in&#13;
market prices, i.e. in the prices at which such transactions take place.&#13;
Similar remarks apply to the matrices   Tc.a  and  Ta,c . With respect to the&#13;
tax rates  TC  and   ra , measurability follows directly from the fact that if&#13;
the total revenue derived from a particular indirect commodity (or activity)&#13;
tax is known then, given total income or expenditure for that commodity (or&#13;
activity), the corresponding commodity (activity) tax rate is easily derived&#13;
as a ratio.  Hence the vectors   Tc  and Ta   can be determined numerically.&#13;
Given the measurability of Table 5.1 and its algebraic components, it&#13;
follows that any SAM derived from them can also be measured. In particular,&#13;
both of the SAM matrices in Table 5.2 are measurable since they essentially&#13;
involve transformation of the data given in Table 5.1.1/ The second of these&#13;
is of particular interest since it is the SAM format recommended as part of&#13;
the UN SNA. The first SAM in Table 5.2 is an intermediate step from our SAM&#13;
in Table 5.1 to the SNA SAM. It will be referred to as Factor Cost SAM to&#13;
distinguish it from others, while Basic Price SAM is an alternative name for&#13;
the SNA SAM variant.&#13;
1/ The second SAM in Table 5.2 depends on a vector da and a matrix Da.c&#13;
neither of which is defined by Table 5.1. The measurability of these&#13;
components is discussed at a later stage in the text.&#13;

shows the purchases of a commodity by an activity for intermediate use.&#13;
Taking row sums implies aggregation over all activities to give total&#13;
intermediate purchases of each commodity.&#13;
The column summations for commodity accounts yield the identity&#13;
(5.4)    Yc     m  +   Ta.ci      cYc&#13;
This states that the value of total supplies of each commodity has three&#13;
components. The first is imports of each commodity, valued c.i.f.. The&#13;
second is given by the column sums of the make matrix    Ta.c . These represent&#13;
the value of domestic supplies of each commodity, i.e. they are the sum over&#13;
all activities of the value of each commodity produced by each activity. The&#13;
third term,  T yC  , represents indirect taxes on commodities, where a typical&#13;
element of  T    is the proportion of the market price valuation of supplies of&#13;
a commodity which is attributable to an indirect tax on the commodity. Since&#13;
subsidies are treated as a negative indirect tax, it follows that an element&#13;
Of  Tc  corresponding to a commodity which is subsidized will be negative.&#13;
More significantly, the accounts in Table 5.1 record commodity demands and&#13;
supplies at market prices. It is implied, therefore, that if a good is&#13;
subject to differential indirect taxation according to who buys it (or end&#13;
use), then goods destined for different end uses must be distinguished as&#13;
different commodities in our schema.&#13;
Turning now to the activity accounts, row summation yields&#13;
(5-5)    Ya  =   Ta.ci&#13;
Here the column vector Ya records the total revenue of each production&#13;
activity. This is obtained simply by summing the make matrix across rows.&#13;
The revenue of an activity derives from sales of the various commodities it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
produces. Hence summing over commodities yields total revenue for each&#13;
activity.&#13;
Total costs are derived by summing columns for each production&#13;
activity so that&#13;
(5.6)    y      v  +   T'    i  +  TaYa&#13;
Here the first item is value added in each activity, which guarantees row and&#13;
column balance since value added is defined as the difference between total&#13;
revenue and the other components of costs. Identity (5.6) splits these other&#13;
components into two parts. The first is raw material costs, which are&#13;
obtained by forming column sums of the technology matrix    Tc.a . The second&#13;
is indirect taxes on activities, which in the Malaysia SAM reflects items such&#13;
as licenses for trading. These are treated differently in SNA but for&#13;
convenience we have followed Malaysian practice since the treatment is not&#13;
important to our main arguments l/&#13;
Finally, the indirect tax account in row and column 11 collects&#13;
indirect taxes on commodities and activities in row 11, and then pays these&#13;
out in column 11 to government, which is part of the consolidated account for&#13;
accounts 1 to 8. The equivalence of row and column sums of the indirect tax&#13;
account is evidence from the algebra of Table 5.1. Accordingly no explicit&#13;
discssion of this account is needed.&#13;
1/ Malaysia does not have a value added tax. If it did, they would be shown&#13;
as indirect taxes on activities, i.e. in row 11, column 10.&#13;

the commodity tax components of intermediate commodity expenditures. Thus&#13;
(I - T )f  is final demand net of commodity taxes while&#13;
T *      (I -   )Ta     is similarly intermediate commodity transactions net of&#13;
c.a           c   c.a&#13;
commodity taxes.&#13;
In obtaining Factor Cost SAM, commodity tax revenues are shown under&#13;
the expenditure column of each account which buys commodities, rather than as&#13;
an expenditure of commodity accounts. This treatment is a genuine&#13;
alternative, but it has some potential cost. Specifically, while Factor Cost&#13;
SAM can be derived from Market Price SAM, the converse is not true. This is&#13;
because the scalar   T' f  and the vector  y' t  + T'cTc    do not contain&#13;
c                   YaTa       cca&#13;
enough information to recapture the vectors   Tc  and  T a  * Hence one cannot&#13;
derive Market Price SAM from the data in Factor Cost SAM.&#13;
To provide the extra information needed for this reverse process it&#13;
would be necessary to have a separate indirect tax account for each commodity&#13;
tax.  The scalar  T' cf would then be replaced by the vector   f'TC   , and&#13;
similarly for taxes on purchases by activities. Given this fuller&#13;
information, the factor cost and market price variants of SAM are&#13;
interchangeable. We were fortunate that for Malaysia this fuller information&#13;
is available 1/&#13;
The legitimacy of the SNA SAM is mathematically more difficult to&#13;
establish. Compared with Factor Cost SAM, the first and fourth rows of the&#13;
table are unaltered. With respect to the second row, the mathematical&#13;
operation involved is to premultiply by a matrix (I - B) where the matrix B&#13;
is defined in the footnote to Table 5.2 and discussed further below.&#13;
1/ See Section 5.4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
Analogous to the case with commodity taxes, this premultiplying matrix creates&#13;
deficits in the first, third and totals columns of    i'B f* , i'B T*    and&#13;
i'B yc* respectively. However, relative to Factor Cost SAM, SNA SAM shows&#13;
that the column totals for the first and third columns are unaltered. Hence&#13;
the first two of the above terms must be identically zeroil/ It can be shown&#13;
that this is in fact the case since the matrix B has the property i'B = 0 ,&#13;
which means that columns of B sum to zero.&#13;
To establish this property, the vector da and matrix Dac which&#13;
enter into the definition of B need to be considered. The latter is given&#13;
in the footnote to Table 5.2 as&#13;
(5.7)    B  =  {d' T     - D ' T    } I&#13;
a a.c    a.c   a.c   c&#13;
The dimension of da is the number of activities and da is defined to have&#13;
all elements equal to one or zero. Moreover the unit elements are defined to&#13;
correspond to the set of activities which constitute Trade and Transport.&#13;
Thus if there are several activities within the broad category Trade and&#13;
Transport, then da will have unit elements corresponding to these activities&#13;
while all other activities will correspond to zero elements in da . Matrix&#13;
Dac   is now deemed to have the propert 2&#13;
(5.8)    Da.Ci  =   d&#13;
a.c ~a&#13;
which means that   da  is the vector of row sums of   Da,c    Given this&#13;
property, it is relatively easy to show that column sums of B are zero as&#13;
1/ In this event the third term, which is a total, will also be zero.&#13;
2/ Matrix Da.c is discussed in detail at a later stage in the argument.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
required.i/&#13;
To interpret matrix B it can be noted that the row vector&#13;
d'a Ta.c  gives the sum of all trade and transport components of total costs&#13;
for each commodity.   Hence  d I T     y*-1  expresses trade and transport costs&#13;
a a.c c&#13;
as a fraction of total costs (valued at factor cost) for each commodity.     The&#13;
effect of premultiplying the commodity accounts row of Factor Cost SAM by&#13;
I - B is therefore in part to remove the trade and transport costs component&#13;
from each commodity. The remainder, which now excludes trade and transport,&#13;
is known as basic costs. The second component of I - B is shown by (5.7) to&#13;
be  D ' T      y *-1  . This adds back the trade and transport cost components&#13;
a.c a.c c&#13;
of commodity purchases as purchases of trade and transport services, i.e. as&#13;
purchases of the commodities which trade and transport activities supply.&#13;
This follows from the fact that    Tac YC 1    is simply the matrix   Ta.c&#13;
scaled down by columns.   Specifically, elements of Tac YC *-1    are&#13;
proportions: they are the proportion of the total domestic supply of a&#13;
particular commodity which is produced by a particular activity. It follows&#13;
that if  z   is some commodity demand vector, then   Ta.c Y     z  is a derived&#13;
vector which shows the contribution of each activity to supplying z.&#13;
Premultiplying by   da  picks out those elements of this derived vector which&#13;
refer to trade and transport activities.    Hence  da T     yClz    is the&#13;
a a.c c&#13;

vector of derived demands on trade and transport activities which results from&#13;
the factor cost commodity demand vector z .&#13;
To go from activity demands to commodity demands requires the&#13;
distributive matrix Da.c . This has dimensions equal to the total number of&#13;
activities times the total number of commodities. It is defined such that&#13;
every element in a row for some activity which is not part of Trade and&#13;
Transport is zero, and every element in a column which refers to a commodity&#13;
which is not a part of Trade and Transport Services is also zero 1/ With&#13;
respect to the rows, the definition implies that    da Da.c   Da.c while (5.8)&#13;
imposes the requirement that the non-zero rows of Da.c must sum to unity.&#13;
This allows non-zero elements of Da.c to be proportions (by rows): a&#13;
particular non-zero row of Da.c takes an expenditure on some trade and&#13;
transport activity and distributes it as expenditures on the Trade and&#13;
Transport Services (i.e. commodities) which that activity supplies. Hence the&#13;
expression&#13;
(5.9)    D' d            *T y z  =D ' T      y *_1 z&#13;
a.c  a  a.c YC            a.c  a.c YC&#13;
takes a commodity expenditure vector z from Factor Cost SAM and first&#13;
extracts the implied expenditure on each Trade and Transport Activity. These&#13;
implied expenditures are then mapped back as commodity expenditures on Trade&#13;
and Transport services.&#13;
1/ Trivially, with only one Trade and Transport activity and one Trade and&#13;
Transport services commodity, Da,c has a particularly simple structure.&#13;
It contains only one non-zero element (which is unity) at the intersection&#13;
of the row and column for these activity and commodity accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
While the details of premultiplying commodity accounts from Factor&#13;
Cost SAM by I - B are somewhat tortuous, the general principal is relatively&#13;
simple. It is to take any particular commodity expenditure at factor cost and&#13;
then split this up so that it is expressed as a joint expenditure on the&#13;
commodity in question and on Trade and Transport Services. Since the&#13;
'splitting up' is entirely within the commodity accounts, i.e. it is between&#13;
commodities, there is no leakage of income from these accounts so that total&#13;
demands aggregated over all commodities are unaffected. This is reflected&#13;
formally in the result i'B = 0 . However, the effect of redistributing&#13;
expenditures within the accounts is to change the nature of what we mean by a&#13;
commodity and hence to imply that demands for commodities are joint demands.&#13;
In Market Price SAM, commodities are located at the point of sale and&#13;
indirect taxes have been paid (by the commodity accounts). In Factor Cost SAM&#13;
the location is the same but indirect taxes are outstanding. Thus any&#13;
purchaser must pay both for the commodity and for any indirect tax on it. In&#13;
Basic Price SAM the location is now shifted back to the point of origin.&#13;
Hence to acquire the commodity steel, the purchaser must buy steel at point of&#13;
origin (i.e. imports c.i.f. or ex-factory); they must also buy some trade and&#13;
transport services to move the steel to point of use; and they must finally&#13;
pay any indirect tax on steel. Thus the amount being paid out is the same in&#13;
each system, but its treatment by rows is different. The commodity 'steel' is&#13;
something different in each system and, in particular, within the SNA system&#13;
market demand for steel is a joint demand for the commodity steel (at point of&#13;
origin) and for some other commodity(ies), viz. Trade and Transport services,&#13;
to move the steel to point of use.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -&#13;
At this stage in the argument, legitimacy of SNA SAM requires only&#13;
that the new make-matrix Ta.c** should have row sums equal to Ya (since&#13;
column sums for production activities are not changed by premultiplying&#13;
Tc.a* by (I - B ), and that the column sums of Ta.c** should be equal to&#13;
y *' (I - B') - m' to preserve the full balance of the table.&#13;
The required condition for row sums can be demonstrated directly,/&#13;
given the definition of Ta.c** in Table 5.2 as&#13;
(5.10)   Ta.c**   =  (I - da) Ta.c  +  Ya Da.c&#13;
With respect to column sums it is useful to note that (5.10) defines&#13;
Tac** in two parts.    Premultiplying by   I - da  leaves elements of   Ta.c&#13;
unchanged if they are not in a trade and transport activity row. If they are,&#13;
then such elements are set equal to zero. So, with the exception of Trade and&#13;
Transport activities,   Tac**   is the same as   Ta.c . And for trade and&#13;
transport activities, the rows of Ta.c are replaced by new rows defined by&#13;
Y Da.c , i.e. by keeping the former row sums and redistributing them across&#13;
rows according to the proportions given by    Da.c&#13;
It follows from this description that moving from Ta.c to Ta.c**&#13;
involves a loss for column sums given by the Trade and Transport activity&#13;
elements of Ta.c , and a gain given by the corresponding elements of&#13;
Y  Dac . The net loss (as a row vector) is therefore&#13;
(5.11)   i'd   T    - i'y  D     -   da' T    _Y' D&#13;
a  a.c       a  a.c      a   a.c     a   a.c&#13;
1/  From (5.10) row sums are given by    Tac   i - (I - da) Ta   i + ya Da  i.&#13;
But  T   i = y   and D   i = d , so T      i = (I - d ) y   + y d&#13;
a.c     a       a.c     a      a.c             a   a    aa&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
and can be shown to be equal to   yc'*B' -1    Hence column sums of the&#13;
commodity accounts are decreased by y c'* B' (which sums to zero) as required&#13;
for the legitimacy of SNA SAM.&#13;
Having established the legitimacy of SNA SAM and that it involves a&#13;
modification of what is meant by commodities, it remains to be shown (a) that&#13;
SNA SAM can be derived from Factor Cost SAM, and (b) that the process cannot&#13;
be reversed.&#13;
Derivation of SNA SAM follows from the algebra and definitions in&#13;
Table 5.2, given that the matrix Da.c can be obtained. And this is a simple&#13;
matter if there is only one trade and transport service: Da.c then has all&#13;
elements zero except for the column which refers to this service, and which is&#13;
given by the vector da . This is easily generalized for the case of several&#13;
Trade and Transport service commodities produced by at least one Trade and&#13;
Transport service activity, but where such activity produces only one&#13;
commodity. Thus, for example, retail services may be provided by small or&#13;
large scale traders: two separate activities provide only one service in this&#13;
case. The matrix Da.c contains only zeros or ones in this example since&#13;
rows contain at most one non-zero element, and row sums must be equal to da&#13;
as previously discussed.&#13;
It seems reasonable to expect that in most examples a one-to-one&#13;
correspondence might maintain between Trade and Transport and the&#13;
1/ From the definition of B in (5.7) it follows that&#13;
By  = {d ' T    - D ' }i - T ' d  - D ' y . This expression    is&#13;
c     a   a.c    a.c      a.c a    a.c a&#13;
simply the transpose of the right-hand side of (5.11) so that the&#13;
result is established.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -&#13;
type of commodities they produce. In this event that part of Da.c which is&#13;
non-zero would be an identity matrix. Neither this nor the earlier cases&#13;
discussed above create any difficulties in identifying an appropriate&#13;
Da.c . A more complex case arises however, when an activity produces more&#13;
than one Trade and Transport service commodity. In this instance the matrix&#13;
Ta.c is an obvious source of information.&#13;
Within Ta.c the intersection of rows for Trade and Transport&#13;
activities and columns for Trade and Transport service commodities shows&#13;
details of how such services are derived from the output of Trade and&#13;
Transport activities. These elements are retained as the only non-zeros in a&#13;
matrix  d   Ta   d   where  dc  is a vector with dimensions given by the number&#13;
of commodities and has unit elements for each Trade and Transport Service&#13;
(commodity) and is zero otherwise. Hence the non-zero elements of&#13;
da Ta c dc correspond to the non-zero elements of Da c and the latter can&#13;
be obtained from the former by normalizing rows of da Tac d so that the&#13;
non-zero rows sum to unityS      A particular mathematical operation which&#13;
achieves this is to define Da.c as&#13;
(5.12)   D        {(I-d)y      +d   Td}       da T     d&#13;
a.c           aa~   a  a    . a         a,c   c&#13;
so that the generation of SNA SAM from Factor Cost SAM is well defined and&#13;
requires no further information to that obtained in Factor Cost SAM.&#13;
1/ The implicit assumption here is that the mix of Trade and Transport&#13;
services (commodities) produced by activities as shown in Ta.c is&#13;
representative of the total mix of services required for moving goods from&#13;
producers to users.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
It only remains now to show that SNA SAM cannot be used as a data&#13;
basis for derivation of Factor Cost SAM. And this follows from the fact&#13;
that  Ta.c**  does not contain enough information to generate   Ta.c&#13;
Specifically, there is no problem for rows which cover activities other than&#13;
Trade and Transport since these are the same in the two matrices. But for the&#13;
Trade and Transport rows, SNA SAM takes the row detail and compresses it into&#13;
the columns which refer to Trade and Transport services. There is no&#13;
information base within the SNA for recreating the more detailed information&#13;
in Factor Cost SAM.&#13;
The derivation of commodity and activity accounts for Market Price&#13;
SAM is discussed in Sections 5.4 et seq. which follow. From the above&#13;
arguments it is clear that these required supplementary information to that in&#13;
the SNA and we were fortunate in having this available for Malaysia. However,&#13;
before coming to the detailed numerical information, the next section&#13;
addresses some issues which are raised by the discussion so far. In&#13;
particular, why do the SNA recommendations take this particular form, and what&#13;
are the arguments for and against the alternative treatments?&#13;
5.3 Input-Output Analysis and Model Applications&#13;
Previous arguments have established that Market Price SAM can be used&#13;
to derive SNA SAM but not vice versa; and it has been suggested that Market&#13;
Price SAM is preferable in the sense that its elements correspond directly to&#13;
market transactions and hence to primary data, while SNA SAM involves&#13;
subsequent manipulation of the data. On both counts Market Price SAM seems&#13;
preferable, and it will be maintained here that Market Price SAM is the more&#13;
general system. The only issues therefore concern whether this extra&#13;
generality is worth having and at what cost it is obtained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -&#13;
The costs have nothing to do with data collection since SNA SAM and&#13;
Market Price SAM require the same basic information, i.e. the same numbers&#13;
need to be collected in each case since surveys and censuses can only obtain&#13;
reliable information on actual transactions, i.e. on transactions at market&#13;
prices. It follows that in practice computation of SNA SAM begins implicitly&#13;
with Market Price SAM and then goes through the manipulations which have been&#13;
described in the previous section.   This suggests an advantage for Market&#13;
Price SAM in avoiding some of this manipulative work.&#13;
The advantage of SNA SAM over Market Price SAM is that the former can&#13;
involve fewer commodities.   To take an example, rice which is consumed by&#13;
cultivator households must be treated in Market Price SAM as a separate&#13;
commodity to rice which is sold in the urban market. Both types of rice can&#13;
be assumed to start out as the same good. But rice for the urban market&#13;
requires additional inputs from the transport sector to move it to an urban&#13;
area, and further inputs from Distribution to channel it through to retail&#13;
outlets. Thus one would expect rice in urban markets to cost more and, from&#13;
the point of view of production inputs, it is a different commodity to the&#13;
rice which a cultivator does not market but rather retains for consumption by&#13;
his family. In this example, from the point of view of Market Price SAM we&#13;
have two distinct commodities which require separate treatment. But for SNA&#13;
SAM both types of rice are the same and therefore can be included in a common&#13;
account. This is because two commodities are identical in SNA SAM if they are&#13;
the same in basic values, i.e. if the differences between them are&#13;
attributable to differences in Trade and Transport' inputs.'''The advantage of&#13;
SNA SAM is therefore that the commodity accounts within it are simpler.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
This relative simplicity has its costs. One of our general tenets is&#13;
that every economic model has its accounting frameworki-/ and while the&#13;
accounting framework does not fully define a model, it does delimit a class of&#13;
model and therefore impose restrictions on the type of model which can be&#13;
entertained. In these terms the difference between Market Price SAM and SNA&#13;
SAM can be expressed as a difference in the type of models which can be&#13;
supported by them.&#13;
SNA SAM is an entirely adequate data basis for fixed price (fixed&#13;
coefficient) models of the input-output type. It is inadequate for models in&#13;
which prices are endogenous and actual transactions are sensitive to relative&#13;
prices. To justify this statement it is necessary to consider only the first&#13;
step from a SAM to a model, and this is to assume that each commodity is sold&#13;
at the same price whoever may buy it (otherwise it is a different commodity),&#13;
and that the output of each activity is priced the same independent of the use&#13;
to which it is put. These are not very strong assumptions and are common to&#13;
the vast majority of models. Nevertheless, they are assumptions. It follows&#13;
that while all previous equations have in fact been identities, imposition of&#13;
the homogenous price assumptions moves us into the area of postulate&#13;
relationships as opposed to certainties.&#13;
For Market Price SAM, the identities (5.3) to (5.6) define the&#13;
accounting balances for commodity and activity accounts. These can be written&#13;
in an alternative form as:&#13;
(5.13)   from (5.3)                 Yc  =  f + PC Cc,a qa&#13;
1/ This is a dictum first enunciated by Keynes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
(5.14)   from (5.5)                 Ya      Pa Cac q&#13;
(5.15)   from (5.4)                 Yc   =  m + q  C:.  p  + T Y&#13;
(5.16)   and from (5.6)             Ya      v + q  Cc:a PC + TaYa&#13;
(5.17)   where                      PC CC    q      TC.&#13;
(5.18)   and                        Pa Ca.c qc      Ta.c&#13;
Thus the matrices Cc.a and Ca.c are derived from Tc.a and Ta.c by&#13;
assuming that there are well defined price vectors for commodities, PC , and&#13;
for activities, Pa , with corresponding quantity vectors, qc and qa&#13;
respectively. Hence (5.17) implies that a typical element of Cc.a shows the&#13;
quantity of a particular commodity (the row designation) which is used per&#13;
unit of physical output by a particular activity (the column designation).&#13;
Similarly a typical element of Ca.c shows the quantity of output of an&#13;
activity (the row designation) which goes into the generation of a unit of&#13;
supply of a particular commodity (the column designation). Thus elements of&#13;
Cca and Ca.c are ratios of quantities, but there is no presumption that&#13;
those ratios are fixed, e.g. by technology.&#13;
Having defined price and quantity vectors, these must be consistent&#13;
with the SAM and this requires that&#13;
(5.19)                      PC qc      YC&#13;
(5.20)   and                Pa q       Y&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150 -&#13;
i.e. that incomes (or expenditures) should equal prices times quantities. The&#13;
homogeneous price assumption can now be invoked to further manipulate&#13;
identities (5.13) to (5.16). Specifically, these four identities can be&#13;
premultiplied by   p   , Pa      q    and  qa    respectively to yield&#13;
qc                     c         qc&#13;
(5.21)   where    F         =     c+&#13;
(5.23)   and      l::]         'L          c   j =::       +[J&#13;
(5.24)   where             ,m&#13;
(5.25)   and          u                                    + qa&#13;
Equation (5.21) derives from (5.13), (5.14) and the restrictions&#13;
(5.19) and (5.20). It gives an equation in q. and qa which can be solved&#13;
for given coefficient matrices    Cc a  and  Ca c  and a vector   *  which is&#13;
defined by (5.22).   From this definition it is apparent that    *  expresses&#13;
final demand in quantity units, i.e. it is obtained by deflating the money&#13;
expenditures f by prices. Thus (5.21) is closely akin to the basic Leontief&#13;
quantity equation: the two are the same if it is assumed that elements&#13;
ofCc.a and Ca.c are fixed numbers independent of prices.&#13;
Equation (5.23) is also similar to the Leontief price equation. It&#13;
is obtained from (5.15) and (5.16) together with the restrictions (5.19) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -&#13;
(5.20). The vectors p and u which enter (5.23) are defined in (5.24) and&#13;
(5.25) respectively as import costs per unit of supply of each commodity; and&#13;
as factor costs (or value added) per unit of output of each activity.&#13;
Equations (5.21) and (5.23) are the respective quantity and price&#13;
equations which follow from Market Price SAM. As previously noted, prices&#13;
include allowance for indirect taxes and there is no presumption that Cc.a&#13;
and  Ca c are fixed - they can, for example, be sensitive to relative prices&#13;
as given by  Pa  and   Pc . Similarly, final demands   4  can be sensitive to&#13;
relative prices as can p    , and a model may allow  u  to vary with the scale&#13;
of production. Such relationships only serve to complement equations (5.21)&#13;
and (5.23) which meanwhile maintain for all models which are consistent with&#13;
Market Price SAM.&#13;
Moving from Market Price to Factor Cost SAM potentially modifies the&#13;
price and quantity equations as given by (5.21) and (5.23). In place of&#13;
(5.13) the row summation of commodity accounts for Factor Cost SAM gives&#13;
(5.26)   yc      (I   T c)f + (I - Tc)T c.ai&#13;
which is consistent with (5.3) provided that&#13;
(5.27)   yc*     (I    C) yc&#13;
The corresponding column summation gives&#13;
(5.28)   yc*     m + Ta:c i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -&#13;
and this is also consistent with the analogous equation for Market Price SAM&#13;
provided the condition (5.27) is satisfied.&#13;
Row and column summation for the activity accounts in Factor Cost SAM&#13;
yield a vector   y * which is given by&#13;
(5.29)       for rows       ya*  =     T  i&#13;
and for columns    y *     v + T*'  i + ry   + T'    T&#13;
a           c.a       aya    c.a  c&#13;
(5.30)                              V + Tc.a i + TaYa&#13;
These identities correspond to (5.5) and (5.6) for Market Price SAM provided&#13;
only that!/&#13;
(5.31)   ya*      ya&#13;
It follows that if prices and quantities in Factor Cost SAM are given&#13;
by  p* ) Pa* , qc*    and  qa*  then these will be consistent with the results&#13;
(5.21) and (5.23) for Market Price SAM given only that&#13;
(5.32)   y * =   PC* qC*      (I - Tc) Pc&#13;
and&#13;
(5.33)   Ya*  =  Pa* qa*      Pa qa&#13;
1/ This condition is trivial since (5.29) and (5.30) define Ya* as being&#13;
equivalent to the Ya in Table 5.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -&#13;
Clearly there are a great many solutions for the vectors    PC*    a P* a  qc*&#13;
and q * which satisfy (5.32) and (5.33). However, for the most part these&#13;
alternatives are essentially irrelevant and for activities they simply reflect&#13;
the fact that there can be an arbitrary choice of units for measuring either&#13;
prices or quantities. It is more interesting to note, therefore, that (5.32)&#13;
and (5.33) are consistent with the relationships&#13;
(5.34)           =  [::]    ;L::1        =  [&#13;
qa           a          Pa         _     a&#13;
which can be used to derive prices and quantities for a model based on Factor&#13;
Cost SAM from the prices and quantities obtained via Market Price SAM, i.e.&#13;
from (5.21) and (5.23). Indeed, the only change is with respect to commodity&#13;
prices which in Factor Cost SAM are market prices net of indirect commodity&#13;
taxes.&#13;
The alternative procedure of solving directly for    p *    a P* a  q *&#13;
and qa* from identities (5.26), (5.28), (5.29) and (5.30) is a&#13;
possibility. Following through parallel steps to those which yield (5.21) and&#13;
(5.23) from (5.3) to (5.6), two equations analogous to (5.21) and (5.23) can&#13;
be obtained.   These will give solutions for   p c* c Pa* , qc*  and  q a*  which&#13;
can then be made to yield solutions for    p    pa , q   and   q   according to&#13;
(5.34). However, this approach has two disadvantages. First, from (5.34) it&#13;
is apparent that the vector   TC  must be known before   Pc   can be obtained&#13;
from p * . It has already been noted that Factor Cost SAM does not&#13;
necessarily provide this information. And if it does not, then Pc cannot be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154 -&#13;
obtained, so that Factor Cost SAM is inadequate for models in which parameters&#13;
vary with  Pc     I En other words, the direct approach based on Factor Cost SAM&#13;
is adequate only for fixed price models. In this case the results obtained&#13;
for  q *  and  qa*   can be seen from (5.34) to be no different from those for&#13;
q   and  q   given by Market Price SAM as in (5.21).   Thus Factor Cost SAM is&#13;
a useful simplification of Market Price SAM only when the purpose is to&#13;
provide a data base for calculating quantity effects via a fixed price model.&#13;
This result on the limitations of Factor Cost SAM as a basis for&#13;
price endogenous models ia true a fortiori for Basic Price SAM also since&#13;
Factor Cost occupies an intermediate position between Market and Basic Price&#13;
SAMs. The fact that Basic Price SAM does not give explicit details on the&#13;
Trade and Transport margins which are involved in delivering goods to&#13;
alternative markets implies that market prices cannot be captured by&#13;
the system. It follows that the system cannot be used as a basis for models&#13;
in which behaviour is a function of market prices.&#13;
For a more explicit examination of SNA SAM, the four equations which&#13;
define accounting totals for receipts and expenditures of commodity and&#13;
activity accounts can be obtained from Table 5.2 as:&#13;
(5.35)             yc**      (I - B)f* + (I - B) T   *&#13;
c                             c .a&#13;
(5.36)             Ya    E   Ta ** i&#13;
(5.37)             yc*       m + Ta  **'i&#13;
(5.38)   and       y**       v + Tca*   (I'- B)'i +Taya + T c.a  Tc&#13;
where  y **   is the vector of total incomes and outlays for commodity&#13;
accounts, and  y **   is similarly defined for activities.  It can now be shown&#13;
that these four identities are consistent with the identities (5.26), (5.28),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 155 -&#13;
(5.29) and (5.30) for Factor Cost SAM, and hence ultimately are consistent&#13;
with the input-output relations (5.21) and (5.23), provided only thatl'&#13;
(5*39)   y **   =  (I - B)yc*    and   Ya     =   a&#13;
Hence if the conditions (5.39) are satisfied by price and quantity vectors&#13;
defined for Basic Price SAM, then input-output methods applied to Basic Price&#13;
SAM yield results which are consistent with those for Factor Cost SAM.&#13;
Imposing (5.39) on prices and quantities in Basic Price SAM implies&#13;
that&#13;
(5.40)              y**       PC** qC**      (I   B) pc* qc&#13;
and&#13;
(5.41)              Ya        Pa   qa        Pa* qa&#13;
where double asterisks refer to variables from Basic Price SAM and single&#13;
asterisks to the corresponding variables in Factor Cost SAM.&#13;
1/Given (5.39), identity (5.35) follows directly from (5.26). To establish&#13;
consistency of (5.36) and (5.29), note from the definition of      Ta.c    that&#13;
**       **            ^          A                  A      A               *&#13;

Similarly, with respect to (5.37),&#13;
** 1J                 I                          *&#13;
T       i E T    i - T     d + D    y = T     i     - B y .  Therefore&#13;

YC  E Ta.c i + m - By    E (I - B)y     from (5.28).   Finally, consistency&#13;
of (5.38) and (5.30) requires that      T  ai E T       (I - B) i + T     t&#13;
c.a       c.a                c.a  c&#13;

given that   y a       y  But Tc a  (I-B) i ET      (   - T )  so that the&#13;
result follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -&#13;
It is quite clear from (5.40) and (5.41) that for given values of the&#13;
variables in Factor Cost SAM, many alternative solutions for      p ** , pa ** &#13;
q **  and   q **  can be obtained.    However, the simplest possibility is to&#13;
have&#13;
q   q            p            ~~~~~~~(I - B)p&#13;
(5.42)&#13;
qa            qa           Pa               Pa&#13;
so that only commodity prices change in the shift from Factor Cost SAM to&#13;
Basic Price SAM. And this change in prices corresponds to removing the Trade&#13;
and Transport margin from the factor cost price of each commodity. Such&#13;
prices are defined as basic prices in the UN SNA.&#13;
Equations (5.42) and (5.34) link prices in SNA SAM to the input-&#13;
output price equation (5.23) derived from Market Price SAM. Moreover, since&#13;
neither (5.42) nor (5.34) changes the definition of quantities, the input-&#13;
output quantity equation (5.21) derived from Market Price SAM can be&#13;
maintained unchanged through the sequence of SAMs considered here. It follows&#13;
directly from these results that corresponding to (5.21) and (5.23) the&#13;
quantity and price equations for Basic Price SAM are consistent with&#13;
qc            qc            I      -c.a      - &#13;

(5.44)                                                            -C&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
Hence solution in terms of basic prices can be obtained. However, the direct&#13;
approach to input-output relationships, starting with SNA SAM, leads to&#13;
equations for  q c**   qa**   p c**  and  p a**  which are different from&#13;
equations (5.43) and (5.44). The solutions of these latter equations are&#13;
consistent with (5.43) and (5.44) as the earlier arguments require. But their&#13;
form does not allow the market price commodity vector,   pc , to be obtained&#13;
from the basic price vector   Pc** . Accordingly, these equations and the SAM&#13;
from which they derive are not an adequate basis for models in which behaviour&#13;
is sensitive to market prices.&#13;
5.4 Structure and Classifications for Commodity and Activity Accounts&#13;
Previous sections of this chapter have attempted to explain the&#13;
reasons for expressing commodity transactions at market prices in our SAM. It&#13;
has been noted that primary data are typically expressed in these terms and&#13;
that the SNA requirement for commodity transactions to be recorded at basic&#13;
prices implies some extensive data manipulations in going from the primary&#13;
data to final entries in the SNA SAM. These manipulations have been carried&#13;
through in producing the published national accounts and input-output tables&#13;
for Malaysia. Accordingly we have been obliged to undertake the reverse&#13;
manipulations to obtain our Market Price SAM estimates. Subsequent sections&#13;
of this chapter explain the methods adopted to achieve this. As previously&#13;
noted, such a reversing process is not usually possible given only the details&#13;
contained in SNA SAM. It is fortunate, therefore, that available sources for&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia provide extra information which permits the recapture of a&#13;
Market Price SAM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
Reference to Symbolic SAM as set out in Table 2.3 shows that full&#13;
detail on commodity and activity accounts requires the estimation of 10&#13;
matrices  T   ; . It can also be noted that revenue for activities derives&#13;
solely from sales to the commodity accounts as recorded in matrix T10.9 ,&#13;
i.e. through the make matrix. Since this matrix is also a component of the&#13;
outlay accounts for commodities, it can be discussed in either context. Hence&#13;
we are able to organize a complete discussion of commodity and activity&#13;
accounts under three headings which define the content of remaining sections&#13;
of this chapter. Details are as follows:&#13;
Section 5.5:   Final Commodity Demands&#13;
T9.     :    private consumption via wants&#13;
T9.5     :   government consumption&#13;
T9.6         investment&#13;
T9g7     :   exports&#13;
Section 5.6:   Commodity Supplies&#13;
T7.9    :    imports&#13;
T10.9        commodity supplies by activities&#13;
(the make matrix)&#13;
T11.9    :   indirect taxes on commodities&#13;
Section 5.7:   Production Costs of Activities&#13;
T2.10        factor payments x activities&#13;
T9.10   :    commodity purchases x activities&#13;
(the technology matrix)&#13;
T11.10       indirect taxes on activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
Two pedagogical points which can be inferred from this presentation&#13;
schema are worth noting. First, since Section 5.5 is restricted to final&#13;
demand estimates, it follows that there is no discussion of intermediate&#13;
demands at this stage. However, intermediate demand is a component of the&#13;
production costs of activities. Accordingly they can be covered under this&#13;
latter heading, and this is in fact the approach we adopt here. Secondly, and&#13;
more significant in terms of the conceptual framework, it can be noted that&#13;
there are only two points at which the matrices to be discussed in the&#13;
remainder of this chapter have interactions with those discussed in Chapters 3&#13;
and 4. These are the factor payments matrix (T2.10) and the private&#13;
consumption matrix (T9.1) . The former has been discussed in full in Chapter&#13;
4. The latter has not yet been examined in any detail but, when we come to do&#13;
so, the point will be made that column sums of this matrix are given by the&#13;
row sums of matrix T1.3 . In other words, the details of private consumption&#13;
expenditure on commodities are constrained by the demands for different wants&#13;
by different household types as discussed in Chapter 3.&#13;
The fact that these points of contact exist between the subject&#13;
matter of Chapters 3 and 4 and the present concern with commodity and activity&#13;
accounts underlies the general problem of obtaining consistency between data&#13;
for transactions within the different facets of the economy. This is the&#13;
major statistical problem. But it also corresponds to the major conceptual&#13;
issue which lies behind the data, viz. the interconnectedness and causal&#13;
interdependence of income structure (the inter-household and factoral&#13;
distribution of income) and the structure of production and commodity&#13;
balances. Matrices T2.10 and T9.1 lie respectively in the north-east and&#13;
south-west quadrants of our schematic SAM. Input-output analysis links the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -&#13;
two through the commodity and activity accounts. However, we have already&#13;
seen in Chapters 3 and 4 that they are also linked through factor markets and&#13;
the supplies of factor services - which in turn follow from the factor&#13;
endowments of different household types. This second linkage is of equal&#13;
importance to the first. And both need to be understood and reconciled if the&#13;
determinants of welfare, equity and social progress are to be identified.&#13;
From our perspective this is the main reason for wanting to build SAMs.&#13;
In making the link from demand to value added via the production and&#13;
commodity accounts the primary source of information has been the published&#13;
input-output tables l/ These have been supplemented by earlier (unpublished)&#13;
versions of the relevant accounts to facilitate the translation from basic to&#13;
market prices. It should be noted that because these tables provide the basis&#13;
for the revised national accounts for Peninsular Malaysia they are entirely&#13;
consistent with them. This consistency has helped our work considerably.&#13;
The classifications of activities and commodities included in the&#13;
input-output tables have been revised for use in SAM construction. The&#13;
commodity classification involves 59 separate accounts and has been retained&#13;
in its full detail2!/ However the 59 industry accounts have been reduced to&#13;
30 activities for present purposes. In most cases these changes involve&#13;
aggregation of individual industry accounts but in a few instances the change&#13;
is towards further disaggregation. The classification schemes adopted for&#13;
both production activities and commodities are set out in Tables 5.3 and&#13;
1/ Malaysia, Department of Statistics (1975c).&#13;
2/ Apart from an account whose purpose is to receive Bank interest charges&#13;
paid by activities. This does not arise in the commodity balances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161 -&#13;
5.4. These are related to the published input-output tables (with 60&#13;
sectors), and unpublished input-output tables (involving 107 sectors) and the&#13;
industry codings used in the Household Expenditure Survey (HES) in Tables 5.3&#13;
and 5.4 which therefore show concordance between our SAM classifications and&#13;
those in the basic sources I/&#13;
Given the details in Tables 5.3 and 5.4 the reclassification of&#13;
sectors is a straight-forward task. In the process of carrying it through two&#13;
minor discrepancies in the published tables were eliminated fairly easily.&#13;
However, following discussion in the previous sections, the most significant&#13;
statistical objective has been to reformulate the commodity balances so that&#13;
the commodity accounts are valued in market prices (purchasers' values;&#13;
inclusive of trade, transport and indirect taxes), whilst activity output are&#13;
valued in basic prices. This involved recourse to the 107 sector tables which&#13;
contained information on the allocation of trade and transport margins.&#13;
Without this information, a revaluation would have been impossible other than&#13;
by engaging some rather arbitrary assumptions.&#13;
5.5 Final Commodity Demands&#13;
The total demand for commodities is built up from five different&#13;
accounts in the SAM structure. The first four constitute elements of final&#13;
demand while the fifth comprises intermediate demand for raw materials. Only&#13;
the four constitutent elements of final demand are discussed in this section,&#13;
with a treatment of intermediate demand being deferred to Section 5.7.&#13;
1/ Underlying the input-output tables are a series of over 20 sector surveys&#13;
which constitute the primary source.&#13;

The first and most important element of final demand is private&#13;
consumption. This is shown in matrix T9.1 which has rows corresponding to&#13;
the 59 commodities in Table 5.4 while the columns are given by the 34 wants&#13;
between which households distribute their total consumption expendituee as&#13;
discussed in Chapter 3. An estimate of this matrix to basic prices is easily&#13;
obtained from the published 1970 input-output tables for Peninsular Malaysia,&#13;
which show expenditure under each of 34 wants on domestically produced goods,&#13;
and imports.!/ The fact that these are recorded in basic prices implies that&#13;
trade and transport margins on each commodity expenditure under each want are&#13;
shown as a single item of expenditure on a trade and transport commodity_&#13;
Similarly, the tax payments on each commodity are given as a total tax payment&#13;
on all commodity purchases for the same want.&#13;
The domestic and import want requirement matrices available in basic&#13;
prices have been adjusted to obtain a single matrix of total expenditures on&#13;
wants at market prices through a series of steps.&#13;
First, the domestic and import matrices of want requirements in the&#13;
input-output tables were added to form a single matrix. This addition gives a&#13;
59 x 34 wants requirements matrix at basic values. This matrix includes two&#13;
row vectors, one for trade and one for transport, in which each element&#13;
includes the trade margin (or transport margin) on all commoditias within the&#13;
corresponding column. Also obtained from Tables VII and VIII in the input-&#13;
output accounts is a row vector of taxes paid in which each element shows&#13;
1/ See Malaysia, Department of Statistics (1975c) Input-Output Tables for&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia 1970, Tables VII and VIII.&#13;
2/ The margins on both domestic and imported commodities are shown as&#13;
expenditure on the domestically produced commodities, trade and transport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 165 -&#13;
total taxes paid on domestic commodities and imports in the corresponding&#13;
column of the want requirement matrix.&#13;
Next, taking the row vector for taxes shown in Tables VII and VIII of&#13;
the input-output tables, a 59 x 34 matrix of tax payments on each of the&#13;
elements of the wants requirements matrix was formulated. This was achieved&#13;
by converting each element in the row vector of taxes into a column vector of&#13;
59 elements corresponding to estimated tax payments within each want. This&#13;
process involved the use of the unpublished 107 sector input-output tables&#13;
which provide the necessary details. Similarly, each of the two row vectors&#13;
42 and 44 corresponding to trade and transport in the basic value matrix as&#13;
obtained above was expanded into a 59 x 34 matrix showing trade margins and&#13;
transport margins appropriate to each element in the basic value matrix. It&#13;
can be noted that while all the trade component was distributed as margins,&#13;
some positive elements remained in row 44 corresponding to 'pure' purchases of&#13;
transport by households.&#13;
Finally, adding the three matrices reflecting tax payments, trade&#13;
margins and transport margins to the matrix at basic values, a 59 x 34 matrix&#13;
of want requirements at market prices was finally obtained. This matrix is&#13;
shown as part of Table 5.5 (see p.303) which also shows other elements in&#13;
final demand as discussed below.&#13;
Before discussing these other final demand elements it is interesting&#13;
to note that matrix T9 1 can be regarded as a classification converter.&#13;
This terminlogy, which is taken from the Cambridge Growth Project,l/&#13;
accurately captures the simplest role of matrix T9.1 , which is to translate&#13;
1/ See especially Cambridge, Department of Applied Economics (1962-), Vol. 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 166 -&#13;
consumption demand in the categories of a household survey into commodity&#13;
demands expressed in the categories most convenient for interindustry&#13;
analysis. In this spirit matrix T9.1 has a simple, mechanical role.&#13;
However, it can be noted that consumption theoryl/ regards commodities as the&#13;
source of more fundamental objectives such as calories, vitamins, health care,&#13;
shelter, etc. In principle there is no reason why wants may not be defined to&#13;
correspond to these more fundamental objectives. In practice there would be&#13;
major problems to overcome to implement this notion empirically. But it has&#13;
been noted2/ that such an approach offers potentially the best prospect for&#13;
integrating the basic needs aspect of development policy into a SAM framework&#13;
and hence into macro-economic policy.3/ Indeed it is this prospect which,&#13;
given the fundamental importance of basic needs, has led us to designate the&#13;
accounts for Wants as the first set of accounts in our SAM format. Since in&#13;
practice the accounts can be ordered in any desirable way without implication&#13;
for the logic of the structure, the fact that we place Want accounts first is&#13;
simply a statement of our prejudices as to what is most important.&#13;
Table 5.5 shows the final demand contributions from matrices T95 ,&#13;
T9.6 and T9.7 , i.e. Government current consumption, investment and&#13;
exports. Since none of the accounts 5, 6 and 7 is disaggregated in our SAM&#13;
schema, each of these matrices is in fact a vector showing the respective&#13;
final demand contributions on a commodity-by-commodity basis. However, Table&#13;
5.5 shows the investment vector split between gross fixed capital formation&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -&#13;
and stock increases since this dichotomy was readily available from the basic&#13;
sources &#13;
The figures shown in Table 5.5 are obtained relatively easily. In&#13;
each instance final demand vectors in basic prices are directly obtainable&#13;
from the input-output tables 2/ Trade and transport margins present much less&#13;
of a problem in this case. Both the government consumption vector and&#13;
inventory accumulation vector contained no trade or transport margin 3i    The&#13;
vectors for fixed capital formation and exports did contain trade and&#13;
transport margins however. In these cases the unpublished 107 sector input-&#13;
output data was used to distribute the amounts corresponding to trade and&#13;
transport margins across the column vector. Once again there were no 'pure'&#13;
purchases of trade in either fixed investment or exports, although the latter&#13;
did show a pure purchase of the commodity 'transport'. To complete the&#13;
estimates, some final adjustment of the import and export figures was required&#13;
to eliminate a discrepancy between the details published in the input-output&#13;
tables and those in the external transactions account of the national income&#13;
estimates. This adjustment is discussed in Chapter 6, Section 5 and relates&#13;
essentially to tourist expenditures.&#13;
Before leaving the subject of final demand estimates some comment on&#13;
the Government consumption component is in order. As previously noted, since&#13;
Government is not disaggregated in our SAM schema, the matrix T9.5 which&#13;
1/ The vector of stock increases has been used as a convenient depository of&#13;

records Government current expenditure on commodities is simply a column&#13;
vector. However the commodity accounts distinguish various Government&#13;
services so that T9g5 in fact splits Government consumption into current&#13;
expenditures on Education, Medical and Health services, Government economic&#13;
services, Public Administration and Defense, and Government Community and&#13;
Social Services. As will been seen later, these commodity (service) demands&#13;
are supplied by corresponding production activities which in turn buy othe!r&#13;
commodities as intermediate purchases. It is well known that this is an&#13;
alternative treatment to having the institution 'Government' buy factor&#13;
services directly and then showing what, for us, are intermediate commodity&#13;
purchases as the final demand components of Government current expenditure!.&#13;
A less familiar alternative can be illustrated with respect to health&#13;
services. If such services are a basic need then there is considerable&#13;
interest in measuring 'who gets what' as a result of public expenditure on&#13;
them. Neither of the above approaches addresses this question but it is not&#13;
difficult to show that it can be accommodated in principle: and recent work&#13;
by Meerman provides the crucial empirical illustration-I/ The procedure is as&#13;
follows. First, public health service expenditure is shown as an income&#13;
transfer from Government to each household type according to the extent that&#13;
they receive the benefits of such services. Empirically this is not easy, but&#13;
since it directly addresses the crucial question, the difficulties may be&#13;
worth facing. Next, households must be shown as having an expenditure of the&#13;
Want 'public health services' to the extent of the income transfers they&#13;
1/ The general principles are discussed in Pyatt and Thorbecke (1976) while&#13;
Meerman's work, which covers a range of public expenditures, is reported&#13;
in Meerman (1978) and (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
receive. These want expenditures are then recorded in matrix T9 1 as&#13;
demands for the commodity 'public health services.' Thus both the household&#13;
and commodity accounts are kept in balance, but with income and outlays of the&#13;
former at a higher level as a result of the additional transfer income.&#13;
This approach has much to commend it as yet a further step towards&#13;
reorienting national accounts towards the issues of living standards. It in&#13;
no way diminishes the accuracy of major aggregates such as national income.&#13;
But what it does do, as Meerman shows, is take us further towards an&#13;
understanding of equity in the distribution of the national product. The&#13;
approach could not easily be applied to the provision of public goods, such as&#13;
Defense, for which more conventional treatments retain possible. But Meerman&#13;
has shown the feasibility of the method over a wide range of social&#13;
services. It remains for the future to improve our SAM by accommodating his&#13;
results.&#13;
5.6 Commodity Supplies&#13;
The supply side of commodity balances corresponds to column 9 in the&#13;
schematic SAM in Tables 2.1 and 2.3 and consists of a matrix T10.9 which&#13;
sets out the domestic output of commodities by the 30 activities, and two row&#13;
vectors, T7.9 and T11 9 which give total imports of each commodity&#13;
(c.i.f.) and commodity taxes on imports and domestically produced goods.&#13;
The matrix T10.9 has previously been referred to as the make&#13;
matrix. It is of order 30 x 59 and shows in each row the total output of&#13;
various commodities produced by particular activities. It follows that&#13;
columns of this matrix show the contribution of different production&#13;
activities to total domestic supplies of particular commodities. It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 170 -&#13;
important to note that in order to achieve a balance of commodity transactions&#13;
in the economy, the total supply of each commodity at market prices needs to&#13;
be accounted for in our schema. Accordingly the outputs of commodities&#13;
produced by each activity are given in the appropriate column at basic (or ex-&#13;
factory) prices, while row 24 of the matrix records the trade and transport&#13;
margins on each commodity. Thus the trade and transport component of each&#13;
commodity is shown as an input into total supply of the commodity by the trade&#13;
and transport activity. This component also includes trade and transport&#13;
margins on imports. Hence the procedure ensures that column sums for&#13;
commodities are equal to domestic output of the commodity at basic value plus&#13;
imports (c.i.f.) plus the associated trade and transport margins, and plus any&#13;
indirect taxes on the commodity S1 In other words, column sums for commodity&#13;
accounts give total supplies at market prices.&#13;
The main source for matrix T10.9 is Table I of the 1970 Input-&#13;
Output Tables for Peninsular Malaysia which has firstly been aggregated from&#13;
the 60 sectors used in the original to our 30 activities. For the most part&#13;
this simply involved addition of rows (analogous to the case of the technology&#13;
matrix) but there were two instances in which further disaggregation was&#13;
necessary 2/&#13;
1/ Note that row sums give output of each activity at basic value. The row&#13;
sum for activity 24 gives the total output of the trade and transport&#13;
sector distributed across commodities as margins, while the entries in&#13;
columns 42 and 44 represent final demand for trade and transport.&#13;
2/ Once again the preliminary unpublished data for 107 sectors was used and&#13;
the proportions of industry output calculated from this data were appl:Led&#13;
to the aggregate industry row of Table I.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 171 -&#13;
The major adjustment to the 'make 'matrix of the Input-Output&#13;
tables l/ tables has been to distribute the output of trade and transport&#13;
across commodities as described above rather than having' this output recorded&#13;
as single entries in columns 42 and 44 as in SNA SAM. This was done by&#13;
summing the estimated trade and transport margins across columns for each of&#13;
the commodity demand matrices,   T91 , T910 , T9.5 I T9.6     and  T9.7  to&#13;
obtain an estimate of total trade and transport margins on each commodity,&#13;
irrespective of whether it is domestically produced or imported. These&#13;
amounts were then entered in row 24 of matrix T9 10 under the appropriate&#13;
commodity columns. Finally, those parts of the output of trade and transport&#13;
which are consumed as a final good were estimated as the difference between&#13;
total output of trade (transport) as recorded in Table I of the national&#13;
accounts and total trade (transport) margins as estimated above. The&#13;
difference is then entered in column 42 (44) of the matrix T9.10 . The&#13;
results are shown in Table 5.6 (see p.304).&#13;
For commodity taxes and imports (T7.9 and T11.9), details have been&#13;
obtained directly from Table I of the published input-output tables (rows 61&#13;
and 62). Imports are recorded at c.i.f. prices in this source as required in&#13;
our SAM.  Accordingly no adjustment is required2/ and the figures were taken&#13;
directly from the source and are reported in Table 5.6.&#13;
Table 5.6 also records the row vector tg' which has the column sums&#13;
of the commodity accounts as its elements. These figures are therefore our&#13;
1/ Malaysia, Department of Statitics (1975c), Table I.&#13;
2/ Two minor discrepancies in the published figures were eliminated at this&#13;
stage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 172 -&#13;
estimates of commodity supplies at market prices and are consistent with the&#13;
details of demand discussed in the previous section.&#13;
5.7 Production Costs of Activities&#13;
As shown in the schematic SAM, Table 2.1, details of the cost&#13;
structure of activities are given by the three matrices T2.10 , T9.10 and&#13;
T11 10 , which respectively record factor costs, intermediate purchases of&#13;
commodities and indirect taxes on activities. Total costs are then given by&#13;
the sum of these components and must be equal to total revenue as given by the&#13;
row sums of the make matrix T10.9 .&#13;
Details of factor costs have been discussed at length in the previous&#13;
chapter and require no further comment here.&#13;
Turning then to intermediate demand, we need to estimate the matrix&#13;
T9.10 which has previously been referred to as the technology (or absorption)&#13;
matrix. This matrix is of size 59 x 30 and shows the demands for commodities&#13;
purchased for intermediate use at market prices by each of 30 activities. It&#13;
is easily obtained from four of the tables in the input-output accounts.=&#13;
which show separately intermediate flows of domestically produced and imported&#13;
commodities, and the respective tax margins corresponding to these flows.    As&#13;
a first step these four matrices were added together to obtain a matrix of&#13;
intermediate flows (domestic plus imports) at basic values inclusive of tax&#13;
margins. The activities dimension was then reduced from 60 to 30 according to&#13;
the classifications shown in Table 5.3. The resulting matrix contains entries&#13;
in rows 42 and 44 which show not only the direct purchase of trade and&#13;
1/ Tables II, IV, V and VI of the input-output accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173 -&#13;
transport by each activity but also the trade and transport margins on all the&#13;
other commodities purchased as intermediates by the activity. In an analogous&#13;
procedure to that undertaken for the wants requirements matrix, the amount&#13;
corresponding to margins was subtracted from the row elements for trade and&#13;
transport and distributed across the column as a whole. The resulting matrix&#13;
of intermediate flows at market prices is shown in Table 5.7 (see p.305).&#13;
It remains now to discuss indirect taxes on activities which provide&#13;
the details of the 1 x 30 matrix (i.e. a row vector T11.10)&#13;
The elements of T1i10 sum to 366.7. They represent non-commodity&#13;
indirect taxes, such as fees, licences and penalties, and since they can&#13;
neither be allocated to specific commodities, nor treated as direct taxes,&#13;
they are assumed to be taxes levied on activities and paid out prior to&#13;
payments to factors. Our estimates of them are taken directly from the&#13;
published input-output tables. Since they are an element of basic costs in&#13;
our approach, their inclusion in the cost structure of activities implies that&#13;
total costs for each activity in our SAM refer to gross output at basic prices&#13;
inclusive of indirect taxes on activities. Table 5.8 sets out the details of&#13;
the figures adopted.&#13;

CHAPTER 6&#13;
OTHER ACCOUNTS FOR PENINSULAR MALAYSIA&#13;
6.1 The Remaining Accounts&#13;
In the preceding chapters details have been presented covering the&#13;
accounts for Wants (account number 1), Factors (number 2), Households (number&#13;
3), Commodities (number 9), and Activities (number 10). In each instance a&#13;
substantial degree of disaggregation has been attempted within the overall&#13;
constraints set by the official national income estimates, and hence within&#13;
the aggregates presented in Table 2.1. These estimates constitute our major&#13;
subject material for Peninsular Malaysia since we have not disaggregated any&#13;
of the remaining accounts (numbers 4 to 8 and account 11) except in respect of&#13;
their intersection with the accounts discussed in previous chapters. It&#13;
follows that the summary details for all eleven accounts which are given in&#13;
the final section of Chapter 2 provides the fullest information we have for&#13;
accounts 4 to 8 and account 11. The sources and methods used to derive these&#13;
details are discussed in this chapter. Account 4, the Corporate sector&#13;
current account, is discussed in the next section while the Government current&#13;
account, Account 5, is the subject of Section 6.3. Then, in Section 6.4, the&#13;
combined capital account for all domestic institutions (account 6) is&#13;
summarized, drawing on details set out in the earlier discussion and preceding&#13;
chapters. Finally, Section 6.5 discusses the external current and capital&#13;
accounts (accounts 7 and 8) and hence the details of current Balance of&#13;
Payments and capital transfers.&#13;
The above treatment implies no discussion of the indirect tax&#13;
account, account 11, at this stage. This reflects the fact that in a SAM,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176 -&#13;
when all but one account has been fixed, details of the remaining account&#13;
automatically follow. In the present instance all indirect tax receipts&#13;
accrue as income to the Government current account. Their composition has&#13;
been discussed in Chapter 5 as an outlay for commodity and activity&#13;
accounts. There is nothing further to add to these details for account 11.&#13;
A final point to note is that the National Accounts are our primary&#13;
source of data for estimating details of accounts 4 to 8 and 11. Numbers in&#13;
the National Accounts are expressed to the nearest million Malaysian dollars&#13;
and are subject to rounding errors. Our analysis attempts to remove these&#13;
errors by allowing one extra significant digit. This step is taken after the&#13;
figures for these oustanding accounts have been derived as discussed in this&#13;
chapter, i.e. the extra digit is introduced at the stage of reconciling&#13;
results in this chapter with previous results so as to obtain a consistent SAM&#13;
in Table 2.1 which has no rounding errors in it. This seemed to be a&#13;
preferable procedure to presenting Table 2.1 in a form which involved rounding&#13;
errors. But it should be understood that in consequence the last digit in&#13;
that table has no significance.&#13;
6.2 Companies Current Accounts&#13;
The account for companies in Tables 2.1 and 2.3 shows receipts of&#13;
income from three sources: factor income (gross profits arising from domestic&#13;
production and from the rest of the world), transfer income from government,&#13;
and transfer income from the rest of the world. Outgoings from the company&#13;
accounts also include transfer payments; to households in the form of&#13;
distributed profits; to government, largely in the form of direct taxes; and&#13;
to the rest of the world, the latter being payments from domestic companies on&#13;
either a contractual or non-contractual basis, to institutions (persons,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 177 -&#13;
companies or government) in the rest of the world. The entries for corporate&#13;
receipts and payments are set out below.&#13;
Receipts from the Factor accounts consist of receipts from corporate&#13;
capital. As discussed in Chapter 4, corporate capital receives 1719 from&#13;
domestic activities together with 219 from abroad. The total of 1938 is&#13;
distributed to companies as gross profits, / and also to the rest of the world&#13;
current accounts as factor payments abroad. An estimate for the latter can be&#13;
taken directly from the national accounts2/ and is given as 536. The&#13;
remainder of 1402 is therefore the amount paid in to the Companies current&#13;
accounts from the factor accounts.&#13;
Companies also receive 126 from government3/ as 'property income&#13;
payable'. Offsetting this, the Rest of the World accounts show that current&#13;
transfers from overseas sources to domestic sectors other than general&#13;
government amount to 28 4/ But of this total 16 has been assumed to be a&#13;
receipt by non-resident households in order to finance their consumption&#13;
expenditure.!/ The remaining 12 has been treated as an additional receipt by&#13;
companies from abroad. Total company receipts are therefore equal to 1540.&#13;
Company payments to government amount to a total of 959. The&#13;
composition of this item is set out in Table 6.1 in the next section.&#13;
1/ Inclusive of depreciation.&#13;
2/ See Malaysia, Department of Statistics (1975b), National Accounts, Table&#13;
18, items 26 and 27.&#13;
3/ See National Accounts, Table 15, item 18.&#13;
4/ See National Accounts, Table 18, item 17.&#13;
5/ See the discussion in Section 3.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -&#13;
Additionally, current transfers abroad from the private sectorl/ are assumed&#13;
to be wholly paid by corporate enterprises. These amount to 220.&#13;
The major problem associated with the current accounts of the&#13;
corporate sector is to estimate distributed profits to households, i.e. the&#13;
element T3.4 of Table 2.2. Although a figure of 98 has been used in the&#13;
discussion of household income and outlay accounts, it is only at this point&#13;
that the figure is derived. It is a key figure, for it basically determines&#13;
the division of total private sector savings between households and&#13;
companies. A figure for distributed profits higher than 98 would imply an&#13;
increase of both household income and household savings, and company savings&#13;
would be that much less. Hence private savings as a whole would be&#13;
unaffected, but its division between household and corporate savings would be&#13;
directly changed.&#13;
The Financial Survey of Limited Companies for 1970 gives total&#13;
dividends paid as $398 million. Some proportion of this must be remitted&#13;
abroad but the Financial Survey contains no information on the question of how&#13;
much. We have therefore proceeded as follows. To obtain an estimate of total&#13;
dividends paid by companies, the Financial Survey figure of 398 was scaled up&#13;
by a factor of 1718 divided by 1647. This is the ratio of our estimate of&#13;
total operating surpluses to that of the Financial Survey, and therefore mELkes&#13;
some allowance for the problem of non-coverage in the Survey. Dividends paid&#13;
are therefore estimated as 415.   Next, from Table 18 of the National Accounts,&#13;
1/ See National Accounts, Table 18, item 30.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
net property income payable abroad is given as 317Y1/ If it is assumed that&#13;
none of this item is attributable to compensation of employees, then the&#13;
difference between 415 and 317 gives dividends paid locally, which amount to&#13;
98. The way in which this figure is assumed to be distributed locally has&#13;
been described in Section 3.4. One consequence of the aggregate figure is&#13;
that since total private savings are 1167,i/ the effect of estimating T3.4&#13;
to be 98 is that household savings become 904 and company savings equal 263.&#13;
It is a matter for regret that we have felt unable to achieve some&#13;
disaggregation of the corporate sector accounts since there are a number of&#13;
issues with corresponding government policies which it might be useful to&#13;
examine in the context of the overall SAM. These refer not least to the role&#13;
of numerous parastatal corporations in pushing forward development, and the&#13;
restructuring of the wealth distribution which is integral to Government's&#13;
development strategy. However, after a good deal of investigation into&#13;
several of the possibilities it was concluded that the data were simply&#13;
inadequate to sustain a sound disaggregation.&#13;
6.3 Government Current Account&#13;
As shown in the symbolic SAM in Table 2.3, government receives&#13;
revenues or receipts from households (T5.3), companies (T5.4), the rest of the&#13;
world current accounts (T5.7) and Indirect Taxes (T5.11).&#13;
1/ See National Accounts, Table 18: Items 26 and 27 equal 536,&#13;
Items 13 and 14 equal 219.&#13;
2/ See Section 6.4.&#13;
&#13;

In estimating the Peninsular Malaysia SAM these matrices have been&#13;
estimated from the National Accounts ./ Table 6.1 summarises the information&#13;
on revenues and expenditures of the government obtained from Table 15 of the&#13;
published 1970 National Accounts. For both receipts and expenditures, each&#13;
item has been identified in Table 6.1 according to its number in National&#13;
Accounts Table 15 and classified according to the SAM account from which it is&#13;
received or to which it is paid.&#13;
Taking receipts first, total direct taxes paid by households, plus&#13;
social security payments, were obtained as follows. Direct taxes (item 6 in&#13;
Table 15) were split between payments by households (including unincorporated&#13;
business) and payments by companies on the basis of the proportions recorded&#13;
in the statistics of the Inland Revenue Department../ Social Security&#13;
contributions (item 10) included both contributions of employees and employers&#13;
to the Employees Provident Fund according to the EFCGT Report..2 Compulsory&#13;
fees, fines and penalties (item 9) were assumed to be payable by households.&#13;
These three items provide a total of 352 in government receipts. This accords&#13;
with the totals shown in Table 3.5, where transfers to government from house-&#13;
holds amounted to 135.7, and social security payments were shown to be 216.2.&#13;
Payments from companies were identified as follows. Part of item 6&#13;
(direct taxes) was assumed to come from companies as explained above.&#13;
1/  The National Accounts definition of the government sector differs from the&#13;
definition used by the Treasury. The difference relates to the treatment&#13;
of the "Statutory Bodies" which are technically included in the companies&#13;
accounts under the National Accounts definition.&#13;

Furthermore, it was assumed that item 14 (current transfers to government from&#13;
other resident sectors), item 3 ( property income) and item 1 (operating&#13;
surplus, which is presumably the operating surplus of public companies), were&#13;
all payments from companies to government. Item 31 as recorded in Table 15 of&#13;
the published National Accounts is 'allowances for dapreciation' which iis&#13;
netted out of the government current accounts in the National Accounts&#13;
presentation. This is a capital transaction. It is included here in the&#13;
current accounts as revenue from companies so that government savings are&#13;
increased by a corresponding amount.11 Since the companies account and the&#13;
government account are aggregated, matrix T5.4 is a scalar equaling 9539.&#13;
The other main items in government receipts are non factor incomes&#13;
from the Rest of the World (item 15) and total indirect taxes net of subsidies&#13;
(items 5 and 20). Note that the total net indirect taxes are 1549, consisting&#13;
of payments from activities to indirect taxes (367), a payment from&#13;
commodities to indirect taxes (1184), and against these receipts by government&#13;
are payments of subsidies to commodities (2).&#13;
The expenditure side of the government accounts is equally&#13;
straightforward. Table 6.1 identifies the various components of government&#13;
expenditure according to their item number in Table 15 of the published&#13;
National Accounts.&#13;
Item 21 (social security benefits) are clearly transfers from the&#13;
government to households and item 23 is an aggregate transfer to non-profit&#13;
making bodies which in our context is synonymous with households. The total&#13;
volume of these transfers is taken from Table 15. This total of 171 is part&#13;
1/ See the treatment of government expenditures below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 183 -&#13;
of total current transfers received by households of 670.9 which is the sum&#13;
of T3.3 , T3.4 and T3.5 . Item 18 (property income payable) is assumed to&#13;
be a transfer to companies.&#13;
The major component of expenditure is government consumption, which&#13;
is identified in Table 15 of the National Accounts as item 17. The total&#13;
amount of government consumption (1742) consists of expenditures on various&#13;
commodities and the vector of commodity expenditures is directly available&#13;
from the Input-Output Tables. This gives matrix T9.5 as discussed in the&#13;
previous chapter.&#13;
The residual difference between total receipts and the various&#13;
expenditures identified above is equal to savings (item 30) and depreciation&#13;
(item 31). These two together give gross saving of the government account&#13;
which is shown as a payment from government to the consolidated capital&#13;
account.&#13;
6.4 Consolidated Capital Accounts&#13;
Details of the consolidated capital account are largely determined at&#13;
this stage as a result of entries in other parts of the accounting system&#13;
which, in turn, are consistent with published National Accounts details. The&#13;
available information is brought together in Table 6.2 for both incomings and&#13;
outgoings, together with their sources in the published National Accounts.&#13;
Total savings from the three domestic institutional categories&#13;
(including consumption of fixed capital (depreciation)) amount to 1986. Only&#13;
the government share of this is directly identifiable in the accounts: the&#13;
share of private savings for the household and company accounts largely&#13;
depends upon the estimate of distributed profits from companies to households,&#13;

- 185 -&#13;
as discussed previously. Given these aggregates, more detail on the&#13;
contribution to domestic savings of each of our 32 separate household types&#13;
has already been discussed in Chapter 3.&#13;
On the expenditure side of the accounts, the resources arising from&#13;
domestic and foreign savings are used to finance gross fixed capital formation&#13;
of 1701 and increases in stocks of 315.1' Complete balance on the capital&#13;
accounts is achieved by including capital inflows from the Rest of the&#13;
World. The deficit on the current Balance of Payments is 30 21/ This&#13;
represents the net external receipts of capital funds. However, net capital&#13;
transfers by government to the Rest of the World is 85, so the net lending by&#13;
the Rest of the World to Peninsular Malaysia is determined as 115.&#13;
The fact that in our schema the capital accounts for each domestic&#13;
institution have been consolidated into a single account implies that there&#13;
are no details of flow of funds between institutions in the SAM. This is yet&#13;
another area in which future progress might usefully be attempted since, in&#13;
principle, the SAM framework is ideal for presentation of such detailsi/&#13;
Moreover, the issues are important since ultimately the build up and&#13;
deployment of real capital resources is basic to the long-run determination of&#13;
income distribution and the development of the economy. However, at present,&#13;
the data needed for a disaggregation of the capital account and treatment of&#13;
1/   See Table 4.5, and National Accounts, Table 3, items 6 and 7.&#13;
2/   See National Accounts, Table 18, item 32.&#13;
3/   Pyatt and Thorbecke (1976) discuss the extension of a SAM in this&#13;
direction. Subsequent studies, and in particular one for Botswana, have&#13;
incorporated flow of funds within a SAM framework (see Hayden and Round&#13;
(1982)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 186 -&#13;
flow of funds is not available.  For the present, therefore, the balancing of&#13;
savings and investment as in Table 6.2 has to suffice.&#13;
6.5 Rest of the World Accounts&#13;
The final set of accounts for Peninsular Malaysia that remain for&#13;
discussion are those relating to transactions with the Rest of the World.&#13;
Table 6.3 draws together the available information from the National Accounts&#13;
statistics for External transactions on current account. However, the&#13;
National Accounts±/ gives some details on capital transactions and&#13;
transfers. It should be noted that in the SAM presentation of the External&#13;
transactions, the accounts are represented from the Rest of the World poinlt of&#13;
view. This convention is maintained in Table 6.3. It means that a current&#13;
account deficit for Peninsular Malaysia is synonymous with foreign savingis.&#13;
Details of the commodity transactions with the Rest of the World have&#13;
already been discussed in Chapter 5 and set out in Table 5.5 (exports&#13;
(f.o.b.)) and Table 5.6 (imports (c.i.f.)). These figures involve some small&#13;
adjustments from the data published in the Input-Output tables since this&#13;
source does not include certain items in the external transactions account of&#13;
the National Accounts. Some further details of the latter are set out in&#13;
Table 6.4.&#13;
Since the commodity balances shown in the Input-Output tables amount&#13;
to 4164.5 for exports and 3667.4 for imports, the difference between these&#13;
figures and those in the National Accounts are identifiable from Table 6.4 as&#13;
167.5 for exports and 183.6 for imports. These items are standard entries&#13;

which, according to the SNA, are part of non-commodity imports and exports due&#13;
to outlays by tourists, diplomatic and military personnel. Their difference&#13;
(16.0) has been added to the estimate of Consumers Expenditure in the National&#13;
Accounts! and has been treated correspondingly by us in Chapter 3. Our&#13;
approach has therefore been to adjust the commodity balances, showing a&#13;
pattern of exports which includes the 167.5 discrepancy and to match this with&#13;
imports of like amounts, together with a further import of 16.0 routed through&#13;
wants for eventual household consumption.&#13;
Table 6.5 shows the commodity breakdown of these items which have&#13;
been simultaneously added to imports (and hence gross commodity supplies) and&#13;
to exports (and hence gross commodity demands). This breakdown was arrived at&#13;
by assuming that about 60 percent of tourist expenditure would be in hotels&#13;
and restaurants (amounting to 100.0); the remainder was then allocated to the&#13;
most likely commodities in a fairly arbitrary way. As discussed previously,&#13;
the additional import of 16.0 has been shown as an import of 'Hotel and&#13;
Restaurant Services' (commodity 43) and routed through the Wants matrix (T9.1)&#13;
as an eventual purchase by households as extra 'Expenditure in Restaurants and&#13;
Hotels', (Want 33).&#13;
On the capital side of the accounts, the net capital transfer of 85&#13;
from Peninsular Malaysia to the Rest of the World has previously been noted.&#13;
Taken together with the current account deficit of 30, this transfer implies a&#13;
total net lending to Peninsular Malaysia (net investment from abroad) of 115&#13;

There is no disaggregation of the external accounts for Peninsular&#13;
Malaysia in our treatment this far. However, to produce accounts for All&#13;
Malaysia requires a distinction between Peninsular Malaysia transactions with&#13;
East Malaysia and transactions with other parts of the rest of the world.&#13;
This disaggregation is discussed in Chapter 8. Before coming to it, Chapter 7&#13;
presents SAM estimates for East Malaysia in 1970. This posed a very different&#13;
set of accounting and estimation problems relative to those for West Malaysia&#13;
in view of the rudimentary nature of East Malaysia's statistical sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER 7&#13;
A SAM FOR EAST MALAYSIA&#13;
7.1 Introduction&#13;
East Malaysia comprises the states of Sabah and Sarawak. They are&#13;
separated from West or Peninsular Malaysia by some 500 miles of sea, and it is&#13;
relatively recently that the two states have joined the Federation. These&#13;
facts, and especially the latter, explain why statistics for East Malaysia in&#13;
1970 are relatively rudimentary. In fact great strides have been made in the&#13;
past few years towards statistical coverage on a par with that for the West.&#13;
Integrated National Accounts are now being generated. But for 1970, which is&#13;
the base year for the Second Malaysian Plan, the integration has not been&#13;
attempted in published sources and basic data for East Malaysia are relatively&#13;
sparse.&#13;
In the next chapter we attempt to produce a social accounting matrix&#13;
for 1970 for the whole of Malaysia. This inevitably involves an attempt to&#13;
build a SAM picture for the Eastern States and provides the subject matter for&#13;
the present chapter. It involves working with data which are limited both in&#13;
coverage and consistency. Accordingly it presents a rather different set of&#13;
issues to those faced in constructing a SAM for Peninsular Malaysia as&#13;
discussed in previous chapters. And, in fact, the problems would have been&#13;
insuperable were we not prepared to 'borrow' details from our results for West&#13;
Malaysia to fill in lacunae in the source material for the East.&#13;
From one point of view, the need to borrow data from West Malaysia in&#13;
filling out detailed accounts for the East suggests an interesting perspective&#13;
for the present exercise. Specifically, since few countries are comparable to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 193 -&#13;
Malaysia in the quality and coverage of data, any attempt to build a SAM for&#13;
these countries must potentially have recourse to 'guesstimation' in some&#13;
form. One possibility is to borrow details from another, similar economy.&#13;
This is the approach that is illustrated in the present chapter.&#13;
Our objective in this effort was relatively limited. We were&#13;
concerned to produce an aggregate SAM for East Malaysia comparable to that for&#13;
the Peninsular set out in Table 2.1. Beyond this, the analysis for the&#13;
Peninsular has involved detailed disaggregation of accounts for Wants,&#13;
Factors, Households, Commodities and Production Activities. For the Eastern&#13;
States we have been less ambitious. For the most part our efforts have&#13;
concentrated on the Commodity and Production accounts. These are&#13;
disaggregated in the same detail as the accounts for Peninsular Malaysia and&#13;
the methods used are set out in Section 7.2 below. Then, in Section 7.3, the&#13;
remaining details for an aggregate SAM are discussed. Finally, Section 7.4&#13;
comments on the results obtained and the prospects for further&#13;
disaggregation. A partial disaggregation of the factor accounts is discussed,&#13;
together with comment on the methods that might be used to obtain further&#13;
details. However, subject to the exception of the partial disaggregation of&#13;
factor accounts just referred to, our results for East Malaysia are restricted&#13;
to an aggregate SAM and detailed accounts for commodities and activities.&#13;
The available data for East Malaysia comprises what might be&#13;
considered the basic essentials for macroeconomic policy. First, there are&#13;
some simple national accounts set out as Tables 7.1 and 7.2. They show GDP by&#13;
expenditure category under the main headings, and an eleven-sector breakdown&#13;
of GDP by industry of origin. These data were provided to us by the&#13;
Department of Statistics, Kuala Lumpur. Despite their provisional nature, we&#13;

have accepted them without modification and therefore havested all other&#13;
estimates to be consistent with them. Reference to alternative sources!'&#13;
suggests that it would be difficult to improve on the provisional estimates in&#13;
Tables 7.1 and 7.2 for 1970.&#13;
The second main source of information is again provisional and gives&#13;
details of gross outputs and net outputs for various production activities.&#13;
As we shall see in the next section, combining this detail with that in Table&#13;
7.2 yields gross and net output figures for each of our 30 production&#13;
activities.&#13;
Thirdly, detailed trade statistics are available for East Malaysia 2/&#13;
together with other elements of the Balance of Payments.S Hence direct&#13;
estimates of external transactions, including a breakdown of imports and&#13;
exports into our 59 commodity groups, are available.&#13;
These, then, are our main sources. Additionally there is some&#13;
information on corporate activity in the 1971 Financial Survey; and some&#13;
details of Government income and outlays is also available. In the present&#13;
instance this is not as good as it would be if we were considering a national&#13;
economy, since the regional disaggregation of what are essentially Federal&#13;
expenditures, e.g. Defense, is not an entirely meaningful exercise. However,&#13;
this must be accepted as one of the costs in our chosen strategy of building&#13;

separate SAMs for Peninsular and East Malaysia, leaving the combination of the&#13;
two as a subsequent step.&#13;
Table 7.3 sets out the aggregate SAM for East Malaysia which, as&#13;
noted above, is consistent with the details in Tables 7.1 and 7.2. However,&#13;
at this point in the argument, the structure of Table 7.3 is of more interest&#13;
than the detailed entries. And in these terms it can be noted that the data&#13;
sources we have are restricted for the most part to accounts 7 to 11, i.e. to&#13;
external transactions (accounts 7 and 8), production (accounts 9 and 10), and&#13;
indirect taxes (account 11): we have little basic information on consumption&#13;
(wants), factors, or the income and outlay accounts of institutions (with the&#13;
partial exception of Government). Thus some attempt can be made to provide&#13;
estimates for East Malaysia covering accounts 7 to 11 but the potential for&#13;
disaggregation within accounts 1 to 6 is at best limited. Our main effort is&#13;
therefore restricted to the details of accounts 7 to 11.&#13;
This limited ambition in constructing an East Malaysia SAM implies&#13;
that our analysis foreshadows the evolutionary step from traditional methods&#13;
of compiling national accounts to methods which are based on a commodity&#13;
balance approach. Accordingly our estimates are not subject to the&#13;
consistency check provided in the SAM framework by detailed Factor and&#13;
Household accounts: the consistency checks for accounts 1 to 6 are limited to&#13;
those in the aggregate SAM and are essentially entailed in acceptance of&#13;
details from Tables 7.1 and 7.2 as datum. Rather, with respect to East&#13;
1alaysia, we are at the prior stage of trying to secure consistency in&#13;
detailed commodity balances in the absence of direct estimates of the&#13;
technology and make matrices (T9g10 and T10.9) for East Malaysia. The issue&#13;
is therefore whether we can usefully borrow such details from West Malaysia,&#13;

combine these with the primary data for East Malaysia which is available, and&#13;
hence come up with useful estimates for accounts 7 to 11 which are comparable&#13;
to the corresponding details for West Malaysia.!'&#13;
7.2 Production and Commodity Accounts&#13;
Given the general focus of our analysis on accounts 7 to 11 of SAM,&#13;
much of the discussion can be centered around a simplified SAM in which&#13;
accounts of secondary interest are consolidated. Table 7.4 sets out a format&#13;
for this purpose. In it accounts 9, 10 and 11, i.e. Commodities, Activities&#13;
and Indirect taxes are shown in full detail. The current and capital accounts&#13;
for the Rest of the World are consolidated into a single account, while&#13;
further consolidation brings together accounts 1 to 6 in a single account 'All&#13;
Other'.  This format allows full details to be retained on the SAM sub-&#13;
matrices  T79 , T97 , T9.10 , T10.9 , T119.      and  T11.10'  Accordingly their&#13;
derivation can be discussed in full within the framework.&#13;
In the procedures we have adopted the first step has been to estimate&#13;
value added, gross outputs and indirect taxes on activities for each of the 30&#13;
production activities. The results are shown in Table 7.5 (see p.306). They&#13;
are based on some unpublished results for a 1970 census which are not entirely&#13;
consistent with the data at the 11-sector level shown in Table 7.2.&#13;
Accordingly we have made proportional adjustments to value added in the census&#13;
data within each of the broader 11-sector aggregates. Beyond this, the census&#13;
data on indirect taxes paid by each activity have been adopted directly, while&#13;
1/ To a degree these exercises anticipate work envisaged by the Department of&#13;
Statistics, Kuala Lumpur. However, their methodology is likely to differ&#13;
from ours and will potentially involve more primary data. On both counts&#13;
our estimates should therefore be regarded as provisional. In due course&#13;
a comparison of results could prove most interesting.&#13;

the ratio observed in the census for intermediate purchases versus value added&#13;
has been retained. In this way an estimate of gross outputs in each activity&#13;
(t1o) has been built up, together with details for the outlay account of&#13;
activities as defined in Table 7.4. These details include total intermediate&#13;
purchases by each activity, i.e. the column totals of matrix T9.10 I but they&#13;
do not provide an estimate of the matrix itself.&#13;
Gross outputs on the cost side must be equal to the total revenue of&#13;
activities, i.e. to the row totals of the make matrix T10.9 , which are&#13;
denoted T10.9i = t10 . To estimate the full matrix for East Malaysia we have&#13;
made use of the corresponding details for West Malaysia. Specifically, a&#13;
matrix B10.9 has been obtained for West Malaysia by the normalization&#13;
(7.1)    B10.9  =   t1O-1 T10.9&#13;
Rows of this matrix are proportions, showing the commodity mix of output for&#13;
each activity. This matrix is now assumed to be the same for both East and&#13;
West Malaysia. Accordingly an estimate of T10.9 for East Malaysia can be&#13;
obtained as&#13;
(7.2)    T10.9      t10 B10.9&#13;
i.e. by spreading East Malaysian gross outputs of activities across&#13;
commodities in the same proportions as were previously observed for West&#13;
Malaysia. The results of this estimation procedure are shown in Table 7.6&#13;
(see p.307).&#13;
Table 7.6 also gives estimates of imports (T7.9) and indirect taxes&#13;
on commodities (T11 9). The former are taken directly fromethe East Malaysian&#13;
trade statistics after reconciliation of some minor discrepancies to&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

correspond with the total for imports given in Table 7.1. Similarly, indirect&#13;
taxes on commodities are estimated using West Malaysian proportions but&#13;
subject to the overall constraint on net indirect taxes of 253.0 in Table&#13;
7.1. Since indirect taxes on activities have been previously estimated as&#13;
123.8 (see Table 7.5), it follows that indirect taxes on commodities are&#13;
constrained to 129.2 (= 253.0 - 123.8) at this stage.&#13;
Since imports, domestic supplies of commodities and indirect tax(ss on&#13;
commodities are now all determined, the outlay accounts for commodities are&#13;
complete. Thus total commodity supplies, tg , are determined and our&#13;
estimates of them are included in Table 7.6.&#13;
Table 7.7 (see p.308) sets out the results of the final stage of the&#13;
estimation of an East Malaysia SAM in the format of Table 7.4. The table&#13;
shows total demands for commodities, and these results are taken over from the&#13;
estimates of total supplies in Table 7.6. It also shows a commodity brealkdown&#13;
of exports (T9g7) which is obtained directly from the external trade&#13;
statistics. To obtain the further details for private and public consumption,&#13;
capital formation and the technology matrix T910 we have had recourse once&#13;
more to the corresponding details for West Malaysia.&#13;
Table 7.8 sets out the format of the missing details for East&#13;
Malaysia at this stage in the estimation process. These are, first, the&#13;
vectors of commodity expenditures for private consumption, public consumption,&#13;
and investment, i.e. the domestic components of final demand; and, secondly,&#13;
the technology matrix T9.10 . Collectively, the unknowns are therefore the&#13;
components of the domestic demand for commodities.&#13;
While all elements of Table 7.8 are unknown for East Malaysia, full&#13;
information on these details has been derived for West Malaysia in earlier&#13;

chapters. Moreover, for East Malaysia, all row and column totals of Table 7.8&#13;
have been derived previously. Thus the row totals are given by the gross&#13;
output estimates in Table 7.6 minus the direct estimates of exports in Table&#13;
7.7. The column totals for consumption and investment are known from Table&#13;
7.1. And a total for intermediate purchases by each production activity is&#13;
available from Table 7.5. It follows that the RAS procedure can be used to&#13;
obtain estimates of the details of Table 7.8 for East Malaysia from the&#13;
previously derived detail for West Malaysia-Y and the available row and coliumn&#13;
totals for East Malaysia. In this way the information needed to complete&#13;
Table 7.7 has been obtained.&#13;
Estimation of the details in Table 7.7 completes the calibration oE a&#13;
SAM for East Malaysia according to the format of Table 7.4. In the final&#13;
section of this chapter some general comment is made on the methods used.&#13;
However, to end this section, we include more specific commentary on the&#13;
results and procedures for obtaining activity and commodity balances.&#13;
The narrative in this chapter has attempted to express the limited&#13;
range of data available for East Malaysia in 1970, while the methods adopted&#13;
have been designed to make full use of the data which exists. Beyond this,&#13;
our recourse to West Malaysia data has been inevitable. But the particular&#13;
procedures adopted have not been inevitable since there is clearly more than&#13;
one way in which the known facts for East Malaysia could have been filled out&#13;
via reference to West Malaysia statistics. The question, therefore, is&#13;
whether the most sensible procedures have been used, and opinions may&#13;
obviously differ on the answer to it.&#13;
1/ See Table 5.4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 205 -&#13;
In defense of the methods used, a crucial issue is the estimation of&#13;
aggregate commodity demands and supplies. The approach has been to build&#13;
these up from primary source estimates of gross outputs via the matrix&#13;
B10.9 defined in equation (7.1). The assumption is that the mix of&#13;
commodities supplied by each activity is the same in East and West Malaysia.&#13;
While this must clearly be a poor assumption in some cases, it seems to be far&#13;
preferable in general to assuming that the mix of imports and acivities&#13;
supplying each commodity is the same in both East and West Malaysia.&#13;
Having obtained estimates of total commodity supplies which are&#13;
consistent with aggregate demands for consumption goods, investment goods and&#13;
raw material requirements, the use of RAS methods to complete details of Table&#13;
7.8 is an obvious step. Indeed, RAS was devis d initially for the purpose of&#13;
updating input-output matricesL/ for a given country. Our use of it here to&#13;
adjust a table for one region to obtain details for another is a natural&#13;
variant, and the literature on the applicability of RAS essentially remains&#13;
relevant to it 2/&#13;
A feature of the RAS procedure is that it is an iterative sequence of&#13;
calculations which alternates between row and column balances. As applied in&#13;
this instance, column balances are addressed first. Thus the first step has&#13;
been to rescale columns of Table 7.8 as given by West Malaysia data so as to&#13;
obtain figures which are consistent with the East Malaysia column control&#13;
totals. This then provides new estimates which in aggregate will satisfy the&#13;
row constraints but in detail are at variance with them. Subsequent steps of&#13;
1/ See Cambridge, Department of Applied Economics (1962-), especially Vol. 3.&#13;
2/ See, for example, Paelinck and Waelbroeck (1963).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 206 -&#13;
RAS are directed towards the iterative elimination of this variance.&#13;
Meanwhile results from the first step indicate how close an approximation can&#13;
be obtained simply by assuming that column proportions are the same in East&#13;
Malaysia as in the West.&#13;
In practice the absolute errors observed at the end of this first&#13;
step were of the order of 20 percent on average, but in two instances (which&#13;
pull up this average) they were substantially higher. These are wood products&#13;
(commodity 19) and the products of coal and petroleum (commodity 25). Since&#13;
these are the major export items for East Malaysia, there is an obvious&#13;
inference that the trade statistics might be out of line. However commodity&#13;
trade is one of the few areas in which independent and ostensibly firm data&#13;
for East Malaysia is available. We have therefore made no adjustment to it.&#13;
It seems, however, that in line with previous RAS experience,-L/ direct&#13;
estimation of details for the principal items, with RAS applied residually to&#13;
other details, would be one relatively straightforward way of improving on the&#13;
estimates.&#13;
7.3 Other Accounts for East Malaysia&#13;
Results obtained in the previous section provide full details for&#13;
accounts 9 to 11 and a commodity breakdown of imports and exports. The&#13;
importance of forestry products and petroleum in the latter has been noted.&#13;
With respect to imports attention can be drawn to the importance of&#13;
manufactured goods, especially electrical goods and machinery.&#13;
Table 7.9 provides the detail needed to complete accounts 7 and 8 of&#13;
the aggregate SAM shown as Table 7.3. The figures are taken directly from the&#13;

provisional figures provided to us by the Departmentof Statistics, Kuala&#13;
Lumpur and show a current account deficit of 8.8. This appears as a transfer&#13;
from the Rest of the World current account to capital account in Table 7.3.&#13;
Outstanding details of the aggregate SAM shown as Table 7.3 have been&#13;
obtained as follows. Factor incomes, excluding payments abroad, have been&#13;
split between households and companies by reference to the 1971 Financial&#13;
Survey. This shows that corporate activity takes place in only 8 of the 30&#13;
activities and is relatively insignificant in four of these.!' For the more&#13;
significant sectors the share of corporate profit in value added is similar to&#13;
that observed for West Malaysia. This then suggests that the aggregate&#13;
Financial Survey figure for corporate profit in East Malaysia can be accepted&#13;
as a reasonable estimate. This implies that household income from factors is&#13;
1376.0.&#13;
Government income comprises receipts from households and companies in&#13;
the form of direct taxes, transfers from the rest of the world, and indirect&#13;
taxes. Estimates of direct tax revenues were obtained from the 1970 Inland&#13;
Revenue Report. Other receipts have already been discussed. Government&#13;
expenditures consist of transfers to households, companies and the rest of the&#13;
world; savings; and expenditures on goods and services. Government transfers&#13;
to the rest of the world and expenditures on commodities have already been&#13;
estimated. Government transfers to households and companies were estimated,&#13;
using West Malaysian data, as a percentage of total income received by&#13;
households and companies rather than as a percentage of total government&#13;

expenditure. By taking the former approach, transfer payments have been&#13;
linked to income levels of the recipients rather than the income level of the&#13;
government itself. Estimates were made using both approaches. In the case of&#13;
households, the two estimates were approximately the same. However, in the&#13;
case of companies, estimates of transfers on the basis of company incomes were&#13;
significantly lower.   In light of the fact that transfers to companies from&#13;
government represent property income, the lower estimate appeared to be more&#13;
realistic.&#13;
Household income transfers to other households (i.e. inter-household&#13;
transfers) were also estimated for consistency with the Peninsular Malaysia&#13;
SAM, even though for East Malaysia no disaggregation of the household accounts&#13;
have been attempted. As with government transfers, these were estimated by&#13;
applying West Malaysian proportions, where 5.0 percent of gross household&#13;
expenditures are distributed in this way. The resulting amount of 74.2 is&#13;
therefore included in both total income and outlay of households. Admittedly,&#13;
this is a crude estimate of the total transfers between households which&#13;
affects only the household account since it lies on the diagonal in the SAM.&#13;
Nevertheless, without it, the income and outlay accounts for East and West&#13;
Malaysia would not be comparable. An additional 10.9 of household income was&#13;
estimated to be derived from companies as distributed profits. This was&#13;
obtained by assuming that companies in East Malaysia distribute the same&#13;
percentage of their gross income as those in West Malaysia (6.8 percent).&#13;
Household income therefore totals 1486.1.&#13;
One result of these calculations is that total savings amount to&#13;
434.0. Of this total 93.8 are shown to be capital transfers received from&#13;
abroad, leaving 340.2 as the amount of domestic savings. Within this figure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 210 -&#13;
the estimate of household savings equals 196.8. This represents a savings&#13;
rate of approximately 13 percent, which is roughly equivalent to the savinsgs&#13;
rate estimated for West Malaysia. The estimates for corporate and governmient&#13;
savings are 106.6 and 36.8, respectively.&#13;
7.4 Some Comments on the East Malaysia SAM&#13;
The results obtained in this chapter are clearly dependent on&#13;
assuming some similarities between East and West Malaysia. The 'borrowing' of&#13;
coefficients which has been a basis for the estimation when direct information&#13;
is lacking is an admittedly crude procedure so that the derived estimates laust&#13;
be considered as initial approximations only. However, this is not to say&#13;
that the estimates are worthless. On the contrary, they bring together what&#13;
is known about East Malaysia in terms of macroeconomic data and fill out these&#13;
facts in a way which is arguably sensible. To the extent that this is&#13;
successful, a more detailed picture of East Malaysia begins to emerge. And&#13;
where difficulties or discrepancies arise, an obvious focus for future&#13;
statistical priorities is clearly identified. While one might look ultimately&#13;
for data on East Malaysia which is as rich as that for the West, the view lie&#13;
have formed as a result of our investigations is that the availability of new&#13;
primary data on relatively few activities and commodities could enhance the&#13;
overall quality of the results considerably.&#13;
It can also be pointed out that the 'borrowing' of data as&#13;
illustrated here is not such a cavalier step as some purists might maintain.&#13;
In this context, the fact that economic modellers are 'borrowing' data all the&#13;
time is hardly a strong defense.   But it is'more to the point to cite common&#13;
practice in national accounts compilations Few countries collect annual&#13;
information on inter-industry transactions. Intervals of three or four years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 211 -&#13;
are more common, to which periods of one or two years must be added to allow&#13;
for the time taken in data processing. Hence national accounts compilation&#13;
may rely on an input-output table which is up to five years out of date. In&#13;
an economy growing at seven percent per annum the rules of compound interest&#13;
imply that there has been growth of 50 percent between the base year of the&#13;
input-output table and its application to obtain consistency of commodity&#13;
balances for national accounts purposes. In comparison, our borrowings of&#13;
data may involve margins of error which are comparable as opposed to being of&#13;
a different order of magnitude.&#13;
While the borrowing of data can be defended to a degree in the above&#13;
terms, there remains the choice of methods for reconciling such extraneous&#13;
estimates with the known facts for East Malaysia. Our procedures are&#13;
admittedly arrived at through judgement and trial and error. Others would&#13;
prefer more formal procedures.   These are becoming availablel/ and an&#13;
interesting comparison might be made between the methods we have used and a&#13;
more objective approach. Equally, there are alternative subjective methods&#13;
and more than one formal approach has been suggested. Experience with&#13;
alternatives could provide a useful subject for future research. Meanwhile,&#13;
each approach recognizes the need to reconcile data from sources which have&#13;
different degrees of reliability. The problem is therefore to make the best&#13;
use of available data as a complementary step toward having better primary&#13;
data.&#13;
While the present exercise has stopped at the point of having&#13;
disaggregated production accounts for commodities and activities, it would in&#13;
1/ See Byron (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 212 -&#13;
principal be possible to go further. A minor step is achieved in Table 7.10&#13;
(see p.309) which shows value added for each production activity split as&#13;
between four types of factor payment. These data are estimated using the 1971&#13;
Financial Survey figures for corporate profits, and otherwise taking column&#13;
proportions from observed ratios for West Malaysia. The figures do not,&#13;
therefore, add much of a specifically East Malaysian character to the SAi.&#13;
Nor do they open up possibilities for further disaggregation in other pairts of&#13;
the matrix since the factoral distribution of income which emerges has aLready&#13;
been utilized in full to obtain the aggregate SAM information for accounl:s 1&#13;
to 6.&#13;
To go further in obtaining disaggregation within the SAM it is&#13;
essential to have results from a household survey. This point is obvious and&#13;
has previously been made explicit in work on other countries X It is not&#13;
just a commentary point, however. For us the point is rather that a&#13;
disaggregation of household and factor accounts should be the point of&#13;
emphasis in developing national accounts, and to do this in a SAM framework is&#13;
both convenient and efficient. In general terms we know that Sabah appears to&#13;
have a high per capita GDP compared with other Malaysian states. Sarawak. is&#13;
relatively less affluent but its industrial base has been changing rapidly,&#13;
not least through growth in oil extraction. These facts underlie the dynamics&#13;
of migration and relative incomes which are known to be taking place. But&#13;
they are not captured by the disaggregations within our SAM for East&#13;
Malaysia. A regional breakdown of labor and household accounts may be the&#13;
best way to do so. Or, as we found in West Malaysia, it may be that some&#13;
1/ See Pyatt and Round (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 213 -&#13;
factor such as education is the crucial consideration. Speculation on such&#13;
questions can only be a preliminary phase. The issue in East Malaysia, as&#13;
elsewhere, is to develop statistics towards an evaluation of: who gets what;&#13;
and how much do they get? It is in these respects that we consider our&#13;
achievements in compiling an East Malaysia SAM limited, and merely a&#13;
beginning.&#13;

CHAPTER 8&#13;
A SAM FOR ALL MALAYSIA&#13;
8.1 Regional and National Accounts&#13;
The previous chapters have shown how SAMs can be constructed from&#13;
available data sources for both East and West Malaysia. The sources for West&#13;
Malaysia are substantially better than those for East Malaysia, both in terms&#13;
of coverage and quality of data. This difference is largely explained in&#13;
historical terms. Only since 1963 have the Eastern States of Sabah and&#13;
Sarawak joined the Federation, and their statistical services, although&#13;
continually undergoing improvements, are still less advanced than those for&#13;
the Peninsular States.&#13;
The perspective in previous chapters has been to consider East&#13;
Malaysia and West Malaysia as distinct economies. However, an obvious change&#13;
in perspective sees them as distinct regions of the same economy, i.e. as All&#13;
Malaysia or, simply, Malaysia. This re-orientation provides the subject&#13;
matter of the present chapter which is therefore concerned with the&#13;
integration of the separate SAMs for the two regions, leading ultimately to a&#13;
SAM for Malaysia as a whole. The issues raised are not trivial and we can&#13;
note at this early stage that generation of an All Malaysia SAM is not simply&#13;
a matter of aggregation.&#13;
A SAM approach to regional accounting schemes gives emphasis to&#13;
structural connections and hence to the linkages between regional&#13;
components. This implies that in order to derive a SAM for All Malaysia, we&#13;
must give detailed consideration to the transactions between the two&#13;
economies. In the first instance, this involves a disaggregation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 215 -&#13;
external transactions for each economy (region) into transactions between East&#13;
and West Malaysia (interregional transactions), and transactions by each&#13;
region with other parts of the world. However, it should be noted that in the&#13;
particular case which concerns us, the situation as it exists between the two&#13;
regions of Malaysia is complicated by the position of Singapore as an entrepot&#13;
for a variety of commercial activities. A good deal of merchandise trade&#13;
between East and West Malaysia is still routed through Singapore, while its&#13;
position as a financial and commercial center means that many non-merchandise&#13;
transactions and monetary transfers are cleared through Singapore financial&#13;
intermediaries. In consequence, there are very real difficulties in&#13;
distinguishing actual East/West flows as opposed to those which involve the&#13;
:Lntermediation of Singapore. For our purposes here we have generally assumed&#13;
that estimates provided by the Department of Statistics in Kuala Lumpur have&#13;
somehow managed to reconcile such difficulties.&#13;
While the identification of actual interregional transctions is a&#13;
major issue, there are in addition some conceptual problems in the design of a&#13;
SAM schema to accommodate a regional dimension. Thus in the next section,&#13;
Section 8.2, we discuss the problems of obtaining consistent data on&#13;
interregional transactions from available sources; while Section 8.3 discusses&#13;
the subsequent conceptual issue of how this data should be presented. Both&#13;
topics are of some general interest. With respect to consistent data it can&#13;
be noted that in order to obtain a SAM for All Malaysia, it is necessary first&#13;
to split the external accounts for each region into that part which represents&#13;
transfers within the All Malaysia context, and that part which represents&#13;
transactions with other parts of the world. In effect, the previous Rest of&#13;
World accounts within each regional SAM have to be disaggregated. And it can&#13;
be noted that the methods for doing so illustrate an option within the SAM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 216 -&#13;
framework which is independent of the ultimate goal of producing an All&#13;
Malaysia SAM. This is simply to achieve a disaggregation of the external&#13;
accounts of an economy to show separately the links with different&#13;
international trading or financing partners. Many countries are already&#13;
developing their Balance of Payments statistics in this direction since there&#13;
are obvious policy implications to be derived from differences in the pattern&#13;
of external transactions with different currency areas, countries in different&#13;
stages of development, or different economic or political blocs. The SAM&#13;
format can accommodate these distinctions with no extra difficulties to those&#13;
which attend an attempt to disaggregate Balance of Payments data on such a&#13;
basis. The disaggregation of external transactions for East or West Malaysia&#13;
illustrates the point.&#13;
While trade between East and West Malaysia is a component of external&#13;
transactions for both regions, it is not an external transaction for All&#13;
Malaysia. Accordingly such interregional trade must be netted out to obtain&#13;
external accounts for All Malaysia. This requires that it should be estimated&#13;
consistently from the point of view of both regions if the data are to be&#13;
reconciled. To do so is not a trivial matter since the problem is more&#13;
complex than the need to arrive at a common set of figures given alternative&#13;
initial estimates. Additionally there is a conceptual problem which derives&#13;
from the treatment of commodity flows from West to East Malaysia as exports at&#13;
f.o.b. prices from the West Malaysian point of view; and as imports at c.i.f.&#13;
prices from the point of view of East Malaysia. The distinction is analogous&#13;
to that between factor and basic prices as discussed in Chapter 5 and the&#13;
treatment of it in Section 8.3 is fundamental to a regional accounting scheme.&#13;
The crux of the matter is to recognize that essentially similar commodities&#13;
may be traded in different markets. In this case the markets differ according&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 217 -&#13;
to location, and delivery charges have to be accounted for. Obviously, our&#13;
starting point was the separate SAMs for East and West Malaysia. However, the&#13;
problem is a general one which is inherent in any attempt to derive a SAM by&#13;
combining SAMs for different economies.&#13;
While consistency in the treatment of interregional commodity flows&#13;
is sufficient to obtain an All Malaysia SAM with detailed commodity accounts,&#13;
there is an obvious interest in an All Malaysia SAM which retains a regional&#13;
disaggregation within the accounts. There are several alternative formats&#13;
within which this can be done,l/ corresponding to more or less exacting&#13;
demands for primary data. The one we favor is among the least demanding in&#13;
its data needs. It is presented in Section 8.4 as an intermediate step&#13;
towards a final, aggregate SAM for All Malaysia. To obtain it, we have first&#13;
generated the extended multi-regional SAM shown as Table 8.1.&#13;
In introducing the SAM set out as Table 8.1 it should be noted first&#13;
that the accounts within it can be viewed as comprising three principal blocks&#13;
of accounts. One block relates to East Malaysia; the second to West Malaysia,&#13;
and the third to the Rest of the World. Hitherto, in discussing the accounts&#13;
of either East or West Malaysia alone, the 'Rest of the World' has referred to&#13;
all areas other than the regional economy in question.    But now that&#13;
interregional transactions are being considered explicitly, the term 'Rest of&#13;
the World' is restricted to areas outside of Malaysia, i.e. it is the whole&#13;
World apart from East and West Malaysia.&#13;
1/ These have been previously discussed by Roe A.R and Round J.I.(1975) in&#13;
the context of a regional accounting scheme for the Caribbean Economic&#13;
Community.&#13;

Each of the blocks of accounts for East and West Malaysia contain&#13;
nine separate accounts. These are the nine domestic accounts previously shown&#13;
in the aggregate SAMs for East and West Malaysia, i.e. they exclude the&#13;
external accounts for each region (accounts 7 and 8). In this new format,&#13;
'Rest of World' has the same definition from the point of view of both&#13;
regions. Transactions with it are shown bordering Table 8.1 and are labelled&#13;
as accounts 7* and 8* in recognition that the definition of 'Rest of World' is&#13;
now different.&#13;
A consequence of representing the accounts in the format of Table 8.1&#13;
is that transactions between the domestic accounts for East Malaysia on the&#13;
one hand, and those for West Malaysia on the other, appear as diagonal entries&#13;
in off-diagonal partitions of the table. This emphasizes their interregional&#13;
transfer characteristic. The sources and derivation of these interregional&#13;
transfers will be discussed in the next section. For now the point to note is&#13;
that their location in Table 8.1 implies that interregional transfers are&#13;
simultaneously shown as an outgoing from an account in one region and as an&#13;
incoming to the same account in the other region. Not all accounts have!&#13;
interregional transfers associated with them, however. The Wants accounts&#13;
(number 1) simply define a mapping between household requirements and the&#13;
commodities they ultimately demand; and this mapping is fundamentally without&#13;
a geographical dimension. Commodities may be traded interregionally, but&#13;
Wants are not, so the elements at the intersection of Wants account, East with&#13;
West, are defintionally zero. So too are the interregional transfers&#13;
associated with Activities and Indirect Taxes (accounts 10 and 11). These are&#13;
strictly 'within region' accounts: Activities are engaged only in the&#13;
production of commodities, and as such do not interact with external accounts;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 220 -&#13;
similarly, the Indirect Tax accounts serve only as an account for collecting&#13;
such taxes and their eventual payment to government. For all other accounts&#13;
potentially there are some interregional transfers, although of course some of&#13;
these may actually be zero because no actual transfers are recorded.&#13;
The essence of the treatment of interregional transfers in our SAM is&#13;
that geographical flows are distinguished from functional flows. More&#13;
specifically, all transactions between accounts are represented as taking&#13;
place within each region, so that interregional transfers simply augment the&#13;
receipts of an account in one region and simultaneously deplete the same&#13;
account in the other region. In Table 8.1 the East to West and West to East&#13;
blocks of elements are set out so that interregional transfers, including&#13;
actual zero flows (represented by zeros) form the diagonal elements. Since&#13;
gross flows are being represented, there are instances in which an East to&#13;
West transaction takes place at the same time as a comparable flow in the&#13;
opposite direction.&#13;
There is a precise correspondence between the entries in Table 8.1&#13;
and the aggregate SAMs for East and West Malaysia previously presented in&#13;
Tables 7.3 and 2.1 respectively. For the most part this correspondence is&#13;
straightforward: for all transactions other than those with accounts 7, 8 and&#13;
9, the entries in Table 8.1 have a one-to-one correspondence with an entry in&#13;
Table 2.1 or Table 7.1. Thus, for example, savings of East Malaysian&#13;
institutions are shown as receipts by East Malaysian capital accounts (number&#13;
6) of 196.8 from households, 106.6 from companies, and 36.8 from government,&#13;
as before. Similar receipts by West Malaysian capital accounts are shown in&#13;
the second block of accounts, again as income for account number 6, but this&#13;
time from West Malaysian institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 221 -&#13;
For transactions involving accounts 7 and 8, that is, regional&#13;
external transactions, the correspondence is almost as straightforward. By&#13;
aggregating the West Malaysia accounts, together with the accounts 7* and 8*&#13;
for the Rest of the World, in all cases but one the external transactions of&#13;
East Malaysia as recorded in Table 7.3 can be obtained. Similarly,&#13;
aggregation of East Malaysia accounts in Table 8.1 and those for the Rest of&#13;
the World produces the external transactions of West Malaysia as recorded in&#13;
Table 2.1, again with one exception. Thus, subject to a caveat, the aggregate&#13;
SAMs for East and West Malaysia are easily obtained from Table 8.1. The&#13;
caveat arises with respect to regional external commodity transactions and&#13;
derives from the conceptual issues to be discussed in Section 8.3. But before&#13;
coming to them, Section 8.2 takes up the prior issues of obtaining consistent&#13;
estimates of transfers within All Malaysia and distinguishing these from&#13;
transactions with the Rest of the World as now defined.&#13;
8.2 Balance of Payments and Aggregate Interregional Transactions for Malaysia&#13;
The disaggregation of external accounts for East and West Malaysia in&#13;
1970 had already been attempted by the Department of Statistics, Kuala Lumpur,&#13;
in a set of provisional estimates.1' These are summarized in Table 8.2. More&#13;
refined figures were available for subsequent years the estimation of which&#13;
had been given priority by the Department. In consequence, the data in Table&#13;
8.2 provide a starting point but there are some unresolved discrepancies which&#13;
show up in part as a lack of complete agreement between the last two columns&#13;
of the table.&#13;

These final columns of Table 8.2 give estimates of transactions which&#13;
are internal to Malaysia as a whole, and are derived from the information in&#13;
previous columns. Thus columns 3 and 4 respectively show receipts and&#13;
expenditures through external transactions for East Malaysia, while columns 5&#13;
and 6 show similar details for West Malaysia. Figures for All Malaysia are&#13;
then given in columns 7 and 8. In deriving these latter figures, internal&#13;
transactions have been netted off, and columns 9 and 10 give alternative&#13;
estimates of these. Thus column (9) is obtained through the accounting&#13;
identity:&#13;
(8.1)   [East Malaysian +[ West Malaysia   _ gAll Malaysial + [Internal&#13;
receipts (3)       receipts (5) J    receipts (7)j     transfers (9J&#13;
while column 10 comes from the alternative identity:&#13;
(8.2) rEast Malaysia   1+ rWest Malaysia   1  [All Malaysia 8       + r Internal&#13;
expenditures (       L texpenditures (6]  expenditures (8j    Ltransfers (10)]&#13;
The difference in details between columns 9 and 10 is partly due to&#13;
rounding errors since the All Malaysia figures in columns 7 and 9 carry one&#13;
fewer digits than the other data. For the rest, the differences reflect the&#13;
provisional nature of the figures, and here the discrepancy for the freight&#13;
and insurance element of merchandise trade is most marked. We shall need to&#13;
discuss this element further at a later stage. Meanwhile, Table 8.3 sets out&#13;
the numbers we have finally adopted.&#13;
In Table 8.3, details of external transactions for both East and West&#13;
Malaysia are taken from earlier chapters. These differ from corresponding&#13;
entries in Table 8.2 for a number of reasons. It may be recalled that for&#13;

West Malaysia our major source has been the National Accounts../ With only&#13;
minor adjustments, the National Accounts are consistent with the Input-Output&#13;
Tables-./ They are not, however, consistent with the Balance of Payments&#13;
estimates for West Malaysia shown in Table 8.2. Thus, although Table 8.1&#13;
shows a current account surplus of 51.5, the figures previously discussed in&#13;
Chapter 6, and shown in Table 6.3, lead to an estimated deficit of 30.0. More&#13;
generally, the details of these alternative estimates shown in columns 5 and 6&#13;
in Tables 8.2 and 8.3, indicate that the magnitudes of gross flows are not in&#13;
serious disagreement: the largest discrepancy is with respect to receipts by&#13;
government of current transfers from abroad, which Table 8.2 shows as 276.0&#13;
while Table 8.3 gives a figure of 247.9. Beyond this, exports differ by 54.8,&#13;
and the combined discrepancy of these two items is enough to reverse the sign&#13;
of the current account Balance of Payments surplus.&#13;
For the East Malaysian accounts there are also discrepancies between&#13;
Tables 8.2 and 8.3, but the reasons for them are different. In Chapter 7,&#13;
figures for trade in goods and services have been taken largely from the&#13;
published Trade Statistics, which show total exports from East Malaysia of&#13;
1310.0 and total imports of 1265.0. This is the major source of discrepancy&#13;
since non-merchandise trade in Table 8.3 is virtually as shown in Table 8.2,&#13;
while for accounts other than commodities, the items in columns 3 and 4 of&#13;
Tables 8.2 and 8.3 are the same. The resulting change in the Balance of&#13;
Payments is from a deficit of 39.1 as recorded in Table 8.2 to one of 8.8&#13;
shown in Table 8.3. In summary therefore, the individual figures for external&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 226 -&#13;
transactions of East and West Malaysia shown in Table 8.3 are consistent with&#13;
those in earlier chapters, and this consistency leads to slight difference! as&#13;
between Table 8.3 and the provisional Balance of Payments figures in Table 8.2&#13;
A final point to note from Table 8.3 concerns the estimates of&#13;
internal transfers, and the consequential estimates for All Malaysia. Column&#13;
9 shows the figures we have finally adopted for these transfers in the light&#13;
of detailed compilations from the Balance of Payments and trade figures. Also&#13;
shown, in columns 10 and 11, are the directions of these internal flows.&#13;
These summarize more detailed estimates for the commodity accounts, which will&#13;
be discussed in the next section. The estimates for government transfers are&#13;
directly obtained from the published Balance of Payments estimates.&#13;
8.3 Disaggregation of Commodity Trade for East and West Malaysia&#13;
The published Trade Statistics include a detailed commodity breakdown&#13;
of merchandise transactions between East and West Malaysia which provides a&#13;
basis for disaggregation of the totals recorded in Table 8.3, both in terms of&#13;
origin/destination of commodity flows and in terms of the 59 commodity groups&#13;
which have been distinguished in the East and West Malaysia SAMs. However,&#13;
before turning to these details, it is important to consider the principles&#13;
involved in accounting for interregional and external trade in a social&#13;
accounting matrix framework. These principles have been virtually neglected&#13;
in the social accounting literature and, apart from the particular interest: in&#13;
integrating the East and West Malaysian SAMS, they are of some general&#13;
interest in developing multi-region accounts.&#13;
Table 8.4 sets out a two-region tableau in which there is no attempt&#13;
to distinguish interregional commodity flows from external transactions, i.e.&#13;
transactions with other parts of the world. The table focusses exclusively on&#13;

commodities and allows each region to have its own commodity accounts. These&#13;
accounts are in balance and, in our particular example, the table can be&#13;
provided with numerical information directly from the separate results for&#13;
East and West Malaysia in previous chapters. As already noted, however, "Rest&#13;
of the World' refers to all areas other than East and West Malaysia. With&#13;
this interpretation, the table is clearly wrong since the Rest of the World&#13;
account is buying and selling the items which constitute East/West trade. The&#13;
table must therefore be modified so as to purge these interregional&#13;
transactions out of the Rest of the World accounts while retaining the&#13;
separate commodity account balances for East and West Malaysia.&#13;
To effect this purging requires that the interregional transacticons&#13;
be disaggregated to distinguish between (i) the commodity content at point of&#13;
origin (i.e. in the commodity markets of East or West Malaysia), and (ii) the&#13;
insurance and freight services which are required to move commodities from the&#13;
market in one region to that in the other. Next, the insurance and freight&#13;
services need to be distinguished according to who supplies them, i.e. as&#13;
between East and West Malaysia and the rest of the world. To facilitate the&#13;
argument, the notation E + W will be used for the flow of goods from East&#13;
Malaysia to West Malaysia; and W + E for similar flows in the opposite&#13;
direction. The notation x(E + W) is then used to denote the value of goods&#13;
shipped from East to West, with the valuation being in terms of the market&#13;
prices of commodities at the point of origin, i.e. East Malaysia in this&#13;
case. By the time these same goods arrive in the commodity markets of West&#13;
Malaysia, their value will be increased to the extent that there are freight&#13;
and insurance charges involved in moving them. Such charges for the flow of&#13;
goods from East to West will be denoted by e(E + W) , w(E + W) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 229 -&#13;
r(E + W) depending on whether the required shipment services are provided by&#13;
East Malaysia, West Malaysia or the Rest of the World.    Notation  x(W + E)&#13;
e(W + E) , w(W + E) and r(W + E) can be defined to cover the parallel&#13;
movement of goods from West Malaysia to East Malaysia.&#13;
With the above notation, various magnitudes can be defined so as to&#13;
recognize that in our SAM compilations, exports of goods are valued f.o.b.&#13;
while imports are valued c.i.f.. Table 8.5 sets out the definitions needed.&#13;
It is worth noting that we have not captured every possibility in this&#13;
schema. For instance, we have purposely excluded the possible East and West&#13;
Malaysian supply of freight and insurance services on goods exported from or&#13;
exported to the rest of the world, viz:    e(R + W), w(E + R)   etc.  These&#13;
elements can easily be accommodated, and could best be shown in a closed,&#13;
three-region system of accounts (East, West and Rest), rather than the open,&#13;
two-region system as we have here 1/&#13;
The first four columns of Table 8.5 decompose the magnitudes in Table&#13;
8.4 which refer to imports and export for East and West Malaysia of goods&#13;
originating in one or other region. Table 8.6 then distributes these&#13;
component items as transactions within and between the commodity markets of&#13;
East and West Malaysia so that a revised version of Table 8.4 is obtained&#13;
which explicitly show interregional transactions between East and West while&#13;
retaining commodity balances within each region.&#13;
Cross-reference between Tables 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 shows that for&#13;
exports the shift from 8.4 to 8.6 is to split East Malaysia revenues from&#13;

interregional trade between incomes derived from producing and moving goods&#13;
from East to West Malaysia, and incomes from moving goods from West Malaysia&#13;
to East Malaysia. The latter item fe(W + E) I is both a receipt and an&#13;
expenditure of the external accounts for East Malaysia when these accounts are&#13;
treated in aggregate, i.e. without reference to the distinction between West&#13;
Malaysia and the Rest of the World as we have done in Chapter 7. But when we&#13;
come to make this distinction, as in Table 8.6, the SAM rule that each&#13;
transaction should be recorded once only comes into force. Accordingly&#13;
e(W + E) becomes a diagonal element in the Table 8.6 format: East Malaysia&#13;
Commodity Accounts receive income for providing services in shipping goods&#13;
from West Malaysia to East Malaysia, and this income is also a cost of the&#13;
East Malaysia commodity accounts because it is part of the amount which must&#13;
be paid for the supply of goods and services available in East Malaysia. Thus&#13;
from the point of view of East Malaysian commodity markets e(W + E) is a&#13;
component of imports of goods originating in West Malaysia valued c.i.f..&#13;
Another component is r(W + E) and this too must be netted off total imports&#13;
c.i.f. of goods originating in West Malaysia to obtain the true interregional&#13;
transfer from West to East Malaysia of x(W + E) + w(W + E) . This item&#13;
r(W + E) is genuinely a revenue for the Rest of the World account. As shown&#13;
in the fifth column of Table 8.5, including it in the appropriate location&#13;
leads to a total revenue for the Rest of the World from East Malaysia which is&#13;
equal to East Malaysia imports from the Rest of the World, valued c.i.f., as&#13;
it should. An entirely parallel approach with respect to West Malaysia&#13;
commodity markets leads to the complete treatment shown in Table 8.6, and thus&#13;
explains how the Rest of the World accounts can be purged of East-West&#13;
trade. It should be noted that in Table 8.6 we have maintained the valuation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 233 -&#13;
of transactions between each of the two regions of Malaysia and Rest of the&#13;
World as being f.o.b. for exports and c.i.f. for imports. This is not only&#13;
formally correct but from the point of view of our focussing on Malaysia it is&#13;
also a desirable treatment. Had we intended to go one stage further and&#13;
represent a completely closed three-region SAM then trade flows to and from&#13;
the rest of the world would also have to be purged of shipping services&#13;
provided by the Malaysian region. As a result, the Rest of the World trade&#13;
flows would no longer be explicitly f.o.b. and c.i.f. in the way that they are&#13;
in Table 8.6.&#13;
Table 8.7 now sets out numerical estimates of interregional and&#13;
external trade for Malaysia according to the above analysis. The data show&#13;
total import and export earnings as in the separate SAMs for East and West&#13;
Malaysia, and interregional transfers of commodities as in Table 8.3. Exports&#13;
to and imports from the rest of the world amount to 5325.6 and 4799.6,&#13;
respectively. Thus there is a surplus from commodity trade of 526.0 as shown&#13;
in the Table 8.3.&#13;
The figures in Table 8.7 have been derived by reference to the&#13;
Balance of Payments Statistics in Table 8.3, supported by the Trade Statistics&#13;
which record the commodity details of East-West merchandise trade. Although&#13;
these details have largely been accepted as published, a few amendments had to&#13;
be made. These partly arose from a comparison of the trade statistics with&#13;
the separate estimates for East and West Malaysia in earlier chapters. Such a&#13;
comparison suggests that there are misclassifications in mapping from SITC to&#13;
the SAM classifications. A few further adjustments derive from the&#13;
observation that for a small number of commodities f.o.b. valuation of&#13;

interregional exports from one region exceeded the c.i.f. valuation of&#13;
interregional imports to the other. Once more, such discrepancies may have&#13;
been due to misclassification, or to timing differences in invoicing imports&#13;
and exports.&#13;
For interregional flows of insurance and freight services, our&#13;
treatment has been a little arbitrary. A total for exports of these services&#13;
from East and West Malaysia of 10.6 is obtained on the basis of figures in&#13;
Table 8.2. This has been assumed to be made up of 5.0 of services exported to&#13;
the rest of the world, and an estimate of 5.6 for interregional services, part&#13;
of which is credited to East Malaysia, and part to West Malaysia. Clearly,&#13;
interregional transfers of these services cannot be greater than the combined&#13;
revenues received (10.6), and on the grounds that at least some must be&#13;
services exported to the rest of the world, it seemed most reasonable to adopt&#13;
the lower of the two estimates of interregional transfers shown in Table&#13;
8.2. To decompose the figure of 5.6 of interregional services, it has simply&#13;
been assumed that 0.3 is services provided by East Malaysia, and 5.3 by West&#13;
Malaysia. Equally arbitrarily, 0.1 of the 0.3 has been assumed to be services&#13;
provided by East Malaysia on imports into East Malaysia from West Malaysia:&#13;
the remaining 0.2 is therefore services provided by East Malaysia on its&#13;
exports to West Malaysia. Similarly, the services provided by West Malaysia&#13;
on its imports from East Malaysia are estimated as 2.0.&#13;
These assumptions plus detailed analysis of the Trade Statistics lead&#13;
to the estimates of commodity and service trade set out in Table 8.8. The&#13;
table shows a commodity disaggregation of the figures in Table 8.7 from the&#13;
revenue (export) point of view. The same aggregate numbers are shown in&#13;
commodity detail in terms of imports in Table 8.9.&#13;

For interregional trade the distinction between the data in Tables&#13;
8.8 and 8.9 is strictly analogous to that between commodity transactions at&#13;
basic versus market prices as discussed in Chapter 5. Thus exports in the&#13;
interregional context record merchandise commodity flows excluding freight and&#13;
insurance charges, which are separately shown as an aggregate export of the&#13;
commodity group(s) which supply insurance and freight services. On the import&#13;
side, however, the freight and insurance services are included in the&#13;
valuation of the merchandise items and therefore do not appear separately.&#13;
Since we have no other basis for measuring the incidence of these items, in&#13;
compiling Table 8.9 it has simply been assumed that the provision of freight&#13;
and insurance services by one region on its imports from the other is evenly&#13;
distributed across the range of items which are traded. Because the numbers&#13;
involved are small, an alternative, more accurate procedure is unlikely to&#13;
affect the figures significantly.&#13;
The fact that local provision of insurance and freight services for&#13;
interregional trade involves relatively small numbers is due in part to the&#13;
fact that interregional trade is only a small part of trade for either&#13;
region. Also, of course, it confirms the function of Singapore as an entrepot&#13;
for much of East/West trade, and as such it appears as part of the Rest of the&#13;
World rather than by East or West Malaysiaa activities. It therefore follows&#13;
that in this case no serious error would have been introduced by a less&#13;
rigorous approach to regional trade than ti-e formally correct method which is&#13;
set out in Table 8.6.&#13;

8.4 Alternative SAMS for All Malaysia&#13;
The discussion in the previous section resolves our final difficulty&#13;
in defining a SAM for Malaysia. From thi£i point on the interesting questions&#13;
concern the presentation and manipulation of the SAM data rather than its&#13;
conceptual foundations. This final section can only touch on these issues&#13;
since we have chosen to end this volume al: a point where the data base is&#13;
poised for subsequent analytical use. We therefore restrict ourselves at this&#13;
stage to alternative presentations of the data on aggregate flows which is&#13;
given in Table 8.1, and leave final discutision of disaggregations within these&#13;
details until our concluding chapter.&#13;
Obvious tabulations to derive from the aggregate regional SAM shown&#13;
as Table 8.1 are the respective aggregate SAMs for East and West Malaysia&#13;
shown as Tables 7.3 and 2.1, respectively, They can be obtained in a&#13;
relatively straightforward manner. To obt:ain the aggregate SAM for East&#13;
Malaysia involves three steps:&#13;
(i)    Consolidate the current accounts for West Malaysia (accounts 1 to 5&#13;
and 9 to 11) with the Rest of the World current account (account&#13;
7*).&#13;
(ii)   Consolidate the capital account: for West Malaysia. (account 6) with&#13;
that for the Rest of the World (account 8*).&#13;
(iii)  Set the diagonal entry in the East Malaysia commodity accounts&#13;
equal to zero, and add the inil:ial entry as both a reccipt and an&#13;
expenditure of the East Malaysia commodity account in its&#13;
transactions with the consolidated account formed in step (i)&#13;
above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 240 -&#13;
Strictly analogous steps, with the roles of East and West Malaysia reversed,&#13;
yields the West Malaysia SAM shown as Table 2.1.&#13;
The logic of the first two of these steps is evident from the&#13;
definition of the Rest of the World, from East Malaysia's point of view, as&#13;
the aggregation of West Malaysia and the Rest of the World as defined in Table&#13;
8.1. The third step follows from the discussion in the previous section of&#13;
the present chapter. The essence of that discussion is that external&#13;
transactions, which record exports f.o.b. and imports c.i.f., involve an&#13;
element of double counting. Specifically, the insurance and freight service&#13;
charges which a country earns in bringing goods from foreign markets to its&#13;
own appears both as an export earning and as part of imports valued c.i.f..&#13;
This double counting is avoided, while account balances are retained, by&#13;
treating these export earnings as an internal transfer within domestic&#13;
commodity markats which is therefore excluded both from exports and, on a&#13;
commodity by commodity basis, from import costs. If such a procedure is&#13;
followed for all regions, then the aggregate SAM for any one region can be&#13;
obtained by consolidation of the accounts for all other regions. A subsequent&#13;
step is then needed to obtain import and export figures on the conventional&#13;
basis: the double counting has to be reinstated by an adjustment of the tylpe&#13;
specified in step 3 above.&#13;
The simplest way of obtaining an aggregate SAM for All Malaysia from&#13;
the data of Table 8.1 is to consolidate each of the various accounts for East&#13;
Malaysia with the corresponding account for West Malaysia. In this way an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 241 -&#13;
11 x 11 SAM can be obtained with Rest of the World accounts corresponding to&#13;
accounts 7* and 8* in Table 8.1.2/&#13;
An alternative procedure for deriving an aggregate All Malaysia SAM&#13;
involves first a rearrangement of Table 8.1 as in Table 8.10. This is simply&#13;
a matter of re-ordering rows and columns. In Table 8.1, the internal accounts&#13;
are ordered first by region and then by type of account: in Table 8.2 the&#13;
ordering is reversed so that the table begins with Wants accounts for East,&#13;
then West Malaysia; then Factor accounts for East and West Malaysia; and so&#13;
on.&#13;
This reordering of accounts with a regional dimension has some&#13;
interesting implications,2/   One is that all interregional transactions appear&#13;
in one or other of the diagonal sub-blocks of Table 8.10. And within these&#13;
sub-blocks or partitions, they appear as off-diagonal elements. Thus their&#13;
character as a transfer payment from the point of view of the aggregate region&#13;
is captured, while their status as transactions between regions is retained.&#13;
Table 8.10 lends itself to a partial aggregation of accounts. It has&#13;
been noted previously that for some accounts a regional disaggregation is not&#13;
entirely meaningful. Thus to the extent that Government provides public goods&#13;
to all regions, its regional disaggregation is somewhat meaningless.&#13;
Similarly, there is little point in a regional disaggregation of the company&#13;
sector since corporate location within All Malaysia has relatively little&#13;
1/ The results which this yields are given in Table 8.12.&#13;
2/ Stone (1961b) discusses formats such as Tables 8.1 and 8.10 in some&#13;
detail.&#13;

significance. A homogeneous capital market, in the sense of a preponderance&#13;
of nationwide financial institutions, has similar implications for the&#13;
combined capital account. Hence in all these cases the separate regional&#13;
accounts in Table 8.10 have little merit and can therefore be consolidated&#13;
without serious loss.&#13;
It has also been noted previously that interregional transactions for&#13;
Wants, Activities and Indirect taxes are logically excluded. There is&#13;
therefore no loss of information involved in suppressing the regional&#13;
dimension by consolidation in these cases also.&#13;
Applying these consolidations to Table 8.10 results in the simpler&#13;
SAM shown as Table 8.11. Since it has been argued that little if any&#13;
meaningful information has been lost in the transition, the simpler Table 8.11&#13;
is to be preferred. It retains a regional dimension only with respect to&#13;
factors, households and commodities. And for factors and households it is no&#13;
surprise to find that a regional dimension is an attractive feature: the same&#13;
considerations are implicit in the discussion of Chapter 3 on criteria for&#13;
disaggregation of factor and household accounts. There it was argued in the&#13;
context of Peninsular Malaysia that an urban/rural distinction is important.&#13;
Now, in the context of All Malaysia, the regional dimension is retained as an&#13;
informative disaggregation criterion.&#13;
Given this common feature between the earlier treatment of Peninsular&#13;
Malaysia and the present treatment of All Malaysia, it is apparent that what&#13;
gives Table 8.11 a distinctly regional character is the recognition of&#13;
separate regional commodity accounts corresponding to distinct commodity&#13;
markets. Naturally, these markets are linked by trade, but the fact of having&#13;

separate markets for commodities in East and West Malaysia is the fundamental&#13;
conceptual difference between a national and regional SAM.&#13;
Having arrived at Table 8.11, it would be possible to provide a more&#13;
detailed table on the basis of earlier results. For West Malaysia we could&#13;
have up to 51 different factors, 33 household types and 59 commodities. For&#13;
East Malaysia, results in Chapter 7 allow disaggregation up to four different&#13;
factors, one household type and 59 commodities. Results in Section 3 of the&#13;
present chapter allow the two separate sets of commodity transactions to be&#13;
linked so as to obtain consistent details on trade between the regions and&#13;
between each region and the rest of the world. Accordingly, Table 8.11 could&#13;
be presented with these detailed disaggregations of accounts to yield a final&#13;
SAM as the culmination of the present study. We have refrained from doing so&#13;
only because the piece of paper required would be impractically large. In&#13;
principle, however, this large SAM exists. Its details are contained within&#13;
our results and can be extracted from them.&#13;
As an alternative to expanding Table 8.11 by showing detailed&#13;
disaggregations, the table can be condensed to yield an All Malaysia SAM as in&#13;
Table 8.12. This requires only that the separate East and West Malaysia&#13;
accounts for Factors, Households and Commodities be consolidated to a single&#13;
All Malaysia account in each case. For commodities this means that the two&#13;
separate commodity markets are treated as one. Their consolidation implies&#13;
not only that the commodity accounts for East and West Malaysia are&#13;
aggregated, but also that the diagonal entry in the new combined commodity&#13;
account is set equal to zero. Thus transactions which depend on the separate&#13;

existence of distinct markets are suppressed when the distinction is&#13;
dropped -&#13;
As a final exercise, the results in Table 8.12 can be condensed into&#13;
a set of national accounts for All Malaysia as in Table 8.13. The procedures&#13;
are identical to those discussed in Chapter 2 when the national accounts for&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia were derived from the Peninsular aggregate SAM shown as&#13;
Table 2.1. Thus Table 8.13 corresponds exactly to Table 2.2. The former&#13;
shows that for All Malaysia the GDP at factor cost in 1970 was 10601.1 while&#13;
disposable national income at market prices was 11838.3. Deriving these&#13;
numbers has hardly been the purpose of this volume. Yet in concluding the&#13;
presentation with them, we can end as we began by asking: who gets what out&#13;
of the national income? The analysis presented here tries to go some way&#13;
towards an answer for Malaysia in 1970.&#13;
1/ To retain such items would involve double counting. For example, imports&#13;
of East Malaysia from West appear on the diagonal as a result of aggre-&#13;
gation. But such imports also appear as a purchase of All Malaysia&#13;
commodity accounts from West Malaysia production activities. Hence&#13;
retention of the diagonal element would double count this item in&#13;
commodity supplies.&#13;

CHAPTER 9&#13;
RESULTS AND REFLECTIONS&#13;
9.1 Consolidated Classification Scheme&#13;
Throughout the previous chapters it has been apparent that the&#13;
disaggregations and classifications for Wants, Factors, Households and&#13;
Production have been about as detailed as the source data could sustain. It&#13;
will be recalled that, for West Malaysia, the Household Income/Expenditure&#13;
SurveyL' has provided the basis for the mapping of factors incomes to&#13;
households; while the Labour Force Survey component of the same data set has&#13;
provided the necessary basis for the mapping of value added from production&#13;
activity accounts to factors. Further disaggregation of these survey results&#13;
would have exacerbated our problems in having to deal with base data in which&#13;
a number of cell entries are based on very few observations. In this respect,&#13;
then, the classifications that have been adopted for Peninsular Malaysia&#13;
represent a limit of meaningful disaggregation based on these sources. One&#13;
consequence is that some of the estimates in earlier chapters are subject to&#13;
rather wide margins of uncertainty, even though these margins are narrower&#13;
than they would have been without the benefit of the inherent constraints that&#13;
the SAM framework provides.&#13;
These arguments suggest that for many purposes it may be preferable&#13;
to work at a less disaggregated level than the one we have attempted. Also,&#13;
some of our earlier analysis suggests that, in some instances, aspects of the&#13;
classification criteria which we have previously adopted turn out to be of&#13;
relatively little significance in defining groups which are significantly&#13;

different. A case in point arises with respect to the race dimension of the&#13;
factor accounts.&#13;
The factor accounts for West Malaysia, discussed in Chapter 4,&#13;
involve a classification of labor according to location (urban/rural),&#13;
education level and race; as well as by industry of employment and household&#13;
group. As was noted in Chapter 4, the results of estimating a wage matrix for&#13;
these various labor types showed that the most significant influences on&#13;
income stemmed from education level and industry of employment. Furthermore,&#13;
the race dimension appears to have the least explanatory power in this&#13;
context, in comparison not only with education but also relative to the&#13;
locational dimension. It emerges, therefore, that apparent wage differences&#13;
between ethnic groups can largely be explained by these other labor&#13;
characteristics. Accordingly, the race dimension can be dropped as a labor&#13;
classification criterion for many purposes.&#13;
In contrast with the factor accounts, it is especially important to&#13;
retain the race dimension as a classification criterion for households, and&#13;
hence as an aspect of the distribution of income across institutions. This is&#13;
because ethnic differences in living standards are a primary consideration in&#13;
the context of planning and government policy in Malaysia. Thus the relevance&#13;
of the SAM for policy purposes depends significantly on this feature, which&#13;
our analysis has shown is contingent on the location and factor endowments of&#13;
households of different ethnic groups.&#13;
Given the above considerations and a general desire to produce a&#13;
smaller, more manageable SAM for subsequent analytical purposes, Table 9.1&#13;
sets out a less detailed set of disaggregations and classifications than those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 251 -&#13;
we have previously worked with. They have been derived with reference both to&#13;
our sense of the accuracy of results previously obtained, and by suppressing&#13;
details of classification which have turned out to be of little numerical&#13;
significance. Beyond this, the detail in the activity and commodity accounts&#13;
has been reduced in line with conventional criteria for sectoral definitions.&#13;
Table 9.1 sets out the new classifications and shows their&#13;
relationship to the old ones. The Wants accounts have been reduced from 33 to&#13;
20; the Commodity accounts from 59 to 26; and the Production Activities are&#13;
now shown in 21 separate accounts rather than 30. As regards the Factor and&#13;
Household accounts, these previously contained a considerable disaggregation&#13;
for West Malaysia (51 and 33 accounts respectively). Suppressing the ethnic&#13;
dimension in the labor classification for West Malaysia, together with some&#13;
consolidation of the groups defined by education level, now reduces the&#13;
disaggregation in the factor accounts as a whole to only 9 categories. Less&#13;
drastically, the household accounts have been reduced to 20 categories. This&#13;
has been achieved first by combining households whose heads are employers with&#13;
those in which the head is an own account worker. Secondly, all employment&#13;
status categories have been combined for those households whose members belong&#13;
to the ethnic class 'others'. This reduced amount of detail still allows a&#13;
good deal of scope in defining household groups and for identifying important&#13;
distributional issues between major socio-economic categories.&#13;

9.2 A West Malaysia SAM&#13;
Tables 9.2 to 9.6 set out the SAM for West Malaysia which is obtained&#13;
when the results in Chapters 3 to 6 are consolidated into the less&#13;
disaggregated schema defined in Table 9.1. It is to be noted that in these&#13;
tables, previous results are rounded up to the nearest million M$, and that&#13;
the Rest of the World is defined from the perspective of West Malaysia, i.e.&#13;
it includes East Malaysia. Indeed, Tables 9.2 to 9.5 are fully consistent&#13;
with the results in Chapters 3 to 6 and are simply an aggregation of them -&#13;
from 212 accounts as in Table 2.4 to 102 accounts as defined in Table 9.1.&#13;
Here as elsewhere in this chapter, the notation * is used to indicate a&#13;
magnitude less than 0.5m Malay dollars.&#13;
The presentation in Tables 9.2 to 9.6 is from the outlay point of&#13;
view. Thus Table 9.2 gives the outlay accounts for Wants; Table 9.3 is for&#13;
institutions; Table 9.4 refers to commodities; Table 9.5 to activities; and&#13;
Table 9.6 gives all other outlay accounts, including those for factors. In&#13;
effect, laying these six tables side by side provides the full SAM for West&#13;
Malaysia according to the Table 9.1 classification scheme.&#13;
9.3 An East Malaysia SAM&#13;
Tables 9.7 to 9.10 set out a SAM for East Malaysia corresponding to&#13;
the West Malaysia SAM of Tables 9.2 to 9.6. In this case the SAM is somewhat&#13;
simpler since, as explained in Chapter 7, the disaggregation of the labor&#13;
factor accounts and those for households has not been attempted because of&#13;
lack of primary data. As indicated in Table 9.1, the level of disaggregation&#13;
for factors and institutions is the same at this stage as in Chapter 7. Hence&#13;
the consolidations reflected in Tables 9.7 to 9.10 are restricted to the Wants&#13;
accounts (Table 9.7); the Commodity accounts (Table 9.8) and the Activity&#13;
accounts (Table 9.9). All other outlay accounts for East Malaysia are given&#13;
in Table 9.10.&#13;

9.4 An All Malaysia SAM with Regional Components&#13;
In Table 8.11 an aggregate SAM for All Malaysia has been set out&#13;
whicly retains certain aspects of the regional distinction between East and&#13;
West Malaysia. The disaggregated SAM presented in this section is similar in&#13;
spirit. It contains separate household and factor accounts for East and West&#13;
Malaysia, following the details for classification given in Table 9.1.&#13;
Similarly, as in Table 8.11, there is no regional distinction in the accounts&#13;
for Companies, Government, Activities and Indirect taxes, nor for the combined&#13;
capital account for domestic institutions. Hence the only departure from the&#13;
format of Table 8.11 is in the treatment of commodities. In Table 8.11,&#13;
commodity transactions are shown separately for East and West Malaysia. Here&#13;
these two sets of commodity accounts are to be combined so that, in Table 9.13&#13;
below, there are just 26 outlay accounts for commodities, corresponding to the&#13;
classification definitions given in Table 9.1.&#13;
In combining the separate regional commodity accounts in this way, it&#13;
is necessary to suppress the freight and insurance earnings of each region in&#13;
providing its own imports. The arguments for doing so have been discussed in&#13;
Chapter 8. If such transactions were to be retained then double-counting of&#13;
these elements would be involved in the computation of commodity supplies.&#13;
This is because they are an element both of a region's imports and of its&#13;
exports as discussed in Chapter 8. By suppressing these elements in the&#13;
commodity accounts, the gross outputs for activities in All Malaysia are&#13;
simply obtained as sums of gross outputs in each region. But commodity&#13;
supplies are no longer simple sums because such a procedure would involve an&#13;
element of double counting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 270 -&#13;
Corresponding to the consolidation of the separate regional accounts&#13;
for commodities, the rest of the world is now defined as all territory outside&#13;
Malaysia as a whole. Chapter 8 has shown how the corresponding import and&#13;
export figures can be estimated. These results are now used in the present&#13;
SAM at the 26-commodity level of detail as set out in Table 9.1.&#13;
The results for our All Malaysia SAM are presented in Tables 9.11 to&#13;
9.15.  Again the presentation is from the outlay perspective.    Thus Table 9.11&#13;
gives the outlay accounts for wants for All Malaysia and is simply an&#13;
aggregation of the similar tables for West and East Malaysia shown as Tables&#13;
9.2 and 9.7. Next, Table 9.12 brings together the detail on institutions&#13;
current accounts from Tables 9.3 (West Malaysia) and 9.10 (East Malaysia).&#13;
The All Malaysia commodity accounts are then given in Table 9.13. In Table&#13;
9.14 the activities accounts for West (Table 9.5) and East Malaysia (Table&#13;
9.9) are brought together. And finally, in Table 9.15, the All Malaysia&#13;
outlay accounts for factors (showing East and West separately) are presented,&#13;
together with the outlay accounts for the domestic institutions capital&#13;
account, the indirect tax account and the external (rest of the world)&#13;
accounts. This final table therefore combines results from Tables 9.6 and&#13;
9.10 which have set out the corresponding detail separately for each region.&#13;
9.5 Reflections on the Study&#13;
The various SAMs set out in previous sections of this chapter and,&#13;
more generally, throughout this book can be used for a variety of purposes.&#13;
But in the first instance they are intended to be read, since the primary&#13;
purpose of Tables 9.2 to 9.15 is to describe how the economy of Malaysia stood&#13;
in 1970 from different points of view. The tables describe the structure of&#13;

consumption, production, investment and trade. But they also do far more than&#13;
this in showing how these different aspects of structure are interrelated, one&#13;
with another, and with the household and factoral distributions of income.&#13;
Thus the tables facilitate quantitative thought about how changes in one part&#13;
of the structure will have consequences for another. Not least, one can trace&#13;
through the tables the potential impact of some exogenous change, such as a&#13;
change in government expenditure, on each of the different household groups&#13;
within the economy, and hence on the level and distribution of income.&#13;
From the perspective of a national accounts statistician, the main&#13;
feature of the approach to SAMs in this volume may be the attempt to forge&#13;
detailed and consistent links between value added and final demand via the&#13;
income and outlay accounts for factors and institutions. Such consistency is&#13;
an obvious goal in national income computations. However, the usual approach&#13;
to it is via the commodity and activity accounts. Following this normal&#13;
approach, value added, disaggregated by activities, can be estimated in a&#13;
manner which is consistent with final demand disaggregated by commodities.&#13;
And it is this latter approach which has been used in computing the National&#13;
Accounts for Malaysia, which accordingly represent contemporary best practice&#13;
procedures for such computations. However, our concern in this study (and in&#13;
earlier onesI/) has been to go beyond these established procedures and to&#13;
subject the national accounts estimates to a further set of restrictions.&#13;
Thus the consistency which is a novel feature in our work is to require value&#13;
added, disaggregated by factors, to be consistent with final demands,&#13;
1/ See, for example, Pyatt and Roe with Lindley, Round and others (1977), and&#13;
Pyatt and Round (1977).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

disaggregated by institutions, and for this second set of consistency&#13;
requirements to be obtained via the detailed income and outlay accounts for&#13;
factors and institutions.&#13;
There can be no doubt that if national income was initially estimated&#13;
subject to both sets of restrictions, then superior estimates of the national&#13;
accounts would emerge. In this field additional consistency checks can&#13;
invariably work towards improved estimates. However, in the present study we&#13;
have not tried to re-estimate the national income, but rather have taken the&#13;
national income estimates derived via the commodity/activity balance approach&#13;
as datum. This is because we have not wanted to change figures which have&#13;
previously been established. In consequence, the second type of consistency,&#13;
i.e. that which is obtained via the factor and institutions accounts, has had&#13;
to be achieved entirely by adjustment of the flows through these accounts.&#13;
Hence, rather than use both types of consistency simultaneously, our method in&#13;
this volume has been a sequential one. A consequence is that the potential&#13;
gain in accuracy from use of the more general, simultaneous approach has been&#13;
sacrificed. The extent of this sacrifice shows up in the difficulties of&#13;
reconciliation which we have had to face, and in the various adjustment&#13;
factors which it has been necessary to invoke. The extent to which these&#13;
pragmatic procedures are thought to be unacceptable or to result in doubtful&#13;
figures, is one measure of the sacrifice involved in treating the national&#13;
accounts as previously estimated as sacrosanct.&#13;
This way of expressing the role of factor and institution accounts in&#13;
our procedures suggests that they represent a way of improving SAM&#13;
estimation. This is correct. But it also misses an important aspect. The&#13;
emphasis previously in national accounts compilation has encouraged increasing&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

detail in activity and commodity accounts, involving large input-output tables&#13;
as a result. From a number of points of view this is a misplaced emphasis.&#13;
To the extent that policy is concerned with the living standards of different&#13;
groups in society, the disaggregation of institution and factor accounts is at&#13;
a premium, and the case for disaggregated production accounts derived from&#13;
their relevance in explaining the living standards of different groups. But&#13;
it is the living standards of these groups which should be the starting&#13;
point. It was a natural starting point for the pioneers of national&#13;
accounting,-L/ and in our view it should be re-established as such if the&#13;
object is to serve a development strategy which has the raising of living&#13;
standards and equitable sharing in growth as its objectives. From this&#13;
perspective, the main thrust of developments in national accounting for&#13;
developing countries in recent years has been misguided.&#13;
An approach to SAMs which emphasizes living standards via the income&#13;
and outlay accounts for different institutions and factors has to be based on&#13;
a high-quality survey of household income and expenditure patterns, and a&#13;
similar survey for the corporate sector. We have therefore been particularly&#13;
fortunate that such basic data is available for Malaysia, as well as a first-&#13;
rate set of national accounts compiled according to SNA recommendations. In&#13;
other countries it would be rare to have such material, and in those cases&#13;
where household surveys do exist, we know of no case where major discrepancies&#13;

(1976).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

between survey results and national accounts has not been revealed.-Y Nor is&#13;
it obvious that such discrepancies should be read simply as a reflection of&#13;
poor quality in survey results. It is quite reasonable to impute some of the&#13;
discrepancy to bad national income estimation. From this point it follows&#13;
that national income estimation could be improved by reference to household&#13;
survey results.&#13;
These arguments imply an orientation for household surveys in the&#13;
income distribution field which has previously been lacking. Until now, such&#13;
surveys have typically been designed to provide weights for a cost-of-living&#13;
index and perhaps for other ad hoc purposes also. Only occasionally are they&#13;
conceived as a way of monitoring living standards, and when they are, the&#13;
initial design is innocent of any thoughts about using the survey results as a&#13;
starting point for national income estimation.&#13;
If survey results on the income and outlay accounts for factors and&#13;
are to be used as an (initial) ingredient of national accounts compilation,&#13;
then questions inevitably arise as to appropriate methods for reconciling&#13;
inconsistent estimates of particular numbers within a SAM. This is simply&#13;
because we can expect substantial discrepancies between survey results and&#13;
previous methods of estimating national income. Much of this book has been&#13;
taken up with discussion of the methods which we have used to resolve&#13;
discrepancies. These methods are essentially informal, involving judgement&#13;
and sub-routines (such as RAS) which have been invoked as and when we have&#13;

felt them to be appropriate. In consequence the results depend significantly&#13;
on the discretion we have exercised. Some element of this general approach is&#13;
inevitable if final tables, uncluttered with numerous residual balancing&#13;
errors, are to be avoided. However, opportunities are now becoming available&#13;
for reduced reliance on subjective methods, thanks to recent developments in&#13;

how these contributions might best be exploited.&#13;
The reorientationiof national accounts which we have tried to&#13;
illustrate in this volume provides a fresh starting point for discussion of&#13;
systems of classification. In the first instance, the question is how to&#13;
define the household groups whose living standards are to be quantified. In&#13;
Chapter 3 we have discussed this issue, and argued in favor of socioeconomic&#13;
categories as opposed to a grouping based on income levels. In addition to&#13;
location and race, our preferred criterion is the occupational status of the&#13;
household's main earner. It is no coincidence that this was Gregory King's&#13;
preferred criterion, since it is perhaps self-evident that this is the natural&#13;
way to disaggregate a society which is composed of family units.&#13;
Starting from this perspective of the appropriate taxonomy for social&#13;
stratification, the next step is to decide how factors should be classified.&#13;
The ownership of factors underlies the primary source of income for&#13;
households, which is from the provision of factor services. Hence the mapping&#13;
we show from factors to institutions (matrix    T3.2) is essentially determined&#13;
1/  Stone discusses a method in his foreward to Pyatt and Roe with Lindley,&#13;
Round and others (1977).   This has been developed subsequently by Byron&#13;
(1978).  An alternative, more recent contribution, is the work of Ranier&#13;
von Saleski (1977), using a network approach as a special case of linear&#13;
programming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 281 -&#13;
by the distribution of wealth in the form of ownership of the factors of&#13;
production. This distribution therefore includes labor endowments, which are&#13;
the crucial determinant of incomes for many.&#13;
Debate on the role of education in the determination of wage&#13;
differentials has been extensive and will no doubt continue. Meanwhile the&#13;
statistical evidence (to which this study adds) continues to build up in favor&#13;
of regarding education level as a primary criterion for the disaggregation of&#13;
the labor force. Location also matters in our results, and one of our more&#13;
interesting findings is that differences by race can be accounted for by these&#13;
sets of considerations. A limitation of our work has been the failure to&#13;
treat sex as an additional distinguishing characteristic of labor.&#13;
The choice of taxonomies for households and labor go a long way to&#13;
conditioning the type of model which can be built on the data base we have&#13;
provided. In classifying households in terms of occupation, and labor by&#13;
educational level, it is implicitly assumed that labor incomes depend more on&#13;
the latter than the former. This is not something we have tested directly.&#13;
However, our analysis in Chapter 4 has investigated the relationship between&#13;
wage income and industry of employment. Unfortunately the results here are&#13;
subject to statistical difficulties in reconciling survey results and national&#13;
accounts aggregates when the latter are treated as datum. But even so, the&#13;
methods adopted do provide an interesting alternative to estimating earnings&#13;
functions by regression methods, and they do indicate that industry of&#13;
emloyment is of some importance in determining earnings.&#13;
Given these findings it is to be regretted that our study has simply&#13;
adopted an industrial classification from the published national accounts.&#13;
This is based purely on the grouping of establishments by commodity produced,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 282 -&#13;
and therefore entirely ignores the level of technology being adopted. The&#13;
model of production which underlies conventional national accounts assumes&#13;
explicitly that there is a unique technology for producing each commodity.&#13;
This assumption flies in the face of all the evidence on the importance of&#13;
technological duality in developing countries. It is therefore a major&#13;
limitation on the usefulness of our work that we have not been able to abandon&#13;
the conventional classification scheme. Unless and until technical duality is&#13;
captured as an essential dimension of production statistics, the relevance of&#13;
national accounts to the issues we know to be fundamental will remain&#13;
seriously circumscribed. In separating out the accounts for activities from&#13;
those for commodities, the way is open for using criteria other than the&#13;
commodities produced as a basis for disaggregating activities. Thus national&#13;
income accounting need not be bound by the Leontief model. The opportunities&#13;
which this presents have yet to be seized, and our knowledge of development is&#13;
the worse for it.&#13;
In basing our approach to labor incomes on a manpower matrix, an&#13;
initial link is forged between the SAM and the broad range of demographic&#13;
statistics. More broadly, our general philosophy puts considerable emphasis&#13;
on the need to integrate social statistics with the major economic data&#13;
system. In this area the main example is, of course, with respect to income&#13;
distribution, and here we think we have made a significant start. But there&#13;
are other possibilities which could and should be developed, starting with the&#13;
link between the labor endowments of each household type and the manpower&#13;
matrix description of employment by factor types and activities.&#13;
Going beyond labor endowment statistics into the other aspects of&#13;
wealth distribution is an obvious priority. Equally, data collection in this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 283 -&#13;
area raises many problems which might be considered insuperable in particular&#13;
cases. However, it should be noted that without a comprehensive set of data&#13;
on assets, the chances for improved estimation of savings, investment and the&#13;
flow of funds is strictly limited. Yet quite apart from the intrinsic&#13;
interest of the distribution of wealth in its own right, flow of funds&#13;
questions are being recognized increasingly as key elements in the&#13;
determination of how the distribution of income evolves over time.&#13;
Setting aside questions of wealth distribution, other areas exist in&#13;
which an integration of social and economic statistics is called for. As the&#13;
work of Meerman (1978) and (1980) illustrates, it is perfectly possible, and&#13;
instructive, to treat public expenditures on certain services - health and&#13;
education are prime examples - as income transfers from Government to the&#13;
households of various types who receive these services. Such a treatment&#13;
obviously enhances the view of income distribution which otherwise emerges,&#13;
and it provides a crucial link between the current transactions of Government&#13;
and the living standards of the people whom it is concerned to serve.&#13;
Questions of living standards can be taken a step further in our&#13;
framework by reference to the accounts for wants. As presented in this study,&#13;
the accounts for wants are simply a set of commodity accounts in which it is&#13;
convenient to express household expenditures. But there is no reason in&#13;
principle why wants cannot be defined in terms of access to needs (adequate&#13;
diet, clean water, sanitation, education, etc.) thus forging a major new link&#13;
with social statistics. Clearly there are many conceptual issues to be&#13;
resolved if this approach were to be pursued. But for now it may be useful&#13;
simply to point out the possibility, or rather to express the view that an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 284 -&#13;
integration of social and economic statistics in this area requires that the&#13;
conceptual problems can be resolved.&#13;
Most of the above points relate to issues which are not&#13;
conventionally treated in national accounts and which we would like to bring&#13;
into the forefront of discussion for the future. However, even in those areas&#13;
which are conventionally treated, we have problems with the conventions. The&#13;
previous discussion of activity classifications in relation to technology is a&#13;
case in point.&#13;
A further area in which we feel that current conventions are&#13;
inappropriate is in the treatment of commodity transactions at basic, as&#13;
opposed to market prices. Chapter 5 has discussed this issue at length. It&#13;
ultimately reduces to a question of the model which underlies the accounting&#13;
framework. In rejecting the fixed coefficients commodity technology model, we&#13;
recognize that distribution plays an important part in determining the prices&#13;
that households pay for goods, and that these prices can differ substantially&#13;
by virtue of alternative distribution channels. At one extreme, market prices&#13;
and producer prices are the same for subsistence households, but they can be&#13;
very different for others. If these differences in prices are to be captured,&#13;
then there is no alternative but to recognize different commodities according&#13;
to different marketing arrangements. The treatment of commodity accounts at&#13;
basic prices is simply an artificial construction which reduces the value of&#13;
the data by facilitating a reduction in the detail of commodity accounts at&#13;
the cost of masking important differences as between domestic and export sale&#13;
prices or between consumption of own produce and the same goods as channeled&#13;
through wholesale and retail outlets.&#13;

Our analysis of East Malaysia in Chapter 7 is at worst a rather&#13;
tedious exercise which is necessary to move from the rich data sources for&#13;
West Malaysia to an All Malaysia set of accounts. However, we would like to&#13;
accord the analysis in Chapter 7 a somewhat higher status, as an example of&#13;
how data for one economy might be borrowed, to calibrate a SAM for some&#13;
other. Such a procedure may be alien to conventional statisticians. But in&#13;
practice such procedures are being used in less systematic fashion in many&#13;
countries and the issue should be to obtain the best possible estimates from&#13;
whatever sources are available. Thus the invocation attributed to some&#13;
statisticians: "no number can be more accurate than no number", runs&#13;
diametrically across our perception of the right approach. Where the reader&#13;
comes out on these issues will depend on their balance between the need for&#13;
some quantitative basis for policy, and the nature of the responsibility which&#13;
goes with being a purvevor of information to decision-makers.&#13;
Putting together the SAMs for East and West Malaysia has raised&#13;
conceptual issues of regional accounting which we try to resolve in Chapter&#13;
8. Numerically what is at stake here hardly justifies the depth of our&#13;
discussion. But in the broader context of the general desire to have more of&#13;
a regional nature included within the national accounts, it is important to&#13;
get the conceptual issues straight; and this is what we hope to have done.&#13;
In reaching the end of this study we are conscious that we have&#13;
produced an elaborate and intricate text which relentlessly pursues&#13;
consistency at the expense of broader discussion of the issues which are&#13;
touched on in this final section and at various points in earlier chapters.&#13;
It is left to the reader to decide whether our efforts support their avowed&#13;
objective of seeking a reorientation of national accounts away from production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 286 -&#13;
toward giving primacy to the question: who gets what? In this study we have&#13;
tried to demonstrate that much can be done towards this end. But if the&#13;
reader is not already apprised of the importance of this end, then, to pursue&#13;
the point requires the further exercise of showing how the data can be used&#13;
for policy purposes. Applications have not been discussed here and remain for&#13;
subsequent publications.&#13;
It has taken many years for national income accounts to reach their&#13;
present level of sophistication. It may take many more before they are&#13;
simplified and reoriented in the direction we favor.&#13;

TECHNICAL APPENDIX: THE RAS METHOD&#13;
The RAS method is a technique for modifying a non-negative matrix&#13;
A in such a way that a new matrix is formed which is also non-negative and&#13;
has the property that its row and column totals are given by pre-assigned&#13;
values. Thus A has row totals Ai and column totals (in row vector form)&#13;
i'A . Let x be the desired row totals, and let y' be the desired column&#13;
totals. Then the problem is to form a new matrix B by modification of the&#13;
matrix A such that&#13;
(A.1)    Bi  =  x    and     i'B  = y&#13;
The RAS method solves this problem by defining B as&#13;
(A.2)    r As      B&#13;
where r and s are diagonal matrices. The notation on the left-hand side&#13;
of equation (A.2) is the source of the name 'RAS method'. It has been used&#13;
extensively in estimation and updating of input-output tables following its&#13;
rediscovery and initial application in this area by StoneX      However, the&#13;
method has a number of related antecedents. The earliest in the input-output&#13;
field is perhaps that due to Leontief 2/ while an exhaustive discussion of the&#13;
method and its origins has been provided by Bacharach 3/&#13;
1/ Cambridge, D.A.E., A Programme for Growth, Volume 3, 'Input-Output&#13;
Relationships, 1954-1966', Chapman &amp; Hall, 1962.&#13;
2/ Leontief (1941).&#13;
3/ Bacharach (1970).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 288 -&#13;
The matrix B defined in equation (A.2) is derived from A by pre-&#13;
and post-multiplication of A by diagonal matrices. This implies that the&#13;
i,jth element of B is obtained from the i,jth element of A as&#13;
(A.3)    bij =   ri aij si&#13;
where ri is the i th element of the vector r , that is, it is the i th&#13;
diagonal element of r ; and sj is similarly the j th element of the&#13;
vector s which provides the non-zero elements of the matrix s .&#13;
Since equation (A.3) holds for all elements of the matrices A and&#13;
B , it follows that these matrices are of the same size. It also follows that&#13;
the number of elements in r must equal the number of rows in A (and B ),&#13;
while the number of columns in A (and B ) determines the number of elements&#13;
in s . More specifically, each row has a corresponding element in r and&#13;
the b 's are formed by first multiplying every element in the i th row&#13;
ij&#13;
of A by the same factor ri . Accordingly, the ri's are referred to as&#13;
row effects. Carrying through these row operations for all elements of A&#13;
produces a new matrix C given by&#13;
(A.4)    C  =  r A&#13;
where the  i,j th element of   C  is given by&#13;
(A.5)    cij  =  ri aij&#13;
The next and final step in deriving B is to multiply every element in the&#13;
j th  column of  C  by the  j th  element of   s , i.e., by     . The elements&#13;
of s are known accordingly as column effects. Introducing these effects for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 289 -&#13;
all elements of C generates a new matrix C s which, from (A.4) and (A.2),&#13;
is the matrix B i.e.&#13;
(A.6)    C s  =  r A s      B&#13;
where&#13;
(A.7)    bij  =  cii Si      ri aij  ;&#13;
From the symmetry of the problem it follows that in deriving B&#13;
there is no need to consider row and column effects in any particular order:&#13;
the two types of effect are of equal significance and ordering is arbitrary.&#13;
Simply, the method is to obtain each   bij  by multiplying the corresponding&#13;
element of  aij   by a row effect,  ri , and a column effect,   sj . One&#13;
consequence which is worth noting is that if a particular    aij  is zero, then&#13;
the corresponding element of   bij  will also be zero.&#13;
This discussion so far explains how matrix    B  is obtained from  A&#13;
given the vectors of row and column effects, r and a . It does not explain&#13;
how  r  and   s  are determined.  For this we need to go back to the initial&#13;
statement that the object of the exercise is to obtain a matrix    B  which&#13;
satisfies the conditions of equation (A.1), that is, which has the desired row&#13;
and column totals given by x and y . From equation (A.2) it follows that&#13;
if the RAS method is to produce a B matrix with the desired properties, then&#13;
we must have&#13;
(A.8)    x  -  Bi      r A s i  =  r A s&#13;
and&#13;
(A.9)    y'  -  i'B      i' r A s  -  r' A s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 290 -&#13;
Thus for given  A , x   and  y , the RAS method produces a modified version&#13;
of A with the desired properties provided that we can find vectors r and&#13;
s such that&#13;
(A.10)   x  =  r A s   and    y'  =  r' A s&#13;
The usual algorithm for finding vectors   r and   s which satisfy the&#13;
conditions (A.10) is to generate a series of matrices   A1 , A2 , A3 ,   ..&#13;
ad infinitum which converges to the matrix B . The procedure can start&#13;
either with rows or with columns. We can assume we start with rows. In this&#13;
case A1 is formed from A by scaling the elements in a particular row of&#13;
A so that their sum is equal to the corresponding element of x ; and&#13;
performing such scaling for each row of A so that A1 has row sums equal&#13;
to x . The vector of row scaling factors can be denoted r, . Having&#13;
obtained A1 and r, , it can be noted that column sums of A1 will not&#13;
necessarily be equal to the corresponding elements of y' . Hence the columns&#13;
of A1 can now be scaled so that they are equal to y' . Doing so produces a&#13;
new matrix  A2   from  A1 , together with a vector of column scaling factors&#13;
which can be denoted   a1 . But now this column scaling of    A1  will typically&#13;
imply that row sums of A2 are not equal to x . Hence A2 needs to be&#13;
scaled by rows to bring row sums into equality with x once more. This&#13;
results in a new matrix A3 and a second vector of row scalars, r2 . And&#13;
now the column balance will have been disturbed. So rescaling by columns is&#13;
necessary, leading to A4 and 82 . Which in turn leads to a need to rescale&#13;
yet again by rows, and so on ad infinitum in a sequence of scaling operations&#13;
which alternates between rows and columns and is given by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(A. 11)  x      r 1 A i     r2 A2 i     r3 A4 i &#13;
(A.12)   y'    I' A        i, A3 82    i  A5 s3&#13;
where&#13;
A       rIA                    A2     A1 s1&#13;
(A.13)   A3       2  2                    4      3  2&#13;
A5      r3 A4                  A6     A5 S3&#13;
This sequence of operations will not always converge and the&#13;
literature discusses the exceptional cases S1     Normally, however, for the type&#13;
of problems encountered in the present study, convergence is quite rapid. The&#13;
matrix AN which is ultimately obtained (as a function of the level of&#13;
accuracy required) is such that if&#13;
(A.1)            1  2  3        N+1&#13;
2&#13;
and&#13;
(A1)     a      81 6283        SN+1&#13;

then,&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 292 -&#13;
(A.17)   x  =   rA s     and    y'   * r' A s&#13;
or&#13;
(A.18)   x      r A s    and    y'   =  r' A s&#13;
In other words, vectors r and s are determined by equations (A.14) and&#13;
(A.15) which approximately satisfy the requirements for such vectors as given&#13;
in (A.10). Hence the required vectors of row and column effects are&#13;
determined.&#13;
A final point to note is that if vectors r and s satisfy the&#13;
conditions (A.10) then so will vectors Ar and (1/A)s where A is any&#13;
number (positive or negative), apart from zero. This follows from the fact&#13;
that&#13;
(A.19)   (A ri) aij (s1/A)    - ri aii 8i&#13;
and implies that r and s vectors can never be uniquely determined. The&#13;
scale on which the r vector is measured implies a scaling for the s&#13;
vector, and vice versa.   Thus products   ri si are uniquely fixed.    But the&#13;
choice of scale for either   r   or  s  is arbitrary../&#13;
1/ Mathematically, this result can be traced back to the fact that the&#13;
desired vectors of row and column sums, x and y , must always satisfy&#13;
i'x = y'i , i.e. that the sum of row sums for the new matrix B must be&#13;
equal to the sum of column sums.&#13;

            Improving the macroeconomic data base : a
            SAM for Malaysia, 1970
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The SAM for Malaysia addresses a number
            of conceptual issues and their practical solution which do
            not seem to have been treated elsewhere. This SAM is a large
            one, with a level of detail more nearly that at which
            national accounts are typically compiled, rather than the
            more aggregated formats which are often adopted as a basis
            for macro models or analysis. Malaysia's excellent set
            of national accounts make possible an initial exploration of
            the strengths and weaknesses of using market prices as the
            basis for evaluation of commodity balances, leading to some
            formal, algebraic treatment of the reasons for preferring
            this approach to other conventions. An extensive household
            survey, covering incomes, expenditures, and employment
            issues, complements the national accounts in defining the
            principle data sources. The major novelties of this SAM
            include: (i) it has been necessary to define a two-region
            SAM at the conceptual level; (ii) given the conceptual
            framework, the approach is essentially to estimate a SAM for
            East Malaysia and then to form the SAM for all Malaysia by
            combining this with a matched matrix for the West Malaysia
            states. These novelties should be of interest to others
            concerned with SAM estimation methods.
