Ahmedabad Slum Electrification Program&#13;

Electrifying Change&#13;
&#13;
Municipal authorities in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's largest city, had initiated a trust- and confidence-building&#13;
exercise with people in informal settlements and slums to address the menace of illegal electricity connections.&#13;
The effort, involving a local non-governmental organization, has helped convert a large number of unsafe and&#13;
illegal connections into safe ones and reduce the losses incurred by the utility. Enthused by the success of the&#13;
pilot, the Ahmedabad Electricity Corporation scaled-up the initiative and more than 200,000 slum households&#13;
now have legal connections. The initiative has been integrated into a larger development program for slums and&#13;
informal settlements, called Parivartan (Change).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Given the scale of the challenge, a slum electrification program that&#13;
would extend safe, reliable, and legal electricity connections to the informal&#13;
settlements in the city in a collaborative approach was taken up.&#13;

Alandur Municipality in Tamil Nadu is improving sanitation services to slum dwellers through an inclusive&#13;
approach that benefits all segments of the township. The effort demonstrates how services can be improved&#13;
where there is strong political commitment coupled with effective communications, transparency, and&#13;
partnership with community-based organizations. Nearly 8,350 of the 23,000 households that paid&#13;

Bangalore Water Service Delivery&#13;
&#13;
Indigenous Model Shows the Way&#13;
&#13;
From 2000 to 2005, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) experimented with service&#13;
delivery in slums, first through three pilot projects under a donor-funded program, and then through a newly-&#13;
created Social Development Unit (SDU). By early 2005, the SDU had mobilized 46 communities, approximately&#13;
10 percent of the city's slums, of which more than half have successfully connected to the BWSSB network&#13;
and continue to be served with water, receive bills, and make payments. The program has had significant&#13;
impact despite many hurdles; it has provided an important indigenous model, and is slowly but surely&#13;
being scaled-up.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  Since the completion of the Package Program in late 2004, almost all&#13;
  of the 46 slums now have water lines, although many of these lines are&#13;
  not being serviced regularly.&#13;

A novel initiative that gives slum dwellers and non-governmental organizations a role in the design,&#13;
implementation, and care of basic urban sanitation facilities is under way in Greater Mumbai's densely-&#13;
populated slum areas. The initiative is already showing signs of success and sustainability. What is more, it is&#13;
engendering development beyond basic sanitation in hygiene. Here are some highlights from the case study.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
Partnering for Power&#13;
&#13;
A public-private partnership initiative to rationalize the distribution of power in Delhi has proved to be a success.&#13;
From a situation where losses were humongous and power thefts were a norm, the privatization of power&#13;
distribution has helped turn the situation around, especially in the city's slum and informal settlements.&#13;
Approximately 11,000 slum cluster customers have been connected so far; 70 to 80 percent of these&#13;
customers pay bills. The New Delhi Power Limited (NDPL), a joint venture between Tata Power and the Delhi&#13;
Government to distribute power in the northern areas of Delhi, has already reached its five-year goal of reducing&#13;
its losses from 51 percent to 31 percent in three years.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Customers already connected can, apart from the possibility of sending&#13;
e-mails and letters, make complaints and receive other services through a&#13;
24-hour call center, a commercial call center, and a consumer care center.&#13;

The Challenge&#13;
&#13;
Till 2002, in the pre-New Delhi Power&#13;
Limited (NDPL) scenario, the power&#13;
distribution and management in Delhi&#13;
was in a shambles, having to cope with&#13;
a burgeoning population of 14 million&#13;
plus, a sixth part of which lived in slums&#13;
and informal settlements.&#13;
&#13;
At the time when the NDPL took over&#13;
the management, losses from electricity&#13;
distribution had touched nearly 51&#13;
percent. This was apparently due to&#13;
illegal connections in the network.&#13;
Slum areas were being provided&#13;
with electricity through a Single Point&#13;
Delivery (SPD) contractor model. In the&#13;
pre-NDPL scenario, many customers&#13;
were not satisfied with the service and       connect legally to the network,           metered. The responsibility of reading&#13;
claimed they were not billed properly.        and partly by other means, such as        the individual meters, billing the&#13;

                                              strategy to reach its objective. In the&#13;
transfer areas with SPD contractors                                                     per agreement.&#13;

            Utility and city managers, civil society
            organizations, and communities should be given the skills,
            confidence, and capacity to bring about effective change.
            There are many examples in India of agencies that have
            demonstrated imagination, resourcefulness, and commitment in
            their approach to serving the poor, with excellent results
            both for the people and the service provider. Some good
            practices from water and sanitation utilities and other
            sectors such as electricity are summarized in these notes.
