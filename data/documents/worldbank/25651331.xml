The Gini coefficient in Indonesia has increased sharply&#13;
over the past l5 years, increasing from 30 in 2000 to&#13;
41 in 2013. In a   2014 survey on public perceptions of&#13;
inequality, most Indonesians consider income distribution&#13;
in Indonesia to be "very unequal" or "not equal at all." In&#13;
addition, half of all respondents feel that Indonesia has&#13;
become "more unequal" or "much more unequal" over&#13;
the past five years.&#13;

population earn as much as the bottom 40 percent. Not&#13;
with standing this ideal, respondents estimate that the&#13;
actual income distribution has the top 20 percent earning&#13;
as much as the bottom 60 percent. However, the 2014&#13;
National Socio-economic Survey (Susenas 2014) suggests&#13;
that the richest 20 percent actually earn as much as the&#13;
rest of the population combined. Furthermore, because&#13;
household surveys typically do not capture the incomes&#13;
of the richest Indonesians, the real level of inequality in&#13;
4 i i      h                                  Indonesia is probably even higher.&#13;

respondents support social protection programs as a key&#13;
policy measure.&#13;
While 57 percent of respondents&#13;
believe that external factors play a significant part in&#13;
poverty, 52 percent of respondents believe that it is&#13;
easy for people to pull themselves out of poverty if they&#13;
work hard enough, with another 41 percent saying that&#13;

respondents consider job creation policies a top priority,&#13;
while complementary policies such as credits for small-&#13;

the quality of education are also supported.&#13;

WHY DO PUBLIC&#13;
PERCEPTIONS&#13;
OF INEQUALITY&#13;
Although inequality has risen in Indonesia over the past decade, public concern towards&#13;
the issue of inequality has been low historically. But with the current government setting&#13;
targets to reduce inequality, and the media and politicians paying more attention to&#13;
the issue, public perceptions may be shifting. This study examines public perceptions&#13;
towards inequality using recent data to help us understand how the public perceives&#13;
the issue and if there is general support for a public policy response.&#13;

THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF INEQUALITY, HOWEVER, IS&#13;
FAR HIGHER THAN MOST RESPONDENTS BELIEVE.&#13;
Survey respondents were asked to estimate Indonesia's  Income inequality in Indonesia is hiqher&#13;
income distribution.9 Their average estimate had    than peoplethink(fig.4)&#13;
the richest quintile (i.e., the wealthiest 20 percent of&#13;
people) earning 38 percent of all income, roughly equal&#13;
to what respondents believe the bottom 60 percent&#13;
earns (Figure 4). Although this distribution is perceived as&#13;
being highly unequal, it is equivalent to a Gini coefficient&#13;
of 30, which is a relatively low Gini compared with other&#13;
countries in the region. It is also equal to the lowest Gini&#13;
coefficient Indonesia has had since the Asian financial&#13;
crisis in 1997-1998. But despite these perceptions, the&#13;
reality is that Indonesia's inequality is far higher. As of&#13;
2014, Indonesia had a Gini coefficient of 41-as measured&#13;
by the national socio-economic survey (Survei Sosial&#13;
Ekonomi Nasional, or Susenas)-with the richest 20&#13;
percent accounting for half of Indonesia's consumption10&#13;
HALF OF THE RESPONDENTS ALSO FEEL THAT&#13;
INEQUALITY HAS BEEN GETTING WORSE&#13;
RECENTLY. Between 2009 and 2014, the Gini coefficient--&#13;
in Indonesia increased from 37 to 41. A slim majority of&#13;
respondents (51 percent) agrees that income distribution&#13;
in Indonesia has become "more unequal" or "much more  PECIE      ITIUIN          SSNSDSRBTO&#13;

in Susenas only asks about household consumption, not income. In fact, income inequality is always higher than consumption&#13;
inequality because richer households do not spend all of their income, hut save some instead. Previous estimates put Indonesia's&#13;
income Gini 6.4 points higher than its consumption Gini (World Bank, 2015). So, a consumption Gini of41 implies an income Gini&#13;
of around 47. Moreover, it is believed that many richer households are not measured by Susenas, suggesting that actual inequality&#13;
may be even higher. Current World Bank research is using credit data to estimate a more accurate number of wealthier Indonesians&#13;
(World Bank; forthcoming).&#13;

PEOPLE THINK IS&#13;
Most respondents believe that poverty is caused by one's circumstances at birth. But the&#13;
survey also emphasizes the strong belief in hard work: almost half of respondents believe&#13;
that people become rich through hard work and one third thinks that it is possible for the&#13;
poor to escape poverty through hard work.&#13;
RESPONDENTS DO NOT THINK THAT THE                  World Bank findings that Indonesia's rising inequality is&#13;

WHICH INEQUALITY-&#13;
REDUCING&#13;
Overall, Indonesians believe that inequality reduction is an urgent priority. Consistent&#13;
with beliefs on the drivers of inequality, policy support is strongest for: programs that&#13;
provide assistance to households that are poor or vulnerable to poverty and protect them&#13;
from shocks; policies and programs that provide better work opportunities; and efforts to&#13;
eradicate corruption.&#13;
MOST INDONESIANS ARE CONCERNED WITH               FOR REDUCED INEQUALITY. People often perceive&#13;
REDUCING INEQUALITY AND BELIEVE IT SHOULD         that there is a trade-off between policies that promote&#13;
BE AN URGENT PRIORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT.          growth and those that promote equity. However, recent&#13;
When asked about whether it is urgent for the Government research by Dabla-Norris, et al. (2015) suggests that&#13;
to reduce inequality, 88 percent of respondents consider  redistributing income to the poorest groups can actually&#13;
it either "urgent" or "very urgent" (Figure 11). This attitude  accelerate economic growth. When confronted with this&#13;
towards inequality suggests that inequality reduction is  hypothetical trade-off and asked to choose between&#13;
one of the key lenses through which the public assesses  "incomes of poor people grow quickly, but inequality&#13;
government policy.                               is high" and "incomes of poor people grow slowly, but&#13;
inequality is low," 61 percent of respondents choose the&#13;
IN ADDITION, A MAJORITY OF INDONESIANS IS        latter scenario. Thus, although a significant number of&#13;
ALSO WILLING TO ACCEPT THE TRADE-OFF OF           people choose to prioritize rapid income growth, the&#13;

of these findings is that such policies may receive greater  month after the formation of the cabinet in November&#13;
public support if they are linked to social protection  2014, followed by a change from a fixed price system to&#13;
programs or funding, and create opportunities for hard  a fixed subsidy system shortly afterwards. This caused&#13;
work. For example, if the Village Law is designed and  a wave of protests and a significant amount of media&#13;
socialized as a policy to improve the performance of  coverage. However, findings from this survey suggest&#13;
spending on health, education, and social protection  that overall support for increasing subsidies-which also&#13;
programs, or as a way to create more and better jobs, this  includes agriculture subsidies-is low (Figure 14).&#13;
may resonate more with the general public. In addition,&#13;
support for the Village Law will dwindle if it is perceived&#13;
as an additional opportunity for local leaders to engage in&#13;
corruption. Communication strategies about infrastructure&#13;
projects should focus less on the benefits for growth, and  supported by those likely to benefit&#13;
more on how the projects can improve the quality and&#13;
quantity of jobs and reduce the prices of food and other  from them&#13;

Finally, although increasing taxes on the rich receive  Public SUPP rw                   (fig3)&#13;

INTRODUCTION: Assalamu'alaikum, good morning/day/afternoon. We are conducting research on social problems in this area. We&#13;
study the views of INDONESIAN CITIZENS about how this country is managed. Every citizen in Indonesia - who is 17 years old, or older&#13;
or already married - has the same opportunity to participate in this study. All information will be kept confidential and used for research&#13;
purposes only. Your participation in the survey is voluntary. Your help is highly appreciated.&#13;
For interviewer&#13;
Definition ofhousehold and income&#13;
HOUSEHOLD is a group of people who usually live together under the same roof and eat from the same kitchen.&#13;
* One household may consist of only one member of the household.&#13;
* HOUSEHOLD members are all the people who USUALLY LIVE AND EAT IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD, whether adults, children,&#13;
infants, or those who are travelling (less than 6 months) but do not intend to move, or anyone else who may not be members of the family but&#13;
ordinarily stay in this household, such as house maids or people who temporarily stay or friends.&#13;
INCOME OF A HOUSEHOLD is money earned by the household members which increases the total household income.&#13;
A housemaid who lives in a household, for example, is not considered earning income. For farmers producing crops for their own household needs,&#13;
the income CAN BE ESTIMATED from the agricultural products consumed when assessed with money.&#13;

Interviewer Guidelines&#13;
*   Understand each question well before asking&#13;
*   Make sure respondents understand questions properly.&#13;
Now I will ask about the people of Indonesia. Suppose the Indonesian population is divided into five community groups. Each group has&#13;
the same number of population, i.e., each has equally one-fifth of the total population. If the Indonesian population is&#13;
now 250 million people, then each group equally consists of 50 million people. However, the group has five different incomes.&#13;
The five community groups are depicted with staircases like this (SHOW STAIRCASE IMAGE):&#13;
1. The top of the stairs is one fifth of the population whose income is the highest, or the richest group&#13;
2. The second step from the top is one fifth of the population whose income is much, or the rich group&#13;
3. The third stair from the top is one fifth of the population whose income is moderate, or the middle group&#13;
4. The fourth stair from the top is one fifth of the population whose income is less, or the poor group&#13;
5.The bottom of the stairs is one fifth of the population whose income is very little, or the poorest group.&#13;
Interviewer Guidelines&#13;
*   Ask if respondent has understood the explanation of the staircase image.&#13;
If not, please explain once again from the beginning.&#13;
*   If respondent has understood, then please show 50 pieces of coins in 500 (five hundred) rupiah denomina-&#13;
tions. No need to mention the number of coins shown, unless respondent asks.&#13;
Here are some coins. Suppose the whole coins are the entire income oflndonesia.&#13;
In your opinion, how much income of each community group in&#13;
Indonesia IN FACT today?&#13;
To answer this question, try to divide the coins into the five steps.&#13;
You do not need to worry that you have a wrong answer. It is your estimation only. Please just be reminded, that the number of coins for the lower&#13;
step should not be more than the higher step, because the higher step is the richer group.&#13;
For example only, if you consider the whole income NOW IN FACT belongs to the highest income or the richest group only, put all coins on the&#13;
top step. If you assume that NOW IN FACT all groups have the same income, put all the coins equally on each of the steps.&#13;

Interviewer Guidelines&#13;
*   Remind respondent, that the number of coins placed on a lower step should not be more than the higher&#13;
step, but the amount could be equal.&#13;
*   Interviewer needs to assure respondent's answer. For example, by asking, is it true that you give this much&#13;

11. SHOW ONCE AGAIN THE STAIRCASE IMAGE DROP CARD, AND COINS.&#13;
Interviewer Guidelines&#13;
*   Interviewer should remove all coins from the staircase image drop card before start asking questions.&#13;
*   Read out questions clearly and do not speak too fast.&#13;
*   Make sure respondent understands questions properly.&#13;
Now let's look back the Staircase Image. And suppose that the whole ofthe coins is the entire income oflndonesia.&#13;
In your opinion, what SHOULD BE the income of each&#13;
community group in Indonesia?&#13;
To answer this question, try to divide back the coins in to the five steps.&#13;
You do not need to worry that you have a wrong answer. It is according to your consideration only. Please just be reminded, that the number of&#13;
coins for the lower step should not be more than the higher step, because the higher step is the richer group.&#13;
For example only, if in your opinion the whole income SHOULD belong to the highest income group or the richest group only, then put all the coins&#13;
on the top step. Or if you consider that all groups SHOULD have the same income, put all the coins equally on each of the steps.&#13;

Education Groups&#13;
Education groups were constructed based on the response to survey question V_6.Due to the small sizes of "in-between" groups, i.e. respondents&#13;
that started the next level of education but did not complete them, the analysis groups those groups downwards, e.g. "did not complete SMP" is&#13;
included in "Completed SD", etc. The final five groups used are:&#13;
1. No education completed               4. Completed SMA (senior high school)&#13;
2. Completed SD (primary school)        5. Completed tertiary education&#13;
3. Completed SMP (junior high school)&#13;
Responses to survey question:                                Clustered responses:&#13;
Complete S1 or over                                       Completed tertiary&#13;

Income groups&#13;
Household income approximations were constructed based on responses to questions V_62 to V_70 (see Annex A), which capture up to five main&#13;
income sources for the household. The questions were structured as follows:&#13;
1. Below 200 thousand                   7.1.2-1.399 million&#13;
2. 200-399 thousand                     8.1.4-1.599 million&#13;
3. 400-599 thousand                     9.1.6-1.799 million&#13;
4. 600-799 thousand                     10. 1.8-1.999 million&#13;
5. 800-999 thousand                     11. 2 million - 4 million&#13;
6. 1 million -1.199 million             12. Above 4 million&#13;
The total household monthly income is obtained by using the maximum of the answer range (199 thousand, 399 thousand, 599 thousand, etc.)&#13;
and summing up all five income sources. This number is then divided by the reported number of household members, resulting in a per capita&#13;
household monthly income.&#13;
The per capita household monthly income is then compared to the three different dividers: the poverty line, 1.5 times the poverty line, and 3.5 times&#13;
the poverty line. This results in four income class groups: the Poor (below the poverty line), the Vulnerable (between the poverty line and 1.5 times&#13;
the poverty line), the Emerging Consumer Class (between 1.5 and 3.5 times the poverty line), and the Consumer Class (above 3.5 times the poverty&#13;
line). This methodology is discussed further in The World Bank's Report on the Indonesian Middle Class. The poverty lines used are based on the&#13;
September 2013 National Socio-Economic Survey (Survei Sosio-Ekonomi National, Susenas), and are different for urban and rural respondents in&#13;
each province.&#13;

            has increased sharply over the past 15 years, increasing
            from 30 in 2000 to 41 in 2013. In a 2014 survey on public
            perceptions of inequality, most Indonesians consider income
            distribution in Indonesia to be "very unequal" or
            "not equal at all." In addition, half of all
            respondents feel that Indonesia has become "more
            unequal" or "much more unequal" over the past
            five years. The true extent of high inequality, however, is
            worse than most people realize. Respondents believe that the
            ideal income distribution is one where the top 20 percent of
            the population earn as much as the bottom 40 percent. Not
            with standing this ideal, respondents estimate that the
            actual income distribution has the top 20 percent earning as
            much as the bottom 60 percent. However, the 2014 National
            Socio-economic Survey (Susenas 2014) suggests that the
            richest 20 percent actually earn as much as the rest of the
            population combined. Furthermore, because household surveys
            typically do not capture the incomes of the richest
            Indonesians, the real level of inequality in Indonesia is
            probably even higher.
