RecentDevelopmentsinthe AfghanEconomy&#13;
&#13;
 1.     Afghanistanhas achieved respectable economic growth duringthe past four years,&#13;
with the real value of non-opium Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increasing by 29&#13;
percent in 2002/03, 16 percent in 2003/04, 8 percent in 2004/05, a drought year, and 14&#13;
percent in 2005/06. The Governmento f Afghanistan (GOA) has also maintained a stable&#13;
macroeconomic framework as evidenced by the successful completion o f all quarterly&#13;
reviews under the IMF Staff-Monitored Program (SMP, from March 2004 to March&#13;
2006) and the first review of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)&#13;
program. Monetary policy has been restrained, supported by the adherence to strong&#13;
fiscal discipline and a "no overdraft" rule that prohibits Central Bank from financing a&#13;
deficit. Inflation i s decelerating and year-on-year inflation declined to 5.2 percent in&#13;
September 2006 (compared to 16percent in2004/05).&#13;
&#13;
2.      Duringthis period, public spendingmanagedthrough the budget process has been&#13;
the government's main tool to implement its development strategy and coordinate donor&#13;
assistance. In 2004, the government introduced the concept o f a core budget (all funds&#13;
flowing through government accounts subject to its Public Financial Management [PFM]&#13;
regime) and an external budget (external assistance directly executed by donors;&#13;
essentially ex-PFM) that accounts for almost two thirds of all spending. The core budget&#13;
consists o f an operating budget ("ordinary budget" covering current expenditure and&#13;
some small capital expenditure) and a development budget (reconstruction projects and&#13;
some recurrent costs). The total core budget expenditure increased between 2004/05 and&#13;
2005/06 by 30 percent to US$l.1 billion. Within the core budget, operating expenditures&#13;
amounted in 2005/06 to US$651 million, 63 percent of which consisted o f wages and&#13;
salaries.  Core development expenditures reached US$424 million, increasing by 58&#13;
percent from 2004/05, reaching almost six percent of GDP, a commendable level by&#13;
international standards. This development strategy has created a high demand for&#13;
maintaining credible, transparent and effective PFM performance, principally through the&#13;
Ministryo fFinance (MOF).&#13;
&#13;
3.      While the external budget is financed exclusively from donor grants, the core&#13;
budget i s financed from four sources: (i)   domestic revenues, which reached US$415&#13;
million in 2005/06 (5.7 percent o f GDP); (ii)donor grants, including the Afghanistan&#13;
Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) and proceeds o f the International Development&#13;
Association (IDA) budget support (US$724 million or 9.9 percent of GDP); (iii)  external&#13;
loans, including the proceeds o f the Programmatic Support for Institutional Building I&#13;
(PSIB I)(US$107 million or 1.5 percent o f GDP); and (iv) changes in currency deposits&#13;
at Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), Afghanistan's central bank. To date, the GOA has been&#13;
able to maintain donor confidence and participation by operating within an agreed&#13;
Medium Term Financing Framework (MTFF) that has accompanied its medium term&#13;
development and poverty reduction agenda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.            Continuing to use the budget process as the main instrument for promoting&#13;
developmentandpoverty reduction, the GOA and donors have agreed on a revised MTFF&#13;
(Table 1.1), based on the recently concluded Interim-Afghanistan National Development&#13;
Strategy (I-ANDs)and "Compact" to end 2009-10. Meeting Compact objectives requires&#13;
substantial increase in spending from US$1.1 billion in 2005/06 to US$1.6 billion in&#13;
2006/07 and US$2.6 billion by 2009/10. In addition to making needed investments in&#13;
development projects, key increases in operating expenditures are likely to be driven by:&#13;
(i) implementationofanewpayandgradingpolicy; (ii) recruitmentofaround&#13;
     the                                                                                      the&#13;
 10,000 teachers per year; (iii) increase in non-wage expenditures to cover levels for&#13;
                                              an&#13;
operating and maintaining new investments and to accommodate costs transferred from&#13;
the external budget previously financed by donors outside the budget process; and (iv)&#13;
significant increases inthe security sector.&#13;

5.           GOA is expected to make a major improvement in generating domestic revenue&#13;
over the Compact period, and has secured technical assistance to strengthen tax and&#13;
customs performance. Nonetheless, there are significant risks and uncertainties about the&#13;
outcome of this effort. As a result, donors' assistance will remain crucial as a source o f&#13;
stable and predictable financing for Afghanistan's budget inthe coming years. Building&#13;
on pledges made at the London Conference, external assistance to the budget is expected&#13;
to increase from US$l.O billion in2006/07 to US$l.6 billion in 2009/10. The ARTF and&#13;
the Law and Order Trust Fundfor Afghanistan are expected to remain key vehicles for&#13;
this assistance. Inaddition, Afghanistan has adopted a prudentexternal debt strategy and&#13;
i s expected to borrow only at concessional terms. It i s also expected to become eligible&#13;
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, combined with the Multilateral&#13;
Debt Relief Initiative and bilateral commitment to debt cancellation, should lead to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                 7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
significant debt relief in the coming years. All o f these initiatives and options remain&#13;
feasible, however, ifthe international community maintains confident that PFM functions&#13;
are performed following acceptable international norms for transparency and&#13;
accountability.     It also would require that a larger percentage of the annual budget&#13;
provisions (currently at about 37%) be used inthe year for which they are allocated as an&#13;
indication o f growing efficiency inthe use o f public monies.&#13;
&#13;
AchievementsinPFM&#13;
&#13;
6.       Since 2002 the GOA has made progress in establishing a functioning public&#13;
financial management system under the direction o f the MOF.                  The World Bank&#13;
assessment o f Afghanistan's public financial management and procurement performance'&#13;
conducted under the auspices o f the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability&#13;
(PEFA) program (November 27, 2005), concluded that while there are weaknesses that&#13;
threaten longer term sustainability o f the M O F performance and "exacerbate the&#13;
disconnect between public expectations and the actual delivery o f services, the strong&#13;
achievements interms o f fiscal discipline, cash control, and aggregate transparency have&#13;
contributedto macroeconomic stability, as well as to sustained external assistance."&#13;
&#13;
7.       The MOF is producing annual budgetsthat meet basic requirements of the GOA-&#13;
IMF-Donor approved MTFF, even though the timeliness o f preparingthese budgets and&#13;
the system for monitoring budget execution and assuring their development effectiveness&#13;
continues to require improvement. The system i s also performing adequately against each&#13;
o f the six basic sets o f criteria used to evaluate performance in the PEFA2 partnership&#13;
program. MOF's overall performance has also been recently reconfirmed in the Mid&#13;
Term Review o f the Public Administration Capacity Building (PACB) project that has&#13;
provided financial support for the MOF treasury, procurement, and audit functions.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Importantly, the basic legal framework underlying the PFM and procurement&#13;
systems has also been established including new procurement and financial management&#13;
basic laws, establishment o f basic systems and protocols for procurement and financial&#13;
operations, and reporting and performance auditing. Recruitment and training o f Afghan&#13;
staff inprocurement has begun. Additional analysis has been completed that provides the&#13;
basis for upgrading the Afghanistan Financial Management Information System(AFMIS)&#13;
and training o f staff inbasic accounting and auditing has occurred.&#13;
&#13;
9.       However, these achievements have been obtained with a high degree o f direct&#13;
donor assistance through the ARTF Administrator's Office and the Afghanistan National&#13;
Development Agency and with the use o f costly operations contracts with international&#13;
firms, including the hiring o f qualified Afghans as national contractors. In addition, the&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
integrity o f the system has depended on having PFM operations centralized in the MOF&#13;
with little direct management role assigned to line ministries, provincial offices, or state&#13;
owned enterprises. Moreover this control i s being managed on a "transactions" basis,&#13;
and with significant levels o f ex ante clearances. Currently, as many as 70 long term&#13;
international and 200 national contactors assure that MOF performs its basic budgeting,&#13;
treasury, audit and procurement functions adequately. Not surprisingly, the areas o f&#13;
performance under the PEFA assessment with the highest ratings were those in which&#13;
contractors played the most dominant role.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Donors have been willing to support such heavy direct management and&#13;
supervision as part o f addressing the emergency situation facing the country. However,&#13;
this is not a sustainable situation and reforms should now be pursued to raise the level of&#13;
responsibility and accountability for PFM within the "mainstream" MOF. The ANDs&#13;
and Compact negotiated betweenthe GOA and the donor community has identified both&#13;
improving the performance o f financial management services and capacity building to&#13;
permit these services to be mainstreamed into the MOF and line ministries as part of their&#13;
core operations. With this improved performance, the donor community would be able to&#13;
meet several o f its own wishes to improve the effectiveness o f aid for Afghanistan:&#13;
improving the timeliness and predictability in providing necessary resources, increased&#13;
use o f the core budget to receive and manage assistance (decreasing the reliance on the&#13;
"external budget") and improve transparency on usingthe external budget when used.&#13;
&#13;
ContinuingChallenges,IssuesandConstraints&#13;
&#13;
11.     To achieve its developmental goals, GOA and the donor community have agreed&#13;
on a MTFF to 2010 that i s ambitious and sensitive to risks. Overall spending through the&#13;
core budget i s projected to rise by 63% compared to the plan for 2007 (Table 1.1). O f&#13;
this, "ordinary spending" for personnel, operating costs and small investments would&#13;
grow by 33%. This will increase the number o f small, repetitive transactions, involving&#13;
numerous agencies (the top 10 line ministries3excluding defense and interior, account for&#13;
only about 46% o f this spending) and place increased demands on regular cash&#13;
management, accounting, auditing, and the performance o f these functions by line&#13;
ministries. The MTFF also calls for an increase of about 100% in the development&#13;
budget. Success in realizing this level o f investment spending depends heavily on the&#13;
GOA'S capability to execute tendering and contract management and to do so following&#13;
improved procurement management practices. Currently, only about 52% o f planned&#13;
expenditures are being realized. This spending i s concentrated in relatively few line&#13;
ministries; five line ministries4are expected to account for in excess o f 60% o f the total&#13;
and the top 10 account for virtually the entire development budget. Lastly, while GOA&#13;
expects to increase the level o f financing through customs and nationally generated taxes,&#13;
realistically the MTFF continues to require a 50% increase in external financing. The&#13;
willingness o f external sources to be forthcoming in a regular and predictable manner&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
will depend on maintaining transparency and good governance in public financial&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Inorder to strengthen the capability and sustainability o f the PFM system, MOF&#13;
and the Control and Audit Office (CAO) have recognized that it will have to address&#13;
several organizational and capacity constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0    Incomplete re-organization o f MOF. While all main departments within&#13;
              M O F have undergone restructuring under the Priority Reform and&#13;
              Restructuring (PRR) program, the MOF would still require restructuring&#13;
              o f its remaining functions to assure that all o f its departments work as an&#13;
              integrated whole. It i s also important that staffing plans in terms o f&#13;
              numbers, job descriptions, grade levels, and qualifications be finalized.&#13;
              This i s critical for making further staffing decisions, including revising&#13;
              grading and pay to adopt the GOA pay and grading policy, internalizing&#13;
              new rules governing the civil service; establishing the balance betweenthe&#13;
              use o f international and national contractors and civil servants to perform&#13;
              PFM functions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0    Concentration o f Responsibility. A high degree o f accountability in&#13;
              financial management decisions has been achieved by concentrating them&#13;
              inthe hands o f the ARTF, Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development&#13;
              Services (ARDS) and in MOF departments, in a closely monitored&#13;
              "transaction-based" system. However, this has also the effect o f lowering&#13;
              accountability for procurement and financial management decisions on the&#13;
              part of line ministries and agencies and actually increases the governance&#13;
              risk o f operations. There are limits to the expansion o f the internal&#13;
              capacity o f the M O F to further expand the transaction-based system and&#13;
              remain responsive, accountable and efficient. Line ministries and agencies&#13;
              should be involved in PFM to increase predictability and timeliness o f&#13;
              their operations, albeit, in parallel with their capacity to meet&#13;
              accountability standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0    Inadequate Human Resources Numbers, Capacity and Management.&#13;
              Engaging international firms and local consultants to perform basic&#13;
              treasury, budget, audit and procurement functions has been a default&#13;
              strategy, considering the inadequate technical capacity o f the civil service&#13;
              and inadequate incentives to the few who are qualified to remain in&#13;
              government service. Government external auditing in Afghanistan, for&#13;
              example, i s still dependent on external international advisors to perform&#13;
              financial statements audits and to conduct any other audits to acceptable&#13;
              standards. There i s no accounting profession inthe country and training in&#13;
              certification related programs i sjust becoming available and i s given only&#13;
              in English which as such is not accessible for most CAO staff. Several&#13;
              remedies, including off-site training, adequate grading and pay, effective&#13;
              recruiting and management o f careers o f civil servants for the longer term&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   (including pension management), and establishing schemes o f service for&#13;
   key professional classes are interlinked factors and require specialized&#13;
   management capacity that the MOF and most other ministries lack.&#13;
&#13;
   Anti-corruption and Maintaining Accountability and Transparency while&#13;
   Reforming. The control environment on which Afghanistan's PFM formal&#13;
   controls rest i s undermined by corruption in its various forms and&#13;
   manifestations. This i s increasingly seen as one o f the most important&#13;
   threats to Afghanistan's entire state-building and to delivering public&#13;
   services.   The GOA recognizes the critical importance o f addressing&#13;
   corruption and the MOF i s seeking advice on how to fight it. While a&#13;
   strategy is being developed and implemented, however, the current PFM&#13;
   operational functionality cannot be reduced while the effects o f PFM&#13;
   reforms are realized. Therefore, the M O F reform program would be&#13;
   compelled to maintain the high levels o f transparency and accountability,&#13;
   which are constraints on corruption, already attained with the current&#13;
   technical assistance. Moreover, the demands for transparency and&#13;
   accountability for the use o f public resources is growing in Afghanistan,&#13;
   first as anti-corruption sentiment i s growing and second as the legislature&#13;
   i s developing its role. Meeting these requirements would constrain the&#13;
   pace at which M O F could reduce its dependence on international&#13;
   supported staff and contracted services and de-concentrate o f PFM&#13;
   operations. The transformation process would require careful study and&#13;
   management including close monitoring and evaluation, and adjustment o f&#13;
  the reform program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 Maintaining Good Coordination and Momentum in Reform. Most experts&#13;
   see "reform" as an evolutionary process which requires time and the&#13;
   involvement o f all departments whose functions are interlinked.It i s also a&#13;
  process that affects individuals who should be engaged. With several&#13;
   sources o f assistance coming to the MOF, there i s a risk o f disconnects&#13;
  between the programs, agendas, timing and standards that may be adopted&#13;
  that would impair the smooth functioning the MOF as the GOA'Sapex&#13;
  public finance management organization. Moreover, staff may be subject&#13;
  to declining motivation and performance ("reform fatigue") as the process&#13;
  extends over time. Therefore a participatory and "change management"&#13;
  approach to improving performance would be preferred over a centralized&#13;
  "administered" change process. Both o f these initiatives require a vehicle&#13;
  for coordinating and planning change that will be sustained for a&#13;
  considerable period o f time.&#13;
&#13;

B. Government'sPublicFinancialManagementStrategy&#13;
&#13;
Overall Development Strategy&#13;
&#13;
 13.    InJanuary 2006, the government completed its I-ANDsand presented it together&#13;
with the Afghanistan Compact to the international community. This strategy builds on&#13;
earlier achievements, notably the National Development Framework (April 2002) and the&#13;
report "Securing Afghanistan's Future" (March 2004). The I-ANDs i s anchored in a&#13;
vision for Afghanistan "to consolidate peace and stability through just, democratic&#13;
processes and institutions, and to reduce poverty and achieve prosperity through broad&#13;
based and equitable economic growth."              These development objectives are consistent&#13;
with the Millennium Development Goals' national targets adopted by the Cabinet in&#13;
2005. The strategy i s structured around three pillars: (i)       security; (ii)governance, rule o f&#13;
law and human rights; and (iii)      economic and social development.&#13;
&#13;
 14.    The Afghanistan Compact commits the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan and the&#13;
international community to work toward a stable Afghanistanthrough good governance&#13;
and bases the Compact on a number o f principles that bear on PFM including: fiscal&#13;
sustainability, lasting Afghan capacity and effective state and civil society institutions,&#13;
combating corruption, and ensuring public transparency and accountability (Box 1.1).&#13;
&#13;
       Box 1.1: AfghanistanCompactBenchmarksfor FinancialManagement&#13;
By end-2007, the Government will ensure improvedtransparent financial management at the central and&#13;
provincial levels through establishing and meeting benchmarks for financial managementagreed with and&#13;
monitoredby the internationalcommunity, including those in the anticipated PRGF. In turn and in line&#13;
with improved government accountability, donors will make every effort to increase the share of total&#13;

15.     The government realizes that the reforms o f the PFM system that have already&#13;
begun will have to continue for it to meet the challenges o f the next years. As the&#13;
custodian o f the PFM, the MOF has prepared a Strategic Plan for the years 1384-89&#13;
(2006-2010) that proposes reforms that could produce both greater efficiency in&#13;
managing public resources (turnout) and maintaining the standards for oversight and&#13;
governance that have been achieved.&#13;
&#13;
16.     These reforms set goals and a short term work agenda for: (i)             mobilizing revenue&#13;
and managing government finances; (ii)           supporting economic management and growth;&#13;
(iii)managing "public wealth;" (iv) promotinggood governance; and(v) establishing&#13;
itself as a "best practice leader" in public sector reform. The action plan for the&#13;
immediate future covering 18 months seeks to correct some o f the more immediate&#13;
deficiencies in budget formulation and execution; procurement throughout the public&#13;
sector; financial controls, accounting, reporting, audit and public accountability; and&#13;
structural and administrative reform o f the MOF, provincial administrations and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financial management (FM) capabilities o f line ministries.Annual progress reviews were&#13;
expected to identify further actions for makingincremental improvements.&#13;
&#13;
17.      The strategy cites, among others, the risk of development in various departments&#13;
becoming misaligned and the need for good coordination between M O F and other&#13;
ministries and agencies as a basis for extending sound PFM practices. It calls for a&#13;
participatory process for strategic planning, regular support to MOF managers and&#13;
decision-makers to assure alignment o f actions, improved management o f technical&#13;
assistance, and regularized contact and communications with partner ministries and&#13;
agencies.&#13;
&#13;
18.      In 2005 the World Bank conducted a review of the PFM in Afghanistanusing a&#13;
performance measurement framework developed by the PEFA partnership program5&#13;
which identifies a set o f critical objectives o f a PFM system and a standard set o f high-&#13;
level PFM indicators to assess performance against those objectives.&#13;
&#13;
19.      The assessment considered as part o f the PFM arrangements the significant&#13;
external support (both advisory and operational) provided to the government in&#13;
procurement, treasury and audit as well as the work o f the ARTF's Monitoring Agent.&#13;
&#13;
20.      This assessment generally portrays a public sector where financial resources are,&#13;
by and large, being used for the intended purposes as authorized by a budget which is&#13;
processed with transparency and has contributed to aggregate fiscal discipline. The&#13;
expenditures and financial position are reported regularly in an understandable format.&#13;
However, performance regarding the allocation o f spending across programs and&#13;
agencies and the efficiency of operations i s not as good.&#13;
&#13;
21.       Since the assessment the government enacted the Public Finance and Expenditure&#13;
Management Law with robust reporting requirements on public finances and a&#13;
commitment to independent review by the Auditor General. This has been matched by&#13;
the government's full and timely publishingo f its monthly statement o fbudgetexecution&#13;
on the MOF web site. Similarly, all large procurement opportunities are widely published&#13;
andthe outcomes are also widely shared.&#13;
&#13;
22.      The study led to an outline o f a "Road Map for PFM reform" which coincides&#13;
with the MOF agenda which also calls for maintaining the reform effort as a managed&#13;
process through a special unit within the ministry.&#13;

&#13;
A. IDA'SRecentSupport for PFM&#13;
&#13;
23.      IDA has supported the establishment and functioning of a sound PFM system&#13;
since the launching of the Afghanistan InterimAdministration in 2002. It has done this&#13;
through two sets of complementary operations; through three operations providing PSIB&#13;
(Box 2.1) which have focused on making progress in establishing an enabling legal&#13;
framework for institutional development; and three investment operations; the&#13;
Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP, US$l0.0 million, GRTD-H0060); the&#13;
Second Emergency Public Administration Project (SEPAP, US$8.4 million, GRTD-H&#13;
0550); and the Public Administration Capacity Building project (PACB, US$27.0&#13;
million, GRTD-H 1440) (Table 2.1). Additionally, the Strengthening Financial&#13;
Management Capacity Project (TF052735-AF) funded through the ARTF also provided&#13;
supportto the PFMreforms.&#13;
&#13;
24.      The basic objective of these grants has beento assist the GOA to make good and&#13;
transparent use of public sector resources inthe post conflict environment. This has been&#13;
done by puttinginplace additional capacity to perform critical PFM operations, initiating&#13;
the process of developing indigenous capacity to perform these functions and beginning&#13;
the developmentofbroaderreforms inthe public administration.&#13;
&#13;
                               Box 2.1: Linkagewith PSIB Series&#13;
Institution-buildingis at the core of the objectives of the PSIBs and significant achievements have been&#13;
made under PSIB Iand 11, which are further advanced in the proposed PSIB 111. The program supports&#13;
improvements in the PFM legal framework; specifically civil service, procurement and financial&#13;
management laws were enacted. The program also supports improvements in budget management&#13;
processes and budget execution; all PSIB operations have supported the adoption of annual budgets,&#13;
anchoredin a macroeconomic framework; the program is also linkedto a tightening of fiduciary standards.&#13;
Beyond the change in the regulatory framework, the program supported reforms in payroll management,&#13;
procurement, and internal and external audit. Inparticular, for the first time, the government submittedto&#13;
Parliament its annual accountswith an external audit review, aprior action for PSIB111.&#13;
Another prior action for PSIB 111is the commitment to a PFM action plan by the government. The plan&#13;
follows the format of the roadmap which accompaniedthe Afghanistan PEFA review of 2005 and provides&#13;
steps to be taken inthe short andmediumterm. The steps in the following areas will be assisted directlyby&#13;
the Public FinancialManagement Reform (PFMR) project: budget execution with the AFMIS expansion,&#13;
internal control with the implementationof the accounting manual and duty specific training for Treasury&#13;
and line ministry financial managementstaff, internal audit and external with capacity building and work&#13;
practices development, payroll with systems development, procurement and accounting and reportingwith&#13;
capacity building and direct operations support, accountability through the support for a public accounts&#13;
committee in Parliament, and with monitoring of progress on reforms with the support to the Reform&#13;
ManagementUnit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25.      With this support the government-wide procurement and financial management&#13;
arrangements satisfied the fiduciary requirements for the Bank's general budget support&#13;
and the ARTF contribution to the recurrent budget. Moreover, it enabled the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         other donors to rely entirely on the government-wide treasury and audit systems for the&#13;
         financial management o f investment operations.&#13;
&#13;
         26.                                       The PACB project continues the operational support through consultant services&#13;
         to assure that basic public finance functions (procurement, treasury and audit) were&#13;
         performed so as to meet internationally accepted standards. The terms o f reference for&#13;
         these consultants also contained references to providing training but this was not the&#13;
         principle mandate. However, the scope o f its activities was broadened to include: (i)&#13;
         developing the regulatory and institutional framework in these core fiduciary&#13;
         management areas; (ii)                                                                                             further systems development that is based on a full understanding&#13;
         o f medium-term requirements and the country's implementation capacity; and&#13;
          (iii)                   capacity building and training not only in the central agencies but also in line&#13;
         ministries and the provinces so that staff could maintain and operate systems&#13;
         independently and effectively. However, this set o f activities was not well identified in&#13;
         the original design. Given the difficulties infilling positions inthe Treasury Department&#13;
         with adequate national staff and the late mobilization o f training consultants for&#13;
         prospective auditors, the project objectives were modified in late 2006 to align with the&#13;
         principle outcomes o f the activities which were the maintenance o f fiduciary&#13;
         performance.&#13;
&#13;
         27.                                          During the period 2002 to the present, donors have provided continuous&#13;
         financing for the recovery program and are pledged to continue this support. While the&#13;
         government, with World Bank and other donor technical assistance on PFM, has been&#13;
         largely successful in maintaining a stable and transparent fiscal environment, there&#13;
         continues to be general concern that the demands for procurement, treasury operations,&#13;
         budget formulation and implementation, internal and external audit, and legislative&#13;
         oversight could exceed the PFM abilities o f the MOF and agencies usingpublic funds.&#13;

        28.                                       There are a number o f lessons from the Implementation Completion Report o f&#13;
        EPAP 1, the mid-term review o f EPAP I1 and the restructuring o f the PACB project that&#13;
        the government and IDA have built into the proposed project.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
*  For an emergency operation to be effective in a severely damaged post-&#13;
    conflict environment, intensive Bank supervision i s essential.&#13;
&#13;
   Contracts for direct operations support need to be separated from capacity&#13;
   building activities to ensure that both are performed simultaneously.&#13;
   Under the EPAPs, initial capacity building suffered greatly due to the&#13;
   pressures to get the operations up and running quickly and keep them&#13;
   runninginan environment of constant flux.&#13;
&#13;
   The expectations for capacity buildingand institutional strengthening need&#13;
   to be closely aligned with the availability and skills levels o f the&#13;
    government counterparts. All assumptions regarding the availability and&#13;
    capability o f government counterpart staff need to be documented and&#13;
    validated with great care and revisitedover time.&#13;
&#13;
   The government needs to continue to engage the services of the advisors&#13;
    for as long as it takes to build sufficient, demonstrable capacity in core&#13;
   public administration areas even as the roles o f the advisors become&#13;
   increasingly transitional. The legal framework for financial management&#13;
   and procurement in Afghanistan i s now more demanding and poses&#13;
   significant new challenges to the government.&#13;
&#13;
   Treasury, Procurement and Audit Departments are all still dependent on&#13;
   external advisors to perform the key tasks; where nationals are involved in&#13;
   critical matters, these are involved as local advisors and not civil servants.&#13;
   This is a consequence o f incomplete restructuring and the failure to move&#13;
   to merit based recruitment.&#13;
&#13;
   The systems to support budgetexecution are inplace inthe MOF butthere&#13;
    i s no functionality offered under the AFMIS to support operations by the&#13;
   line ministries (ie., budget preparation, contract and grant management,&#13;
   purchasing and asset management, and personnel management) which are&#13;
   all critical to improved service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
   Reform in the MOF i s monitored by a unit in the Deputy o f&#13;
   Administration but the cross cutting issues o f the organization o f the&#13;
   ministry, human resources and the monitoring and evaluation of the&#13;
   reform's progress do not get sufficient high level attention to achieve the&#13;
   implementationo f the ministry's strategic plan.&#13;

B. Objectives,Rationaleand Strategyfor IDA's ContinuingSupport&#13;
&#13;
IDA'sReformStrategy&#13;
&#13;
29.     Inthe context ofthe recently concluded agreement on the I-ANDSand the 2007-&#13;
2010 Compact, donors and GOA have agreed that providing that the level of&#13;
transparency, accountability and good governance that has been achieved to date under&#13;
the preceding donor support operations for MOF i s maintained, that there should be a&#13;
progressive transfer o f responsibility for managing the PFM systems to the MOF and&#13;
away from reliance on the ARTF Monitoring Agent and the operations advisors for&#13;
procurement, treasury and audit.       This transition should proceed at a pace that is&#13;
consistent with the MOF and line ministries' capacity to resolve regulatory,&#13;
organizational and personnel management issues affecting sustainability. As the&#13;
administrator for one major source o f financing for the I-ANDs (ARTF) and a major&#13;
provider o f financing for both the operations and development budgets, IDA has a&#13;
particular responsibility to lead inthis effort.&#13;
&#13;
30.     The broad plan for making this transition would be: (i)continuing to provide&#13;
operational support for basic operations through the services o f internationally recruited&#13;
firms, while (ii)makingfurther steps to re-organize the MOF and line ministriesina more&#13;
de-concentrated PFM system; (iii)deepening the regulatory framework and building&#13;
humanresource capacity to facilitate mainstreaming o foperations; and (iv) managing these&#13;
changesto assure their longer term sustainability. The strategy would encompass all o fthe&#13;
major functions o f the MOF and require the coordination o f the contributions o f several&#13;
donors. Therefore, as part o f the strategy, leadership for managing the transition would be&#13;
placed inthe M O F ina specialized Reform ImplementationManagement Unit (RIMU)that&#13;
reports directly to the Minister o f Finance. This would place the ownership and&#13;
accountability for progress with the MOF. Lastly, the rate at which the transition can be&#13;
made will depend on variables and circumstances that cannot be fully accounted for ex&#13;
ante. Therefore, the implementationo f the transition and the programming o f resources to&#13;
support it would be made through annual progress and program reviews, supported by third&#13;
party "reviewers," reporting to the RIMU (see sub-component 3.1.6 o f the Detail Project&#13;
Description).&#13;
&#13;
31.     This broad plan i s largely consistent with the vision which M O F has developed&#13;
and the World Bank recommendations in "Managing Public Finance for Development."&#13;
These aimed at guidingthe M O F inidentifying and implementing a wide range o f actions&#13;
required for strengthening its current functions and capacities and moving forward from&#13;
meetingthe emergency needs o f the last four years toward a modem and effective public&#13;
financial management organization.&#13;

  33.                                    Inthe next phase o f its support for PFM, IDA'Svalue added would be to buildon&#13;
  the experience it has had through the series o f projects cited above which donors have&#13;
  acknowledged as substantial. It would then provide additional leadership in coordinating&#13;
  donor assistance beingprovided intheir respective areas o f competence from its position&#13;
  as administrator o f the ARTF.&#13;
&#13;
  Linkagewith PublicAdministrationReform&#13;
&#13;
  34.                                    The proposed project is one element of a wider public administration reform&#13;
  agenda that has been developed by the government, with IDNARTF support to&#13;
  contribute to a more effective state through better PFM performance and by building&#13;
  capacity to sustain this performance (Box 2.2). To date, in the same projects that have&#13;
  contributed to maintaining sound PFM, IDA has also provided major support for the&#13;
  restructuring o f agencies and ministries and rationalizing the functions and job&#13;
  descriptions o f public sector employees in order to pursue operational efficiencies o f&#13;
   service delivery that lead to improved developmental outcomes from public expenditures.&#13;
  In restructuring agencies, attention is being placed on establishing reliable financial&#13;
  management units that would receive the training and capacity being decentralized from&#13;
  the MOF. Major re-structuring o f the MOF itself has been part o f this effort. The focus o f&#13;
  the Public Administration Reform (PAR) is now being directed towards reform of civil&#13;
  service practices in a new Civil Service Reform (CSR) project, whose objective i s to&#13;
  increase personnel performance                                                                                                                                                                      through incentives,                                            merit-basedhiring, good&#13;
  management, and competency enhancement. Consideringthat personnel costs account for&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
about 30% o f the MTFF (about 62% o f the ordinary budget), gains in this area will be&#13;
significant for controlling costs and increasing expenditure effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
35.      Together with the CSR project, the Public Financial Management Reform&#13;
(PFMR) project helps strengthen core business practices within government, namely&#13;
human resource and financial management - through appropriate regulatory,&#13;
organizational and technical reforms.             Reforms in these areas should provide the&#13;
supporting organizational environment within which more sector-specific reforms can be&#13;
effective. Both projects support the achievement of specific triggers under PSIB as well&#13;
as benchmarks under the Afghanistan Compact.                      Both projects also support the&#13;
Government's anti-corruption strategy through identifying and addressing areas that are&#13;
vulnerable to corruption and through promoting a rules-based culture within government.&#13;
&#13;
36.      Therefore through these two operations, the CSR project and the proposed PFMR&#13;
project, IDA will contribute to the government's overall ability to execute two&#13;
interlockedbusiness practices -public financial management andpersonnel management.&#13;
&#13;
    Box 2.2: Linkageswith IDNARTF's Public Administration Reform Initiatives&#13;
A significant piece of analytical work is underway to assist the government to define priorities and&#13;
programs in Public Administration Reform. This will include specific areas of work on: how to deepen&#13;
line ministry reforms, the evolution of sub-nationalgovernance over time, and strengtheninginstitutions of&#13;
accountability. Work is progressing to define an integrated program of activities and mechanisms for&#13;
managingresources ina coordinatedway.&#13;
As part of defining work programsunder this broaderPAR framework, IDA has assistedthe governmentin&#13;
defining a realistic implementationplan for achieving its civil service reform goals in line with Compact&#13;
benchmarks. This has beenpresentedto donors for support at the April Afghanistan DevelopmentForum.&#13;
A major work program i s underway with IDA and other donor support to assist the government develop its&#13;
anticorruption strategy and to identify areas where improvements could limit the vulnerability to&#13;
corruption, including inthe area ofpublic administrationreform.&#13;
The ARTF financed Management Capacity Program is supporting the interim buying-in of Afghan&#13;
consultants into civil service positions to manage core common function departments while broader&#13;
capacitybuilding efforts take hold.&#13;

&#13;
A. Project Objective&#13;
&#13;
37.     The objectives o f the project are to: (i)develop an efficient and effective public&#13;
financial management system; and (ii)   develop the humanresource capacity o f the MOF&#13;
and CAO to ensure better operation o f public financial management.&#13;
&#13;
38.     Indicators for monitoring these performance objectives would correspond closely&#13;
to those used inthe recently completed PEFA analysis and would include: (i)     the degree&#13;
o f coherence o f budget, treasury and revenue estimates with ANDs priorities and MTFF;&#13;
(ii)thetimeliness ofbudget,treasury andrevenuepreparation andexecution; (iii)the&#13;
number of ministriedagencies successfully managing elements o f the procurement and&#13;
treasury functions with ex post control; (iv) measures o f good governance such as the&#13;
trend of the percentage of donor support transiting MOF core budget processes; and&#13;
(v) the quality of governmental audit. The project's impact would also be observed inthe&#13;
proportion o f the national budgetthat was being managed under improved line ministries&#13;
and Mustofiats, and eventually, an improvement in the rates o f implementation of&#13;
budgets that are beingmade available.&#13;
&#13;
B. Detailed Project Description&#13;
&#13;
39.     The PFMR project will be implemented over a period o f three years and will&#13;
contain the following components.&#13;
&#13;
        1.INSTITUTIONALDEVELOPMENT (US$11.4million)&#13;
&#13;
40.     The project would assist each ofthe major departments within MOF and the CAO&#13;
to develop and implement the structures, procedures and systems required to carry out&#13;
their mandates under the new PFM legal framework. The legal framework is now ahead&#13;
o f the procedures and systems to support it. The project would also assist the Treasury&#13;
Department with systems development, would assist MOF finish the procedures for&#13;
procurement, and would develop work practices for government audit.&#13;
&#13;
        1.1ProcurementInstitutionalDevelopmentand SocialAccountability&#13;
&#13;
41.     In order to cope with the urgent task of reconstruction in Afghanistan,&#13;
arrangements were put inplace under EPAP to provide `centralized' technical assistance&#13;
by means o f operations support to advisors for procurement under the Procurement Unit&#13;
o f the ARDS. ARDS managed the Procurement Advisor and recruited and trained 10&#13;
local counterpart staff as Procurement Liaison Officers who serve as liaisons with the line&#13;
ministries with an objective to ensure transfer o f procurement capacity and responsibility&#13;
to the line ministries. The Procurement Advisor also initiated a training program,&#13;
conducted a review o f procurement legislation, and prepared draft new legislation which&#13;
was finally adopted in September 2005 as the new Procurement Law inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42.      The PACB project responded to the needto transfer procurement capacity as well&#13;
as responsibility for procurement functions to the line ministries o f the government. This&#13;
required institutional development as the core component o f the procurement reform&#13;
initiative. While some o f the capacity development assistance envisaged flowed from the&#13;
Bank's previous intervention and impliedfurther training o f targeted individuals, the core&#13;
objective o f the overall plan was to develop institutional capacity. The capacity&#13;
development program was predicated on a gradual transfer of procurement responsibility&#13;
to the purchasing entities based on their demonstrated ability to house and make use o f&#13;
trained and experienced procurement officers.&#13;
&#13;
43.     The services required as part o f the procurement component o f PACB comprise:&#13;
(i)a sustainable nationwide capacity building strategy to take into account the&#13;
requirements not only o f central government but also provincial and municipal&#13;
government as well as the private sector; (ii)a program to assist and facilitate the&#13;
achievement o f PRR status for a number o f key purchasers at central and sub-central&#13;
level; (iii)planto transfer procurement capacity and responsibility to those central and&#13;
           a&#13;
sub-central purchasers according to a set o f milestones; and (iv) a system o f attestation&#13;
whereby the performance o f ministries can be assessed against identified benchmarks as&#13;
part o f the milestone mechanism. The objective was twofold: to build the capacity o f&#13;
procurement officers o f the client, its key purchasing ministries, and provincial authorities;&#13;
and to strengthen the organizational structure of the procurement function within procuring&#13;
entities with a view to transfening responsibility for procurement from ARDS to the&#13;
procuring entities themselves.&#13;
&#13;
44.     In 2005, as part of the broader review of Afghanistan's PFM system, an&#13;
assessment o f procurement procedures and performance focused on the legal framework&#13;
applicable to the conduct o f procurement inAfghanistan as well as on the performance o f&#13;
those responsible for applying the procurement procedures was carried out in 2005. The&#13;
study confirmed the scope o f procurement reform and capacity building activities under&#13;
the PACB to: (i)create a Procurement Policy Unit (PPU); (ii)        finalize and approve the&#13;
Procurement Law and draft regulations to implement it; (iii)develop and implement a&#13;
large scale capacity-building program for procurement officers in the government; and&#13;
(iv) create a training program for the local private sector to enhance its capacity to&#13;
participate inbids.&#13;
&#13;
45.     Under the PACB project, a PPU has been established under the MOF, a new&#13;
Public Procurement Law has been adopted, the procurement regulations have been&#13;
drafted, and a system has been established whereby all bidding opportunities as well as&#13;
contract awards are published in the ARDS procurement website.             However, due to&#13;
various reasons, the government could not complete selection o f a consultant for&#13;
procurement reform support (Procurement Capacity Building and Legal &amp; Institutional&#13;
Framework Development) in due course. The process o f selection has recently been&#13;
completed and the contract with the procurement support consultant was signed in&#13;
February 2007. Since only a few months o f project duration are remaining for PACB,&#13;
this component o f procurement reform, which commences under PACB, would continue to&#13;
be the central planko fthe procurement reforminitiative under the PFMRproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46.     In addition to assisting government purchasers in this way, the project will&#13;
provide institutional support for the newly created regulatory body (PPU). The PPU&#13;
requires direct assistance to carry out its functions (listed inthe Procurement Law). They&#13;
will have started down the path o f creating an information website and a basic&#13;
Management Information System (MIS) for procurement. This, however, requires&#13;
significant further input to provide a useful tool. The PPU will also have many other tasks&#13;
which will require funding, not least in respect o f the adoption o f secondary legislation&#13;
(including guidelines and manuals) and the dissemination o f information and analysis o f&#13;
data so that they can provide reports indicating the successes and failures o f the system.&#13;
The project will therefore include funds for the PPU to: (i)retain consultants to create&#13;
more Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs), a procurement manual and guidance notes;&#13;
(ii)develop the website andinteractive MIS; and(iii) the PPUfor publication,&#13;
                                                             assist&#13;
analysis and dissemination o f review panelprocedures, documentation and decisions. The&#13;
MIS to be developed for procurement will provide a database of procurement&#13;
requirements by contracting entity and track the procurement process of large&#13;
procurements to the stage o f contract award and supports the publication o f procurement&#13;
information. The AFMIS expansion will include a Purchases module which controls the&#13;
payment o f contracts once awarded (see sub-component 1.2).&#13;
&#13;
Accountability and Disclosure&#13;
&#13;
47.     Given the significant changes in the legal and regulatory framework and the&#13;
traditionally passive public response to expenditure on procurement, there is an initial needto&#13;
encourage greater public awareness o f the changes to the procurement rules and to promote&#13;
change inbehavior. The immediate needis to design aneffective and strategic communication&#13;
and procurement disclosure strategy, taking into account the specific circumstances that&#13;
prevail in the country. To better support the transition and its related capacity building&#13;
exercise, an effective communication component will be designed to raise awareness o f the&#13;
reform agenda and its implications within: (i) government (politicians, parliamentarians,&#13;
                                                the&#13;
andpublic officials); (ii) private sector (bidders, consultants suppliers, etc.); and (iii)&#13;
                          the                                                               civil&#13;
society at large (academia, non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations,&#13;
civilians). This component andthe awareness it will raise should also mitigate risks o f failure&#13;
by ensuring a wider constituency is reached, ownership creation, and dealingwith corruption&#13;
through a sound, efficient and transparent procurement process. Putting procurement out in&#13;
the openwithincivil society will also set the stage for possible future inclusion ofcivil society&#13;
in the procurement function as an oversight element once the GOA has come up with its&#13;
strategyon anti-corruption.&#13;
&#13;
48.     Inthe medium term, it is important not to lose sight of the opportunity to start&#13;
work on social accountability initiatives. Efforts will be made to discover the most&#13;
appropriate means o f educating and including civil society in the monitoring o f the&#13;
procurement function.        This should, however, be preceded by a situational&#13;
analysidassessment that would allow the development o f such a longer term strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49.     In light of this gradual approach, the project will retain a consultant for a&#13;
communications and awareness strategy (housed within PPU) and a consultant for&#13;
situational analysis/assessmentinrespect o fpossibilities for social accountability measures.&#13;
&#13;
        1.2 Treasury SystemsDevelopment and Roll-out&#13;
&#13;
50.     Over the past four years, an integrated financial management system has been&#13;
implemented in the Treasury o f the MOF. The basic objective o f this system was to&#13;
ensure accountability over the Governments budget and expenditures including the use o f&#13;
donor funds. The system was not intendedto be a complete integrated MIS that would be&#13;
capable o f serving the needs o f all government managers. It was basically a Treasury&#13;
system with FreeBalance software as the core application o f the system known as the&#13;
AFMIS.&#13;
&#13;
51.     As the government is moving forward with their reform program, the AFMIS&#13;
needs to be enhanced to meet the increasing demands on the Treasury staff as well as line&#13;
ministries and Mustofiats. The software platform for AFMIS i s FreeBalance, the systems&#13;
study carried out under the PACB project recommended keeping this platform given the&#13;
knowledge acquired and the reasonably good performance o f the core applications o f&#13;
expenditure module, general ledger, allotments, bank reconciliations and financial&#13;
reporting. These core applications give Treasury all the means to effect payments, keep&#13;
control by allotment, and report incompliance with the law and donor requirements.&#13;
&#13;
52.     The expansion should respond to the needs o f line ministrieswhere there is a need&#13;
to automate control by contract and develop controls by grant. Given that the&#13;
procurement capacity building contract will develop a procurement MIS to automate and&#13;
control the process leading up to the selection and award o f a contract, the PFMR should&#13;
provide an application for the contract control. A Purchasing Module would provide this&#13;
functionality. Similarly, the PFM law requires that each line ministry keeps a register o f&#13;
its fixed assets; giventhis and the integration provided between a Purchasing Module and&#13;
a FixedAsset Module, the AFMIS expansion should comprise Purchasing and the Fixed&#13;
Assets Module. Similarly, the recording o f revenue would be rendered more secure&#13;
through the use o f the Accounts Receivable Module.&#13;
&#13;
53.     A fully automated off-the-shelve HumanResources (HR)MISfor implementation&#13;
inMOF is also considered necessary. At present, MOF uses the Microsoft Access based&#13;
payroll system known as Verified Payroll Program which includes the Computerized&#13;
Payroll System. Nevertheless, there i s no HR functionality inthe system and the support&#13;
and documentation o f in-house systems i s not optimum. The ultimate goal for HR MIS i s&#13;
to direct deposit the net pay to each employee's bank account and provide the critical&#13;
personnel data for eventual centralizationand determination o f pensionliabilities.&#13;
&#13;
54.     A principle o f systems implementation which the team and the government&#13;
agreed i s to have same vendor applications for all integrated operations (i.e., operations&#13;
where individual transactions from the modules are required to be posted to other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
applications). Following from this it was decided that FreeBalance Purchasing, Fixed&#13;
Assets, and possibly HR Modules would be acquired to address the needs identified.&#13;
&#13;
55.     The systems study recommends the implementation o f a budget support&#13;
management system as a highpriority. Whether the FreeBalance module meets the needs&#13;
or whether another vendor's product should be used will be determined following the&#13;
study tour by the MOF's budget and treasury officials to review the performance of HR&#13;
and BudgetPreparation Modules installed inother government settings. The same vendor&#13;
principle i s not critical in this case because the Budget Preparation Module and core&#13;
accountability applications are not integrated but just interfaced with a periodic file&#13;
submission for loading the budget and updates. The systems integrator consultant&#13;
selected for the Treasury system will program the interface for the periodic uploading o f&#13;
the budget files to AFMIS and down loading o f allotment and expenditure information.&#13;
&#13;
56.     Therefore, the project would engage a firm o f consultants for up to 36 months to&#13;
acquire, install, and train national staff in the use o f the following modules from&#13;
FreeBalance in order to complete the expanded financial management functions in&#13;
AFMIS - Procurement, Fixed Assets, and Accounts Receivable. The Budget Preparation&#13;
andHRModule vendor selection will be decided subsequently.&#13;
&#13;
57.     To conduct their designated business affairs and be partners with the MOF in&#13;
distributing the growing administrative responsibilities, line ministries will require the&#13;
ability to enter transactions into AFMIS and to approve such transactions through the&#13;
Financial Controllers (Treasury staff) located within the line ministries. The project&#13;
would support the roll-out o f the AFMIS so that transaction processing and payment&#13;
authorizationmay be decentralized but that payment processing would remain centralized&#13;
withinTreasury andthe Mustofiats. This component will assist the government inrolling&#13;
out AFMIS to five or six line ministries which currently account for the majority o f&#13;
public sector non-military and non-policing functions as well as six Mustofiats. The&#13;
selection o f line ministries will be made by Treasury and Budget Departments after&#13;
considering the capacity and impact o f the roll-out. The pre-conditions for the roll-out&#13;
include the reform o f the Administration Department o fthe line ministry to a point where&#13;
staff are under the PRR, the organization and duties o f all financial management staff are&#13;
clear and documented and the line ministry enters into a written understanding with the&#13;
MOF on its obligations for the roll-out and using AFMIS, and the line ministry provide&#13;
the infrastructure to allow the installation of the terminals. Inaddition to the full roll-out&#13;
to six line ministries, the consultant will assist the government in rolling out just the&#13;
reporting module o fthe AFMIS to additional line ministries.&#13;
&#13;
        1.3Internal Audit Work Practices&#13;
&#13;
58.     To date the internal audit activities in line ministries and agencies have been&#13;
under the control o f the CAO and have been oriented towards detecting frauds and&#13;
irregularities by line ministries' staffs. The Public Expenditure and Financial&#13;
Management (PEFM) Law and its financial regulations have transferred control o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
internal audit from the CAO to the MOF by providing that the MOF appoint internal&#13;
auditors to audit the financial and accounting affairs o f all state administrations.&#13;
&#13;
59.     Initial steps have been taken under the PACB project to build a modem Internal&#13;
Audit Department in the MOF, including the recruitment o f more accounting specialists&#13;
and initial training o f recruits ininternal auditing techniques, and the formation o f a high&#13;
level Audit Committee to oversee the department's work. Steps being undertaken by a&#13;
consultant appointed under PACB include preparing an internal audit manual, various&#13;
audit procedures for financial functions, and work programs for internal audits within the&#13;
MOF.&#13;
&#13;
60.     The project would now support implementation of the expanded MOF&#13;
responsibility through development o f improved audit methodology and training. The&#13;
project would also finance further development and roll-out o f internal audit procedures&#13;
and plans to the line ministries and provinces, and to improve the capacities of the&#13;
internal audit staff through on thejob training.&#13;
&#13;
61.     The consultant will be hired to provide work practice tools and on-the-job training&#13;
to the cadre o f internal auditors that are engaged inproviding internal audit services inthe&#13;
MOF and the line ministries. Work practice tools will be developed inthe form o f a new&#13;
internal audit manual that covers the requirements o f Financial Regulations 11.5 to 11.10&#13;
including issues o f internal audit organization, management, planning, conduct, reporting,&#13;
and follow-up. The on-the-job training will involve leading the auditors inthese ministries&#13;
incarrying out and reporting some 80 major investment projects (selected on the basis of&#13;
their value and implementation complexity that could disguise fraud) during the period of&#13;
the engagementto buildproficiencies to levels that accord with International Internal Audit&#13;
standards.&#13;
&#13;
62.     The CAO has undertaken a significant number o f audits that have identified&#13;
possible malfeasance and the Auditor General has referred cases to the Attorney General&#13;
for possible prosecution. There i s a need for similar findings by internal auditors to be&#13;
referred to a fraud investigation unit prior to consideration o f prosecution or disciplinary&#13;
action. The component will assist with establishing a fraud investigation unit in the&#13;
MOF's Internal Audit Department, developing and launching its basic operational skills,&#13;
and preparing a roadmap for developing specialist fraud investigation processes in&#13;
Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
        1.4 Supportfor ExternalAudit&#13;
&#13;
1.4.1 Advisory Services&#13;
&#13;
63.     The CAO is reforming its organization, methods and operations. Major training&#13;
efforts are inprocess to improve the skills o f the audit staff. The CAO, with World Bank&#13;
funding, has used a professionalaccounting firm to provide guidance to the CAO inthese&#13;
matters and there i s a need for a senior advisor to the Auditor General on a full-time basis&#13;
to continue improving the CAO's performance and to build capacity to fulfill its mandate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
underthe law. A new Audit Law is inpreparation and the advisor will be neededto assist&#13;
with implementation o f new audit manuals and training the CAO in functions set out in&#13;
the PEFM and draft Audit Laws.&#13;
&#13;
64.     The project would finance the services of a senior audit advisor for policy&#13;
guidance which has beenongoing since 2006 and strengthening o f the CAO which would&#13;
allow the direct operations advisor firm to concentrate on delivering audit services. The&#13;
advisor would be supported by three audit experts available on a full time basis to work&#13;
as audit team leaders and provide on-the-job training to the CAO staff.&#13;
&#13;
1.4.2 ExternalAudit Developmentof PhysicalInfrastructure&#13;
                       -&#13;
65.     The CAO has moved to new accommodations and requires improved physical&#13;
infrastructure for their operations.       The project would finance improved physical&#13;
infrastructure including the Information Technology Center, office furnishings and on-&#13;
line access to AFMIS. The CAO has identified its requirements including computers and&#13;
relevant software for the field and central audit staff, necessary terminals to connect with&#13;
the AFMIS to support more efficient auditing, appropriate Computer Assisted Audit&#13;
Techniques, office furniture, and work stations.&#13;
&#13;
1.4.3 ExternalAudit ParliamentaryOversight&#13;
                       -&#13;
&#13;
66.     The project will support operationalizing the recent decision to establish the&#13;
Parliamentary Oversight Committee function, and reinforce and reinvigorate the&#13;
accountability o f the Executive in the management o f public finances to the legislature&#13;
through a timely, comprehensive, and methodical review o f audit reports and audited&#13;
accounts o f the government.&#13;
&#13;
67.     Exposure to a well tested system o f legislative scrutiny o f public spending in the&#13;
context o f a similar political system will help to create awareness o f international best&#13;
practice, and provide the Committee Chairman and Auditor General with much needed&#13;
knowledge and understanding of: (i)      a tested approach to the timely processing o f audit&#13;
reports and accounts; (ii)   constitution and powers (including understanding o f member&#13;
nomination procedures, tabling o f schedules, nominating a Chair); and (iii)means&#13;
through which to promote accountability and transparency. This sub-component will be&#13;
managed by the CAO and provide management assistance, training, and operating&#13;
support to build the capacity o f members o f the parliamentary committee in their&#13;
oversight function as well as supporting secretariat and technical assistance aimed at&#13;
strengtheningthe administrative support to the committee.&#13;
&#13;
        2. HUMANRESOURCESCAPACITYDEVELOPMENT (US$5.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
68.     The transfer o f skills to civil servants to operate PFM systems lies at the heart o f&#13;
sustainability o f adequate PFM performance. Under this component, the project would&#13;
provide consultants, training opportunities, and materials for the development o f skills o f&#13;
MOF staff, line ministry staff, and CAO staff. In selecting staff for training, which in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
turnleadsto advancement, the MOF and the CAO will be sensitive to and follow gender-&#13;
sensitive policies.&#13;
&#13;
69.     Given a three-year project life, it is not expected that the MOF and the CAO&#13;
would acquire the full range and level o f skills to assume complete responsibility to&#13;
operate unaided all the PFM systems by the end o f project date. However, while the exact&#13;
end-state i s not known at this time, advances along the continuum will be treated as solid&#13;
progress inthe right direction.&#13;
&#13;
70.     By project end, however, the MOF staff will have acquired the skills to interpret&#13;
and apply the PFM laws and regulations for dealing with the routine and current state o f&#13;
budget execution, reporting and control. The nature o f the technical assistance will&#13;
transition away from direct operations support as capacity grows. While some direct&#13;
operations support will be required for the maintenance and further development o f the&#13;
AFMIS, most technical assistance beyond the current project would be for policy&#13;
formulation and implementing further reforms.&#13;
&#13;
71.     Similarly, the CAO will have progressed to a point where its staff can conduct&#13;
routine review o f compliance and simple project financial statement audits with the&#13;
assistance o f an external audit manager to ensure adherence to current auditing standards.&#13;
Beyond the project life direct assistance would be required for conducting audit o f State&#13;
Owned Enterprises and complex projects, while the state budget audit could be done with&#13;
the limitedinvolvement o f an audit advisor for quality control purposes. As inthe case of&#13;
MOF beyond the current project, technical assistance would be required for policy&#13;
formulation and implementingfurther reforms.&#13;
&#13;
72.     The capacity o f line ministry staff to carry out procurement should, on the other&#13;
hand, advance to a point where at least in the targeted ministries this staff will assume&#13;
responsibility for procurement with the mandated supervision o fthe PPUo f MOF.&#13;
&#13;
        2.1 Human Resource CapacityDevelopmentin Procurement&#13;
&#13;
73.     Interms o f individual training needs, the continuing need to provide purchasing&#13;
entities with a competent cadre o f procurement officers will be fulfilled through the&#13;
continuation o f the training programs developed initially by the procurement agents&#13;
retained under EPAP I.The training activities o f the procurement capacity building&#13;
contract outlined in sub-component 1.1 will be delivered under this sub-component and&#13;
will be rolled-out more widely, especially to local government entities as well as to&#13;
specialist audiences such as decision makers and auditors. Further effort will be made to&#13;
ensure that there i s a private sector able to respond adequately to (and, where necessary,&#13;
challenge) the public purchaser in the changed procurement environment. The training&#13;
needs at sub-central level will be identifiedthrough the training needs assessment.&#13;
&#13;
74.     As a result and inaddition to continuing with the existing training program under&#13;
the PACB project, this project will provide more training at sub-central level, more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
private sector workshops, specific training programs for the PPU staff, and a training&#13;
program for dispute panels.&#13;
&#13;
        2.2 Human Resource CapacityDevelopmentin Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
75.     This sub-component will assist the MOF Treasury Department and the&#13;
administration departments o f selected line ministries in developing staff capacity in&#13;
financial management functions. The program would be based on the training needs&#13;
assessment that was conducted in 2006 for Treasury in the PACB project and additional&#13;
training needs assessments may be conducted in the line ministries to be engaged inthe&#13;
decentralization process. Training in line ministries will be done in close coordination&#13;
with the Budget Department to take any opportunity joint training with assistance&#13;
provided by the Budget Department. Up to 200 staff could be affected. In addition to&#13;
providing trainers and materials for duty specific training, for developing a pool o f staff&#13;
with higher accounting skills, the project will also provide funds to reimburse Treasury&#13;
staff for attending classes conducted by private entities such as the ACCA.&#13;
&#13;
        2.3 Human Resource CapacityDevelopmentin Audit&#13;
&#13;
76.     The project would complete the classroom training inintroductory accounting and&#13;
auditingthat beganunder the PACB project for the first batch o f internal auditors o f the&#13;
MOF and staff o f the CAO. Additionally, a stream o f internal auditors and CAO auditors&#13;
intended to provide leadership and more expert skills will be financed for advanced&#13;
training. The Association o f Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) professional&#13;
accountant training now available in Kabul could be used for this purpose for staff who&#13;
would become senior leaders in the Internal Audit Department and CAO. Selection o f&#13;
officers for this training should be based on career development plans and the likelihood&#13;
that they can contribute over the mid-term to development o f the Internal Audit&#13;
Department and the CAO.&#13;
&#13;
        3. REFORMMANAGEMENT (US$1.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
77.     The processes o f coordinating support for improvements in M O F functions and&#13;
for assuring the improvements are well aligned across departments and with other line&#13;
ministriesandMustofiats would be managedthrough a newly-formed RIMU.The RIMU&#13;
would be responsible for developing annual work plans which would assure the&#13;
coordination o f actions proposed in various departments, monitoring implementationo f&#13;
these actions so that the overall results o f the project and the M O F strategic plan are&#13;
achieved. This latter function has been initiated by the MOF. It would also be responsible&#13;
for assuring that new personnel policies for the civil service being developed and&#13;
supported by the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission&#13;
(IARCSC) are properly integratedinto the MOF's own HR management department.&#13;
&#13;
78.     While it i s important that there be continuity in applying actions to improve&#13;
performance, the RIMUwould be treated as a "task force" with a finite life and not as a&#13;
permanentline agency o f the MOF. Throughthis arrangement the MOF managerialteam&#13;
(minister, deputy ministers, and director generals) would be provided with options and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
alternatives for making further improvements in overall ministerial functionality. The&#13;
work o f the RIMU would also allow the management o f the M O F to conclude&#13;
arrangements with other line ministries and Mustofiats covering their roles and&#13;
responsibilities in implementing de-concentrated PFM functions. To meet its objectives,&#13;
the RIMUwould undertake the following tasks.&#13;
&#13;
         3.1.1 TargetedRestructuring of Internal MOF BusinessArrangements&#13;
&#13;
79.      The RIMU would assure that the various fhctions and relationships between&#13;
targeted MOF departments were organized to be mutually supporting inproviding efficient&#13;
PFM. It would draw on the support beingoffered through the IARCSC (being supported by&#13;
an IDA grant supporting reforms inthe civil service) to rapidly reviewandrevise, as needed,&#13;
decisions made under the PRR for the allocation o f functional responsibilities, lines of&#13;
authority and reporting, and the level and types o f staffing required to exercise these&#13;
functions. The IARCSC with financing o f the CSR project would assist the MOF/RIMU to&#13;
acquire the services o f an internationally recognized expert inthe operations o f macro-level&#13;
public finance institutions such as ministries o f finance, treasury boards, central banking&#13;
institutions to diagnose intra-institutional organizational issues inthe MOF, propose solutions&#13;
andsupport their implementation over aperiodofabout 36 months.&#13;
&#13;
80.      The RIMUwould then work with department heads and staff to implement any&#13;
restructuring that is recommended. It would pursue a "change                    management"&#13;
methodology that would involve the participation o f the staff that would be affected in&#13;
understanding the rationale for changes, receive feedback on proposals and build&#13;
commitment and ownership o f changes as they came into effect.&#13;
&#13;
         3.1.2 Staff Re-grading under the GOA PayIGradingPolicy&#13;
&#13;
81.      The recently completed PRR process produced revised job descriptions and&#13;
statements o f qualifications for virtually all o f the MOF 220 higher level staff (grades 2&#13;
and above) and about 70% o f 5,700 lower level staff (grades 3 and below). The RIMU&#13;
would arrange with the IARCSC for applying the new grade and pay policy o f the&#13;
government with support provided through the CSR project. The IARCSC Pay and&#13;
Grade Unit would work with the RIMUand MOF HR Department to re-map the revised&#13;
job descriptions into the new %grade system, and complete the task o f defining newjob&#13;
descriptions to correspond to the new 8-grade system where this was required. Staff o f&#13;
the MOF HR Department would be trained in creating and grading job descriptions as&#13;
part o f the process. The IARCSC Pay and Grade Unit, supported by its own team o f&#13;
international experts, would then prepare confidential reports recommending the re-&#13;
assignment o f incumbents of former positions into the newly graded positions.&#13;
&#13;
         3.1.3 Supportfor theHuman ResourcesManagement (HRM) Department&#13;
&#13;
82.      The RIMUwould facilitate the strengtheningo f the HRMDepartment to position&#13;
it to perform new personnel management functions beingdeveloped under the GOA civil&#13;
service reform strategy. It would arrange with the IARCSC to train and mentor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MOF/HRM staff to apply new operational procedures and manuals as they are developed&#13;
under the CSR project covering: (i) for positions graded 3 and below following&#13;
                                          hiring&#13;
merit-based practices; (ii)   assessing individualjob performance; (iii) managing personnel&#13;
assignments, re-assignments, promotions and sanctions; and (iv) applying separation&#13;
policies. Incoordination with the CSR project, the RIMU would facilitate the placement&#13;
of a human resources management expert for 36 months to assist the MOF HRh4&#13;
Department to re-organize so as to accommodate the management o f new civil service&#13;
regulations, and to mentor staff inapplying the training and new operational norms.&#13;
&#13;
        3.1.4 Preparation of New Human Resources Management Initiatives&#13;
&#13;
83.     The MOF would be expected to make three major strategic decisions to sustain&#13;
the effects o ftraining, pay reform, and improved personnel management:&#13;
&#13;
                 Initiating "schemes o f service" to permit the M O F to be competitive in&#13;
                 recruiting and retaining professionals in selected professional streams&#13;
                 considered critical for the long term performance o f PFM fimctions withinthe&#13;
                 framework o f the new grading and pay system. While the new grade and pay&#13;
                 system would be adequate for motivating and promoting staff and rewarding&#13;
                the performance of most general civil service fimctions in the MOF, select&#13;
                professions including accounting, procurement management, government&#13;
                 auditing have special job descriptions, qualifications and certifications, and&#13;
                remuneration requirements that should be recognized if individuals in these&#13;
                 fields are to become experienced and long term public servants. The RIMU&#13;
                 and HRM Department would prepare a proposal for installing "schemes of&#13;
                 service" for these three professional categories with the assistance o f&#13;
                 international experts inthe matter, andwhen agreed, launch its application;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          0      Reducing the reliance on internationally recruited technical assistance in&#13;
                 line functions o f the MOF would be an important element in establishing&#13;
                the longer term sustainability of Afghanistan's              public financial&#13;
                 management system. The current level o f credibility o f MOF's financial&#13;
                management practices i s being assured by the extensive use o f&#13;
                 international and national contractors which is not considered to be&#13;
                 sustainable in the long run. In 2007 there are 76 full time expatriate&#13;
                 consultants and 200 "local advisors" working primarily in line duties in&#13;
                the MOF. The RIMUwould collaborate with the respective departments&#13;
                inMOF on a diagnosis of continuing needs, an inventory o fpositions that&#13;
                could be "nationalized" considering available human resource capacity,&#13;
                and a timetable for making the transfers; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          0     Introducing gender-sensitive personnel practices. While there i s not a&#13;
                national standard for recognizing and addressing the special requirements&#13;
                o f women inthe Afghan work force, the M O F would initiate: (i)baseline&#13;
                                                                                    a&#13;
                survey to develop intelligence on the numbers and status o f women&#13;
                currently employed and diagnose issues that impede their productive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               contributions; and (ii)  design actions that could be implemented within&#13;
               current legal constraints to remove obstacles and promote further&#13;
               participation o f women inthe MOF workforce.&#13;
&#13;
        3.1.5 PFMR Project CoordinationandAdministration&#13;
&#13;
84.     The RIMU would coordinate the implementation of the components of the&#13;
project. It would also coordinate through the use o f the annual work plan for MOF, the&#13;
implementation o f the PFMR project with the projects being financed in parallel, for&#13;
examplethe DFID support to the Budget Department.&#13;
&#13;
85.     For the next three years, the RIMUwould assume responsibilities for day-to-day&#13;
project administration including the: (i)administration o f contracts with international&#13;
firms (including those not supported by the IDA Grant), as well as monitoring&#13;
performance under these contracts; and for (ii)project related procurement, financial&#13;
management, and accountability for safeguards. The Administration Department would&#13;
participate inthese tasks and assume control by the end o f the third project year.&#13;
&#13;
        3.1.6 Monitoringand Evaluation of Results&#13;
&#13;
86.     The RIMU would temporarily incorporate the MOF Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Unit (M&amp;EU)to assure coherence between monitoring and evaluation of results and the&#13;
development and re-development o f reform work programs. The unit and RIMU would&#13;
produce an Annual Performance Review (APR) with emphasis on the benchmarks&#13;
contained inthe Results Framework, as well as a review o f actions that had been taken. It&#13;
would cover all reform measures undertaken inthe MOF, notjust those supported by the&#13;
PFMR project.&#13;
&#13;
        4. DIRECT OPERATIONALSUPPORTFOR PFMFUNCTIONS&#13;
        (USS16.0million)&#13;
&#13;
87.     The goals o f the government include maintaining appropriate fiduciary standards&#13;
to provide reasonable assurance to the Afghan public and to international donors that&#13;
government resources and donor funds are subject to appropriate budget and expenditure&#13;
controls. This has been achieved during the reconstruction period with the assistance o f&#13;
direct operations support based on internationally recruited consultant firms for&#13;
procurement, treasury and external audit. Moreover, the Mid-Term Review o f the PACB&#13;
project indicated that because o f the limited progress in progress in capacity building o f&#13;
civil service skills in PFM, there i s a need for continuing the direct operations support&#13;
under a new PFM technical assistance operation on with the World Bank. It is also&#13;
recognized that the outputs o f these contracts provide the fiduciary framework that the&#13;
government has agreed for the PSIB and for the ARTF contribution to the recurrent&#13;
budget. The PFM action plan soon to be committed to by the government is also directly&#13;
supported by the outputs o f the direct operations support contracts. By the end o f the&#13;
project, however, the nature o f support needed to procurement, treasury and audit will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
have evolved to that o f supervision, policy advice, and assistance for reform rather than&#13;
for the execution o fthe day-to-day operations.&#13;
&#13;
88.      While the project's approach to direct operations support recognizes that this type&#13;
o f technical assistance i s still necessary for the medium term, it looks for this round o f&#13;
'contracts to contribute to building the skills for the Afghanistan public sector by two&#13;
means: (i)   on-the-job training for civil servants who will be acquiring basic knowledge&#13;
under the HR Development component o f this project with the direct operations&#13;
consultant firms; and (ii)   by including inthe technical assistance teams under the direct&#13;
operations support contracts a larger share o f local advisors with concrete deliverables for&#13;
the transfer o f knowledge and skills for the operation of the PFM systems. This will&#13;
contribute to a pool o f local advisors highly trained in public financial management and&#13;
provide sustainability as an alternative to international support infuture inthe form o f in-&#13;
country expertise which would complement the knowledge and skills o f the civil service.&#13;
&#13;
         4.1 Direct OperationsSupportfor Procurement&#13;
&#13;
89.      There are currently two forms o f direct operational support for procurement&#13;
funded by the PACB.&#13;
&#13;
90.      First, the services o f a central procurement facilitation consultant directly support&#13;
line ministries with the procurement process with both procurement o f donor programs&#13;
and domestically funded procurement. The consultant works under the Ministry of&#13;
Economy (MOE) and an allowance i s included to cover operating costs o f the MOE&#13;
Procurement Unitwhile the consultant services are required.&#13;
&#13;
91.     While these consultant services and support will be continued under the scope o f&#13;
the proposed project, the decentralization process envisaged through the transfer of&#13;
procurement responsibilities which i s integral to this project will mean that the need for&#13;
such direct operational support will decrease significantly over time. Six line ministries&#13;
are targeted for de-concentration o f procurement following the training and certification&#13;
under the capacity building of Component 1. Under the existing arrangement, the&#13;
procurement facilitating consultants' team is located at the ARDS; however, a different&#13;
approach is envisaged to be followed under the current proposed project whereby the&#13;
team leader o f the consultants' team will be located at the ARDS and all other key staff&#13;
will be located at the line ministries. Through this modified approach, the procurement&#13;
facilitating consultant will not only be able have better interaction with the line ministries&#13;
butwill also be able to mentor the line ministries' procurement staff.&#13;
&#13;
92.     Second, the PPU within the MOF is receivingdirect support through the funding o f&#13;
its director (an international consultant) and core staff who are tasked with setting up the&#13;
PPUand makingit operational. This short term support will continue underthis component&#13;
to enable the PPU to begin its functions while a full complement o f local staff i s being&#13;
recruited andtrained inall the requiredfunctions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               32&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        4.2 Direct Operations Support to Treasury Operations&#13;
&#13;
93.     During the reconstruction MOF has maintained high levels of accountability in&#13;
part through the assistance of a consultancy services to Treasury financed by earlier&#13;
World Bank projects. The demand for transparency and accountability for the use o f&#13;
public resources i s growing in Afghanistan and meeting the requirements for reform,&#13;
accountability and transparency will constrain the pace at which M O F can reduce its&#13;
dependence on international supported staff and contracted services. The project will&#13;
continue to provide operational support for the Treasury functions through the services o f&#13;
internationally recruited firms.&#13;
&#13;
94.     Activities under this sub-component will include: operational support and on-the-&#13;
job training in accounting and reporting, cash management, payroll processing, grant&#13;
management, and payment processing as well as maintenance and operation o f AFMIS.&#13;
The contractor will put more emphasis than in the past on using local advisors and&#13;
transferring a requisite minimumlevel of skills to them to operate the PFM systems by&#13;
project end.&#13;
&#13;
        4.3 Direct Operations Support to ExternalAudit&#13;
&#13;
95.     The scarcity o f qualified accountants and the lack o f understanding o f financial&#13;
statement audits within the CAO have required that the audit advisor firm play a&#13;
significant role in the conduct o f audits since 2002. During this period, the CAO has&#13;
completed, with the assistance o f the audit operations advisors, the audit o f all o f the&#13;
World Bank and ARTF funded projects, and the capacity o f the CAO staff has improved&#13;
under the on-the-job training supplied by the firms during the audits. These steps have&#13;
been successful inre-establishing the CAO as a working institution capable o f absorbing&#13;
institutional strengthening assistance, but it has not developed the institution and its staff&#13;
sufficiently for them to conduct financial statement audits to international standards&#13;
without continuing professionalassistance.&#13;
&#13;
96.     This sub-component will first finance the consultant services to conduct with the&#13;
CAO the external audit o f donor projects. An important objective i s achieving&#13;
compliance with the International Standards o f Auditing (ISAs).      The audit operations&#13;
advisors financed by the World Bank projects have not yet participated in audit o f the&#13;
government-wide financial statements. The passage o f the PEFM Law necessitates that&#13;
the CAO make greater use o f the advisor in these audits which should be done in&#13;
accordance with the ISAs. The firm will also assist with state budget audit during the&#13;
period o f the PFMR project.&#13;
&#13;
97.     Similarly, the selection criteria for the operations advisor will consider the share&#13;
o f local advisors in the team who are following some accreditation program in&#13;
accounting. Team members are expected to acquire the core skills for audit field work by&#13;
the end o f the project life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98.     Cost Estimates. The cost estimated for each component in Table 3.1 is based on&#13;
calculations performed by the Bank team using unit rates on contracts under the current&#13;
PACB project.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        5. POTENTIAL RISKSAND MITIGATION&#13;
&#13;
99.     The PFMR project would be implementedin a high risk environment created by&#13;
an uncertain security situation and general weakness in Afghanistan's institutional&#13;
capacity for implementing operations. These risks are largely beyond the control of the&#13;
MOF. Conversely, there is a high degree of consensus among donors and officials that&#13;
reform in the MOF and the overall PFM system is critical and that there is strong&#13;
ownership by current MOF leadership of a strategy for change. Safeguards issues&#13;
(environmental, social) are not likely to arise as the project is designed to maintain&#13;
fiduciary controls while gradually introducing reforms.&#13;
&#13;
100.    However, the project also faces significant implementation risks that derive from&#13;
its being essentially an institution development and capacity building operation including&#13;
those presentedinTable 3.2.&#13;

 101.   The PFMR project will be implemented over a period o f 36 months under the&#13;
following arrangements,&#13;
&#13;
1. Governance and Management Structure&#13;
&#13;
102.     The project would be implemented under the authority o f the Minister o f&#13;
Finance. He would chair and be assisted by a PFM Reform Steering Committee,&#13;
comprising senior M O F departmental managers (Treasury, Budget, Internal Audit,&#13;
Administration, PPU), a representative o f the M O E (responsible for procurement&#13;
operations support) and a representative o f the CAO to maintain focus on results, good&#13;
communications, a consolidated view o f the reform, and any necessary policy and&#13;
regulatory improvements. This committee i s a successor to the advisory committee&#13;
overseeing the PACB.&#13;
&#13;
103.    Daily operations o f the project would be organized and coordinated for a newly&#13;
formed RIMU.The RIMUwould report to the Minister and assist him as the "secretariat"&#13;
for deliberations o f the PFM Reform Steering Committee. This practice would follow, in&#13;
effect, that already employed by the M&amp;EU monitoring the implementationo f the MOF&#13;
Strategic Plan. The specific roles o f the RIMUwould be to: (i)   prepare the overall plan&#13;
o f actions with the contributions o f the various departments and donors making&#13;
contributions; (ii) coordinate actions to assure mutual support and cross-functional&#13;
efficiency; (iii)monitor progress; and (iv) evaluate the intendedresults. This would cover&#13;
all project-supported activities including those implemented through the M O E and the&#13;
CAO as well as activities financed by other donor partners (for example the Department&#13;
for International Development-UK [DFID], supporting the development o f the Budget&#13;
Department).&#13;
&#13;
104.    Managers o f the various MOF departments being supported through the project&#13;
(and by other donors) would be responsible for achieving their own results within the&#13;
MOF annual work plan once they are agreed.&#13;
&#13;
2. Specific Implementation Arrangements for Project Components&#13;
&#13;
105.    Each component and sub-component would follow daily implementation&#13;
arrangements specific to the needs of the department being assisted and tasks to be&#13;
performed. These responsibilities are summarized in Table 4.1. The RIMU Director&#13;
would convene periodic meetings o f these working level authorities to identify and&#13;
resolve implementation issues that were outside the scope o ftheir individual authorities.&#13;
&#13;
106.    The Treasury Department, MOE, and CAO would also be ultimately responsible&#13;
for the performance o f line ministries in executing their specific areas o f expertise&#13;
following the decentralization o f PFM functions. The implementation of the roll-out o f&#13;
AFMIS will be done in conjunction with the Budget Department given the coverage of&#13;

 allotment and contract control now under their responsibility which will be affected by&#13;
 the roll-out. However, the RIMU would assist in coordinating the execution of de-&#13;
 centralization process from an institutional development perspective. The RIMUwould&#13;
 collaborate with the managers o f the departments concerned to assure that critical&#13;
 agreements affecting the decentralization process have been or are being resolved&#13;
 including: selecting the line ministries to be assisted; setting preconditions to be met by&#13;
  line ministries prior to being supported in adopting PFM functions; defining procedures&#13;
 and processes for maintaining work flows between MOF and the line ministries and&#13;
 quality control; and assuring adequate training and materials for line ministry staff.&#13;

 3. Coordination with Donors and with the PAR Strategy&#13;
&#13;
   107.                                 The RIMU would conduct two closely related annual events that would include&#13;
 the participation of donors and other stakeholders. The APR would report on the&#13;
  achievement o f results and evaluate progress considering the benchmarks set for the&#13;
 project and expectations set out in the previous years' annual work program. The APR&#13;
 would diagnose issues and lead to recommendations for modifying work programs,&#13;
 regulations or implementation arrangements. An annual work programming exercise,&#13;
 which would account for the results o f the APR, would also include the participation o f&#13;
  donors and account for changes intheir support activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108.    The government i s committed to public administration reform and its strategy has&#13;
recently evolved to encompass deep reforms within line ministries, improvements in&#13;
institutions o f oversight such as the judiciary and Parliament, and over the longer term,&#13;
evolution inthe role o f sub-national institutions o f governance and enhanced civil society&#13;
engagement. Reform o f the PFM in the MOF, MOE, CAO and other line ministries and&#13;
sub-national bodies i s a critical element o f the overall GOA PAR strategy and program&#13;
considering its role in determining civil service pay and responsibilities for determining&#13;
the rate at which PFM functions can be transferred to line ministries and agencies. The&#13;
MinisterofFinance is a member ofthe PAR SteeringCommittee which oversees the civil&#13;
service reform and general PARprogram.&#13;
&#13;
4. ProcurementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
109.    Afghanistan has made considerable efforts to establish the Legal and Regulatory&#13;
Framework for procurement in the last five years with the donor support. A new&#13;
Procurement Law reflecting the best international practices in public procurement has&#13;
been enacted in November 2005 replacing the earlier Procurement Regulations. The&#13;
Afghanistan Procurement Regulations and Procedures have been prepared and awaiting&#13;
the clearance from the Ministry o f Justice and the Cabinet o f Ministers. A Special&#13;
Procurement Commission which will be responsible to review the contract award&#13;
recommendations for contracts exceeding US$500,000 will be operational in April 2007.&#13;
A Manual of Procedures for Procurement Appeal and Review has been preparedand the&#13;
system will beginto be operational by April 2007. Afghanistan-specific bidding/proposal&#13;
documents will be prepared by December 2007. Bidding opportunities for all major&#13;
contracts and the contract awards are published in the ARDS website under the MOE.&#13;
ARDS-PU i s currently issuing the bidding documents to all the potential bidders&#13;
electronically free o f charge. The above actions will increase the transparency and the&#13;
confidence o f the business community. However, much needs to be done in&#13;
dissemination o f the new law/regulations/procedures/appeal mechanism to all the stake&#13;
holders o f government and the business community. A technical assistance operation i s in&#13;
place to carry out an intensive and extensive capacity building program. Action will be&#13;
simultaneously taken to develop procurement proficient personnel with an accreditation&#13;
system. In addition GOA would seek opportunities to get the civil society involved to&#13;
provide an oversight inthe adherence to transparency inthe process.&#13;
&#13;
110.    Most o f the procurement under the project will be for the provision o f technical&#13;
assistance through firmshdividuals which would provide assistance corresponding to&#13;
each o f the components and sub-components to MOF/MOE and CAO. ARDS-PU shall&#13;
assist all the implementing agencies to carryout procurement o f major consultancies&#13;
including high value individual assignments and all goods following International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures other&#13;
than the assignment for selection o f a firm to manage the Procurement Unit. The&#13;
implementingagencies will provide technical inputs inpreparation o f terms of reference&#13;
and specifications and take the lead in carrying out technical evaluations. The&#13;
procurement departments o f each implementing agency will be responsible for the&#13;
procurement o f small value goods contracts following Shopping and Direct Contracting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
procedures. RIMU will take the lead in coordinating activities among all agencies.&#13;
Actual tenderingwould be managed by the ARDS. A summary o f procurement methods&#13;
i s given inAnnex C.&#13;
&#13;
111.    The Financial Officer of the RIMU would be responsible for contract&#13;
administration, and with the user department, shall monitor compliance with terms o f&#13;
reference/compliance to the agreed specifications.&#13;
&#13;
5. FinancialManagement, Disbursementand Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
112.    A PFM performance rating system has been recently developed for Afghanistan&#13;
by the PEFA multi-agency partnership program which includes the World Bank, IMF,&#13;
European Commission, and other agencies. Afghanistan's ratings against the PFM&#13;
performance indicators portray a public sector where financial resources are, by and&#13;
large, being used for their intended purposes as authorized by a budget that i s processed&#13;
withtransparency andhas contributedto aggregate fiscal discipline.&#13;
&#13;
113.    At the project level, financial management will be coordinated by the RIMU of&#13;
the MOF. The RIMUwouldreportto the Minister of Finance as hisproject executive arm&#13;
and will also serve as the "secretariat" for deliberations o f the PFM Reform Steering&#13;
Committee. A Financial Management Specialist will be recruited at RIMU with&#13;
responsibility for financial management activities of the project which will include&#13;
processing o f consultants and suppliers invoices for payments (Le., preparing M-16 forms&#13;
payment orders); maintaining relevant accounting records; preparing required monthly,&#13;
quarterly and annual reports; coordinating with other component implementing entities to&#13;
ensure that adequate financial management requirements are met; liaising with the&#13;
Special Disbursements Unit (SDU) to ensure that the Designated Account (DA) i s&#13;
replenishedwhen due; and responding to project audits.&#13;
&#13;
114.    At the implementing entities responsible for the other components, a dedicated&#13;
manager and an accounts officer will be assigned by these entities to ensure that they&#13;
maintain adequate records andpreparetechnical andfinancial reports oftheir activities.&#13;
&#13;
115.    Quarterly un-audited financial statements will be prepared by the RIMU&#13;
accounting unit. Consolidated project reports will be prepared, reviewed, and approved&#13;
by the MOF, supported by the FM Advisor. A DA will be opened at Da Afghanistan&#13;
Bank (DAB, Central Bank). The DA will be maintained by the MOF. Withdrawal&#13;
applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly. Financial management&#13;
arrangements for the project are detailed inAnnex D.&#13;
&#13;
116.    Funds Flow. Funds management for the project will follow existing procedures.&#13;
As with all public expenditure, all payments under the project will be routed through&#13;
MOF. The FMAdvisor will assist the MOF inexecuting and recordingproject payments.&#13;
In keeping with current practices for other projects in Afghanistan, the DA will be&#13;
operated by the SDU inthe Treasury DepartmentMOF. Requests for payments from DA&#13;
funds will be made to the SDU by RIMU. In addition to payments from DA funds,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            39&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
RIMU can also request the SDU to make direct payments to consultants or consulting&#13;
firms and special commitments for contracts covered by letters of credit. Such requests&#13;
will follow World Bank procedures.        All withdrawal applications to IDA including&#13;
replenishment, reimbursement, and direct payment applications will be prepared and&#13;
submittedby MOF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
117.     Accounting and Reporting. A Financial Management Manual will be prepared&#13;
by RIMU documenting the financial management arrangements for the project. The&#13;
manual will outline guidelines for project activities including specific requirements for&#13;
each component implementing entity, and establish a project financial management&#13;
system in accordance with standard Afghan government policies and procedures. This&#13;
will include use o f the Chart o f Accounts developed by the Treasury to record project&#13;
expenditure. Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in MOF, through the SDU&#13;
and supported by the FM Advisor. Consolidated Project Financial Statements will be&#13;
preparedfor all sources and uses of project expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
118.     Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA grant will make use of&#13;
reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments including full&#13;
documentation or against statements o f expenditures, as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
119.     Retroactive Financing.      A provision has been made to reimburse the&#13;
Government for payments from government resources up to a maximum o f US$2 million&#13;
for eligible project expenditures incurredafter April 15, 2007 and up to the signing o f the&#13;
Financing Agreement, in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. In&#13;
particular and given its urgency and priority, this provision i s expected to be utilized to&#13;
facilitate the early mobilization of the consultants on systems development and for the&#13;
RIMU.&#13;
&#13;
120.     Audit of Project Funds. The Auditor General, supportedby the Audit Agent, is&#13;
responsible for auditing the accounts of all IDA-financed projects.        Annual audited&#13;
project financial statements will be submitted within six months o f the close of GOA'S&#13;
fiscal year. The project audit o f 1384 reported ineligible expenditures which are still&#13;
pendingresolution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            v. ACTION PLAN,MONITORINGEVALUATION RESULTS&#13;
                                             AND                  AND&#13;
&#13;
A. Action Plan&#13;
&#13;
121.     The M O F has agreed to establish the RIMU as the vehicle for advising MOF&#13;
management on its action plan for improving overall PFM performance. Staffing of the&#13;
RIMU has begunwith the appointment o f the Director. The remaining national staff of&#13;
the RIMU were due to be appointed before project negotiations. The services of&#13;
international advisors for the RIMU have begun in that terms o f reference and&#13;
qualifications for two key positions have been agreed. Securing these services will be&#13;
arrangedwith the IARCSC under conditions governingthe CSR project. The project will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           40&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be implemented through annual work plans; the plan for the first year will be prepared&#13;
before the project begins.&#13;
&#13;
B. Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
122.    The RIMUwould incorporate the current M&amp;EUinto its structure for the life of&#13;
the PFMR project to assure coherent results-focused project management. The M&amp;EU&#13;
now reports to the Deputy Minister o f Administration and this arrangement would be re-&#13;
instated at the end o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
123.    The M&amp;EU which is staffed by a senior Afghan national consultant has&#13;
conducted one full year monitoring the reform activities assigned to each of the MOF's&#13;
operating departments contained in the MOF Strategic Plan. It has reported findings&#13;
quarterly to the Deputy Minister o f Administration and senior MOF officials. However,&#13;
the Strategic Plan focused mainly on shorter term actions that would correct immediate&#13;
operational deficiencies in the MOF's work. As a result, the M&amp;EU has not had&#13;
experience in monitoring "results" and evaluating longer term outcomes. It has not&#13;
therefore been ina position to recommend re-programming reform activities contained in&#13;
that Strategic Plan.&#13;
&#13;
124.    With the M&amp;EUstaff, the RIMUwould introduce a newmonitoring methodology&#13;
including monitoring the achievement o f annual benchmark results as presented inAnnex&#13;
A, in addition to the more conventional monitoring o f the execution o f activities that are&#13;
agreed inannual work programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          0     Quarterly Activity Reports.      RIMU/M&amp;EU would continue current&#13;
                practices in compiling quarterly activity and input use reports that would&#13;
                also evaluate progress in meeting expected annual results. The audience&#13;
                for these reports would be the RIMUand the PFMR Steering Committee.&#13;
                They would be used essentially for short term management and&#13;
                coordination purposes. They would draw on observations by the M&amp;EU&#13;
                and activity reports by those responsible for implementation of various&#13;
                components and sub-components (as i s the current practice), as well as&#13;
                expenditure and personnel use data. They would estimate the likelihood o f&#13;
                meeting annual results expectations based on these observations. The mid-&#13;
                year report would be compiled so as to coincide with a regular supervision&#13;
                mission o f IDA and other donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          0     Annual Performance Report. During the last quarter o f each project year,&#13;
                intime to influence the preparation ofthe following year's work program,&#13;
                the RIMUwould contract with independent short term consultants to make&#13;
                a more thorough review o f project performance. Their report would be&#13;
                "strategic"   in nature and tone, compiling the updated information&#13;
                previously presented in quarterly activities reports, but focusing on&#13;
                evaluating progress in meeting results benchmarks (for individual&#13;
                components and sub-components) and the project's strategic objectives. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                would make recommendations concerning modification o f activities, and&#13;
                inan extreme case, modificationof expected results. The audience for this&#13;
                report would be the RIMU, the Minister, Deputy Ministers/Treasury, the&#13;
                Project Steering Committee, and donors.&#13;
&#13;
                Annual Performance Review (APR). Based on the consultant's report, the&#13;
                Minister and the RIMU would convene an APR whose objectives would&#13;
                be to: (i)validate the factual findings and agree with or modify their&#13;
                interpretation; and (ii) discuss and agree on modifications to the reform&#13;
                program activities. This would assure that strategic results were going to&#13;
                be achieved and the follow-on annual work program (activities, costs,&#13;
                financing, implementation arrangements) would incorporate these actions.&#13;
                In the second APR, if exogenous events appeared to make original&#13;
                assumptions underlying the project unrealistic, the development objectives&#13;
                o f the project may also be modified. The APR would be timedto meet the&#13;
                GOA budget cycle. Donors would be expected to time their project&#13;
                supervision activities to participate inthe APR.&#13;
&#13;
125.    After approximately 24 months o f project implementation, the RIMU would&#13;
conduct a strategic review o f progress in meeting overall PFMR results (Annex A). As a&#13;
key part o f this review, it would engage short term consultants to assist in updating the&#13;
findings o f the "PEFA Analysis" contained in the 2005 publication "Afghanistan:&#13;
Managing Public Finances for Development." The purpose o f this review would be to&#13;
identify the framework for the preparation of a further 2-3 years of reform in the PFM&#13;
system which might be supported by donors. The audience for this review would be the&#13;
political level o f the GOA, donors, and stakeholders. Donors would participate in this&#13;
review treating it as an "identification" exercise for their further possible support for&#13;
PFM reform.&#13;
&#13;
C. Bank Supervision&#13;
&#13;
126.    Bankmonitoring and evaluationwill bebased on a set o f specific and monitorable&#13;
performance monitoring indicators from the results framework presented in Annex A.&#13;
Specific benchmarks have been outlined for agreement between the government and&#13;
technical assistance providers early on in implementation so as to measure specific&#13;
progress in meeting both the PFM performance and capacity building objectives. The&#13;
project's task team leader will be located in Kabul and conduct continuous supervision.&#13;
Additionally, a full supervision mission will be carried out twice a year comprising&#13;
appropriate specialists from each o f the component areas. This supervision will be&#13;
conducted incoordination with the supervision o f DFID's technical assistance on Budget&#13;
Formulation and Execution. Before the end o f the second year o f project implementation,&#13;
a mid-term review will be conducted in order to assess the advance toward the&#13;
development objectives. The RIMUwill have the primary responsibility to prepare and&#13;
furnish to IDA quarterly project report highlightingprogress in undertaking the actions&#13;
required to achieve project development objectives.&#13;

                       ANNEXC. PROCUREMENTARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
&#13;
1.       The Bankhas gained substantial experience andunderstanding o fthe procurement&#13;
environment in Afghanistan through its involvement in the interim procurement&#13;
arrangements put in place through EPAP as well as with the institutions such as ARDS&#13;
that i s holding the current responsibility for government's procurement administration.&#13;
As part of the broader review of Afghanistan's PFM system, the Bank recently carried&#13;
out an assessment o f the procurement environment in the country based on the baseline&#13;
and performance indicators developed by a group o f institutions led by the World Bank&#13;
and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development/Development Assistance&#13;
Committee.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The first key issue identified through the procurement assessment was the need&#13;
for ownership and a champion in the government for reform, deepening o f capacity,&#13;
ensuring integrity in the operation o f procurement systems, and promoting sound&#13;
procurement among ministries.&#13;
&#13;
3.       A new Procurement Law was adopted in November 2005 which radically&#13;
transforms the legal and regulatory framework for the procurement administration o f&#13;
Afghanistan. While it provides a very modern legal system for procurement, effective&#13;
implementation o f the law may encounter difficulties in the current weak institutional&#13;
structure and capacity o f the government. A PPU has now been established under MOF&#13;
to ensure the implementation through the creation o f secondary legislation, standard&#13;
bidding documents, provision of advice and creation of the necessary information&#13;
systems for advertising and data collection. "Afghanistan Procurement Regulations" has&#13;
been prepared under two sections: (i)    Regulations; and (ii)&#13;
                                                             Procedures and under review&#13;
by the Ministry o f Justice prior to submission to the Cabinet o f Ministers. Procedures for&#13;
procurement appeal and review have been developed by PPU/MOF and the nominated&#13;
memberswill be appointed for the system to be functional by April 2007.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Inthe absence o f adequate capacity to manage procurement activities effectively,&#13;
some interim arrangements have been put in place to improve the procurement&#13;
management o f the country. A central procurement facilitation service, ARDS-PU has&#13;
been established under the supervision o f MOE. The Bank and the government have&#13;
agreed on a program for country-wide procurement reform and capacity buildingleading&#13;
to the transition from centralized to decentralized procurement services.        The Bank&#13;
funded PACB project is the primary instrument for implementing the program to&#13;
strengthencapacity o f the line ministries to manage public procurement in an effective,&#13;
transparent and accountable manner. However, the implementation o f the procurement&#13;
capacity building strategy has not made any significant progress yet due to lack o f&#13;
coordination and delays in decision making within the government.            The envisaged&#13;
radical changes to the procurement management environment expected from the new&#13;
Law also require the urgent implementation o f a comprehensive human resources and&#13;

&#13;
Part B Assessment of the Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement&#13;
        -&#13;
&#13;
14.     The project will be implemented by MOF. An assessment o f the capacity of the&#13;
MOF to implementthe procurement actions under the project was carried out inFebruary&#13;
2007 by Deepal Fernando (Senior Procurement Specialist) and Rahimullah Wardak&#13;
(Procurement Analyst) o f the Afghanistan country office.&#13;
&#13;
15.     The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for the implementation of&#13;
the project andthe capacity o fthe implementingagenciesto handle procurement.&#13;
&#13;
Ministryof Finance&#13;
&#13;
16.    Director General (Administration) o f the MOF i s handlingday-to-day small value&#13;
procurement for the ministry. Therefore, that unit has the capacity to carry out small&#13;
value contracts following shopping and direct contracting procedures with limited&#13;
capacity building. This unit has not handled and does not have the capacity to handle&#13;
large value contracts including selection o f consultants.&#13;
&#13;
Controland Audit Office&#13;
&#13;
17.    The Department of Services reporting to Director General (Finance and&#13;
Administration) i s responsible for all the procurement actions o f the CAO. CAO's office&#13;
does not carry out major procurement activities. Inthe recent past they have purchased a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
few computers and furniture under the development and ordinary budget. They have one&#13;
procurement officer. We can agree to allow the CAO office to procure goods following&#13;
shopping and direct contracting procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Ministry of Economy&#13;
&#13;
18.     The Procurement Unit o f the MOE is handling day-to-day small value&#13;
procurement for the ministry. Therefore that unit will have the capacity to carryout small&#13;
value contracts following shopping procedures with limited capacity building. This unit&#13;
has not handledand does not have the capacity to handle large value contracts including&#13;
selection o f consultants.&#13;
&#13;
19.     The ARDS-PU o f the M O E already has sufficient capacity and experience in&#13;
handlingprocurement. At present, PUprovides procurement services to all the ministries&#13;
under the GOA for all projects funded by the government and donors. There was a&#13;
circular o f MOF which indicates that ARDS-PU should carry out all the procurement&#13;
actions for contracts estimated to cost more than US$200,000. This requirement may be&#13;
waived provided the implementing ministry/agency i s sufficiently equipped with staff or&#13;
procurement consultants capable of carrying out procurement actions. The staff o f&#13;
ARDS-PU is familiar with procurement procedures and guidelines o f the GOA, World&#13;
Bank and other donors. ARDS has a register o f firms and consultants. All the bid&#13;
invitations and Expressions o f Interest are advertised intheir website and the documents&#13;
are issued electronically free o f charge to the registered bidders and the others who wish&#13;
to participate in the biddingprocess. All the awards as per the Law are published in the&#13;
ARDS website on behalfof all the ministrieswho seek their services.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Based on the above assessment, it was agreed that all goods contracts following&#13;
I C B N C B procedures and all consulting assignments with firms and high value&#13;
assignments o f selection o f individual consultants on behalf o f the M O F will be carried&#13;
out by the ARDS-PU under the MOE. The assignment for the selection of a consultant&#13;
for central procurement facilitation will behandledby the administration unit o f the MOF&#13;
with guidance from MOE and PPU of MOF, as it will be a conflict to allow the current&#13;
ARDS-PU to take a lead inthe procurement process.&#13;
&#13;
21,     However in order to mitigate procurement risks, it i s proposed to conduct several&#13;
training programs as indicated below for the staff o f the MOF, CAO, and MOE especially&#13;
drawn from the administration unit and potential evaluation committee members. In&#13;
addition, it i s important that the consultant selected to carryout the capacity building&#13;
activities carry out several programs to create awareness among all the stakeholders o f&#13;
the new Procurement Law and Afghanistan Procurement Regulations and Procedures.&#13;
The proposed capacity buildingprogram is presented insection D1.&#13;
&#13;
The procurement risk at the country levelis consideredas "Average."&#13;

Part C ProcurementPlan&#13;
       -&#13;
&#13;
22.    The Grant recipient, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project&#13;
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has&#13;
been agreed between the Grant recipient and the project team and is available at MOF,&#13;
Pashtunistan Wat, Kabul, Afghanistan. It will also be available in the project's database&#13;
and on the Bank's external website. The procurement plan will be updated inagreement&#13;
with the project team annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project implementation&#13;
needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;

                           ANNEXD. FINANCIALMANAGEMENT&#13;
I.CountryIssues&#13;
&#13;
1.      The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the financial&#13;
management environment in Afghanistan through the large number o f projects under&#13;
implementation over the past four years. The PACB project i s the primary instrument to&#13;
continue and enhance the fiduciary measures put in place during the past years to help&#13;
ensure transparency and accountability for the funding provided by the Bank and other&#13;
donors.&#13;
&#13;
2.      A PFM performance rating system using 28 high-level indicators that was&#13;
developed by the PEFA multi-agency partnership program was applied in Afghanistan in&#13;
June 2005. PEFA i s comprised o f the World Bank, IMF, European Commission, and&#13;
several other agencies. The system i s structured around six core dimensions o f PFM&#13;
performance: (i)  budget credibility; (ii)&#13;
                                        comprehensiveness and transparency; (iii)  policy-&#13;
based budgeting; (iv) predictability and control in budget execution; (v) accounting,&#13;
recording, and reporting; and (vi) external scrutiny and audit.      Afghanistan's ratings&#13;
against the PFM performance indicators generally portray a public sector where financial&#13;
resources are, by and large, being used for their intended purposes. This has been&#13;
accomplished with very high levels o f support from international firms; this assistance&#13;
will continue to be needed over the medium term if these ratings are to be maintained.&#13;
There i s also much room for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
3.      In spite of undeniable gains made in reconstruction since the end of 2001, the&#13;
challenges facing Afghanistan remain immense, not least because of the tenuous security&#13;
situation in the region and continued prevalence o f a large illegal and illicit economy.&#13;
The policy framework benchmarks have not yet beenfully costed so various priorities are&#13;
funded through the annual budgeting process. The rising costs o f the security sector&#13;
constitute the major constraint on attainment o f fiscal sustainability. With regard to&#13;
executive oversight, the national assembly will play an increasingly active role. All in&#13;
all, the new national strategy has created high expectations o f the executive which could&#13;
prove to be quite difficult to meet.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The public sector, in spite o f considerable efforts to reform its core functions,&#13;
remains extremely weak outside o f Kabul. The lack o f qualified staff inthe civil service&#13;
and the absence o f qualified counterparts in the government after 30 years o f war and&#13;
conflicts i s a binding constraint. Delays in reforming the pay structure and grading o f&#13;
civil servants have severely crippled the public administration o f the country. Domestic&#13;
revenues lag behind expenditures by a factor o f ten to one. Large-scale corruption could&#13;
emerge to undermine the government's efforts to enhance aid flows through national&#13;
accounts.    Capacities to track expenditures and monitor expenditure outcomes have&#13;
improved but they need rapid and substantial strengthening if progress toward the&#13;
attainment o f national development targets i s to be monitored. Currently 75% o f external&#13;
revenues bypass government appropriation systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            57&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.       The World Bank is financing a Financial Management Advisor to assist the MOF,&#13;
an Audit Advisor to assist the CAO, and a Procurement Advisor to assist inprocurement-&#13;
related activities. Also an Internal Audit function i s being developed within the MOF&#13;
with World Bank financing. USAID, and earlier the Indian Aid Assistance Program, is&#13;
financing a team o f consultants and advisors to assist the DAB inlocal as well as foreign&#13;
currency operations. The activities carried out under the existing public administration&#13;
projects have helped the government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are&#13;
maintained for public expenditures, including those supported by the Bank and the donor&#13;
community.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Progress has been slower than expected in shifting from operations support&#13;
provided by the three advisors to capacity development and knowledge transfer to the&#13;
civil servants. Given that, it i s expected that the advisors will continue to be required for&#13;
the medium term.       Challenges still remain in attaining the agreed upon fiduciary&#13;
standards and also to further enhance them. And to make matters more complex, the&#13;
regulatory environment inAfghanistan has advanced significantly inthe past three years.&#13;
Unfortunately, even mastery o f basic skills in the early environment does not fully&#13;
qualify the civil servants to work effectively inthe new emerging environment.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       il-&#13;

 111. Strengthsand Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
 Strengths&#13;
&#13;
 8.      The government provides assurance to the Bank and other donors that the&#13;
 measures in place to ensure appropriate utilization o f funds will not be circumvented.&#13;
 The government support for PACB is strength in itself to enhance financial management&#13;
 in Treasury operations, public procurement, internal audit in the public sector, and&#13;
 external audit by the Auditor General. A specific strength i s that this i s a follow-up&#13;
 project, and thus, the agencies involved in the implementation o f each component have&#13;
 experience inimplementing Bank projects and following Bank procedures.&#13;
&#13;
 Weaknesses and Action Plan&#13;
&#13;
 9.      The main weakness inthis project, as inmany others inAfghanistan, is the ability&#13;
 to attract suitably qualified and experienced counterpart staff especially for financial&#13;
 management. The additional staff to be funded by the project, together with intensive&#13;
 training programs included in this project, i s expected to strengthen the fiduciary&#13;
 arrangements.&#13;

 be defined&#13;
&#13;
 V. ImplementingEntity&#13;
&#13;
 10.     The project would be implemented under the authority o f the Minister o f Finance.&#13;
 The Minister would be assisted by the PFM Reform Steering Committee (PFMRSC)&#13;
 comprising senior M O F departmental managers, a representative o f the MOE responsible&#13;
 for procurement administration, and a representative o f the CAO to maintain focus on&#13;
 results, good communications and a consolidated view o f the reform and to discuss and&#13;
 recommend any necessary policy and regulatory improvements.&#13;
&#13;
 11.     The PFMRSC will serve as the oversight body for the project. The committee will&#13;
 convene at least every quarter to review progress with implementation and review and&#13;
 approve work plans and budget.&#13;
&#13;
 12.     Daily operations o fthe project would be managed by a newly formed RIMU. The&#13;
 RIMUwould report to the Minister of Finance on project implementation and will also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             60&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
serve as the "secretariat" for deliberations o f the PFMRSC. The specific role o f the&#13;
RIMU would be to plan, coordinate, monitor and evaluate the implementation of the&#13;
overall PFM reform strategy work program and the achievement o f its intended results.&#13;
This would cover all project-supported activities including those implemented through&#13;
the MOE and the CAO as well as activities financed by other donor partners (for&#13;
example, DFID, supporting the development o f the Budget Department). The RIMU&#13;
would also undertake analyses and recommendations o f key policy issues affecting the&#13;
efficient performance and sustainability o f PFM reforms. It would be responsible for&#13;
planning for and facilitating and obtaining the contributions o f the IARCSC to&#13;
developing the M O F human resources management capabilities so that they are&#13;
consistent with overall civil service management regulations and best practices. Lastly,&#13;
the RIMUwould facilitate establishing and maintaining linkages with line ministries and&#13;
Mustofiats that would be the "clients" instrengthening PFM institutions.&#13;
&#13;
13.    Managers o f the PPU, Treasury, Internal Audit, MOE, and CAO being supported&#13;
through the project (and by other donors) would be responsible for achieving their own&#13;
specifically assigned results, once they had agreed with annual work plans and&#13;
established implicit performance agreements through the PFMRSC. The RIMU would&#13;
monitor these performance agreements.&#13;
&#13;
14.    The Financial Management Specialist to be recruited at RIMU will take&#13;
responsibility for financial management activities o f the project, which will include&#13;
processing o f consultants and suppliers invoices for payments (Le., preparing M-16 forms&#13;
payment orders); maintaining relevant accounting records; preparing required monthly,&#13;
quarterly and annual reports; coordinating with other component implementing entities to&#13;
ensure that adequate financial management requirements are met; liaising with the SDU&#13;
to ensure that the Designated Account i s replenished when due; and respondingto project&#13;
audits.&#13;
&#13;
15.    To ensure that the implementing entities responsible for the other components&#13;
maintain adequate records and preparetechnical and financial reports o f their activities, a&#13;
dedicated manager and an accounts officer will be assigned by the M O E and CAO.&#13;
&#13;
VI. Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
16.    RIMU will coordinate with each component implementing entity for the&#13;
preparation o f annual work plan and the derivation o f annual budget. This would then be&#13;
submitted to the PFMRSC for approval. RIMU shall also coordinate quarterly budget&#13;
reviews to ensure adequate budget discipline and control. It will be responsible for&#13;
ensuring that project expenditures for each fiscal year are captured in the governmental&#13;
development budget o f that fiscal year. The RIMU must get approvals from the&#13;
presidential office and the Parliament and attach them to B27 and Project Coding Sheet&#13;
forms at the time o f requesting yearly allotments for contracts under the project to avoid&#13;
delays inpayment processing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             61&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 VII. FundsFlow&#13;
&#13;
 17.     The standard funds flow mechanism in Afghanistan will be followed in this&#13;
 project. Project funds will be deposited in the Designated Account to be opened and&#13;
 maintained at the DAB. The Designated Account, in keeping with current practices for&#13;
 other projects inAfghanistan, will be operated by the SDU inthe Treasury Department o f&#13;
 the MOF. Requests for payments from the Designated Account will be made to the SDU&#13;
 bythe implementingentity when needed.&#13;
&#13;
 18.     In addition to payments out of DA funds, the implementing entities can also&#13;
 request the SDU to make: (i)    direct payments from the Grant account to consultants or&#13;
 consulting firms; and (ii) special commitments for contracts covered by letters o f credit.&#13;
 These payments will follow World Bank procedures. All project payments will be made&#13;
 to either international firms or local firms that have bank accounts in DAB, a local&#13;
 commercial bank, or an overseas bank. All payments will be made either through bank&#13;
 transfers into the account of such firms or by check. Expenditures for each component&#13;
 will be paid centrally from RIMU in accordance with the approval mechanisms&#13;
 documented inthe project FMManual.&#13;
&#13;
 VII. Retroactive Financing&#13;
&#13;
 19.     A provision has been made to reimbursethe government for payments it makes&#13;
 from government resources up to a maximum o f SDR 1.3 million (US$2 million) for&#13;
 eligible project expenditures incurred after April 15, 2007 and up to the signing o f the&#13;
 Financing Agreement in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.                  In&#13;
 particular, and given its urgency and priority, this provision i s expected to be utilized to&#13;
 facilitate the early mobilization o f the consultants on systems development and for the&#13;
 RIMU.&#13;

Component 1.2 Treasury Systems Development and Roll-out&#13;
                 -&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       The Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan has begun a program o f government&#13;
financial management improvements            which i s   expected to have far-reaching&#13;
consequences for the manner and processes o f financial transactions, recording,&#13;
accounting, and reporting over the next several years. The extent o f these reforms i s&#13;
evolving but includes budget and expenditure reforms and improved accounting,&#13;
financial reporting, and internal controls.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Over the past four years, an integrated financial management system has been&#13;
implemented in the Treasury o f the MOF. The basic objective o f this system was to&#13;
ensure accountability over the government's budget and expenditures including donor&#13;
funds. It was not intended to be a complete integrated management information system&#13;
that would be capable o f serving the needs o f all government managers. It was basically&#13;
a Treasury system. FreeBalance software i s the core application o f the system known as&#13;
the AFMIS.&#13;
&#13;
3.       As the government has moved forward with their reform program, it became&#13;
apparent that AFMIS needed to be enhanced to meet the increased needs o f the Treasury&#13;
staff as well as line ministries and Mustofiats.        Therefore, in this component, the&#13;
consultant will need to acquire the following modules from FreeBalance in order to&#13;
complete the expanded financial management functions in AFMIS - Procurement, Fixed&#13;
Assets, and Accounts Receivable. The vendor for the Budget Preparation module will be&#13;
decided subsequently.&#13;
&#13;
4.       A fully automated off-the-shelf HRMIS for implementation in MOF is also&#13;
considered necessary. At present, MOF uses the Microsoft Access-based payroll system&#13;
known as Verified Payroll Program which includes the Computerized Payroll System.&#13;
Nevertheless, there i s no HR functionality in the system and the support and&#13;
documentation o f in-house systems i s not optimal. The ultimate goal for HRMIS i s to&#13;
direct deposit the net pay o f each employee into his or her bank account and provide the&#13;
critical personnel data for eventual centralization and determination o fpension liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
5.      AFMIS will be the core financial management information system o f the GOA.&#13;
The information contained in AFMIS will provide MOF a foundation for a&#13;
comprehensive management information view related to the country's financial&#13;
resources. Inaddition, AFMIS will provide useful financial information to line ministries&#13;
to enable them to better manage their programs. It will give these ministries the facilities&#13;
to download relevant and authorized data and perform required analyses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             68&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.      To conduct their designated business affairs, line ministries will require the ability&#13;
to enter transactions into AFMIS and to approve such transactions through the Financial&#13;
Controllers (a Treasury staff) located within the line ministries. One objective o f the&#13;
AFMIS roll out i s to have transaction processing andpayment authorization decentralized&#13;
butpayment processing to remain centrally within Treasury and the Mustofiats. This will&#13;
streamline transaction processing and enable Treasury staff to be reassigned from data&#13;
entry to other key Treasury functions. For the purpose o f this Component, the consultant&#13;
will assist the government inrolling out AFMIS to six line ministries and six Mustofiats.&#13;
In addition to rolling out AFMIS to six line ministries, the consultant will assist the&#13;
government in rolling out just the report module o f AFMIS to six additional line&#13;
ministries.&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
7.      The objective o f this contract is for the contractor to assist the government in&#13;
rolling out AFMIS to the six line ministries and six Mustofiats. This roll-out will occur&#13;
after the contractor installs additional modules (Procurement, Fixed Assets and Account&#13;
Receivable, Budget Preparation, and HR) purchased from FreeBalance or from other&#13;
vendors especially for HR and Budget Preparation. In addition, the contractor will roll-&#13;
out just the Reporting Module to six additional line ministries in order to facilitate&#13;
management reporting capabilities and develop the program interfaces for HR and&#13;
Budget modules ifsourced from a vendor other than FreeBalance.&#13;
&#13;
Scope of Services&#13;
&#13;
8.      This consultancy has several distinct but related components:&#13;
&#13;
    e   Roll out the enhanced AFMIS to Treasury.&#13;
    e   Roll out the enhanced AFMIS to the six line ministries and six Mustofiats in a&#13;
        phased approach. Roll out to line ministries i s dependent on having qualified&#13;
        Financial Controllers inplace at the line ministries.&#13;
    e   Enhance the management reporting capability in AFMIS to meet management&#13;
        needs from the system.&#13;
    e   The consultant will needto develop a roll-out plan and schedule for the system for&#13;
        all designated sites. Inaddition, a plan also needs to be developed for rolling out&#13;
        the Reporting Module to the six additional line ministries.&#13;
    e   A checklist needs to be developed detailing tasks that need to be undertaken for&#13;
        roll out o f the system to a typical line ministry and Mustofiat.&#13;
    e   Assist the Treasury in determiningHR functionality to be activated from the new&#13;
        module, train payroll units inthe use and develop the interface with AFMIS.&#13;
    e   The consultant will take the lead inaddressing change management issues within&#13;
        Treasury and the respective ministriesand Mustofiats.&#13;
    e   The consultant shall, in conjunction with MOF personnel, develop and negotiate&#13;
        with line ministries and Mustofiats, appropriate Service Level Agreements for the&#13;
        effective and efficient operation o f AFMIS. These draft agreements shall be&#13;
        developed and signed by the M O F and individual line ministries and Mustofiats&#13;

                    -&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
9.      The CAO i s inthe process o f reforming its organization, methods, and operations.&#13;
Major training efforts are in process to improve the skills o f the audit staff. EPAP and&#13;
PACB assistance has used a professional accounting firm to provide guidance to the&#13;
CAO inthese matters and there is a need for a senior advisor to the Auditor General on a&#13;
full-time basis to manage the processes o f continuing improvement that are needed for&#13;
the CAO to reach a level of performance that no longer needs the routine direct support&#13;
operations o f the contracted firm. A new Audit Law i s inpreparation and the advisor will&#13;
be needed to assist with its implementation.&#13;
&#13;
10.     An advisor has been in place for one year under PACB and has been a valuable&#13;
source o f assistance, supported by the program o f technical assistance included in the&#13;
terms of reference for the supporting audit firm providing direct audit support. The&#13;
PFMR project will concentrate the work o f the audit firm on deliveringaudit services and&#13;
support the strengthening o f the CAO by continuing the provision o f an advisor&#13;
supported by three audit experts available on a full-time basis to work as audit team&#13;
leaders and provide on-the-job training to the CAO and its staff.          This will greatly&#13;
improve the quality o f the audit work, embed the new audit manuals provided, and build&#13;
a competent audit workforce conducting audits that are relevant to the role o f the CAO as&#13;
set out inthe PEFM Law and the draft Audit Law.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Some particular Articles o f the PEFM Law will be directly addressed by the&#13;
advisory services. The advisory services will support Articles 5 and 6 which impose&#13;
obligations on relevant persons for the conduct o f financial affairs by training the auditors&#13;
to assess internal controls and the implementation o f these obligations, and thereby&#13;
support the system o f accountability established by the Law. Article 55 requires a final&#13;
budget reconciliations report and a set of financial statements prepared in accordance&#13;
with International Public Sector Accounting Standards. Revenues, expenditures, assets,&#13;
and liabilities will be reported and audited by the CAO as per Article 59 which requires&#13;
audit certification and public report to the National Assembly within six months o f the&#13;
end o fthe year. The auditing services will enable these certifications and reports to be in&#13;
accordance with InternationalAuditing Standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

standards o f financial management including the use o f internationally recognized&#13;
accounting, auditing, and reporting standards enabled by modern technology and&#13;
software applications.&#13;
&#13;
14.     This contract seeks to consolidate and enhance the capacity o f the CAO to&#13;

&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
38.     Since August 2002, an audit consultancy firm, funded out of EPAP (PKF&#13;
International) and then PACB (Deloitte), has been providing operational support and&#13;
capacity building assistance to the CAO. The scarcity o f qualified accountants and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            76&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
lack o f understanding o f financial statement audits within the CAO have required that the&#13;
firm play a significant role in the conduct of audits. During this period, the CAO has&#13;
completed, with the assistance o f the firm, the audit o f a substantial number o f World&#13;
Bank and ARTF funded projects, and the capacity o f the CAO staff has improved under&#13;
the on-the-job training supplied by the firm during the audits. These steps have been&#13;
successful in re-establishing the CAO as a working institution capable o f absorbing&#13;
institutional strengthening assistance, but it has not developed the institution and its staff&#13;
sufficiently for them to conduct financial statement audits to international standards&#13;
without continuing professionalassistance.&#13;
&#13;
39.     The firm also prepared draft human resources assessment covering training needs,&#13;
training strategy, HR management, and a staff qualifications inventory. A range o f formal&#13;
training activities including training in English, computer literacy, and basic accounting,&#13;
and informal on-the-job training through the conduct o f audits have been conducted with&#13;
more than 100 CAO staff taking part. Inaddition, an audit law has been drafted as well as&#13;
a draft strategic plan prepared for the CAO with an audit manual yet to be completed.&#13;
Mid-term reviews o f progress on these issues indicated a need for more direct, full-time&#13;
concentration on implementation and further progression o f these activities inthis project&#13;
i s to be undertaken by an audit advisor and some audit experts recruited full-time to&#13;
support the CAO under the Advisory Services sub-component o f this project. This will&#13;
enable the audit firm to concentrate on the audit and on-the-job training work.&#13;
&#13;
40.      The goals o f the government include maintaining appropriate fiduciary standards&#13;
to provide reasonable assurance to the Afghan public and to international donors that&#13;
government resources and donor funds are subject to appropriate allocation and&#13;
expenditure controls. An important objective i s achieving compliance with international&#13;
standards o f financial management including the use o f the International Standards o f&#13;
Auditing. The firm has largely been excluded in practice from assisting the CAO with&#13;
auditing the government's financial statements. The passage o f the PEFM Law&#13;
necessitates that the CAO make greater use o f the firm in these audits during the period&#13;
o f the PFMR project as well as for the ARTF and the Grant audits to conduct them in&#13;
accordance with international standards.&#13;
&#13;
Contractor Terms of Reference&#13;
&#13;
41.      The specific purpose o f this consultancy i s providing the direct operations support&#13;
to the CAO inconducting all o f its certification audits.&#13;
&#13;
Support to Audit Operations&#13;
&#13;
42.      Assistance to be provided under this consultancy for audit operations will focus&#13;
on direct, technical audit support and informal on-the-job training to the CAO teams&#13;
undertaking audits o f the SY1386, 1387, and 1388 financial statements for the ARTF, the&#13;
government's annual accounts, and selected World Bank projects. Additionally, the&#13;
project will provide assistance for the audit o f the UNDP Nationally Executed&#13;
Expenditure (NEX) projects. As a guideline, approximately 30 World Bank project audits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              77&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
are expected to be undertaken for each solar year. It i s estimated that about 20 person&#13;
months of experienced and qualified consultancy services will be required to provide&#13;
support and on-the-job training during the annual audit season to about 240 person&#13;
months o f CAO audit staff.&#13;
&#13;
43.     The on-the-job training provided during actual audit o f accounts is regarded as a&#13;
key part o f the capacity building being provided to CAO staff through knowledge&#13;
transfer. The training during the period i s to become more formalized with the intention&#13;
o f accrediting CAO staff with competencies inthe various elements of audit work as laid&#13;
out inthe International Federationo f Accountants Competency Standards for Auditors.&#13;
&#13;
44.     Additionally, the government i s looking in this round o f contracts to contribute to&#13;
buildthe skills for the Afghanistanpublic sector by two means: (i)   on-the-job training for&#13;
civil servants who will be acquiring basic knowledge under the HR development&#13;
component o f this project with the direct operations consultant firms, and (ii)includingin&#13;
the technical assistance teams underthe direct operations support contracts a larger share&#13;
o f local advisors with concrete deliverables for the transfer o f knowledge and skills for&#13;
the operation of the PFM systems. The contractor will put more emphasis than in the&#13;
past on using local advisors and transferring a requisite minimum level o f skills to these&#13;
to conduct independently audit field work.&#13;
&#13;

CAO staff participating inthe on-the-job work experience program afforded by the above&#13;
audits ineight competency skills.&#13;

government loans and grants to international standards within the period o f the contract&#13;
with agreedmilestones.&#13;
