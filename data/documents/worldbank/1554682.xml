ABSTRACT&#13;
1,        This paper analyzes the contributions made by IDA-financed technical&#13;
assistants to institutional development in macro-economic policy formulation&#13;
in Togo during 1983-85.   The Government's comprehensive policy response to a&#13;
deteriorating economic End financial situation is presented with emphasis on&#13;
the role of technical assistance.    The performance of the resident technical&#13;
assistants financed by IDA is reviewed. Inistitutional development has overall&#13;
been limited because technical assistants have been absorbed by current&#13;
operational tasks.&#13;
2.        On the basis of the mixed experLence so far, the paper goes on to&#13;
make recommendaitions to improve the contribution of tecbnical assistance to&#13;
institutional   developmenit  in  macro-ecortomic  policy  formulation.   Clear&#13;
objectives and a receptive framework are cited as kLey factors.       Different&#13;
instruments are needed depending on whether technical assistance is aimed at&#13;
performance of tasks, facilitation of processes or promotion of institutional&#13;
development.&#13;

I. INmURiJCrION&#13;
1. The objective of this paper is to describe and analyze the&#13;
experienc,e gained in Togo in using technical assistance as an&#13;
instrument to promote mncro!-economic policy formulation. In this&#13;
particular case, the experience was gained in conjunction with a&#13;
First Structural Adjustment Program.It is the position of this paper&#13;
that, in addition to promoting policy formulation on specific issues,&#13;
technical assistance is a potentially valuable instrument for&#13;
enhancing over time the policy formulation process in general. In&#13;
other words, technical assistance can aid the developnent of an&#13;
institutional capacity to formulate and execute a series of&#13;
macro-economic policies. The argurent is that institutional&#13;
developnent in the area of macromeconomic policy formulation and&#13;
management can, under propitious circumstances, foster an&#13;
"internalization" of improved analytical capabilities and economic&#13;
management techniques. Internalization denotes in this paper an&#13;
increased national capability for analysis and economic management on&#13;
a sustainable basis without recourse to outside technical assistance.&#13;

2. Through the process of internalization, technical assistance can&#13;
make a lasting and fundamental contribution to national capabilities,&#13;
because the improvements realized in policy analysis and economic&#13;
management will have beccme an integral part of the administrative&#13;
structure of the country receiving this kind of technical assistance.&#13;
The improvements in policy analysis and econcmic management will&#13;
become sustainable due to internalization, and a lasting feature of&#13;
the country's kit of tools in dealing with econanic issues even after&#13;
the withdrawal of technical assistance. If new skills have been&#13;
durably imparted, then the technical assistance would indeed have led&#13;
to a transfer of skills. It could thereby have rendered itself&#13;
superfluous, and could be withdrawn without any weakening of country&#13;
capabilities. Not only would the country be better equipped to deal&#13;
with its current problems, but it would also be better equipped to&#13;
deal with future problems and opportunities that will undoubtedly&#13;
arise again and again. The country would be in a much stronger&#13;
posture to pursue an accelerated development through a wide diversity&#13;
of circumstances.&#13;
3. In the particular case of Togo, this paper examines the relevant&#13;
issues in macroeeconamic institutional development and the various&#13;
forms of technical assistance that were designed to deal with the&#13;
critical issues. The lessons learned fram the experience to date will&#13;
be presented and assessed with a view to producing recanmendations&#13;
for improving the hitherto limited contribution of technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

assistance that mrere designed to deal with the critical issues. The&#13;
lessons learned from the experience to date will be presented and&#13;
assessed with a view to producing recaomendations for improving the&#13;
hitherto limited contribution of technical assistance to policy and&#13;
institutional reform. The report is meant to be action oriented. It&#13;
is intendled to make a contribution, albeit a modest one, to the&#13;
design of future Banknfinanced technical assistance projects aimed at&#13;
promoting macroteconomic policy fornmulation and institutional&#13;
developnent.&#13;
4. The focus of the paper is on Togo's experience with IDIA&#13;
supported technical assistance and structurai adjustment during&#13;
1983-85, though onie must realize that the country's serious econoxnic&#13;
and financial problems originated at least as far back as 1974. The&#13;
Bank lending instruments used were the First and Second Technical&#13;
Assistance Projects (Credits 93OP-10 and 127OP-710) and the First&#13;
Structural Adjustnent Program (Credit 1365-10).&#13;
5. Ihe structure of the paper is: to present first the key background&#13;
economic and financial developments during 1974,85 with an emphasis&#13;
on the 1983n85 camprehensive reform package and  the goverrment of&#13;
Togo's econmnic policy capabilities; second, the role of technical&#13;
assistance in macroeconomic policy formulation; third, an assessment&#13;
of the iimpact of technical assistance on institutional developnent;&#13;
fourth, reccmmendations for the future; and finally, sone conclusions&#13;
of broad, applicability.&#13;

IH. ECOMU4IC PERRFMkNE AND MANIEMENr ,1974,85&#13;
A. The 1974 Phosphate Bocm and Its Consequences&#13;
6. Togo's econcmic developnent was steady and rapid between 1960 and&#13;
1973, but was jolted in 1974 by the sudden boom in world market&#13;
prices of phosphate rock, Togo's largest single export cammodity.&#13;
Between 1960 and 1973, real CDP had grown at an annual average of 7&#13;
percent and had been acccrmpanied by sustainable overall budget and&#13;
balance of payments deficits. From 1974, growth became erratic and&#13;
ultimately slowed markedly under the impact of widening budget and&#13;
balance of payments deficits.&#13;
7. The temporary rise in phosphate prices fron $14 a ton to over $60&#13;
a ton in 1974/75 led to nearly a doubling of government revenue in&#13;
1975. The Government had fortuitously and for political reasons&#13;
nationalized the phosphate mine in&#13;
early 1974, just before the start of the boom. The sudden and&#13;
precipitous rise in revenue made the Government abandon its&#13;
previously prudent policies. A decision was taken to enlarge the role&#13;
of the state in the economy through the creation of numerous state&#13;
enterprises in industry and services. Togo was to make a great leap&#13;
forward toward a modern economy characterized by large capital&#13;
intensive state enterprises. These were intended to serve as growth&#13;
poles for the rest of the econamy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5.-&#13;
8. With the rush to invest in state enterprises, the investment to&#13;
GDP ratio rose sharply to 46 percent in 1978. Growth in real GOP&#13;
neverthel,ess slowed to an annual average of 4.3 percent during&#13;
1975-78, in large part because of drought induced sluggish' growth in&#13;
agriculture. The expansionary policies adopted by the Government in&#13;
this period might have been successful had the financing of&#13;
investment been sustainable and had viable projects been chosen and&#13;
implemented. Neither was the case. Balieving that the collapse in the&#13;
phosphate boam in late 1975 was only temporary, the Government&#13;
persisted with its expansionary investment program by borrowing&#13;
extensively abroad, increasingly on cammercial terms. In line with&#13;
developments throughout Africa, there was in this period a&#13;
substantial expansion in the Togolese public enterprise sector.&#13;
Investments in this sector absorbed the bulk of the borrowed capital.&#13;
The state enterprises thus financed (a steel mill, an oil refinery,&#13;
luxury hotels etc.) soon turned out to be unable to cover their&#13;
operating costs, l,et alone defray their debt service obligations. The&#13;
Treasury consequently had to assume *their debt service, because their&#13;
foreign borrowing had been guaranteed by the state.&#13;
9. By late 1978 an impasse had been reached. The Treasury was unable&#13;
to honor all debt service payments (equivalent to 34 percent of&#13;
merchandise exports). The difficulty was conpounded by the fact that&#13;
current expenditure, especially for personnel, had also increased&#13;
rapidly. The budget deficit had becone unsustainable and arrears were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
rising. A reversal in policy had became necessary: fran excessive&#13;
expansion to consolidation to cope with the burgeoning financial&#13;
crisis.&#13;
B.  Initial Government Policy Response to the Crisis, 1979F82.&#13;
10. The seriousness of the crisis confronting Togo dawned slowly on&#13;
the Government. Its initial policy response was consequently&#13;
halfFhearted and piecemeal. The groping for ad hoc solutions (that&#13;
were seldom no more than temporary palliatives) during 1979-82&#13;
resulted  in lost time and ultinately aggravated the crisis. An&#13;
illustration of this ad hoc approach was the large budget transfers&#13;
the phosphate ccmpany had to make in 1980 to meet Treasury debt&#13;
service obligations. The phosphate company could mlake these transfers&#13;
only by incurring sizeable shortitenm bank debt, thereby imperilling&#13;
its own financial situation. In 1981 the phosphate company decided to&#13;
pay off its costly bank debt, but had thereby to reduce its budget&#13;
transfers. As a result, the Treasury became starved for resources,&#13;
arrears began to climb anew, and the financial stabilization program&#13;
negotiated with the IMF foundered.&#13;
11. The Govermient remained blissfully convinced that the crisis was&#13;
cyclical and not structural, and that with a bit of luck and&#13;
perseverance most of the problens would go away without the adoption&#13;
of painful and cofprehensive adjustment measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
12. The first goverrnment step tcwarcl adjusting the overheated&#13;
econany Wms simply to let the investment spurt run out of steam. Few&#13;
new projects were begun. As ongoing projects were completed, total&#13;
investment slumped, first slowly in 1.979, and then rapidly in&#13;
1980-82. The sharp drop in investment, and the spreading retrenching&#13;
in the putblic sector sapped any further (DP growth. This resulted in&#13;
GDP stagnating between 1979 and 1982.&#13;
13. Ihe forgoing of growth and developrent in those years was&#13;
unfortunately not acccznpanied by a corresponding improvemnent in the&#13;
financial situation. In part this was because of an adverse external&#13;
envirorinent, but in part because of the lack of any coherent&#13;
financial strategy. An IMF standby in 1979e80, accompanied by debt&#13;
reschedulings through the Paris and London Clubs, turned out to be&#13;
little more than holding operations. A second IMF standby for 1981&#13;
foundered because of disagreements on fiscal policy and the financial&#13;
management of the phosphate campany in the context of the financial&#13;
stabilization program accampanying the standby, which consequently&#13;
was abandoned halfwway through. Relations between the IMF and Togo&#13;
became strained and prevented agreement on a standby for 1982.&#13;
Consequently no debt rescheduling was obtained for 1982 and indeed&#13;
not much debt was paid by Togo during that year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
14. By the end of 1982 the severity of the economnic and financial&#13;
crisis had became clear even to the most recalcitrant members of the&#13;
Government. The economy was in a prolonged deep recession that no&#13;
longer could be dismissed as cyclical. The financial situation had&#13;
deteriorated to the point of beccming unmanageable. By the end of&#13;
1982 external arrears amounted to CIAF 58 billion ($177 million),&#13;
while debt service payments for 1983 (before any possible debt&#13;
rescheduling) amounted to CFAF 53 billion ($161 million). With&#13;
government revenue projected to reach CEAF 82 billion ($250 million),&#13;
total debt payments formally due corresponded to 135 percent of&#13;
government revenue. Something had to give and soon.&#13;
C. Strategic Government Policy Response to the Crisis, 1983-85&#13;
15. By late 1982, the Government had finally become convinced that it&#13;
was faced with a structural crisis and that far-reaching adjustment&#13;
measures were required as part of a coherent multi-pronged strategy.&#13;
Action was sparked by a strong personal commitment from the Head of&#13;
State, whose patience with the suppurating debt crisis had run out.&#13;
Togolese authorities began to contemplate financial austerity&#13;
measures to re,establish creditworthiness and econcmic adjustment&#13;
measures to overcome the recession. However, willingness is one&#13;
thing, ability another. The Government had never before attempted&#13;
anything even remotely similar and its analytical and managerial&#13;
capacities would be heavily taxed during the elaboration and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
implementation of a ccmprehensive recovery program. It is likely that&#13;
few within, or for that matter outside the Government, realized how&#13;
extensive, if not radical, a process wvas about to be set in motion.&#13;
16. Following a resumption of better relations with the IMF, (partly&#13;
out of sheer necessity, but also out of a genuine willingness to come&#13;
to grips with the debt crisis), Togo negotiated in 1983 a standby&#13;
with remarkably tough conditionality. The standby reopened the door&#13;
to a debt rescheduling with the Paris Club. In parallel, and bulilding&#13;
on a gradually intensifying policy dialogue with the Bank, Togo&#13;
negotiated a (first) Structural Adjustment Program with the Bank. The&#13;
accanpanyirLg Structural Adjustment Credit of $40 million was&#13;
certainly a big inducement given Togo's dire financial straits, but&#13;
there were also several encouraging signs that Togo was on its own&#13;
volition ccmnitted to econanic policy reforms and adjustment. About a&#13;
quarter&#13;
of the measures in the Structural Adjustment Prograrn were included&#13;
at the requiest of the Goverrment.&#13;
17. The programs with the IMF and the Bank were camplementary and&#13;
mutually reinforcing. The thrust of the programns toward budget&#13;
austerity, a tight rronetary policy, iamproved public investment&#13;
programning and state enterprise rehabilitation (including&#13;
liquidatioris) constituted a solid starting point for turning around&#13;
the econonic and financial situation and represented a vast&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
improvement over the previously pursued fragmented and half-hearted&#13;
recovery measures. But the Govermnent was to a large extent only on&#13;
the receiving end of advice during the preparation of the IMF and&#13;
Bank programs, and this despite increasing reliance on technical&#13;
assistance (see section III below). the Government did not possess&#13;
the technical, analytical and managerial capacities required to&#13;
participate fully as an equal partner with the DIF and the Bank in&#13;
the elaboration of these programs. The resulting programs were thus&#13;
mainly Bank and RFnd products.&#13;
18. In orthodox financial terms, the financial stabilization policies&#13;
pursued under the auspices of three successive standbys with the IMF&#13;
during 1983-85 have been a success. Public finances have improved&#13;
significantly as witnessed by a decrease in the ratio of the&#13;
consolidated government deficit (including grants) to (DP fran 6.9&#13;
percent in 1982 to 2.2 percent in 1984. The ratio of consolidated&#13;
government savings to (DP rose from 4.0 percent to 9.3 percent during&#13;
the same period. The improved savings perfonmance resulted fran a&#13;
modest increase in revenue in canbination with a virtual freeze on&#13;
current expenditure in naninal terms.&#13;
19. Most of the increase in public savings was used to pay external&#13;
debt. Capital expenditure was barely maintained in real terns.&#13;
Increased resources generated or freed up for debt service showed up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
in a significant inprovement in debt service performance. External&#13;
payments arrears, which had amounted to CFAF 58 billion ($177&#13;
million) at yeartend 1982 were practically eliminated by year.end&#13;
1983, either through consolidation (CFAF 45 billion), or cash&#13;
payments (CFA F 13 billion). The balance of payrents strengthened as&#13;
reflected in a decline in the ratio of the current account deficit&#13;
(including grants) to CDP from 11.7 percent in 1982 to 4.9 percent in&#13;
1984.&#13;
20. 'he austerity measures adopted in the pursuit of these&#13;
stabilization policies have however exacted an increasing toll in&#13;
terms of baltitightening and declining living standards. Social&#13;
conditions are deteriorating, as witniessed by a drop in the primary&#13;
school enrollment ratio. It is possible to argue that by the end of&#13;
1985 fiscal stringency will have run mnost of its course; one could&#13;
argue further that less contractionary policies are now or soon will&#13;
be called for.&#13;
21. 'he budget went through a wringer in 1983-85. Current expenditure&#13;
on personnel and materials, as well as investrent expenditure were&#13;
all severly curtailed to free up resources for debt service. Efforts&#13;
to increase revenue have produced meager results in light of the&#13;
depressed state of the econony. Wages in both the public and private&#13;
sectors were slashed by 5 percent in nrminal terms at the end of 1982&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
through the imposition of a national solidarity tax (still in effect&#13;
in 1985). A salary and recruitment freeze has effectively been&#13;
maintained since 1982. During the following three years, salaries in&#13;
the public sector have declined by at least 20 percent in real terms.&#13;
Expenditure on materials and maintenance have been curtailed to the&#13;
extent that the administration is hampered by a shortage of supplies&#13;
with which to work, while its physical assets are deteriorating for&#13;
want of adequate maintenance. The decline in investment expenditure&#13;
might be justified since the pipeline of well prepared and productive&#13;
projects was thin. The relative pause in public investment has also&#13;
permitted time to be devoted to a major improvement in investment&#13;
programing (see section IV below).&#13;
22. The ccmprehensive fiscal austerity policies pursued since 1983&#13;
have enabled Togo to corm a long way toward a resolution of its&#13;
foreign debt crisis. It would be premature to claim that the crisis&#13;
is altogether resolved, but the worst is over. If Togo continues&#13;
steadfastly its efforts to overccme its foreign debt problems, the&#13;
crisis should be comTpletely past by the late 1980s. Debt rescheduling&#13;
was obtained through the Paris Club in each successive year from&#13;
1983 to 85. Rescheduled debt was paid on time (with insignificant&#13;
exceptions), and Togo's creditworthiness has begun to recover. There&#13;
is still a need for debt rescheduling in 1986, and possibly beyond,&#13;
but the amount needed to be rescheduled to avoid a financing gap has&#13;
come down fran CFAF 33 billion in 1983 to CFAF 24 billion in 1984 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
CFAF 15 billion in 1985. It is worthwhile noting that during 1983F84&#13;
the Togolese Treasury also paid off mre than CFAF 13 billion in&#13;
external arrears as vwell as more than CFAF 12 billion in internal&#13;
arrears. By early 1985 only a small amount of daoestic arrears&#13;
remained to be paid off. This impressive debt service performance was&#13;
facilitated by financial assistance frcm the Bank, the IAMF and the&#13;
French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique, but would&#13;
nonetheless not have been possible had Togo not resolutely pursued an&#13;
austere fiscal policy during 1983-85.&#13;
23. The improvement in the financial situation has unfortunately not&#13;
been acccmpanied by a corresponding improvement in the econounic&#13;
situation. In real terms GDP has continued to stagnate during&#13;
1983-85. The impact of bountiful harvests has been offset by a&#13;
decline in external conmerce following the closure by Nigeria of its&#13;
borders. Manufacturing is stagnant, and public services are receding.&#13;
The sanitization of the public enterprise sector is advancing, but&#13;
has so far mainly been in the fornn of closure and liquidation of&#13;
small unviable entities, rather than improved performance in the&#13;
largest money'-losers. Government policy makers are now (1985)&#13;
confronted with the challenge of how to stimulate economic activity&#13;
after a long and painful recession without endangering the still&#13;
fragile financial situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
D.  The First Structural Adjustment Program, 1983e84&#13;
24. The Government's First Structural Adjustment Program negotiated&#13;
with the Bank in early 1983 reflected the parlous state of public&#13;
finances at that time. The program emphasized the adoption of&#13;
procedures to improve public resource management while awaiting an&#13;
improvement in the financial situation before econanic activity could&#13;
be rekindled. It was a program designed to lay the foundation for&#13;
more rapid sustained growth compatible with balancerofmpayments&#13;
constraints, at a later stage rather than to opt immediately for such&#13;
growth. The ensuing retrenchnent period was to be temporary and to&#13;
be used to create new strategies for key sectors, in particular rural&#13;
development (where a large untapped growth potential existed), and&#13;
state enterprises (where there was a patent need for improved&#13;
performance).&#13;
25. The objectives of the First Structural Adjustment Program can be&#13;
summarized as :&#13;
i) Improving the management of public resources in general;&#13;
ii) Redefining the respective roles of the public and&#13;
private sectors;&#13;
iii) Improving public investment programning;&#13;
iv) Restructuring the public enterprise sector;&#13;
v) Pranoting rural development;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
vi)  Pramoting private investment through the development&#13;
of SWEs; and&#13;
vii) Promoting mining and energy production.&#13;
During the implementation of the program, significant progress was&#13;
made toward the attainment of these rather general objectives.(1) A&#13;
companion technical assistance project (discussed in section III&#13;
below) was explicitly designed to facilitate program implementation&#13;
in critical areas. Progress was assessed more in terms of concrete&#13;
steps being taken in. accordance with the program, than in terms of&#13;
broader policies being elaborated and adopted. A new rural&#13;
development strategy was indeed adopted, but was couched in such&#13;
general terms that substantial additional work will be required to&#13;
render the strategy operational. Progress in terms of institutional&#13;
reform was even more limited.&#13;
26. Although the direction of change was consistently in line with&#13;
what was sought under-the program, the pace of change was much&#13;
slower than expected,. The program was far too optimistic regarding&#13;
the Government's capacity to pursue adjustment measures and reform&#13;
policies simultaneouLsly and on several fronts. Because of serious&#13;
capacity constraints, the Government tended instead to proceed&#13;
linearly, switching its limited resources back and forth among&#13;
various issues. This inevitably led to long delays.&#13;
(1)  See the President's Report on the Second Structural Adjustment&#13;
Program for Togo (Report N' P*4064 To of May 01, 1985) for a more&#13;
detailed assessment of the implementation of the first program, as&#13;
well as a presentation of the objectives of the follow up second&#13;
program,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
27. The difficulties of gearing up a creaking administrative&#13;
machinery to take on new and more demanding tasks, while real&#13;
salaries were falling, were greatly underestimated. It is not certain&#13;
that the momentun toward reform will persist without continuing&#13;
external impulsion. The Togolese bureaucracy'(or perhaps any&#13;
bureaucracy) has an uncanny capacity for absorbing outside pressures,&#13;
such as those provoked by a crisis, and then to bounce back to the&#13;
status quo ex ante once the pressures have eased. This renders the&#13;
bureaucracy not very permeable to the internalization of new ways of&#13;
doing business. Recognizing the need for institutional development if&#13;
the barely begun policy reform process is to continue, the Second&#13;
Structural Adjustment Program assigns great importance to&#13;
institutional reform.&#13;
E. Government Economic Policy Capabilities&#13;
28. The Togolese Government was presented with an unprecedented&#13;
challenge when the financial and economic crisis erupted in 1978, and&#13;
intensified through late 1982. Gone was the euphoria of the&#13;
short-lived phosphate boom in 1974-75 when possibilities had appeared&#13;
endless. Gone was the slow and steady pace of govermment operations&#13;
during the halcyon years before 1974. In 1978 the Government was&#13;
caught napping. It responded belatedly and ineffectively to the&#13;
crisis. The Government delayed forceful remedial action until late&#13;
1982, when it had no other alternative course of action if bankruptcy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
were to be averted. Apart from a perhaps understandable reluctance to&#13;
face up to the harsh reality, the (lovrerrnent's handling of the crisis&#13;
was greatly aggravated by its inherenitly weak capacity to formulate&#13;
and execute remedial economic policies.&#13;
For instance, the financial situatiorn of the whole state enterprise&#13;
sector was allowed to deteriorate for years on row without remedial&#13;
action being taken (in a sense ihe problem was neglected until it&#13;
became too large to be kept hidden or wished away).&#13;
29. The avrailability of only fragmentary data were rarely up4to-date&#13;
and even more rarely analyzed for pol.icy implications, that made the&#13;
Governement slow to realize the scope and severity of the emerging&#13;
crisis. There was no early warning system in place.&#13;
Compartmentalization and a great reluctance to pass bad news up the&#13;
ladder in a highly centralized hierarchy further impeded the&#13;
Governmenl:s recognition of the crisis and the adoption of corrective&#13;
action. In sun, the Government machinery was simply not geared up to&#13;
assune the new and demanding task of formulating and executing&#13;
remedial economic policies. Routine administration was its long&#13;
established relatiIve forte, but tradiitional practices had little to&#13;
do with economic policy formulation and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
30. Relying on an early warning system and by analyzing data in a&#13;
consistent fashion for policy implications (and without inhibitions&#13;
about unpleasant implications), would have placed the Government in a&#13;
much better position to deal with the crisis early on, before it had&#13;
reached alarning proportions that necessitated drastic corrective&#13;
actions. This would have enabled the Goverrment to cope early with&#13;
the spreading financial failures in the state enterprise sector and&#13;
to anticipate the implications of these failures for budget and debt&#13;
management policies. An earlier awareness of the problems looming&#13;
ahead would probably also have induced the Government to seek&#13;
assistance from the Bank and the IMF before the situation had gotten&#13;
out of hand and Togo's creditworthiness had become badly tainted. For&#13;
too long, the Government listened to the luring arguments of foreign&#13;
suppliers and cammercial bankers to the detriment of a policy&#13;
dialogue with the Bank and the IMF.&#13;
31. A consistent and timely policy response to the deepening crisis&#13;
was impeded by the fragmentation of information and decisionsmaking,&#13;
leading in turn to poor public 3ector resource management. All major&#13;
decisions, be they political or economic, are concentrated at the&#13;
political summit, but many other decisions are taken in a incoherent,&#13;
haphazard manner throughout the administration. Furthermre, the&#13;
information base on which topnlevel political decisions are made&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19--&#13;
appears (fraim indirect evidence) to be fragmented and not always&#13;
consistent,. Sudden and inconsistent decisions are not unheard of. The&#13;
fragmentation of information makes it very difficult for any person&#13;
in the Government to gain a complete overview of what is happening,&#13;
of what the issues are, and how they can or should be dealt with. Add&#13;
to this a sometimes fragmented and at other times excessively&#13;
centralized decisioin-aking process, and it   is not hard to see why&#13;
the Goveriment has such difficulties to undertake comprehensive&#13;
actions as a unified body.&#13;
32. A preoccupation with routine adminiistrative matters such as tax&#13;
collection, payroll preparation and perfunctory control of&#13;
administraltive expenlditures, has not rendered the administration&#13;
prone to pJLanning and anticipatory action, much less the seizing of&#13;
opportunities, which is the essence of economic management. What&#13;
planning has taken place has largely been in a formal or abstract&#13;
sense, and rarely linked to what has actually to be done to make what&#13;
is planned materialiize. Planning degenerated into a theoretical&#13;
exercise devoid of operational content. NMuch operational work was&#13;
done on a dayestomday routine basis. As a consequence, myopia was&#13;
pervasive (as was compartmentalization). When the crisis hit, the&#13;
established tendency to focus on daily or nearaterm matters was&#13;
greatly reinforced. Such was the onslaught of burning daily matters,&#13;
that very little time was available to think about the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
33. Not only were the institutions responsible for economic and&#13;
financial matters (such as ministries of planning, finance and rural&#13;
development and the debt management office) uncoordinated, but they&#13;
were also weak. Their capacity to analyze economic policy issues and&#13;
to prescribe alternative and feasible policy responses was severly&#13;
circumscribed, quite apart from any lack of practice in undertaking&#13;
such work. Human resources were scarce or absent in-key policy areas,&#13;
such as developnent planning, macro economic management, project&#13;
preparation and monitoring. Worse still was the poor use often made&#13;
of existing human resources. Young, inexperienced staff but often&#13;
with solid albeit somewhat theoretical training were rarely used in a&#13;
manner that enabled these young turks to apply what they had learned&#13;
during their formal education and to complement this education with&#13;
practical experience. Instead, scarce skills acquired through long&#13;
and costly education were often allowed to wither away for lack of&#13;
application opportunities. The recourse to technical assistance to&#13;
supplement and train national talents remained limited. The civil&#13;
service expanded from 23,000 in 1975 to 38,000 in 1978,&#13;
disproportionately at the higher levels. Unfortunately there was not&#13;
a corresponding increase in the volume and quality of the output of&#13;
the civil service. Despite the recruitment freeze since 1982, most&#13;
ministries still have excess staff. Average productivity is low. So&#13;
is motivation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-.&#13;
34. 'There is, finally, an eminently political factor that influences&#13;
the Government's economic policy capabilities. The Head of State&#13;
prefers to follcvi personally all major issues and to be responsible&#13;
himself f'or major decisions. As a cons.equence, he is widely seen as&#13;
being in charge arnd as being the source of state munificence&#13;
dispensed conspicuously to various pivotal interest groups. Togo is a&#13;
vivid illustration of personalized patronage politics. One&#13;
consequence of this system is that economic considerations become a&#13;
second priority; first priority is granted to short.term political&#13;
considerations, of'ten in what seems a disconcertingly erratic manner.&#13;
In such circumstances, the incentives to enhance the Government's&#13;
economic policy capabilities tend to be undermined, no matter what&#13;
the prevailing economic situation calls for.&#13;
35. In many developing countries the trade-off between economic&#13;
rationality and political imperatives is often acute. There is less&#13;
margin of maneuver, in terms of availability of resources, to satisfy&#13;
simultaneously divergent objectives. Short-term political survival is&#13;
often an overriding concern in fragile, heterogeneous states with at&#13;
best a short tradition of nationhood to fall back on. Political&#13;
imperatives are pushed to the fore and economic rationality is&#13;
sacrificed, sometimes even in reasonably full awareness of&#13;
longerterm opportunities thereby foregone. 'To stay in power the&#13;
state has to build visible support by all means at hand (and they are&#13;
often not that numerous), because no government, no matter how&#13;
repressive, can rely on force alone. This imperative can be labelled&#13;
the "support imperative". But to meet the exigencies of the support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
imperative, the state needs resources, and indeed most governments in&#13;
developing countries are under pressure to raise more revenue; this&#13;
phenaoenon can be labelled the "revenue imperative". A government&#13;
subject to the revenue an support imperatives will consistently try&#13;
to allocate scarce resources in a manner that enhances its power&#13;
base. Political mileage can effectively be gained by distributing&#13;
conspicuously state munificence to pivotal interest groups.&#13;
Supporters, actual or potential, are to be included, while opponents,&#13;
actual or imaginary, are to be excluded. Reliance on impersonal&#13;
market forces has very l-ittle to do with such an approach. The&#13;
visible hand of state patronage is preferred to the invisible hand of&#13;
market forces. (1)&#13;

IIIl.    ECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN MA(IU-ECOtOvIIC ]OLICY KEIvIJATION&#13;
A. The Need&#13;
36. As in other Sub-Saharan African countries, after its independence&#13;
in 1960, Togo was confronted with a series of new tasks.&#13;
Macro-economic policy formulation and general economic management&#13;
were the major challenges. The legacy of the French colonial&#13;
administration was poor in this area. Until 1960, Togo was perceived&#13;
by the colonial power merely as a supplier of raw materials. Exports&#13;
were ess,entially an enclave activity that were not integrated with&#13;
overall econonic policy. Hardly any macroneconomic concepts were&#13;
developed and applied. The institutions established by the former&#13;
colonial power to deal with economic matters were essentially&#13;
oriented toward administrative and fiscal matters rather than the&#13;
develop[ant of hunan and material resources. Training of nationals&#13;
was neglected and the domestic econciny left in the doldruns.&#13;
37. Upon independence, Togo had to define its economic development&#13;
policy. There were no guidelines readily available. Institutional&#13;
structures and-procedures were also largely lacking. Local skills in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
economic policy matters were extremely scarce. Selective recourse was&#13;
made to foreign technical assistance to lay the foundation of an&#13;
economic policy capacity and to help create institutions to promote&#13;
development and the gradual introduction of basic economic management&#13;
tools.&#13;
38. For a newly independant country where economic policy&#13;
institutions were originally weak or non existent, economic&#13;
management might seem to be a particularly difficult challenge. There&#13;
is not only a need to define and introduce new policy mechanisms, but&#13;
also need to devise the substance of macro-economic policy, taking&#13;
into account the local and external environment,   as well as economic&#13;
prospects. The formulation of macrobeconomic policies is a complex&#13;
task which requires analytical and operational work in many areas,&#13;
such as public and private investment, fiscal and budgetary policies,&#13;
prices, monetary and credit policy, and trade (exports and imports).&#13;
In the area of macro-economic policy formulation, Togo was unable to&#13;
master all these concepts and even less able to conceive a&#13;
macroneconomic policy relying exclusively on locally available&#13;
skills. Technical assistance was doubtlessly needed for this purpose.&#13;
39. Technical assistance can be one of several critical elements in&#13;
improving macro-economic policy formulation. In Togo, technical&#13;
assistance has also been indispensable in implementing the First&#13;
Structural Adjustment Program. The First Structural Adjustment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
Program was designed to eliminate distorsions in the economry and to&#13;
pramote growth after a. period of financial and economic imbalance.&#13;
The First 'Structural Adjustment Program required a constant&#13;
involvement of several Government agerncies to implement and monitor&#13;
the numerouts actions and measures contained in the program. A&#13;
successful implementation of the program depended on the ability of&#13;
the Government agencies to deal with the day!tomday tasks implied by&#13;
the Structural Adjustment Program. The Goverrment agencies involved&#13;
had to maintain close coordination.&#13;
40. In this context, the objectives of technical assistance are in&#13;
many respects far-reaching because technical assistance can help&#13;
overcaim a limited institutional capacity to elaborate and implement&#13;
economic policies. Properly designed and implemented, technical&#13;
assistance should be able to increase policy responsiveness to&#13;
constantly changing circumstances. A major advantage of technical&#13;
assistance is the canpetence and experience it brings to bear in a&#13;
specific area. Technical assistance canl make a major contribution to&#13;
analytical work needed to define general economic policies or to&#13;
elaborate sector strategies (agriculture, industry, energy, tourism,&#13;
education, health andt population etc). The contribution of technical&#13;
assistance in different fields can naturally vary over time. In the&#13;
short run, the support provided through technical assistance can&#13;
permit meeting changing needs in the economy during a period of&#13;
economic and financial recovery. kbrthermore, in the long term, the&#13;
work undertaken by technical assistants can lead to a lasting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
improvement in the Government's institutional capacity to manage and&#13;
plan economic affairs. Such a long-term strengthening of&#13;
institutional capabilities is the main contribution expected from&#13;
technical assistance by both African Goverrments and donors. However&#13;
this objective can not be reached by technical assistance alone.&#13;
Reaching this objective requires at the national level a reform in&#13;
the existing institutions to create an appropriate framework in which&#13;
technical assistants can disseminate their know'-how to conpetent and&#13;
well-trained national staff that should be able to replace technical&#13;
assistants at an appropriate moment in the future.&#13;
41. The improvement in the Goverrnment's capacity to manage and plan&#13;
economic affairs requires a careful selection of technical assistance&#13;
: this is a crucial matter. In the past, many technical assistance&#13;
projects failed to reach their objectives, because the experts chosen&#13;
were not sufficiently qualified to reconcile their experience and&#13;
know-how with the need for enhancing the capabilities of national&#13;
staff and institutions in charge of macro-economic policy formulation&#13;
and management. In this regard, the objectives of the Togolese&#13;
Government and the World Bank are however fully congruent.&#13;
B. Selection of Technical Assistance instrunents&#13;
42. The selection of technical assistance instruments to strengthen&#13;
macro-econcmic policy formulation and management resulted from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
elaboration of the First Structural Adjustment Program and Government&#13;
needs for program imnplementation as well as, although to a lesser&#13;
degree, identification of longer tenn needs. In the case of the First&#13;
Structural Adjustment Program, the Government and the Bank together&#13;
determined areas of priority need. It became clear that&#13;
macro-economic management as a whole, i.e. public investment&#13;
progranming, debt management and control, public enterprise sector&#13;
rehabilitation, rural developmnt planning and coordination of&#13;
applied agronomic research were the areas where improvement was&#13;
needed for economic consolidation and financial stabilization, but&#13;
also in order to lay the foundation for rekindled sustained growth&#13;
and developxmnt over the mediunterm. Thus, technical assistance&#13;
needs in the context of the First Structural Adjusment program were&#13;
determined both in a short-term consolidation context and a long-term&#13;
expansion context. The problems encountered by the Togolese economy&#13;
fron 1978 onward required a realistic policy in the mobilization and&#13;
use of available resources, as well as the elaboration of a general&#13;
mediunmtern macro-econonic framework.&#13;
43. For meeting priority needs, the Government can rely on specific&#13;
instruments and organizational settings. The Government can use&#13;
long-term or short-tenn technical assistants to meet its needs. In&#13;
order to achieve greater efficiency and better use of financial and&#13;
human resources including technical assistants, the Government will&#13;
first of all have to define the objectives of the technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
assistants and then clarify their status, determine their place in&#13;
the administration, the forms of cooperation/integration with&#13;
national staff and local consulting firms, the forms of training (on&#13;
the job and outside), the material support to be provided, and&#13;
establish coordination with other sources of technical assistance.&#13;
These are preliminary steps to be completed by the Government prior&#13;
to the arrival of the technical assistants, in order to prepare for&#13;
coherent institution building especially in econcmic management. The&#13;
coordination with other sources of technical assistance is necessary&#13;
to avoid duplication of effort.&#13;
C. Specific Technical Assistance Positions Financed by the Bank&#13;
44. The areas of intervention identified as priorities by the&#13;
Togolese Governnent and the Bank concerned macro-economic management,&#13;
investment programming, debt management, public enterprise reform and&#13;
rural development planning. (See table for listing of Bank.provided&#13;
technical assistance).&#13;
45. In the macroeeconcmic management area, one adviser was provided&#13;
by the Bank, under the RDA Special Technical Assistance Program, to&#13;
assist the Government in improving policy formulation and management&#13;
of the economiy as well as in devising a coherent and feasible&#13;
macrofeconamic framework. The adviser arrived in Togo in September,&#13;
1983, for a three-year assignment. He is located within the Ministry&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
of Planning. As Senior Econanic Adviser he has played a major role in&#13;
monitoring the iirplementation of the First Structural Adjustment&#13;
Program (see terms of reference, Annex I).&#13;
46. As previously noted, the lack of a solid investment programming&#13;
system led Togo to pursue ambitious but unsound public investment&#13;
projects between 1975 and 1980. MVany of the projects carried out were&#13;
financed through external non concessional borrowings, incurred large&#13;
losses and were not able to meet their debt service obligations. The&#13;
first and second IDA Technical Assistance Projects provided an&#13;
Investment Coordinator and a Project Adviser during 1982-1985. The&#13;
goal was to assist the Government in improving public investment&#13;
programing by identifying and selecting productive projects within&#13;
the context of available resources, present and prospective, as well&#13;
as in accordance with adopted sectoral priorities (see terms of&#13;
reference Annexes II and III).&#13;
47. Debt management became a crucial task for the Government after&#13;
the numerous and uncoordinated borrowings made on the external&#13;
markets to finance the unprofitable projects executed between 1975&#13;
and 1980. During the first and second Paris Club debt reschedulings&#13;
for Togo in 1979 and 1981, the Government was unable to present&#13;
coherent data on its debt situation, which greatly weakened its case.&#13;
That inability revealed the need for technical assistance to improve&#13;
debt recording and management. In the framework of its LUA Special&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
Technical Assistance Program, the Bank provided Togo with a debt&#13;
recording and management expert to help the debt office, the Fonds&#13;
National d'Amortissement de la Dette   Publique (FNYDP),  improve&#13;
recording and management of all public debt (this was decisive for&#13;
better planning of public resource use and for elaboration of&#13;
alternative debt rescheduling policies). The contract of this adviser&#13;
which was originally for 18 months beginning in October 1983 has been&#13;
extended for eight months through December 1985 to enable him to&#13;
cornplete the debt management system adopted following his arrival.&#13;
(See terms of reference Annex IV).&#13;
48. Another troubled area of the Togolese ecornomy is the public&#13;
enterprise sector. Ilew of the numerous state enterprises created&#13;
between 1976 and 1980 are profitable e,nd the Treasury has had to&#13;
assume their debt service. The recovery of this sector is a major&#13;
step toward improvecl public sector finances. A Contract-Plan Adviser&#13;
and an Economic and Financial Analyst were provided under the Second&#13;
IDA Technical Assislance Project to the Ministry of State Enterprises&#13;
in 1983m1985, to corntribute to a streamlining of the sector, to&#13;
improve the efficiency of a lean slinmied!down portofolio of state&#13;
enterprises and to privatize or liquictate enterprises where necessary&#13;
(see terms of reference Annexes V and VI). The restructuring of the&#13;
public enterprise sector is a timeeconsuming task which requires&#13;
persistent supervision and external assistance, especially for&#13;
audits, diagnostic studies and privatization (identification of&#13;
private partners, negotiations of legal instruzments, etc...)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
49. Togolese rural development suffered in the past fran a lack of a&#13;
coherent developnent strategy as well as an absence of coordination&#13;
among the technical services. Development of the sector was further&#13;
hampered by poor incentives to producers, especially in the form of&#13;
low producer prices. The sector was neglected although it presents&#13;
many conparative advantages and has long been considered by the&#13;
Govermment to be its top sectoral priority. In order to begin&#13;
eliminating distorsions, the First Structural Adjustment Program&#13;
called for increased production and farmer inccmes through stronger&#13;
incentives, better extension services and supply of inputs, and&#13;
coordination and application of agronomic research. For this purpose,&#13;
the Second I1A Technical Assistance Project financed a Rural Planner&#13;
and a Coordinator of Applied Agronomic Research (during 1983r85) in&#13;
order to help conceive and implement new rural developnent policies.&#13;
Their assistance should help the Government tap more fully the&#13;
sizeable growth potential of the rural sector in Togo (see terms of&#13;
reference Annexes VII and VIII) * The Government has become aware of&#13;
this sector's potential. Consequently, the rural developnent&#13;
strategy spelled out in the Second Structural Adjustment Program&#13;
emphasizes increased agricultural production and exports. The&#13;
advisers financed under the Second Technical Assistance Project are&#13;
helping the Goverrnnent improve the sector strategy, define&#13;
appropriate methodologies for project identification, appraisal,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, and disseminate the results of agronomic&#13;
research activities more extensively among farmers.&#13;

IV.            ASSESSI IHE IMPACr OF lECdNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
ON INSTIIUII(L DEELOPIVENr&#13;
(in particular capacity to formulate and implement&#13;
inacro-?econcxnic policies)&#13;
A. Overall Impact&#13;
50. Ihe irnpact of technical assistance on institutional development&#13;
has to be assessed ln light of the objectives set for the technical&#13;
assistance provided. It is unrealistic to expect much institutional&#13;
development: to take place spontaneous'ly. Formulating and implementing&#13;
new economic policies is a specific, itimeFbound and monitorable&#13;
activity, whereas institutional development is less tangible, more&#13;
openeended and harder to assess. Economnic policies constitute&#13;
essentially actions. Institutional development is made up of changes&#13;
in processes. It is a relatively straightforward task to design&#13;
technical assistance to strengthen the capacity to formulate and&#13;
execute econonic policies. Designing technical assistance to promote&#13;
institutional development is a far more elusive task.&#13;
51. In the frameworlc of this study,  institutional development means&#13;
a policy or process aiming at creatingr and enhancing the capacity of&#13;
a country's institutions to perform their various tasks mainly with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
national humlan and financial resources. Promoting institutional&#13;
development will normally have to lead to the building of strong and&#13;
conpetent local institutions, able to deal each in its area, with the&#13;
various and complex challenges facing a country over time.&#13;
52. The objectives of the IDAefinanced technical assistance to Togo&#13;
during 1982-85 were manifold and to some extent mutually exclusive,&#13;
at least fron the vantage point of hindsight. From the Bank's point&#13;
of view, the technical assistance provided was intended to help Togo&#13;
devise and execute economic policies to overccme the current crisis,&#13;
while also elaborating new medium-term growth strategies for key&#13;
sectors that were to be implemented at a later stage when the crisis&#13;
had been resolved. The medium n to longnterm goal was to rekindle&#13;
growth on a sustainable basis compatible with macrogeconomic&#13;
constraints. Training of Togolese staff was also spelled out as an&#13;
important objective. Thus, fram the Bank's point of view, the&#13;
objectives where mixed both with respect to time horizon and&#13;
content. Contributing to the implementation of the Structural&#13;
Adjustment Program loaned de facto large as a nearbterm objective.&#13;
Whatever impact the technical assistants could have on the&#13;
Government's modus operandi was circumscribed not only by the&#13;
diversity of tasks assigned, but also by their length of assignment&#13;
which was two to three years. Even three years is too short a period&#13;
in which to learn the intricate ropes of the system and then promote&#13;
substantive institutional developnent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
53.  The Government's objectives for technical assistance were not&#13;
necessarily the same as for the Bank. In a few instances the&#13;
technical assistance might have been passively accepted as an adjunct&#13;
to the Structural Adjustment Program, as something the Government had&#13;
to accept in order to receive the funds. In most instances however,&#13;
it was clear that the Government was actively seeking the technical&#13;
assistance, but for what purpose? In the most general sense, the&#13;
Government agreed that the purpose was to strengthen the technical&#13;
and analytical capacity of the concerned ministry and to ensure a&#13;
transfer of skills to its national staff. In a more precise&#13;
operational sense, the Government wished to strengthen the ministry's&#13;
capacity to implement its cconponents of the Structural Adjustment&#13;
Program. In a still more precise operational sense, the impetus to&#13;
request technical assistance stermmed from a desire to strengthen the&#13;
host ministry in its dealings with other ministries. At the&#13;
ministerial level, the impetus could even stem from a desire of a&#13;
particular minister to use technical assistance to strengthen his&#13;
hand in dealing with his own staff, that is using technical&#13;
assistance as a counterbalance to local staff in whcm confidence is&#13;
limited.&#13;
54. In a general sense, there is no doubt that the technical&#13;
assistance provided by the Bank has contributed significantly to a&#13;
greater awareness of economic and financial issues, and the&#13;
implementation of a financial stabilization program supported by the&#13;
IMF and a structural adjustment program supported by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
Technical assistance has also helped crystalize thinking on what&#13;
might be required to solve these issues. Several instances of the&#13;
beneficial impact of technical assistants in these directions are&#13;
mentioned below, such as the creation of interministerial task forces&#13;
and increased contacts at the working level between the Ministry of&#13;
Planning and Technical Ministries. Fatalism has receded to be&#13;
replaced by a growing inclination to examine actions and policies&#13;
that might help resolve the constraining economic and financial&#13;
circumstances. The greater awareness of economic and financial issues&#13;
has also extended into a nascent tendency to view these issues not in&#13;
isolation, but rather in the context of a present or prospective&#13;
macro-~economic framework. Even though the framework is still&#13;
rudimentary, this nevertheless represents significant progress.&#13;
55. Implementation of IMF and Bank4supported programs has led&#13;
Togolese staff to extend their work horizons and to focus more&#13;
attention on mediumnterm issues. Technical assistance has been a key&#13;
element in this process. Plotting a feasible and desirable course for&#13;
the economy over the meditxn'-term, while ensuring internal consistency&#13;
among various ccmponents, has been an important educational&#13;
experience. Tracing a sequence of implications throughout a&#13;
simplified econanic structure can lead to some startling conclusions&#13;
and highlight the need to radically rethink initial premises. The&#13;
rigid compartmentalization of the past is beginning to break down as&#13;
inter-ministerial task forces become operational to deal with broader&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
econamic and financial issues such as coordinating and monitoring the&#13;
implementation of the Structural Adjustment Program. Technical&#13;
assistance has been instrumental in rendering these task forces&#13;
operational.&#13;
56. As a result of the greater awareness of and greater attention&#13;
paid to economic and financial issues, in several instances under the&#13;
propulsion of technical assistance, the Governement is nowadays&#13;
better prepared to participate in and to benefit fran a policy&#13;
dialogue with the E'ank and other donors. The Trogolese Government is&#13;
largely comprised of young well-educated Nlinisters possessing&#13;
considerable pride and a keen sense of national sovereignty&#13;
(sometimes interpreted in a rather extended sense). These Ministers&#13;
do not want to be, or be seen to be, losing ground to by the Bank&#13;
when discussing structural adjustment issues for want of arguments,&#13;
be they economic or political. Because of this pride, which is&#13;
essentially constructive, the Bank 's and other donors' concerns&#13;
present the Government with a formidable challenge to improve its&#13;
capacity to formulate and execute economic reform policies (and&#13;
conceivably over timne to improve institutional capacities), if only&#13;
to enable the Government to hold its own ground in discussing these&#13;
issues. Crieative tension can be a constructive force not only inside&#13;
the Bank, but also in its dealings with borrowing member countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
57. Bank-financed technical assistance in Togo has definitely been&#13;
operationally relevant in most instances, maybe even too much so to&#13;
the detriment of less tangible, more longnterm tasks that ultimately&#13;
are probably of even greater importance. Technical assistants have&#13;
themselves carried out numerous operational tasks and acted as&#13;
catalysts for the execution of many others. The sheer weight of daily&#13;
chores and the tendency in sane ministries to use technical&#13;
assistants as handymen have however meant that the technical&#13;
assistants have had a greater impact on narrow operational issues&#13;
than on broader policy issues. Technical assistants have been used&#13;
more as assistants in current operations and less as policy advisers.&#13;
Time to reflect and prepare policy option papers has been very&#13;
short. Nevertheless, most ministers are pleased with the operational&#13;
role that has evolved onto the technical assistants. They have proven&#13;
their direct and often daily usefulness to their chief and that might&#13;
well have been what was uppermost in the Minister's mind all along.&#13;
It was however only one of several objectives, although a very&#13;
important one, in the mind of the Bank.&#13;
58. The Bank has to be careful to avoid situations where operational&#13;
expediency (such as the pressure to ensure the successful&#13;
implementation of a Structural Adjustment Program) take precedence&#13;
over the longer-term objective of building up a national capability&#13;
for the management of economic affairs. Substituting technical&#13;
assistants for national staff in operational tasks is an insidious&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
way to demnotivate ithe latter and leavre a country more dependent on&#13;
external assi stance.&#13;
59. Since the irpact of technical assistance on macro-econamic policy&#13;
formulation and implementation has been limited so far because of&#13;
concentration on operational matters, it follows that the impact of&#13;
technical assistance on institutional development has so far been&#13;
even more limited. Up to now there has been relatively little&#13;
internali2;ation of policy reform capacity. Ihat is however no reason&#13;
for glumness. Institutional developnebnt is inevitably a long process.&#13;
It   is  conceivab]e that technical assistance has first to prove its&#13;
operational relevance before it can move on to beccme a major factor&#13;
in policy formulation and implementation; only after it has proven&#13;
its mettle in this second field can it proceed to the crowning&#13;
heights of institutional development.&#13;
B. Impact by Area of Intervention&#13;
60. The tasks performed by the advisers financed under the IDA&#13;
technical assistance projects has affected a broad range of issues&#13;
but their impact on policy formulation and inrstitutional development&#13;
has on the whole been weak. The poor results with respect to&#13;
institution bui-lding are due to a series of factors, of which the&#13;
most important are structural (see Section IV, c below). In assessing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
the impact of individual technical assistants, it should be kept in&#13;
mind that their impact depends on factors extending beyond their&#13;
professional and personal qualities and imnediate work setting. The&#13;
technical assistants are not operating in a vacuuin, quite the&#13;
contrary, they are part of an intricate and interdependent setting&#13;
with wide ramifications. It should hardly come as a surprise when&#13;
assessing the impact of each individual to note that the impact&#13;
varies a lot, not only between settings but also between individuals.&#13;
61.  In the area of macroeconomic management the most significant&#13;
work undertaken has been the elaboration of a mediumtnterm&#13;
macroreconomic scenario to be used as a framework for investment&#13;
programming. The Government has created a Comnission&#13;
Interministerielle de Stabilisation Financiere comprising&#13;
representatives of the Presidency, of various Economic and Technical&#13;
Ministries (Planning, Economy and Finance, State Enterprises, Rural&#13;
Development,Conmerce and Transports), the Debt Office (SNI) and the&#13;
National Office of Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest&#13;
(1FXAO). Many technical assistants drawn fron various sources&#13;
throughout the acdninistration have participated in the work of this&#13;
crucial curinittee.&#13;
62. The creation of this ccmittee is an effort by the Government to&#13;
set up an institution in which technical assistants can contribute,&#13;
together with Togolese staff, toward the formulation and adoption of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
more coherent waysto deal with econarTlic and financial matters.&#13;
Unfortunately, this committee is only an informal entity; its mnembers&#13;
are Directors of Departments who discuss macro-economic prospects on&#13;
the basis of figures and issues subrnitted by technical services.&#13;
Sc,metimes the background work is done by the technical assistants&#13;
alone without any T'ogolese staff involvement. The discussions in the&#13;
Ccamittee tend to be drawn out and tedious and deal mainly with&#13;
general issues and policies instead of technical issues required for&#13;
a solid macromeconomic policy fornulation. The macroneconomic&#13;
scenario elaborated under the guidance of the carniittee presented an&#13;
opportunity for the Governement to set up a permanent institution&#13;
which would be exclusively in charge of macroKeconomic policy&#13;
formulatioin and monitoring of econonic and financial indicators. If&#13;
that had been the case, the contribution of all the technical&#13;
assistants involved in the work of the committee would have been more&#13;
rationally exploited and would have served to strengthen the policy&#13;
analysis anad formulation skills of Togolese staff. At the moment the&#13;
camnittee is not living up to its potential.&#13;
63. The elaboration of the mediu-n tern macro-econcrnic scenario was&#13;
not handled by the Senior Economic Adviser provided by the Bank under&#13;
the IDA, special T.A. Program. A main responsibility of the Senior&#13;
Econanic Adviser would norrally have been to assist the Goverrnent in&#13;
policy formulation and in improving its rmanagement of the economy.&#13;
However, in this case, the lead role wvas played by the Investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
Programmer financed under the Second Technical Assistance Project.&#13;
This was due to the fact that the senior Econanic Adviser was placed&#13;
within a Bureau des Conseillers Economiques at the Minister's cabinet&#13;
level and has devoted most of this time to the management and&#13;
aciministration of the two lA*financed technical assistance projects,&#13;
as well as to a broad range of activities which often involved&#13;
technical ministries. He has also been regularly sollicited by the&#13;
Minister of Planning for time-consuming small tasks to the detriment&#13;
of macro)economic work. The Senior Economic Adviser has been assisted&#13;
by a Togolese counterpart, but he has not devoted much time to the&#13;
training of this counterpart in macro-economic policy formulation.&#13;
The numerous small tasks undertaken by the Senior Economic Adviser&#13;
were in any case not an appropriate framework for training in&#13;
macro.economic issues. The motivation of the Togolese counterpart to&#13;
absorb such training was also open to doubt, because he felt that the&#13;
training would not enhance in any significant way his poor career&#13;
prospects (a perhaps understandable attitude in a setting where&#13;
initiatives are rarely encouraged and where promotions are based on&#13;
criteria that can have little to do with performance). The use to&#13;
date of the Senior Economic Adviser shows that the impact of a&#13;
technical assistant on policy formulation and institutional&#13;
developtent depends partly on where the technical assistant is&#13;
located in the national adninistration and partly on the extent to&#13;
which their terms of reference are respected by government officials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
64.  Improved investment programing was an important issue in the&#13;
First Structural Adjustment Program. The main role of the Investment&#13;
Programmer was to elaborate a three.year rolling investment&#13;
prograrming system consistent with macro,economic prospects. The&#13;
Investnent Programmer arrived in Togo in October 1982, and was placed&#13;
within the Bureau des Conseillers Economiques in the Ministry of&#13;
Planning. He has worked with different departments in this ministry&#13;
as well as in technical ministries in order to prepare the three-year&#13;
investment program for 1984n1986, which was reviewed by the Bank in&#13;
January 1984. The Government and the Biank arrived at an agreement on&#13;
the conitent of the threeryear investme!nt program, which was a&#13;
condition for the release of the secornd tranche of the First&#13;
Structural Adjustment Credit.&#13;
65.  Tle preparation of the three:year investment program was the&#13;
first attempt to rationalize public investment programming in Togo.&#13;
The Investment Programmer has done good work. Ile has attempted to&#13;
reconcile various procedures of investment programning applied in the&#13;
technical ministries, mainly by training Togolese staff and by&#13;
coordinating the elaboration of the investment program at different&#13;
levels. The Investment Progranmer had no official counterpart and&#13;
was perceived as a programming director by Togolese staff. This&#13;
created some tension within the Ministry of Planning, and led to&#13;
pressure to solve this problem and to facilitate the preparation of&#13;
successive three4year investment programs. In May 1984, the Minister&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
of Planning assigned the responsibility for coordinating the&#13;
preparation of 1985nl987 investment program to the Direction de la&#13;
Coordination du Plan. The Minister took the decision to avoid&#13;
conflicts between the Investment Programmer and the staff of the&#13;
Ministry of Planning. It was also a way to strengthen the Direction&#13;
de la Coordination du Plan. This directorate will henceforth be in a&#13;
position to benefit directly from the knowshow and experience of the&#13;
Investment ProgranTner, and will be able to continue to prepare the&#13;
three-year investment program after his departure.&#13;
66. The conceptual content of the three,year rolling investment&#13;
programning system introduced by the Investment Programner needs to&#13;
be improved. The integration of the three-year programs with the&#13;
macroreconcmic framework is weak and has to be developped further. A&#13;
coherent macro-economic framework incorporating public investment&#13;
progranmed for the period 1985s9O has been established for the June&#13;
1985 Donors' Conference. Nevertheless further conceptual improvements&#13;
are needed . The Investment Programmer could strengthen the capacity&#13;
of the Direction de la Coordination du Plan by training its staff to&#13;
enable it to understand more fully the underlying technical&#13;
principles of investment programming.&#13;
67. Regarding project preparation and selection, there is need for&#13;
improvement, especially in terms of internalizing more rational&#13;
procedures. The first Project Adviser financed under the First&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
Technical Assistance Project spent more than two years in Togo in the&#13;
Bureau des Conseillers Economiques within the Ministry of Planning.&#13;
He was assisted by a counterpart and analyzed a variety of projects&#13;
at the request of the Minister. However, the contribution of the&#13;
Project Adviser to the capacity of the NMinistry of Planning to pursue&#13;
improved project evaluation techniques was very limited because he&#13;
had no close collaboration with the technical staff of the Ministry.&#13;
Relying on El single counterpart would not have been an appropriate&#13;
solution in this conl:ext, because of the need to disseminate project&#13;
analysis skills among many units within the Mlinistry of Planning.&#13;
What is required is team work. It would have been better to place&#13;
the Project Adviser vwithin an operational department where he would&#13;
have the possibility to teach Togolese staff new concepts and how to&#13;
establish a link betmween concepts and practical analyses.&#13;
68. The first Project Adviser left Togo prematurely in the Fall of&#13;
1984 (for family reasons). The Ministry of Planning remained&#13;
convinced that there was a continuing need for technical assistance&#13;
to improve project evaluation and selection, but was initially a bit&#13;
hesitant regarding the most appropriate form for such assistance&#13;
(short!1erm consultants or a long-term resident adviser). In early&#13;
1985 the Ministry of Planning opted for the previously used formula&#13;
of a longrterm resident adviser. The second Project Adviser arrived&#13;
in Togo in March 1985. To integrate him in the operational work of&#13;
the Ministry and to provide better training opportunities for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
Togolese staff, he was placed not in the cabinetnlevel Bureau des&#13;
Conseillers Economiques, but rather at the "shop floor" level of the&#13;
Direction de la Planification du Developpement.&#13;
69. The Togolese debt recording and management system has improved&#13;
substantially with the assistance of the adviser provided by the Bank&#13;
under the IDA Special T.A. Program. The adviser is an experienced&#13;
technician. He works with a team of four Togolese staff. They have&#13;
together contributed to the comfpletion of an inventory of the&#13;
external public debt and have played a major role in preparing for&#13;
Paris Club meetings by projecting alternative medium-term debt&#13;
service scenarios. Ihe work of the debt adviser is much appreciated&#13;
and seems to be a significant step toward the institutional&#13;
strengthening of the national debt office (RNADP), at least at the&#13;
technical level. A reorganization of the debt office is underway to&#13;
extend the institutional strengthening from the technical level to a&#13;
managerial level.&#13;
70. In rural development, the technical assistants have played an&#13;
active role in the elaboration of a new rural developnent strategy&#13;
and in assembling an inventory of ongoing research programs. The&#13;
Rural Planner and the Coordinator of Agronamic Research are both&#13;
working with a small team of Togolese staff in a planning and&#13;
research unit respectively. These units are located withintthe&#13;
Direction G6nerale du D6veloppement Rural. Both units have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
contributed significantly to the preparation of the rural development&#13;
projects that were submitted to the June 1985 Donors' Conference in&#13;
Lane. They also worked closely with other technical umits to meet the&#13;
various urgent requirements of the Government. Nevertheless, it is&#13;
not, certain that the close collaboration between two MAs and the&#13;
small team of Togolese staff laid the foundation for institution&#13;
building. The problem is that institutionebuilding requires a more&#13;
coherent and permanent institutional setting, rather than relying on&#13;
an ad hoc arrangement, as in this case.&#13;
71. The state enterprise sector is an area in which the contribution&#13;
of technical assistance to policy formulation and institution&#13;
building largely failed. The reasons were several. Shortly before the&#13;
arrival of the Contract- Plan Adviser and the Economic and Financial&#13;
Analyst, provided under the Second Technical Assistance Project, the&#13;
IVlinister who prepared the state enterprise component in the First&#13;
Structural Adjustment Program with the Bank left the Government&#13;
following a ministerial reshuffle in September 1982. The new Minister&#13;
behaved like a diffident outsider during the implementation of the&#13;
First Structural Adjustment Program. fie was not able to guide the&#13;
work of the technical assistants in line with their terms of&#13;
reference. Futhermore he was not willing and able to defend the&#13;
actions foreseen in the Structural Adjustment Program for the reform&#13;
of the state enterprise sector. The two technical assistants provided&#13;
to the state enterprise sector unfortunately did not have the drive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
and ingenuity to overcome the obstacles created by the changes in&#13;
their working environment. They drifted with the flotsam. The&#13;
Economic and Financial Analyst spent 17 months in Togo without&#13;
undertaking a single significant economic and financial study. Rather&#13;
he devoted nearly all of his time to day"totday tasks at the direct&#13;
request of the Minister as if his terms of reference had become&#13;
irrelevant.&#13;
72. The Contract-Plan Adviser tried, during his 19 month assignment&#13;
in Togo to introduce the contract-plan system in the state&#13;
enterprises selected by the Government in consultation with the Bank.&#13;
Since the necessary economic and financial studies on which to base&#13;
the establishment of the contractmplan were not available, the&#13;
adviser was obliged to carry out some such studies by himself to&#13;
prepare at least the three contract-plans scheduled to be elaborated&#13;
during the First Structural Adjustment Program.&#13;
73. The whole contract-plan concept was a transplant to Togo&#13;
(primarily from France and Senegal). The concept was in a sense&#13;
parachuted by the Bank into Togo . Unfortunately, the concept of a&#13;
contract-plan was not well understood in the Togolese Government.&#13;
After the Ministerial reshuffle of September 1982, the new Mlinister&#13;
of Planning expressed strong reservations about the whole concept. He&#13;
then froze the process begun by the adviser. The adviser Was not&#13;
supported by his own Minister. He left Togo at the end of his&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
contract without succeeding in having a single contract!plan adopted&#13;
and implemented. The two Togolese counterparts who had spent 19&#13;
months with him returned to their former department; they are&#13;
currently working on subjects without any relationship to the&#13;
contractQplan concept.&#13;
74. The experience with the contract-plan concept in Togo has&#13;
revealed that all the relevant government departments were not fully&#13;
aware of the farireaching implications of contract-plans, let alone&#13;
wedded to the concept. Nevertheless, the Government agreed to&#13;
implement such plans through its Ministry of Industry and State&#13;
Enterprises. The failure to gain acceptance for the concept has also&#13;
revealed that Ministers scmetimes agree to policies that they do not&#13;
have the political clout to execute. [n addition, they do not always&#13;
provide the political sumnit with sufficient information and&#13;
explanations to provide institutional, and not just personal support,&#13;
for policies agreed to. As a result, wvhen a Minister leaves the&#13;
Government, som of his key policies are liable to be discontinued.&#13;
75. To overcome this policy-disrupting institutional weakness, it is&#13;
necessary for the Government to thrash out a conmon position on major&#13;
policies before they are adopted. This should naturally be done in&#13;
the greatest possible awareness of the implications of the policies&#13;
debated,,;implications that can be more farireaching than what appears&#13;
at first g]Lance. Given the centralized, yet canpartmentalized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
structure of the Togolese Government, it might be worthwhile to have&#13;
the execution of the major new policies monitored by highly selective&#13;
presidential task forces to make sure information circulates and&#13;
ccmitment is sustained.&#13;
76. By midr-1984 IlDAfinanced technical assistance to promote state&#13;
enterprise reform was effectively stalled and on the verge of being&#13;
abandoned. Then the situation suddenly and by chance changed in a&#13;
very favorable direction. In September 1984 a new Minister of State&#13;
Enterprises was appointed. He is a hardtdriving private businessman&#13;
with a clear mandate from the Head of State to sanitize the sector,&#13;
even if this requires radical measures that could be politically and&#13;
socially sensitive. The new Mlinister has showed a very keen interest&#13;
in seeking Bank assistance for sweeping state enterprise reform. The&#13;
Mlinister is a fervent proponent of privatization and has received the&#13;
strong support of the Head of State to move vigorously in this&#13;
direction. Technical assistance in the area of State enterprise&#13;
reform has thus been given a new lease on life. Its substance has,&#13;
however, been modified to adapt the assistance to changing&#13;
circunstances. By mido1985, two technical assistants were serving in&#13;
the Nlinistry of State Enterprises with financing under the Second IDA&#13;
Technical Assistance Project. One is an Economic and Financial&#13;
Analyst carrying out a detailed program of enterprise,specific&#13;
studies to assess their performance and prospects and to elaborate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
reccumendaltions to overcane problems encountered. The other is a&#13;
Management Infornation System Expert t:rying to introduce a&#13;
much-needed monitoring of perfornance system. At the request of the&#13;
Minister, the Bank (WIC) agreed to detach a staff member for a two&#13;
year period, starting in Fall 1985, under the IIDA Special TX program.&#13;
This persorn will serve as a Cabinetnlevel adviser, dealing primarily&#13;
with privatization rnatters. Finally, the Minister has asked for&#13;
shortpnterm technical assistance to help meet the Ministry's many&#13;
training needs.&#13;
77. The various results achieved with   l)A -supplied technical&#13;
assistance reveal that the impact of technical assistance on policy&#13;
formulatiorn capacity and institutional development depends primarily&#13;
on the Govermnent's conmitment to use the technical assistance&#13;
effectively for its designated objectives. It is important that the&#13;
Government consider technical assistance as an integral part of its&#13;
overall efforts to accelerate the development of the country.&#13;
Development is not only a matter of financial and hunan resources. It&#13;
requires also lasting institutions with well-trained staff which are&#13;
able to conduct harmoniously and efficiently the entire development&#13;
process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
C. Impediments to the Attainment of Objectives of&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
78. The impact of technical assistants is critically dependent on the&#13;
environment in which they are called to work. Often the technical&#13;
assistants arrive with little or no knowledge of the country where&#13;
they will work and even less knowledge of the institutional setting&#13;
in which they are supposed to function. Being isolated or, at most,&#13;
part of a small group of expatriate advisers, they can easily be&#13;
swallowed up and paralyzed by the local bureaucracy. If that happens&#13;
the technical assistance will be largely wasted. It is therefore&#13;
important for the success of technical assistance that the receiving&#13;
environment be receptive to what technical assistance has to offer.&#13;
Receptivity transcends the attitudes of individuals in the receiving&#13;
country. It depends in a more fundamental sense on the structure and&#13;
operating habits of the administration in the receiving country.&#13;
79. The Togolese administration suffers frorn deeprbrooted shortcomings&#13;
both with respect to structure and operating habits that tend to&#13;
limit the impact of technical assistance. These shortconings relate&#13;
to the orientation of work, allocation of responsibility, political&#13;
constraints, staff use and so on. It can also be argued however that&#13;
these shortconings are part and parcel of the state of&#13;
underdevelopment, and that if they did not exist, there would be no&#13;
need for technical assistance in the first place. Be that as it may,&#13;
the point is that technical assistants are called upon to work in a&#13;
far from perfect environment that can seriously limit their&#13;
usefulness. Constraints must be identified early on with a view to&#13;
their gradual removal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-.&#13;
80. The Togolese administration is still in many ways a bloated and&#13;
inert bureaucracy. It relishes in exercising administrative controls.&#13;
Policy formulation and implemnentation are not part of its&#13;
well.-established repetitive operations. The econony is to be&#13;
controlled through a bevy of regulations rather than mnanaged by&#13;
modulating incentives and impersonal market forces. Initiatives are&#13;
rarely encouraged. Don't rock the boat seems to be the prevailing&#13;
attitude. Inactivity is preferable to making a mistake. In such an&#13;
encrusted, regulationrbbent and torpor-filled setting, technical&#13;
assistants and reform4minded governernent officials have a long,&#13;
arduous up-hill struggle to develop first an inclination toward&#13;
econcmnic policy formulation and implementation and, second a capacity&#13;
for implementation.&#13;
81.  A rigid, fragnented and often haphazard division of labor&#13;
between departments involved in econ(mic and financial matters does&#13;
not help either. T'De rural sector is for instance the target of both&#13;
the Ministry of Rural Development ancl the Ministry of Rural Works. It&#13;
was only in 1983 that the Ministry of Planning stopped considering&#13;
unspent buidget allocations at yearmend as automatically carried over&#13;
into the next year, whereas the Ministry of Finance autcmtically&#13;
cancelled budge-t allocations unspent at year-end and prepared the&#13;
next year's budget on that assumption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
82.  The limited continuity in senior government positions is also an&#13;
impediment to an efficient use of technical assistance. Since 1982,&#13;
when the preparation of the First Structural Adjustment Program got&#13;
under way in earnest, there have been three ministers of Planning. In&#13;
the highly personalized political setting of Togo, changes in&#13;
ministers are often accompanied by sharp reversals in policy, both&#13;
in substance and form. Newly arrived ministers tend to be suspicious&#13;
of the policies pursued by their predecessors and sometimes even of&#13;
the staff inherited. They have showed a marked proclivity for wanting&#13;
to leave their own personal imprint on policies to be pursued. The&#13;
behavior generated by such attitudes is inevitably detrimental to the&#13;
sustained pursuit of mediumterm objectives.&#13;
83. An important political constraint on the usefulness of&#13;
technical assistance is the degree of commitment by the political&#13;
leadership to greater rationality in economic policy formulation and&#13;
implementation. In the Togolese context top-level political&#13;
decision-making resides in the Head of State. It is not clear to what&#13;
extent he can be personally aware of the detail of the economic and&#13;
financial issues facing Togo. What is clear however is that it is&#13;
difficult for a single person, no matter how experienced and astute,&#13;
to fathom the depths of all these issues. Going beyond policy&#13;
formulation to the even more fundamental matter of instituti6nal&#13;
reform, it is not a foregone conclusion that the Head of State is&#13;
today ready to contemplate sweeping institutional reform that would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
contribute to more rational econamic policies, especially since such&#13;
a sweeping institutional reform might   require a less centralized and&#13;
politicized decisionomaking process.&#13;
84. At a nmunber of points we have stressed that the Government's&#13;
policy regarding the objectives to be sought by having recourse to&#13;
technical assistance is not coherent. Nor has it remained consistent&#13;
over time, given the limited continuity in senior governmental&#13;
positions. Each Minister responsible for a technical department tries&#13;
to use technical assistance according to his own objectives, which&#13;
are often at variarnce with those pursued by his predecessor. This&#13;
weakness and others stems fram the lack of a precise general policy&#13;
of the Government regarding the role of technical assistance in the&#13;
administration. ApeLrt fram the DDAebfinanced technical assistants in&#13;
the framework of the Structural Adjustment Program to help manage the&#13;
economy, many of the other technical assistants are provided by&#13;
various sources at the request of a minister without consulting his&#13;
colleagues in the Government. Same technical assistants are located&#13;
in the ministries writhout specific tems of reference and are&#13;
occupied by dayLtor,day tasks depending de facto on the shifting whims&#13;
of the Minister. The contribution of such technical assistance to&#13;
policy formulation and institutional developmnt is virtually nil.&#13;
Such ad hoc,technical assistance tends to disorganize existing&#13;
structures and discourages national staff by the praminent role&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
played by such technical assistants in daily operational matters. In&#13;
some instances, even technical assistants financed under IDA credits&#13;
and with specific terns of reference are solicited for day-to'5day&#13;
duties and are thereby delayed in executing their work as spelled out&#13;
in their contract.&#13;
85. The lack of coherence in goverrment policy regarding the&#13;
objectives of technical assistance and its place in the&#13;
administration explains the often difficult integration of technical&#13;
assistants in the operational structure of their respective&#13;
ministries. As the technical assistants are solicited almost daily by&#13;
their ministers, they gain a prominent stature which creates some&#13;
tension with Togolese staff. Their position as advisers of ministers&#13;
in key areas but outside their terms of reference does not facilitate&#13;
a coherent monitoring of their performance. Their contribution to&#13;
work such as studies, memos etc... is all too often read by only the&#13;
Minister having requested the note. Technical assistants are&#13;
conspicuously well paid and live in luxury compared to their Togolese&#13;
colleagues; this is inevitably a source of resentment and annoyance.&#13;
If technical assistants are not working themselves out of existence&#13;
by filling a training role, Togolese staff see little justification&#13;
for their irritating presence.&#13;
86. The use of the counterparts appointed to work with the technical&#13;
assistants has not proven to be the most appropriate way to integrate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57-&#13;
the technical assistants in the operational structure of their&#13;
respective ministries. The notion of a counterpart was ambiguous, and&#13;
sometimes meant that the technical assistants had only to deal with&#13;
their counterparts to the exclusion of other local staff. Even so,&#13;
the notion of a counterpart remained nebulous. What should be the&#13;
proper relationship between the technical assistants and their&#13;
counterparts? Who plays the lead role in guiding the work? Are one,&#13;
two or three counterparts sufficient to create the appropriate&#13;
conditions for the transfer of skills and for training? These&#13;
questions were not fully addressed when the formula was adopted. The&#13;
counterparts ultimately came to be considered as    support staff for&#13;
the technical assistants by undertaking routine tasks when the&#13;
technical assistant:3 were busy meeting the requirements of the&#13;
Minister. T[his situation has led to Iiinited training of counterparts&#13;
and strained relations between technical assistants and Togolese&#13;
staff.&#13;
87. Progressively, Togolese staff became less motivated and more&#13;
frustrated visnAvvis the technical assistants who are paid much more&#13;
and correctly perceived to be more influential in decision9making.&#13;
Consequent-ly, scme lechnical assistants have become isolated and&#13;
reduced to the role of ministers' hancly.men, preoccupied with&#13;
administration and rarious daily duties. Because of the relatively&#13;
limited reliance on technical assistance in Togo, there is (unlike&#13;
some other African countries) little prestige to be gained by a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-58-&#13;
Minister by having a visible expatriate adviser. Visible exposure of&#13;
this kind is more likely to provoke reproaches. Ministers are&#13;
naturally aware of this prevailing attitude and rely on expatriate&#13;
advisers only if they see a patent need therefor and then only for&#13;
their technical expertise and perceived efficiency, despite the&#13;
disgruntlement this is bound to create within the administration. A&#13;
corollary of this approach to technical assistance is that in Togo,&#13;
there are hardly any traces of a network of high-level technical&#13;
assistants that have their own internal lines of communication&#13;
outside of and parallel to regular governnent lines of ccmmunication.&#13;
88. There are nevertheless recurring disputes between technical&#13;
assistants and Togolese operational department Directors, who feel&#13;
relegated to second place by the technical assistants enjoying close&#13;
and priviledged access to the Minister. In extreme cases this can&#13;
lead to the emergence of a kitchen cabinet comprised of technical&#13;
assistants which monopolize the treatment of critical issues to the&#13;
detriment of the operational departments and thereby the involvement&#13;
of Togolese technical staff. Training of Togolese staff becomes a&#13;
minor concern, the job gets done but with no lasting impact on local&#13;
capabilities. The Togolese are not becoming prepared to replace the&#13;
technical assistants and are not able even after two or three years&#13;
of technical assistance to formulate and implement reform policies.&#13;
Some senior government officials have therefore concluded that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-&#13;
technical assistance is not useful, forgetting however that the&#13;
Government itself has often not created appropriate conditions for&#13;
the use of technical assistance. It is therefore necessary that the&#13;
Government undertake a deep reflexion on the role of technical&#13;
assistance and subsequently adopt a coherent policy on how best to&#13;
use technical assistance to strengthen durably its capacity for&#13;
economTic policy fornulation and implernentation.&#13;

AND INSTI1UTIONL DEWiLOPVENT&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
89. The experience with technical assistance in Togo reveals that&#13;
technical assistance is a malleable instrument in reinforcing a&#13;
limited national capacity to deal with econanic and financial&#13;
matters. Technical assistance can be molded into a form of inmediate&#13;
usefulness to the host Government. This is certainly an advantage,&#13;
but it is also a disadvantage. Unless care is taken, technical&#13;
assistance can be insidiously revamped to focus on short*term issues&#13;
at the expense of longmterm issues, the resolution of which&#13;
constitutes the raison d'etre of technical assistance.&#13;
90. This is exactly what happened in Togo with the IA-.tfinanced&#13;
technical assistance provided during 1982e85. The pressure to deal&#13;
with shortatterm operational issues was so great that the intended&#13;
multidaceted role of technical assistance was usurped, almost&#13;
inadvertently, into focusing just about exclusively on short-term&#13;
operational issues. The fate that befell the Senior Econonic Adviser&#13;
in the Ministry of Planning is a case in point. Overflowing with a&#13;
willingness to help out, he quickly became preoccupied with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
monitoring the implenmentation of the First Structural Adjustment&#13;
Program ancd with ackdinistering the two IDA4financed technical&#13;
assistance projects. Both were timeconsumning tasks. He filled a&#13;
critical hole for the Government and his services were greatly&#13;
appreciated, but they were delivered at the cost of squeezing out&#13;
almost coapletely the time available for econcnic policy work.&#13;
91. More generally, out the window went most of the objectives to&#13;
provide staff training and to promote policy formnulation and&#13;
implementation. Progress toward these latter two objectives should&#13;
over time have permitted a slow but steady internalization of an&#13;
enhanced cawpacity to formulate, execute and monitor macrofieconomic&#13;
policies in an evolving more propitious institutional setting.&#13;
B. Specific Reccamiendations Adopted to Improve the Third&#13;
IMArfinanced Technical Assistance Project.&#13;
92. Despite the various problems encountered, continuation of&#13;
IDAefinanced technical assistance to l'ogo is warranted; provided&#13;
there is a change in form and substance to allow the assistance to&#13;
contribute more effectively to an institutional strengthening of the&#13;
capacity for macrobeeconomic policy formulation. The third&#13;
I]DA-financed technical assistance project in Togo was approved by the&#13;
Board of Executive Directors on May 30, 1985, and reflects these&#13;
concerns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62-&#13;
93. First, project administration and management is to be assumed by&#13;
a recently appointed fullntime Togolese project director. Technical&#13;
assistants are far too expensive to handle these tasks and have&#13;
rarely a comparative advantage in so doing. Furthermore, Togolese&#13;
feelings might be bruised by having a foreigner assume such a visible&#13;
managerial position.&#13;
94. Second, a full'.time Togolese training director has been appointed&#13;
to make sure training of Togolese staff is not given short shrift&#13;
under the weight of pressing inmediate operational matters. Training&#13;
is such a laudable objective that everybody can agree on the&#13;
importance of providing training, at least in abstract. In reality,&#13;
work loads are often such that training is one of the first items to&#13;
be sacrificed. The main responsibility of the training director will&#13;
be to make sure that operational and monitorable training programs&#13;
are prepared... and executed. The stage when good and anodyne&#13;
intentions were sufficient should belong to the past.&#13;
95. Third, technical assistants are to be transferred from the&#13;
cabinet level in ministries to the operational departments doing the&#13;
actual work. Technical assistants are no longer to be placed as&#13;
outside adjuncts to ministers, to whon they have privileged access&#13;
(much to the resentment of local staff, who feel undermined and&#13;
shortLcircuited by such an arrangement). By the same token, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-&#13;
concept of a counterpart is abandoned. In the case of Togo,&#13;
counterparts were left hanging in an awkward institutional limbo not&#13;
knowing what would happen to them once the technical assistant with&#13;
whom they had worked departed. Instead, technical assistants will&#13;
henceforth work as advisers to incumbent line operators, that is,&#13;
Togolese staff that already hold responsible positions, and positions&#13;
that they would normally keep upon the departure of the technical&#13;
assistants. The latter would generally work with several Togolese&#13;
line operators simultaneously to prcmote team work and to permit Togo&#13;
to benefit optimally frcm the various skills the technical assistant&#13;
is charged with transferring.&#13;
96. The Togolese experience also shows that it is vitally important&#13;
to distinguish between two internrelated but still separate types of&#13;
technical assistance, i.e. technical assistance to help meet the&#13;
needs of Bank and INF programs (short-tenm tasks) and technical&#13;
assistance designed to pranote institutional development (long-term&#13;
tasks). If no distinction is made, the former will squeeze out the&#13;
latter. Separate instruments are probably required to meet these two&#13;
types of technical assistance needs. In the case of Togo, the&#13;
appointment of a Togolese technical assistance project director&#13;
assuming responsibility for project management and the monitoring of&#13;
the Second Structura.l Adjustment Program (1) should ultimately enable&#13;
the Senior Econanic Adviser in the Ministry of Planning to&#13;
concentrate on econcmic policy issues and institutional development.&#13;

together with the Third Technical Assistance Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
C. A Receptive Framework&#13;
97. Over and above the specific recommendations adopted to improve&#13;
the Third Technical Assistance Project in Togo, there are several&#13;
general recommendations that can be heeded in designing technical&#13;
assistance projects aimed at promoting macroe~economic policy&#13;
formulation and ultimately institutional developnent.&#13;
98. The receptivity of the framework into which the technical&#13;
assistants are to be transplanted is a critical factor that needs to&#13;
be carefully assessed. How firm and durable is the cannitment in the&#13;
host country, from the technical level to the top political level, to&#13;
use technical assistance to prcmote macroweconcmic policy&#13;
formulation? An unambiguous meeting of minds is needed in spelling&#13;
out the objectives of the technical assistance. Terms of reference&#13;
must be clearly spelled out, but should leave a carefully delineated&#13;
margin of flexibility to avoid overspecification. There is no way&#13;
technical assistants can be barred from serving as handymen for&#13;
ministers, but such a practice should be occasional and not&#13;
systemtic.&#13;
99. Political constraints will doubtlessly continue to be present&#13;
in the pursuit of improved macroneconomic policy formulation, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65-&#13;
this is no reason for despondency. There will always be a trade-off&#13;
between economic rationality and political imperatives. At stake is&#13;
the degree of the tradeboff, and here technical assistance, aimed at&#13;
strengthening macro-economic policy formulation, can be very useful&#13;
in helping tilt the balance toward greater econoxnic rationality 4&#13;
even if the tilt, at least initially rnight be imperceptibly small.&#13;
This is a ,long and painstaking learning experience for most&#13;
developing countries, but few political leaders are so biased and&#13;
blind to facts that they will not, if sometimes grudgingly,&#13;
ultimately recognize the merits of macro-veconomic policies that&#13;
produce results in terms of generation of additional resources.&#13;
100. Institutional development requires institutional reform. This&#13;
might sound like a tautology, but it should be recognized that&#13;
technical assistants are called upon to work in an interdependent&#13;
setting where many reinforcing factors are needed for success. If&#13;
obstacles wvhich are often of an institutional nature are not removed&#13;
(such as over.centralization and compartmentalization), the&#13;
contribution of teclnical assistants to macroFeconomic policy&#13;
formulation and ultimately to institutional development can be&#13;
seriously circumscribed.&#13;
101.  The contribution of technical assistants to macroDeconomic&#13;
policy formnulation would be enhanced :if the host Government could&#13;
proceed to define a more rational and clear role differentiation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66-&#13;
between the public and private sectors. In the same vein, a&#13;
modification in the modus operandi of the public sector would be&#13;
helpful by putting more emphasis on policy formulation geared to&#13;
incentives and market forces and by putting less emphasis on&#13;
administrative controls and market interventions. Although markets in&#13;
many developing countries are often less developed and more imperfect&#13;
than in developed countries, there exists nevertheless on untapped&#13;
potential for reliance on market forces in the short,term and an even&#13;
greater potential over the long-term as markets are developed and&#13;
imperfections removed. Such a progressive increase in the reliance on&#13;
market forces (progressive if only to avoid abuses caused by market&#13;
imperfections) would also permit economizing on administrative&#13;
skills, skills that are often in critically short supply in&#13;
developing countries. Furthermore, policy formulation would receive a&#13;
boost if governments could be convinced of the merits (whenever&#13;
feasible) of trying to modulate the behavior of economic agents&#13;
instead of substituting for them (in other words, to have government&#13;
focusing on activities best suited for the public sector).&#13;
102. Less centralization and more delegation are obvious targets for&#13;
institutional reform. The same holds for less compartmentalization&#13;
and a more rational division of labor around concrete monitorable&#13;
tasks, including tasks assigned to technical assistants. There is&#13;
finally a need to ensure a more complete overlap between&#13;
responsibility and accountability, in combination with the provision&#13;
of the means required to obtain specific objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-67-&#13;
D. Staff policies&#13;
103. The developrEnt of a country depends first of all on the&#13;
capacity of its mnnagers to deal with recurring challenges, in a wide&#13;
range of areas. Togo is confronted with serious financial constraints&#13;
and a stagnating economy. These dificulties can be overcome only if&#13;
economic management is in the hands of competent and motivated staff.&#13;
The current econonic and financial clifficulties have led the&#13;
Governmernt to freeze salary increases in the civil service, and the&#13;
motivation of the civil servants has sagged badly. They are on the&#13;
whole discouraged and little prone to work hard. The Goverrment can&#13;
however change this trend by improving staff management and by&#13;
developing career prospects according to objective criteria. Such&#13;
staff policies recluire that primacy be given to competence over&#13;
nepotism and that promotion to high-,level positions be decided&#13;
without subservience to political oI' ethnical considerations.&#13;
Outstanding individual performances could be rewarded through&#13;
pecuniary and other benefits. For instance, a new emphasis could be&#13;
given to the annual performance evaluation system applied in the&#13;
civil service. The evaluation fonns could be reviewed by selective&#13;
camittees chairecl by an official frcom the Ministry of Labor and&#13;
Public Employment. The committees would specialize according to&#13;
professional category. After reviewing the perfornance of staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-68-&#13;
according to openly announced professional criteria, the coumittees&#13;
would be authorized to grant selective promotions accompanied by&#13;
salary increases. The Government could also adopt a training policy&#13;
which would facilitate a reallocation of its best staff toward areas&#13;
of critical managerial and policy shortcomings.&#13;
104. Because of financial constraints, the Government has been&#13;
obliged to reduce current expenditures, which has led to diminished&#13;
expenditures for materials and office equipment. The policy of&#13;
severely restraining outlays on materials and supplies is detrimental&#13;
to a proper functioning of the civil service. The lack of office&#13;
supplies stiples motivation still further and creates ultimately a&#13;
pervasive feeling of indifference. While continuing to monitor&#13;
closely current expenditures, the Government will nonetheless have to&#13;
find a more appropriate balance between cempeting expenditure claims&#13;
within tight financial constraints in order to provide the materials&#13;
and supplies needed for a proper functioning of the civil service,&#13;
without which policy reform and institutional development would not&#13;
get off the ground.&#13;
E. Aid Coordination&#13;
105. The Bank is not the only provider of technical assistance aimed&#13;
at strengthening the local capacity to formulate and implement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-69--&#13;
macroreconcmic policies. Even though most other providers of&#13;
technical assistance probably focus less on policy issues (than does&#13;
the Bank) and more on operational issues, there is clearly a need for&#13;
aid coordination to avoid duplication and waste and to ensure a high&#13;
degree of canplementarity.&#13;
106. Furthermore technical assistance to promote economic policy&#13;
formulation is a sensitive matter. It has far!.reaching implications,&#13;
often extending to all major donors no matter which specific types of&#13;
projects they happen to finance in any given country. In addition,&#13;
policy formulation inevitably contains an element of judgement&#13;
(although the smaller the better), but this means that there can be&#13;
roam for genuine disagreement regarding which policy would be the&#13;
most appropriate to pursue. Unless such disagreements are ironed out&#13;
at an ear]Ly stage, the Government will at best be confused and at&#13;
worst inclined to exploit such disagreements among donors to its own&#13;
shortdterni advantag,e. In the latter case the effort to strengthen the&#13;
policy formulation process could suffer lasting damage.&#13;
107. The need for close coordination among donors extends frran the&#13;
policynoriented technical assistance they finance to the policy&#13;
advice they themselves proffer to the host country. This is most&#13;
clearly the case when the country has concurrently ongoing Bank and&#13;
Fund structural adjustment and financial stabilization programs, but&#13;
is really a dictun of general applicability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70-&#13;
F. Redefining the Role Proper of Technical Assistance&#13;
108. Togo will still need technical assistance for a certain&#13;
unspecified length of time to formulate and implement economuic&#13;
policy. Togolese staff are competent in many areas but not yet fully&#13;
able to deal with macroeeconomic concepts and to handle&#13;
macro-econcmic management. However, the past experience indicates a&#13;
clear need for the Government to redefine clear and timenbound&#13;
objectives for technical assistance. Until recently, the Government&#13;
was not aware of this need, because it did not absorb the signals&#13;
(scome of which were admittedly rather muted) that called for a new&#13;
approach in designing and managing technical assistance. The rather&#13;
less than satisfactory results obtained with MA . supplied technical&#13;
assistance in institutional developnent show that it is crucial when&#13;
specifying the objectives to determine whether technical assistance&#13;
in a particular area is intended to promote and strengthen&#13;
institutional development or essentially to help execute operational&#13;
tasks or policies.&#13;
109. The definition of precise, consistent and appropriate objectives&#13;
should always be a key element of technical assistance project&#13;
design. Nowadays, almost any technical assistance project should&#13;
include measures to foster institutional capacity as well as measures&#13;
to monitor progress. There is a need to orient technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71 -&#13;
toward analytical thinking such as policy elaboration and&#13;
implementation, economic and financial analysis and investment&#13;
progranming. The definition of coherent objectives related to the&#13;
tenrs of reference and combined with a realistic timetable for the&#13;
work expected to be carried out is a pre-condition for a better use&#13;
of technical assistance.&#13;
110. Furthermore, it is necessary to create and prcomote a climate of&#13;
partnership between technical assistants and local staff. It will be&#13;
interestirng to monitor the results of the Third Technical Assistance&#13;
Project, vwhich places technical assistants in advisory positions&#13;
within operational departments where they will work under national&#13;
managers in close contact with Togolese staff. This is a crucial&#13;
issue. It presupposes that the technical assistants will be&#13;
sufficiently perceptive to adapt to local conditions (political and&#13;
social) and that they will possess skills required for training and&#13;
team work.Technical assistants with outstanding technical credentials&#13;
are however not alvways good trainers. Personality traits are critical&#13;
in determining who is a good trainer and not, but personality traits&#13;
can be difficult to assess in advance on the basis of written&#13;
evidence. Given the overriding importance of training, a technically&#13;
less sophisticated assistant would be preferable if he possesses&#13;
superior training skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72-&#13;
111. The ability of the technical assistants to train their Togolese&#13;
colleagues and to transfer effectively and durably their skills to&#13;
enhance the capability of local staff to formulate and implement&#13;
economnic policy after the departure of the technical assistants is&#13;
absolutely fundamental. This will be the major criterion in&#13;
evaluating the contribution made by technical assistance to the&#13;
development of Togo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-73-&#13;
VI.  COtUJUSIONS&#13;
112. The experience of the IDAnfinanced technical assistance in T'ogo&#13;
during 19,82-85 in the context of the preparation and implementation&#13;
of the hArst Structural Adjustment Program has revealed many&#13;
shortcomings, but not enough to question the concept of technical&#13;
assistance. In a receptive setting and if perceptively conceived and&#13;
implemented, technical assistance can still be a valuable instrument&#13;
to be used toward the attainment of crucial objectives during the&#13;
development process. These objectives do however evolve with time,&#13;
and technical assistance has therefore to adapt to prove its&#13;
continuing usefulness. Task-oriented technical assistance will&#13;
gradually give way to process-oriented technical assistance as&#13;
national talents are developed and replace expatriate staff in&#13;
operations. Continuing technical assistance is only warranted if it&#13;
can move up the ladder of abstraction to promote policy formulation&#13;
and implementation, and ultimately   over the longer run to foster&#13;
institutional development. This will enable the host country to&#13;
internalize economic management and policy fonnulation capabilities&#13;
in order to be in a position to deal successfully, on its own, with&#13;
ceaselessly evolving economic challenges and opportunities. If and&#13;
when that happens, technical assistance will have been crowned with&#13;
ultimate and las-tilng success. By the same token, it will have run its&#13;
course and can be withdrawn for good.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-74-&#13;
113. A receptive environment is crucial for the success of technical&#13;
assistance. This is a major lesson fron the Togolese experience.&#13;
Unless the Government has defined a clear and consistent policy with&#13;
respect to technical assistance, its usefulness will be limited and&#13;
resources likely to be squandered. A clear and consistent policy&#13;
could for instance comprise the following elements: global assessment&#13;
of needs in an evolutionary context, objectives kept few and&#13;
clear-cut with separate instruments used for their attainment,&#13;
handseon training for nationals closely monitored and assessed, and a&#13;
tight yet realistic schedule for a gradual phasing out of technical&#13;
assistants.&#13;
114. Beyond a clear policy, the receptivity of the government&#13;
machinery is important. If the structure of government is such that&#13;
technical assistants tend to be put into isolated cubicles, they will&#13;
more likely than not be poorly used. Viewing the terms of reference&#13;
as operationally relevant and worth the expenditure of time and&#13;
effort, instead of as an administrative nuisance that can be&#13;
discarded at whim, will enable the technical assistants to spend more&#13;
time on fundamental issues rather than dissipating their attention&#13;
among a multitude of daily chores. By resisting the temptation of&#13;
burying the technical assistants under a mountain of daily tasks,&#13;
their chances of having a lasting impact on government capabilities&#13;
are improved. Receptivity is however a twomway street. No matter how&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75--&#13;
receptive the environment might be, the technical assistants will&#13;
founder if they temse]ves are not receptive and able to adapt to&#13;
local conditions. Finally, there is an tuavoidable element of risk in&#13;
the envirorym!nt. Technical assistance oiten means personalized&#13;
service. If the Minisler or senior government official having&#13;
requested the! technical assistance is replaced, the prospect of&#13;
success for that particular technical assistance could change&#13;
markedly. The change could be in either direction but is often in an&#13;
unfavorable direction given the personalized nature of technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
115. The objectives oi technical assistance can be numerous,&#13;
overlapping and conflicting and will therefore have to be carefully&#13;
spelled out if optimal use is to be made of technical assistance.&#13;
What mighit be useful in the shortnrun could be ephemeral and at the&#13;
expense of lasting longer!'term usefulness. Three basic types of&#13;
technical assistance can be distinguished in this respect: first&#13;
assistance in operations, second assistance in policy formulation and&#13;
third assistance in institutional,development, in rising order of&#13;
abstraction and likely longeiterm impact. Without proper safeguards,&#13;
assistance in operations is likely to crod out the other two more&#13;
fundamental types of assistance.&#13;
116. With considerable development of national talents already having&#13;
taken place, the need for technical assistance in operations should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-&#13;
nowadays be largely a matter of the past. Technical assistants are&#13;
too expensive to handle these nuts and bolts issues, and if they do&#13;
their lasting impact can be indiscernible. Technical assistance in&#13;
operations tends to frustrate local staff and to stifle needlessly&#13;
the developrmnt of nascent local talents. Technical assistance in&#13;
operations ought therefore to be highly selective.&#13;
117. Technical assistance in policy formulation is harder to&#13;
conceive, because the subject matter is less tangible than for&#13;
operations. Nonetheless Bank and IMF supported programs present major&#13;
challenges to goverrnnents to improve policy formulation capabilities.&#13;
This is a critical gap that can usefully be filled by technical&#13;
assistance during the initial stages. Under an external support or&#13;
impulsion greater discipline in policy formulation and implementation&#13;
is achieved, minds are focused on critical issues and horizons are&#13;
broadened. Given the origin of these improvements their&#13;
sustainability beyond the campletion of the Bank and IMF supported&#13;
programs is however open to some doubt.&#13;
118. This is why technical assistance in institutional development is&#13;
critical. Unless technical assistance has been furnished to&#13;
internalize the enhanced policy fonmulation and implementation&#13;
capabilities, they are likely to wither away with the ccmpletion of&#13;
the Bank and IM  ! supported programs or after the withdrawal of the&#13;
technical assistance. Rendering the improved capacity for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-77-&#13;
macromeconcnic policy formulation and implementation a permanent&#13;
feature of the host govermnent touches the very nerve center of&#13;
govermment operations. It requires top flight technical assistance&#13;
patiently and perceptively pursued-over many years.&#13;

            Institutional development and technical
            assistance in macroeconomic policy formulation : a case
            study of Togo
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper analyzes the contribution
            made by IDA-financed technical assistants to institutional
            development in macro-economic policy formulation in Togo
            during 1983-85. The Government's comprehensive policy
            response to a deteriorating economic and financial situation
            is presented with emphasis on the role of technical
            assistance. The performance of the resident technical
            assistants financed by IDA is reviewed. Institutional
            development has overall been limited because technical
            assistants have been absorbed by current operational tasks.
            On the basis of the mixed experience so far, the paper goes
            on to make recommendations to improve the contribution of
            technical assistance to institutional development in
            macro-economic policy formulation. Clear objectives and a
            receptive framework are cited as key factors. Different
            instruments are needed depending on whether technical
            assistance is aimed at performance of tasks, facilitation of
            processes or promotion of institutional development.
