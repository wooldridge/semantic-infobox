L. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
1.1   The Kvrgyz Republic (KR) is a small, land-locked country with a population of 4.5&#13;
million and an estimated per capita income of US$ 830 (1993). The energy sector is relatively&#13;
large and has an important role in the economy. The country has abundant low-cost hydropower&#13;
resources which have been partially developed, small oil and gas production, and a collapsing&#13;
coal industry. Under the Former Soviet Union (FSU), the country evolved from an&#13;
agriculturally-based economy to one with a significant industrial base which accounted just prior&#13;
to independence for about 40% of GDP. The economy was also highly integrated with the rest&#13;
of the FSU. A net importer of coal, petroleum products and natural gas, the KR is a net&#13;
exporter of electricity to neighboring republics (mainly Kazakstan). Since independence, energy&#13;
import prices have risen sharply toward international levels while economic activity in the region&#13;
has declined. The result has been a deterioration in the terms of trade for the KR, with net&#13;
energy imports contributing about US$110 million to the annual trade imbalance (estimated at&#13;
US$119 million in 1994).' This occured despite a halving of energy consumption due to sharp&#13;
declines in industrial and agricultural production during 1991-94. At the same time, household&#13;
consumption of electricity and natural gas, which are highly subsidized, rose rapidly.&#13;
1.2   The Government of the KR (GOK or the Government) recognizes the energy sector's&#13;
importance in economic recovery and growth as the country makes the transition toward a&#13;
market economy, and its policies call for increased efficiency in energy production and use,&#13;
reduced government involvement in the sector and efforts to attract private sector involvement&#13;
in developing domestic resources. The Bank carried out a review of the overall energy sector&#13;
in 1994, the findings of which are summarized below.2 The proposed Power and District Heating&#13;
Rehabilitation Project is consistent with GOK's priorities and the findings of the Bank's review,&#13;
and will help implement key actions to improve the power and heat sector's performance.&#13;
A.    ENERGY RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND TRADE&#13;
1.3   KR's energy resources comprise: oil and natural gas, coal, wood and other biomass, and&#13;
hydropower. Remaining recoverable oil and gas reserves in the Fergana Valley are estimated&#13;
at 12 million tons and 6.5 billion cubic meters. Production of most of the remaining oil reserves&#13;
will require enhanced recovery methods; further, since there was limited exploration for oil and&#13;
gas in the KR during the Soviet era, several potentially promising oil provinces (e.g., East Chui&#13;
and Alai Valleys) have yet to be systematically explored. Proven coal reserves (hard and brown&#13;
coal) are about 1.2 billion tons, of which 650 million tons have been prepared for mining;&#13;
however, commercial exploitation of these reserves is severely handicapped by the mountainous&#13;
terrain and consequent difficult access to the deposits, as well as the location of potential&#13;
markets. The standing stock of wood in the forest estates is estimated at 23 million cubic meters&#13;
and is threatened by illegal cutting for wood fuel. Dung is commonly used as fuel, and efforts&#13;
are being made to promote solar and micro-hydro, but the economic context is not favorable.&#13;
KR's hydropower potential is estimated at 26,000 MW, of which about 2,870 MW has been&#13;
developed on the lower Naryn River. Production in a normal hydrological year is 10,000 GWh;&#13;
In 1995, with the decrease in power exports and the increase of the price of gas and petroleum products,&#13;
net energy imports are estimated at US$170 million and the annual trade imbalance at US$227million.&#13;
2 Kyrgyz Republic: Energy Sector Review (Report No. 14036-KG of May 15, 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                    The Energy Sector&#13;
however, as there is a need to store water for summer irrigation in downstream countries of&#13;
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, most of the energy is produced in summer when it is least needed.&#13;
Development of a further 2,260 MW upstream, which could be constructed at relatively low unit&#13;
cost and operated without irrigation constraints, was initiated before the break-up of the FSU but&#13;
has been suspended due to the lack of financing.&#13;
1.4   Energy balances for 1991 and 1994, in physical units and tons of oil equivalent (toe), are&#13;
given in Annex 1.1. Domestic energy production (1.6 million toe in 1994, down from 2.7&#13;
million toe in 1991) accounted for about 40% of the country's primary energy supply (including&#13;
exports) in 1994. Primary production of electricity (hydropower) has remained stable during&#13;
1991-94, while coal production has collapsed as a result of market-based pricing of coal, so that&#13;
the closing of at least some mines is unavoidable; oil and gas production has continued at low&#13;
(and declining) levels.  The cost of producing and transporting domestic coal makes it&#13;
uncompetitive with alternative energy sources in the KR including imported coal and natural gas;&#13;
in addition, electricity prices are highly subsidized and the Government has deliberately&#13;
encouraged consumers to switch to increased electrical use for heating and cooking. Thernal&#13;
power generation and district heating at the two combined-heat-and-power plants in Bishkek (609&#13;
MW) and Osh (50 MW) has halved during 1991-94.&#13;
1.5   The Kyrgyz Republic depends on its Central Asian neighbors and Russia for about 60%&#13;
of its primary energy supply as well as for its exports. Energy imports fell sharply from 5.5&#13;
million toe in 1991 to about 2.2 million toe in 1994. Imports of petroleum products and natural&#13;
gas have declined sharply since 1991 due to falling domestic demand. Imports of coal have also&#13;
halved. KR is a net exporter of electricity due to its hydropower resources but in the absence&#13;
of long term export contracts, the quantities exported fluctuate and are uncertain.&#13;
1.6   Key factors affecting the country's future energy production and trade include: (a) the&#13;
rate of economic recovery in the Kyrgyz Republic and neighboring republics; (b) trading&#13;
arrangements negotiated with neighboring countries; and (c) KR's ability to attract private sector&#13;
participation and financing to enhance production of domestic coal, oil, natural gas and&#13;
hydropower resources. 1994 has been a year of stabilization for the Kyrgyz economy, and there&#13;
is some optimism that a gradual recovery will begin in 1995-96. Regional energy trade will&#13;
continue to be critically important for the country; negotiating long-term contracts with equitable&#13;
terms of trade and working out appropriate payment systems are a high priority for the&#13;
Government. In the future, the energy sector should be increasingly self-financing rather than&#13;
a drain on the national budget and balance of payments. The present under-utilization of the&#13;
sector's supply capacity provides an important opportunity for the Government to restructure and&#13;
rehabilitate the sector without being under intense pressure to add new capacity. This will be&#13;
critical to achieving greater private sector involvement in the sector and to sustaining present&#13;
production levels let alone increasing them as the economy begins to recover.&#13;
B.    ENERGY CONSUMPrION&#13;
1.7   Primary energy consumption in the Kyrgyz Republic in 1991 was 6.8 million toe, or&#13;
1,510 kilograms oil equivalent (koe) per capita. While low when compared to other FSU&#13;
countries, it was relatively high compared to middle-income countries in Asia and Latin&#13;
America. By 1994, consumption had more than halved, reaching 3.3 million toe and 740 koe&#13;
per capita. This paralleled the decline in the economy's real output (GDP).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Energy Sector                                                                   3&#13;
1.8   On a sectoral basis, household consumption of energy declined by 36% during 1991-94,&#13;
while consumption by industry, agriculture and transport fell to 33 %-45 % of their pre-&#13;
independence levels. Household and industrial shares of final energy consumption also changed&#13;
drastically, with households now accounting for 39% and industry 32% (shares in 1991 were&#13;
27% and 41%, respectively). With final consumption of petroleum products, coal, district&#13;
heating and gas declining by 30% -76%, electricity remaining more or less constant, and&#13;
firewood and dung increasing, the resource mix has also changed. In the case of electricity,&#13;
household consumption more than doubled during 1991-94 while industrial and agricultural&#13;
consumption fell by 23%-43%. This reflects the increased use of electricity for cooking and&#13;
heating, and has resulted in overloading of the transmission and distribution systems. Total&#13;
energy consumption in the Kyrgyz Republic is unlikely to fall further, although the trends in&#13;
interfuel substitution may continue in the near term as coal loses more ground to electricity.&#13;
Once economic growth recovers, energy consumption will inevitably rise but at a slower rate&#13;
than GDP as energy efficiency measures begin to have some impact. The breakdown of primary&#13;
energy supply by fuel type and sectoral distribution of final energy consumption for 1991 and&#13;
1994 are given in Annex 1. 2.&#13;
C.    ENERGY PRICING&#13;
1.9   Significant adjustments have been made in energy prices in the Kyrgyz Republic since&#13;
independence although distortions still exist in relative prices; recent trends in Kyrgyz energy&#13;
prices are given in Annex 1.3. Prices of coal, petroleum products and natural gas for industry&#13;
are now largely at international levels, with import prices passed through to consumers.&#13;
Consistent with GOK's general policy of eliminating distortions caused by a command economy&#13;
and reducing the state's role, prices of coal and petroleum products have been fully liberalized.&#13;
However, prices of the network energies--electricity, district heating and natural gas for&#13;
households--remain under government control and have been kept artificially low and the&#13;
structure heavily biased in favor of household consumers. This has led to distorted energy&#13;
consumption patterns, inequitable prices for some consumers and a deteriorating financial&#13;
condition for the utilities.&#13;
1.10 The Government has agreed, as part of its 1994-97 stabilization program with the IMF,&#13;
to raise energy utility tariffs to households to achieve cost recovery. Further increases will be&#13;
necessary to ensure the power and gas utilities' abilities to make needed investments to&#13;
rehabilitate and expand their facilities as well as achieve a reasonable return on their assets. At&#13;
the same time, GOK will need to protect low-income consumers impacted by rising energy&#13;
prices, perhaps through provision of cash subsidies, fuel coupons or lifeline tariffs; increased&#13;
taxes on petroleum products (e.g., gasoline) could be used to fund such assistance.&#13;
D.    ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY IROVEMENTS&#13;
1.11  There are major inefficiencies inherited from the FSU and there remains scope for&#13;
efficiency improvements on both the supply and end-use sides. On the supply side, for example,&#13;
there is potential for loss reduction in electricity distribution and district heating, both of which&#13;
will be addressed under the proposed Project through rehabilitation and upgrading of the present&#13;
systems in selected areas. On the end-use side, economic pricing, proper metering and enforced&#13;
payment collection together with promotion of energy conservation and consumer education&#13;
could lead to improved energy efficiency. Considerable progress has been made in terms of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                      The Energy Sector&#13;
pricing as noted above, and the various energy agencies are initiating procedures for improved&#13;
collections; these issues would also be addressed in the case of electricity and district heating&#13;
under the proposed Project. The household survey carried out in connection with the Bank's&#13;
Energy Sector Review in mid-1994 found a high level of ignorance about energy saving&#13;
opportunities which will need to be addressed through consumer education. Under EU-TACIS&#13;
assistance, energy audits of twelve selected industries and twelve commercial and apartment&#13;
buildings were carried out and provided recommendations for energy savings.  During&#13;
negotiations, the Government agreed to implement, by December 31, 1997, the recommendations&#13;
for energy conservation and efficiency, including use of high-efficiency household appliances and&#13;
introduction of regulatory measures to improve energy efficiency in existing and newt, buildings.&#13;
E.    ORGANIZATION OF THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
1.12  The energy sector in the Kyrgyz Republic comprises six state-owned enterprises&#13;
responsible for electricity and district heating (KNEHC - Kyrgyz National Energy Holding&#13;
Company), coal mining (Kyrgyzk-umyr) and distribution (Krygyztopsnab), petroleum exploration&#13;
and production (Kyrgyzneft), petroleum products distribution (Kyrgyzmunaizat) and natural gas&#13;
distribution (Krygyzgas), and one state committee, Goskomgeologia, responsible for mineral&#13;
resources (including petroleum) exploration on a national level. Central coordination of the&#13;
sector is diffuse: (a) KNEHC and Goskomgeologia report to a Deputy Prime Minister; and (b)&#13;
the remaining energy enterprises come under the aegis of the Ministry of Industry and Trade&#13;
(Annex 1. 4). The Anti-Monopoly Commission under the Ministry of Economy sets utility tariffs&#13;
based on submissions from the power and gas utilities. The State Property Fund is also involved&#13;
in managing government holdings in state enterprises and formulation of privatization plans.&#13;
With the relaxation of the Government's involvement in the energy sector, the domestic private&#13;
sector has ventured into trading and distributing petroleum products, LPG and coal, and coal&#13;
mining.&#13;
1.13  For now, public sector enterprises remain responsible for the bulk of activities in the&#13;
sector. Most of the enterprises (except Kyrgyzneft) have been cut off from the national budget,&#13;
and the Government has little or no control over their operations while management has&#13;
considerable powers. Governance and financial management of the enterprises, however, are&#13;
very weak, and in many respects, they remain akin to government departments (e.g., in terms&#13;
of adopting social policies) instead of operating on a commercial basis. Prior to independence,&#13;
most decisions were taken by the central authorities in the FSIJ. so that local expertise in policy&#13;
and planning matters is limited. There is a need for a central focal point, in the form of a&#13;
relatively small energy cell/unit within the Government. for formulation and oversight of general&#13;
energy policies on GOK's behalf. Moreover, the legal and regulatory framework needed to&#13;
underpin GOK's plan to reduce its involvement in the sector and bring in greater private sector&#13;
participation has yet to be put in place. Assistance is being provided in this regard for inter alia&#13;
preparing and implementing an overall energy law and regulatory framework, electricity law,&#13;
petroleum law and model contract, and modifying the subsurface resources law. Assistance will&#13;
also be needed in restructuring, commercializing and ultimately privatizing those energy&#13;
enterprises which are viable and in closing those which are not. Under the proposed Project,&#13;
assistance will be provided for developing an overall strategy for restructuring the power and&#13;
heat sector and beginning to implement it through restructuring and commercialization of&#13;
KNEHC; this will build on earlier assistance from EU-TACIS and EBRD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Energy Sector                                                                     5&#13;
F.    ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
1.14 A national environmental action plan (NEAP) for the Kyrgyz Republic has been prepared&#13;
with the assistance of the Bank3. The priority areas for the energy sector include watershed&#13;
management (affecting hydropower resources) and dam safety, emissions from coal-fired thermal&#13;
plants and boilers, and coal mining operations (including pending closures of uneconomic&#13;
mines).  Attention to reviewing and developing as necessary environmental standards and&#13;
regulations, strengthening of monitoring and enforcement capabilities, and developing the&#13;
capacity to carry out environmental impact assessments and efficiency/environmental audits are&#13;
being given priority under the NEAP definition of environmental liability for past pollution and&#13;
establishing legal guidelines for settling liability conflicts are also important complements to the&#13;
country's privatization process. The proposed project will improve efficiency in production and&#13;
use of electricity and district heating (including reducing water usage), and will upgrade&#13;
instrumentation and control equipment and install emission monitoring devices at the Bishkek&#13;
thermal plant (609 MW).&#13;
G.    SECTOR DEVELOPNIENT STRATEGY&#13;
1.15  The year 1994 was a milestone in the Kyrgyz Republic's transition to a market economy.&#13;
GOK's commitment to reform was sustained through difficult economic circumstances. The&#13;
country is at a critical juncture, whereby the Government now needs to foster actual changes in&#13;
institutions, economic agents and the manner in which they interact. GOK's key medium-term&#13;
goals in this process are to: (a) consolidate and deepen the stabilization and structural reform&#13;
program; (b) lay the legal, institutional and regulatory framework for renewed growth; and (c)&#13;
maintain an adequate social safety net and alleviate rural poverty. Improving energy sector&#13;
efficiency is an important element of this broader reform program, and actions needed to achieve&#13;
this parallel those required for the overall economy.&#13;
1.16  The main focus of GOK's post-independence energy policy has been: (a) increased&#13;
reliance on indigenous energy supplies to reduce imports; (b) restructuring of energy entities to&#13;
increase their autonomy and self-sufficiency; (c) attracting private sector participation to improve&#13;
efficiency and mobilize financing; (d) establishment of the legal and regulatory framework to&#13;
facilitate the above; (e) introduction of energy pricing policy to encourage efficient use and&#13;
sustain sector development but also take account of social objectives; (f) promotion of energy&#13;
conservation and use of renewable energy; and (g) modernization and development of the&#13;
sector's production capacity. The Government has articulated these goals/objectives in both its&#13;
Energy Program of Kyrgyzstan (1992) and Energy Concept Paper (1995) and, with assistance&#13;
from donors, is proceeding to act on them.&#13;
1.17  As indicated above, the energy sector has undergone many changes since 1991 and some&#13;
progress has been made in adjusting its operations toward a more market-based approach. As&#13;
in the case of the country's overall economic reform program, however, further actions are still&#13;
required in a number of areas. Key among these are: (a) adjusting network energy prices and&#13;
improving collections; (b) restructuring, commercializing and ultimately privatizing energy&#13;
enterprises which are viable and closing those which are not; and (c) preparing the necessary&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                     The Energy Sector&#13;
legal, regulatory and institutional framework for the sector's development. These actions are&#13;
outlined in more detail in the Bank's Energy Sector Review and have been discussed with the&#13;
Government. GOK is in general agreement with the recommendations and intends to implement&#13;
them. As for physical investments in the energy sector, the priority for the near-medium term&#13;
will be rehabilitation and upgrading of existing facilities, measures to improve energy efficiency&#13;
both in supply and use, and completion of projects which have been stopped due to lack of funds&#13;
provided a firm market is in place for the project's output. With plans to turn many activities&#13;
in the sector over to the private sector, GOK's main investment concerns will be the energy&#13;
utilities since the private sector will make its own investment decisions.&#13;
1.18 Donor Assistance. A number of agencies (ADB, EBRD, European Union-TACIS,&#13;
Islamic Development Bank and World Bank) and bilateral donors (Austria, Denmark, Germany,&#13;
Japan, Norway, Switzerland and U.S.) have been involved in providing assistance to the Kyrgyz&#13;
energy sector over the last three years.  The proposed Project, which is expected to be&#13;
co-financed by ADB, Danida, Nordic Development Fund and the Swiss Government, will assist&#13;
GOK and KNEHC to address policy, price and management issues in the power and heat sector&#13;
as well as to rehabilitate and upgrade existing facilities, hence improving efficiency and&#13;
reliability of supply. The Bank is also providing assistance to the upstream petroleum sector&#13;
through execution of (a) a Norwegian Trust Fund grant supporting preparation of a petroleum&#13;
law, model contract and fiscal regime; and (b) a Japanese PHRD grant supporting review and&#13;
assessment of existing geological/geophysical data. If warranted, the proposed project will assist&#13;
GOK carry out a promotion of the country's petroleum prospects, to the international oil&#13;
industry.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
II. THE POWER AND HEAT SECTOR&#13;
A.    PAST POWER AND HEAT CONSUMPTION AND SUPPLY&#13;
2.1    Power Market. Domestic demand for power and heat have remained stagnant or declined&#13;
over 1991-94, while the structure of the markets have changed significantly. In the case of&#13;
power, the share of residential consumers increased from 15% to 40% during 1990-94, while&#13;
that of industrial consumers declined from 45% to 26%. The near tripling of residential&#13;
consumption is explained by the low price for electricity, particularly relative to alternative&#13;
heating and cooking fuels.  Further, the government promoted the use of electricity (i.e.,&#13;
hydropower) to substitute for imported fuels including, coal, fuel oil and natural gas'. The&#13;
decline in industrial as well as agricultural consumption of electricity is explained by the&#13;
economic difficulties confronting the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
2.2     As a result, trends in domestic electricity sales in recent years have been as follows:&#13;

Bishkek and the surrounding Chu valley accounted for 41 % of electricity sales in 1994, followed&#13;
by the Osh (24%) and Dzhallal Abad (13%) districts. The country is effectively fully electrified;&#13;
KNEHC has just under 975,000 connections, of which 950,000 are residential consumers. The&#13;
average monthly consumption of residential consumers is fairly high (301 kWh in urban areas,&#13;
259 kWh in rural areas) and is on the rise, which can be explained mostly by the increasing use&#13;
of electricity for heating.2 Further details on the domestic power market are in Annex 2.1.&#13;
2.3    Regarding export sales, KNEHC's power system is interconnected to the Central Asian&#13;
Integrated System (CAIS), which also includes Kazakstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and&#13;
Uzbekistan. In recent years, electricity (on a net basis) has been exported to Kazakstan, and&#13;
I      A Presidential Decree dated January 11, 1993 underscores the accelerated development of domestic energy&#13;
resources and conversion of installations to electricity.&#13;
2      Average monthly residential consumption in Bishkek at 117 kWh is about a third of the national average&#13;
due to extensive use of district heating in the city (about half of the population of Bishkek has district heating).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                  The Power and Heat Sector&#13;
reserve capacity and frequency regulation services have been provided to the CAIS. In 1993,&#13;
small-scale exports to China were initiated.&#13;
2.4    Southern Kazakstan is presently the main export market for KNEHC electricity surpluses.&#13;
Unlike most power export contracts which are of a long-term nature, the agreement with&#13;
Kazakstan is renewed on an annual (or even more frequent) basis. Exports declined from about&#13;
4,000 GWh in 1990-91 to 1,000 GWh in 1993, due to the general economic decline in the&#13;
region; in 1994, they increased to 2,500 GWh due in part to an unusually wet year, and are&#13;
expected to be 1,500 GWh in 1995. In 1995, however, there was no agreement until mid-year&#13;
(and thus no exports) which underscores the importance of concluding long term export&#13;
arrangements, particularly given KR's endowment with hydropower resources and its neighbor's&#13;
dependence on fossil fuels.&#13;
2.5    Heat Market. KNEHC supplies district heating (heat, hot water and process steam) to&#13;
consumers in Bishkek, Karakol, Karakul, Kyzil Kiya and Osh. District heating sales in recent&#13;
years have been as follows:&#13;

2.6    The overall volume of district heating sales in 1994 is thus about half that of 1990-91.&#13;
While industrial consumption has fallen because of the economic situation, the main reason for&#13;
the overall decline is rationing by KNEHC, including ceasing supply of hot water during the&#13;
warm season, to conserve imported fuels. Increased use of electrical heaters and boilers is&#13;
offsetting the reduced temperatures at which heat is supplied in the winter. In 1994, 56% of the&#13;
heat was sold to residential consumers, 22% to public administration/other (schools, hospitals,&#13;
etc.), 18% to industry and the balance to agriculture (mostly greenhouses). Bishkek alone, with&#13;
370,000 consumers, accounts for about 80% of the district heating market. Recently completed&#13;
energy audits show that per capita consumption of heat and hot water in the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
are high relative to that in comparable climates in Western Europe; this can be attributed to lack&#13;
of temperature control and metering at the user end, poor building insulation and low district&#13;
heating tariffs.&#13;
&#13;

The Power and Heat Sector                                                                 9&#13;
B.    EXISTING FACILITIES&#13;
2.7    Electricity. KNEHC operates 20 power plants with a total installed capacity of 3,532&#13;
MW, including 18 hydropower plants (2,873 MW) and two combined heat-and-power (CHP)&#13;
plants in the cities of Bishkek (609 MW) and Osh (50 MW). Power balances for recent years&#13;

2.8   In 1994, KNEHC generated 12,860 GWh, of which 1,140 GWh were from thermal&#13;
plants and 11,720 GWh from hydro plants. Net sales including exports were 10,336 GWh and&#13;
the peak load 2,173 MW. System losses have more than doubled since 1990-91, reaching 17%&#13;
of gross generation in 1994. The peak load has also increased significantly, despite net sales&#13;
declining. Both factors suggest increasingly inefficient operation of the system and can be&#13;
attributed at least in part to the rapid growth in residential sales, particularly the increased use&#13;
of electricity for heating. Overloading of the transmission and distribution networks and&#13;
insufficient maintenance have contributed to the increased system losses; the low price and lack&#13;
of incentives to use electricity off-peak (e.g., seasonal and time-of-day tariffs) have contributed&#13;
to the growth in peak demand. While the system is not presently constrained by generating&#13;
capacity due to the economic situation, it is affected by limitations in the transmission and&#13;
distribution network capacity.&#13;
2.9    Hydroelectric Generation Facilities. The bulk of installed hydro capacity is located on&#13;
the Naryn cascade. The program to develop the lower Naryn river began in the 1960s with the&#13;
construction of Uch-Kurgan, (4 x 45 MW), which has now accumulated over 33 years of&#13;
operation and is in need of refurbishing. In the 1970s, the Toktogul reservoir, with 16 billion&#13;
cubic meters water storage (about one and a half times the annual inflow) and 1,200 MW (4 x&#13;
300 MW) installed capacity, was constructed upstream to provide regulation of the Naryn river&#13;
together with the Kurpsai plant, (4 x 200 MW). Subsequently, two projects were developed in&#13;
the cascade, Tashkumir (3 x 150 MW) and Shamaldisai (3 x 80 MW); construction of neither&#13;
project is fully complete. At Tashkumir, the dam needs to be raised to provide adequate head&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                             The Power and Heat Sector&#13;
to the turbines, and at Shamaldisai, the equipment for the third unit is on site but not installed.&#13;
Further details on KNEHC's generating facilities are in Annex 2.2.&#13;
2.10  Thermal Generation Facilities. Bishkek and Osh are supplied with electricity and heat&#13;
by the country's only two thermal CHP stations. Bishkek TES 1 consists of 10 steam turbines&#13;
and 24 boilers with the capability of burning coal, fuel oil and natural gas. Its nominal capacity&#13;
is only 558 MW (instead of 609 MW) and 1,360 MJ/s (1,157 Gcal/hr) when generating both&#13;
heat and electricity. An additional 660 Gcal/hr could be produced from heat-only boilers&#13;
(HOBs) and pre-heat boilers. The Bishkek plant presently burns mainly Kazak coal under barter&#13;
arrangement.  Osh TES 1 consists of two 25 MW  steam turbines and three boilers with a&#13;
combined capacity of 375 tons per hour. The boilers at Osh are designed to burn only fuel oil&#13;
and natural gas. Further details on installed generating capacity are in Annex 2.2.&#13;
2.11 Bishkek TES 1 plays a key role in the supply of power to the northern region and of heat&#13;
to Bishkek. However, out of its 24 boilers, 13 have accumulated over 100,000 hours of&#13;
operation; among the remaining boilers seven have been selected for refurbishment and life&#13;
extension. Also four out of the ten turbines have accumulated over 200,000 hours of operation&#13;
and need to be monitored regularly with non-destructive metallurgical tests. Construction of a&#13;
new 90 MW turbine, which is on site, could not be completed because of the equipment was&#13;
only partially delivered. There are also problems with obsolescence and wear on plant auxiliary&#13;
systems, such as coal handling, compressed air, water make up, air pollution control, ash&#13;
storage, and instrumentation and control which affect plant availability, efficiency and&#13;
environmental impacts. The review of alternatives for the supply of power to the system and&#13;
heat to the city of Bishkek has concluded that refurbishment of Bishkek TES 1 is the least cost&#13;
alternative.&#13;
2.12  Transmission and Distribution Facilities. At the end of 1994, the transmission system&#13;
in the Kyrgyz Republic consisted of 545 km of 500-kV lines, 1,150 km of 220-kV, and 4,440&#13;
km of 110-kV lines. The distribution system consisted of 4,310 km of 35-kV lines, 39,380 km&#13;
of 10-kV and 6-kV lines, and 29,350 km of 0.4-kV lines. There are a total of 498 step-down&#13;
transformer substations (500, 220, 110 and 35-kV) with a total capacity of 8,620 MVA. Further&#13;
details on KNEHC's transmission and distribution facilities are in Annex 2.3. The Kyrgyz&#13;
transmission system is part of the Central Asian Integrated System integrated at 500 kV and 220&#13;
kV (see map IBRD 27 671). The northern part of the Kyrgyz Republic is connected to the&#13;
south, where the bulk of hydro generation is located, through a 500-kV transmission line&#13;
crossing the mountain ranges at 3,500 meters altitude and through a second 500-kV line at lower&#13;
altitude via Uzbekistan and Kazakstan.&#13;
2.13 The 500-kV and 220-kV transmission lines appear sufficient to meet demand requirements&#13;
up to the year 2000. However, the change in the structure of the demand away from high-&#13;
voltage industrial consumers to low-voltage household and commercial consumers has caused&#13;
serious overloading of the 1 10-kV and 35-kV systems, 220/1 10-kV and 110/35-kV transformers&#13;
and the distribution systems of major load centers. These facilities were already in poor&#13;
condition due to lack of maintenance. The results are excessive losses, voltage drops and&#13;
fluctuations, outages, and damage to transformers, cables, meters and other equipment. During&#13;
the 1993-94 winter, 2,261 of KNEHC's 17,000 distribution substations were found to be&#13;
overloaded; the situation in winter 1994-95 was worse, leading to voltage drop and widespread&#13;
interruption of supply. In the Issyk-Kul and Naryn regions the voltage drop in winter are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

The Power and Heat Sector                                                                  11&#13;
beyond what would be tolerable. System losses were 17% of net generation in 1994 and are&#13;
estimated at 20% in 1995, while in an efficient power system they should be less than 10%.&#13;
Reduction of these losses will require sizable investments in rehabilitation upgrading and&#13;
reinforcement of the transmission and distribution network.&#13;
2.14 District Heating. The Kyrgyz Republic has district heating (DH) systems in Bishkek,&#13;
Karakol, Karakul, Kyzil Kiya and Osh. Supply of heat in Bishkek and Osh is mainly from&#13;
combined heat-and-power plants while Karakol, Karakul and Kyzil Kiya are supplied from heat-&#13;
only boilers, some of which have recently been replaced by electrical boilers. The overall DH&#13;
network consists of about 460 km of hot water and steam lines, the bulk of which are in Bishkek&#13;
(about 331 km of hot water lines and 57 km of steam lines). Heat balances for recent years are&#13;
as follows:&#13;

2.15   The Bishkek DH system, developed in the 1950s, is the oldest in the country and serves&#13;
about half of the city's population. The main network in Bishkek is supplied with heat from&#13;
TES 1 and the industrial plant Frunze. Before the break-up of the FSU, a new CHP plant,&#13;
Bishkek TES-2, was planned at the other end of the city. To date, however, only a peaking&#13;
HOB plant (2 x 95 Gcal/hr) has been constructed, and although it was commissioned in 1993,&#13;
the plant has not been put in commercial operation because of KNEHC's financial difficulties&#13;
in paying for fuel oil and natural gas supplies. Apart from the large plants, a number of smaller&#13;
municipal and industrial boiler houses also supply heat to local networks. The total installed DH&#13;
capacity in Bishkek is 2,290 Gcal/hr (Annex 2.4). At present, this allows for about 100%&#13;
reserve capacity, as the peak demand is estimated at about 1,000 Gcal/hr, due in part to&#13;
KNEHC's rationing to save imported fuel.&#13;
2.16   The district heating system  in Bishkek has large heat and water losses (heat losses&#13;
estimated at 20-25% and rising),3 poor quality of heat supply and reduced life of the system due&#13;
to corrosion of the steel pipes. The main causes are: (a) use of a constant flow, variable&#13;
temperature system with no temperature control or metering at the user end; (b) greater reliance&#13;
on HOBs which should be used mainly for peaking, and use of old and obsolete equipment&#13;
3  Historical data in the table above significantly understate DH system losses due to lack of system metering and&#13;
billing based on standard consumption norms; the figure of 20-25% losses is based on studies carried out by the&#13;
Energy Advisory Group funded by EU-TACIS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                              The Power and Heat Sector&#13;
combined with inadequate maintenance; and (c) use of transmission and distribution network&#13;
technology which leads to low life expectancy and high heat and water losses. These problems&#13;
could be addressed by rehabilitation and modernization of the system through the introduction&#13;
of variable flow which would allow the economic dispatch of heat supply and control of&#13;
temperature at the user end. The proposed project would support these investments.&#13;
C.    SECTOR PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
2.17  Since the Kyrgyz economy is in transition between two different economic systems,&#13;
long-run forecasts of electricity and heat demand are not reliable. This is compounded by the&#13;
uncertainty regarding the impact of tariff increases and enforcement of strong billing and&#13;
collection measures to reduce non-technical losses. Consumption of power and heat in the&#13;
productive sectors of the Kyrgyz Republic has dropped sharply since 1991, concurrently with&#13;
the drop in GDP; electricity exports have also fallen in line with the general economic decline&#13;
in the region. In contrast, residential consumption of electricity has more than doubled over the&#13;
same period.  As the economy stabilizes and begins a gradual recovery, power and heat&#13;
consumption can be expected to grow slowly, but at a somewhat slower pace than that of GDP.&#13;
It is expected that agriculture and services will lead economic recovery and the future role of&#13;
industry will be less than before independence. It is further expected that the Government will&#13;
shift away from its present policy of promoting the use of electricity for uneconomic purposes,&#13;
such as switching residential and commercial consumers to electrical heating, which has led to&#13;
significant increases in residential use of electricity and overloading of the transmission and&#13;
distribution network in recent years (para. 2.11).&#13;
2.18  Assuming, in accordance with the Bank's macro projections, an average annual GDP&#13;
growth rate of 3-5 % through the end of the decade, power sales could be expected to rise by 2-&#13;
4% per annum on average, while heat sales could be expected to increase in the next couple of&#13;
years (as KNEHC reduces its rationing) and then level off as sales to new consumers are offset&#13;
by improved efficiency of heat supply; indicative power and heat sales forecasts are in Annex&#13;
2.5. Present power generation and heat production capacities would be expected to be sufficient&#13;
to meet this demand through at least 2000, including leaving a margin for electricity exports of&#13;
1,500 GWh or more a year. To ensure adequate reliability and efficiency in supplying demand,&#13;
KNEHC's priority investments in the near-medium term include: (a) rehabilitation, upgrading&#13;
and extension of the power transmission and distribution system; (b) rehabilitation and upgrading&#13;
of the district heating systems in Bishkek and Osh; and (c) retrofitting of the CHP plant in&#13;
Bishkek. Priorities over the medium-longer term include: (a) completion of the Tashkumir and&#13;
Shamaldisai hydropower plants; (b) overhaul and retrofitting of existing hydropower plants, e.g.,&#13;
Utchurgan and At Bashi; and (c) upgrading of the telecommunication and network control&#13;
systems. Addition of new generating and production capacity will only be justified once there&#13;
is sufficient demand; development of large scale investments for power exports, such as the&#13;
Kambarata 1 and 2 hydropower projects, as well as completion of the 220-kV line to China,&#13;
would have to be linked to long-term power sales agreements.&#13;
2.19  In addition to the proposed project, EBRD and Switzerland are also providing assistance&#13;
in rehabilitation, upgrading and limited extension of KNEHC's transmission system.  A&#13;
framework transmission and distribution system master plan has been prepared with assistance&#13;
from USAID as part of preparation for the Bank's project. An assessment of the condition and&#13;
potential for modernization and expansion of the district heating systems in Bishkek and Osh was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Power and Heat Sector                                                                       13&#13;
carried out in 1994-95, with assistance from EU-TACIS. An evaluation of the hydroelectric&#13;
potential in the Kyrgyz Republic was also prepared in 1993, with assistance from USAID.&#13;
KNEHC's present investment program  was reviewed and found acceptable during project&#13;
appraisal (Annex 5.2). During negotiations, KNEHC agreed to review with IDA, by October 31&#13;
of each year, starting in 1996, its proposed investment program for the followingfive years and&#13;
to take IDA's views into consideration in finalizing the program.&#13;
D.    ELECTRICITY  AND DISTRICT HEATING TARIFFS&#13;
2.20 Social considerations and GOK's policy of promoting use of domestic power supplies&#13;
have been the main underlying reasons for keeping power and heat tariffs artificially low and&#13;
the structure biased towards household consumers. The result, however, has been an&#13;
unsustainable deterioration in KNEHC's financial situation, inefficient and uneconomic energy&#13;
consumption, and inequitable prices for some consumers.&#13;
2.21   Electricity tariffs used to be differentiated by consumer group, the main categories of&#13;
consumers being: industrial (which in turn were differentiated by size - above or below 750&#13;
kVA), agriculture, public administration (schools, hospitals, etc. ) and residential (where a&#13;
distinction was made between urban and rural consumers). In recent years, because of the high&#13;
inflation rates and upward revision in prices of imported fossil fuels, electricity tariffs have been&#13;
revised frequently and the tariff structure simplified. Electricity tariffs were last revised on July&#13;
1, 1994 until the recent increase of April 5, 1996, and are presently as follows:&#13;
ELEcmcrry TARIFS STRucruRE a/&#13;

a/ Except for residenrial includes 20% VAT&#13;
2.21   Other characteristics of the domestic electricity tariffs include: (a) the residential tariff&#13;
is about half that of other consumer categories, while the associated charges per connection are&#13;
markedly higher; (b) the initial block under the household tariff is particularly large and is&#13;
applied incorrectly;4 (c) there is no monthly minimum charge to cover fixed costs; (d) the&#13;
industrial tariff is not made up of a capacity charge as well as an energy charge, generally an&#13;
4  Normally the first block would be subsidized to support low-income households; the second block is designed&#13;
to encourage energy conservation. In the Kyrgyz Republic, consumers are entitled to a new lower-priced block&#13;
whenever they pay their bill. Further, a bill frequency analysis in Bishkek and the Chu district indicates that 80%&#13;
of consumers are using less than 300 kWh; not all of these would be low-income households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                                     The Power and Heat Sector&#13;
important incentive for industrial consumers to use energy efficiently; (e) the tariff structure does&#13;
not provide for time-of-day or seasonal differentials, consistent with varying costs of power&#13;
generation; (f) the tariffs are not indexed (e.g., with respect to fuel costs, inflation, exchange&#13;
rate), hence KNEHC incurs losses on this account due to delays in tariff adjustments; and (g)&#13;
various special discounts apply for electricity use, with the result that most household consumers&#13;
qualify for a further 50% discount.&#13;
2.22   A comparable tariff structure applies to district heating, for which tariffs were last&#13;
revised in November 1994 until the recent April 5, 1996 increase as shown below:&#13;

a! Includes 20% VAT&#13;
2.23   The district heating tariff has similar deficiencies to the electricity tariff as residential&#13;
consumers pay only 24% of the tariff paid by other consumer categories while the corresponding&#13;
cost of supply is the same or somewhat higher. Further, household consumption of heat and hot&#13;
water is not metered, rather a flat monthly rate is charged' and there are no controls by which&#13;
consumers can regulate their heat consumption. District heating tariffs do not cover production&#13;
costs; and since district heating is not separated financially from electricity supply, losses in&#13;
district heating are covered by the electricity consumers, particularly those who do not have&#13;
access to district heating.&#13;
2.24 Tariff Study. A power and heat tariff study, grant-financed by ADB in connection with&#13;
its cofinancing of the proposed project, will be carried out to determine the cost structure for&#13;
various consumer categories and to specify a tariff structure based on economic and financial&#13;
considerations.  Introduction of indexation of tariffs, time-of-day and seasonal tariffs, and&#13;
capacity and minimum charges will also be considered in the study. KNEHC staff would&#13;
participate fully in the study, with a view to their receiving training for future tariff setting.&#13;
Terms of reference for the study were discussed during appraisal. GOK gave the assurance that&#13;
the study on power and heat tariffs being financed by ADB technical assistance grant, will be&#13;
completed by December 31, 1996, and that by July 1, 1997, power and heat tariffs will be set&#13;
in accordance with the recommendations of such study.&#13;
2.25   As an interim measure, to begin to correct the current tariff distortion, electricity and&#13;
district heating tariffs have been adjusted on April 5 1996. Further, a decree has been issued&#13;
recently providing for a tariff increase to take effect on July 1, 1996, that will enable KNEHC&#13;
to recover all cash costs for 1996 on an annualized basis.&#13;
Households are charged 0.48 soms per square meter and 3.2 soms per person per month (November 1994&#13;
rate)&#13;

The Power and Heat Sector                                                            15&#13;
E.    SOCIAL ASSESSMENT AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION&#13;
2.26  Social Impact Assessment. A social impact assessment of the proposed tariff increases&#13;
was carried out with the help of local consultants during project preparation and appraisal: a&#13;
brief summary is in Annex 2.6, and the full report is in the project file. The assessment was&#13;
based on: (a) in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions with concerned consumers, NG(O&#13;
representatives and government officials; (b) data from the Kyrgyz Republic Household Energy&#13;
Survey undertaken in October 1994 by the Energy Advisory Group (EU-TACIS) in conneclion&#13;
with the Bank's Energy Sector Review; and (c) a special household survey of consumers usinge&#13;
district heating in Bishkek carried out in June/July 1995. The surveys revealed somewhat higlher&#13;
income levels among the concerned population than generally assumed and allowed a better&#13;
assessment of people's ability to pay for energy, in particular electricity and various sources of&#13;
household heat and hot water (district heating, natural gas, coal, fuel wood and dung).&#13;
2.27  The findings of the assessment indicate that the proposed tariff increase for households&#13;
for electricity is feasible, while the increase for district heating is feasible only if a social satetv&#13;
net is introduced to protect low-income households. In parallel, households without access tO&#13;
district heating, and therefore relying on natural gas and coal for heat, also need protection. In&#13;
the case of electricity, the impact of the tariff increase could be mitigated through maintainin-&#13;
a reduced lifeline tariff of 100 to 150 kWh/month for residential consumers; this could be offset&#13;
by a slightly higher average tariff increase (perhaps 20 tyins/kWh, with 15 tyins/kWh for tle&#13;
lifeline tariff). At the same time, GOK agreed that KNEHC should terminate by Jul? 1, 1997.&#13;
all special discounts for household use of power and heat.&#13;
2.28  In the case of district heating, based on the social assessment and discussions with tlle&#13;
Government and other concerned groups, a proposed social safety net has been designed to: (a)&#13;
protect the poor and vulnerable groups of the population while ensuring that they pay what they&#13;
can afford; and (b) cause the higher income groups to pay the real cost of supply. A second&#13;
underlying principle is that KNEHC, which is expected to operate on a commercial basis, should&#13;
not be subsidizing the low-income consumers; rather this should be the responsibility of the&#13;
Government under the administration of agencies charged with and qualified to address suchi&#13;
social responsibilities. The amount of subsidy has been based on the principle that payments for&#13;
heat and hot water should not exceed 30% of household income. Based on the survey findings,&#13;
this means about 35% of households with access to district heating would require assistance in&#13;
paying their heating bills, amounting to an estimated annual cost to the Government of 56&#13;
million soms (US$ 5.1 million). Similar analyses were carried out for the population using&#13;
natural gas and coal for heating, for which the required subsidies are estimated respectively to&#13;
be 16 and 78 million soms. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection would be administering&#13;
the subsidy scheme in view of their experience in targeting low-income groups (including GOK's&#13;
on-going program of monthly income support benefitting households with incomes below 68&#13;
soms/month).6 In an effort to ensure payment goes to the suppliers of heat, the subsidy would&#13;
be provided in the form of coupons for use in paying heating and gas bills and purchasing coal.&#13;
A possible source of funding for the subsidy is a tax on power exports or an additional tax on&#13;
gasoline. To enable a gradual phasing out of such subsidies over time, energy conservation&#13;
measures, including inter alia consumer education, metering of hot water and improved building&#13;

insulation, will be addressed over the medium term. During negotiations, GOK agreed to fund&#13;
ind implement the social safety net program and, by October 31 of each year, review its&#13;
implementation with IDA.&#13;
F.    GOVERNMENT'S SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
2.29 Sector Reform, Restructuring, Commercialization and Privatization. As indicated in&#13;
Chapter 1 (para 1.16), a central element of the Government's post-independence policy for the&#13;
e:nergy sector has been restructuring energy entities to increase autonomy and self-sufficiency,&#13;
attracting private sector participation to improve efficiency and mobilize financing, and&#13;
estahblishing the necessary legal and regulatory framework. Consistent with these policies, GOK&#13;
has expressed interest in privatizing the power and heat sector and has considered various&#13;
options in this respect, one of which includes gradual privatization of KNEHC as a vertically&#13;
intetrated power and heat utility. At the urging of the Bank and other donors and as discussed&#13;
in the Bank's Energy Sector Review, GOK has decided to defer KNEHC's privatization until&#13;
the various options for restructuring the power and heat sector have been thoroughly analyzed&#13;
atnd the necessary steps precedent to privatization taken.&#13;
2 .30  'T'he absence of a legal and regulatory framework and weaknesses in the overall&#13;
orvanization of the energy sector have frustrated GOK's efforts to reorganize the power and heat&#13;
sector and privatize certain activities. Since 1994, however, under the aegis of EU-TACIS and&#13;
more recently with USAID-funded assistance, a framework energy law and an electricity law&#13;
have been drafted and submitted to Parliament. This new legislation will provide for licensing&#13;
and regulation of the power sector, thus helping to create an enabling environment for private&#13;
sector participation; the energy law will also provide for an independent regulatory agency that&#13;
would enforce the rights and obligations of the respective parties. In the meantime, the&#13;
regulatory agency has been created by a Government Act. Continuing assistance from USAID&#13;
will help GOK implement the new legislation, particularly in setting up, staffing and initiating&#13;
operation of the regulatory agency and preparation of secondary legislation. As introduction&#13;
(t' the legislation is considered critical to GOK's plans for sector reform, restructuring and&#13;
uiltimate privatization, enactment of the energy and electricity laws, satisfactory to IDA, is a&#13;
condition of effectiveness.&#13;
2.31   The power and heat sector in the Kyrgyz Republic has been operated by a single,&#13;
vertically integrated entity for more than thirty years. Consideration needs to be given to&#13;
alternative structures for the sector and possible privatization. Separation of electricity and&#13;
district heating activities, and unbundling of power into generation, transmission and distribution&#13;
activities should be among the restructuring options to be considered.  Divestiture of&#13;
assets/activities and scope for private sector participation, including independent power producers&#13;
and local distributors of electricity and district heating, should also be considered. Privatization&#13;
of the distribution entities seems worth pursuing. Assistance in formulating such a long-term&#13;
strategy for restructuring the power and heat sector and opening it to private investment will be&#13;
provided under the proposed project in conjunction with USAID.&#13;
2.32  True commercialization and financial and corporate restructuring of KNEHC are essential&#13;
steps in the utility's transition from a centralized system to a market economy and in its&#13;
preparation for privatization. Under Japanese Economic Cooperation Fund (JECF) financing,&#13;
F3BRD is assisting KNEHC to establish a commercial management system; ADB is grant-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Power and Heat Sector                                                          17&#13;
financing a tariff study and assistance to KNEHC in tariff setting (para 2.25); under the&#13;
proposed project, IDA is providing assistance in setting up a consumer billing and management&#13;
system; the Energy Advisory Group funded by EU-TACIS has also provided various assistance&#13;
concerning KNEHC's commercialization.&#13;
2.33  Energy Policy. Faced with sharply rising prices for imported energy and a desire to be&#13;
self-sufficient, the Kyrgyz Government has stressed increased reliance on indigenous energy&#13;
supplies and development of its domestic resources. However, the Government's present policy&#13;
of converting residential and commercial consumers to electrical heating, because electricity is&#13;
an indigenous resource, is misguided and costly to the economy because: (a) electrical heating&#13;
costs about three times that of heating with coal or natural gas (Annex 2. 7); (b) the power&#13;
transmission and distribution system is being seriously overloaded and requires rehabilitation and&#13;
expansion to carry the additional load (which comes at the time of peak demand); (c) the&#13;
domestic coal industry is being hurt by the policy; and (d) domestic power consumption would&#13;
displace exports. Adjustment of electricity tariffs to cover the full cost of supply and subsequent&#13;
elimination of distortions among relative energy prices should assist consumers in making the&#13;
proper economic choice for heating. The need to temper its policy promoting domestic use of&#13;
electricity with economy and efficiency considerations was discussed with GOKIKNEHC during&#13;
appraisal; assurances to this effect were given by GOK.&#13;
2.34  Regional trade will continue to be critically important to the Kyrgyz Republic, as it is a&#13;
small land-locked country and is fully integrated with its neighboring countries. The trade-offs&#13;
between competing electricity and irrigation needs for water, as well as the trade of natural gas,&#13;
petroleum products and coal, pose important challenges to regional economic cooperation.&#13;
Efforts to improve its energy trade arrangements and negotiate longer term contracts with more&#13;
equitable sharing of benefits will continue to be a priority for the Kyrgyz Government.&#13;
Hydropower exports represent a potential growth area for the economy provided markets can&#13;
be arranged on secure and profitable conditions. USAID is providing some assistance in this&#13;
area on a regional basis through market studies and a proposed series of conferences on energy&#13;
and related issues involving participants from the five Central Asian republics; the Bank will also&#13;
participate in these conferences. ADB is also providing assistance on regional market studies.&#13;
G.    BANK'S ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND EXPERIENCE&#13;
2.35 Bank's Role and Assistance Strategy. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on June 28, 1995. The&#13;
Bank's FY96-98 CAS has been designed to reflect the country's evolving needs and priorities.&#13;
The basic objectives of the Bank's strategy are to: (a) facilitate restoration of growth; (b) support&#13;
consolidation of structural reform efforts; (c) assist GOK in protecting the most vulnerable&#13;
segments of society during the transition; and (d) strengthen institutional capacity. Within these&#13;
goals, energy has been identified as one of four priority areas for Bank financial and technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
2.36 In energy, as in other sectors, GOK has shown a firm commitment to reform and looks&#13;
to the Bank for guidance and assistance. The reform agenda outlined in the Bank's Energy&#13;
Sector Review prepared in 1994 (para 1.2) is generally consistent with the Government's post-&#13;
independence energy policy, and actions have been initiated on several fronts with assistance&#13;
from the Bank and other donors. The Bank's overall role in the sector is to assist in: (a)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                 The Power and Heat Sector&#13;
implementing priority policy measures identified in the Energy Sector Review; (b) increasing&#13;
sector efficiency and sustainability; (c) coordinating donor funding; and (d) providing investment&#13;
resources. Through the proposed project, the Bank, together with ADB, DANIDA, EBRD,&#13;
Nordic Development Fund, Switzerland, USAID and possibly other donors, will assist the&#13;
Government and KNEHC in: (a) strengthening sector policy formulation and management,&#13;
establishing a suitable regulatory framework, and restructuring and commercializing KNEHC&#13;
with a view to future private participation in the power and heat sector; and (b) carrying out&#13;
priority rehabilitation and upgrading of the CHP plant and district heating system in Bishkek and&#13;
the transmission and distribution system  in the northern part of the country.  Continued&#13;
assistance to the sector is planned under a subsequent lending operation which would support&#13;
inter alia retrofitting of existing hydropower facilities. The Bank's involvement at the regional&#13;
level in the Aral Sea Program should promote regional cooperation and could create favorable&#13;
conditions for optimal use of water resources from which the Kyrgyz Republic could benefit if&#13;
power exports could be increased. Further discussion of regional trade issues, particularly the&#13;
potential for power exports, may be appropriate in the context of the second project.&#13;
2.37 Past Experience and Lessons Learned. The main problems encountered in the Bank's&#13;
first three years of lending operations in the Kyrgyz Republic have been delays in procurement&#13;
(particularly of technical assistance and consultant services), inadequate counterpart funding and&#13;
shortage of qualified local staff. The proposed project would be the first lending operation in&#13;
the Kyrgyz Republic in the energy sector but, within the context of the Rehabilitation Credit (Cr.&#13;
2491-KG), KNEHC was exposed to some extent to Bank processes and procedures. Early&#13;
establishment of the Project Implementation Unit and staffing it with international experts to&#13;
assist in development and tendering of bid documents should help minimize start-up delays;&#13;
terms of reference for key technical assistance activities have been agreed. The availability of&#13;
counterpart funds and local staff for project implementation have been discussed during&#13;
appraisal; tariff adjustments, together with other measures addressing KNEHC's overall financial&#13;
performance, and training of local staff will be carried out under the project.&#13;
2.38 In preparing the proposed project, lessons learned from the Bank Group's power and&#13;
energy experience world-wide have been taken into consideration. Particular attention has been&#13;
given to ensuring that the main preparatory work required for project implementation is done&#13;
prior to credit effectiveness. Moreover, the project design and related technical assistance take&#13;
into account the principal recommendations of the present Bank policy7. The Government is&#13;
committed to reforming state enterprises and moving from centrally planned to market-oriented&#13;
mechanisms. A first important step in this direction in the power and heat sector will be&#13;
adjusting tariffs to market prices.  The project also supports introduction of a transparent&#13;
regulatory process into the power and heat sector, preparation of a strategy for restructuring and&#13;
ultimately privatizing the sector, and initiating this process through restructuring and&#13;
commercialization of the power and heat utility. Investments under the project will lead to&#13;
improved energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. THE BENEFICIARY&#13;
A.    INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
3.1   The power and heat sectors have historically been owned and operated by one entity&#13;
formed initially in 1963 by the Ministry of Energy of the Soviet Union. In April 1992, following&#13;
a Presidential Resolution, it adopted the name of the Kyrgyz State Electricity Company (KSEC).&#13;
Early 1994, its name was changed to that of the Kyrgyz National Energy Holding Company&#13;
(KNEHC). The articles of association of KNEHC', are unusual in that they concentrate most of&#13;
the powers with the President of the Company. The Board, which is made up exclusively of&#13;
KNEHC personnel appointed by the President, has limited authority.&#13;
3.2    As can be seen at Annex 3. 1, KNEHC operates through twenty one "enterprises" of which&#13;
sixteen are entrusted with power generation, transmission and distribution, district heating,&#13;
operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), stores and training - these are the "core enterprises"; and five&#13;
"enterprises" are engaged in training, design and research, construction and steel frames&#13;
manufacturing.&#13;
3.3    KNEHC functions, for all practical purposes, as the headquarters of a single utility and&#13;
not as a holding company managing a portfolio of investments in subsidiaries. Its organization&#13;
chart appears at Annex 3.2. In addition to the heads of the enterprises, eleven individuals report&#13;
to the President of the company, including two Vice Presidents (one in charge of technical&#13;
operations, the other of administrative and commercial aspects); four Executive Directors&#13;
overseeing capital construction, external affairs, development planning and capital construction;&#13;
and five Department Heads in charge of fairly small units (personnel, accounting, economic&#13;
matters, finance, security). This structure is unusual in that a large number of individuals report&#13;
to the President. Furthermore, units that one would normally find under one vice presidency in&#13;
other utilities (finance, accounting, commercial, economic matters) are spread in KNEHC's case&#13;
to an unreasonable number of units, which is not conducive to efficient decision making.&#13;
3.4   The Government has expressed the desire to privatize the power sector, and some plans&#13;
were formulated in this respect. However, it now recognizes that the specific nature of the power&#13;
and heat businesses is such that considerable preparatory work is required prior to privatizing.&#13;
Given: (i) the unusual set up of KNEHC as a holding company; (ii) the centralized organizational&#13;
structure; and (iii) the necessity to streamline and commercialize the company operations prior&#13;
to its privatization, it is proposed to undertake, under the proposed project, an organization study.&#13;
With respect to the formulation of an appropriate strategy, the proposed study will help the&#13;
Government identify the various options at its disposal for power sector restructuring, and&#13;
subsequently assist the authorities in implementing the agreed recommendations. With respect to&#13;
KNEHC, the study will examine inter alia: (i) the by-laws of KNEHC; (ii) the organization of&#13;
the company and its subsidiaries; (iii) the financial structure and performance, including the&#13;
establishment of financial goals and the feasibility of converting equity into debt; (iv) the&#13;
upgrading of the personnel management function; and (v) the introduction of a management&#13;
information system. During negotiations, assurances were given that: (i) by September 30, 1996,&#13;
GOK will carry out a study of the organization the power and heat sector with assistance from&#13;
USAID-financed consultants; (ii) the recommendations of the organization study and&#13;
I  A copy of the articles, dated January 20, 1994, is in the Project File.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                                                       The Beneficiary&#13;
implementation plan for such recommendations will be reviewed with IDA; and (iii) immediately&#13;
after the review, KNEHC will appoint consultants to assist in carrying out the implementation&#13;
plan for such recommendations in accordance with Terms of Reference satisfactory to IDA. The&#13;
Terms of Reference for the organization study, to be initially funded by USAID, are presented&#13;
in Annex 3.3.&#13;
B.    STAFFING&#13;
3.5    KNEHC and its "enterprises" employ altogether some 15,200 staff of which about 25%&#13;
are professional, and the balance, technicians and laborers. Given the scope of activities of&#13;
KNEHC, the company is considerably overstaffed by western standards. Apparently, staff size&#13;
corresponds to the norms in effect in the FSU; this implies inter alia that for every senior&#13;
position, there is a "back-up" candidate should the senior position become vacant for one reason&#13;
or another. This can also be explained by the large number of construction personnel now idle,&#13;
the relatively low level of computerization, and excessive parceling of job descriptions. At the&#13;
same time, the company lacks personnel with experience in the modern tools of power system&#13;
planning, load management, power economics, tariff setting, data processing, international&#13;
contracts, etc.  The personnel management issues at KNEHC will be studied under the&#13;
organization study (para. 3.4).&#13;
C.    TRAINING&#13;
3.6   The company recruits graduates of vocational schools who are assigned to training&#13;
programs in the different skills required for the company at KNEHC facilities. Once they&#13;
successfullv complete the program, they are assigned to one of the "enterprises" of the group (the&#13;
"enterprises" do not recruit directly senior personnel). Regarding engineers, of whom 25 are&#13;
recruited annually, selected candidates have their studies paid for by KNEHC.&#13;
3.7   In addition to the training of young recruits, the company operates an in-house training&#13;
program. Furthermore, under the aegis of EU-TACIS and USAID, training programs particularly&#13;
for the upper management level personnel have been initiated. Nevertheless, the overall scope&#13;
of KNEHC's training needs and priorities remain to be established. It is therefore proposed under&#13;
the project to provide for: (i) a consultancy aimed at formulating KNEHC's training needs and&#13;
priorities over the coming three years. including the areas less emphasized in the past (accounting&#13;
and auditing, commercial function, financial management, international power contracts, power&#13;
planning etc.); and (ii) the implementation of the first phase of the training program.&#13;
D.    CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT, BILLING AND COLLECTION&#13;
3.8    Until recently, all electricity connections were metered. In the past year, however, as a&#13;
result of the campaign to enhance electricity use (some 120,000 customers were connected over&#13;
1993-94), an unknown number of connections was added, without being metered2. In view of the&#13;
detrimental impact of unmetered connections on the financial well-being of the utility, assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations (i) that, starting January 1, 1997, new meters will be owned by&#13;
KNEHC, and will be paid for through a monthly fee, and (ii) by January 1998, KNEHC will&#13;
2  In the Kyrgyz Republic, unlike most countries, new customers have now to finance or provide the meter&#13;
when connected to the grid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Beneficiay                                                                     21&#13;
ensure that all power consumers are appropriately metered. Residential customers are expected&#13;
to read their meters on a monthly basis, bring the records to a bank (or a KNEHC cash office)&#13;
and make the appropriate payment. Inspectors from KNEHC ensure that payment obligations are&#13;
complied with. The meters of industrial customers are read on a monthly basis, and a bill is&#13;
issued accordingly.&#13;
3.9    Regarding district heating, household and commercial customers are not metered -&#13;
payments are related to the size of the premises for heat and to the number of persons for hot&#13;
water. Domestic customers are usually grouped into buildings, and payments are made on a&#13;
collective basis. As for industrial consumers, they are metered and billed monthly.&#13;
3.10  Given the rapidly increasing energy costs, there has been a deterioration in the recovery&#13;
of payments, so much so that in March 1995, the President of KNEHC issued instructions&#13;
providing, inter alia, for monthly meter reading and billing, accelerated payment transfers and&#13;
improved monitoring of cash collections. These efforts are showing results, with an increasing&#13;
number of customers being disconnected on account of non-payment. Further, during August&#13;
1995, the Government settled its debt, and those of the administration, against the taxes due by&#13;
KNEHC.&#13;
3.11  Technical assistance, of limited scope, has been provided in the past (by EU-TACIS and&#13;
USAID) to improve KNEHC's performance in billing and collection. Under the project, it is&#13;
proposed to finance a technical assistance program designed to investigate the whole billing cycle&#13;
in the main areas where KNEHC supplies electricity and heat, and develop and initiate&#13;
implementation of an improved customer billing and management system. Assurances were&#13;
obtained during negotiations that: (i) by December 31, 1996, KNEHC will appoint a consultant&#13;
to carry out the billing and collection study in accordance with terms of reference attached in&#13;
Annex 3.4; (ii) reviewf with IDA the findings and recommendations of the study; and (iii)&#13;
implement the agreed recommendations.&#13;
E.    ACCOUNTS AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.12  KR follows the FSU code of accounts, which is different from  the International&#13;
Accounting Standards (IAS). Further, the Ministry of Finance issues annually detailed instructions&#13;
regarding the presentation of accounts. Financial statements are prepared on a quarterly basis -&#13;
the initial financial statements are prepared by the "enterprises", and these are subsequently&#13;
consolidated by KNEHC. Accounts are produced remarkably fast, within 15 days from the end&#13;
of the period by the "enterprises", and within 25 days by KNEHC.&#13;
3.13   KNEHC is not equipped with a modern management information system, or for that&#13;
matter, a budgetary control system. Further, there is no costing system which would enable the&#13;
management to take rational decisions from a financial standpoint. This seems to be due to the&#13;
framework under which the utility operated previously, in which such matters were not&#13;
emphasized. Lastly, the company is under equipped in computing equipment. As a result,&#13;
essential decisions are not supported by documented analyses of their financial implications.&#13;
Under the circumstances, the upgrading of the accounting and financial functions represents a&#13;
high priority and a particularly challenging task which is considered critical for the future&#13;
development of the utility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                                                          The Beneficiary&#13;
3.14   Under the aegis of EBRD, an international consultant is at present: (i) investigating the&#13;
existing accounting practices, management information and financial systems; (ii) designing new&#13;
systems of reporting, accounting manuals, procedures, costing, management information; and (iii)&#13;
assisting in the implementation of the new systems. Further, the consultant will provide training,&#13;
transfer know how, assist in the preparation of the 1995 accounts in accordance with IAS, assist&#13;
in the revaluation of assets, and more generally, assist KNEHC staff in managing its finances.&#13;
In view of the critical importance of this consultancy to the improvement/ modernization of&#13;
KNEHC's financial systems, Bank staff, in liaison with EBRD, have been monitoring progress,&#13;
and providing inputs, as necessary.&#13;
F.    AUDIT&#13;
3.15   Accounts of State "enterprises" are not subject to an external audit - the tax authorities&#13;
do their own review, but it cannot be construed as a full audit in line with the IDA's&#13;
requirements. Consistently with agreements reached previously with EBRD, during negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained that, from FYI 996 onwards, the accounts of KNEHC and those of its&#13;
subsidiaries will be subject to an independent annual audit by an audit firm acceptable to IDA,&#13;
and that the results of such audit will be submitted to IDA not later than 6 months from the end&#13;
of the fiscal year.&#13;
G.    INSURANCE&#13;
3.16   KNEHC's power plants, transmission lines, distribution systems, vehicles, are not insured&#13;
at present. This is due to the absence of an insurance industry in the Kyrgyz Republic. The lack&#13;
of insurance coverage represents a serious risk for KNEHC given its limited resources. At&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that KNEHC will take out and maintain appropriate&#13;
insurance. As a first step in this respect, a consultant will undertake a risk assessment study to&#13;
identify the assurance requirements of the utility.3&#13;
3  The risk assessment will be carried out following a revaluation of assets to be conducted with a tariff study&#13;
(paras. 2.24 and 5.11 )&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.1   The main objectives of the proposed Project are to support economic growth through&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                                                    The Project&#13;
C.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
a.     Part-A. Rehabilitation of the Bishkek combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plant - TES-1.&#13;
4.3    As indicated in para 2.11, the Bishkek TES-I plant need to be refurbished. The overall&#13;
efficiency of the plant in co-generation of power and heat mode of about 70% could be improved&#13;
through retrofitting better instrumentation and control and refurbishment of boilers. Further the&#13;
installed capacity could be increased by commissioning the 90 MW turbine (Turbine-I 1)&#13;
purchased from Russia and currently in storage. The proposed Project will provide for the&#13;
refurbishment of seven most recent boilers; installation of Turbine-I 1, upgrading of the plant&#13;
instrumentation and control systems and retrofitting of the essential auxiliary system (coal supply,&#13;
water make up, compressed air, electrostatic precipitators); installation of monitoring devices for&#13;
emissions (S02, NOx, etc.); and provision for a metal testing laboratory and vibration monitoring&#13;
equipment.&#13;
h.     Part-B. District heating system rehabilitation in Bishkek&#13;
4.4    As indicated in para 2.16, the proposed project would: (a) rehabilitate the DH network&#13;
through replacement of the most corroded network sections (about 12.5 kin) with pre-insulated&#13;
pipe to seal leaks and reduce internal corrosion, and replace damaged and poor insulation of the&#13;
aerial sections of the network (about 7 km); (b) modernize the DH system by introducing variable&#13;
flow into the system through the installation of frequency converters on selected pumps and by&#13;
retrofitting the automatic control system necessary to get full benefit of the variable flow&#13;
operation; and (c) modernize substations to adapt to variable flow operation and install hcat&#13;
meters.&#13;
c.     Part-C. Rehabilitation and upgrading of the transmission and distrihulion Jacilitie.s.&#13;
4.5    The recent increase in electricity demand has subjected the transmission and distribution&#13;
infrastructure to severe overload. Further, about 60% of the substation equipment in Bishkek has&#13;
accumulated over 25 years of operation, is currently obsolete and prone to failure creating power&#13;
outages and safety hazards. The proposed project would finance: (a) construction of a new&#13;
220/1 10-kV Ala Archa substation to improve power supply to Bishkek and reduce losses; (b)&#13;
connection at 220-kV of the Chui substation to improve supply in the area; (c) replacement of&#13;
the 11 0-kV ground circuit breakers for 12 substations in Bishkek; (d) upgrading the substations&#13;
of Novo-Troitskaia (1 10/35/10-kV), Orto Alysh (1 10/35/10-kV), Selektsionnaia (1 10/10-kV) and&#13;
Sel' elecktro (35/10-kV); (e) construction of a new 220/1 10-kV substation at Naryn;' and (f)&#13;
provision for metering equipment and tools.&#13;
d      Part D. Technical support and training.&#13;
Construction of the 220/1 10-kV Naryn substation would provide a permanent supply to Naryn region at&#13;
220-kV (instead of I 10-kV) and drastically improve the supply to Kumtor Gold Mine and Issyk-Kul and Naryn&#13;
regions. The following upstream investments of about US$6 million are being carried out under an EBRD-&#13;
financed operation: (a) completion of the remaining 47 km of the 220-kV transmission line Kemin-Naryn; (b)&#13;
provision of a 220-kV bay at Kemin; and (c) construction of a provisional 220/1 10-kV substation at Naryn.&#13;
These works are expected to be commissioned by end 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                      25&#13;
4.6   Consulting Services for Project Management and Training. Based on detailed evaluationi&#13;
on the needs of KNEHC, provision has been made in the project for consulting services to assist&#13;
in engineering, design, procurement and construction supervision and training lor the&#13;
establishment and functioning of the PIU (50 SM). The first phase of detailed design and&#13;
preparation of bidding documents is being financed under the Swiss and Danish Consultant Trust&#13;
Funds. Terms of reference for project management consultant services are given in Annex 4.2.&#13;
4.7   Technical Assistance for Power Sector Reform and Institutional Strengthening. To meet&#13;
Government's objectives of reforming the power sector and moving from centrally plained to&#13;
market economy, two technical assistance initiatives are being provided. The first, being financed&#13;
by USAID is focused on reforming the power sector for future private sector involvement (para.&#13;
3.4). This effort is based on the principles of (a) improving the operational efficiency of the&#13;
sector; (b) commercialization and corporatization of the power and heat operations to provide&#13;
greater managerial and financial autonomy; and (c) developing an appropriate legal and regulator)&#13;
framework that would allow for greater enterprise autonomy and requisite Government oversiglht.&#13;
4.8   The second technical assistance under the project, directed at much needed institutional&#13;
strengthening and would focus on the development of appropriate organizational structules.&#13;
adoption of commercial management practices, budget and control systems, reporting procedures&#13;
and a management information system in coordination with actions provided by other donors&#13;
(para 2.12 and 3.14). In particular, the proposed project would also include the setting ulp of&#13;
improved billing and collections system, and a risk assessment and insurance study. Lastly&#13;
training will be provided to KNEHC staff in priority areas to be defined separately (para. 3.7).&#13;
e.    Part-E. Petroleum Exploration Promotion.&#13;
4.9   A detailed assessment and reprocessing of the existing geological and geophysical data&#13;
is being carried out under a Japanese Grant Facility. A Petroleum law, a model contract and a&#13;
fiscal regime are being prepared under the Norwegian Trust Fund. The proposed project would&#13;
build on the previous studies and include technical assistance for the preparation of petroleuni&#13;
data packages and the execution of a promotional program of the most promising Kyrgyz basins.&#13;
Terms of reference for this technical assistance action are given in Annex 4v3.&#13;
D.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.10  KNEHC would be responsible for implementing the power and heat components. A&#13;
working group at the level of Government, chaired by the State Property Fund, will be set up to&#13;
supervise the USAID-financed institutional reform studies in the power and heat sector. Adequate&#13;
consulting assistance is being provided to assist KNEHC in preparing bidding documents,&#13;
evaluating bids, awarding the main contracts, preparing evaluation reports, project management&#13;
including project supervision and progress reporting. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will&#13;
be set up to carry out procurement operations, coordination, reporting and disbursement for all&#13;
three components. During appraisal agreement was reached with KNEHC on the staffing and the&#13;
equipment needs for the PIU as indicated in Annex 4.4. During negotiations KNEHC agreed to&#13;
provide adequate staffing and office space for the PIU to ensure an efficient implementation of&#13;
the project.&#13;

26                                                                        The Project&#13;
4.1 1  The Petroleum  Exploration  Promotion  component would  be implemented  by&#13;
Goskomgeologia once the ongoing work on data collection and reprocessing has been&#13;
satisfactorily completed. Goskomgeologia will be assisted by a consulting firm having experience&#13;
in the promotion of petroleum exploration on the international market. A condition of&#13;
dishbursement for this component would be the enactment of appropriate legislation for petroleum&#13;
exploration and development, and the introduction of an appropriate fiscal regime.&#13;
4.12  The project implementation schedule including the key target dates is given in Annex 4.5.&#13;
IThe major portion of the project implementation will be over the 1996-1999 period. Design and&#13;
preparation of bidding documents is on the critical path of project implementation. Consulting&#13;
services for the engineering design and the PIU are expected to start in April 1996. Most of the&#13;
bidding process is expected to be completed for all internationally procured goods and services&#13;
by end 1996. KNEHC has technically well experienced staff and with the expatriate consulting&#13;
assistance provided under the project, no substantive problems are foreseen in efficient and timely&#13;
implementationi of the project.&#13;
E.    MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
4.13  Procedures for monitoring the progress of the project in terms of physical execution and&#13;
finanicial reporting have been discussed during appraisal and agreed during negotiations. The PIU&#13;
will prepare quarterly progress reports and an annual report for each project component. The&#13;
progress reports will include, but not necessarily be limited to, project physical progress,&#13;
procurement, disbursement, project costs, schedule, plan for the next reporting period. The&#13;
progress report will be sent to IDA and other co-financiers within 30 days after the end of the&#13;
reportinig period (first progress report will be due three months after the credit effectiveness).&#13;
4.14  An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be drafted by IDA not later than six&#13;
mzonths after closing of the credit. KNEHC will also prepare and make available to IDA its own&#13;
evaluation report, including a summary report which will be attached unedited to the ICR. The&#13;
evaluationi would assess the project execution and initial operation, its costs and benefits, IDA's&#13;
perfornmance, KNEHC's own performance of its obligations and the extent to which the purposes&#13;
ol the Credit were achieved.&#13;
F.    SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
4.15  Supervision of this project will extend over the implementation period and would be&#13;
closely coordinated with the other co-financiers. The key issues that would be focused upon are:&#13;
(a) review of progress in the restructuring of the sector and KNEHC; (b) continuing the dialogue&#13;
with the Government on the tariffs for the power and district heating sector; (c) monitoring the&#13;
fmiancial performance of KNEHC to ensure compliance with financial covenants; and (d)&#13;
technical supervision of physical implementation of the project components. The reviews will be&#13;
undertaken jointly with Government representatives. The Government will submit a mid-term&#13;
progress report, covering all components of the project no later than June 30, 1998. In addition&#13;
to the topics covered in the quarterly reports, the mid-term report will include an assessment of&#13;
the status of the credit covenants, the institutional performance of KNEHC, and evaluation of the&#13;
project based on a set of performance indicators (Annex 4.6). During negotiations, it was agreed&#13;
thal the mid-term review will take place by September 30, 1998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                        27&#13;
4.16   Supervision of the project would require expertise in power engineering, economics,&#13;
financial analysis and procurement. Three missions annually for a period of three years (normally&#13;
coinciding with preparatory missions for future IDA-financed projects) are foreseen for adequate&#13;
supervision of the project. Owing to limited experience of the beneficiary with Bank procurement&#13;
rules, the project is expected to require a supervision effort from the Bank at an average of 18&#13;
staff-weeks the first year, 12 staff-weeks the second year, and thereafter, 10 staff-weeks per year.&#13;
G.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
4.17  The impact of three project components, Bishkek CHP, DH and T&amp;D networks&#13;
rehabilitation (environmental category B) was assessed in the course of the preparation of the&#13;
feasibility study and an environmental analysis was carried out during appraisal.  During&#13;
negotiations KNEHC agreed on the implementation of the environmental management plan&#13;
attachedl in Annex 4.7 and submission to IDA of the reports required under such plan.&#13;
4.18  Biishkek (CHP Rehahilitation. The review revealed that (a) the lack of automatic controls&#13;
leads to losses and high emissions; emissions of S02, NOx and fly ash are not monitored;&#13;
because the coal used has low sulphur content, emissions of S02 do not present a major problem;&#13;
fly-ash emissionis could be reduced by better maintenance of the scrubbers and electrostatic&#13;
precipitators, and connecting in the future all the boilers to the 300-meter high stack; (b) the&#13;
control ot cxcess air in combustion is very difficult because of uncontrolled air leaking through&#13;
the boiler walls; (c) measures need to be implemented to reduce the impact of the ash dump on&#13;
the environment, and (d) asbestos has been used as an insulating material; therefore, measures&#13;
need to be taken to minimize the risks to workers involved in the removal of this material. The&#13;
project would address most of these issues: much of the obsolete instrumentation and control&#13;
equipment will be replaced. The refurbishment of boilers will reduce air leaks; equipment to&#13;
monitor environmental emissions will be provided. In addition, steps need to be taken to assure&#13;
that asbestos is safely removed and disposed of, in consultation with environmental authorities.&#13;
Under the proposed Project technical assistance would be provided to Goskompriroda for the&#13;
preparation of asbestos disposal and management guidelines. Hence, when implemented, this&#13;
component would have a favorable environmental impact.&#13;
4.19  DII rehabilitation and modernization. Implementation of the proposed component is&#13;
anticipated to have positive environmental benefits through improved efficiency in the use of&#13;
fuels and reduction of water losses in the DH system. The energy efficiency would result from&#13;
a better integration of the DH system and an increased use of the Bishkek CHP as a source of&#13;
heat, leaving the HOBs for peaking use only. The environmental review assessed potential&#13;
impacts associated with waste disposal. In the older parts of the DH network, asbestos has been&#13;
used as an insulating material; therefore, measures need to be taken to minimize the risks to&#13;
workers involved in the removal of this material.&#13;
4.20   T&amp;D network rehabilitation. Except for the Ala Archa and Naryn substations, all of the&#13;
work to be undertaken is within existing facilities and would not pose any environmental issues.&#13;
The site of the new Ala Archa substation is outside the city and would not present any&#13;
environmental issue. The site of the Naryn substation is located in a rural area. Rehabilitation&#13;
of obsolete and out of repair equipment would contribute to greater safety for the workers and&#13;
the public. There will be no resettlement issue associated with the project. Analyses of two&#13;
samples of transformer oil were performed in Switzerland and the US and no PCB was found.&#13;

H.      PROJECT COST ESTIMATE&#13;
4.21   The total cost of the project (including capitalized interest during construction) is&#13;
estimated at US$ 98.5 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$ 72.3 million. Physical&#13;
contingencies are 10% of the base cost for all project components. Price contingencies are&#13;
estimated on the basis of escalation factors of 28.7%  in 1995, 15%  in 1996, 9%  in 1997, 4.1%&#13;
in 1998, and 2.6% in 1999 and thereafter for the local cost; 6.9% in 1995, 3.3% in 1996, 2.3%&#13;
in 1997, 2.5% in 1998 and thereafter for the foreign cost. Table 4.1 summarizes the cost&#13;
estimate for the project. Detailed cost tables for the project components are given in Annex 4.8.&#13;
These costs do not include import duties and taxes of which the project is exempted.&#13;

I.     FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.22   The proposed financing by IDA, ADB, Danida NDFand the Swiss Government of about&#13;
US$69.9 million would finance the following components:&#13;
(a)     IDA            (i)     Rehabilitation of the Bishkek thermal plant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

It is assumed that the Government would provide a loan to KNEHC to finance the cost of IDC&#13;
on the Subsidiary Loans;&#13;
Of which US$2.3 million represent the cost of Turbine 11 already purchased from Russia but not&#13;
paid for and US$1.3 million represent IDC on the foreign loans and credits.&#13;
4.24   The IDA  credit of US$ 20 million equivalent would meet about 28%  of the foreign&#13;
exchange cost of the project and about 20% of the project financing requirements. ADB would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                                        The Project&#13;
provide a loan of US$ 30 million denominated in SDRs that would have a repayment period of&#13;
40 years, including a grace period of ten years, and would carry a service charge of 1% per&#13;
annum. DANIDA would provide a mixed credit of US$ 8.6 million equivalent, with a grace&#13;
period of one year and a repayment period of 8 to 9 years at no interest; the credit is subject to&#13;
15% down payment (expected to be funded by NDF) and will carry an export credit premium&#13;
and banking fees plus interest at CIRR rate during the draw down period.  The Nordic&#13;
Development Fund would consider providing a credit of about US$ 6.8 million equivalent on&#13;
IDA terms. The Swiss Government would provide a US$4.5 million grant. Part of the IDA credit&#13;
will be on-lent to KNEHC under terms agreed during negotiation (interest rate equal to the&#13;
prevailing IBRD lending rate, with KNEHC bearing the foreign exchange risk, and a repayment&#13;
period of 15 years including 4-year grace period). The conclusion of the subsidiary loan&#13;
agreement between the Government and KNEHC would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA&#13;
credit. Also, IDA could invoke its remedies if, by December 31, 1996, the effectiveness of the&#13;
ADB and DANIDA loans, NDF credit, and the Swviss grant is not obtained by December 31,&#13;
1996.&#13;
J.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.25  Procurement will be administered by KNEHC with assistance from  international&#13;
consultants in the PIU, whose responsibility will include: (a) training of selected local staff and&#13;
developing monitoring procedures for their use in managing procurement and disbursement; (b)&#13;
assisting with preparing specific bidding documents based on the Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for the lots financed by IDA; (c) participating in the evaluation of bids and proposals&#13;
received and in the preparation of evaluation reports; and (d) advising on contracts with&#13;
successful bidders and consultants. While the staff of the PIU initially may be inexperienced with&#13;
IDA procurement guidelines, the foreign consultants engaged to assist them should minimize&#13;
potential procurement problems and excessive delays. Procurement information will be collected&#13;
and reported by the PIU to IDA and other co-financiers for each contract award. In addition,&#13;
information on the status of procurement under the project will be reported quarterly.&#13;
4.26  All goods and works to be financed from the IDA credit proceeds would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines (January 1995). Procurement of goods and services&#13;
financed by ADB will follow ADB's Procurement Guidelines. Goods and services financed by&#13;
DANIDA will be procured within Denmark. Goods and services financed by NDF would be&#13;
procured within the Nordic countries. Goods and services financed under the Swiss grant will&#13;
be procured within Switzerland. Consultant services financed by IDA for: (a) developing a&#13;
computerized Billing and Collection System; (b) implementing the organizational restructuring&#13;
and commercialization of the heat and power sector; (c) assisting the PIU in project&#13;
implementation and supervision; (d) provision of training; and (e) preparation of a Petroleum&#13;
Exploration promotion will be hired through Short Listing, in accordance with the World Bank&#13;
Guideline for the Use of Consultants. For goods and services financed by the IDA credit and&#13;
procured under ICB, the World Bank Standard Bidding Documents will be used.&#13;
4.27  The equipment, goods and services, with a total value of about US$ 65 million will be&#13;
procured in 17 packages ranging in value from US$ 0.3 million to about US$ 12 million. The&#13;
bid packages will be on the basis of supply-and-erect contracts for the main categories of&#13;
equipment. Equipment financed by IDA and procured through ICB would account for about&#13;
22% of all equipment requirements and consist of 7 packages of which four packages would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                                                      31&#13;
supply and installation. Prequalification of suppliers is recommended for these four packages.&#13;
In the evaluation and comparison of bids for equipment financed by IDA and to be procured&#13;
through ICB, Kyrgyz manufacturers would receive a domestic preference in bid evaluation in&#13;
accordance with paras 2.54, 2.55 and Appendix 2 of the Bank's Guidelines.    Procurement&#13;
arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3. A detailed procurement plan and schedule are shown&#13;

(including testing and measuring equipment) using International Shopping (IS) aggregating 0.4&#13;
million in compliance with Bank Guidelines. Contracts under this procedure will not exceed&#13;
50,000 each for IS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                                        The Project&#13;
4.29  Prior review by IDA will be required for all prequalification procedures and good&#13;
contracts procured under ICB and IS. Also prior review by IDA will be required for consultant&#13;
contracts with firms over US$100,000 equivalent. Terms of reference for all consultancies will&#13;
be pre-reviewed by IDA.&#13;
4.30  Local contracts for installation would not be financed from the IDA credit. The installation&#13;
work for transmission and distribution system rehabilitation will be carried out on force account&#13;
basis using KNEHC's resources. This personnel have long experience of executing installation&#13;
work of this nature. For the Bishkek TES power plant refurbishment and the DH network&#13;
upgrading, local installation will be carried out by local contractors and KNEHC staff under close&#13;
supervision and guidance by the foreign suppliers.&#13;
K.   DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.31  The IDA credit would be disbursed against: (a) for goods, 100% of foreign expenditures,&#13;
100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 80% of local expenditures for items previously&#13;
imported but procured locally; and (b) for consulting services, 100% of expenditures excluding&#13;
taxes. As no contract is expected to be less than about US$200,000 equivalent (except for a few&#13;
contracts under IS procedures), Statement of Expenditures will not be followed. To facilitate&#13;
disbursement, a Special Account would be established in US currency for KNEHC on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA with deposits of US$ 0.5 million, but the initial deposit would be&#13;
limited to US$100,000 until withdrawals from the Credit Account have reached US$1 million.&#13;
Replenishment applications should be submitted monthly or when the account is drawn by 30%&#13;
of the authorized allocation, whichever occurs first. For withdrawal outside the Special Account&#13;
(application for direct payment or for issuance of Special Commitment) a minimum value of 20%&#13;
of the authorized allocation of the Special Account will be observed.&#13;
4.32  The accounting of all Special Account transactions and for all project-related accounts will&#13;
be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. During negotiations GOK&#13;
and KNEHC agreed that the project accounts of all IDA -financed components will be subject to&#13;
an independent annual audit by an audit firm acceptable to IDA and in accordance with&#13;
international auditing guidelines; and the result of such audit will be submitted to IDA no later&#13;
than six months after the close of the fiscal year.&#13;
4.33  Annex 4.10 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit. The credit is&#13;
assumed to be fully disbursed by December 31, 2000. The project is expected to be completed&#13;
by June 30, 2000, and the closing date for the credit would be December 31, 2000.&#13;

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
5.1    An analysis of the financial standing of KNEHC is particularly complex given: (i) the&#13;
high inflation rates until the national currency (the "som") was introduced in 1993; (ii) the&#13;
material differences between Kyrgyz and international accounting standards (IAS); (iii) the&#13;
absence of independent audit (para. 3.15); and (iv) the involvement of KNEHC in two activities&#13;
for which fully separated accounts are not maintained. Furthermnore, the company does not have&#13;
appropriate costing and/or budgeting systems. Any financial review of KNEHC has to take into&#13;
account the above caveats.&#13;
B.    FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER 1993-94&#13;
5.2    KNEHC is involved in two separate activities, the supply of electricity and the supply&#13;
of heat (in the form of hot water and steam). The accounts of the two activities are not fully&#13;
separated'. Since the district heating activity is confined to four urban locations, and is handled&#13;
by distinct "enterprises", the separation of the accounts should not represent an excessively&#13;
challenging task. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, in addition to annual&#13;
consolidated accounts, from FYI 996 onwards, KNEHC will prepare separate annual financial&#13;
statements for its power and heat activities.&#13;
5.3    KNEHC produces operating statements for the two activities. The results for the past two&#13;
years, converted for convenience into US$, can be summarized as follows:&#13;

5.4    Given that the above statements were converted to US$ in a highly inflationary&#13;
environment, relative values rather than absolute ones are important. For the electricity activity:&#13;
(i) overall sales volumes to the domestic market have been stagnant while exports more than&#13;
doubled between 1993 and 1994; and (ii) the provisions for depreciation are insignificant - they&#13;
should normally account for 20-40% of operating expenses. The electricity activity is apparently&#13;
profitable.&#13;
5.5    For the district heating activity: (i) the overall volume of sales has declined (mostly&#13;
because KNEHC ceased to supply hot water in the warm season to save fuel costs); (ii) fuels&#13;
alone account for about 80% of operating expenses; and (iii) the provisions for depreciation are&#13;
insignificant. KNEHC operates the district heating operations at a loss. While in 1993, operating&#13;
revenues barely covered 50% of operating expenses, the ratio fell to 40% in 1994.&#13;
5.6    Thus, the district heating activity is being subsidized by the electricity activity. This cross&#13;
subsidy is detrimental to the development of the sector inter alia because: (i) consumers are not&#13;
getting the right price signals which leads to waste; (ii) the electricity activity is denied funds&#13;
that would otherwise be available for its development. As Bishkek accounts for 80% of the heat&#13;
market in the Kyrgyz Republic but for only 12% of the power market (para. 2.6 and Annex&#13;
2.1), the majority of the population, which does not have access to district heating (and therefore&#13;
has to pay high charges for alternative fuels such as coal, fuel oil, natural gas), is being asked&#13;
in addition to support the district heating operation in the capital, through higher electricity rates.&#13;
5.7    The consolidated income statements can be summarized as follows:&#13;

5.8   In addition to the comments made above, one should note that: (i) KNEHC pays no&#13;
interest - it has almost no long term debt; and (ii) KNEHC is paying rapidly increasing taxes,&#13;
equivalent to almost 30% of operating income - the amount would be considerably less if&#13;
KNEHC were allowed to revalue its assets and have realistic depreciation charges.&#13;

(soms/US$)                               8.03         10.65&#13;
5.10 Keeping in mind that the above balance sheets were converted at year-end exchange rates&#13;
in an highly inflationary environment: (i) fixed assets are considerably undervalued - a partial&#13;
revaluation was made in 1993, but at US$37 million, they are insignificant when taking into&#13;
account that KNEHC is a utility with in excess of 3,000 MW installed generating capacity; (ii)&#13;
work in progress is probably understated by a considerable margin - major construction works&#13;
at Kambar Ata 2 have been abandoned in midstream; and (iii) KNEHC has virtually no long&#13;
term debt - the minor debt it carries is to local banks towards the financing of essentially&#13;
recurring expenditures.&#13;
5.11   Given the importance of re-valuing assets, inter alia for the determination of tariffs and&#13;
long term privatization of KNEHC, the consultants carrying out the tariff study (para. 2.25) will&#13;
also assist in the re-valuation of assets. To that effect, at negotiations, assurances were obtained&#13;
that: (i) KNEHC will conduct a re-valuation of assets, on the basis of a methodology satisfactory&#13;
to IDA, and apply it to its December 31, 1995 balance sheet; and (ii) effective FY1997, re-valued&#13;
assets and corresponding depreciation charges will be recognized by GOK for income tax&#13;
purposes.&#13;
&#13;

5.12 As of December 31, 1994, gross accounts receivable at 870 million soms are to be&#13;
compared to annual sales of 1.4 billion soms, or 222 days of sale equivalent. This applies to&#13;
domestic electricity and heat sales, as well as to electricity exports (200 days). Not surprisingly,&#13;
KNEHC owes vast amounts to its suppliers, particularly of oil products and natural gas. It is&#13;
also confronting difficulties in paying its staff. The arrears, for the domestic market, can be&#13;
broken up as follows:&#13;
Domestic Accounts Receivable as of December 31, 1994&#13;

a/ Because of weaknesses in the billing and collection system (para. 3.8), arrears of households are most likely understated.&#13;
5.13 KNEHC is aware of the problem, and has initiated a campaign to reduce arrears, inter&#13;
alia, by improving the billing and collection system which has proven effective. Furthermore,&#13;
in August 1995, the Government settled the arrears of the public sector (para. 3. 10). In order&#13;
to ensure that the performance of KNEHC improves in this respect, assurances were obtained&#13;
at negotiations that KNEHC will take all actions required to ensure that domestic accounts&#13;
receivable for power and heat, taken separately, shall not exceed the equivalent of 90 days by&#13;
December 31, 1996, and 60 days by December 31, 1997 and thereafter. These conditions are&#13;
identical to those recently agreed between EBRD, the Government and KNEHC.&#13;
C.    FINANCIAL PROGNOSIS&#13;
5.14 When developing financial goals for KNEHC, several important factors have to be&#13;
considered:&#13;
(i)    the profitability of KNEHC is presently mainly dependent on its ability to export&#13;
electricity to Kazakstan. In 1994, such export revenues amounted to 720 million soms,&#13;
which represented nearly 50% of total revenues for that year - without such revenues,&#13;
instead of a profit of 379 million som, KNEHC would have made a loss of 351 million&#13;
som. In the first half of 1995, no exports took place, as the two countries could not agree&#13;
on a price. Until a long term export contract is finalized, export revenues will remain&#13;
unreliable.&#13;
(ii)   further, district heating should not be subsidized by electricity tariffs given the&#13;
distribution of district heating users (para. 5.6);&#13;
(iii)  there is little rationale for penalizing industry and agriculture, by requiring these&#13;
activities to subsidize households (para. 2.21); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial Aspects                                                                           37&#13;
(iv)   given the high inflation rate in Kyrgyz Republic and the low income levels, tariff&#13;
adjustments can only be realistically done gradually.&#13;
5.15   Consistently with the above strategy, electricity and heat tariffs were revised in April&#13;
1996, and a recent decree provides for a further adjustment to be made effective on July 1, 1996&#13;
(para 2.25). With the latter revision which is significant,2 revenues will suffice to cover all cash&#13;
costs on an annualized basis. Further, at negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom GOKthat.-&#13;
power and heat tariffs will be revised: (i) December 31, 1996, to allow KNEHC to recover its&#13;
total operating expenses and depreciation (on a re-valued basis); and (ii) December 31, 1997,&#13;
to allow KNEHC to recover its total operating expenses, debt service charges, working capital&#13;
allowances and allow the utility to finance from internal sources not less than 30% of its&#13;
investment program.&#13;
5.16  Important additional assumptions underlying the financial projections are that effective&#13;
1996, KNEHC will be able to secure long term financing for some 70% of its investment&#13;
program, and that it will be able to export 1,500 GWh annually to Kazakstan at an average tariff&#13;
of USc4/kWh. Under these assumptions, the financial projections indicate that the financial&#13;
performance of KNEHC will gradually improve and be satisfactory in the coming years:&#13;

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A.  PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
6.1  The physical components of the proposed project--rehabilitation and upgrading of the&#13;
Bishkek CHP plant, Bishkek district heating system, and transmission and distribution facilities&#13;
in zhe north--will provide the following benefits: (a) reduced power, heat and water losses; (b)&#13;
increased effective capacity to supply and deliver power and heat; (c) reduced power outages and&#13;
improved voltage stability; (d) improved dispatching of heat supply; (e) reduced operating and&#13;
maintenance costs; (f) reduced environmental impact; and (g) extended life of the rehabilitated&#13;
assets.&#13;
6.2  The primary benefits of the technical support and training component--including project&#13;
preparation and implementation support, and assistance in policy development and institutional&#13;
strengthening--will comprise: (a) enhanced project management capabilities within KNEHC; (b)&#13;
improved financial viability of KNEHC (through improved consumer billing/collections,&#13;
rationalized tariff setting, establishment of clear financial targets, etc.); (c) strengthened financial&#13;
and organizational management of KNEHC; (d) progress toward KNEHC's commercialization;&#13;
and (e) enhanced prospects for private sector involvement in the power and heat sector (through&#13;
establishing a suitable legal/regulatory framework and developing a strategy for sector&#13;
restructuring/privatization).&#13;
6.3  For the petroleum exploration promotion component, the benefit will be the attraction of&#13;
investments from the international oil industry with state-of-the-art technology and offering a real&#13;
possibility of finding oil and gas reserves in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
B.   ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
6.4 The proposed project is the least-cost alternative for the supply of heat in the city of&#13;
Bishkek and for maintaining an acceptable level of reliability and availability of power supply&#13;
to the economy. The project preparation consultants (financed by USAID and EU-TACIS)&#13;
carried out a detailed assessment of the condition and need for rehabilitation and upgrading of&#13;
the Bishkek CHP plant and district heating system, and of the country's transmission and&#13;
distribution facilities. Alternatives to district heating, including decentralized natural gas and&#13;
electrical resistance heating, were also evaluated, and a framework transmission and distribution&#13;
system master plan prepared. In the case of the Bishkek CHP plant and DH system, an&#13;
economic model was developed during the feasibility study to simulate system operation with&#13;
and without the project and estimate the associated costs of supplying power, heat and process&#13;
steam to the Bishkek area. In the case of the transmission and distribution facilities, load flow&#13;
models were developed for the Bishkek area and a representative rural area (Kalinin under the&#13;
Chu Electric Company) to assist in identifying system needs, evaluating alternative reinforcement&#13;
schemes, prioritizing investment alternatives and quantifying project benefits; to the extent&#13;
possible, these findings were extrapolated to assess the overall situation of the country's&#13;
transmission and distribution system. In addition, a supplemental study financed by the Swiss&#13;
government carried out a detailed evaluation of the 220-kV interconnection between Kemin and&#13;
Naryn. A brief description of the models and key assumptions is given in Annex 6.1 (Bishkek&#13;
CHP plant and DH system) and Anne-x 6.2 (transmission and distribution facilities), with full&#13;
details in the project feasibility study and supplemental report (Kemin-Naryn interconnection)&#13;
in the project file.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                                                                         Project Justification&#13;
6.5   The economic evaluation carried out during project appraisal is limited to the three main&#13;
physical components and associated technical assistance and is based on the findings of the&#13;
project preparation consultants.  Investment costs are based on project costs inclusive of&#13;
implementation assistance and physical contingencies and exclusive of price contingencies and&#13;
customs duties and taxes.  All other costs are based on financial costs excluding price&#13;
contingencies and duties/taxes; energy costs are similarly based on current import (e.g., coal,&#13;
natural gas and fuel oil) or export (electricity) prices including transport and excluding&#13;
duties/taxes. In the case of the Bishkek CHP plant and DH system, the main benefits are cost&#13;
savings in terms of reduced energy and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs to meet the&#13;
same level of demand. In the case of the transmission and distribution facilities, the main&#13;
benefits are reduced losses and outages. Power and heat demand forecasts are consistent with&#13;
those used in the financial analysis; these are somewhat below estimates in the Bank's Energy&#13;
Sector Review in line with the Bank's current macro projections for the Kyrgyz Republic and&#13;
taking into consideration the project's expected impact on system operation and losses. The&#13;
analysis is done in US dollars using constant 1995 prices and exchange rate. The economic&#13;
internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall project is conservatively estimated as 30%, which&#13;
is acceptable (12% is assumed as the opportunity cost of capital for the country); the overall net&#13;
present value (NPV) is US$ 89 million. The project economic analysis by project component&#13;
is summarized below; supporting details are in Annexes 6.1 and 6.2.&#13;
6.6 Bishkek CHP Plant and District Heating System. The Bishkek CHP plant, as the only&#13;
major power generating station in the northern part of the Kyrgyz Republic, plays a key role in&#13;
the power supply of the region and the country as a whole. It is also the main supplier of the&#13;
Bishkek district heating network and supplies heat and power at significantly lower cost/higher&#13;
efficiency than heat-only boilers and power-only coal-fired thermal stations.' The project&#13;
includes only the highest priority rehabilitation components which are essential for&#13;
restoring/maintaining plant operations.&#13;
6.7   The Bishkek district heating system provides heat and hot water to over half of the city's&#13;
population and process steam to various industries. A detailed assessment of alternative means&#13;
of meeting the city's heating needs using electrical heating and natural gas was carried out&#13;
during the feasibility study. In the case of electrical resistance heating, investment costs in&#13;
transmission and distribution capacity only (excluding generating capacity) would be about US$&#13;
270 million, plus another US$145 million for adjustments to heating systems within the&#13;
apartment buildings; annual production costs (electricity and O&amp;M) would be on the order of&#13;
US$80 million. In the case of decentralized natural gas heating, the required investment costs&#13;
would be about US$160 million (US$50 million in the gas network to bring sufficient gas at&#13;
adequate pressure to the areas now served by district heating and US$ 110 million in adjustments&#13;
to heating systems within the buildings) and annual production costs US$ 30 million.&#13;
Rehabilitation of the Bishkek CHP plant and the existing district heating system (base cost US$&#13;
43 million and annual production costs US$32 million) is clearly the least cost and most feasible&#13;
alternative, now and in the foreseeable future.&#13;
I/   Comparative fuel efficiency figures for coal, for example, are 115% and 45% respectively for heat and&#13;
power in a CHP plant, and 80% and 35% in separate heat and power units.&#13;

Figures pertain to heat production/consumption only.&#13;
6.9   The economic analysis of the Bishkek CHP plant and DH system  rehabilitation has been&#13;
done for the two components separately and combined. The analysis has been carried out for&#13;
15 years following completion of the rehabilitation and modernization work; the main benefits&#13;
have been quantified in terms of energy and O&amp;M cost savings in the with the project case in&#13;
meeting the same level of demand as without the project. For electricity, in the without the&#13;
project case, there is some shortfall in meeting demand in the outer years of the analysis due to&#13;
retirements; this incremental demand is valued at an estimated consumer willingness to pay&#13;
(WTP) of 4.7 USC/kWh. Similarly, for district heating, where the system modernization will&#13;
allow integration of two previously separate district heating systems (Bishkek DH system and&#13;
local DH system), retirements in the local system will also lead to shortfalls in meeting demand&#13;
for heat in the without project case in the outer years of the analysis; this incremental demand&#13;
is valued at a WTP of US$ 15.7/Gcal. The WTP estimates for electricity and heat are low&#13;
because of the low current tariffs (particularly for households); production costs of serving the&#13;
incremental demand are included in terms of reducing the energy and O&amp;M cost savings&#13;
attributed to the project, except for the incremental costs of transmitting and distributing the&#13;
additional electricity which are costed separately. Environmental benefits due to reduced fuel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                                                         Project Justification&#13;
use, especially coal, are not quantified in the analysis.  Benefits pertaining to improved&#13;
reliability and availability of the Bishkek CHP plant and to the potential for expansion of the&#13;
Bishkek DH system to include newly developing parts of the city, without increasing the heat&#13;
production capacity, are also not quantified in the economic evaluation.&#13;
6.10 The EIRR for the Bishkek CHP plant rehabilitation is about 29%, for the DH system&#13;
rehabilitation and modernization 20%, and for the two combined 23%; the NPVs are&#13;
respectively, US$ 22 million, US$ 10 million and US$ 29 million. Potential risks affecting these&#13;
project components are: (a) extension of the construction period, hence delayed receipt of project&#13;
benefits, due to shortage of counterpart funds or other implementation problems; (b) lower than&#13;
estimated production cost savings benefits or benefits over a shorter period than expected, due&#13;
to technical or other reasons; and (c) higher than estimated investment costs required to carry&#13;
out the rehabilitation works. Sensitivity and breakeven analyses indicate the EIRRs for these&#13;
project components are robust. For example, a two-year delay in construction and start-up of&#13;
benefits (50% increase in construction time) results in a 19% EIRR for the combined Bishkek&#13;
CHP plant and DH system rehabilitation; limiting the benefit period to five years after project&#13;
completion, instead of the expected 15 years, results in a 13% EIRR. Breakeven analysis shows&#13;
that benefits could be reduced by 44% or investment costs increased by 81 %, and the EIRR for&#13;
the overall component would still be 12%. Supporting tables are in Annex 6.1.&#13;

6.11  Transmission and Distribution (T&amp;D) Facilities. During the feasibility study, load flow&#13;
studies and detailed assessment of alternative reinforcement programs were carried out to&#13;
determine the least cost, highest priority T&amp;D components for inclusion in the project. In line&#13;
with the expectation that the Government will reverse its policy of encouraging electrical&#13;
heating, the power demand forecasts used in these analyses assumed there would be no further&#13;
increase in electrical heating. The northern Kyrgyz Republic and particularly the Bishkek area&#13;
are heavily dependent on power supplies from  other parts of the country.  Taking into&#13;
consideration the age and condition of the T&amp;D network and high demands being placed on it,&#13;
the risk of a serious blackout in Bishkek and nearby areas is high. The T&amp;D component of the&#13;
project concentrates on these areas, with a view to improving the reliability and quality of supply&#13;
and reducing such risk; the specific investments were selected from a prioritized list of&#13;
investments prepared during the feasibility study. The T&amp;D component of the project would&#13;
construct 220/1 10-kV substations at Ala Archa and Naryn, the first to reinforce the transmission&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Justification                                                              43&#13;
system supplying Bishkek and the second to complement completion of the 220-kV transmission&#13;
line interconnecting Kemin and Naryn, rehabilitate and reinforce selected existing substations&#13;
(various voltage levels), retrofit 1 10-kV switchgear, and provide meters and other essential tools.&#13;
The table below summarizes in physical terms the main benefits of the T&amp;D facilities&#13;
rehabilitation and reinforcement for 2000, the first full year of operation after completion of&#13;
T&amp;D works under the project.&#13;

6.12 The economic analysis of the T&amp;D facilities component has been done for the Ala Archa&#13;
substation (nearly 40% of the component investment cost), the Naryn substation (including&#13;
completion of the Kemin-Naryn transmission line and associated works being financed separately&#13;
by EBRD), the remaining T&amp;D rehabilitation and reinforcement works, and the combined&#13;
project component. The analysis has been carried out for 25 years following completion of the&#13;
rehabilitation and reinforcement work. Incremental O&amp;M costs have been included at 1 % of&#13;
capital costs. The energy loss reduction benefits have been valued at the long-run cost of&#13;
generation (3.7 USc/kWh), deferred generating capacity additions resulting from reduced system&#13;
losses at the capital cost of new generating capacity (US$ 750/kW), and reduced frequency of&#13;
outages at a conservatively estimated cost of 20 USC/kWh. Incremental sales resulting from&#13;
increased transmission capacity, which would be significant, have not been included in the&#13;
analysis because of the low WTP and uncertainty in the demand forecasts; the project&#13;
components are fully justified without these benefits. Environmental benefits due to reduced fuel&#13;
use have also not been included in the analysis.&#13;
6.13 The EIRR for the Ala Archa substation construction is about 40%, for the Naryn&#13;
substation construction (including Kemin-Naryn transmission line completion) 52%, for the&#13;
remaining T&amp;D rehabilitation and reinforcement works 19%, and for the overall T&amp;D&#13;
component 38%; the NPVs are respectively, US$ 25 million, US$ 30 million, US$ 5 million&#13;
and US$ 60 million. Potential risks affecting these project components are: (a) extension of the&#13;
construction period, hence delayed receipt of project benefits; (b) lower than estimated loss and&#13;
outage reduction benefits or benefits over a shorter period than expected; and (c) higher than&#13;
estimated investment costs required to carry out the rehabilitation and reinforcement works.&#13;
Sensitivity and breakeven analyses indicate the EIRRs for these project components are robust.&#13;
For example, the overall T&amp;D component has a 29% EIRR if the construction period is&#13;
increased by two years, or 50%, and the benefits delayed accordingly; it has a 37% EIRR if the&#13;
benefit period is shortened to eight years after project completion, or one-third of the expected&#13;
25-year period. Breakeven analysis shows that benefits could be reduced by 69% or investment&#13;
costs increased by 240%, and the EIRR for the overall component would still be 12%.&#13;

C.   PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.14 The project is not expected to have detrimental effects on the environment and presents&#13;
no unusual physical risks since it involves rehabilitation and upgrading work on standard&#13;
generation, district heating, and transmission and distribution facilities. The main risks that may&#13;
cause problems in project implementation include: (a) front-end delays; (b) inadequate project&#13;
management capabilities of KNEHC; and (c) KNEHC's weak financial condition which may lead&#13;
to unavailability of counterpart funds. Measures have been incorporated in the project design&#13;
to reduce these risks. Early establishment of the Project Implementation Unit and staffing it&#13;
with qualified local personnel and selected international experts to assist in engineering design,&#13;
procurement and construction supervision will facilitate timely project start-up. The project&#13;
includes technical support and training activities that will help KNEHC staff to strengthen their&#13;
project management and operation skills. Technical support is also being provided, under the&#13;
project as well as by other donors, to enable KNEHC to improve its financial management and&#13;
commercialize its operations. For example, KNEHC's billing and collection practices will be&#13;
modernized, tariff setting mechanism rationalized to enable full cost recovery and financing of&#13;
its development program, and accounting systems upgraded to international standards;&#13;
establishment of and adherence to sound financial targets will also help to ensure the availability&#13;
of counterpart funds. Technical support provided during project preparation and implementation&#13;
will also help to mitigate the risks of cost overruns during the project and reduced benefits once&#13;
the works are completed. Moreover, as demonstrated by the sensitivity analyses carried out&#13;
during project appraisal (paras. 6.10, 6.13), the project investments are viable over a reasonable&#13;
range of such risks.&#13;
6.15 There is also a risk associated with the political sensitivity of energy price increases and&#13;
energy sector restructuring measures.  However, the Government is strongly committed to&#13;
economic reform as demonstrated by its past actions, and the changes will be introduced in a&#13;
phased manner to ameliorate the impact.  For example, the draft energy and electricity&#13;
legislation, an important early step in the power and heat sector's transition process, was&#13;
submitted to Parliament in February 1996 and is expected to be approved by end-September&#13;
1996; the State Energy Agency was created and its chairman appointed by Presidential acts&#13;
issued in March 1996; and power and heat tariffs were increased in April 1996, with further&#13;
adjustments planned in July 1996, together with the introduction of a social safety net for the&#13;
poor. At the same time, it should be noted that these broader sectoral restructuring efforts are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Justification                                                                45&#13;
not critical to the success of the physical project (with the exception of aspects pertaining&#13;
directly to KNEHC's financial and managerial performance), rather they are important in terms&#13;
of addressing longer term sectoral objectives.&#13;
6.16 For the petroleum exploration promotion component, there is a risk that international oil&#13;
companies will show no interest either because the potential for oil discoveries and export is&#13;
perceived as being less promising than elsewhere or because the promotion effort has not been&#13;
carried out satisfactorily. This would be mitigated by using state-of-the-art technology in&#13;
compiling the geological data base and highly qualified consultants in carrying out the&#13;
promotion. The Govermment's adoption of a satisfactory legal and fiscal framework for&#13;
petroleum, which would facilitate the country's contracting with international oil companies,&#13;
would   be   a  prerequisite  for  any   disbursements  for  this  component.&#13;

SOCIAL SAFETY NET: RESULTS FROM A SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
I.     Introduction&#13;
1.     A social assessment was carried out as part of the project preparation of the Power and&#13;
District Heating Rehabilitation Project. The objectives of this assessment were to: (i) analyze&#13;
patterns of fuel use for distinct groups of rural and urban households; (ii) evaluate implications&#13;
of higher energy costs for residential consumers; (iii) outline elements of an energy strategy for&#13;
different segments of households and (iv) design a social safety net for protecting the lowest-&#13;
income households from increased energy costs'.&#13;
2.      This assessment, undertaken  in collaboration  with  local experts, consisted  of the&#13;
following activities: (i) in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with low-income&#13;
consumers, NGO representatives, and government officials; (ii) data analysis of the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic Household Energy Survey 2 and (iii) a user survey of 150 households on district heat&#13;
in Bishkek undertaken in June 1995 to better appraise the peoples' capacity and willingness to&#13;
pay for heating and hot water3.&#13;
3.      The combined effect of the recent increases of coal and LPG  prices and the proposed&#13;
higher tariffs for heat, hot water, electricity, and gas, will have a major impact on household&#13;
energy users in the Kyrgyz Republic, particularly among the low-income segment of the&#13;
population. To mitigate the adverse social effects of these price increases on vulnerable groups,&#13;
the Government should put in place a suitable social safety net. Based on the results of this&#13;
social assessment, the key element of such a safety net would require the provision of subsidies&#13;
to the lowest-income consumers, particularly urban households using (i) district heating and (ii)&#13;
natural gas for heating and (iii) urban and rural households using coal, firewood and dung for&#13;
heating.&#13;
II.    Findings of the Social Assessment / Patterns of Household Energy Use&#13;
3.      This social assessment revealed that the fuel use patterns in the Kyrgyz Republic are&#13;
determined by three factors: in urban areas, (i) access to district heat and (ii) access to the&#13;
natural gas network and (iii) in rural areas, the availability of an outside stove for cooking.&#13;
I The detailed report of this social assessment is available in the project files.&#13;
2 This survey, undertaken in October 1994 by the Energy Advisory Group and financed by the European Union, generated&#13;
a sample comprising of 686 urban and rural households.&#13;
3This was a complementary survey which provided data on income and household expenditure on food and energy. The&#13;
income data showed that the average income of the population on district heat is 920 soms per month; the average income of&#13;
a one-person household is 397 soms, a 2-person household 713 soms, a 3-person household 822, a 4-person household 1212 soms&#13;
and 5 and more person household 1413 soms per month. It is remarkable to see that 22 % of the households on district heat in&#13;
Bishkek earn 1200 soms per month.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
69                                                                                     Annex 2.6&#13;
These factors allow the classification of households into segments and sub-segments of energy&#13;
users beyond the broad distinction of rural and urban households, providing a more precise&#13;
picture of distinct fuel use patterns among different groups of households (Chart 1). First, urban&#13;
households can be divided into households with access to the district heating network, the core-&#13;
urban households, and households without access to this network, the semi-urban households.&#13;
Second, these two segments of households can be further subdivided into sub-segments with&#13;
access to the network of natural gas supply and sub-segments without access to this network.&#13;
The resulting four sub-segments of urban households are characterized by distinct patterns of&#13;
fuel use (Charts 2 and 3). Furthermore, the segment of rural households can be divided into&#13;
4&#13;
households owning a stove for cooking in their yards and households not owning such a stove4.&#13;
These two sub-segments of rural households also show distinct patterns of fuel use (Chart 4).&#13;
The identified patterns of fuel use of the different household segments were a key frame of&#13;
reference for data analysis. These are discussed below in greater detail.&#13;
4.     Core-Urban Households&#13;
This group of urban households has access to the district heating network.  They&#13;
comprise 25 % of all households in the Kyrgyz Republic and the vast majority reside in&#13;
apartment buildings located in the central parts of the cities. Eight out of ten core-urban&#13;
households live in the city of Bishkek, which has the largest district heating network. Others&#13;
live in cities also connected to the district heating network namely, Karakol, Karakul, Kyzil Kiya&#13;
and Osh.&#13;
5.     While all core-urban households use district heating as the principle means of space&#13;
heating, their access to the network of the natural gas supply determines the fuel use patterns&#13;
for cooking and water heating5 (Table 1). Those with access to the natural gas network use&#13;
natural gas all-year round and almost exclusively, for cooking their main meals, breakfast and&#13;
snacks as well as heating water, mostly for hot beverages such as tea and coffee. Natural gas&#13;
is also used to supplement district heating. Focus group discussions with district heat customers&#13;
revealed that households often use their gas-fired cooking stove to supplement district heating.&#13;
By contrast, those without access to the natural gas network use electricity mainly for cooking&#13;
and water heating, also for tea and coffee mainly. To some extent, LPG and firewood are also&#13;
used.&#13;
6.     Semi-urban households&#13;
This group of urban households has no access to district heating. The great majority live&#13;
in individual, private houses located mostly in the outskirts of the cities. The fuel use patterns&#13;
of semi-urban households are also largely determined by access to the natural gas network.&#13;
Those with access to the natural gas network use natural gas for space heating, cooking, and&#13;
water heating --- almost exclusively in both winter and summer. Other fuels like electricity,&#13;
coal, firewood, dung are less frequently used. On the other hand, those without access to the&#13;
4 This is based on qualitative information provided by local experts.&#13;
5 Hot water is also provided as part of district heating. The survey results showed, however, that 93% of core-urban&#13;
households with gas connection use natural gas for water heating, mainly for making hot beverages such as coffee and tea.&#13;
Among households without natural gas, 85% use electricity for the same purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.6                                                                             70&#13;
natural gas network have a much more diversified fuel use pattern, characterized by distinct&#13;
seasonal variations. In winter, these households use coal and electricity, primarily for space&#13;
heating and cooking main meals, with firewood used oftentimes as an important complementary&#13;
fuel, in combination with coal. Moreover, households use electricity or LPG for cooking&#13;
breakfast, snacks, and heating water for coffee and tea. In summer, electricity is primarily used&#13;
to cook the main meals as well as breakfast, snacks and heat water.&#13;
7.    Rural Households&#13;
Compared to core-urban and semi-urban households, rural households have the most&#13;
complex pattern of fuel use. They rely on a wider range of fuels because they do not have&#13;
access to district heating nor the natural gas network. Coal, firewood, dung, electricity and&#13;
LPG are the fuels used mostly by rural households (Table 1). Qualitative information6 from the&#13;
field further revealed that households owning a stove for cooking in their yards, comprising&#13;
about 60 % of rural households, follow a different seasonal pattern of fuel use compared to those&#13;
not owning such a stove. In summer, the former cook their main meals on those stoves burning&#13;
firewood, agricultural waste and dung whereas the latter use mainly electricity and LPG (Chart&#13;
4).&#13;
8.    According to local experts, there has been a massive shift to dung, electricity and&#13;
firewood usage for heating and cooking, as a result of the recent increases in coal and LPG&#13;
prices. Similarly, results from the household energy survey showed that more than one-third&#13;
of rural households now use dung as their main heating fuel (Table 2). In addition, nearly three-&#13;
quarters of households reported using more of dung now for space heating and cooking and&#13;
about two-thirds use more of electricity now for the same purposes (Table 3). Despite the&#13;
reported increase in the use of electricity, local experts believe that electricity consumption in&#13;
rural areas is under-reported because of the high incidence of illegal connections.&#13;
III.   Conclusions and Recommendations: Implications for the Design of Social Safety Net&#13;
9.    This section describes the implications and potential impacts of the increased energy&#13;
tariffs on various groups of the population. It also outlines specific recommendations for a&#13;
social safety net to protect the poorest households that will be hurt the most by the increased&#13;
tariffs. As a short-to-medium term measure, energy subsidies, in the form of coupons, will be&#13;
provided to eligible low-income households using district heating, natural gas and coal. Over&#13;
the long-term, a cost-effective program on household energy-efficiency and conservation is&#13;
proposed to be established as a follow-up measure to ensure sustainability of reforms in the&#13;
district heating sector. A summary matrix is provided in Chart 5.&#13;
10.   District Heating and Hot Water&#13;
Approximately half of the urban population in the Kyrgyz Republic is provided with heat&#13;
and hot water from the district heating network, the main source of heating for this population.&#13;
Other fuels like coal, gas, heating oil, LPG, kerosene or dung are not used for heating.&#13;
6 The 1994 Kyrgyz Republic Household Energy Survey used in this Social Assessment did not have data on stove ownership&#13;
in yards among rural households.&#13;

11.   The most vulnerable group in the urban areas are the households connected to the district&#13;
heating network. Urban households currently spend an average of 20 soms per month on district&#13;
heating. With the proposed tariff increases, core-urban households will experience a staggering&#13;
increase in their district heating bill, roughly 9 times its current level (Figure 1, Table 6).&#13;

12.   In addition, households will also have to assume increased payments for electricity under&#13;
a new tariff structure. While the impact of higher electricity tariffs will be low for households&#13;
with gas and moderate for those without gas, the combined increases in fuel prices will have a&#13;
major impact on households particularly those in the lowest-income group.&#13;
13.   The Bishkek survey of district heat customers provided information on household capacity&#13;
to pay for utilities. On average, 70% of total household expenditure is spent on food and about&#13;
10% on energy. Not surprisingly, however, households in the lowest expenditure category have&#13;
a higher food expenditure share of 78% and about 22% is spent on energy, with nothing left for&#13;
other monthly subsistence needs (Figure 2). This implies that households would have to resort&#13;
to borrowing money to pay for other essential requirements such as transport, housing, education&#13;
and health care. With the on-going institutionalization of economic reforms in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic, some of which involve cost recovery schemes, households are having to assume&#13;
increased financial responsibility for the use of basic social services. Clearly, low-income&#13;
households will suffer disproportionately given this scenario.&#13;
14.   Safety Net Provision for Low-income Households with District Heating&#13;
In particular, higher tariffs for heat and hot water on low-income consumers would be&#13;
cushioned through a subsidy scheme which aims to (i) protect poor and vulnerable groups of the&#13;
population while ensuring at the same time that they pay what they can afford, and (ii) cause&#13;
higher income groups to pay the real cost of supply. The subsidy design has been guided by the&#13;
principle to (i) keep KNEHC from accomplishing social functions constraining business&#13;
performance, and (ii) assign genuine social responsibilities to agencies that are in charge and&#13;
qualified to assume them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73                                                                           Annex 2.6&#13;
15.   The level of subsidy is based on the assumption that the maximum expenditure threshold&#13;
for heating and hot water should be no more than 30% of total monthly household income. The&#13;
portion of the heating and hot water bill over 30% will be subsidized. While such an estimate&#13;
is high, even for those with adequate income, it represents a mid-point benchmark based on&#13;
recent empirical data: (1) the reported fuel expenditure share of 22% for low-income households&#13;
in the Bishkek survey and (2) the expenditure share of about 40% for non-food items for poor&#13;
urban households estimated in the recent Kyrgyz Republic Poverty Assessment7. Based on the&#13;
latter non-food expenditure share figure of 40%, the 30% benchmark would mean that the food&#13;
budget of the poorest household would not be jeopardized although, they will have to make&#13;
significant adjustments with respect to other non-food requirements. For the lowest-income&#13;
consumers, the energy price shocks will be extremely difficult to absorb particularly in an&#13;
environment where low-cost fuel substitutes are not available.&#13;
16.   Based on a population of about 200,000 households with district heating and on income&#13;
data collected in this Social Assessment, an estimated 70,000 households would be eligible for&#13;
the subsidy. The estimated annual cost of the subsidy would amount to approximately 56 million&#13;
soms.&#13;
17.   Long-term Project Strategy&#13;
Since the subsidy is envisioned to be phased out over the short- to medium-term, a more&#13;
sustainable development program for the district heating sector will have to be considered. This&#13;
will involve the implementation of a follow-up project to assist households in reducing their costs&#13;
for heating and hot water. This will consist of two major components:&#13;
(i)    modest investments in energy and water efficiency to rationalize the consumption&#13;
of hot water by installing hot water meters in the apartments, introducing&#13;
consumption-based billing, and promoting the conservation of hot water, and&#13;
(ii)   modest investments in energy efficiency to reduce heat losses by improving&#13;
insulation both at the building (attic, basement) and apartment levels (caulking,&#13;
weatherstripping) and reduce excessive ventilation in the buildings and&#13;
apartments.&#13;
18.   The Bishkek survey showed that the above strategy to improve energy and water&#13;
efficiency could be successful: 82% of the district heat and hot water customers would welcome&#13;
consumption-based billing for hot water; 77% would be able and willing to conserve hot water;&#13;
40% of the latter would be able to save up to 25% of their actual consumption, whereas 35%&#13;
of them would be able to save between 25% and 50% of their present consumption; 45% of the&#13;
respondents would be willing to install such a meter and pay in monthly installments.&#13;
Willingness to pay bids for additional heating and hot water costs and installation of hot water&#13;
meters for consumption-based billing are shown in Figure 3 below.&#13;

19.   Natural Gas&#13;
At present, the sub-segment of semi-urban households with access to the natural gas&#13;
network suffers most from recent fuel price and related tariff increases, particularly for natural&#13;
gas. They rely on natural gas as their principal fuel for space heating, cooking and water&#13;
heating, all-year round. They live mostly in private houses, are not connected to the district&#13;
heating network and have very limited means to cope with the impact of high natural gas prices&#13;
because cheaper alternative fuels like dung are not available. This segment of the population&#13;
pays the highest energy bill -- an average of 250 soms/month, of which 95% accounts for gas&#13;
consumption (Table 5).&#13;
20.   Currently, gas consumption is not metered. Consumers pay a flat rate based on usage,&#13;
the area of the home, and the number of persons in the household. This system does not&#13;
provide an incentive for energy-saving. Additional reduction of the household energy bill could&#13;
be achieved through the installation of gas meters, introduction of consumption-based billing and&#13;
the promotion of gas conservation.&#13;
21.   Safety Net Provision for Low-income Natural Gas Consumers&#13;
The beneficiaries of the subsidy would be the low-income semi-urban population&#13;
connected to the natural gas network. Of the 70,000 households using natural gas for heating&#13;
and cooking, about 20,000 households are estimated to benefit from the subsidy. These will be&#13;
given in the form of coupons to be used against payment of natural gas bills. The total cost of&#13;
the subsidy would amount to about 16 million soms per year.&#13;
22.   Coal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75                                                                             Annex 2.6&#13;
Specific groups of the population have been seriously affected by the recent increase in&#13;
coal prices. The most vulnerable are found in urban areas, specifically semi-urban households&#13;
without natural gas as well as rural households, who rely on coal as their main heating and&#13;
cooking fuel. The survey data showed that nine out of ten semi-urban households without&#13;
natural gas use coal as their main heating fuel. In rural areas, relatively fewer households are&#13;
dependent on coal (60%) since more than one-third use dung as their main heating fuel.&#13;
23.   Safety Net Provision for Low-income Coal Users&#13;
The subsidy for urban and rural households would be targeted primarily to households&#13;
below the poverty line, comprising 175,000 households in rural areas and 21,000 households in&#13;
urban areas (i.e. semi-urban households without natural gas). The subsidy would be given in&#13;
the form of a voucher to be used against the purchase of coal, equivalent to the cost of 1 ton per&#13;
household per year. Based on an average retail price of 400 soms per ton of coal, the subsidy&#13;
would amount to 78 million soms.&#13;
24.   Electricity&#13;
All households rely on electricity mainly for lighting and household appliances, although&#13;
some households use it as a supplementary heating fuel. The impact of higher electricity tariffs&#13;
on core-urban households with gas will be low and for those without gas, would be moderate.&#13;
However, there is very limited scope for fuel substitution among core-urban households because&#13;
cheaper, alternative fuels are not available in urban areas. For semi-urban households with&#13;
access to natural gas, the impact of higher electricity tariffs will be moderate given their&#13;
relatively low level of electricity consumption. The most vulnerable segment are semi-urban&#13;
households without access to natural gas;  their electricity consumption is highest (212&#13;
kwh/month) among urban households --- nearly two times higher than semi-urban households&#13;
without gas.&#13;
25.   Many semi-urban households access electricity through illegal network connections, and&#13;
as a result, usage of this fuel has risen significantly. They also have limited scope for fuel&#13;
substitution and their capacity to adopt adequate coping strategies in an environment of&#13;
increasing fuel prices is seriously constrained by limited access to cheaper, alternative fuel&#13;
sources.&#13;
26.   Rural households will also be affected by higher tariffs in a major way because of their&#13;
high level of electricity consumption (Figure 4). While they have a broader scope for fuel&#13;
substitution given the relative availability of free or low-cost fuel sources such as firewood and&#13;
dung, rural households are beginning to experience the effects of increased demand on these fuel&#13;
sources. The survey data showed that 78% expressed the opinion that firewood was in great&#13;
shortage. Firewood is becoming increasingly scarce due to the limited forest cover. Similarly,&#13;
a declining supply of dung is likely because cattle production in the country has decreased in&#13;
recent years.&#13;
27.   Safety Net Provision for Low-income Electricity Users&#13;
To cushion the impact of higher electricity tariffs on low-income households, a lifeline&#13;
tariff of 15 tyins/kwh for the first 100 kwh/month consumed should be subsidized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

IV.   Subsidy Targeting&#13;
28.   The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP), which is currently administering&#13;
subsidies targeted to low-income households, will be responsible for implementing the proposed&#13;
subsidy scheme and social safety net. The technical assistance provided under the Social Safety&#13;
Net Project (SSNP) will help strengthen the operational capacity of the Ministry and refine&#13;
currently used methods of targeting.&#13;
29.   Eligible residential customers would be required to submit an application for energy&#13;
subsidy to the MLSP's field offices. Applications will be reviewed based on income test&#13;
procedures currently applied in the Common Monthly Subsidy scheme which targets households&#13;
with per capita incomes below 68 soms per month. Approved applications would be reviewed&#13;
every 12 to 18 months to ensure that eligibility requirements are maintained. These procedures&#13;
will apply to both the district heat and natural gas subsidy scheme.&#13;
30.   The subsidy for low-income district heat and natural gas consumers would be given in&#13;
the form of coupons to pay for heating and hot water and gas bills, respectively. Coupons are&#13;
to be given directly by the beneficiaries to the appropriate utility providers to ensure that subsidy&#13;
payments are used specifically for heating and gas bills. The distribution of vouchers for the&#13;
purchase of coal will be handled by the MLSP through its social assistance offices.&#13;
3 1. Participation&#13;
Public participation is essential for this proposed social safety net and subsidy scheme. The&#13;
objectives of a participatory approach are to (i) inform the public appropriately, (ii) consult&#13;
beneficiaries and other stakeholders in order to facilitate qualified contributions from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77                                                                           Annex 2.6&#13;
grassroots level and specialized independent entities, and (iii) enable supervision, monitoring,&#13;
and control by the public. To achieve those objectives, the MLSP as the executing agency of the&#13;
safety net operations would conduct public hearings on the safety net prior to its implementation.&#13;
The public hearings should be carried out both at the central level and the Ministry's field&#13;
offices in charge of social assistance. Follow-up hearings should be undertaken, preferably after&#13;
three to four months, to monitor implementation and gather feedback from the public.&#13;
Specifically invited to the hearings, particularly at the central level, would be NGO&#13;
representatives and independent specialist. In addition to the public hearings, the public would&#13;
be periodically informed through the media on payments carried out, number of beneficiaries&#13;
targeted as well as the effectiveness of administrative procedures adopted. This approach would&#13;
facilitate appropriate information flow, two-way communication with beneficiaries, as well as&#13;
contributions, supervision, and monitoring from a wide range of stakeholders.&#13;
32.   Total Cost, Financing, and Inmplementation Schedule of the Subsidy&#13;
The total direct subsidy for consumers of district heat, natural gas, and coal would&#13;
amount to 150 million soms per year (district heating and hot water customers 56 million;&#13;
natural gas customers 16 million; coal, firewood and dung users 78 million users). Financing&#13;
of this subsidy could come from an additional tax on gasoline. Considering a consumption of&#13;
gasoline for 1994 of 300,000 tons (375 million liters), the additional tax would be 0.4 soms per&#13;
liter, over the current retail price of about 3.2 soms per liter.&#13;

ANNEX 2.7&#13;
COST OF ELECTRIC HEATING&#13;
1.    Electric heating is a comfortable form of heating but could turn out to be highly&#13;
expensive to the economy. Electricity is a high quality form of energy, which, per&#13;
effective heating Gcal, is much more costly than other fuels as indicated below. The table&#13;
shows that from an economic point of view using electricity for heating is three times as&#13;
expensive as coal and natural gas. However, from a financial point of view, domestic&#13;
prices of coal and natural gas are very high compared with electricity. Hence,&#13;
households and public institutions have started to use electricity for heating purposes on&#13;
a large scale, resulting in very high growth rates of electricity consumption.&#13;

2.    The consumers have not only reacted to distorted financial prices, but also to an&#13;
explicit Government policy that aims to substitute domestically produced electricity for&#13;
imported oil, coal, and natural gas. This policy may be misguided. In substituting&#13;
electrical heating for fossil fuels, the Kyrgyz Republic would spend significantly more&#13;
in economic terms for its energy needs given the marked difference in relative economic&#13;
prices. An additional, very serious problem is that the power distribution network is not&#13;
designed to accommodate the additional load for electric heating, about 10-12 kW per&#13;
house, all of which in winter.&#13;

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
POWER AND DISTRICT HEATING REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 3.3&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
KYRGYZ POWER SECTOR AND KNEHC:&#13;
SECTOR STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE&#13;
I.    BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Kyrgyz power system comprises 18 hydroelectric plants (altogether 2,774 MW); two&#13;
combined heat and power plants (altogether 659 MW); a number of heat only boilers; 500-kV&#13;
lines (541 km), 220-kV lines (1,009 km), 110-kV lines (4,301 km), 35-kV lines (4,172 km), and&#13;
more than 60,000 km of low voltage distribution lines. The sector supplies electricity to about&#13;
975,000 consumers, of which 950,000 are residential, the balance being agricultural,&#13;
administrative and industrial consumers. Further, it supplies heat (steam and hot water) to five&#13;
urban centers in the country, primarily for residential, administrative and industrial uses.&#13;
2.    Following independence, the Government entrusted a single joint stock company with&#13;
the ownership and operation of the power system. The present organization goes back to 1994,&#13;
when the holding concept was introduced and the company renamed the Kyrgyz National Energy&#13;
Holding Company (KNEHC). Under a holding company structure 1, KNEHC operates nineteen&#13;
main "enterprises" of which sixteen are entrusted with power generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution; district heating; operation and maintenance; stores and training. Of the remaining&#13;
three "enterprises" which are actually joint stock companies, two are involved in construction&#13;
and one in the production of prefabricated concrete structures. KNEHC has attempted to divest&#13;
these non-core businesses, but with little success thus far.&#13;
3.   In line with the country's privatization efforts in other sectors, the Govermnent has&#13;
expressed interest in privatizing the power sector and has considered various options in this&#13;
respect. Following discussions with donors, the Government has recognized the unique aspects&#13;
of the power sector, and has decided to defer privatization until the various options have been&#13;
thoroughly analyzed and the necessary steps precedent to privatization taken.  Sector&#13;
reform/restructuring and commercialization of existing operations are important prerequisites to&#13;
privatization. The present technical assistance, together with on-going efforts noted below, is&#13;
designed to address these issues.&#13;
4.    The relevant on-going technical assistance actions on institutional aspects include:&#13;
(i)    a draft framework law for energy and a draft electricity law have been prepared&#13;
under the aegis of EU-TACIS and USAID and will have to be discussed and finalized.&#13;
This new legislation will provide for licensing and regulation of the power sector, thus&#13;
helping to create an enabling environment for private sector participation; the energy law&#13;
Which functions more as the headquarters of a company, than as a holding company&#13;
concerned with managing its investment portfolio in subsidiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3                                                                         91&#13;
will also provide for an independent regulatory agency that would enforce the rights and&#13;
obligations of the respective parties. In addition, the now terminated Energy Advisory&#13;
Group funded by EU-TACIS has submitted various reports concerning inter alia&#13;
commercialization of KNEHC;&#13;
(ii)   complementary  assistance  from  USAID  will assist the  Government in&#13;
implementing the new legislation, particularly setting up, staffing and initiating operation&#13;
of the regulatory agency and preparation of model contracts/agreements and secondary&#13;
legislation;&#13;
(iii) under JECF financing, EBRD is assisting KNEHC to establish a commercial&#13;
management system, including modernization of KNEHC's financial practices to bring&#13;
them into conformity with international accounting standards, introducing cost accounting&#13;
and financial management information systems, and implementing the above&#13;
practices/systems and training staff in their use;&#13;
(iv)   assistance from ADB will comprise a power and heat tariff study, a revaluation&#13;
of assets study, and associated staff training.&#13;
5.    Close liaison with these on-going tasks will be necessary to avoid duplication of efforts&#13;
and ensure complementarity of proposed actions and responsiveness to the requirements of the&#13;
sector and KNEHC.&#13;
II.   OBJECTIVES AND APPROACH&#13;
6.    The primary objectives of this technical assistance effort are to help the Government:&#13;
(i) develop an overall strategy for restructuring the power/heat sector with a view to&#13;
improving sector efficiency and reliability/quality of supply, reducing the drain on the&#13;
national budget and opening the way to private sector involvement; and&#13;
(ii) begin to implement this strategy through restructuring and commercialization of&#13;
KNEHC.&#13;
7.    Within KNEHC, the primary focus would be on: (i) KNEHC's legal statutes and&#13;
subsidiaries; (ii) the organizational framework and exercise of management/control over the&#13;
subsidiaries; (iii) the financial structure and performance; (iv) staffing and manpower&#13;
management; and (v) management information systems.&#13;
8.    The study will be carried out in three phases: (a) Task-A: sector strategy formulation;&#13;
(b) Task-B: diagnostic study of KNEHC; and (c) Task-C: implementation of recommendations.&#13;
The first two phases will proceed in parallel, with detailed work on the diagnostic phase&#13;
proceeding only after preliminary agreement has been reached on the long-term structure for&#13;
the power/heat sector. Execution of the third phase will be subject to agreement on the detailed&#13;
findings of the diagnostic phase and proposed plan of action prepared by the consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
92                                                                           Annex 3.3&#13;
III. SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
9.    Task - A. - Sector Strategy Formulation&#13;
The consultants will define the structural and implementation details for the sector's&#13;
transformation under KNEHC. This will involve clarification of the applicable principles and&#13;
organizational options for sector reform and modernization to achieve the Government's&#13;
objective of moving administration of the power/heat sector from a central planning mechanism&#13;
to one which is more market oriented.&#13;
10.   The consultants will review the options for the longer term organization of the sector&#13;
with a view to recommending a structure that promotes operational efficiency, efficient&#13;
investment, reliability and quality of supply, accountability to the owners of its capital, efficient&#13;
use of electricity and district heating, and which takes into account the needs of consumers. The&#13;
current and planned organization of the power/heat sector and existing plans for its restructuring,&#13;
commercialization, corporatization and privatization will be reviewed. The preliminary findings&#13;
of the diagnostic study below will provide important inputs to this process in terms of identifying&#13;
the problems and constraints of the present system. The consultants will also coordinate closely&#13;
with the on-going legal and regulatory work (para. 4) in making their recommendations.&#13;
11.   Separation of power and heat activities, and unbundling of power into generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution will be among the restructuring options to be considered.&#13;
Divestiture of assets/activities and scope for private sector participation, including independent&#13;
power producers and local distributors, will also be considered. Criteria for evaluating the&#13;
various options in the Kyrgyz context will be developed and used in assessing the options.&#13;
12.   The consultants will develop 2-3 alternative structures for discussion with the&#13;
Government, KNEHC and concerned donors in a workshop; these will also be presented in the&#13;
form of an interim report. Once the basic structure is agreed, the consultants will prepare an&#13;
outline plan for carrying out the restructuring including the transitional stages.&#13;
13.   Task - B. - Diagnostic Study of KNEHC&#13;
The diagnostic study of KNEHC will proceed in parallel with Task-A above. At the&#13;
same time, the recommendations on restructuring KNEHC and improving its organization and&#13;
management will take into consideration the longer term structure of the sector. In performing&#13;
Task-B, the consultants will address inter alia the following:&#13;
(a)   Legal Framework&#13;
14.   The consultants will examine the general legal framework in Kyrgyz Republic governing&#13;
corporations, state enterprises, and the power sector. The consultants will also examine the&#13;
statutes of KNEHC and its subsidiaries. The consultant will study in particular:&#13;
(i)   the exercise of ownership (at the level of the holding company and of the&#13;
subsidiaries);&#13;
(ii)  the formulation and implementation of corporate policies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3                                                                          93&#13;
(iii)  the division of powers between the owners (through the General Assembly, the&#13;
Council and the Board) and the managers; and&#13;
(iv)  the role and function of the State Auditors and the Auditing Commission.&#13;
(b)   Organizational Framework and Subsidiaries' Control&#13;
15.   KNEHC's organization chart appears at Annex 1. In addition to the heads of subsidiaries,&#13;
eleven individuals report to the President of the company, including two Vice Presidents (one&#13;
in charge of technical operations, the other of administrative and commercial aspects); four&#13;
Executive Directors oversee capital construction, external relations, maintenance and&#13;
development planning; and five Department Heads in charge of fairly small units (personnel,&#13;
accounting, economics, finance, security). This structure is unusual in that a large number of&#13;
individuals report to the President. Further, certain functions such as financial management are&#13;
delegated to a large number of independent units.&#13;
16.   The consultants will investigate in detail:&#13;
(i) the performnance of the organization under the present structure;&#13;
(ii)  the control exercised by the holding company over the subsidiaries together with&#13;
that exercised by functional managers (such as technical, commercial, financial etc.);&#13;
(iii)  the appropriateness of the framework to introducing company-wide policies; and&#13;
(iv)  the adequacy of the present manuals and management orders ("ukases").&#13;
(c)    Financial Structure and Performance&#13;
17.   KNEHC's balance sheet has a number of unusual features, in particular: (i) fixed assets,&#13;
at some US$37 million, are considerably undervalued for a utility with about 3,400 MW&#13;
generating capacity and a well-developed transmission and distribution system; (ii) work in&#13;
progress is probably understated as major construction works on Kambarata-2 have been&#13;
abandoned midstream; and (iii) it has virtually no long term debt as funds for all investments&#13;
under the FSU were supplied as Government equity. In commercializing KNEHC's operations&#13;
and preparing for the longer term restructuring of the sector, these issues together with&#13;
establishment of adequate standards of financial performance need to be examined.&#13;
18.   The consultants will incorporate the results of the assets revaluation study (para. 4 above)&#13;
and address inter alia the following considerations in the financial restructuring of KNEHC:&#13;
(i)   adding debt to the balance sheets (long-term debt from Government in place of&#13;
equity) and requiring KNEHC to service the debt, as is typical of utilities elsewhere in&#13;
the world;&#13;
(ii)   setting dividend targets to ensure a return on government equity;&#13;
(iii)  using financial targets to drive tariff increases; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94                                                                        Annex 3.3&#13;
(iv)  separating the various operations, e.g., district heating and power supply and&#13;
generation, transmission and distribution, and establishing cost/profit centers accordingly.&#13;
(d)   Staffing and Manpower Management&#13;
19.   KNEHC and its subsidiaries employ in excess of 15,000 staff. By international standards,&#13;
the company seems to be considerably overstaffed, with about 70-80 staff per connection. This&#13;
can be explained by the large number of construction personnel now idle, relatively low level&#13;
of computerization, and excessive parceling of job descriptions.&#13;
20.   The consultants will examine the current practices of KNEHC in terms of personnel&#13;
management, salaries and benefits, training, career development, advancement and terminations.&#13;
They will also investigate the extent to which available positions are documented through job&#13;
descriptions, and the approach adopted by KNEHC in matching individuals with positions. They&#13;
will also investigate the policy followed to adapt the profile of personnel to the requirements of&#13;
a modem electric power and district heating utility using the advanced tools of the industry. The&#13;
findings on the manpower study will focus on:&#13;
(i)   the articulation of a manpower strategy and policy;&#13;
(ii)  the re-definition of manpower requirements;&#13;
(iii)  the restructuring of salaries, benefits and other incentives;&#13;
(iv)  the preparation of job descriptions for senior and medium levels;&#13;
(v)   an assessment of the adequacy of the present and planned training programs in the&#13;
different disciplines in order to move from the present framework to the new one; and&#13;
(vi)  the elaboration of a strategy to reduce redundant staff to acceptable levels through&#13;
a social plan consistent with the policies in effect in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
(e)   Management Information Systems&#13;
21.   KNEHC does not have a well-designed management information system supplying its&#13;
management on a daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly basis with meaningful information which&#13;
would allow it to take appropriate action on a timely basis. Under separate terms of reference&#13;
(para. 4), consultants are in the process of designing and implementing a financial management&#13;
information system. In close cooperation with these consultants, the consultants under this study&#13;
should:&#13;
(i)   identify the main characteristics of suitable technical and financial management&#13;
information systems;&#13;
(ii)  suggest a number of alternatives, and their costs and benefits (including&#13;
compatibility with the computing tools in use at KNEHC); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.3                                                                       95&#13;
(iii) prepare detailed recommendations including the need to prepare organization&#13;
manuals and procedures and provide training of staff.&#13;
(f)    Diagnostic Study Findings/Action Plan for Implementation&#13;
22.   Following the diagnostic phase, the consultants will formulate a detailed report on the&#13;
conclusions of the diagnostic study together with recommendations. They will also prepare an&#13;
action plan indicating the recommended methodology and step-wise program to proceed with&#13;
implementation, as well as a matching schedule. If such implementation is subject to acquisition&#13;
of additional hardware/software, these should also be identified. The consultants should also&#13;
specify any measures to be taken by KNEHC/Government which are essential to allow smooth&#13;
implementation. In this respect, the consultants will also indicate the support required from&#13;
KNEHC in various areas. The consultants findings and recommendations will be presented and&#13;
discussed in a workshop involving key KNEHC personnel, government officials and concerned&#13;
donors.&#13;
23.   Task - C. - Implementation of Recommendations&#13;
Following Government and KNEHC's agreement on the program, the consultants will&#13;
proceed with the implementation of the recommendations in close collaboration with KNEHC&#13;
staff and in accordance with an agreed time schedule. The consultants will provide on-the-job&#13;
training to the maximum extent possible during the implementation phase. It is expected that&#13;
the consultants support will extend over a period of 18 months, with the presence of consultant&#13;
staff declining as the Kyrgyz counterparts take over.&#13;
24.   The consultants will provide monthly progress reports indicating the status of the different&#13;
activities versus the plan. The final report which will be a joint product of the consultants and&#13;
KNEHC will document the changes implemented, e.g., that the statutes of KNEHC and its&#13;
subsidiaries have been revised, the company has been reorganized and financially restructured,&#13;
the personnel function has been streamlined, appropriate operating manuals (organization and&#13;
personnel functions) and job descriptions have been introduced, a modern management&#13;
information system is in place, and that in general terms, the new systems are operating&#13;
satisfactorily. In addition, it will identify further actions for KNEHC in the context of the&#13;
overall restructuring of the power/heat sector.&#13;
IV.   ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY AND STAFFING&#13;
25.   The consultants will need to work closely with KNEHC and government officials&#13;
throughout the period of assistance, and will need to spend a major portion of their time in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic. Joint working groups should be formed for the various tasks. The details for&#13;
the organization of the work, including the composition of the working groups for the sector&#13;
strategy formulation and diagnostic study of KNEHC, will be specified in the inception report.&#13;
The focus of the Task-A (sector strategy) working group will be policy issues, hence requiring&#13;
expertise in power/heat sector restructuring, regulation and privatization. The focus of the Task-&#13;
B and Task-C working groups (diagnostic study and implementation) will be organization and&#13;
management  issues,  hence  requiring  expertise  in  business  management,  finance,&#13;
manpower/personnel, legal and information systems.  The foreign experts should have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
96                                                                      Annex 3.3&#13;
considerable experience in countries of the FSU and Central/Eastern Europe. Local consultants&#13;
should be used to the-maximum extent possible.&#13;
V.   IMPLEMENTATION AND DELIVERABLES TIMEFRAME&#13;
26.   The overall timeframe is estimated at 24 months, with deliverables as follows:&#13;
- inception report--month 1&#13;
- sector strategy formulation (duration 3 months)&#13;
- study--months 2-2.5&#13;
- interim report and workshop--end-month 3&#13;

ANNEX 3.4&#13;
ASSISTANCE IN BILLING AND COLLECrION DRAFr TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
KYRGYZ NATIONAL ENERGY HOLDING COMPANY (KNEHC)&#13;
I.    BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Kyrgyz National Energy Holding Company (KNEHC) owns and operates the power&#13;
system in Kyrgyzstan. This comprises 18 hydroelectric plants (altogether 2,774 MW); two&#13;
combined heat and power plants (altogether 659 MW); a number of heat only boilers; 500-kV&#13;
lines (541 km), 220-kV lines (1,009 km), 110-kV lines (4,301 kIn), 35-kV lines (4,172 kin), and&#13;
more than 60,000 km of low voltage distribution lines. KNEHC supplies electricity to about&#13;
975,000 connections, 97% of which are residential, the balance being made of agricultural,&#13;
administrative and industrial consumers. Furthermore, KNEHC supplies heat to four urban&#13;
centers in Kyrgyzstan, essentially for residential, administrative and industrial uses.&#13;
2.    Following independence, the Government entrusted a single company with the ownership&#13;
and operation of the power system. The present organization goes back to 1994, when the&#13;
holding concept was introduced. Under an holding company, KNEHC operates nineteen&#13;
"enterprises" of which sixteen are entrusted with power generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution; district heating; operation and maintenance (O&amp;M); stores and training. Two&#13;
"enterprises" are involved in construction; and one with the production of cement. KNEHC has&#13;
attempted to divest non-related businesses, but with little success thus far.&#13;
3.    The billing and collection system are, by and large, those inherited from the past. In&#13;
particular, the company largely relies on its household customers to read their meters and pay&#13;
accordingly. Furthermore, given the level of development of the banking system, cash collection&#13;
and management are less efficient than they ought to be.&#13;
4.   It is important to note that in parallel with this study: various agencies are providing&#13;
Technical Assistance to KNEHC (under the aegis of ADB, EBRD, EU-TACIS, and USAID)&#13;
including notably an organization study; an upgrading of the financial and accounting systems;&#13;
a pilot program to improve collection in rural areas; and tariffs. The consultant will need to&#13;
liaise, as necessary, with those engaged in these tasks to ensure that his proposals are responsive&#13;
to the requirements of the sector and of KNEHC.&#13;
5.    The main objective of this assignment is to upgrade the billing and collection cycle of&#13;
KNEHC for heat and electricity in the main markets. Thus, in the first stage the consultant is&#13;
expected to analyze the billing cycle (including meter reading, posting, invoicing, collecting,&#13;
updating records etc.) and formulate a detailed program for upgrading the system. He will also&#13;
set out the pre-requisites for the successful implementation of the program. The second phase&#13;
will consist in the implementation of the recommendations, following acceptance of the plan by&#13;
KNEHC.&#13;
&#13;

II.    DIAGNOSIS PHASE&#13;
6.    Organization of Billing Cycle&#13;
The consultant will examine how KNEHC and its main distribution affiliates are&#13;
organized in relation to meter readin-, billing, encashment, disconnection procedures, and&#13;
records maintenance. Given that KNEHC is involved in both electricity and heat supply, and&#13;
operates throughout Kyrgyzstan, and given further that such functions are entrusted to&#13;
distribution affiliates, the consultants will carry such diagnosis in areas representing at least 50%&#13;
of KNEHC's gross revenues.&#13;
7.    He will examine the main features of the process including inter alia the contractual&#13;
relationship between KNEHC and its customers;' the frequency of billing, meter reading,&#13;
payments; the distribution of bills, and the collection of revenues; the costs of meter reading and&#13;
bill processing; the accuracy of meter readings; the reporting of defective meters, suspected&#13;
thefts, and other abnormal situations; arrangements for meter repairs (in the Kyrgyz Republic,&#13;
meters are owned by the customers); the contents and quality of the bills, quality control&#13;
systems; responsiveness to consumer queries; the recovery of bad debts, connections-&#13;
disconnection procedures including deposits and guarantees; the monitoring of unaccounted for&#13;
electricity; cash registration, management and control; customer management and billing&#13;
software. The consultant will also examine the availability and performance of meters on&#13;
consumer premises, their reliability and accuracy, and make recommendations as appropriate.&#13;
8.    In the process, the consultant will also examine the various procedures in place, the&#13;
underlying manuals, as well as the effectiveness with which management orders ("ukases"), such&#13;
as the one issued March 20, 1995 are implemented.&#13;
9.    Supporting Hardware/Software&#13;
The consultant will examine the various means, computerized, and manual, which&#13;
KNEHC has at its disposal to handle billing and collection for heat and electricity. He will pay&#13;
particular attention to the recording of meter reading data, the emission of bills, the recording&#13;
of payments, the updating of customer records, the issuance of warning and disconnection&#13;
notices as well as the disconnection and reconnection process.&#13;
10.   Personnel Qualification&#13;
The consultant will examine the organization and staffing arrangements of the units in&#13;
charge of billing and collection in the affiliates visited. He will in particular assess how the units&#13;
are organized and supervised, how the work load is apportioned, how staff are motivated, and&#13;
how standards are maintained. He will in particular assess how the units are organized and&#13;
supervised, how the work load is allocated, how staff are motivated, and how standards are&#13;
maintained.&#13;
In this respect, the consultant will also investigate and make recomrnmendations on the legal framework&#13;
governing the relationship between KNEHC and its customers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.4                                                                          99&#13;
11.   Management Information Systems&#13;
The consultant will examine the weekly, monthly and quarterly management information&#13;
systems in place with regards to billing and collection for heat and electricity, and assess their&#13;
adequacy, accuracy, reliability and completeness.&#13;
III.  IMPLEMENTATION PHASE&#13;
12.   Following the Diagnosis phase, the consultant will formulate a detailed report spelling&#13;
out the conclusions of the diagnostic study together with recommendations. He will also submit&#13;
an action plan indicating the methodology and step-wise program he recommends to proceed&#13;
with implementation, as well as a matching schedule. The consultant should also spell out any&#13;
measure to be taken by KNEHC/Government which are essential to allow smooth&#13;
implementation. In this respect, the consultant will also indicate the support required from&#13;
KNEHC in various areas.&#13;
13.   The action plan will also, underscore the various hardware/software requirements, the&#13;
preparation of appropriate manuals and procedures (and their contents), the introduction of&#13;
appropriate data processing tools, and the training of the staff.&#13;
14.   Each major component of the consultant's recommendations should be predicated on a&#13;
broad assessment of its cost and benefits taking into account in particular the operating costs of&#13;
the current operation, the capital and operating costs resulting from the recommendations, and&#13;
the anticipated benefits in terms of higher collection levels on a timely basis.&#13;
15.   Following agreement with KNEHC's management and the Government, the consultant,&#13;
in close cooperation with company personnel, will proceed with the implementation of the&#13;
recommendations, in accordance with an agreed time schedule. In this context, the consultant&#13;
will be asked to provide monthly progress reports (in English and Russian) indicating the status&#13;
of the different activities vs. plan. By the end of the assignment, KNEHC will have to certify&#13;
that the billing and collection systems have been upgraded, that appropriate operating manuals&#13;
have been introduced, that a management information system is in place, and that in general&#13;
terms, the new systems are operating satisfactorily.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
POWER AND DiSrRcIT HEATING REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEx 4.2&#13;
PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONSULTING SERVICES: TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
I.    BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Kyrgyz electric power system is experiencing serious operating problems due to&#13;
overloading and insufficient development of its subtransmission and distribution network and the&#13;
lack of required rehabilitation and reinforcement of its facilities. The lack of rehabilitation has&#13;
persisted over five years and is affecting reliability of existing facilities. The major problems&#13;
are: (i) serious overloading of 110 kV subtransmission facilities and distribution networks&#13;
resulting in heavy losses, voltage drops, power outages and the failure of many transformers;&#13;
(b) low power factor value due to the lack of reactive supply capability on the subtransmission&#13;
and distribution systems; and (c) outdated system control and protection equipment threatening&#13;
system safety and reliability. Without an intensive rehabilitation of the system there is a real&#13;
risk of major breakdowns.&#13;
2.    The city of Bishkek has a district heating system which serves about half current&#13;
population of the city (estimated at 700,000 inhabitants), and process heat to industries. Most&#13;
of the heat is from a combined-heat-and-power plant TES-1 with a capacity of 609 MW and&#13;
1,820 Gcal/h. TES-1 has 24 boilers and 10 turbines some of which date back to the 1960's. The&#13;
plant need to be refurbished and upgraded in particular concerning instrumentation and control,&#13;
combustion efficiency and monitoring of emissions. The district heating network consists of 331&#13;
km double pipe comprising 157 km of transmission pipelines and 174 km of distribution&#13;
pipelines. The maximum operating pressure is 16 bars; the maximal temperature is 150 oC&#13;
with a return temperature of 70 oC.&#13;
3.    The district heating systems in the Kyrgyz Republic, as in most of the FSU, are&#13;
recognized to be relatively inefficient. The main causes are: (a) use of a constant flow, variable&#13;
temperature system with no temperature control or metering at the user end; (b) greater reliance&#13;
on HOBs which should be used mainly for peaking, and use of old and obsolete equipment&#13;
combined with inadequate maintenance; and (c) use of transmission and distribution network&#13;
technology which leads to low life expectancy and high water and heat losses. Heat losses&#13;
climbed to 19% in 1994, from 7% in 1990-91, due in large part to lack of maintenance in recent&#13;
years and the deteriorated condition/age of some parts of the country's DH heating system.&#13;
Given the high cost of fuel, KNEHC and the Government recognize that improvements in the&#13;
operational efficiency of the DH system are essential to ensure efficient and cost effective&#13;
delivery of heating services particularly in Bishkek.&#13;
4.    The objective of the project is to assist KNEHC to carry out rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of existing power system and district heating facilities in order to improve overall&#13;
quality of supply and reliability, reduce occurrence of outages and losses and enhance the&#13;
efficiency of energy supply. The project would assist in urgently needed rehabilitation and&#13;
upgrading of transmission, distribution, district heating and power plant facilities in Bishkek and&#13;
other major load centers where the need is most urgent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
105                                                                      Annex 4.2&#13;
II.   PROJECT DESCRIPTON&#13;
5.    The Power and District Heating Rehabilitation Project consists of:&#13;

upgrading the instrumentation and control equipment; installing emission monitoring&#13;
devices; and improving the ash handling system;&#13;
(ii)   district heating (DH) system rehabilitation: replacing the corroded network&#13;
sections (about 20 km) and insulation on the aerial sections; installing variable speed&#13;
pumps to convert the system to variable-flow operation from the present constant-&#13;
flow/variable temperature operation;&#13;
(iii) reconstruction and upgrading of selected facilities in the transmission and&#13;
distribution (T&amp;D) system throughout the country (list attached as Annex 1).&#13;
III.  ENGINEERING AND PROCUREMENT&#13;

services to assist KNEHC in detailed design and engineering for the refurbishment of TES-1,&#13;
and the rehabilitation and upgrading of the transmission and distribution facilities. ADB is&#13;
providing technical assistance for the detailed design and preparation of bidding document for&#13;
the district heating rehabilitation. Engineering for rehabilitation works of TES-1 are being partly&#13;
carried out by KNEHC' s engineers. Procurement of goods and services for the above project&#13;
components financed by the World Bank and ADB would follow respectively procedures set out&#13;
by the World Bank and ADB.&#13;
IV.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
7.    The project covers part of the rehabilitation and retrofitting program of KNEHC'&#13;
transmission and distribution systems and district heating for the period 1996 to 2000. KNEHC&#13;
would be responsible for the execution of the project. A Project Implementation Unit will be set&#13;
up under KNEHC's management and be responsible for the execution of the three components.&#13;
An office of PIU , responsible for day to day management of the unit, will be established. The&#13;
PIU  would be assisted by consultant services under these Terms of Reference.  The&#13;
implementation of the sub-components would be the responsibility of local KNEHC's units under&#13;
the PIU's supervision. Procurement would be centralized and carried out by the PIU in&#13;

ANNEX 4.3&#13;
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION - PHASE C&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
KYRGYZ NATIONAL ENERGY HOLDING COMPANY (KNEHC)&#13;
I.    BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    As a land-locked country with limited supply options, the Kyrgyz Republic has been&#13;
dependent on Kazakhstan, Russia and Uzbekistan for most of its requirements in fossil fuels.&#13;
Consumption of oil products and natural gas in 1993 was respectively about 0.9 million tons&#13;
and 1.3 billion m3, a significant reduction from the 1990 level of 2.7 million tons of oil products&#13;
and 2.1 billion m3 natural gas. Currently, the Kyrgyz Republic imports in excess of 90% of&#13;
its petroleum products and natural gas requirements. Energy products account for half of the&#13;
imports from the FSU. The short term outlook remains unfavorable as the expected increase&#13;
of natural gas prices to world levels would further deteriorate the energy trade balance. At&#13;
international prices and 1993 volumes, oil and gas imports would cost over US$200 million per&#13;
year.&#13;
2.    Oil and gas production in the Kyrgyz Republic is concentrated in the Fergana Valley in&#13;
the south from structures that extend westward into Uzbekistan. Production which amounts to&#13;
less than 100,000 MT/year of crude and 70 million m3 of natural gas from about 400 wells.&#13;
A comprehensive program for production-rehabilitation in the Fergana basin together with&#13;
renewed exploration in the basin, is believed to be essential for increasing production. At present&#13;
crude is processed in the Fergana refinery in Uzbekistan but the processing fee is reported to&#13;
be high.&#13;
3.    The territory of Kyrgyz Republic includes margins of two petroliferous provinces,&#13;
Fergana Basin and Chu-Sarysu Basin which are shared with Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan,&#13;
respectively. The Fergana intermontane basin is bounded by major faults that separate it from&#13;
the mountains to the north and south. Traps are anticlinical and many of the anticlines are fault-&#13;
related folds (with faults possibly playing a part in confining oil pools). Reservoir rocks are&#13;
represented largely by Paleogene sandstones. As late as few years ago Fergana Basin was&#13;
considered to be a mature oil producing region. However, recent discoveries in neighboring&#13;
Uzbekistan may represent the beginning of rejuvenating of this oil and gas province (although&#13;
new prospective reservoirs are associated with depths of more than 5 km and abnormally high&#13;
formation pressures). The Kyrgyz part of the Chu-Saryusu basin may also contain sizable&#13;
petroleum reserves as it is believed to be highly prospective for gas and possibly oil on the&#13;
territory of Kazakhstan.&#13;
4.    During the Soviet era, oil exploration in the Kyrgyz Republic was not a priority, given&#13;
plentiful resources in other republics. Consequently, comprehensive geological and geophysical&#13;
work was carried out for the most part in the Fergana valley so that several potentially&#13;
promising oil provinces have yet to be explored. The Alai basin, in the extreme south of the&#13;
republic, a mountainous region bordering Tajikistan, is the only area where considerable seismic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
109                                                                           Annex 4.3&#13;
work has been carried out; the single well drilled in that basin had an encouraging show. Other&#13;
potentially promising areas are the Chui Valley, west of Bishkek, and the Aksai Valley south&#13;
of Issyk Kul Lake, close to China..&#13;
5.    Because of the lack of risk capital, equipment and technology, the Government has&#13;
concluded that it needs to attract international oil companies with the requisite resources to&#13;
undertake an petroleum exploration and development efforts, as well as to increase the recovery&#13;
of oil from producing areas. In this respect, a promotional effort, in 1994, had no positive&#13;
results, but was probably premature. Several issues have be addressed: (i) the landlocked nature&#13;
of the country and its remoteness are likely to increase exploration expenditures; (ii) petroleum&#13;
prospectivity is uncertain and is subject to inter alia additional data acquisition and processing;&#13;
and (iii) the available exploration and production data need to be gathered and processed in order&#13;
to be able to present a comprehensive picture to industry. Furthermore, in spelling out an&#13;
exploration strategy, one will have to consider: (i) preparing different types of packages for the&#13;
mature Fergana Basin and for other, less explored and unexplored areas; (ii) the size of&#13;
exploration blocks on the basis of prospective risk/reward for each area; and (iii) model work&#13;
programs tailored area wise.&#13;
6.    A successful promotion will also depend on progress in the establishment of an&#13;
accommodating investment framework, i.e. adequate petroleum prices, reasonable taxation,&#13;
acceptable legislation and appropriate institutional arrangements. Until such a framework is&#13;
put in place, any effort would need to precisely spell out the relevant applicable regulations.&#13;
II.   WORK UNDERTAKEN IN PHASE A AND B&#13;
7.    The assignments already being undertaken in Phase A and B include:&#13;
(i)    Under Phase A&#13;
(a) assessment of the existing exploration geological and geophysical data; and&#13;
(b) assessment of data from producing fields;&#13;
(ii)   Under Phase B&#13;
(a)   an improved oil recovery study of existing producing basins;&#13;
(b)   geochemical analyses of drill cuts and source rock;&#13;
(c)    basin modeling; and&#13;
(d)   reprocessing of selected seismic lines.&#13;
8.     Once Phase B has been successfully completed, the work that would lead to the actual&#13;
promotion of the basins as defined in the previous phases, will be carried out under Phase C&#13;
which is the subject of these terns of reference. The scope of work of Phase C will include:-&#13;
(a)    basin analysis;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.3                                                                           110&#13;
(b)   preparation of promotion stately; and&#13;
(c)   implementation of the promotion strategy.&#13;
9.    Basin Analysis. The consultant will prepare a report on the overall exploration potential&#13;
of the Kyrgyz Republic. This report will draw information from phases A and B with particular&#13;
reference to: (i) the geographic spread and quality of available and reprocessed seismic and well&#13;
data: (ii) stratigraphic analysis and hydrocarbon maturity analyses, and known hydrocarbon&#13;
indications in the Kyrgyz Republic; and (iii) geological and production data from existing fields.&#13;
This report will summarize the potential for new discoveries of oil and gas in structures related&#13;
to existing discoveries, where exploration risk can be minimized. Further, basins will be ranked&#13;
in terms of their potentate to generate recoverable hydrocarbons, and the data used to generate&#13;
an overall exploration strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
12.   Development of exploration promotion strategy. The main activities will include:&#13;
(i)    Development of promotional strategy: a report will be prepared which discusses&#13;
the alternatives of the promotion campaign. The consultant will take into account the&#13;
potential of the basins as well as the legal and fiscal frameworks. The consultant will&#13;
estimate the level of interest that can be expected from oil companies. Recommendations&#13;
will be made on the best form of promotion to attract and target potential investors;&#13;
(ii)   Preparation of data packages: the consultant will produce a data package&#13;
containing data from the areas to be promoted. The data package will contain location,&#13;
well test, and production data in a form such as film, paper or digitally on magnetic tape,&#13;
as deemed appropriate; the data package will also include a technical report and a data&#13;
catalogue of the blocks.&#13;
13.   Imnplementation of the promotion strategy. If it is confirmed to be the best option, the&#13;
consultant will organize and advertise the holding of two international promotional seminars.&#13;
In addition the consultant will make every effort to advertise the promotion through direct&#13;
contacts with interested clients world wide. The consultant will prepare a data package License&#13;
and Non-Disclosure Agreement to be signed by oil companies to use the data, but will restrict&#13;
how the data is used by their employees.&#13;
14.   At the conclusion of the seminars, the consultant will provide a report that describes the&#13;
work undertaken and the results achieved. feedback will be provided from the oil companies,&#13;
where available, to give the Government a better understanding of the future investment potential&#13;
in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
III.   COUNTERPART ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
15.   Goskomgeologia and Kyrgyzneft, agencies representing GOK, will provide the Consultant&#13;
with free access to all technical data in their possession, office space, administrative staff as well&#13;
as assistance with local transportation within oil and gas exploration areas during all phases of&#13;
the project.&#13;

ANNEX 4.7&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
I.     BISHKEK TES-1 REHABILITATION&#13;
1.    Introduction&#13;
The Mission met with the representatives of the Kyrgyz National Holding Company (KNEHC)&#13;
and with officials of the State Committee on Environmental protection to discuss environmental issues&#13;
and concerns related to the Proposed Power District Heating Rehabilitation Project. The impacts of three&#13;
components were assessed and a summary of environmnental analysis in each areas along with&#13;
Environmental Management Plan are provided below.&#13;
2.    TES-1 combined heat and power plant has 24 boilers (only five (summer) to fifteen (winter)&#13;
working at a time) with a total installed capacity of 350 MW of electric generation, over 100 tons per&#13;
hour of steam production for export to industrial plants and 2,500 cubic meters of hot water production&#13;
for space heating and supply of hot water to the city of Bishkek. All boilers are equipped to burn coal,&#13;
oil and gas fuels. Availability of gas supply is uncertain because gas is being imported at a high cost.&#13;
The boilers are using low grade coal which contains 46% ash and is imported from Kazakhastan. The&#13;
plant produces the steam at 100 Atm and a temperature of 540 C. In a combined heat and power plant&#13;
(CHP), the thermal efficiency is about 75 to 80%. Due to small requirement of hot water heating during&#13;
the summer, the CHP operates mostly on gas and is supplemented by coal on as required basis.&#13;
3.    Environmental Aspects&#13;
The boilers are normally running at a very high air to fuel ratio which is contributing towards&#13;
a significant energy loss in flue gas. To avoid this problem and to optimize energy efficiency, it is&#13;
recommended that each operation should have a combustion analyzers to measure the amount of excess&#13;
oxygen in flue gas. The fuel to air ratio can be adjusted with respect to excess air monitored on a regular&#13;
basis. Later on when the cash flow situation improves, an automatic control system can be used to&#13;
optimize the boilers performance. These combustion analyzers are about six to eight thousand dollars&#13;
each and will provide a reasonable tool to adjust the air to fuel ratio for each boiler.&#13;
4.     Coal Storage Area&#13;
The lignite coal is being stored outside with no water cooling system provided in the storage area.&#13;
During the summer time, coal has a tendency to emit volatile gases such as methane which can ignite if&#13;
the temperature of the coal pile reaches high. It had happened a few times in the past and the fire is&#13;
extinguished within a short time. In order to protect the coal storage from fire, a water connection at&#13;
two or three locations along with long hoses is recommended so that it can cover the entire coal pile area.&#13;
5.    Disposal of Oily Water&#13;
A significant amount of cooling water being used for cooling the bearings, pumps and&#13;
machineries. The discharge from various operations contain some oil and other waste materials. At&#13;
present, the water is being discharged with ash. Eventually, this water goes to the river through a canal.&#13;
Since there is no wastewater treatment facility at the site, the oil from the water should be skimmed off&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.7                                                                                  121&#13;
before discharging with ash in order to prevent the oil from contaminating the canal and the river. The&#13;
skimmed oil should be disposed properly. There may be a need to have a small incinerator at the site&#13;
to burn oily wastes in order to protect the environment. All waste water is discharged by mixing with&#13;
ash and later it is used for irrigation and then discharge to the river. There is enough room at the ash&#13;
pond site to install a waste water treatment facility if it is required after conducting a thorough analysis&#13;
of wastewater discharges.&#13;
6.     Impact of High Ash Content in Coal&#13;
The coal/oil-fired boilers are equipped with electrostatic precipitators to remove ash up to 98 to&#13;
99 percent. To minimize ash content in flue gas, the boilers are supplemented with about ten to thirty&#13;
percent natural gas. Opacity meter in each duct work is recommended to determine the level of dust&#13;
concentration emitting into the atmosphere. There is a need for dispersion models to determine the&#13;
concentrations levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust in the surrounding areas. Ash is being&#13;
mixed with water and pumped to about eight kilometers to the ash pond, where ash is settled and water&#13;
is directed to the canal. Water from the canal is being used for irrigation and the remaining water goes&#13;
to the river. The bank has requested a detailed analysis of wastewater, coal and ash. Normally, ash&#13;
contains a number of hazardous compounds such as arsenic, mercury, chromium, nickel, copper, uranium&#13;
and other radioactive materials. Detailed analysis will determine the course of action needed to protect&#13;
the environment, health and safety of the people.&#13;
7.     Boiler Inefficiency&#13;
After visual inspection of the ash color at the pond, it appears there is a significant amount of&#13;
unburnt carbon left with ash. The reason for unburnt carbon is due to poor pulverization of coal. The&#13;
plant engineers have requested the management to provide new ball mills so that the coal can be&#13;
pulverized into fine particles for improved combustion. Due to lack of funds, the idea of installing the&#13;
ball mills has been dropped. Probably a single ball mill installed in the main coal feeder line before the&#13;
hammer mills may be a cost effective approach to improve the combustion efficiency. It will have some&#13;
impact on emissions reduction due to less amount of coal being used in the boilers. Further study is&#13;
required on this subject. Currently, hammer mills are having a high maintenance and the breakdowns&#13;
are frequent in the power plant. Coal/oil/gas-fired boilers are equipped with low NOx burners, which&#13;
will reduce NOx formation. Coal and heavy oil contain a high amount of sulfur which are contributing&#13;
towards high emissions of sulfur dioxides. There is no sulfur removal technology installed at the plant.&#13;
However, when all ducts are connected to a single tall chimney having a height of 300 meters, the impact&#13;
of sulfur dioxides emissions on the population will be reduced due to improved dispersion of sulfur&#13;
dioxides particles. It will minimize health impact to the surrounding population.&#13;
8.     Analytical Requirements&#13;
The chemical laboratory of the power plant is not well equipped. The laboratory provides a&#13;
routine water analysis of PH, BOD, phosphate, sulfate, nitrate etc. They do not have equipment to&#13;
measure metal contents in water and radioactive content of the ash. At a minimum, the laboratory needs&#13;
a chromatograph, spectrophotometer, mass spectrograph, and equipment for measuring particle size&#13;
distribution of ash, ultimate and proximate analysis of coal etc. A minimum amount of 150,000 dollars&#13;
is requested under the environmental management plan for conducting various key analysis in the power&#13;
plant on a regular basis. It will not only improve the environment but will also help in improving the&#13;
process operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
122                                                                                Annex 4.7&#13;
9.    Ash Disposal Site&#13;
Ash is flying throughout the ash disposal facility due to high activity of bulldozers and other ash&#13;
moving equipment. The ash disposal site contains about nine million tons of ash. At present, about&#13;
100,000 tons of ash is being sold to brick and cement industries. The total ash generated is in the range&#13;
of about 600,000 tons per year. It is suggested that if the ash is given away free, a number of users can&#13;
be attracted to take away ash and the disposal problems will be more manageable. There are several&#13;
hundred houses located adjacent to the ash pond. Although we understand that the people have illegally&#13;
built the houses very close to the pond, but there is a need to protect the welfare and health of the people.&#13;
One way to protect the ash flying in the housing development is to built a retaining wall of about ten feet&#13;
high followed by the trees planted in front of the wall. This can prevent the dust going in to the&#13;
community. Initially, we reconmmend that the power company KNEHC should only plant the trees&#13;
between the canal and the conmmunity in order to protect the people from ash inhalation and if the trees&#13;
do not provide enough protection then the retaining wall should be considered. At the ash disposal site,&#13;
a considerable amount of municipal and other power plant garbage is being dumped on both sides of the&#13;
road. There is a need to straighten out the dumps and the grass should be planted on each side of road&#13;
slopes. Furthermore, a water sprinkler systems to cover the entire area of ash pond would be desired&#13;
to minimize the disturbance of the dust into the atmosphere.&#13;
I.    DISTRICT HEATING&#13;
10.    Corrosion Control&#13;
The district heating lines are not protected from internal and external Corrosion. Most of the&#13;
district heating pipes are of schedule 40 to 80 pipes. Some of the old lines (about 25 years old) have&#13;
been corroded and need replacement. In this project, about seventeen kilometers corroded lines will be&#13;
replaced. There is a need to look at using the sacrificial or impressed current systems particularly for&#13;
those pipelines which are buried underground without any corrosion protection. Most of the underground&#13;
pipelines are installed in cement vault, where external corrosion problems will not be significant.&#13;
However, internal corrosion will remain a major problem and further investigation is needed to improve&#13;
deareation system or use of chemical protection system that will not harm the people using hot water for&#13;
domestic need.&#13;
11.   Asbestos&#13;
Most of the District heating and steam pipes are laid in underground concrete channel. At times,&#13;
the water is leaked through the cracks of concrete elements creating a problem of soaked insulation which&#13;
leads to high heat losses. This problem can be minimized by installing capacitance or resistance probes&#13;
with alarms at various locations, which can indicates the location of water leaks in the concrete channel.&#13;
This will allow to repair the leak within a short time in order to minimize heat losses. The metal casing&#13;
of the pipes are removed by the inhabitants leaving the insulation unprotected on the pipes. The power&#13;
company has provided the asbestos casing which has created an environmental hazard. Asbestos casing&#13;
for underground pipes will not have much impact on the environment. There are twenty kilometers of&#13;
above ground pipes that are coated with asbestos. Asbestos from above ground pipes will normally&#13;
disburse into the atmosphere quickly. However, there is a need to protect the environment by replacing&#13;
the asbestos coating for the above ground pipes with either a coat of mazut or a layer of cement mixed&#13;
with straw to protect it from cracking.&#13;

III.   Power Transmission And Distribution Reinforcement&#13;
12.   PCB&#13;
The rehabilitation of substations will include changing of old transformers, relays and other&#13;
components. The consultant on transmission component, American Electric Power Company, has taken&#13;
a few samples of the transformer oil to analyze for PCB in the United States. The analysis did not find&#13;
any PCB in the oil samples and, therefore, a PCB replacement program would not be required.&#13;
13.   Ala-Archa Substation&#13;
A new Ala-Archa Substation will be installed to provide a third independent bulk power supply&#13;
source to the city of Bishkek to improve its power supply reliability. The mission has visited the site of&#13;
the new substation and the right of way for the transmission lines and did not find that there would not&#13;
be any adverse impact on the environment. The transmission lines (20 km of a 220-kV double circuit&#13;
line) are passing through the mountains and flat land where the nearest town is about three kilometers&#13;
away. From the environmental point of view, the mission does not envisage any problem constructing&#13;
the transmission lines as shown in the drawing.&#13;
14.   Erosion&#13;
There was no erosion observed on the slopes near the substations and transmission lines. Ground&#13;
cover is properly maintained.&#13;
15.   Flora and Fauna&#13;
The impact of flora and fauna appears to be minimal.&#13;
16.   No herbicides are being used to the grass. The maintenance at substations and underneath the&#13;
transmission lines are conducted manually. The new transmission lines will pass through agriculture and&#13;
the mountainous areas, where disturbance to vegetation would be minimal. Temporary impacts will occur&#13;
during construction but with proper revegetation erosion could be minimized. There are no houses&#13;
located in the right of way of transmission lines. Post construction maintenance will occur only in a few&#13;
vegetated areas impacted during construction and will not create much disturbance to the environment.&#13;
17.   Land use impacts are minimized because the new lines will not pass through any housing&#13;
development or animal habitat. There will not be any potential health effects from electric and magnetic&#13;
fields because the transmission will not pass through any residential areas.&#13;
18.   Contamination of soils under the existing equipment was observed at two sub- stations where old&#13;
transformers and capacitors are being replaced. There is a need to scoop out the contaminated soil to&#13;
prevent the oil penetrating into the ground water. In addition, steps should be taken to minimize potential&#13;
contamination.&#13;
IV.   INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING&#13;
19.   In order to successfully implement the Environmental Management Plan, a proper training in&#13;
environmental monitoring, ensuring compliance requirements, review of design studies to ensure&#13;
environmental protection requirements, and to follow implementation plan would be essential to protect&#13;
the environment.&#13;
&#13;

V.    IMPLEMENTATION FOLLOW-UP&#13;
20.   Implementation of the Environmental Management Plan should commence immediately after loan&#13;
approval. Environmental considerations identified in this report should be followed. Schedule and&#13;
milestones for all major activities should be developed.&#13;
VI.   MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
21.   There is a need for monitoring prior to, during, and after completion of the construction.&#13;
Monitoring the implementation of environmental management recommendations should be reported to the&#13;
Hank in accordance with the loan requirements. Environmental monitoring should be reported every&#13;
quarter during the construction and even for one year after the facilities are operating.&#13;
&#13;

Appendix - 1&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN&#13;
The environmental management plan is based on the principles of prevention, minimization, mitigation,&#13;
and integration. Integration includes recommendations for establishing and coordinating a practical&#13;
framework to address the environmental issues for the power plants and district heating systems. The&#13;
goal of environmental management plan is not only to reduce environmental degradation from the&#13;
operations of the power plant and district heating systems but also to minimize the health and safety&#13;
impacts on the workers and also to develop a program of continuous environmental improvement in all&#13;
its activities.&#13;
Specific key mitigation measures for the proposed action are the following:&#13;
strengthen and maintain an environmental management system as a means of ensuring that the&#13;
effects of the operations of the organization conform to its environmental policy, objectives and targets,&#13;
and define responsibility for ensuring that the environmental requirements be implemented and&#13;
maintained; and&#13;
define and document the responsibility, authority and interrelations of key personnel who manage,&#13;
perform, and verify work affecting the environment.&#13;
Basic Minimum Environmental Requirements&#13;
A.    Power Plants:&#13;
o     Need for improvements and modifications to increase efficiency and to minimize&#13;
environmental emissions and degradation.&#13;
o     Improve environmental management of ash disposal site. In consultation with the&#13;
concerned community and Government entities, KNEHC should adopt a suitable plan to&#13;
protect the people from ash inhalation. This could include planting trees or building a&#13;
retaining wall, as appropriate. There is a need to straighten out the dumps and the grass&#13;
should be planted on each side of road slopes. Further, a water sprinkler systems to&#13;
cover the entire area of ash pond would be desirable to minimize the emission of the dust&#13;
into the atmosphere.&#13;
o     Investigate the need for waste water treatment unit and a proper disposal of oily water.&#13;
Since there is no wastewater treatment facility at the site, the oil from the water should&#13;
be skimmed off before discharging with ash in order to prevent the oil from&#13;
contaminating the canal and the river. The skimmed oil should be disposed properly and&#13;
there may be a need to have a small incinerator at the site to burn oily wastes in order&#13;
to protect the environment.&#13;
o      Develop a good analytical laboratory to analyze and monitor environmental parameters&#13;
for air and water pollution and disposal of solid wastes. At a minimum, the laboratory&#13;
needs a chromatograph, spectrophotometer, mass spectrograph, and equipment for&#13;
measuring particle size distribution of ash, ultimate and proximate analysis of coal.&#13;
o     Conduct a survey of amount of asbestos and define methods for proper removal and&#13;
disposal of asbestos during construction work on boilers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
126                                                                              Annex 4.7&#13;
B.    District Heating:&#13;
o      Need for a corrosion control to minimize leakage of district heating systems. The&#13;
existing methods of corrosion protection do not provide adequate protection for the&#13;
expected service life for underground pipelines. Internal corrosion will remain a major&#13;
problem and further investigation is needed to improve deareation system or use of&#13;
chemical protection system that will not harm the people using hot water for domestic&#13;
need.&#13;
o      Proper removal and disposal of asbestos. There is a need to protect the environment by&#13;
replacing the asbestos coating for the above ground pipes to protect it from cracking.&#13;
C.    Power Transmission and Distribution Reinforcement:&#13;
o     Conduct a survey and arrange for removal and disposal of contaminated soils from&#13;
leaking oil at substations and transformers.&#13;
D.    Institutional Building, Implementation, Monitoring and Reporting:&#13;
o     To strengthen and continue institutional building at KNEHC and carry out proper&#13;
implementation.&#13;
o      Need to develop monitoring and reporting requirements.&#13;
The proper implementation of the points listed above will not only improve the environment but will&#13;
enhance the health and safety of the workers and population.&#13;

ANNEX 5.2&#13;
AssuMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
A.    GENERAL&#13;
1.    This document spells out the main assumptions made in the financial model of KNEHC&#13;
(March 1996 version).&#13;
2.    The financial projections were prepared in Soms. Domestic inflation was assumed to&#13;
evolve as follows:&#13;
Assumed Domestic Inflation Rates&#13;
1995   1996   1997   1998   1999   2000&#13;
28.70% 15.00% 9.00% 4.10% 2.60% 2.60%&#13;
It was assumed that in future years, the exchange rate of the Som would remain constant&#13;
at Som 11.0 = US$1.00 (December 31, 1994 exchange rate is Som 10.65 = US$ 1.00).&#13;
3.     KNEHC's maintains its books in accordance with regulations issued annually by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. When the differences are material, certain accounts were restated to&#13;
conform with International Accounting Standards;' nevertheless, significant differences may&#13;
remain. KNEHC's accounts will be audited by recognized auditors, at which time more&#13;
meaningful data will be developed. The forecast, on the other hand, reflects international&#13;
accounting principles.&#13;
B.    INCOME STATEMENTS&#13;
4.    Operating Statements for Electricity and District Heating appear at Appendix 1.&#13;
a.    Electricity&#13;
5.    Revenues from electricity sales were derived from the Sales Forecast (in GWh), the&#13;
forecast of revenues per kWh in tyin, and the itemized calculation of revenues at Appendix 2.&#13;
One should note the following with respect to energy sales:&#13;
(i)   for the domestic market, the sales forecast is based on KNEHC data revised by the&#13;
mission;&#13;
In particular, accounts receivable are understated in KNEHC's books; overdue debt service charges remain&#13;
part of long term debt; and income is recognized when payment has been received.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
142                                                                          Annex 5.2&#13;
(ii)   for the export market, it is assumed that, in line with the agreement concluded for&#13;
1995, Kazakhstan will import annually 1,500 GWh at an average tariff of&#13;
US04.0/kWh (excluding a 20% VAT);&#13;
(iii)  the average revenues per kWh sold in the domestic market reflect the present&#13;
tariffs and increases whose magnitude appear at the bottom of the table;&#13;
(iv)   revenues from energy exports to China at 10 kV are at the fixed rate of 0.14&#13;
yuan/kWh. It was assumed that the yuan will decline by 10% a year against the&#13;
Som. Exports to China at 220 kV, for which an export contract is yet to be&#13;
finalized, were assumed to be priced at US¢3/kWh.&#13;
Regarding exports of regulation services, and spinning reserves, these were assumed to&#13;
increase from their 1994 level in accordance with inflation.&#13;
6.    The forecast of electricity generation appears at Appendix 3. It is based on KNEHC data&#13;
which was revised by the mission. One should note that "unaccounted for electricity" increases&#13;
steadily from 11% of generation in 1991 to 23% in 1995, and declines in subsequent years.&#13;
7.    In order to calculate the cost of fuels required for thermal power generation at Bishkek&#13;
and Osh (both being CHP plants), the mission assumed the heat rates at Appendix 4 (expressed&#13;
in g of coal at 4,000 kcal/kg). It was also assumed that the fuel mix in Bishkek would remain&#13;
stable at the 1995 level (coal - 65%, natural gas - 20%, fuel oil - 15%), and similarly that at Osh&#13;
it would remain at the level of 72% fuel oil and 28% natural gas. It was further assumed that&#13;
I ton of coal would be equivalent to 475 MCM of natural gas, and to 0.4 ton of fuel oil. The&#13;
calculation of fuel oil and coal quantities attributed to power generation appears at Appendix 4.&#13;
The prices offuels, based on KNEHC data, appear at Appendix 5. These were assumed to remain&#13;
constant, in US$ terms, at mid-1995 level throughout the forecast period. The total (i.e. electric&#13;
power and district heating) forecast consumption of fossil fuels appears at Appendix 5, and their&#13;
overall cost at Appendix 6.&#13;
8.    It was assumed that imports of electricity ceased in 1995.&#13;
9.    Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) expenses, Salaries and Wages, General and&#13;
Administrative (G&amp;A) expenses and Other Expenses, were all assumed to increase in accordance&#13;
with inflation.&#13;
10.   No separate forecasts were made for the depreciation of electricity and district heating&#13;
assets as no breakdown of fixed assets by category was available.&#13;
b.     District IIeating&#13;
11.   The detailed forecast of heat sales, of the heat tariffs and of heat revenues appear at&#13;
Appendix 7. Assumptions regarding tariff adjustments are at the bottom of the table.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.2                                                                       143&#13;
12.   The forecast of heat production appears at Appendix 7. It is based on KNEHC data. In&#13;
order to calculate the volume of fuels required for heat production at Bishkek and Osh (both&#13;
being CHP plants), the mission calculated the heat rates at Appendix 4. The prices of fels,&#13;
based on KNEHC data, appear at Appendix 5. These were assumed to remain constant, in US$&#13;
terms, throughout the forecast period. The total (i.e. electric power and district heating) forecast&#13;
cost offossilfuels appears at Appendix 6.&#13;
13.   Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) expenses, Salaries and Wages and General and&#13;
Administrative (G&amp;A) expenses were forecast to grow at the same pace as inflation.&#13;
C.     Consolidated Income Statements&#13;
14.   The consolidated Income Statements include additional provisions for other revenues, non-&#13;
allocated expenses, depreciation, interest and income tax.&#13;
15.   Regarding other revenues and non-allocated expenses, these originate from the sale of&#13;
cement and hot water to industry and their corresponding costs. It was assumed that these will&#13;
increase in accordance with inflation.&#13;
16.   Depreciation rates in effect for the main categories of assets are as follows:&#13;
Depreciation Rates in Effect&#13;
Dams                                  1.0%&#13;
Transmission Lines (35-220 kV)&#13;
Metal Poles                         2.0%&#13;
Wood Poles                          3.3%&#13;
Transmission Lines (4-20 kV)&#13;
Metal Poles                         3.0%&#13;
Treated Wood Poles                  4.0%&#13;
Untreated Wood Poles                6.0%&#13;
Transformers                          4.4%&#13;
Distribution Lines                    4.0%&#13;
Vehicles                              14.3%&#13;
It was assumed for the time being that the depreciation rates would be equivalent to 3%&#13;
of the average fixed assets in operation (the fixed assets in operation appear on the Balance&#13;
Sheets).&#13;
17.   The interest expense was derived from the Debt Schedule at Appendix 8.&#13;
18.   KNEHC is subject to Income Tax as follows: (i) a 0.8% tax on revenues billed; (ii) a&#13;
1.5% tax on the increase in accounts receivable; and (iii) a 30% tax on gross income from which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
144                                                                             Annex 5.2&#13;
the first two are deductible2. The model assumes that KNEHC pays income tax at the higher of&#13;
0.8% of revenues, and 30% of operating income less interest3.&#13;
C.    BALANCE SHEETS&#13;
19.   Cash was calculated on a residual basis.&#13;
20.   Accounts Receivable were calculated in terms of days of sale equivalent (see assumption&#13;
on bottom of Balance Sheets).&#13;
21.   Stocks were assumed to increase in accordance with the inflation from 1994 onwards.&#13;
22.   Additions to FixedAssets were derived from the Investment Program (Appendix 9). It was&#13;
assumed that all investments, except for major generation schemes and transmission lines would&#13;
be put into service the year the investments are incurred.&#13;
23.   Additions to Work in Progress reflect essentially the 1993 balance, and major investments&#13;
(generation and transmission lines) as they appear in the Investment Program at Appendix 9.&#13;
24.   Other Assets were assumed to remain constant throughout the forecast period.&#13;
25.   Short term borrowings were calculated on a residual basis.&#13;
26.   Accounts Payable include mostly fossil fuels, but also debts to contractors, and workers&#13;
involved in dams construction. They were assumed to be equivalent to accounts receivable.&#13;
27.   The Long Term Debt was derived from the Debt Schedule (Appendix 8). It was assumed&#13;
that KNEHC would be able to finance 70% of its investment program through external&#13;
borrowings (which appear as "Future Loans").&#13;
D.    SOURCES AND APPLICATIONS OF FUNDS&#13;
28.   The Sources and Applications of Funds Statements were derived from  the Income&#13;
Statements and Balance Sheets above. The investment program is at Appendix 9.&#13;
2  To the extent that KNEHC's assets are not revalued appropriately, the depreciation allowance is&#13;
understated, so that this tax penalizes the utility correspondingly.&#13;
3  In fact, income tax is based on the actual revenues reduced by the pro-rata share of expenses. This is&#13;
unjust, given that KNEHC operates in a highly inflationary environment, and that much of its receivables are of&#13;
a doubtful quality.&#13;

POWER AND DISTRICT HEATING REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 6.1&#13;
BISHKEK CHP PLANT AND DISTRICT HEATING SYSTEM&#13;
PROJEcT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A.    METHODOLOGY&#13;
1.    As the Bishkek CHP plant concurrently serves electric, district heating and process steam&#13;
requirements in Bishkek and surrounding areas, the project preparation consultants developed an economic&#13;
model during the feasibility study to simulate system operation. The model projected future system&#13;
operating costs based on dispatching of electric and thermal supply resources to concurrently serve power,&#13;
heat and steam loads while minimizing total energy (fuel and power from the grid) costs. The time&#13;
horizon for the study was 1995-2005 to enable the model to capture the effects of the proposed capital&#13;
investments and load growth to 2005; the analysis was extended to 2014 using a frozen load methodology&#13;
to enable end effects to be captured without obscuring the analysis with the effects of longer term load&#13;
growth and resulting capacity requirements. The model also examined the adequacy of production&#13;
resources to meet future loads and added new electric/thermal capacity if necessary (criteria for adding&#13;
new capacity: 15% reserve margin or largest unit out, whichever was more stringent).&#13;
2.     Four base cases were run using the model: (a) do nothing, except add new capacity if needed;&#13;
(b) Bishkek CHP plant rehabilitation; (c) Bishkek district heating system rehabilitation and modernization&#13;
which also allowed integration of the local DH system into the Bishkek DH system; and (d) Bishkek CHP&#13;
plant and DH system rehabilitation, i.e., cases (b) and (c) above combined. These cases were then re-run&#13;
assuming expansion of the market in the areas served by the local DH system, as these are newly&#13;
developing parts of the city which are expected to grow over the near-medium term. Under both&#13;
scenarios, the combined rehabilitation of the Bishkek CHP plant and DH system had the lowest net&#13;
present value of costs (capital, energy and O&amp;M); rehabilitation of the Bishkek CHP plant alone and of&#13;
the Bishkek DH system alone were also lower cost than the do nothing/without project alternative.&#13;
3.    In using the results of the preparation consultants' model to calculate the economic internal rate&#13;
of return of the individual project components and the two components combined, some adjustment in&#13;
the operation of the model was necessary. In those cases where there was no rehabilitation of the CHP&#13;
plant, the model added new generating capacity (a new 90 MW steam turbine, at a cost of about US$ 21&#13;
million installed); in the cases with rehabilitation of the CHP plant, no new capacity was needed.&#13;
Similarly in those cases where there was no rehabilitation of the DH system, and hence no integration&#13;
of the local DH system into the Bishkek DH system, the model added new heat production capacity for&#13;
the local system (a 50 Gcal/hr heat-only boiler, at a cost of about US$ 1.2 million); in the cases with&#13;
rehabilitation of the Bishkek DH system, no new capacity was needed. Under all cases above, there&#13;
would be sufficient capacity, allowing for retirements, to meet electric and thermal demand through 2014,&#13;
the period considered in the analysis.&#13;
4.    In calculating the EIRRs for the project, it is necessary to isolate the benefits which are directly&#13;
attributable to the project. For this, the preparation consultants re-ran the four cases assuming no capital&#13;
investments (other than project investments), but taking into consideration expected retirements. In the&#13;
cases of no CHP rehabilitation, installed capacity would fall below peak power demand in 2009, while&#13;
in the cases of no DH rehabilitation, installed capacity in the local DH system would fall below peak heat&#13;
demand in 2005; there would be no shortfall in meeting demand in the rehabilitation cases. Based on the&#13;
load duration curves, rough estimates were made of the unserved electric and thermal energy demand in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
146                                                                                    Annex 6.1&#13;
the no rehabilitation cases. Project benefits were then calculated as the difference between the energy&#13;
and O&amp;M costs with and without rehabilitation, plus the incremental sales valued at an estimated&#13;
willingness to pay. Except for the incremental cost of transmitting and distributing the additional electric&#13;
sales, production costs of the incremental demand served in the with rehabilitation cases are already&#13;
included in terms of reducing the energy and O&amp;M cost savings. It should be noted that this estimate&#13;
of unserved demand is very conservative, as it considers only the shortfall between peak demand and&#13;
installed capacity for the period of the peak without considering planned/forced outages.&#13;
5.     The preparation consultants' model also has some other shortcomings which tend to make it&#13;
conservative in terms of estimating project benefits. First, the model is considering only part of the&#13;
power system serving the country--that which serves Bishkek and surrounding areas. Bishkek is presently&#13;
able to import up to 200 MW additional capacity from the grid and export a similar amount. The&#13;
Bishkek CHP plant is mainly used in the winter when power demand is the highest, supply from the&#13;
country's hydro resources is restricted and there is a need for heat in Bishkek. Hydro constraints are not&#13;
considered in the model, which may lead to some underutilization of the Bishkek CHP plant and hence&#13;
underestimation of project benefits. Second, the model does not take into consideration that optimal&#13;
dispatching of district heat is now constrained by system operating conditions; introduction of variable&#13;
flow under the project will enable improved load dispatching using the HOBs as peak load units. Hence,&#13;
the cost savings due to the difference in HOB use in the with and without DH rehabilitation cases may&#13;
be understated. This said, the model provides a reasonable simulation of the operation of a complex&#13;
system, for use in estimating project benefits. The main assumptions are given below, followed by the&#13;
results of the EIRR and sensitivity analyses carried out during project appraisal. Full details of the model&#13;
are in the feasibility study in the project file.&#13;
B.    MAIN AssuMprIONS&#13;
6.     Investment Costs. Investment costs are the baseline project costs of the Bishkek CHP plant and&#13;
DH system rehabilitation components in 1995 constant prices and exchange rate'' plus an allowance for&#13;
implementation assistance (about 2.2%) and physical contingencies (about 10%); project costs are net of&#13;
customs duties and taxes. Expenditures are spread over 1996-99, the expected implementation period of&#13;
the project components. Project costs are given in detail in Annex 4.8.&#13;
7.     Production Costs. O&amp;M and energy costs for all electric and thermal generating plants (Bishkek&#13;
CHP plant, Bishkek DH system HOBs, local DH system HOBs) and for the district heating and process&#13;
steam distribution systems (Bishkek and local DH system) are incorporated in the preparation consultants'&#13;
economic model. O&amp;M costs include labor, materials and consumables. These have been estimated&#13;
based on the current practices and operating experience of the utility and the expected savings resulting&#13;
from rehabilitation and modernization under the project. All costs are in 1995 constant prices.&#13;
8.     Energy costs include fuel and power from the grid. For fuels, unit costs are based on the current&#13;
import prices including transport and excluding duties and taxes; these are: coal US$ 37/ton (US$&#13;
8.8/Gcal), natural gas US$ 77/1000 cubic meters (US$ 9.4/Gcal) and fuel oil US$ 100/ton (US$&#13;
10.5/Gcal). The Bishkek CHP plant mainly uses coal and lesser amounts of gas and oil, while the HOBs&#13;
use gas; the model results are not sensitive to fuel prices because the main benefit of the rehabilitation&#13;
is reduction in fuel use (rather than switching among fuels). Fuel efficiency and consumption parameters&#13;
1/ Project costs have been estimated assuming a constant nomimal exchange rate; since domestic inflation is&#13;
expected to be somewhat higher than international inflation for the next couple of years, the exchange rate would&#13;
appreciate in real terms. Given the small amount of local costs in the project (about 17%) and uncertainty about&#13;
the amount of real appreciation in the exchange rate, the economic analysis has been done in constant 1995 dollars&#13;
without taking the real appreciation into consideration. However, project EIRRs are sensitivity tested with increased&#13;
investment costs and remain acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.1                                                                                  147&#13;
are based on the current practices and operating experience of the utility and the expected changes in&#13;
performance resulting from rehabilitation and modernization under the project. The price of power from&#13;
the grid is based on current electricity export prices, or 3.0 UScents/kWh; a maximum of 200 MW is&#13;
assumed available to Bishkek (based on transmission capacity). This is used in optimizing load&#13;
dispatching and affects the amount of GWh generated by the Bishkek CHP plant; annual power generation&#13;
of the plant projected by the model is line with (or somewhat below) that expected to be required, based&#13;
on past experience and availability of alternative sources of supply (mainly hydro).&#13;
9.     The incremental production cost of serving the incremental demand in the rehabilitation cases is&#13;
mostly included in the reduced energy and O&amp;M savings in the with rehabilitation cases relative to the&#13;
without rehabilitation cases. For heat in fact, all costs can be considered to be included since heat&#13;
production and distribution costs are included in the economic model. For power, an additional cost&#13;
needs to be included for transmission and distribution; this is estimated as 20% of the long-run cost of&#13;
generation (3.7 UScents/kWh, see para. 5, Annex 6.2), or 0.7 UScents/kWh.&#13;
10.    Demand. Power and heat (district heating, hot water and process steam) sales forecasts for the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic are given in Annex 2.5. These are somewhat below estimates in the Bank's Energy&#13;
Sector Review in line with the Bank's current macro projections for the country; they also take into&#13;
consideration data for the first six months of 1995. For power, growth in sales is forecast to average&#13;
about 3% p.a. through 2005; faced with increasing power tariffs and a reversal of the Government's&#13;
policy of encouraging use of electrical resistance heating, it is expected that growth in residential&#13;
consumption will slow, while non-residential consumption will gradually increase in line with the&#13;
country's economic recovery. For heat, sales are expected to remain low for 1995 due to continued&#13;
rationing by KNEHC to conserve imported fuels, but should increase in 1996-97 to levels closer to&#13;
historical consumption but lower because some consumers will have switched to electrical heating and&#13;
because of increased attention on the part of KNEHC and the consumers to conservation. Over the&#13;
longer term, assuming the project goes ahead, it is expected that heat sales will remain relatively constant,&#13;
with sales to new consumers offset by improved system controls on heat supply (introduction of variable&#13;
flow) and reduced consumer wastage; reduction in network losses will further reduce the required heat&#13;
production to supply these sales.&#13;
11.    Forecasts used in the economic model are for the Bishkek area and are consistent with the above&#13;
forecasts. In the case of power, the demand forecast is the same for the with and without Bishkek CHP&#13;
plant rehabilitation cases. In the case of district heating, the demand forecast for the without Bishkek DH&#13;
system rehabilitation case is slightly higher than that for the with rehabilitation case because of the impact&#13;
of the rehabilitation and modernization works on efficiency of heat supply. The demand forecasts are&#13;
used in the economic model to calculate the production costs with and without rehabilitation, the&#13;
difference being the cost savings due to the project, and the estimated amount of incremental demand&#13;
served in the rehabilitation cases (para. 4). The forecasts are considered conservative.&#13;
12.    Willingness to Pay Valuation. Willingness to pay estimates are needed for valuing the incremental&#13;
power and heat demand which will be served in the with rehabilitation cases. Given the lack of data for&#13;
the key parameters needed to define such estimates, a simple approach has been followed. In the case&#13;
of power, the main alternative to electricity for residential consumers is kerosene lighting (29&#13;
UScents/kWh) and for non-residential consumers self-generation from captive diesel plants (13&#13;
UScents/kWh). Using these figures and the current tariff (0.82 UScents/kWh for residential and 1.64&#13;
UScents/kWh for non-residential consumers), a 0.33 demand curve demand curve coefficient, and 40:60&#13;
mix of residential and non-residential consumers, the estimated WTP for power is 4.7 UScents/kWh, or&#13;
about four times the current tariff. A similar analysis was done for heat, where in urban areas the main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
148                                                                                        Annex 6.1&#13;
alternative is individual gas burning boilers for apartment buildings and industrial plantsz' (US$ 29/Gcal&#13;
for apartment buildings and US$ 21/Gcal for industrial plants), current tariffs are US$ 5.5/Gcal for&#13;
residential and US$ 22.5/Gcal for non-residential consumers, and residential:non-residential consumer&#13;
mix is 60:40. Since the current non-residential heat tariff is about the same cost as alternative heat&#13;
sources, the current tariff was used as a proxy for the non-residential WTP in deriving an overall WTP;&#13;
this results in an estimated WTP for heat of US$ 15.7/Gcal, or about 1.3 times the current tariff. The&#13;
WTP estimates are low because of the low current tariffs, particularly for residential consumers.&#13;
C.     EIRR RESULTS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
13.    The comparative costs of the four cases--(a) no project/no investment, (b) Bishkek CHP plant&#13;
rehabilitation, (c) Bishkek DH system rehabilitation and modernization, and (d) Bishkek CHP plant and&#13;
DH system rehabilitation and modernization--are in Table 1. The cost and benefit streams and EIRR and&#13;
NPV calculations for the CHP plant and DH system rehabilitation, separately and combined, are in Table&#13;
2. The results of the sensitivity and breakeven analyses are in Table 3.&#13;
2/ Electrical resistance heating would not presently be technically possible because of the overloaded condition&#13;
of the transmission and distribution system.&#13;

POWER AND DISTRICT HEATING REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEx 6.2&#13;
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES&#13;
PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A.    METHODOLOGY&#13;
1.     During the feasibility study, the project preparation consultants developed load flow models for&#13;
the transmission and distribution systems serving the Bishkek area and a representative rural area (Kalinin&#13;
under the Chu Electric Company) to assist in identifying system needs, evaluating alternative&#13;
reinforcement schemes, and prioritizing investment alternatives. To the extent possible, these results were&#13;
extrapolated to assess the overall situation of the country's T&amp;D system. In addition, at KNEHC's&#13;
request, a supplemental study financed by the Swiss government carried out a detailed evaluation of the&#13;
220-kV interconnection between Kemin and Naryn. Based on these analyses and taking into consideration&#13;
budget limitations under the project, the consultants together with their counterparts in KNEHC selected&#13;
the least cost, highest priority T&amp;D components for inclusion in the project.  These include: (a)&#13;
construction of the 220/1 10-kV Ala Archa substation in the outskirts of Bishkek to relieve overloaded&#13;
lines/transformers at Glavnaia substation and provide a second transmission source to the city; (b)&#13;
construction of the 220/1 10-kV Naryn substation to complement completion of the 220-kV transmission&#13;
line interconnecting Kemin and Naryn (financed separately by EBRD) and to relieve overloaded&#13;
lines/transformers and significantly improve power supply to Kumtor gold mine and the Issyk-Kul and&#13;
Naryn regions; (c) installation of replacement or additional transformers in five substations (of various&#13;
voltages) to relieve system overloading; (d) installation of circuit breakers and associated improved relay&#13;
protection in twelve substations to improve system protection; and (e) provision of meters and other&#13;
essential tools. The full list of priority investments for northern Kyrgyz Republic, prepared during the&#13;
feasibility study, is attached as Table 1.&#13;
2.     Project benefits for the individual T&amp;D components were quantified based on the results of the&#13;
load flow simulation studies and system operating experience. Benefits quantified in the analysis include:&#13;
(a) reduced energy losses valued at the long-run cost of generation; (b) deferred generating capacity&#13;
additions (resulting from reduced system losses) valued at the capital cost of new generating capacity; and&#13;
(c) reduced frequency of outages valued at a conservatively estimated 20 UScents/kWh.  While&#13;
incremental sales (resulting from increased transmission capacity due to new and replaced transformers)&#13;
have been quantified and are a significant project benefit, they have not been included in the economic&#13;
analysis due to uncertainty in the demand forecasts and the low WTP due to the low current level of&#13;
tariffs (if included, they would be valued at the WTP less the long-run cost of supply); this results in a&#13;
conservative estimate of the potential project benefits. The time horizon for the study was 1995-2024,&#13;
or 25 years after completion of the T&amp;D rehabilitation and reinforcement work. Further details are&#13;
included in the project feasibility study and supplemental report (Kemin-Naryn interconnection) in the&#13;
project file; the main assumptions and results of the EIRR and sensitivity analyses carried out during&#13;
appraisal are given below.&#13;
B.    MAIN ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
3.    Investment and O&amp;M Costs. Investment costs are the baseline project costs of the individual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.2                                                                                  153&#13;
T&amp;D components in 1995 constant prices and exchange rate'' plus an allowance for implementation&#13;
assistance (about 2.2%) and physical contingencies (about 10%); project costs are net of customs duties&#13;
and taxes. Expenditures are spread over 1996-99, the expected implementation period of the T&amp;D&#13;
component. Project costs are given in detail in Annex 4.8. In the case of the Naryn substation, an&#13;
additional US$ 6.0 million is included in the investment costs in 1996 to account for the EBRD-financed&#13;
works (completion of Kemin-Naryn 220-kV transmission line, provision of 220-kV bay at Kemin and&#13;
construction of provisional 220/1 10-kV substation at Naryn); these works are expected to be&#13;
commissioned by end-1996 (in time to supply the Kumtor gold mine), and the permanent 220/1 10-kV&#13;
substation at Naryn (being financed under the present project and using all recoverable equipment from&#13;
the provisional substation) is expected to be commissioned in 1999. Incremental O&amp;M costs associated&#13;
with the T&amp;D component have been included in the analysis at I % of investment costs.&#13;
4.     Demand. As indicated in Annex 6.1 (para. 10), a power sales forecast for the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
is given in Annex 2.5. The forecast used in the load flow studies and quantification of project benefits&#13;
for the T&amp;D component is consistent with this forecast, where growth in sales is projected at about 3%&#13;
p.a. and growth in peak demand at 2-2.5% p.a. Important underlying assumptions to the forecast, in&#13;
terms of its impact on T&amp;D system requirements, are that fuel would be available to operate the Bishkek&#13;
CHP plant (supplies have been restricted in recent years due to high import prices) and there would be&#13;
no further increase in electrical heating. If this is not the case, increased overloading of the T&amp;D system&#13;
would be expected, with a risk of system collapse; at the same time, loss reduction and reduced outage&#13;
benefits from the project would increase.&#13;
5.     Power Supply Costs. Power supply costs are needed for valuing the loss reduction benefits of&#13;
the project in energy terms; the capital cost of new generating capacity is needed for valuing the loss&#13;
reduction benefits in capacity terms. Assuming a continuing mix of 85:15 hydro and thermal generation&#13;
in the Kyrgyz system, the average cost of new generation is estimated at 3.7 UScents/kWh (3.7&#13;
UScents/kWh for new hydro capacity based on the US$ 900/kW capital cost estimate for the next hydro&#13;
project; 3.6 UScents/kWh for new gas-fired CHP capacity installed at the TES 2 plant in Bishkek&#13;
(presently only HOB capacity) at an estimated cost of US$ 600/kW). In the economic analysis, 3.7&#13;
UScents/kWh is used to value the loss reduction benefits in energy terms. US$ 750/kW is used to value&#13;
the loss reduction benefits in capacity terms; to meet domestic needs, new capacity is not expected to be&#13;
needed before 2005 or so.&#13;
6.     Power Outage Costs. The addition of the Ala Archa and Naryn substations and installation of&#13;
improved system protection in twelve substations under the project are expected to result in reduced&#13;
frequency of power outages. In the case of the Ala Archa and Naryn substations, reduced outage&#13;
estimates are based on historical statistics for forced and planned outages in the Bishkek and Naryn areas&#13;
provided by KNEHC; in the case of the twelve substations, a conservative forced outage rate of 10% per&#13;
year has been assumed for the 110-kV/low voltage transformers. The economic cost of outages can be&#13;
very high because they disrupt all types of activities and can damage equipment. A conservative figure&#13;
of 20 UScents/kWh has been used in the economic analysis to value the reduction in outages attributable&#13;
to the project. This might be compared with the cost of owning and operating a stand-by diesel generator&#13;
for use in the event of an outage; assuming 200 hours of outages per year, the cost would be 66&#13;
UScents/kWh. While many consumers would not have stand-by generators, using an economic cost of&#13;
20 UScents/kWh can be considered a low estimate of the benefit.&#13;
I/ Project costs have been estimated assuming a constant nominal exchange rate; since domestic inflation is&#13;
expected to be somewhat higher than international inflation for the next couple of years, the exchange rate would&#13;
appreciate in real terms. Given the small amount of local costs in the project (about 17%) and uncertainty about&#13;
the amount of real appreciation in the exchange rate, the economic analysis has been done in constant 1995 dollars&#13;
without taking the real appreciation into consideration. However, project EIRRs are sensitivity tested with increased&#13;
investment costs and remain acceptable.&#13;

C.    EIRR RESULTS AND SENSITvrrY ANALYSIS&#13;
7.    The economic evaluation has been done for: (a) the Ala Archa substation (nearly 40% of the&#13;
investment cost of the T&amp;D component), (b) the Naryn substation (including completion of the Kemin-&#13;
Naryn transmission line and associated works being financed separately by EBRD), (c) the remaining&#13;
T&amp;D rehabilitation and reinforcement works, and (d) the combined project component. The gross&#13;
benefits in physical units for the Ala Archa substation, the Naryn substation, the remaining T&amp;D works&#13;
and the overall component are in Table 2. The cost and benefit streams and EIRR and NPV calculations&#13;
are in Table 3. The results of the sensitivity and breakeven analyses are in Table 4.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Power and
            District Heating Rehabilitation Project are to support
            economic growth through rehabilitation and upgrading of the
            electricity and heat supply infrastructure and to assist the
            government in restructuring the power and district heating
            sector.  Specific objectives are to: 1) improve the power
            and district heating system efficiency and reliability; 2)
            reduce power and heat losses; 3) reduce the environmental
            impact of the power and heat facilities; 4) rehabilitate the
            existing assets in the power and district heating system; 5)
            introduce appropriate financial management at Kyrgyz
            National Energy Holding Company (KNEHC); 6) restructure
            KNEHC along commercial lines; and 7) attract private sector
            interest in petroleum exploration and production.  The
            project will finance priority investments in the energy
            sector.  Its components include: 1) for KNEHC: (a)
            rehabilitation of the Bishkek combined-heat-and-power plant;
            (b) district heating system rehabilitation; (c)
            rehabilitation and upgrading of power transmission and
            distribution facilities; and (d) technical support and
            training; and 2) for the government: provision of consultant
            services and training for petroleum exploration promotion.
