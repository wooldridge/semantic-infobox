        <abstracts>
            The pace of technological advance in the
            past few decades has opened new possibilities. Consider the
            technology for controlling emissions from cars, buses, and
            trucks. Government regulations have driven this technology
            as much as the technology has driven regulations, resulting
            in vehicle emission standards in industrial countries that
            have become increasingly stringent-far more so than those in
            developing countries. These standards are deemed necessary
            to adequately protect the public, especially from excess
            mortality and morbidity caused by air pollution. But air
            pollution is much more serious in many developing country
            cities. Doesn't this argue for imposing standards just
            as stringent, since the technologies to achieve them are now
            available? Moreover, since the private sector bears the cost
            of adopting these technologies, there should be little
            direct impact on the government budget, removing one of the
            potential obstacles to implementation.
