            Does the owner of a share of stock in
            Mexico have the same rights as one in Germany or India? Is a
            creditor in Italy as well protected as one in Switzerland?
            Do laws protecting investors differ among countries in
            systematic ways? Are they sufficiently enforced everywhere?
            And if there are differences, do they matter for corporate
            finance? This Note reports on a study by the authors that
            examines these issues in a sample of countries covering
            Asia, Africa, Europe, and North and South America. The
            analysis suggests that countries whose legal rules originate
            in the common law tradition tend to protect investors better
            than those whose laws originate in the civil law tradition,
            especially French civil law.
