1. CURRENT SITUATION AND BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   Civil war and unrest have plagued Sierra Leone for more than nine years. Since 1991,&#13;
successive governments have been unable to completely defeat the rebel forces of the&#13;
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and a coup d'etat led by disgruntled junior anny officers in&#13;
May 1997 ousted the government of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah after only 14 months in office.&#13;
Though the President was reinstated to power in February 1998 by the regional military forces of&#13;
the Economic Community of West African States' Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), the security&#13;
situation deteriorated toward the end of the same year culminatg in a well-coordinated attack on&#13;
Freetown by RUF and former Sierra Leonean army forces in January 1999. While the attack on&#13;
Freetown was countered by ECOMOG forces, property damage and loss of life were high&#13;
particularly in the eastem part of the city, the large areas of the northern and eastern provinces of&#13;
the country fell under the control of rebels and former Sierra Leone army forces. In response,&#13;
diplomatic missions and nearly all international agencies pulled out of the country. Subsequent to&#13;
the atack, ECOMOG has slowly regained control over some of the territory that it had lost to the&#13;
rebels and a military stalemate was established.&#13;
1.2   The attack on Freetown was significant for two main reasons. First, it demonstrated that&#13;
the forces of the RUF and the former Sierra Leonean Army (SLA) that had led the military coup&#13;
in 1997 were Lrger in number and better organized and equipped than previously believed.&#13;
Second, the subsequent stalemate reaffirmed that a strictly military solution to the problem would&#13;
be impossible. These two facts hasten the international community and the leadership of the&#13;
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to advocate more forcefully to the&#13;
Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) for a negotiated settlement to the conflict. With the active&#13;
support of the ECOWAS Chairman and the United Nations Special Envoy to the Secretary&#13;
General, the Government entered into political discussions with representatives of the RUF in&#13;
May following a cease-fire agreement. By June a peace agreement had been drafted and the RUF&#13;
political leadership had discussed the main elements of the agreement with their field&#13;
commanders. On July 7, 1999, the President of Sierra Leone, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and the&#13;
political leader of the RUF, Foday Sankoy, signed the peace agreement ending the armed conflict&#13;
that had plagued Sierra Leone for almost a decade.&#13;
1.3   Sierra Leone and its development partners are now in the process of consolidating this&#13;
peace agreement, operationalizing a national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration&#13;
program, extending humanitarian relief activities and renewing national reconstruction efforts.&#13;
The return to Sierra Leone in early October of Foday Sankoy and Johnny Paul Koroma (leader of&#13;
the military junta) to take up responsibilities with the current government and to initiate the&#13;
political process which will allow the RUF and the AFRC to stand for office in the upcoming&#13;
presidential elections is a promising sign that the peace will hold. The international community is&#13;
moving quickly to help the govermnent consolidate its current position and to extend financial&#13;
assistance to face the challenges of the post-conflict recovery programs.&#13;

Background and Summary of the Conflict&#13;
1.4   The root causes of the civil war can be traced to the systematic long-term neglect of the&#13;
rural areas of the country and the exclusion of certain groups from political decision-making&#13;
under previous governments.  Local government was deliberately weakened and lacked&#13;
transparency, the judicial system had lost credibility, infiastructure had decayed and the provision&#13;
of social services had deteriorated consistently over a period of twenty-five years.&#13;
1.5   The immediate causes of the war can be linked to the civil war in neighboring Liberia and&#13;
the subsequent establishment and militarization of the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra&#13;
Leone. The Government of Sierra Leone supported the ECOMOG peacekeeping operation in&#13;
Liberia, which clashed with Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) in 1990.&#13;
In retaliation, the NPFL provided military assistance to a small movement of disaffected Sierra&#13;
Leonean exiles known as the Revolutionary United Front. The civil war in Sierra Leone began&#13;
on 23 March 1991, when the RUF, under the leadership of former Corporal Foday Sankoh,&#13;
initiated a guerrilla war in the east of the country. The stated objective of the RUF was to oust&#13;
the All People's Congress government of President J.S. Momoh. The Sierra Leone armed forces&#13;
were caught by surprise and were ill-equipped to confront the RUF threat. The conflict soon&#13;
spread to the southern and central regions of the country.&#13;
1.6   The war intensified in late 1994, when the RUF significantly expanded the scale and&#13;
scope of its military activities and threatened Freetown. As a result of this escalation of hostilities&#13;
and the associated breakdown of civil authority in large areas of the country, an estimated&#13;
1.5 million civilians from war-affeted areas fled to towns and cities in search of refuge.&#13;
Important mining operations such as Sierra Rutile, the Sieromco bauxite mine and key diamond&#13;
fields, were overtaken by the RUF twice in early 1995. This escalation reduced Sierra Leone's&#13;
official gross foreign exchange earnings by 500/o, disrupted agricultural production and curtailed&#13;
the activities of development agencies and the private sector.&#13;
1.7   From mid-1995 onwards, the RUF suffered a series of military defeats as a result of the&#13;
introduction by GOSL of Executive Outcomes1 and the gradual strengthening of the camajoh&#13;
(civil defense forces (CDF)) movement. With this series of military defeats and following the&#13;
multi-party elections in early 1996, the RUF agreed to a cease-fire and entered into direct&#13;
negotiations with the new Govermment of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in March 1996. After several&#13;
months of negotiations and further kamajoh military pressure, the discussions culminated in the&#13;
signing of the Abidjan Peace Accord on November 30, 1996.&#13;
1.8   The Abidjan Accord, however, was not to be fully implemented. While certain elements&#13;
of the Accord were put in place - such as the establishment of a bi-partisan Commission for the&#13;
Consolidation of Peace - other aspects such as the formulation of a demobilization plan and the&#13;
deployment of peacekeeping forces were not. Escalaing hostilities between the armed forces, the&#13;
kamajors/CDF, and RUF, and deteriorating security in the provinces, were harbingers of the coup&#13;
in May 1997.&#13;
1.9   The AFRC coup was different from previous transitions in power in Sierra Leone in&#13;
several ways. First, not only was the executive branch overthrown, but the legislative process and&#13;
judicial system were also significantly debilitated or, for the most part, destroyed. Second,&#13;
nascent recovery efforts of the 14-month old Government were all but suspended with the closing&#13;

of most international donor and development operations, withdrawal of international staff, and&#13;
suspension of development aid. Finally, the level of random violence against civilian populations&#13;
and both public and private property had significant negative impact on the social fabric of the&#13;
countly and on business and investor confidence.&#13;
1.10 Restoration of the legitimate Government by ECOMOG in February 1998 brought once&#13;
more hope to resolve the conflict. The long process of rebuilding the country could again be&#13;
initiated. Important advances were made subsequently, most notably the design of a&#13;
comprehensive disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program. While the program&#13;
received wide international support and funding commitments, the security situation in the&#13;
country deteriorated. This culminated in the brutal January 1999 attack on Freetown. Most&#13;
international aid efforts to Sierra Leone were subsequently suspended. It is only with the signing&#13;
of the Lom6 Peace Agreement, which incorporates guarantees of free access for humanitarian&#13;
agencies to rebel-held areas, that humanitarian relief -, development - and donor organizations are&#13;
again looking to expand operations outside the relative safety of Westem Area.&#13;
The Lome Peace Agreement&#13;
1.11 The Lome Peace Agreement, was signed on July 7, 1999, by President Tejan Kabbah and&#13;
Foday Sankoh of the RUF, and witnessed by the Chairman of ECOWAS, the UN Special Envoy&#13;
to the Secretary General, and representatives of key regional governments. This Peace Agreement&#13;
established the foundation for a lasting peace, return of security and initiation of reconstruction&#13;
and development for Sierra Leone. Specifically, the Peace Agreement: (i) reiterates the earlier&#13;
signed cease-fire agreement and establishes appropriate bodies to monitor its implementation;&#13;
(ii) facilitates the transformation of the RUF into a political party and allows for the RUF and&#13;
AFRC personnel to hold public office; (iii) enables the RUF to join a Government of National&#13;
Unity through the appointment of Foday Sankoy as chairman of a newly formed Commission for&#13;
the Management of Strategic Resources, National Reconstruction and Development, and&#13;
providing the RUF with four minister and four deputy minister positions; (iv) establishes a&#13;
Commission for the Consolidation of Peace that will oversee the implementation of all structures&#13;
and efforts aimed at the promotion of national reconciliation and the consolidation of peace either&#13;
in existence or provided for under the Peace Agreement; and (v) establishes a Council of Elders&#13;
and Religious Leaders to serve as arbitrators of the Agreement in the event of conflicting&#13;
interpretations by the parties. The full text of the Peace Agreement is presented in Attachment 1&#13;
to this document.&#13;
1.12   While this is not the first agreement of its kind reached between rebel forces and the&#13;
GOSL, it is hoped that the level of international support for the accord (and in particular the&#13;
participation of the regional governments of Liberia2 and Guinea, as well as Nigeria that supplies&#13;
the majority of soldiers to the ECOMOG force) will prove critical in seeing this accord&#13;
implemented. The design and preliminary implementation of a comprehensive disarmament,&#13;
demobilization and reintegration progrm, which was lacking in previous peace efforts, is also&#13;
seen as essential to the long-term success of the accord. In addition, the recent return to Sierra&#13;
Leone of both Foday Sankoh and Johnny Paul Koroma to assume their respective responsibilities&#13;
as defined in the Peace Agreement is a promising sign that the political will of these two parties is&#13;
2 It is noteworthy that President Taylor of Liberia, who it has long been rumored was supporting the RUF&#13;
and AFRC against the GOSL, recently brokered the agreement between Foday Sankoy and Johnny Paul&#13;
Koroma to return to Sierra Leone as called for in the Peace Agreement&#13;

of operationalizing the disarmament and demobilization activities lends further hope that the&#13;
accord will be fully implemented.&#13;
Overall Economic and Social Impact of the War and Post-Coup Conflict&#13;
1.13   Eight years of war and coup-related unrest have devastated the national economy and led&#13;
to large scale social disruption. Substantive damage has been caused to the agriculture and&#13;
mining sectors, thereby greatly reducing rural food security and revenue earning capacity of the&#13;
country. A large percentage of public infrastructure has been destroyed, or has deteriorated due&#13;
to lack of maintenance. The loss of control over resources and diminished government revenues&#13;
drastically reduced foreign exchange receipts and fiscal revenues. The civil war has caused a&#13;
decline in export earnings from mineral resources, a decline in agricultural productivity and&#13;
increased imports of essential food items, such as rice and military equipment.&#13;
1.14  In spite of the civil unrest that plagued the country during the 1990's, the Government&#13;
had implemented a successful series of stabilization and structural reform policies that had&#13;
yielded significant results up until the time of the coup in May, 1997. From 1990/91 to 1996,&#13;
annual inflaion was reduced from over 100 percent to around 6 percent, and the budget deficit&#13;
was reduced from 12 percent of GDP to 6.8 percent in the period from 1989/90 to 1996. These&#13;
gains were achieved while at the same time protecting social sector spending despite budgetary&#13;
pressures related to the war. However, nine months of junta rule in 1997, and predominantly&#13;
unstable economic and political conditions during 1998 and early 1999 have reversed most of&#13;
ese advances. Real GDP was estimated to have contracted by over 20 percent in 1997, and the&#13;
overail budget deficit stood at 11.4 percent of GDP in 1998. It is estimated that real output&#13;
declined by approximately 9 percent during the first half of 1999. Nonetheless, the economic&#13;
siuation during the second half of 1999 is expected to improve with the political stabilization&#13;
resulting from the implementation of the July Peace Agreement. Government revenue is&#13;
projected to increase, and while budget outlays are also expected to increase in relation to&#13;
emergency relief and rehabilitation expenditures, the primary budget deficit for the year as a&#13;
whole is projected to be 7.8 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, given the expected resumption of&#13;
budgetary and other assistance in the last quarter of the year, the reliance on bank financing to&#13;
cover the budget deficit is expected to significantly decline, thereby reducing inflationary&#13;
pressure and stemming the fia in gross external reserves. An IMF mission, in October 1999, will&#13;
establish with Government the indicative reserve targets for end-December 1999, as part of their&#13;
proposed emergency post-conflict assistance policy program for Sierra Leone.&#13;
1.15   The social costs of the conflict have been equally high. Delivery of basic social services&#13;
has been dramatically curtailed in areas outside of the capital. Since 1991, more thn twenty-five&#13;
thousand lives have been lost as a direct result of the conflict. The war and related insecurity&#13;
have also caused the internal displacement of an estimated 1.2 million people (out of a total&#13;
population of 4.7 million), and most of the rural displaced fled to urban environments&#13;
characterized by inadequate housing and poor sanitary conditions. The population of Greater&#13;
Freetown alone increased from 731,000 in 1989 to more than 1.5 million by late 1995, thus&#13;
further straining already overburdened social services. Many of the displaced have been housed&#13;
by extended families, thus also stretching traditional coping mechanisms to their limits. As of&#13;
August 1999, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs&#13;
(UNOCHA) reports that there are still 150,000 registered internally displaced persons (IDPs).&#13;
However OCHA estimates that as many as 1 million people are at risk due to insecurity and the&#13;
inability of humanitarian agencies to access large parts of the northern and eastern regions of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

county. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that more than&#13;
500,000 people have fled Sierra Leone for neighboring countries since 1991, and that at present&#13;
almost the same number remain in neighboring countries.&#13;
1.16   The war and subsequent tunmoil have exacerbated already high levels of poverty in Sierra&#13;
Leone. Prior to 1991 it is estimated that about 80 percent of the population lived on less than one&#13;
dollar per day. Since then, the situation has deteriorated with the widespread destruction of&#13;
public infrasucture, massive population displacements, and the withdrawal of foreign&#13;
investment. The civil war and post-coup period have also been characterized by economic rent-&#13;
seeking. Looting for food, cash crops and other material goods became a means of survival and&#13;
often a source of profitable business for elements within both the RUF and the AFRSL.&#13;
Moreover, control over the illicit diamond mining and trade in the areas bordering Liberia&#13;
became a way for the RUF to finance the procurement of arms and other supplies. These factors&#13;
contributed significantly to the prolongation of the war.&#13;
1.17   The conflict has also contributed to the weakening of traditional authority structures at&#13;
the chiefdom level, and the reduction of trust at the community and family levels, as leaders and&#13;
elders have been killed or displaced, women have been sexually abused and children have been&#13;
abducted. Systematic attacks on authority figures (both human and symbolic- as in desecration of&#13;
secret society "bushes") were a feature of RUF stategy. The remnants of the AFRC junta have&#13;
also tried to undermine the existing authority structures in the towns and villages that they have&#13;
attacked since being ousted by ECOMOG. Nonetheless, these social structures too have shown&#13;
remarkable resilience. Many chiefs were sent out of harm's way by their subjects in order to&#13;
protect their authority; the displaced persons camps have typically been organized in accordance&#13;
with chiefdom structures; and the command, control and recruitmnent mechanisms for the&#13;
kamajoh/CDF movement are closely linked to the chiefdom governance system. Civil society&#13;
reaction to and condemnation of the May coup was rapid, the call for a return of the&#13;
democratically elected government was loud, and, ironically, the nine-month period of AFRC&#13;
rule served to strengthen many local level institutions that were left to fend for themselves in the&#13;
absence of any central-level support or control. Since the return of the Kabbah government, civil&#13;
society representatives have been both active and vocal in calling for a peaceful settlement of the&#13;
9-year conflict.&#13;
1.18   The civil war and the coup are clearly both symptoms and causes of the weakness of the&#13;
Sierra Leonean state. The long-term decline of state services, a governance system characterized&#13;
by corruption, and the politics of regional exclusion were key causes of the civil war. The large&#13;
scale destruction of infrastructure, economic resources and social displacement in the course of&#13;
the conflicts have further weakened the governance capacity of the state. The recovery and&#13;
reintegration process must address the underlying socio-economic causes of the war for Sierra&#13;
Leone to resume a path of peaceful and democratic social and economic development.&#13;
Security&#13;
1.19   Security in Sierra Leone has improved significantly since the low point in January 1999&#13;
when AFRC and RUF forces attacked Freetown. A cease-fire agreement signed in May of this&#13;
year has held, GOSL and RUF representatives took part in detailed technical discussions in Togo&#13;
during May and June, and on July 7, 1999, a Peace Agreement was signed between the GOSL&#13;
and the RUF. Since then, RUF and AFRC leadership (Sankoy and Koroma) have retumed to&#13;
Freetown and are traveling around the country briefing their respective forces on the peace&#13;
agreement, disamament and demobilization; RUF and AFRC representatives have begun&#13;

participating at operational levels in the implementation of the disarmament and demobilization&#13;
efforts; and while some tensions remain, especially in relation to AFRC representation in the&#13;
Peace Agreement, these have been defused through negotiations rather than violence. Access to&#13;
the capitals of the Southern and Eastern provinces has been restored and while rebel troops still&#13;
control large portions of the north and east of the country, they have established procedures and&#13;
mechanisms to allow humanitarian agencies access to these areas and the at-risk populations&#13;
there. The UN has improved the security rating for Western Area and Southem Province to a&#13;
level 3 and the US Embassy has reopened at the end of September, 1999. It is expected that with&#13;
the rapid implementation of the Government's comprehensive disarmament, demobilization and&#13;
reintegration (DDR) program the security situation in the North and East of the country will&#13;
improve rapidly.&#13;
Current Situation&#13;
1.20   Sierra Leone reached a low point in its nine year rebel war, when RUF and AFRC forces&#13;
mounted a well-coordinated attack on Freetown that drove the ECOMOG forces responsible for&#13;
maintaining security in the country out of two-hirds of the city. A week-long battle ensued in the&#13;
central and eastem parts of the city hat resulted in an estimated 5,000 deaths, as yet uncalculated&#13;
destruction of property, and the displacement of more than 50,000 citizens from the eastern end&#13;
and outskirts of the city. ECOMOG forces were eventually able to regain control of the city, the&#13;
Western Area, and some territory lost to the advancing forces in December and January. A&#13;
military stalemate was achieved with the Western and Southern areas of the country controlled by&#13;
ECOMOG and CDF personnel, while large portions of the East and North of the country were&#13;
held by rebels. The result of this siuation was a clearer realization on the part of the Government&#13;
and the international community that had been supporung Tejan Kabbah that a negotiated&#13;
settlement with the rebel forces was the only practical option. This led to detailed technical&#13;
discussions between the GOSL and RUF leadership, which allowed the RUF leadership&#13;
(Foday Sankoh) to meet with RUF field commders. At the same time, a 3-day "National&#13;
Consulation on the Peace Process" exercise was undertaken by civil society representatives&#13;
aimed at strengtening the Government's mandate in the peace negotiations. Ultimately, in this&#13;
context, and with the encouragement and support of the ECOWAS Chairman and the UN Special&#13;
Envoy to the Secretary General, the Government and the RUF signed a Peace Agreement in&#13;
Lom6 on July 7, 1999.&#13;
1.21   The signing of the Peace Agreement has led to almost immediate action on the part of&#13;
Government and its major development partners to begin addressing the humanitarian crises that&#13;
is looming in large areas of the country (most notably the north and east); the need to disarm,&#13;
demobilize and reintegrate a now estimated 45,000 combatants from the forces of the RUF,&#13;
AFRC, AFSL and the CDF; and to restart interrupted efforts at rebuilding the lives and&#13;
communities that have been adversely affected by the past nine years of conflict. The&#13;
Government has helped coordinate the humanitarian efforts of the NGOs, UN agencies and line&#13;
ministries, and has revised and updated the National Disarmament, Demobilization and&#13;
Reintegration Program based on the changing circumstances post-January 1999. A multi-donor&#13;
mission carried out in September 1999 reviewed and reiterated its support of the priorities&#13;
previously identified by Government, including: security, demobilization and reintegration of ex-&#13;
combatants, implementation of the national reconstruction, rehabilitation and resettlement&#13;
program, governance and rule of law, economic management, decentralization and capacity&#13;
building. The International Contact Group (ICG) for Sierra Leone is monitoring the&#13;
implementation of Government's respective recovery efforts and is seeking to assist the&#13;
Govermment to mobilize resources for these priority areas. In terms of security, the Economic&#13;

Community of West African States has agreed to maintain the presence of the 12,000 person-&#13;
strong ECOMOG force to maintain security until a new Sierra Leonean army can be recruited and&#13;
trained, and the United Nations has approved a team of 210 military observers (UNOMSIL) to&#13;
monitor the disariament and demobilization process and to take receipt of surrendered weapons.&#13;
In October 1999, the UN Security Council approved a 6,000 person strong Peace Keeping force&#13;
for Sierra Leone.&#13;
1.22   The President formally established two government institutions with responsibility for&#13;
overseeing the short-term reintegration and rehabilitation efforts of the country: the National&#13;
Committee for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR), and the National&#13;
Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NCRRR). The overall&#13;
managers of each institution (respectively, the Executive Secretary and the Commissioner) have&#13;
been appointed and core technical staffed recruited and hired. The Government has also begun&#13;
implementing concrete efforts to resume its role as coordinator and facilitator of the overall&#13;
recovery and reconstruction efforts of government ministries, NGOs, and community groups.&#13;
The NCRRR structure and staffing requirements have been reviewed and revised in careful&#13;
consultation with donors, a plan of action and three-year budget have been developed and are&#13;
being considered by NCRRR's major partners, and the coordination mechanisms at central and&#13;
regional levels have been reestablished and are funcdoning with a high degree of efficiency.&#13;
1.23  In 1998, the GOSL also developed a comprehensive program framework for the&#13;
disaLmament demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of all ex-combatants (including AFRSL,&#13;
RUF, and CDF personnel). The proposed strategies of the DDR Program were discussed at the&#13;
special UN conference held in July, 1998, that was well-attended and resulted in renewed&#13;
international commitment to Sierra Leone and its programs of national recovery, as well as&#13;
support to ECOMOG. The UK Department for Intemational Development (DFID) provided&#13;
technical and financial assistance to facilitate the implementation of phase I of the program that&#13;
had targeted approximately 7,000 ex-combatants. However, the breakdown in security in late&#13;
1998 that culminated in the January 6, 1999, attack on Freetown interrupted activities under the&#13;
DDR program, as well as humanitarian and nascent reconstruction efforts in much of the country.&#13;
1.24   Subsequently to the January 6t attack on Freetown, the GOSL undertook to review the&#13;
status of the DDR Program jointly with key partners including ECOMOG, UNOMSIL, UNICEF,&#13;
DFID, EU, World Bank and other civil society stakeholders. This review was initiated in the&#13;
context of promising signs that a conducive political environment had developed that would lead&#13;
to a political settlement of the conflict. Following the signing of the Lome Peace Agreement, the&#13;
program has been restarted with the opening of the demobilization camp in Lungi, continuation of&#13;
training activities, and the identification of possible short-term public works employment&#13;
opportunities for the ex-combatants. The DDR program is currently moving ahead quickly with&#13;
the establishment of necessary reception centers and demobilization camps in different areas of&#13;
the country.&#13;
1.25   The level of commitment and ownership on the part of the Government for these&#13;
initiatives, the substantive progress made in initiating key program activities, and the wide-spread&#13;
international donor community support for the Government's efforts encourages hope for the&#13;
success of the overall recovery efforts of Sierra Leone and its partners.&#13;

2. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
Government Strategy&#13;
2.1   In light of a cease-fire brokered with the RUF in early 1996, the Govermnent of Sierra&#13;
Leone carried out an extensive needs assessment of war-affected areas as the basis for&#13;
formulating a national plan for the resetdement, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of the country.&#13;
The plan, referred to as the National Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program&#13;
(NRRRP), was presented to the donor community at a UNDP Roundtable Conference in&#13;
September 1996. At the core of the NRRRP was an initial Quick Action Program (QUAP) that&#13;
focused on 17 different sectors or program areas considered crucial for the social and economic&#13;
recovery and revitalization of the country. The QUAP specifically targeted short-term priority&#13;
areas of post-war reconstruction, focusing on resettlement of displaced persons, demobilization&#13;
and reintegration of ex-combatants, re-establishment of basic social services, and reconstruction&#13;
of economic infrastructure particularly related to agricultural production. The signing of the first&#13;
Peace Agreement between the Government and the RUF in November 1996 gave hope to national&#13;
and international efforts to begin the recovery process in earnest. Commitments made in&#13;
September began to become project agreements between donor countries, the GOSL, and various&#13;
implementing partners on the ground. The Roundtable Conference yielded pledges of&#13;
approximately US$230 million, and formal commitments were estimated at 50% of this total by&#13;
November, 1996.&#13;
2.2    During the same period, the Government elaborated a Poverty Reduction Strategy that&#13;
was anchored on the principle of growth with equity, and developed a Good Governance Strategy&#13;
that dealt with decentralization of admstration, civil service refonn, strengthening of civil&#13;
society, and promotion of transparency and accountability in the public service. These strategy&#13;
documents were presented to a Consultative Group of donors in March, 1997, resulting in pledges&#13;
of more than US$600 million. The coup of May 1997, however, effectively put the NRRRP, the&#13;
QUAP, as well as these other program activities, on hold.&#13;
2.3    While President Tejan Kabbah's Government was in exile, and immediately following&#13;
the reinstatement of democratic rule in March 1998, the Government considered its options and&#13;
the priority actions it would take to ensure rapid recovery of the country upon its return to power.&#13;
Two documents were prepared that highlighted the GOSL's vision for national recovery, namely:&#13;
Restoration to Democratic Civilian Rule in Sierra Leone; a 90 Day Programme (November&#13;
1997), and Post-conflict Recovery Programme; Preparedfor Consultations with Donors - March&#13;
1998. The conclusion of the second document is that the original NRRRP and QUAP priorities&#13;
and funding esinates remain valid and that these program documents should continue to guide&#13;
discussions with the Government's development partners and the donor community in general.&#13;
The original and revised GOSL estimates of costs for the QUAP are shown in Table 2-1.&#13;
2.4   Innmediately upon returning to power, the Government undertook to develop a&#13;
comprehensive program of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants - a&#13;
specific and concerted strategy notably absent from the Government's pre-coup recovery&#13;
program.  The Program, described in the National Disarmament, Demobilization and&#13;
Reintegration Program (NDDRP) document of July 1998 (amended in April 1999), will target&#13;

phases over a three-year period. The program has been developed with the assistance of several&#13;
donors including DFID, UNDP, World Bank, and UNOMSIL, and has benefited from close&#13;
Government consultations with ECOMOG. The Government has shown the highest level of&#13;
political commitment, mobilized broad support from stakeholders and the international&#13;
community, and moved quickly to establish the implementation strategies and structures required&#13;
for the program. The NDDRP, estimated to cost approximately US$33.5 million3, was presented&#13;
to and received the wide support of the international community at a special conference called by&#13;
the UN Secretary General in July, 1998. An initial phase to demobilize 3,000 former anny&#13;
personnel held by ECOMOG was initiated in late 1998 and is now being completed after a six-&#13;
month hiatus resuling from the attack on Freetown. Additional support for the NDDRP is being&#13;
consolidated through the International Consultative Group that was formed as a result of the&#13;
July 1998, UN Conference.&#13;

highlighted in the national recovery program documents. These same priorities were reiterated&#13;
during the most recent multi-donor mission of September 1999 and a number of donors are&#13;
currendy updating their commitments and actively financing elements of the NRRRP and&#13;
NDDRP. In addition, the Government is currently following up on information requested by&#13;
donor agencies and governments during a donors conference held in Washington in&#13;
September, 1999.&#13;
Program Framework and Resource Requirements&#13;
2.6   In view of the diverse and interrelated natre of the problems engendered by the conflict,&#13;
as well as the country's long-term socio-economic decline, GOSL recognizes the need for a&#13;
comprehensive strategic framework for guiding the reconstruction and recovery processes.&#13;
Moreover, since the country is still in transition from war to peace, the program is anchored&#13;
within the context of a continuum from relief to development. Within this framework, the short-&#13;
run emergency relief, resettlement, rehabilitation, and reintegration measures are intended to lay&#13;
the foundation for resumption of normal development activities. To ensure a successful transition&#13;
to the development phase, it is recognized that measures would have to be put in place for the&#13;
demobilization of ex-combatants and their reinsertion into civil society, as well as for an orderly&#13;
rturn and reintegration of the intemally displaced and refugees.&#13;
2.7    With the considerable loss of production capacity in most parts of the country and the&#13;
deterioration and/or destruction of much of the basic physical and socio-economic infrastructure,&#13;
it is essential that quick rehabilitation measures be put in place immediately after the resettlement&#13;
of the displaced people. This will contribute to the restoration of an appropriate socio-economic&#13;
environment necessary for normal development processes over the medium-term.&#13;
Analysis of Commitments to the NRRRP and NDDRP&#13;
2.8   Before assessing the commitments, it is important to recapitulate two important&#13;
expectations about program financing related to the extent of local participation, and the nature of&#13;
-exnal assistance. First, from the outset, it was estimated that the local contribution to the&#13;
progran would be in the order of 10-15%. This would comprise contributions by Government,&#13;
local communities, the private sector and external sources. Government's contribution would be&#13;
in the form of budgetary allocations to cover mainly the local cost of both development and&#13;
recurrent expenditures. The contribution of local communities is expected to be principally in&#13;
kind, through the provision of local materials and labor for community programs and projects.&#13;
Regarding the private sector, the expectation is that it would progressively promote some of the&#13;
planned activities, from transportation of relief goods to reconstruction and developmental&#13;
activities. Second, with respect to international support, it is expected that funding would come&#13;
pardy from re-allocations of already committed funds, the utilization of which had been&#13;
constrained by the escalaton of the war. Government recognizes that redirecting existing loans&#13;
and grants would have to be negotiated in detail with individual donors and international financial&#13;
institutions.&#13;
2.9   The most significant commitments to the post-war recovery programs have been made by&#13;
the following international organizations: UNDP and other UN agencies, World Bank, European&#13;
Union, African Development Bank/Fund, and by the Governments of the UK, US, Germany,&#13;
Japan, Saudi Arabia, and others. The discussion below summarizes commitments made by Sierra&#13;
Leone's major partners in the recovery program.&#13;
&#13;

2.10   The African Development Bank/Fund (AfDBtADF) will provide support to the NRRRP&#13;
thrgh its ongoing investment program as well as by providing new resources. With regard to&#13;
the latter, the AfDB/ADF has committed approximately US$12.24 million for a new emergency&#13;
project that will co-finance, along with IDA, the Government's Emergency Recovery Support&#13;
Fund (ERSF). In addition, USS6.2 million from the ongoing Social Action and Poverty&#13;
Alleviation (SAPA) Program, together with the newly proposed US$17 million Health project,&#13;
will be used to address emergency recovery needs. The Government and ADB have recently&#13;
agreed that the implementation anangements for SAPA, a social fund used to support multi-&#13;
sector activities including micro-enterprise development and rehabilitation efforts in health and&#13;
education, would be streamlined and adapted to the Government's ERSF procedures.&#13;
2.11 The European Commission (EC) has initiated implementation of a US$11.45 million&#13;
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Program, which was suspended soon after start-up m&#13;
February, 1997. The program will be extended to include all 12 rural districts of the country, and&#13;
will also target the urban areas adversely affected during and immediately following the junta&#13;
regime. The EC will continue its emergency agriculture recovery program, provide an additional&#13;
US$2.2 million for seeds and tools to enable farners to resume food production activities, and&#13;
will continue supporting refugee assistance for Sierra Leoneans in Guinea and Liberia. Programs&#13;
are currently being developed in support of child soldiers and civic education. The EC is also&#13;
providing support to the GOSL in the critical area of public financial maagement through&#13;
institutional assistance to the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
2.12   The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has committed USS2.75 million for an Emergency&#13;
Assistance Project which will finance the provision of medicines, food and other supplies for the&#13;
displaced; rehabilitation of peripheral health units and primary schools; and rice seed production.&#13;
A Project Coordination Unit has been established within the National Commission for&#13;
Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NCRRR) to oversee the implementation of the&#13;
project. The IDB has appraised its planned assistance and disbursements have commenced.&#13;
2.13   UNDP has been and will continue to support the Government's recovery efforts in&#13;
several ways. First, US$4.5 million has been committed for the Preventive Development&#13;
Program to be implemented through the NCRRR, and approximately US$200,000 has been&#13;
allocated in support of local non-governmental organizations and governmental coordination&#13;
capacity.&#13;
2.14   The Government of Japan committed US$0.6 million for multi-sectoral activities through&#13;
the UNDP-managed Trust Fund. The entire amount has been disbursed to the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.15   During 1996-97, the United Kingdom provided US$1.6 million for a pilot demobilization&#13;
program channeled through the UNDP Trust Fund. A balance of approximately US$0.6 million&#13;
is currently being used to support the newly established Executive Secretaiat of the DDR&#13;
Program. In addition, DFID has pledged approximately US$10 million in support of the DDR&#13;
Program (of which approximately US$4.5 million has been committed since 1998). DFID is also&#13;
supporting NGO-implemented emergency agriculture rehabilitation activities, and is also&#13;
supporting governance and capacity building for policing and security activities.&#13;
2.16 The International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) has discussed with&#13;
Government the possibility of reprogramming approximately US$1.5 million from the North&#13;
Central Agriculural Project in support of the Government's ERSF to support efforts at&#13;
developing a policy framework for community-based sub-project financing, and to assist in the&#13;
area of long-term community-level food security.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

2.17   The US Government is providing approximately US$34 million for food security,&#13;
agriculture recovery, nutrition rehabilitation, child tracing, and reconciliation activities during&#13;
1999, and a similar amount is expected for fiscal year 2000. While food aid constitutes&#13;
approximately half of this total assistance (US$16.4 million) significant non-food aid is being&#13;
provided by several different offices of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).&#13;
These inputs are channeled through both NGOs and UN agencies.&#13;
2.18   The IDA-financed Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project (CRRP) wiln&#13;
provide US$25 million to support the social and economic reintegration of IDPs, refugees, ex-&#13;
combatants, and the urban unemployed. These funds will be channeled through two principal&#13;
implementation mechanisms; the Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF) that will support&#13;
social and economic recovery of communities, and the Training and Employment Program that&#13;
supports the social and economic reintegration of former combatants. In addition, the Bank-&#13;
financing health sector investment project will be restructured to support emergency health sector&#13;
rehabilitation needs, and the transport sector project is adequately flexible to allow for support to&#13;
recovery related activities as identified and agreed to between the Govermment and the Bank.&#13;
2.19   Table 2-2 below summarizes current actual or proposed support to the Government's&#13;
national recovery programs. Several donor countries, such as Sweden, Holland, Norway, Canada&#13;
and Germany, have indicated their readiness to support the NRRRP and the NDDRP; however,&#13;
the specific nature and level of support has yet to be determined.&#13;

3. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.1   The Government of Sierra Leone has prepared and presented to the international&#13;
community two programs for economic and social renewal in response to eight years of armed&#13;
conflict and more than two decades of misrule, neglect of social infrastructure, and misuse of&#13;
economic assets. These programs are outlined in the National Resettlement, Reconstruction and&#13;
Rehabilitation Program (NRRRP) and the Nahtonal Disarmament, Demobilization and&#13;
Reintegration Program (NDDRP) documents. Both of these program documents have been&#13;
widely distributed to and received support from the international donor community and Sierra&#13;
Leone's development partners, first at the UNDP Roundtable Conference held in Geneva in&#13;
September, 1996, and more recently at the special UN conference sponsored by the Secretary&#13;
General in New York in July 1998.&#13;
3.2   Upon being reinstated to power in March, 1998, President Kabbah formally established&#13;
the two institutions that would oversee the implementation of the two national programs outlined&#13;
in these documents.  These institutions, the National Commission for Reconstruction,&#13;
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NCRRR) and the National Committee on Disarmament,&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR), have limited and time-bound mandates, are staffed&#13;
by local consultants, and will operate outside of standard civil service procedures to help maintain&#13;
their independence and improve their efficiency. NCRRR will coordinate and monitor&#13;
implementation of the NRRRP, while NCDDR will have responsibility for overseeing the&#13;
NDDRP.&#13;
National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation&#13;
3.3   In light of the integrated and multi-sectoral needs of reconstruction and recovery, both&#13;
Government and key donors have recognized the need for a sectorally integrated mechanism to&#13;
oversee the NRRRP. NCRRR has been created to fulfill this role in the same way that the former&#13;
Ministry of National Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation was.  Unlike its&#13;
predecessor, however, NCRRR does not have a civil service administrative branch. Also, in line&#13;
with donor and development partner recommendations, the Commission has rationalized its&#13;
structure to better reflect its coordination and monitoring mandate, and has strengthened the focus&#13;
on decentralized sub-project appraisal. The organiional structre of NCRRR is shown in&#13;
Figure 3-1 on the following page.&#13;
3.4    NCRRR will facilitate dialogue between and coordinate the programs and activities of&#13;
NGOs, line ministries, donor agencies and other implementing partners active in the emergency&#13;
recovery program, and monitor and report on all recovery activities undertaken in the country.&#13;
NCRRR will also oversee the implementation of the Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF),&#13;
a demand driven community-based social fund designed to facilitate the social and economic&#13;
recovery of communities and the restoration of basic social and economic services. The ERSF&#13;
targets internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, and ex-combatants. However, in keeping&#13;
with its inter-sectoral and coordination role, the Commission will not directly implement recovery&#13;
activities financed by the ERSF; this responsibility will rest with its partner organizations,&#13;
including NGOs, line ministries, public authorities and community based organizations.&#13;

The Commission has been established with a finite life span of three years reflecting the short-&#13;
term, emergency, focus of the Government's recovery program. The Commission should cease to&#13;
operate once the immediate needs of resettlement and emergency rehabilitation are addressed,&#13;
leaving the longer-term needs of development to the traditional governmental agencies and NGOs&#13;
active in the various sectors.3.5 NCRRR consists of three technical units, one administrative unit,&#13;
and three project units, namely:&#13;
* Directorate of Programming and Coordination (P&amp;C)&#13;
* Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (PM&amp;E),&#13;
* Information and Sensitization (IS) Unit,&#13;
* Administation, Accounts and Logistics Unit (AAL),&#13;
* Social Action and Poverty Alleviation (SAPA) Project Unit,&#13;
* Islamic Development Bank Project Implementation Unit (EAP) and,&#13;
* UNDP Preventive Development Program Unit.&#13;
3.6 Each Directorate is composed of a Director and one or more Program Managers&#13;
responsible for different functional areas. The IS Unit is headed up by a Program Manager with&#13;
one Project Officer as staff, and the AAL Unit is headed by an Executive Secretary and composed&#13;
of three additional staff The SAPA and EAP Units are headed by Directors who have between&#13;
two and four functional staff, while the UNDP Program Unit is headed by a chief technical&#13;
advisor with one national counter-part. Financial management and procurement of all RRR&#13;
related sub-projects under the IDA Credit will be handled by a separate Financial Management&#13;
and Procrement Unit, which is described below. In addition, four regional offices have been&#13;
established to coordinate and oversee NCRRR operations in the three provincial capitals (Makeni,&#13;
Bo and Kenema), and in Freetown for Western Area. These regional offices (see Figure 3-2) will&#13;
be headed by the Regional Coordinator, staffed with two Projects Officers, a Finance Officer, an&#13;
Information/Sensitization Officer, and will be supported by HACU field officers4. The main&#13;
responsibilities of the regional office will be:&#13;
* information sharing and coordinating activities among NCRRR, line ministries, NGOs and&#13;
regional authorities (government and chiefdom);&#13;
* providing technical and administrative support to the ERSF Projects Committee in&#13;
reviewing project proposals and monitoring project implementation,&#13;
* monitoring the work of implementing organizations (line ministries and NGOs) in carrymg&#13;
out the regional program; and&#13;
* reporting on implementation progress for the national program to the central Commission.&#13;
NCRRR is also discussing the possibility of including a United Nations Volunteer for conflict&#13;
resolution in each of the regional NCRRR offices.&#13;
3.7    District offices will also be established in each of the district headquarters5 and three&#13;
staff, namely a District Supervisor and two Community Development Officers, will be placed in&#13;
each. This staff will have primary responsibility to facilitate the participation of communities in&#13;
the ERSF and to monitor the activities of NCRRR's partner organizations in implementing the&#13;
RRR Program.&#13;
4   One national staff in all three regional offices and one expatriot staff seconded to the UN Office for&#13;
the Coordinator of Humanitran Affairs (UNOCHA) by the Norwegan Refugee Council (proposed&#13;
for Makeni and Kenema).&#13;
Distict offices in the three provincial capitals will be incorporated into the regional RRR offices,&#13;
where space permits, to economize on logistical support requirements.&#13;

3.8    All NCRRR technical staff will be hired under one-year renewable performance-based&#13;
contracts which are independent of civil service salary and benefits regulations. In addition, all&#13;
staff financed by the IDA Credit, UNDP preventive development program, and the AflDB&#13;
emergency project will require the approval of the respective donor agency, helping to ensure&#13;
that the Commission will be staff with well qualified personnel.&#13;

National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration&#13;
3.9   Ihe overall DDR program will be implemented under the guidance and supervision of&#13;
the National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR), a&#13;
temporary institution officially established by Government in July 1998. NCDDR will coordinate&#13;
a program of assistance to all ex-combatants, which will include the demobilization and&#13;
reintegration of AFRC, RUF and CDF personnel, as well as assistance to child and disabled&#13;
combatants. NCDDR will also oversee the implementation of the Training and Employment&#13;
Program (TEP). The NCDDR is chaired by the President and comprises the following members:&#13;
National Security Advisor, ECOMOG Task Force Commander, Deputy Minister of Defense,&#13;
Minister of Internal Affairs and Local Administration, NCRRR Commissioner, Minister of&#13;
Finance, Minister of Information, Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General, a representative of&#13;
the lead donor agency and the Executive Secretary of the NCDDR as its secretary.&#13;
3.10   An Executive Secretariat (ES) to the NCDDR has been established to earry out the day-&#13;
to-day operational issues related to NCDDR's mandate. The Secretariat relies on local and&#13;
international NGOs, Ministry of Education affiliated and independent vocational training&#13;
institutions, and private businesses to provide the services required under the TEP. An Executive&#13;
Secretary heads up the Secretariat and is responsible for reporting to the GOSL and donors on all&#13;
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration support provided under the Credit for ex-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

combatants. The ES will be responsible for ensuring (i) the planning and implementation of the&#13;
individual program components in collaboration with other government departments, NGOs and&#13;
donors; (ii) the transparent and accountable administrai  of the program (including procurement&#13;
and disbursements); and (ini) monitoring and evaluation. The Govermment has already recruited&#13;
technical staff at central level with the support of the PPF and DFID, and the Project will continue&#13;
supporting these staff as well as provide for essential goods and services for the Secretariat in&#13;
close collaboration with DFID. The ES is composed of four units at national level with&#13;
responsibility for: disarmament and demobilization, reinsertion and reintegration, information and&#13;
sensitization, and monitoring and evaluation. A military liaison office has also been established&#13;
to facilitate cooperation with ECOMOG and UNOMSIL on all security-related aspects of the&#13;
program. Financial management and procurement for all DDR activities supported under the&#13;
IDA Credit will be handled by a separate Financial Management and Procurement Unit&#13;
(described below). The organigram of the NCDDR/Executive Secretariat is shown in figure 3-3.&#13;
3.11   Regional Reintegration Offices (RROs) will be established in three regional capitals as&#13;
well as in the Western area. Each RRO will comprise 6 staff, namely a regional reintegration&#13;
coordinator, two ex-combatant counselors, two employment promoters, and an accountant. The&#13;
Govenmnent is currently recruiting RRO staff that would be responsible for:&#13;
* information dissemination and counseling;&#13;
D administration of reintegration assistance;&#13;
D monitoring and evaluation; and&#13;
coordination with NCRRR, other government agencies, administrative authorities, local&#13;
leaders, and other project interventions that target ex-combatants.&#13;
3.12   Each RRO will be assisted by a regional technical committee that will be headed by a&#13;
Regional Reintegration Officer and be comprised of representatives from the local administration&#13;
and/or sector ministry, taditional or religious leaders; NGOs and local businesses. This regional&#13;
reintegration committee will advise the RROs on: (i) community sensitization; (ii) program&#13;
implementation; (iii) conflict resolution related to ex-combatant reintegration; (iv) co-ordination&#13;
with other rehabilitation/reintegration interventions; and (v) security issues.&#13;
3.13 Government recognizes that the activities of NCRRR and NCDDR are not mutually&#13;
exclusive and that the overall success of both programs relies on close and integral coordination&#13;
between the two institutions. Therefore, the programs have established linkages at the national&#13;
policy level and will do the same at the regional implementation level through the various&#13;
committees designed to facilitate coordination (described in detail in the next section.)&#13;
Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU)&#13;
3.14   A Financial Management and Procurement Unit will be established to provide NCRRR&#13;
and NCDDR with technical expertise in all aspects related to financial management and&#13;
procurement. This unit will be set up and managed by an internationally recruited firm with&#13;
project and financial management experience, and will ensure the highest degree of&#13;
accountability and transparency in the implementation of the Project and Program. It is expected&#13;
that the FMPU will oversee funding provided by several donor agencies for the national RRR and&#13;
DDR Programs. The Unit will be headed up by a senior project management expert with&#13;
significant international experience, and be composed of three technical units responsible for&#13;
accounting and disbursements, procurement, and internal control of all relevant program&#13;
resources. The FMPU will work closely with personnel of NCRRR and NCDDR, and with the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, in executing all donor-related financial management responsibilities.&#13;

4. COORDINATION MECHANISMS IN PLACE&#13;
4.1    Overall aid management and coordination in Sierra Leone continues to be weak, although&#13;
the Government is making efforts to limit the entry channels for resources and streamline the&#13;
control system. The Department of Development (under the Ministry of Finance, Development&#13;
and Economic Planning) is charged with the responsibility of coordinating, managing and&#13;
monitoring development assistance, of which the NRRRP and NDDRP will be mrajor components&#13;
in the near term. However, specific responsibility for the coordination of activities related to the&#13;
recovery efforts is the responsibility of NCRRR, while those related to demobilization and&#13;
reintegration will fall to NCDDR. Still, donor agencies and international NGOs continue to deal&#13;
directly with the respective line ministries, or in some cases regional authorities, with which they&#13;
have long-standing relations and a tradition of cooperation. While information on these&#13;
respective funding decisions and activities is, for the most part, transmitted to one or more GOSL&#13;
office, the Government's capacity to collect and consolidate this information, or to monitor the&#13;
work of these partners, is inadequate.&#13;
4.2    Nonetheless, Government's recent efforts to better coordinate the emergency relief and&#13;
initial recovery phase have been more successful due in large part to the assistance provided by&#13;
the Hmanitarian Affairs Coordinating Unit (HACU) of the UN Office for the Coordination of&#13;
Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA). Given the complex nature of the situation, and the frequent&#13;
need to respond quickly to an emerging crises in a multi-sectoral fashion, GOSL has taken a&#13;
number of steps to strengthen coordination. While NCRRR has taken a lead role in this area,&#13;
other organizations are involved in the coordination of the National Programs as well. These&#13;
organizations and their inter-linkages are described below.&#13;
National Level&#13;
4.3   Inter-Msrnteial Committee. This Ministerial-level Program Steering Committee was&#13;
established to facilitate the smooth operations of all aspects of the NRRR Program. This&#13;
Committee is chaired by the Commissioner of NCRRR, and is composed of the Ministers of&#13;
Finance, Development and Economic Planning; Agnculture, Forestry and Environment; Local&#13;
Govermuent, Land and Housing; Education; Health and Sanitation; and Social Welfire, Gender&#13;
and Children's Affairs. The Steering Committee meets regularly to deal with policy issues and to&#13;
address problems and constraints to NRRRP implementation, and will provide guidance to&#13;
NCRRR.&#13;
4.4    National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration. NCDDR is&#13;
the policy making body for the DDR Program chaired by the President and is comprised of the:&#13;
National Security Advisor, ECOMOG Task Force Commander, Deputy Minister of Defense,&#13;
Minister of Internal Affirs and Local Administration, NCRRR Commissioner, Minister of&#13;
Finance, Development and Economic Planning, Minister of Informaution, the Special Envoy of the&#13;
UN Secretary General, a representative of the lead donor agency (the British High&#13;
Commissioner), and the Executive Secretary of the NCDDR as Committee secretary. NCDDR&#13;
formulates national strategies for, and coordinates all governmental activities that support, the&#13;
DDR Program; the Executive Secretariat (ES) will be responsible for carrying out the policy and&#13;
implementing, on a day-to-day basis, the responsibilities of the Government under the DDR&#13;
Program.&#13;
&#13;

4.5    Consultative Forum. This forum was constituted to provide technical advise to the Inter-&#13;
Ministerial Committee on humanitaian relief and emergency recovery activities. The forum is&#13;
comprised of representatives from donor agencies, Government line ministries, and non-&#13;
governmental organizations, and gathers information from the specialized technical sub-&#13;
committees in the areas of agriculture, food aid, water and sanitation, health and nutrition,&#13;
education, shelter and roads, child protection, and sensitization and information. This forum&#13;
replaces both the inter-sectoral technical committee (composed of representatives of GOSL line&#13;
ministnes) and the national inter-agency forum that operated and advised MNRRR pnor to the&#13;
coup. The Forum is chaired by NCRRR.&#13;
4.6   Spedic Sectoral Commitees. A number of specific technical or sectoral committees are&#13;
currently operational and are responding to the needs of information sharing and coordination&#13;
among funding agencies, implementing partners and government institutions. Among these are&#13;
the national Committee on Food Aid, a Water and Sanitation Committee, an Agricultural Sub-&#13;
committee, and the Emergency Health Task Force. These committees discuss and establish&#13;
policy guidelines and operational procedures for their respective sectors and inform larger inter-&#13;
sectoral bodies (such as the Consultative Forum) of their deliberations. The Project makes the&#13;
best use of these bodies and mechanisms to help ensure appropriate levels of coordination of&#13;
donor funding and implementing partner activities.&#13;
4.7    Commission for the Consolidaion of Peace. This body has been established under the&#13;
Lm6 Peace Agreement to ensure the overall implementation of the post-conflict programs&#13;
envisioned by Government. The Commission will have as members two representatives of civil&#13;
society, and one representative each named by the Government, the RUF and the Parliament.&#13;
While the CCP's terms of reference have not yet to be specified, it is assumed that this body will&#13;
monitor the activities of the other institutions responsible for the implementation of the recovery&#13;
efforts, such as NCRRR and NCDDR.&#13;
Regional Level&#13;
4.8   Inter-Agency Fora. In response to the emergency relief activities carried out from 1995&#13;
to 1997, inter-agency forums (IAF) were formed in each provincial capital to serve as&#13;
mechanisms for information exchange and coordination between GOSL line ministries, NGOs,&#13;
relevant UN agencies, bilateral donors and community-based organizations. Participation in the&#13;
WF is open to all development partners and representatives of beneficiary groups and is chaired&#13;
by NCRRR. As with the Consultative Forum at national level, specialized sectoral committees,&#13;
such as those dealing with food aid, health and nutrition, or child protection, advise the IAF on&#13;
specific technical issues. The I4Fs also serve as the first point of review for subprojects&#13;
proposed for financing under the CRRP. Subsequent to the junta, the IAF in Freetown has been&#13;
superseded by the Consultative Forum.&#13;
4.9   Specd&amp;ic Technical Committees. Numerous sector-specific committees and ad hoc&#13;
technical working groups exist at both regional and national level that address issues of technical&#13;
norms, procedures and coordination among agencies working in the same sector. Examples of&#13;
such committees include the Committee on Food Aid, the Water and Sanitation Committee, the&#13;
Demobilization Advisory Group, and the Agriculture Committee. These committees have either&#13;
formal or informal links to the regional and national inter-agency committees (i.e., LAF and the&#13;
Consultative Forum) and will serve the CRRP in terms of technical review and input to ERSF&#13;
sub-project review.&#13;

4.10   Distid Coorinaton Commiees (DCC). Under the NRRRP, DCCs will be formed by&#13;
NCRRR distict level staff with the assistance of the local authorities and line ministries, to assist&#13;
in the process of assessing local priorities and identifying finding gaps for recovery activities.&#13;
The composition of the DCC will include the NCRRR District Supervisor, and representatives of&#13;
local NGOs, line ministries, local government and chiefdom authorities.&#13;
Donor Coordination&#13;
4.11   The UNDP Resident Representative has traditionally assumed responsibility for donor&#13;
coordination in Sierra Leone, a country with few bilateral donors and where the dnve for&#13;
economic management reforms has been supported by the World Bank/IMF adjustment programs&#13;
through the Ministry of Finance. The UNDP Resident Representative is also the UN&#13;
Humanitarian Coordinator, which improves the linkage between emergency relief and longer&#13;
term rehabilitation assistance. HACUtUN-OCHA assists in coordinating the relief efforts of&#13;
NGOs and donors in Sierra Leone and also plays a critical role in providing technical assistance&#13;
to NCRRR.&#13;
4.12   The Government and the Bank have developed and maintained close and constructive&#13;
working relationships with key development partners and stakeholders in the preparation of the&#13;
proposed CRRP. Cooperation has been particularly close with DFID and the British High&#13;
Commission; the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary General and UNOMSIL; the&#13;
African Development Bank; the UN fimily, especially OCHA, WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR and&#13;
UNDP; the European Union; USAID; and several national and international NGOs. The Bank&#13;
has conducted joint missions or overlapped with several key donors including UNDP, DFID,&#13;
GTZ, AfDB, UNHCR, IFAD, and USAID's Office of Transitional Initiatives (USAID/OTI), and&#13;
has achieved a high degree of consensus on program strategies and respective institutional&#13;
support. This effective coordination among the Govermnent's key partners bodes well for&#13;
program implementation.&#13;

5.1   The GOSL clearly recognizes that demobilization and the subsequent social and&#13;
economic reintegration of ex-combatants, IDPs, and refugees are crucial for achieving lasting&#13;
peace, stability and economic growth. The Government has explicitly outlined its strategies for&#13;
addressing these priorities in two program documents previously noted (i.e., the National&#13;
Resettlement, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Program (NRRRP) and the National&#13;
Disarmament, Demobilizanon and Reintegration Program (NDDRP)). The first progran is&#13;
based on an extensive needs assessment of war-affected areas carried out by the GOSL in mid-&#13;
1996, which was submitted to the international community at a UNDP Round Table Conference&#13;
in September 1996 in Geneva. Subsequent to the restoration of democratic rule in March 1998,&#13;
the GOSL reiterated the priorities outlined in this first document and the donor community&#13;
indicated their agreement with these priorities in the Joint Governent/Donor Communiqu6&#13;
issued in May, 1998. The second document, prepared after the return of the Kabbah Government,&#13;
was presented to the international community at a special meeting called by the UN Secretary&#13;
General in July 1998.&#13;
5.2    Both documents have been well received by donor agencies and development partners&#13;
active in Sierra Leone, and these organizations have moved quickly to support the program&#13;
strtegies outlined therein. Specifically: the United States, the European Union, UN agencies and&#13;
non-governmental organizations are assisting with emergency relief food security, and&#13;
emergency health services; DFID, UNOMSIL, and the Office of the Special Envoy on the UN&#13;
Secretary General are helping to support the demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants;&#13;
and UNDP, the African Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank are helping to&#13;
strengthen the institutional capacity of the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement&#13;
and Rehabilitation.&#13;
5.3  The commitment of the GOSL and the international community to the recovery process&#13;
presents a unique "window of opportunity" to revitalize Sierra Leone's economic and social&#13;
development. This opportunity also brings with it raised expectations as well as conerns over&#13;
the Government's ability to nmnage the enormous post-war reconstruction effort facing the&#13;
country and to quickly succeed in: (i) consolidating peace and undertaking to disarm and&#13;
demobilize approximately 45,000 combatants; (ii) resettling 150,000 IDPs and repatriating nearly&#13;
500,000 Sierra Leonean refugees from Guinea and Liberia; (iii) rehabilitating key elements of the&#13;
country's rural infrastructure; (iv) providing material, financial and other inputs to Sierra Leonean&#13;
farmers to encourage resettlement and the resumption of agricultural production; and (v) restoring&#13;
basic social services, particularly primary health care and basic education.&#13;
5.4 This challenging post-conflict context provides the backdrop for the Bank's intervention.&#13;
Current confidence in, and high expectations of, the Government may be replaced with frustration&#13;
and skepticism if order and security are not reestablished, displaced populations are not&#13;
reintegrated, and social and economic infiastucture is not rebuilt. Consequently, timely and&#13;
adequate donor assistance is critical for longer-term economic development as well as social&#13;
stability.&#13;

Strategy for Proposed Bank Assistance&#13;
5.5  IDA is a leading player in Sierra Leone, with projects in two sectors of central concern to&#13;
the national recovery efforts- -inauct  and health- and a Project Preparation Facility (PPF)&#13;
for an institutional support Project in education. Furthermore, IDA is proposing to support&#13;
macro-economic reform in Sierra Leone through an Economic Recovery Credit As such, IDA is&#13;
well-positioned to support the Government's multi-sectoral reintegration and reconstruction&#13;
efforts. Its involvement is further justified by the amount of resources required for the recovery&#13;
programs, the poverty focus of the Project, the need to monitor the macro-economic impact of the&#13;
process, and the shortened time frame within which an Emergency Recovery Credit can respond.&#13;
5.6 During the immediate post conflict period of two to three years, rapid progress on&#13;
reintegration of ex-combatants, economic recovery and reconstruction, in the context of economic&#13;
stability wili be essential to the long-term economic development of Sierra Leone. Therefore,&#13;
post-conflict transition will be the central theme of IDA's assistance activities over the next few&#13;
years. To this end, the proposed CRRP would serve as IDA's primary instrument to support&#13;
rehabilitation, reconstruction and reintegration efforts in Sierra Leone, while the Economic&#13;
Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit will address short-term balance of payment and budgetary&#13;
support through a credit of USS 30.0 million. At the same time, the Integrated Health Sector&#13;
Investment Project (Cr. 2827SL) is being restructured, and the Transport Sector Project&#13;
(Cr. 2895-SL) is flexible enough to be adapted, to take account of the changing situation and&#13;
emergency resource requirements of the country.&#13;
5.7 The Government has adopted a phased strategy to the implementation of the national&#13;
recovery programs that has been instructed by post-conflict situations in Afiica and throughout&#13;
the world. The phases, and the acual and/or proposed financial support of each one, is&#13;
summarized in Table 5.1 below. In the short-term, the proposed CRRP will be central to this&#13;
phased strategy.&#13;

5.8  The first, transition phase, of the Government's strategy incorporates and implements&#13;
simultaneously the two major components of the DDR and RRR Programs, and the proposed&#13;
Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project intends to support these two components.&#13;
The first part of this phase will the improve the security situation through the structured&#13;
disarmament and demobilization of approximately 45,000 ex-combatants, including members of&#13;
the Armed Forces of Sierra Leone (AFSL), RUF and the Civil Defense Forces (CDF). The&#13;
second part will address the short-term needs for social and economic reintegration and&#13;
rehabilitation of ex-combatants and the vulnerable civilian population. The second development&#13;
phase of the Government strategy would affect a progression from short- and medium-term&#13;
reconstruction and recovery programs to longer-term development and poverty reduction through&#13;
more traditional investment projects.&#13;
Project Rationak&#13;
5.9   Security, social stability and future economic growth in Sierra Leone will depend, inter&#13;
alia, on the successful demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, the return of IDPs and&#13;
refugees to their communities, and the revitalization of social and economic infrastructure.&#13;
Therefore, the Project, designed to provide the needed immediate support for the reintegration of&#13;
these groups and to strengthen the social and economic infiastructure in the communities most&#13;
affected by the war, will play an important role in the process of continued recovery. It is felt&#13;
that the social and economic reintegration of the target group lends itself well to IDA support&#13;
because of the Bank's overall poverty focus in its lending program in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.&#13;
5.10   Furthermore, one of the underlying causes of the civil war and conflict over the past&#13;
eight years has been the long-standing neglect of rural areas by the Central Government, resulting&#13;
in a long-term decline of social services and infrastructure and growing disenchantment among&#13;
large parts of the population. The Project will assist the process of redressing the urban bias in&#13;
national development through a decenralized sub-project identification and implementation&#13;
stregy, that should, if successful, rebuild confidence in GOSL's commitment and capacity to&#13;
respond to the needs of the society as a whole.&#13;
5.11 The underlying Project concept of providing assistance to the internally displaced,&#13;
refugees and ex-combatants, as well as to the receiving communities, is based on best practices&#13;
and experiences gained in similar IDA member countries and post-conflict situations, and is&#13;
deemed appropriate for achieving the development objective of the Project. The targeted public&#13;
works program for the urban unemployed, and the training and employment efforts directed at ex-&#13;
combatants are also based on successful Bank and other donor agency experiences in numerous&#13;
countries. The Project design is based on a collaborative review and assessment of key socio-&#13;
economic and other factors that have and will influence the emergency situation and recovery&#13;
process. The review was carried out by the World Bank, Government, and major stakeholders in&#13;
as thorough a fashion as possible given the changing security situation in-country during the last&#13;
three years. A list of all documents and reports from the project preparation phase contained in&#13;
the Project file is shown in Attachment 1 to this Technical Annex.&#13;

6. MODIFICATION OF ONGOING OPERATIONS/&#13;
REASSESSMENT OF THE LENDING PROGRAM&#13;
6.1   In addition to the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project, the World Bank&#13;
will directly respond to the Government's National Programs through the reorientation and&#13;
modification of the existing portfolio of projects discussed below.&#13;
Integrated Health Sector Investment Project (IHSIP)&#13;
6.2   IDA has been a key partner in the Govermnent's recent efforts to develop and implement&#13;
a comprehensive health sector reform program, and has assisted the Government in promoting the&#13;
sector-wide investment approach among donors. IDA approved the Integrated Health Sector&#13;
Investment Project (CR. 2827-SL) in the amount of US$20.0 million equivalent in March 1996,&#13;
which supports the Government's core program for the health sector. The goal of the&#13;
Government's program (and the Project) is to improve the health status of the people of Sierra&#13;
Leone by increasing access to and improving the quality of a basic package of health services.&#13;
The principal program and Project strategies are to improve the management of the health care&#13;
delivery system and promote the decentralization of service administration and provision.&#13;
6.3    As the country moves out of the emergency phase it has found itself in over the past two&#13;
years, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) intends to address priority health sector&#13;
needs as defined in its Annual Transitional Plan (2000). During the current fiscal year IDA will&#13;
consider financing any of the priority activities identified under the Plan for which no other&#13;
source of funding is available. Preliminary MOHS assessments indicate that support will be&#13;
required for the main tertiary care facilities (Connaught, Kissy and Childrens Hospitals), and&#13;
possibly for the Central Medical Stores depending on other donor commitments. IDA has also&#13;
indicated interest in supporting MOHS' efforts to strengthen its STD/HIV/AIDS, family&#13;
planning, malaria, nutrition, and maintenance programs and systems, and would also support&#13;
capacity building activities in the areas of procurement and financial management for the&#13;
Ministry.&#13;
6.4    Due to implementation delays resulting from the 1997 coup d'etat and security&#13;
constraints during 1998 and 1999, approximately US$ 15.6 million of the Credit remains&#13;
available under the IHSIP as of August 1999. In light of these delays and the changing health&#13;
sector priorities in-country, the Government will request an extension of the Project closing date,&#13;
and proposes a formal restructuring of the Project to better address the emerging priorities,&#13;
particularly in relation to civil works activities. The mid-term review scheduled for late 1998, is&#13;
now planned for January/February 2000, and wili be used to guide the restructuring process.&#13;
Transport Sector Project (TSP)&#13;
6.5    A Credit in the amount of US$35.0 million was made available to the GOSL for the&#13;
Transport Sector Project (Cr. 2895-SL) in 1996 to support capacity building of the Government&#13;
institutions responsible for the sector; the restructuring and privatization of relevant parastatals;&#13;
and investments in road maintenance, traffic management, ports, airports and waterways.&#13;

Specifically, the TSP aims to (i) build up the Coordination and Monitoring Unit of the Ministry of&#13;
Transport, Communications and Environment; (ii) establish a new autonomous Road Transport&#13;
Authority; (iii) develop small and medium sized labor-based enterprises for road works;&#13;
(iv) improve the organzatonal structure of the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA);&#13;
(v) restructure Ports Authority; (vi) privatize the Road Transport Corporation, National Airlines&#13;
and the National Shipping Company; (vi) invest in a program of road maintenance for trunk&#13;
roads, feeder roads and city streets; (vii) undertake traffic management measures for Freetown;&#13;
(viii) repair and rehabilitate Freetown's port, slipway, quay and container stacking area;&#13;
(ix) repair the airport runway and edge lighting and procure safety equipment and perimeter&#13;
fencing; and (x) rehabilitate and provide coastal and riverway landings and storage facilities.&#13;
6.6   The status of the TSP was reviewed in Conalry in June 1999, and agreement reached&#13;
between IDA and the government in September 1999, on an interim one-year strategy that will&#13;
contribute to peace and reconciliation within the parameters of the Project agreement. It was also&#13;
agreed in September that there was no need to restructure the project in order to respond to the&#13;
emergency needs of the country. The focus of activities during the interim period will be to:&#13;
(i) enhance existing institutional capacities focusing on productivity, (ii) provide for labor-&#13;
intensive employment opportunities through small enterprises, (iii) rebuild feeder roads,&#13;
(iv) improve major road links to facilitate access to domestic and international markets,&#13;
(v) rehabilitate Freetown port capacity, and (vi) preserve investments and enhance air traffic&#13;
safiety at Lungi airport. As of July 12, 1999, almost US$30.0 million remained undisbursed under&#13;
the project.&#13;
Urban Water Supply Project (UWSP)&#13;
6.7   The Urban Water Supply Project (CR. 2702-SL) was designed to support a major&#13;
rehabilitation of the water supply system, the rehabilitation of a small existing sewage system,&#13;
and the establishment of a low-cost sanitation program for Greater Freetown, and to improve the&#13;
public and private sector capacities for operating and maintaining these systems. Specifically, the&#13;
Project will strengthen the Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC) and rehabilitate and expand&#13;
its infrastructure to provide water to Freetown, to carry out studies, and to improve water supply&#13;
operations in other major towns; to identify a role for the private sector in water provision; to&#13;
provide technical assistance for sanitation; to rehabilitate and extend, on a pilot basis, the&#13;
Ministry of Works, Energy and Power's (MWEP) existing sewage system, and to provide&#13;
supervision and institutional support to MWEP. The main implementing agencies are the&#13;
GVWC, the MWEP and the Sierra Leone Roads Authority which will manage the low cost&#13;
sanitation component of the Project.&#13;
6.8   The major beneficiaries of the Project are the population and businesses of Freetown&#13;
currently with limited or no access to safe water. The sanitation component would also assist the&#13;
planning and implementation of low-cost sanitation measures in the priority areas of Freetown,&#13;
again targeting directly the population in these areas. The Project became effective in August&#13;
1995, and is expected to close in December 1999. As of July 12, 1999, approximately&#13;
US$15 million (of the total Credit of US$35.0 million equivalent) had been disbursed.&#13;

Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP)&#13;
6.9   In August 1993, IDA approved a Credit of US$45.0 million equivalent to the GOSL for&#13;
the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (CR. 2451-SL). The main objectives of the&#13;
Project are: (i) to remove physical bottlenecks in the country's transport network; (ii) to build the&#13;
institutional capacity of SLRA and the Department of Works of the MTCE; (iii) to strengthen the&#13;
transport sector institutions to improve sector management, planning and to foster market-&#13;
oriented policies; (iv) to encourage new methods of infastructure rehabilitation and maintenance;&#13;
(v) increase the share of private sector participation in road maintenance and develop capacity of&#13;
small-sized contractors to maintain the road network; and (vi) to promote the use of non-&#13;
motorized transport to increase rural mobility and improve transport services available for the&#13;
rural poor.&#13;
6.10   As of July 1999, this Project had disbursed all but approximately 10% of the credit and is&#13;
now scheduled to close on June 30, 2000. The remaining balance of funds will be used to&#13;
complete the road repair and naintenance works in the Greater Freetown area that were begun&#13;
prior to the breakdown in security in late 1998.&#13;
Proposed Fourth Education Project&#13;
6.11   A Fourth Education Project (FY'01), which is under preparation, will seek to assist the&#13;
GOSL to rehabilitate the education sector in the medium term. Its objectives will include:&#13;
(i) defining and implementing a policy framework conducive to cost-effective financing of the&#13;
education system and to increasing access by and retention of students; (ii) strengthening the&#13;
managerial and pedagogical capacity of the sector in order to progressively improve resource&#13;
mobilization, allocative efficiency, administration and quality; and (iii) providing support to the&#13;
restoration of service delivery at the district level.&#13;
6.12   Project preparation was interrupted by the coup d'6tat and subsequent social unrest and&#13;
insecurity that, in tur, has led to a further deterioration of the education sector's capacity to&#13;
deliver services. In response, the Government and IDA will re-evaluate their strategy for the&#13;
education sector and explore new approaches to support the education sector in a post-conflict&#13;
situation, including the possibility for a Learning and Innovation Credit (LIL), focusing, in&#13;
particular, on transition related issues such as strengthening education sector management at&#13;
central and decentralized levels, increased cooperation with private providers and stakeholders,&#13;
and pre- and in-service teacher training (including the need for special counseling of traumatized&#13;
youth). If feasible, a LIL could support an innovative approach and provide opportunities for&#13;
intensive monitoring and learning. The experience gained could then inform the proposed larger-&#13;
scale Education IV Project.&#13;
6.13   IDA will further assist the efforts to restore the education system and reduce illiteracy&#13;
through the CRRP, which will include support to rehabilitate community level infiastructure,&#13;
including schools, and re-establishing provision of basic education services.&#13;

Youth in Crises Project&#13;
6.14   Ihis project, which is financed under the Development Grant Facility in the amount of&#13;
USS250,000, became effective in September, 1998 and is being implemented by the NGO&#13;
ActionAid, in cooperation with UNICEF, Conciliation Resources and the Ministry of Education.&#13;
Disenfranchised Sierra Leonean youth have filled the ranks of the RUF, greatly contributed to&#13;
destruction following the coup in 1997, and have long been seen by Government and its&#13;
development partners as a potential impediment to peace and stability. The purpose of the grant&#13;
is to support a participatory consultative process and pilot reconstruction activities with youth that&#13;
will support specifically define at-risk groups through a range of education, training,&#13;
employment, health and recreation schemes. As the project was defined in the context of the&#13;
emergency situation and directly addresses one of the identified target groups of the CRRP, it will&#13;
support the CRRP by identifying potential support strategies for youth.&#13;

7. THE MACRO-ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK&#13;
Background and Introduction&#13;
7.1    By the late 1980's, Sierra Leone faced widespread poverty following nearly two decades&#13;
of economic mismanagement. To address this problem, the government initiated an economic&#13;
recovery program in late-1989 which sought to correct large macroeconomic imbalances and&#13;
undertake structural reforms. In order to reestablish normal relations with external donors and&#13;
creditors, the government adopted a rights accmulation program (RAP) with the International&#13;
Monetary Fund in 1992. A Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC) was extended by the World Bank&#13;
in 1992, followed by a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) in 1993 as well as various sectoral&#13;
credits. Stabilization gais were achieved and the groundwork was laid for major structural&#13;
reforms, which brought renewed support from bilateral and multilateral donors. Upon completion&#13;
of the RAP, Sierra Leone adopted a three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)&#13;
arrangement in March 1994.&#13;
7.2   Following large stabilization gains, the economy once again experienced a positive rate&#13;
of growth in 1994 (Table 7.1). However, in early 1995, fighting between government and RUF&#13;
forces escalated. The RUF overran the rutide and bauxite mines in January 1995, which at the&#13;
time accounted for nearly 70 percent of Sierra Leone's official exports and 17 percent of&#13;
government revenue. The spread of RUF attacks outside the eastern and southern provinces led&#13;
to a fiuther large displacement of the population, loss in agricultural output, and disruption to&#13;
major transport links. The heightening of the conflict was also a setback to macroeconomic&#13;
stability. Inflation on a year-to-year basis jumped from 22 percent in 1994 to 35 percent in 1995.&#13;
Likewise, the Leone depreciated by more than 50 percent. The loss of mining output and&#13;
displacement of persons from firming activities led to a decline in real GDP by an estimated&#13;
10 percent.&#13;

7.3   The Government's position strengthened somewhat in 1996 when it resorted to the use of&#13;
the services of external military contractors to combat the rebels. The security situation improved&#13;
correspondingly, and the economy began to show signs of recovery. Following multiparty&#13;
elections in February and March 1996, prospects for economic recovery were bolstered by the&#13;
new Government's commitment to macroeconomic stability and structural reform. As a result,&#13;
real GDP is estimated to have grown by 5 percent in 1996 on the strength of a rebound in&#13;
agricultural output and alluvial diamond mining activity. Inflation fell to 6 percent and the&#13;
exchange rate remained stable. However, the key rutile and bauxite mining operations did not&#13;
reopen as hoped for in 1996. As a result, the current account deficit (excluding grants) increased&#13;
from 17.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to 21 percent in 1996. Nevertheless, the Bank of Sierra Leone&#13;
was able to achieve a modest increase in gross international reserves to the equivalent of&#13;
1.5 months of imports, largely as a result of donor inflows.&#13;
7.4   The process of reconstruction was brought to an abrupt halt by the coup d'6tat staged by a&#13;
handful of junior military officers in May 1997. There was a complete breakdown in the security&#13;
situation, leading to increased lawlessness, destruction of property, and massive displacement of&#13;
the population. Economic activity came to a virtual standstill with most businesses remaining&#13;
closed after being looted. As a result, unemployment, already high before the coup, soared&#13;
fiuther. Real GDP is estimated to have contracted by over 20 percent in 1997. Government&#13;
finances deteriorated during the course of 1997 against the backdrop of a virtual cessation in&#13;
mining revenues, a sharp reduction in customs revenues due to a trade embargo, and mounting&#13;
expenditures on generally non-productive activities. The budget deficit on a commnitment basis&#13;
increased to 7.4 percent of GDP compared to 6.3 percent of GDP in 1996. In the absence of&#13;
external financing and a lack of domestic market for government debt instruments, public&#13;
expenditures were funded largely by central bank financing. Inflation, which was about 6 percent&#13;
on an annual basis at the time of the coup, surged to about 100 percent during the junta rule.&#13;
Severe foreign exchange shortage as a result of cessation in mining activity and in donor-financed&#13;
project and program aid led to a nearly 100 percent depreciation of the exchange rate, to over&#13;
Le. 1,600 to the US Dollar.&#13;
7.5   The resolution of the crisis provided the opportnity for the restoration of normal&#13;
economic activity.  The Government resumed the implementation of its Resettlement,&#13;
Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction (RRR) Program that received donor support at the&#13;
Consultative Group meeting in March 1997 and that was reaffirmed with the return of the&#13;
Government in March 1998. Furthermore, the Government re-launched the consultative process&#13;
with a wide spectrum of civil society to elicit their input into a national development strategy for&#13;
poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth. The main themes that emerged out of this&#13;
Strategic Planning and Action Process (SPP) were: (i) creating a unified, peaceful nation with&#13;
good governance; (ii) creating a strong, stable, and growing economy; and (iii) creating a nation&#13;
of healthy, capable, and productive citizens.&#13;
7.6    After the return of Government in March 1998, economic activity resumed, with real&#13;
GDP estimated to have increased by an estimated 1 percent for the year as a whole, after a sharp&#13;
decline in 1997. Inflation dropped from 48.7 percent in the first quarter of 1998 to a negative 5.7&#13;
percent in the fourth quarter7. Although Government continued to experience serious institutional&#13;
capacity constraints with regards to budgetary management, revenue collection rose significantly&#13;
7 The macroeconomic information on 1998 and 1999 is largely derived from the IMF Briefing Paper -&#13;
Request for Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance, October 1999.&#13;

to an estimated 7.5 percent of GDP, from 5.6 percent of GDP in 1997. However, total&#13;
expenditures and net lending rose by an estimated 5.5 percent to about 19 percent of GDP.&#13;
The overall 1998 budget deficit increased to 11.4 percent of GDP. Financing of the deficit&#13;
occurred largely by recourse to domestic borrowing, with net credit to Government rising to an&#13;
estimated 26 percent of broad money, which increased by 11 percent. By the end of December&#13;
1998, gross external reserves had risen to US$44.1 million and the parallel market premium had&#13;
fallen by half to about 13 percent.&#13;
7.7   The civil unrest in January 1999 reversed the very modest gains that occurred during&#13;
1998. To date (October 1999), it is estimated that real output has fallen by 9 percent since the&#13;
beginning of the year. Revenue performance was poor and expenditures and net lending&#13;
increased by 90 percent during the first half of 1999 (relative to the outturn for the first part of&#13;
1998). The rise in expenditures reflected the impact of a 40 percent wage and salary increase for&#13;
Government workers, a rise in external debt service payments and an increase in security outlays.&#13;
Financing of the deficit continued to rely heavily on the banking system. The parallel market&#13;
exchange rate depreciated by about 35 percent between December 1998 and June 1999, while the&#13;
parallel market premium widened to 38 percent.&#13;
7.8    After the signing of the Lome Peace Accord, the economic situation is expected to&#13;
improve. For the second half of 1999, Government revenue collection is projected to improve&#13;
markedly. Expenditures, however, are expected to increase even faster due to outlays on&#13;
emergency relief and rehabilitation. The primary budget deficit and the current account deficit&#13;
are projected to rise to 7.8 and 12.7 percent respectively. Budgetary assistance from international&#13;
donor organizations has increased significantly since July 1999 and amounts to about&#13;
US$50 milliong.&#13;
Macroeconomic Management&#13;
7.9   The Sierra Leonean authorities recopize that the restoration of macroeconomic stability,&#13;
especially in the light of huge outlays required in the context of the RRR program, is critical for&#13;
building business confidence and eliciting a strong private sector supply response. In view of&#13;
this, they are currently elaborating a macroeconomic program with the IMF to ensure that the&#13;
macroeconomic imbalances are reduced and that the emergency donor funding would be used&#13;
efficiently. The main focus of the Govermnent policies during 2000 will be to elaborate and&#13;
initiate macroeconomic and strucural reforms.  The overarching objectives of the new&#13;
macroeconomic framework will be to significantly reduce the rate of inflation while permitting a&#13;
recovery in economic activity and a reconstitution of gross external reserves. These&#13;
macroeconomic objectives will be pursued through prudent fiscal, monetary, as well as external&#13;
trade policies in conformity with a market-determined exchange rate. The macroeconomic policy&#13;
framework is likely to be developed along the following policy guidelines:&#13;
The World Bank fumded Emergency Recovery and Rehabilitation Credit is scheduled to go the Board&#13;
before the end-December 1999, and entails US$30 million of balance of payments support.&#13;

Fiscal Polies&#13;
7.10   The main objectives of the fiscal program in the medium term are to reduce significantly&#13;
the overall budget deficit, improve the quality of expenditure, and pursue the social objectives of&#13;
the RRR program. The Government recognizes that a reduction in the fiscal deficit is essential to&#13;
maintaining price stability and steps are taken to strengthen fiscal discipline. An increased&#13;
revenue effort will be undertaken and tight control over spending will be maintained. Previously&#13;
initiated measures to strengthen expenditure control and monitoring will be reinforced.&#13;
Improvement in revenue mobilization, will come from: (i) an improvement in tax administration,&#13;
which will be pursued through the establishment of an independent revenue authority that would&#13;
be remunerated on the basis of performance; stricter enforcement in the customs and excise&#13;
department; greater monitoring of freight levy; and better collection of revenues from fisheries;&#13;
and (ii) changes in the tax structure to improve compliance: this will be approached through&#13;
introduction of new income tax legislation that will be geared to a more equitable distribution of&#13;
the tax burden and would lower tax rates. Further, the Government is considering measures to&#13;
broaden the tax base (with technical assistance from the IMF). Specific fiscal targets are expected&#13;
to be set in collaboration with the IMF mission.&#13;
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies&#13;
7.11   The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) will pursue a monetary policy aimed at substantially&#13;
reducing the rate of monetary expansion and lowering inflation in line with the above mentioned&#13;
macroeconomic targets. Credit expansion to the private sector is being encouraged. The policy&#13;
priority in the financial sector is to ensure that commercial bank portfolios are restructured to&#13;
restore profitability and to conform with prudential guidelines. The reform will aim at creating a&#13;
more stable and viable financial system by improving banking supervision and oversight by BSL,&#13;
expanding available savings instruments, and promoting growth and competition in the provision&#13;
of financial services. Specifically, the revised Banking and Bank of Sierra Leone Acts, which are&#13;
expected to be introduced in Parliament, should allow for improved banking supervision,&#13;
strengthened prudential requirements, increased minimum capital requirements, and appropriate&#13;
guidelines for classifying loans and issuing new tradable instruments.&#13;
Edernal Sector Polices&#13;
7.12 The Government intends to contain the current account deficit within limits that can be&#13;
financed through budgetary and balance of payments assistance, and consistent with the&#13;
naintenance of a modest level of gross external reserves. The current account deficit is expected&#13;
to rise to 16 percent of GDP, while gross reserves are targeted to amount to US$35 million at the&#13;
end-December 2000. GOSL will negotiate with extemal creditors to reach agreement on the&#13;
outstanding extenal debt service arrears. The current market determined exchange rate will be&#13;
mainained and measures will be put in place to narrow the gap between the official and the&#13;
parallel market rate.&#13;
7.13 On trade policy, the Government will continue to maintain a liberalized trade system,&#13;
diversify exports, and promote efficient import substitution activities. The range of duty rates&#13;
will be narrowed, with the lowest rate of 5 percent, applied to raw materials, spare parts, plant&#13;
and machinery, and essential capital goods, the rate of 20 percent applied to intermediate and&#13;
semi-manufactured goods, and the highest rate of 40 percent applied to luxury goods. The tariff&#13;
regime will be reviewed to bring it more in line with the unfolding tariff reductions in&#13;
neighboring countries. A duty drawback system for non-traditional exports is likely to be&#13;
&#13;

introduced and is expected to have a positive impact with the recovery of exports after the war.&#13;
The transparency of Sierra Leone's external trade regime, especially with regard to discretionary&#13;
exemptions is expected to be improved following greater scrutiny and stricter monitoring of non-&#13;
governmental organizations that are exempt from paying duties. In parallel with the reforms on&#13;
the macroeconomic front, the Government is planning to undertake wide-ranging reforms towards&#13;
structual change and flexibility in the economy. The Government realizes that much still&#13;
remains to be done and it is updating its reform agenda accordingly in the areas of public&#13;
enterprise sector restructuring, central administabve reform, private sector development, and&#13;
public expenditure management.&#13;

8. PROJECT PREPARATION FACILITY&#13;
8.1   Following a cease fire between the GOSL and the RUF in April 1996, the Government&#13;
formally applied for a PPF Advance, (in the amount of US$400,000) to initiate activities&#13;
necessary to prepare the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project to be financed by&#13;
IDA. In particular, the advance from the PPF was used to:&#13;
* finalize participatory needs assessments and related beneficiary profiling studies;&#13;
* complete the detailed design of proposed project components, including; (a) the ERSF&#13;
systems and procedures, (b) assessment and initial work needed for the Integrated&#13;
Information Center, and (c) the development of a standard package of essential&#13;
productive inputs; and&#13;
* perform preparatory work to assess and consolidate the existing implementation&#13;
capacity of the Ministry of National Reconstruction, ResetUement and Rehabilitation,&#13;
including: (a) prepare an implementation manual, and (b) recruit a limited number of&#13;
staff with the necessary technical expertise on a contraual basis to allow the&#13;
MNRRR to fuilfl its coordination, monitoring and management function at the&#13;
Regional level.&#13;
8.2    Up until the time of the coup d'etat of 1997, the PPF was managed by MNRRR with&#13;
assistance from the IDA-financed Public Sector Management Support Project (CR. 2435-SL).&#13;
Supplementary PPF Advance&#13;
8.3   By May 1997, the initial PPF advance of US$400,000 had been fully disbursed, mainly&#13;
for consultancy services and the procurement of equipment. In response to the signing of the&#13;
Peace Agreement in November 1996, and a marked improvement in the security situation, a&#13;
supplemental PPF advance of US$1.6 million was requested by the GOSL and approved by IDA&#13;
immediately prior to the coup d'etat. At that time, it was proposed that this PPF be used to:&#13;
*  help finalize changes in overall project design that put greater emphasis upon the&#13;
regional administration and implementation structures; which require resources for&#13;
initial operational costs and equipment at regional level, and additional training and&#13;
sensitization of MNRRR staff and implementing partners; and&#13;
*  initiate pilot activities under the Emergency Recovery Support Fund to identify and&#13;
address potential technical and administrative problems which could negatively affect&#13;
implementation, and to prepare a "pipeline" of sub-projects to allow rapid start-up of&#13;
activities immediately after loan effectiveness.&#13;
8.4    Disbursements for all Bank Projects and PPFs were suspended in June 1997 as a result of&#13;
the coup; this suspension was only lifted in July 1998. Despite the 11 month interruption, the&#13;
purpose of the supplementary PPF advance remained valid and the Government proceeded with&#13;
the preparation activities as planned prior to May 1997. Preparatory activities were notably&#13;
curtailed following the attack on Freetown in January 1999, however as of October 1999,&#13;
approximately US$1.5 million of the total PPF advance of US$2 million, had been expensed or&#13;

9. COMMUNITY REINTEGRATION AND&#13;
REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Description&#13;
9.1   The Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project (CRRP), which seeks&#13;
US$25 million equivalent IDA financing, will support the GOSL's emergency recovery programs&#13;
(the NRRRP and the NDDRP) by assisting those people and communities most affected by the&#13;
past eight years of conflict to rebuild their communities and resume normal productive lives.&#13;
The Project will consist of two components: (i) an Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF),&#13;
and related institutional support to the NCRRR and partners; and (ii) a Training &amp; Employment&#13;
Program (TIEP), and related institutional support to NCDDR and partners.&#13;
ERSF and Related Intiutional Suppoit&#13;
9.2   The ERSF will facilitate the social and economic recovery of communities and the&#13;
restoration of basic social and economic services through demand-driven, community-oriented&#13;
projects that target internally displaced persons, refugees and the communities affected by the&#13;
conflict of the past eight years. The ERSF will finance sub-projects in the areas of agricultural&#13;
rehabilitation, temporary shelter, reconstruction of community infrastructure, establishment of&#13;
essential social services, promotion of reconciliation, and local institutional capacity building that&#13;
target IDPs, refugees and the communities to which they return. The ERSF wiln also support&#13;
labor-intensive urban and rural public works programs that help rehabilitate economic and social&#13;
assets, and which provide a temporary social safety net for specifically targeted vulnerable groups&#13;
of unemployed youth, ex-combatants, and others. Sub-projects would range in cost from&#13;
US$ 10,000 to US$500,000 equivalent, and would be implemented by eligible partners, including&#13;
internaonal and national NGOs, line ministry units, existing project units, and community-based&#13;
organizations which have adequate capacity.&#13;
9.3    As part of the ERSF sub-projects, IDA would finance the cost of equipment and vehicles,&#13;
basic agricultural inputs, construction materials, traiing, technical assistance, and essential&#13;
operating costs associated with sub-project implementation. In addition, IDA would finance a&#13;
portion of the recurrent costs associated with sub-project administration, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation on the part of the Government. Detailed and satisfactory systems, procedures,&#13;
standardized guidelines and formats have been developed by GOSL and are presented in the&#13;
'"ERSF Operational Manual". The African Development Bank will co-finance with IDA the&#13;
ERSF, institutional support of NCRRR, and related project management costs under this&#13;
component of the CRRP. GOSL is discussing the possibility of additional support to the Fund&#13;
with other donor agencies.&#13;
TEP andRelated Ins_ituional Support&#13;
9.4   The TEP will support the social and economic reintegration of former combatants&#13;
through targeted counseling, training, and employment initiatives. The social reintegration efforts&#13;
would include civic education, socio-psychological counseling and community sensitization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

activities. Counseling and referrals would prepare ex-combatants for their return to civilian life&#13;
and assist them by providing critical psycho-social support during the reintegration phase and by&#13;
providing information and opportunities to access available reintegration assistance.&#13;
The economic reintegration services would include a vocational orientation, counseling on job-&#13;
seeking strategies, information and advice on training and employment opportunities and on&#13;
establishing micro-projects. The TEP program would also offer concrete means for linking ex-&#13;
combatants to trauning and employment opportunities, including the referral to labor-intensive&#13;
public works, broader rehabilitation projects, income generating activities, vocational training and&#13;
apprenticeships.&#13;
9.5   In the area of vocational training the program would encourage existing training suppliers&#13;
to prepare and implement short, modular training courses that correspond to the educational&#13;
background and career interests of the ex-combatants (based on a socio-economic profile&#13;
compiled at the time of registration), and the needs of the labor market. Skills development will&#13;
be provided through a contract training scheme with training providers. Rehabilitation of&#13;
vocational training infiastructure would also be required during the pilot phase of the program.&#13;
Once training capacity has been re-established, the introduction of voucher programs may be&#13;
encouraged to ensure that the training is sufficiently demand-driven and to enable ex-combatants&#13;
to purchase the training that will increase their employability. The TEP will also finance training&#13;
expenses incurred by artisans who train ex-combatants through informal sector apprenticeships;&#13;
tool-kits would be provided upon commencement of the apprenticeship or after completion of the&#13;
vocational training to increase the employability of ex-combatants.&#13;
9.6   ERSF and TEP activities will be implemented by eligible partners including international&#13;
and national NGOs, government line ministry units, existing project units and community-based&#13;
organizations where capacity warrants. The sub-project implementation procedures have been&#13;
designed through a process of investigation, consultation, and consensus-building initiated by the&#13;
Govemment, the World Bank and others in mid-1996. Over a six-month period Government&#13;
staff regional authorities, national and international NGOs, and key international agencies and&#13;
donors currently involved in the rehabilitation and recovery process were consulted on how best&#13;
such a funding mechanism should work. This collaborative process aulminated in a set of&#13;
consultative meetings of Ministry staff, NGO representatives and key donors held in November&#13;
1996 and May 1997 to finalize these procedures. The result of this consultative process is the&#13;
shared understanding of the rationale behind the proposed administrative procedures and a shared&#13;
responsibility among the group involved in the process for the successful implementation of the&#13;
fund. It is believed that this participatory planning process will help ensure the viability of the&#13;
Project.&#13;
9.7   The ERSF will rely on a decentralized, bottom-up project planning, approval and&#13;
monitoring process which taps into and builds upon existing systems and structures at the&#13;
regional and local levels. Implementing partners will be called upon to design sub-projects in&#13;
close collaboration with village, section and chiefdom authorities. Regional inter-agency&#13;
committees and regional NCRRR and NCDDR staff will oversee individual project selection and&#13;
monitoring activities. NCRRR and NCDDR headquarters' staff will provide the broad policy and&#13;
program planning fiamework for the CRRP, monitor national CRRP implementation and&#13;
coordinate overall recovery efforts. A national level Projects Committee will be constituted to&#13;
review and approve sub-projects that are valued at US$50,000, or more, are national in scope, or&#13;
that target the Western Area. The TEP will utilize a standard requests for proposal system as well&#13;
as a demand-driven project identification process similar to the ERSF to select and finance&#13;
reintegration sub-projects for ex-combatants. Regional Reintegration Offices will evaluate&#13;
&#13;

TEP are summarized in Section 12 of this Technical Annex, and are described in detail in the&#13;
respective operational manuals, which are contained in the Project file.&#13;
Project Costs and Financing&#13;
9.9   The total esfimated costs for the CRRP is US$54.34 million, of which IDA will finance&#13;
US$25.0 million equivalent. The African Development Bank/Fund will co-finance the first&#13;
component of the Project related to the ERSF and support to the NCRRR  DFID, while not a&#13;
formal co-financier of the CRRP, has committed approximately US$13 muilion equivalent in&#13;
support of the Project's second component, the TEP and related institutional support to NCDDR&#13;
Counterpart contributions from GOSL, implementing agencies and communities that will receive&#13;
support under the ERSF and TEP are estimated at US$4.1 million equivalent. The two tables&#13;

Areas of CRRP Activity&#13;
9.10 In line with the overall objectives of the NRRRP and the NDDRP, the CRRP will support&#13;
interventions and sub-projects which address the following broad sectors and areas of activity:&#13;
*     Agricultural  Rehabilitation:  including   support  to   basic   productive   activities&#13;
(primarily through the provision of seeds, tools and emergency food supply for the&#13;
farming season); support to rehabilitation of tree crops, other cash crops, fishing&#13;
(through the provision of equipment) and animal husbandry (through re-stocking of&#13;
animals);&#13;
*     Shelter: principally  to  provide temporary  structures and  to  provide the  planning&#13;
framework for permanent facilities;&#13;
* Rehabilitation of Community Infrastructure: to support the rehabilitation of schools,&#13;
health  centers, court barmes  (traditional vi1lage  admnitatve  structure), water&#13;
supply, roads, nrual market-places and other priority structures as identified by&#13;
communities;&#13;
*   Re-establishment of Essential Services: to provide human and material resources&#13;
essential to the re-establishment of basic health and education services in&#13;
collaboration with the relevant ministries;&#13;
*   Reintegration  of Vulnerable  Groups: supporting  the  social and  economic&#13;
reintegration of specific groups (e.g., widows, female head of households, ex-&#13;
combatants, children affected by the war and disabled people) into communities;&#13;
which may include temporary safety nets, community sensitization, vocational&#13;
training capital/credit, counselingftrauma healing, information, employment&#13;
(e.g. labor-intensive public works), education and/or functional literacy;&#13;
*   Promotion of Reconciliation: for programs promoting reconciliation and conflict&#13;
resolution at the community level; which may include developing conflict resolution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

skills, promoting reconciliation through local media, supporting youth, community&#13;
and voluntary associations with the potential for promoting reconciliation;&#13;
*  Small Enterprise Promotion and Vocational Training Schemes: designed to support&#13;
development of productive skills among individual target group members&#13;
(particularly ex-combatants) and to promote income generating activities at&#13;
community level;&#13;
* Public works program targeting unemployed groups in the poorest sections of&#13;
Freetown, provincial capitals and for rural reconstruction in areas such as:&#13;
environmental sanitation and waste disposal, road repair and maintenance, public&#13;
buildings maintenance, urban reforestation, etc.; and&#13;
* Capacity-Building: of local organizations in all of the above areas the development.&#13;
Geographic and Beneficiary Targeting&#13;
9.11   The CRRP will be active throughout the regions and districts of Sierra Leone which have&#13;
been affected by the war. Priority will be given to supporting populations returning to rural areas,&#13;
and for those areas most severely affected by the war.&#13;
9.12   The CRRP will coordinate closely with other recovery activities (e.g. the European&#13;
Comnmission's Resettlement and Rehabilitation Program, line-ministry emergency plans, NGO&#13;
initiatives, etc.) so as to avoid duplication and overlap in areas of operation. The procedures for&#13;
sub-projec review and approval will also support similar sub-project activities financed by the&#13;
ADB-supported Social Action and Poverty Alleviation (SAPA) Program, which is also managed&#13;
by NCRRR.&#13;
9.13   To be eligible for consideration, any sub-project proposal presented to the CRRP must&#13;
target one of the following groups: (i) people in war-affected villages who never moved but are&#13;
takin initiatives to re-establish themselves and their communities; (ii) people returning&#13;
sotaneously to their villages from displaced camps, bush camps and other areas; (iii) vulnerable&#13;
groups, such as female headed households, children affected by the conflict through being&#13;
orphaned, war trana or disrupted schooling, and disabled people, including those severely&#13;
injured or trumatzed by the war; (iv) ex-combatants and their dependents; and (v) urban&#13;
unemployed.&#13;
Institutional Support to NCRRR and NCDDR&#13;
9.14   The National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation is charged&#13;
with coordinating and monitoring the NRRRP. While NCRRR is a temporary institution, it is&#13;
also newly established and requires support to effectively carry out its mandate, particularly in&#13;
relation to the CRRP. Therefore, the proposed Project would strengthen NCRRR's efforts to&#13;
coordinate, monitor and facilitate implementation of priority recovery activities through the&#13;
provision of essential goods, equipment and support of recurrent costs for central and regional&#13;
offices. In addition, the Credit would finance technical assistance in the areas of financial&#13;
management, procurement, auditing, management information systems, ERSF implementation&#13;
assistance, and project evaluation. IDA will share the cost of supporting NCRRR with the AfDB,&#13;
UNDP and the Government.&#13;
9.15   The National Committee on Disannament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR)&#13;
is also a newly established governmental institution with a- temporary mandate of three years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration andRehabilitation&#13;
Country: Sierra Leone                                                Page 44 of 87&#13;
The Executive Secretariat (ES) of the NCDDR is the implementing arm of the National&#13;
Committee, and it will require core operational support to be able to fully carry out its mandate.&#13;
The Bank, at the request of the Government, has provided advice and techimcal assistance to help&#13;
develop the NDDRP, and to operationalize the ES. It is proposed that the Project continue to&#13;
support technical assistance for the Program in the areas of social and economic reintegration,&#13;
community sensitization, management information systems, and financial management. It was&#13;
agreed with Government that this last area of assistance would be shared with NCRRR (in the&#13;
form of the FMPU). The Credit would also finance essential core investment and recurrent costs&#13;
of the central and regional offices of the NCDDR IDA would provide this support in close&#13;
collaboration with DFUD and other potential donors such as the German government.&#13;
Existing Instutional Support&#13;
9.16   Several donor agencies have provided essential institutional support to both NCRRR and&#13;
NCDDR. Prior to the coup, the UNDP had entered into a 2-year capacity building program with&#13;
MNRRR to ensure the effective delivery of demobilization, reintegration, rehabilitation and&#13;
recovery activities. UNDP is now supporting NCRRR through its Preventive Development&#13;
Program. The UK's Overseas Development Agency provided essential material and personnel&#13;
support specifically for demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants prior to the coup, and&#13;
DFID is curntly the main donor supporting DDR activities. The Islamic Development Bank&#13;
established a Project Implementation Unit in MNRRR prior to the coup, and the ADB is also&#13;
assisting NCRRR through the SAPA Program, which has been reoriented to more closely support&#13;
the national recovery efforts. The UN Humanitrn Affairs Coordination Unit assisted the&#13;
former Ministry, and UN-OCHA now works closely with NCRRR, to help the Government to&#13;
fill its information collection, monitoring and coordination role.&#13;
9.17 Notwithstanding the assistance of these donor organizations, NCRRR and NCDDR still&#13;
require funding for core staff positions, critical equipment, and basic logistical support to fully&#13;
carry out their institutional mandates and to effectively implement the Community Reintegration&#13;
and Rehabilitation Project. Therefore, IDA proposes supporting those functions and units which&#13;
are seen as essential to the successful Project implementation. The specific nature of this support&#13;
is described below; detailed cost tables for the Project are shown in Attachment 3 to this&#13;
document.&#13;
Project Supportfor the Central Level&#13;
9.18   As noted above, NCRRR and NCDDR have received important institutional support from&#13;
several donors to set up the central level systems and hire personnel to coordinate and monitor&#13;
national program activities. However, basic operating support for central and field-level&#13;
activities, supplies, technical assistance, and essential staff training and development are absent&#13;
from most of these efforts. Given the ambitious program of activities being planned by both&#13;
government and NGOs, and the positive responses of donor countries and organizations to&#13;
supporting the two programs, the challenges which NCRRR and NCDDR face are significant and&#13;
are growing rapidly. It is clear to all donor agencies involved with NCRRR and NCDDR that&#13;
firther support is required for the institutions to adequately fulfill their mandates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

9.19 Tberefore, to ensure the effective operation under the CRRP, IDA will provide&#13;
incremental support to the three central-level technical (non-project specific) units of NCRRR9.&#13;
This support will cover essential operating costs associated with planning, managing, monitoring&#13;
and coordinating the ERSF (including local consultant fees, per diem and travel costs, fuel, minor&#13;
equipment, and basic supplies). The Project will fund necessary technical assistance to develop a&#13;
computerized monitoring and evaluation system and to assess the impact of selected sub-projects,&#13;
and inputs needed to produce and disseminate sensitization messages via modem and traditional&#13;
media outlets. Finally, the credit will be used to finance the Project's financial audits and for the&#13;
technical advisor to the ERSF. Similarly, the Project will also finance necessary equipment,&#13;
personnel, operating costs and technical assistance to the Executive Secretariat to the NCDDR to&#13;
ensure the effective coordination of the NDDRP.&#13;
Projet Supportfor tke Regional Levels&#13;
9.20 In the process of preparing the project, the Government and its development partners&#13;
emphasized the need to decentralize decision making, build local level capacity and encourage&#13;
community participation in the overall recovery process. Furthermore, all stakeholders involved&#13;
n the preparation and appraisal of the CRRP specifically expressed strong support for the&#13;
decentralization of the Project's management functions in helping redress the Freetown bias of&#13;
previous Government led development efforts.&#13;
9.21   The Project as a whole will have a strong regional focus and a large portion of the&#13;
technical and administrative decisions for the Project will be taken at this level. Therefore, it is&#13;
essential to the success of the CRRP that adequate systems, procedures, staff and logistical&#13;
support are available at regional level to undertake these responsibilities. Unfortnately, NCRRR&#13;
and NCDDR's initial focus on establishing the central directorates has cost the regional offices&#13;
their share of support and the limited staff and logistical support currently in place in the regions&#13;
is funded entirely from the PPF for the Project. Therefore, in order to ensure the efficient&#13;
operation of the CRRP, and the overall effectiveness of NCRRR and NCDDR at regional level,&#13;
IDA will support the regional offices of both institutions in terms of essential staff, necessary&#13;
equipment and vehicles for monitoring field activities, and operating costs associated with travel,&#13;
fuel, basic supplies and office rents.&#13;
9.22   The Project will also provide support to local non-governmental implementing partners in&#13;
the areas of project proposal development, financial management, and project implementation to&#13;
strengthen local institutional capacity to more fully participate in the CRRP and the national&#13;
recovery program in general. IDA will share these cost of strengthening NCRRR, NCDDR and&#13;
local implementing partners with UNDP, AfDB and DFID.&#13;

10. STUDIES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
Preparatory Studies Completed&#13;
10.1 The studies and consultancies described below have been undertaken by and on behalf of&#13;
Govemment in order to facilitate the preparation of the CRR.&#13;
Social and Economic Reintegration andResource Management: A Study on Conflict&#13;
andReconciiaion.&#13;
10.2  This qualitative study examined three main issues: (i) potential conflict over land and&#13;
land based resources in the context of large scale civilian resettlement; (ii) community&#13;
perceptions of the demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants; and (iii) operational&#13;
strategies to revitalize and support the capacities of community structures to deal with conflict&#13;
resolution. The analysis indicated that the displaced felt that there would be very little conflict&#13;
over land allocation, with the possible exception of areas with tree crops where resettlement&#13;
needs would have to be coordinated closely by local authorities.&#13;
10.3  Regarding the demobilization and reintegration of ex-ombatants, interviews undertaken&#13;
revealed that while some recognize the need for reconciliation others were fearfil about having&#13;
ex-combatants in their communities. These fears could be allayed if a proper community&#13;
sensitization process is implemented to inform people about the scope and coverage of the&#13;
demobilization and reintegration process. The study further examines operational strategies to re-&#13;
establish and support the capacities of community structures to deal with conflict resolution. A&#13;
significant reform of the judicial system was recommended, as well as a sensitization process, at&#13;
the local judiciary level and among paramount chiefs.&#13;
Reintegration of War-Affected Youth and Ex-Combatants: A Study of the Social and&#13;
Economic Opportunity Structure in Sierra Leone.&#13;
10.4  This study, undertaken in October 1996, assessed the motivation and needs of war-&#13;
affected youth and ex-combatants and analyzed social and economic opportunity structures&#13;
currently existing in Sierra Leone. The study highlights that:&#13;
i. most young people have become entrapped by the fighting rather than volunteering&#13;
for action;&#13;
ii. the total numbers of irregular combatants are not that large, and therefore&#13;
demobilization could be relatively straightforward; and&#13;
iii. hard core RUF combatants, particularly those with a track record for violent&#13;
atrocities, fear that they will become targets for civilian revenge. However, many&#13;
combatants spoke of a desire to be reunited with their families and to retum to&#13;
school or complete disrupted education.&#13;

Socio-Economic Survey of theArmed Forces of the Republic of Sierra Leone&#13;
10.5   A socio-economic survey of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Sierra Leone (AFRSL)&#13;
was undertaken between December 1996 and January 1997 to gather statistically useful data on&#13;
the needs, characteristics and aspirations of nilitary personnel with a view to informing the&#13;
design of Government reintegration measures. Quantitative data was supplemented by qualitative&#13;
information gathered in focus group discussions, which sought further information on needs and&#13;
the civilian aspirations of AFRSL personnel. The main findings of the survey were that:&#13;
i.  AFRSL personnel are predominately male (98.1%), under thirty years of age&#13;
(56.2%), and married (96%);&#13;
ii. the majority of the forces (61.8%) have only served for up to 5 years;&#13;
iii. education rates are relatively high by Sierra Leone standards (only 29.2% had never&#13;
been to school, and 30% had completed secondary education);&#13;
iv. if discharged, over 75% of members of the AFRSL would return to their home&#13;
communities, where they expected that family members would be the main source of&#13;
initial assistance; and&#13;
v. the lack of employment opportunities was cited by 54.9% of those interviewed as&#13;
being the major concem upon demobilization.  Respondents also identified&#13;
professional training as a vital need after demobilization. Some respondents&#13;
expressed a wish for agricultural tuining.&#13;
10.6 GOSL will augment these findings with the data currently being collected as part of the&#13;
DDR registration process underway at Lungi Camp, as the Government designs appropriate&#13;
reintegration strategies.&#13;
Consultancies Undertaken to Prepare the Project&#13;
10.7   A number of other consultancies were also undertaken in preparing the Project, which are&#13;
described below.&#13;
Design of the ERSF&#13;
10.8  Three separate missions were carried out by the US NGO, Planning Assistance, to help&#13;
the Government to define the implementation procedures for the ERSF and prepare the Project's&#13;
Operational Manual. The missions relied on in-depth consultations with potential implementing&#13;
partners at the central and regional levels and a review of World Bank and other donor best&#13;
practices in setting up and operating similar social-fund type projects. The final design of the&#13;
ERSF was the result of thorough negotiations between Government, NGOs and key stakeholders&#13;
to arrive at a decentralized implementation mechanism which relied on existing regional inter-&#13;
agency coordination structures. The final phase of the work involved the conduct of regional&#13;
workshops with potential implementing partners to initiate sub-project proposal development, and&#13;
assistance to the ERSF regional structures to begin the process of sub-project review, evaluation&#13;
and approval. As part of the August 1998, post-appraisal mission, assistance was also provided to&#13;
help the Government review and update the operational systems and procedures, and to&#13;
accommodate the ERSF co-financing arrangement with the AfDB.&#13;

Integrated Information Center (IIC)&#13;
10.9  The feasibility of an infonnation sharing mechanism that would strengthen the ability of&#13;
GOSL to coordinate and monitor the vanous demobilization, reintegration, resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation activities, was appraised during an identification mission in September 1996 by two&#13;
US NGOs, Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA) and Response Net. The Integrated&#13;
Information Center was conceived of to facilitate the flow of information between UN Agencies,&#13;
NGOs and GOSL ministries, and would provide several different services to its users, including:&#13;
(i) private e-mail accounts; (ii) a conferencing feature; and (iii) a medium for sharing reports and&#13;
maps. The IIC system uses a sophisticated communication software (Mustang Wildcat 5) which&#13;
runs on a single PC, serving as a host. Users connect via modems, but the capacity exists in the&#13;
software to expand to include wireless communication and to allow for network access. The UC&#13;
can be utilized by all personnel and organizations involved in humanitarian, reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation work in Sierra Leone. Access for line ministries is also planned. UNDP is currently&#13;
assisting NCRRR to reactivate the Center which is currently out of service, but which remained&#13;
physically intact throughout the coup and its aftermath.&#13;
Technical Assistancefor the DDR Program&#13;
10.10 Within the context of the DDR reintegration program, technical assistance is being&#13;
provided to assist the Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR in the planning and design of the&#13;
reintegration activities for the ex-combatants. IDA has supported the Secretariat through PPF and&#13;
PHRD grant resources with a team of international experts in the areas of social reintegration,&#13;
economic reintegration and community sensitization. As of July 1999, this support is being&#13;
financed by DFID through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund established and managed by the World&#13;
Bank. The social reintegration specialist will assist DDR in the planning and design of programs&#13;
for (i) civic education; (ii) socio-psychological counseling; and (iii) pre-discharge orientation.&#13;
The economic integration specialist will assist DDR in the planning and design of training and&#13;
employment activities. The community sensitization specialist will assist DDR in the planning&#13;
and design of an information and sensitization campaign targeting former combatants, intended&#13;
communities of retum, and a nationwide audience. Finally, an assessment of potential labor-&#13;
intensive public works activities was carried out in order to identify specific activities and&#13;
implementing partners that could facilitate the reintegration of ex-combatants.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluaion&#13;
10.11 A robust Management and Evaluation System will be required to track and analyze&#13;
periodic data on Project inputs, outputs and outcomes, and to evaluate the impact of Project&#13;
strtegies on the overall development objectives of the National DDR and RRR Programs. While&#13;
both NCRRR and NCDDR have established the structures and are in the process of hiring the&#13;
personnel which will have responsibility for collecting and maintaining the relevant information,&#13;
the appropriate M&amp;E systems are not yet designed. NCDDR has received preliminary assistance&#13;
in the design of an M&amp;E system, and will receive further support from both international experts&#13;
and local systems designers in carrying out, entering and analyzing the first set of data from the&#13;
Phase l(a) demobilization exercise. NCRRR will receive similar technical assistance under the&#13;
PPF, or through a bilateral agreement with DFID. It is expected that on-going technical support&#13;
will also be required for both institutions during Project implementation from the national&#13;
systems designer consultant, and the international consultant in survey design, implementation&#13;
and data analysis.&#13;

Technical Assistance Required under the Project&#13;
Finwcial Management and Procurement Unit (FMtPU&#13;
10.12 Based on an analysis of current capacities within Government, and an assessment of&#13;
alternative options, it was agreed with Government that a separate unit be formed and charged&#13;
with all financial management and procurement responsibilities under the CRRP. It was further&#13;
agreed with Government that this unit would be set up and managed by a capable firm that would&#13;
be contracted through intemational tendering procedures. Detailed Terms of Reference for the&#13;
FMPU and its key staff were prepared, discussed and agreed upon by the GOSL, AflDB and the&#13;
World Bank prior to negotiations. Employment of a suitable firm to set up and operate the FMPU&#13;
will be a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
10.13 The FMPU will ensure that all contracting, procurement, disbursement and financial&#13;
management functions required under the two national programs are carried out in accordance&#13;
with standard and accepted guidelines of the donor agencies supporting these two programs.&#13;
The FMPU will prepare all financial management reports, payments requests, and other&#13;
documentation required of the Commission and Committee by the GOSL and donor agencies.&#13;
The Unit will also be responsible for overseeing the Special and Project Accounts, maintaining&#13;
adequate documentation of financial transactions, and initiating payments for all Project contracts&#13;
which have been authorized by NCRRR and NCDDR The Unit Manager will report to NCRRR,&#13;
NCDDR and MOFDEP in the execution of these functions. The draft organizational chart, teins&#13;
of reference and detailed job descriptions for FMPU staff are shown in Attachment 4.&#13;
TechnicalAssistance to the ERSF&#13;
10.14  Due to the innovative nature of the ERSF, and the limited in-country experience with&#13;
such social fund-type mechanisms, Govermnent will also seek assistance in the form of a&#13;
technical advisor to the ERSF, initially for 12 months, to: (i) provide key institutional support for&#13;
the operationalization of the Fund; (ii) work closely with regional ERSF staff in sub-project&#13;
appraisal and institutional assessment techniques; (iii) assist and train NCRRR central-level staff&#13;
in Fund management and monitoring; (iv) help ensure timely flow of approved resources for&#13;
ERSF implementation to both NCRRR units and sub-project implementing partners; (v) provide&#13;
guidance to NCRRR in assisting implementing partners on proposal development, sub-project&#13;
implemnentation, monitoring, evaluation, etc.; and (vi) assist NCRRR to revise and update&#13;
systems, procedures, etc. as and when needed to ensure efficient and effective ERSF&#13;
implementation. Draft terms of reference for the position are presented in Attachment 6.&#13;
TechnicalAssistance to DDR&#13;
10.15 Given the unique nature and sensitivity of the DDR program, and the fict that little in-&#13;
country expertise exists in the critical areas of responsibility of NCDDR, it is expected that the&#13;
Executive Secretariat will require substantial technical assistance support particularly during the&#13;
rapid and complex start-up phase of the Program. At present, it is proposed that four long-term&#13;
advisors (of 12 months each) would support each of the line units of the ES/NCDDR in the areas&#13;
of reintegration, information and sensitization, monitoring and evaluation, and disannament and&#13;
demobilization. Nonetheless, given the dynamic environment in which the DDR Program is&#13;
operating, the on-going consultant services needs of this component the Project will be reviewed&#13;
and updated after six months of implementation. IDA will support part of the costs of the&#13;
&#13;

10.16 It has been agreed that the proposed project be audited semi-annually by an independent&#13;
public accounting firm acceptable to IDA. Given the decentralized nature of the project, and the&#13;
many implementing partners contemplated under the Project, semi-annual audits will provide the&#13;
NCRRR and NCDDR with valuable and timely management informaton and help ensure&#13;
accountability and tansparency. Draft terms of reference for the semi-annually audit are&#13;
included as Attachment 8.&#13;

11. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
11.1  The implementation structures, responsibilities and specific institutional arrangements for&#13;
the Emergency Recovery Support Fund are detailed in the Project's Operational Manual&#13;
developed during Project preparation and appraisal, and updated at the time of post-appraisal.&#13;
The Operational Manual specifies the roles and responsibilities of both NCRRR and its&#13;
implementing partners to access and monitor the use of funds available under the ERSF The&#13;
manual, contained in the Project File, also provides the standard forms, guidelines, evaluation&#13;
critena and contacts for implementation of the Fund. A similar operational manual for the TEP&#13;
has been prepared, is being piloted during the Project's preparation phase, and will be updated&#13;
once the Project becomes effective. All other procurement and disbursement procedures and&#13;
responsibilities for the institutional support components of the Project will abide by the relevant&#13;
standard World Bank and IDA guidelines as specified in the Development Credit Agreement for&#13;
the Project.&#13;
Implementation Structures&#13;
11.2 The GOSL has given the responsibility of overseeing the CRRP to NCRRR and NCDDR.&#13;
While these two institutions will coordinate and monitor the CRRP, partner organizations such as&#13;
NGOs, line ministry units, parastatal organimzations and community based organizations will be&#13;
responsible for implementing specific activities under the Project. The Commissioner, NCRRR,&#13;
and the Executive Secretary, NCDDR, will be directly responsible to the World Bank for the use&#13;
of Project resources and will jointly report to IDA on the performance of the Project.&#13;
11.3 The Project relies on a decentralized implementation structure. NCRRR will have&#13;
12 district offices staffed with 3 technicians who will promote community participation and&#13;
monitor implementation of ERSF subprojects. It is proposed that, at regional level, NCRRR and&#13;
NCDDR will have a joint regional offices (one in each of the provincial capitals; Bo, Kenema and&#13;
Makeni, and one in Freetown/Waterloo for Western Area); each staffed with five to six technical&#13;
personnel per institution. The regional offices and personnel will coordinate CRRP activities&#13;
with regional line ministry offices, NGOs, and other implementing partners; participate in the&#13;
approval of ERSF and TEP sub-projects; and report on Project implementation to the national&#13;
level offices.&#13;
11.4  At national level, NCRRR has three technical units responsible for supporting the CRRP;&#13;
the Directorate of Programming and Coordination, the Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation, and the Information and Sensitization Unit. NCDDR has four technical units&#13;
responsible for overseeing activities under the CRRP, namely Disarmament and Demobilization,&#13;
Reinsertion and Reintegration, Information and Sensitization, and the Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Units. Each unit is headed up by an experienced and qualified professional who is supported by&#13;
one to three technical officers.&#13;
11.5  The IDA Credit will help to finance core investment and recurrent costs for both NCRRR&#13;
and NCDDR at central and regional levels to facilitate the day-to-day management of the&#13;
respective components of the Project. These costs for NCRRR will be shared with UNDP and&#13;
AfDB, while costs for NCDDR will be shared with DFID and other interested donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TechnicalAnnex                      Project Titk: Commnunity Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;

Due to weaknesses in local, in-country, capacities resulting from the coup and prolonged civil&#13;
service decline, and taking into consideration the temporary nature of both the NCRRR and&#13;
NCDDR, Government will delegate responsibility for the Project's financial management and&#13;
procurement functions to a separate and autonomous unit to be contracted through international&#13;
competitive bidding procedures. This unit, to be known as the Financial Management and&#13;
Procurement Unit (FMPU), will manage all procurement for NCRRR and the Executive&#13;
Secretariat of NCDDR, be responsible for all contracting and disbursements under the Project,&#13;
oversee management of the local Multi-Donor Trust Fund account, and ensure proper record&#13;
keeping and reporting for the Credit in accordance with appropriate World Bank guidelines.&#13;
Project Coordination&#13;
11.6  Project Coordination will be achieved through several existing mechanisms operational at&#13;
national and regional levels. First, there are general coordinating institutions, such as the&#13;
Consultative Forum at national level, and the Inter-agency Forums at regional levels. Both of&#13;
these structures, which are described in more detail in Chapter 4, serve a particularly important&#13;
role in the CRRP. The Consultative Forum helps to coordinate activities across sectoral lines and&#13;
between NGOs and line ministries with NCRRR. This is particularly relevant in the emergency&#13;
recovery activities where rapid technical responses call for integrated information and&#13;
public/private cooperation. This Forum meets fortnightly and is chaired by NCRRR. Regional&#13;
Inter-agency Forums (IAF) serve to keep the CRRP in close contact with the key implementing&#13;
partners at regional level, and to provide a forum to discuss and resolve local level&#13;
implementation concerns or to respond to emergencies. The IAFs will also help in the initial&#13;
review of ERSF sub-project proposals to ensure appropriate targeting and avoid overlap or&#13;
conflict with other implementing partners. The LAF also meets fortnightly and is chaired by the&#13;
Regional Coordinator of NCRRR.&#13;
11.7  Secondly, there are technically specialized inter-agency bodies that will contribute to&#13;
improving Project coordination and implementation. These bodies, such as the Committee on&#13;
Food Aid, the Child Protection Committee, and the Health and Nutrition Committee, exist at both&#13;
national and regional levels, are composed of the relevant line ministry and NGOs active in the&#13;
given technical area, and liaise with the general coordination bodies at the different levels. These&#13;
institutions will serve the Project in two ways; by establishing and enforcing technical norms or&#13;
standards in the given technical area concerned, and, possibly, as sub-project evaluators.&#13;
11.8  In-country, the exceptionally high and constructive level of coordination exhibited in&#13;
Sierra Leone is the result of a strong working relationship that the UN Office for the Coordination&#13;
of Humanitarian Affairs has established with the Government and the NGO community. It is&#13;
expected that UN/OCHA will continue to play a critical role in supporting and facilitating this&#13;
type of coordination to the benefit the Project.&#13;
11.9   On the international level, the Government has taken important steps to improve&#13;
coordination with its development partners. For instance, the International Contact Group (ICG)&#13;
was established following the UN special meeting on Sierra Leone in July 1998. Chaired by&#13;
DPID, the ICG strives to assist the Government to consolidate support for the DDR phase of its&#13;
national program. In addition, the Government has requested that the World Bank establish a&#13;
Multi-Donor Trust Fund that will be used to facilitate financing of DDR-relatd activities by&#13;
interested donor countries and organizations. This formal consultative body and administrative&#13;
mechanism will greatly enhance the level of coordination between Government and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

its development partners that, in turn, will help to ensure more efficient use of resources during&#13;
project and program implementation.&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
11.10 Performance monitoring of the CRRP will focus on two distinct levels: first, at overall&#13;
program level for the NRRRP and the NDDRP (i.e., the development objectives, outcomes and&#13;
core assumptions and preconditions as shown in the Project's Summary Table contained in&#13;
Attachment 3), and second, at detailed Project component and activity level (outputs,&#13;
implementation, managerial efficiency, and detailed progran assumptions- again indicated in the&#13;
Project Summary Table). This table is a Logical Framework matrix that includes a detailed list of&#13;
performance indicators for program objectives and outcomes, Project outputs and inputs, and core&#13;
assumptions and related risks. These indicators will be used to measure the performance of the&#13;
NDDRP and NRRRP, as well as the CRRP. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Systems will be&#13;
established at the NCRRR and the Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR The two systems will be&#13;
developed using the same software platform, and be compatible in terms of coding of basic data.&#13;
Thus it will be possible to follow ex-combatants from the targeted program (i.e., the NDDRP) to&#13;
the broad-based program (i.e., NRRRP).&#13;
i 1.11  The M&amp;E system of NCRRR will be designed to allow the Commission to (i) analyze the&#13;
effectiveness of the ERSF review process; (ii) quantify sub-project outputs by sector, by region,&#13;
and by beneficiary type - including ex-combatants - and gender; (iii) assess level and quality of&#13;
community and local institutional participation in sub-project design and implementation; and&#13;
(iv) measure the impact of assistance in terms of increased agricultural production, expansion of&#13;
social services, increased economic activity, and strengthening of community institutions. The&#13;
M&amp;E system of the NCDDR will enable the Executive Secretariat to, among others: (i) establish&#13;
detailed, gender desegregated, socioeconomic baselines/profiles; (ii) trace overtime participation&#13;
of individual ex-combatants in the DDRP (reception of assistance package, participation&#13;
orientation, taining and reintegration activities); (iii) assess implementation efficiency;&#13;
(iv) assess the level of social and economic reintegation of ex-combatants.&#13;
11.12 The Project will monitor the institutional strengthening of NCRRR and NCDDR in&#13;
several ways. First, Government will report on the delivery of all identified Project-financed&#13;
inputs as part of the quarterly statements of accounts and progress reports. Government will also&#13;
review and analyze progress made in implementing work plans (shown in Attachment 8) as part&#13;
of the quarterly progress reports. The Project will also monitor how quickly key Project staff&#13;
have been hired, and the respective regional offices operationalized. Timely submission of all&#13;
Project related reports (quarterly statements of accounts, semi-annual progress reports, and semi-&#13;
annual audit reports) will also serve as a measure of institutional capacity. The successful&#13;
operation of the FMPU will be judged based on the quarterly consultancy reports to be provided&#13;
by the contacted firm; the timeliness and accuracy of SOE's, payment requests, and other&#13;
applications and withdrawals; the quality of procurement documentation submitted for IDA non-&#13;
objection; and the efficiency of the procurement process. Finally, general Project implementation&#13;
will be judged based on the semi-annual audits reports and the qualified observations, if any,&#13;
therein.&#13;
11.13 The successful establishment and operation of both the ERSF and the TEP will be also be&#13;
closely monitored. Both are innovative implementation stategies and based on several critical&#13;
assumptions that need.to be verified. For instance, the degree to which inter-agency bodies and&#13;
technical commitees will effectively serve in sub-project review, the level of community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;

involvement in sub-project design, and local NGO capacity for sub-project implementation are&#13;
areas where certain assumptions need to be tested. These issues will be analyzed in detail as part&#13;
of a comprehensive review planned for the Project following the six-month pilot phase. The&#13;
Govemment will also report to the Bank on other sub-project implementation indicators such as&#13;
the amount of time it takes from proposal submission to Projects Committee review to contracting&#13;
(in the case of successful proposals); level of committed finds; number and gender of direct sub-&#13;
project beneficiaries; numbers and value of sub-projects by sectoral and geographic area, and type&#13;
of implementing partner to determine if any biases exist in sub-project selection; and average lag-&#13;
time for authorized sub-project disbursements.&#13;
11.14 Beyond the Project's institutional structures and implementation mechanisms, the&#13;
Government will also tack and report on the output and impact indicators specific to the sub-&#13;
projects being financed under the Project. For instance, basic data on agricultural rehabilitation&#13;
and production, refurbishment of infiastructure and delivery of basic services, reconstruction of&#13;
economic assets and revival of productive activities, and rebuilding of social institutions will be&#13;
collected through the Project's monitoring system. These data will, over time, indicate to both the&#13;
Government and the Bank if the Project is achieving its general objectives.&#13;
11.15 Each implementing agency (NGO, line ministry, etc.) will be responsible for providing&#13;
the regional NCRRR and NCDDR offices with information on monthly sub-project outputs in&#13;
either computerized or written form. This data will be consolidated at the regional level,&#13;
reviewed by the regional ERSF Comnittee and respective institution, and sent forward to the&#13;
central level monitoring units of either NCRRR or NCDDR for analysis and reporting to funding&#13;
agencies. The form and substance of this sub-project monitoring infornation will be defined as&#13;
part of the formal contract entered into between the Government and the implementing partner.&#13;
11.16  The Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation of NCRRR, and the Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation Unit of NCDDR have overall responsibility for monitoring and reporting to the&#13;
Bank on the implementation of the CRRP. These units will be responsible for developing the&#13;
quarterly progress reports that will contain consolidated information on the Project's institutional&#13;
and physical progress. The FMPU is responsible for preparing the quarterly statements of&#13;
accounts and providing relevant financial information to the Commission and the Executive&#13;
Secretariat for the semi-annual progress reports.&#13;
11.17 Both M&amp;E units will set up and maintain a monitoring and evaluation system that will be&#13;
compatible and allow for the integration of data between both institutions. Central-level Program&#13;
Managers from each institution will be responsible for ensuring that regional offices submit&#13;
monthly consolidated progress reports, maintaining and updating the M&amp;E database, analyzing&#13;
performance data, and helping in the design and implementation of specialized studies as needed.&#13;
A database program will be designed for the collection and analysis of Project monitoring data&#13;
using off-the-shelf computer software. Consultants have assisted NCDDR in the design,&#13;
computenzation, set-up and initial data entry for the Lungi registration activity, and technical&#13;
assistance is currently being provided through the Multi-donor Trust Fund to design and develop&#13;
the overall DDR M&amp;E system. Similar assistance will be provided for the development of&#13;
NCRRR's M&amp;E system using PPF funds or through a grant from DFID. The TORs for this&#13;
position are shown in Attachment 10). On-going technical assistance support is also envisioned&#13;
under the Credit to help in the analysis of data, training of staff in system use, and the&#13;
development and conduct of specialized beneficiary assessments. Each Project year, the&#13;
Government and the Bank will agree on a list of indicators, and annmal target levels, to be used to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

11.19 ERSFSub-projects. The Emergency Recovery Support Fund is a social fund delivery&#13;
mechanism designed to support demand driven community based sub-projects prepared jointly by&#13;
communities  and  selected  implementing  partners.    Therefore,  specialized  procedures  for&#13;
contracting with implementing agencies (NGOs, line ministries, etc.) have been designed to take&#13;
into consideration the substantive involvement of both the community and the implementing&#13;
organization in the preparation and implementation of the sub-project. These procedures are&#13;
described in detail in the Project's Operational Manual. The sub-projects will be carried out by&#13;
implementing partners with technical oversight from NCRRR, NCDDR and relevant line&#13;
ministries as appropriate.&#13;

11.20 Sub-projects will be prepared in conformance with broad sectoral guidelines established&#13;
for the CRRP. Review and evaluation of both sub-projects and potential implementing partners&#13;
are based on detailed criteria that measure institutional capacity, project coherence, financial&#13;
soundness, community participation, environmental impact and sub-project sustainability.&#13;
Appropnate technical staff from NCRRR, NCDDR, and line ministries will review both&#13;
organizaions and sub-project designs using standard criteria, technical specifications and unit&#13;
costs by sub-project type.&#13;
11.21 NCRRR and NCDDR will have responsibility for overseeing the contracting of&#13;
implementing agencies for sub-projects. The Finanial Management and Procurement Unit will&#13;
ensure that contracting is done in accordance with appropriate World Bank Guidelines. Regional&#13;
inter-agency committees will have authority to approve sub-projects up to US$50,000 in value;&#13;
projects above this threshold will require cental-level NCRRR1NCDDR approval. World Bank&#13;
prior review will be required for sub-project contracts valued at USS200,000, or more. The&#13;
capacity of the regional committees, NCRRR, NCDDR and the FMPU to adequately manage the&#13;
procurement responsibilities under the Project will be tested during a pilot phase carried out with&#13;
PPF support.&#13;
11.22 Goods. Procurement of goods (including vehicles, equipment, and furniture) under the&#13;
institutional support sub-components of the Project will be carried out in accordance with World&#13;
Bank procedures as laid out in, "Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" of&#13;
January 1995 (revised August 1996 and September 1997). Contracts for goods estimated to cost&#13;
US$200,000 or more will follow standard international competitive bidding procedures&#13;
acceptable to the World Bank. Contracts for less than US$200,000 (up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
USS200,000) may be procured using national competitive bidding procedures per paragraphs 3.3&#13;
and 3.4 of said Guidelines. Contracts for goods estimated to cost less than US$50,000 may be&#13;
procured using national shopping (up to an aggregate amount of US$150,000) and international&#13;
shopping (up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000). Prior World Bank review for bidding&#13;
documents and contract award will be required for any single contract in excess of US$100,000.&#13;
11.23 The Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) will have responsibility for&#13;
compiling procurement requests and preparing standard documentation to effect all procurement&#13;
under the Project. World Bank standard bidding forms, documents and contracts will be used by&#13;
the Unit for this purpose. The FMPU will also assist sub-project implementing agencies prepare&#13;
standard bid documents and carry out bulk procurement of necessary inputs as and when&#13;
required.&#13;
11.24 Serices. All technical assistance and consulting services under the Project will be&#13;
procured in accordance with the standard guidelines for the selection and employment of&#13;
consultants by World Bank borrowers (January 1997, revised September 1997 and January 1999).&#13;
All technical assistance services worth US$50,000 and more will be contracted for using Quality-&#13;
and Cost-Based Selection procedures as described in Section 11 of the Guidelines. Audit services&#13;
required under the Project will be secured using least-cost procedures in accordance with&#13;
pargraph 3.6 of the Guidelines, and all local technical assistance needs valued at less than&#13;
US$50,000 per contract will be selected based on consultants' qualifications as described in&#13;
pargraph 3.7 of the Guidelines.&#13;
11.25 Service contracts estimated to be worth more than US$50,000 for individuals, and&#13;
US$100,000 for finns, will require World Bank prior review and no-objection for: (i) the terms of&#13;
reference for the services, (ii) short-list of individuals or firms, (iii) request for proposal,&#13;

required for: (i) tenms of reference for services to be financed under the Credit, (ii) relevant&#13;
documentation for services to be contacted for using single source method of procurement, and&#13;
(iii) the modification of any service contract that exceeds, or would exceed as a result of the&#13;
modification, the previously indicated prior review thresholds. The Financial Management and&#13;
Procurement Unit will ensure that appropriate standard documentation (including RFPs,&#13;
evaluation reports, lump sum or complex time-based contrats, etc.) are prepared and that World&#13;
Bank guidelines are applied in contacting technical assistance services for the Project.&#13;
Procurement Planning and Monitoring&#13;
11.26 Prior to Project start-up, the Government will prepare the procurement plan for the&#13;
overall Project, and provide a draft General Procurement Notice for World Bank non-objection,&#13;
and subsequent publication in United Nations Development Business. Subsequently, the FMPU&#13;
will take principal responsibility for coordinating all aspects of procurement under the Project for&#13;
NCRRR and NCDDR.&#13;
11.27 The World Bank will monitor the proper implementation of procurement procedures&#13;
continuously for those goods and services which exceed the prior review thresholds as described&#13;
above. For other contracts that fill below these thresholds, the World Bank will monitor the&#13;
approprate application of Bank procedures through post reviews during the semi-annual&#13;
supervision missions. Furthermore, the Bank will require that the audit firm carrying out the&#13;
semi-annual audits for the Project assess and provide an opinion on whether or not proper&#13;
procurement procedures are being followed as defined in the Credit Agreement.&#13;
Disbursements, Financial Management and Auditing&#13;
11.28 For the purpose of this Project, an IDA Credit of US$25 million equivalent will be&#13;
disbursed over a period of three years in accordance with the table presented below.&#13;

11.30 The Government will open an account in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA for the&#13;
purpose of the Special Account at a level of US$1 million. The Government also will establish&#13;
and maintain a separate Project Account in local currency at a level of USS250,000, equivalent,&#13;
for all Government counterpart contributions to the Project. The FMPU will manage both&#13;
accounts on behalf of the Government; two signatories will be required on both accounts,&#13;
one from the FMPU (the Unit Manager or his/her designee) and one from NCRRR (either the&#13;
Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner) for related NCRRR expenditures or commitments,&#13;
or one from NCDDR (either the Executive Secretary or the Director of Reinsertion and&#13;
Reintegration) for related expenditures or commitments. Replenishment of the Special Account&#13;
will be made based on satisfactory review of appropriate documentation prepared and submitted&#13;
by the Government. The Government will anange for replenishment of the Project Account on a&#13;
quarterly, or as need, basis. Withdrawal applications for direct payment and special commitments&#13;
wil be made for payments of no less than 20% of the Special Account value. All necessary&#13;
documentation supporting Project related disbursements will be maintained by the FMPU for&#13;
inspection by Bank supervision missions and independent auditors.&#13;
11.31 The Government will finance ten percent for all locally procured goods (office fumiture,&#13;
equipment and vehicles), and twenty percent of all operating costs associated with the Project.&#13;
Furermore, IDA will only reimburse a maximum of ninety percent of the total sub-project costs,&#13;
with the balance being met by either the Govermment, the implementing parter or the commumty&#13;
itself with in-kind contributions. The table below indicates the level of financing for each&#13;
category of expenditure under the Project, and the limits on IDA contributions.&#13;

11.33 IDA staff and consultants will supervise the Project at least semi-annually. The tentative&#13;
timetable and estimate of staff time and technical assistance needs for these missions are shown&#13;
in the Supervision Table presented below. As an Emergency Credit, this Project will not require&#13;
a nid-term review, however, a special assessment of the ERSF will be carried out after&#13;
six months miplementation, scheduled for May 2000. In addition, IDA will provide ongoing&#13;
supervision and support to the Prcject through the review of consultant reports, audit statements,&#13;
procurement and disbursement actions, and day-to-day communications.&#13;
11.34 The Government will facilitate Bank supervision of the Project by preparing and making&#13;
available to IDA quarterly financial statements of accounts and physical progress reports that will&#13;
quantify and discuss the Project's performance in accordance with the agreed upon indicators. In&#13;
addition, the Government will carry out annual Project review and performance workshops with&#13;
implementing partners to assess Project implementation and design assumptions, and to make&#13;
adjustments in Project implementation as appropriate. An Implementation Completion Report&#13;
will be prepared by the Government and transmitted to IDA within six months of Credit closing.&#13;

Transparency and Accountability&#13;
11.35 The Government fully appreciates the need for transparency and accountability in the&#13;
Project implementation process to avoid duplication of effort and unnecessary wastage of scarce&#13;
resources. Inter-Agency Forums (IAF) and Projects Committees at regional and national levels&#13;
will provide an open environment for the interaction of Government, implementing partners, and&#13;
target beneficiaries in relation to activities financed under the Project. These fora will serve in&#13;
the selection of implementing partners and sub-project activities based on clear and objective&#13;
criteria. The sub-project selection criteria will be widely publicized and disseminated among all&#13;
potential implementing agencies; NCRRR has already taken the initiative to provide this&#13;
information to the partner organizations. Furthennore, the sub-project review process will be&#13;
recorded and subject to external audit if questions anse. Finally, the inter-agency nature of the&#13;
IAF and the ERSF Projects Committees provides additional transparency to the respective review&#13;
processes.&#13;
11.36 Once sub-projects are approved for implementation, funds will be made available to&#13;
implementing agencies as stipulated in the corresponding contracts. Systems will be developed&#13;
and staff contracted that have direct and ongoing responsibility for overseeing the use of physical,&#13;
miaterial and financial resources, and in measuring performance of the Project based on agreed&#13;
upon input, output and outcome indicators. Monthly technical and financial reports, and quarterly&#13;
progress reports will be prepared by implementing partners and reviewed by NCRRR and&#13;
NCDDR staff and the Projects Committees. An evaluation report will be prepared for all sub-&#13;
projects at the end of the program period. NCRRR and NCDDR will also compile monthly&#13;
physical progress and quarterly qualitative progress reports on Project implementation as well as&#13;
conduct periodic site surveys and beneficiary assessments of sub-projects for IDA and other&#13;
donor review.&#13;
11.37 Ultimately, the proper application of Project criteria and guidelines will be ensured&#13;
through semi-annual audits of Project accounts by an independent public accounting firm. In&#13;
addition to providing an opinion as to the status and use of Project funds, the auditor will also&#13;
assess Government and sub-project implementing partners' compliance with the appropriate&#13;
procurement and disbursement requirements under the Project. IDA will also carry out at least&#13;
semi-annual supervision missions to help maintain the highest degree of accountability.&#13;

12. SPECIFIC DELIVERY MECHANISMS&#13;
12.1  The unique naure of the Government's programs to address both reinsertion and&#13;
rehabilitation efforts call for specialized implementation structures and delivery mechansms. In&#13;
response, the Government has prepared detailed procedures and guidelines for the Emergency&#13;
Recovery Support Fund (ERSF) and for the Training and Employment Program.. The Operations&#13;
Manual for the ERSF was developed in 1997 and was updated in late 1998. Similarly,&#13;
procedures for the TEP were developed in 1998 and have been updated and refined in 1999. Both&#13;
Operations Manuals have been reviewed by IDA and the most recent versions of these manuals&#13;
are contained in the Project File. While aspects of both the ERSF and the TEP have been&#13;
highlighted in the previous sections of the Technical Annex, this chapter more fully describes the&#13;
systems and procedures central to the operation of these two program funding mechanisms.&#13;
The ERSF&#13;
12.2  The Emergency Recovery Support Fund is a demand-driven social fund that allows the&#13;
Government great flexibility in responding to the needs of recovery and reintegration. The Fund&#13;
will be used to address the resettlement and reconstruction efforts as well as support labor-&#13;
intensive public works net program that are of concern to the NCRRR.&#13;
12.3  The ERSF was developed by the Government in recognition of three important facts&#13;
about post-conflict emergencies in general and the state of Sierra Leone in particular: (i) it is&#13;
essential that assistance be delivered to the people and communities most affected by the conflict&#13;
as quicldy as possible so that further deterioration can be avoided, (ii) a multi-sectoral approach is&#13;
required given the extent of social and economic destruction associated with conflicts, and&#13;
(iii) the GOSL line ministries and other authorities could not be counted on to respond as required&#13;
given their bureaucratic and overly centralist natures, inadequate inter-ninisterial coordination,&#13;
and their overall weakened capacities. The decentralized and autonomous nature of the Fund, and&#13;
the fact that it builds on the implementation capacity of local and intemational NGOs, as well as&#13;
local level government departnents, is an appropriate design and one that responds well to the&#13;
challenges of post-conflict situations. The ERSF is being piloted under the PPF, and the&#13;
Govemment intends to conduct a detailed review of its operation after six months to make&#13;
appropriate changes to the implementation strategies or administrative systems. Terms of&#13;
reference for the assessment of the pilot phase of the Project and implementation of the ERSF are&#13;
contained in Attachment 12.&#13;
12.4  Implementation of the ERSF depends on a decentalized management structure and inter-&#13;
agency collaboration. Six structures are critical to the Fund: (i) the existing regional Inter-agency&#13;
Forums, (ii) the regional ERSF Projects Committees, (iii) the technical secretariat based in each&#13;
Regional NCRRR office, (iv) the existing technical committees or task forces also operating in&#13;
each of the three regional (provincial) capitals, (v) the National ERSF Projects Committee, and&#13;
(vi) the Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU). Each body and its general&#13;
responsibilities are described below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TechnicalAnnex                         Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;
County: Sierra Leone                                                         Page 62 of87&#13;
12.5   The existing Inter-agency Forums will provide broad-based, multi-sectoral and inter-&#13;
agency feedback to the sub-project approval and monitoring process. This body is chaired by the&#13;
NCRRR Regional Coordinator and serves as the forum for general information exchange and&#13;
identification of potential problems or conflicts in ERSF project design and implementation. All&#13;
proposed projects will be presented to this body before a detailed review is conducted by NCRRR&#13;
staff and the appropriate technical body so as to draw upon the collective knowledge of the&#13;
broader development community in the regions. Membership in this forum is open to all&#13;
interested parties and potential implementing partners throughout the region.&#13;
12.6 Each region will establish an ERSF Projects Committee which will have responsibility&#13;
for reviewing and approving sub-projects up to the threshold level of $US 50,000, equivalent.&#13;
This Committee will be composed of 2 NCRRR staff (the Regional Coordinator and one other&#13;
staff member"1) the HACU regional officer, the regional MOFDEP representative, and one&#13;
representative of the implementing partners who will be nominated by the Inter-agency Forum.12&#13;
The Regional Coordinator will chair the Committee.'3&#13;
12.7   Each region will have an ERSF technical secretariat, consisting of two projects officers&#13;
and one finance officer, who will carry out the day-to-day adminmtrave tasks associated with&#13;
ERSF sub-project review and monitoring. While the secretariat is responsible to the Projects&#13;
Committee, on a day-to-day basis these staff will report to the regional NCRRR Coordinator.&#13;
12.8   As neither the ERSF Projects Committee nor the technical secretariat will necessarily&#13;
have all the information or technical knowledge to adequately assess all types of proposals,&#13;
existing technical sub-committees will be called upon to review specific technical aspects of&#13;
sub-project proposals submitted to the ERSF. The NCRRR Regional Coordinator would seek the&#13;
cooperation of the relevant technical committees or ad hoc groups through the appropriate line&#13;
ministry or public authority (such as SLRA), and will have access to necessary resources to&#13;
facilitate individual and committee members input to this process.&#13;
12.9   A National ERSF Projects Committee will be formed at central level to: (i) approve or&#13;
reject all recommended sub-projects that exceed the regional approval threshold of US$50,000'4,&#13;
(ii) review and approve all urban public works projects that target the unemployed of Greater&#13;
Freetown, and (iii) review and approve all project proposals that are national in scope such as&#13;
those presented by central level line ministries. The National Committee will be chaired by the&#13;
NCRRR Director for Programming &amp; Coordination, and wil include the Director for Planning,&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation; the Director of the SAPA Program; a representative for the&#13;
10 In order to ensure smooth processing and a period for regional capacity-building, all sub-projects above USS25,000&#13;
equivalent will have to be approved by the National ERSF Projects Committee m Freetown duinng the first 6 months&#13;
of ERSF implementation.&#13;
Duing the pilot phase, the second NCRRR person will be a hedquate staff to help ensr proper implementation&#13;
of ERSF procedures and to help bild the capacity of the regional committees and review process.&#13;
12 The IAF will nominate 1 representative and I altemnate so as to avoid any conflict of interest in the event that a&#13;
proposal is submitted by the LAF represetative's implementing organization.&#13;
3 The feasibility of including a beneficiary representative on the Projects Committee will be considered as part of the&#13;
six-month review of the ERSF pilot phase.&#13;
4 Sub-project contracts equal to or exceeding $200,000 will also require the non-objection of the World Bank.&#13;

12.10 Finally, the Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) will be&#13;
established to assist NCRRR with all aspects of contracting, disbursements, financial&#13;
management and reporting in relation to the ERSF, as well as other donor financed activities&#13;
within the Commission. Once an ERSF project is approved and contracts are signed by the&#13;
Commission, the FMPU will manage all direct payments made to implementing partners and will&#13;
ensure that financial reporting and record keeping is in line with GOSL and donor requirements,&#13;
and internationally accepted accounting standards.&#13;

ERSF Sub-Project Proposal, Review &amp; Approval Procedures&#13;
Sub-Project Proposal Development&#13;
12.11 Potential implementing partners first contact NCRRR to receive appropriate guidance in&#13;
preparing a sub-project proposals. For this purpose, NCRRR has developed guidelines and&#13;
standard formats to assist implementing partners in the proposal development process. While&#13;
information will be available at all NCRRR central, regional, and district offices, partners will be&#13;
encouraged to contact the appropriate regional or district level office nearest the point where the&#13;
sub-project would be implemented.&#13;
12.12 Implementing agencies will present project ideas, or concepts, to the Inter-agency Forum&#13;
for review and comment prior to submission of a full proposal. This review is designed to ensure&#13;
better coordination of development activities in the region, and to identify any potential problems&#13;
or concerns in the design of the project. The implementing partner will be encouraged to present&#13;
the sub-project concept to the IAF directly, however, if an organization cannot be present at the&#13;
IAF meeting, NCRRR staff (either district or regional) can present the sub-project concept on&#13;
behalf bf the implementing partner. NCRRR will develop a standard form that implementing&#13;
partners can use to prepare and submit this brief project summary to the ERSF project officer at&#13;
the regional NCRRR office. The project officer would then determine when the summary would&#13;
be presented to the LAF based on the volume and backlog of proposals, and the other duties of the&#13;
LAW. A project concept must be reviewed by the L4F before it can be consideredforjunding by&#13;
NCRRR&#13;
12.13 Once the LAF has reviewed and commented upon a project idea, an implementing partner&#13;
can present a full sub-project proposal to NCRRR taking into consideration any comments or&#13;
concems raised by the LAF. Sub-project proposals should be submitted directly to the NCRRR&#13;
regional office, however, district and chiefdom based organizations may submit proposals to&#13;
NCRRR through the district offices if more convenient. District staff will have no direct&#13;
responsibility for reviewing proposals, however, and will transmit all proposals (and project&#13;
concepts) directly to the regional office for consideration. To be eligible to have a proposal&#13;
considered under the ERSF, an NGO or CBO must have submitted an "NGO Profile" form to&#13;
NCRRR.lS&#13;
ProposalReview&#13;
12.14 Project proposal review will be the main responsibility of the ERSF secretariat staff (the&#13;
Projects and Finance officers at the regional NCRRR office). These staff will first ensure that a&#13;
sub-project and the applicant organization meet basic eligibility criteria (as described in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual). At this same time, the ERSF secretariat staff will verify that any&#13;
comments or concerns raised by the IAF have been taken into consideration in the sub-project&#13;
proposal. If a sub-project or organization is found to be ineligible based on the basic criteria of&#13;
the ERSF, or if the issues raised by the LAF have not been addressed or clarified, the proposal will&#13;
15 The NGO profile can be suibmtted simultaneously with the first sub-project proposal.&#13;

technical review of sub-projects. A technical sub-committee will be required to review and&#13;
respond to the specific technical issues within 5 days of receipt of a proposal (or specific&#13;
technical questions) from NCRRR. The sub-committee will review sub-project proposals to&#13;
determine their technical viability, propose   modifications (if any) and indicate their&#13;
recommendation of the sub-project on technical grounds. Member or members of the sub-&#13;
committee will be able to visit the site of a sub-project or the offices of an applicant agency in&#13;
reviewing the proposal.  The Environmental Protection Department of the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, Forestry and Environment (MAFE) will assist NCRRR with any sub-projects for&#13;
which environmental concerns require further review and analysis. NCRRR regional offices will&#13;
make appropriate resources (e.g. supplies, logistics, trekking allowances, etc.) available to the&#13;
technical sub-committee members to ensure adequate and timely action (including MAFE&#13;
environmental assessments) is taken.&#13;
Sub-Projed Approval&#13;
12.18 Recommendations from both the ERSF secretariat and respective sub-committee will be&#13;
consolidated by the Project Officers and passed on to the ERSF Projects Committee. This&#13;
Committee will meet fortnightly to review the technical recommendations and decide to either&#13;
approve or reject a sub-project proposal, up to a threshold of US$50,000, equivalent. For sub-&#13;
projects above this threshold, the regional ERSF Projects Committee may either reject or&#13;
L~rcdn~fl4 a proposal to the central level for approval. For this purpose, a National ERSF&#13;
Projects Committee will be formed and be given the authority to approve projects over&#13;
US$50,000. The national committee will be composed of the NCRRR Director of Programming&#13;
&amp; Coordination (chair); the Director of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; the Director of the&#13;
SAPA Progam; one representative from the Development Department of MOFDEP; and one&#13;
representative from UN/OCHA. The sub-project review and approval process is illustrated in&#13;
Figure 12-3.&#13;
12.19 NCRRR will manage different sources of funding from different donor agencies.&#13;
Nonetheless, it is hoped that the procedures presented here can be applied to the greatest extent&#13;
possible to all outside funding. However, early in the approval process, the Commission will&#13;
determine which funding mechanism at its disposal would be the most appropriate for a given&#13;
project. By so doing, NCRRR can then take appropriate intenal administtive action to seek&#13;
any special approvals for different programs (such as SAPA) or funding agencies to reduce the&#13;
need for different external procedures or requirements of potential implementing partners.&#13;
ERSF Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Contrading&#13;
12.20 Once a project has been approved, the ERSF Projects Officer in each region will prepare&#13;
the contract for signature based on a standard contract fonnat and required attachments. The&#13;
contract will include a summary description of the project, a detailed implementation plan,&#13;
project budget and disbursement schedule, and customized forms for physical and financial&#13;
progress reporting. Contracts for sub-projects valued at less than US$50,000 will be signed by&#13;
the Regional Coordinator/NCRRR, contacts in excess of this threshold will be signed by the&#13;
Commissioner of NCRRR.&#13;
&#13;

Disbursements and Financial Control&#13;
12.21 The Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FWMPU) will disburse funds to the&#13;
implementing partners for project activities once the Commission has authorized the contract. All&#13;
disbursements will be made based on monthly financial reports, adequate documentation of&#13;
claimed expenditures, and periodic requests for payment submitted by implementing partners to&#13;
the regional ERSF Finance Officers. Inplementing partners will submit monthly reports and&#13;
associated documentation to the Finance Officers no latter than 10 days after the close of the&#13;
preceding month. These reports and requests for payment will be reviewed and consolidated at&#13;
regional level and sent to the FMPU for final review and payment processing. The same&#13;
consolidated report is sent to the ERSF Projects Committee for monitoring purpose. In the event&#13;
of any questions or concerns raised by the regional Finance Officers, the Projects Committee,&#13;
and/or the FMPU, the financial officer will follow-up directly with the implementing partners.&#13;

12.23 NCRRR will require that all sub-projects valued at more thal $50,000, equivalent be&#13;
audited by an independent public accounting firm. The audit should include a review of the&#13;
contactual obligations and restictions for the ERSF sub-project. If an implementing partner&#13;
already conducts annual external audits of its accounts, then this audit will be adequate for&#13;
NCRRR and ERSF purposes, provided that it also reviews the contractual obligations under the&#13;
ERSF. The incremental costs for such audit will be an allowable expense under the ERSF sub-&#13;
project activity.  If a sub-project is valued at less than $50,000, equivalent, and if the&#13;
implementing partner does not have an independent audit of their accounts conducted annually,&#13;
NCRRR will require that all original vouchers for all expenses claimed under ERSF be submitted&#13;
to NCRRR as part of the monthly financial report. Otherwise, copies of invoices and vouchers&#13;
will be adequate for the purposes of financial reporting.&#13;
12.24 To help fwrther guarantee Project accountability, the Internal Control Unit of the FMPU&#13;
will be authorized to carry out spot checks of ERSF sub-project expenditures reported by&#13;
implementing partners. Finally, the semi-annual audits of the overall NCRRR and NCDDR&#13;
operations will also include a random testing of ERSF sub-project activities and expenditures.&#13;
Procurement Procedures for Sub-projects&#13;
12.25 Prior to entering into contract with any implementing partner for an ERSF sub-project&#13;
that would involve substantial procurement, the Government should be satisfied that the systems&#13;
and procedures of the responsible institution will ensure transparent and cost-effective&#13;
procurement. All such sub-project procurement shall be carried out in accordance with&#13;
appropriate World Bank guidelines for goods, works and services, and the thresholds specified&#13;
for the CRRP, as described in previous chapter of this document&#13;
12.26  While the Government expects that certain minimum standard procedures as described&#13;
below will be followed by the implementing agencies, as a general rule, procurement will be the&#13;
responsibility of individual implementing partners and will be carried out directly by these&#13;
agencies. Exceptions to this rule would arise only in inslances where an organization lacks&#13;
adequate experience or capacity to effectively carry out the required level of procurement, or&#13;
when obvious efficiencies may be realized. Under these rare circumstances, the specific method&#13;
and mechanisms for procurement will be highlighted in the contract between Govermnent and&#13;
implementing agency. The FMPU would be available to provide guidance and supply standard&#13;
bidding documents and formats for any specialized procurement that may be called for (such as&#13;
national competitive bidding).&#13;
12.27 Under normal circumstances, procurement under the ERSF will abide by the following&#13;
principles and thresholds:&#13;
*  All procurements under the sub-projects must be supported by appropriate&#13;
documentation, which includes specifications (or terms of reference), request for&#13;
proposal, bid, contract, invoice, and proof of payment.&#13;
* Three profonna invoices are required for procurement of any item with a unit&#13;
acquisition cost estimated to be more than Le. 100,000 (approximately $50).&#13;
*  Any service contract which is valued at more than Le. 1,500,000 (approximately&#13;
$750) must have written terms of reference (or other detailed description of expected&#13;
activities and outputs of the service) which includes minimum qualifications for&#13;
&#13;

contract award, and should be done by comparing at least three (3) qualified persons&#13;
or firms.&#13;
* Any service contract which is valued at more than Le. 25,000,000 (approximately&#13;
$12,500) must be advertised in at least two local newspapers and open to all qualified&#13;
national or international individuals or firms (as determined by the specific type of&#13;
service to be provided).&#13;
*  Contracts for civil works estimated to cost less than Le. 25,000,000 may be procured&#13;
using community participation as per guidelines to be developed by NCRRR which&#13;
meet IDA requirements&#13;
*  Contrcts for works esfimated to cost more than Le. 50,000,000 (approximately&#13;
$25,000), and for goods estimated to cost more than Le. 25,000,000 must be procured&#13;
using established National Competitive Bidding procedures (guidelines to be&#13;
provided by NCRRR).&#13;

12.28 Prior to initiating procurement under the ERSF for any infrastructure or asset to be turned&#13;
over to the community (such as a school, clinic, well, etc.), the Contractor must provide&#13;
Government with an acceptable Operations and Maintenance plan for the structure or asset that&#13;
ensures its sustainability.&#13;
Monitoring andReporting&#13;
12.29 Implementing agencies are required to submit monthly technical reports to the ERSF that&#13;
quantify project outputs and quarterly narrative progress reports providing details of project&#13;
progress and constraints. The Govermuent will identify with the implementing partner prior to&#13;
sub-project implementation the specific indicators of progress and performance for each sub-&#13;
project. These indicators will then be incorporated into the standard forms provided to the&#13;
implementing agencies by the Government so that monitoring of sub-project progress can be&#13;
uniform across similar types of activities.&#13;
12.30 Implementing agencies will submit two copies of each report to NCRRR; one will go to&#13;
the District Supervisor where the project activities are being implemented, and one to the&#13;
Regional Coordinator for the appropriate region. NCDDR will also receive a copy of the&#13;
progress report for those activities that target ex-combatants. As with the financial reports, these&#13;
technical progress reports will be submitted within 10 days of the close of the reporting period.&#13;
Customized formats for reporting technical progress will be designed and made available to&#13;
implementing partners as attachments to the standard ERSF project contract.&#13;
12.31 District Supervisors will receive the reports and be responsible for verifying the&#13;
information presented through regular communications with the implementing partners and field&#13;
visits to the project sites. The regional NCRRR Project Officers, or NCDDR Counselors and&#13;
Employment Promoters, will review and consolidate the progress reports for all active projects in&#13;
the region. The regional offices will have responsibility for entering physical progress data into a&#13;
computerized monitoring system. A consolidated report on all regional projects will be prepared&#13;
by the project officer and presented to the ERSF Projects Committee by the Regional Coordinator&#13;
for review and discussion. A copy of the same report will be sent to the relevant line ministries in&#13;
the region. The consolidated report and the electronic data will also be sent to the Directorate of&#13;
Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (for NCRRR sub-projects), and the Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation Manager (for NCDDR sub-projects) at national level for further consolidation and&#13;
analysis. The respective central M&amp;E units of NCRRR and NCDDR will prepare a quarterly&#13;
progress report on the overall implementation of the ERSF.&#13;
Training and Employment Program&#13;
Overview&#13;
12.32 The Disarmament Demobilization and Reintegration of ex-combatants is an integral part&#13;
of the national peace-building process and Government's reconstruction policy as outlined in its'&#13;
Ninety-Day Program for the Restoration of Democratic Rule in Sierra Leone. The ex-combatants&#13;
constitute a considerable risk group capable of undemining current security gains and therefore&#13;
require targeted assistance. Government realizes that the security benefits of demobilization and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;
Country: Sierra Leone                                                 Page 71 of 87&#13;
reintegration would, in the short-term, come at a financial cost for facilitating the return to&#13;
civilian life; yet in the long term it provides the basis for post war recovery.&#13;
12.33  Given the fact that many ex-combatants have neither finished formal education nor&#13;
acquired marketable skills, the economic outlook for many is bleak. Absorption by the formal&#13;
sector including the civil service, is beyond the reach of unskilled or functionally illiterate ex-&#13;
combatants. Therefore, the need to offer options for economic reintegration, in agriculture and&#13;
informal sector in particular, is clear so as to avoid ex-combatants reverting to rent-seeking at the&#13;
barrel of a gun.&#13;
12.34 In response, the Government has developed the Training and Employment Program&#13;
(TEP), to be coordinated by NCDDR, which will support the social and economic reintegration of&#13;
former combatants through targeted counseling, traimng and employment programs. The TEP is&#13;
a critical strategy of the overall national rehabilitation and reconstruction program that is based on&#13;
other country experiences which clearly show that the disarmament and demobilization of&#13;
combatants is only the beginning of a long and sometimes arduous process of assisting former&#13;
combatants return to their home communities and initiate productive lives.&#13;
12.35 The TEP will assist the approximately 45,000 demobilized ex-combatants of the RUF,&#13;
AFSL, AFRC and CDF currently targeted under the National DDR Program. Potential program&#13;
activities will include employment orientation workshops; short-term skills introduction/training;&#13;
information, counseling and reintegration sensitization, longer-term, market-driven skills training;&#13;
apprenticeships; non-formal literacy and numeracy education; short-term labor-intensive&#13;
employment generation activities, etc.&#13;
12.36 The Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR has been charged with the responsibility of&#13;
overall program planning and implementation of the TEP, which it will do in close collaboration&#13;
with partner organizations such as NGOs, line ministry units, parastat  organizations, training&#13;
institutions, private finns and community based organizations. Donor organizations such as the&#13;
USAID, European Union, GTZ and UNDP will support the efforts of the Executive Secretariat to&#13;
address the re-integraton needs of the former combatants.&#13;
12.37 Under the TEP,the social reintegration program would include civic education, socio-&#13;
pschological counseling and referral programs designed to prepare ex-combatants for their return&#13;
to civilian life, and to assist them by providing critical psycho-social support during the&#13;
reintegration phase.&#13;
12.38 The economic reintegration services would include a vocational orientation, counseling&#13;
on job-seeking strategies, information and counseling on training and employment opportunities&#13;
and advice on establishing micro-projects. The TEP will also offer concrete means for linking&#13;
ex-combatants to training and employment opportunities, and referrals to labor intensive public&#13;
works, broader rehabilitation projects and income generation activities.  Procedures and&#13;
implementation arrangements under the TEP would be tested during six-month pilot phase.&#13;
12.39 The TEP will also provide opportunities for vocational tamining and apprenticeships. The&#13;
program will encourage existing training suppliers to prepare and implement short modular&#13;
training courses that correspond to the educational background of the ex-combatants, their career&#13;
interests, and the needs of the labor market skills development would be provided through a&#13;
contract training scheme and training provider. In the 6-month pilot phase of the program&#13;
rehabilitation of vocational training infrastructure will also be required. Once this capacity has&#13;

been re-established the introduction of subsidies may be provided to ensure that the training is&#13;
sufficiently demand driven and to enable ex-combatants to purchase the training that they feel&#13;
will increase their employability. The TEP will also finance training expenses incurred by&#13;
artisans who train ex-combatants through informal sector apprenticeship. Tool kits would be&#13;
provided upon commencement of the apprenticeship or after completion of the vocational training&#13;
to attract employers.&#13;
12.40 The Reintegration Unit of the NCDDR will coordinate project planning implementation&#13;
and monitoring of all TEP-supported pre-discharge orientation and reintegration assistance to ex-&#13;
combatants subsequent to discharge. The Executive Secretariat will tap into and build upon&#13;
exisfing systems and structures as well as help to build additional capacity among training&#13;
providers as necessary. TEP project proposals can be submitted to NCDDR in one of two ways:&#13;
(i) as a result of a formal Request for Proposals (REP) that would be issued by the Executive&#13;
Secretariat, or (ii) through a demand-driven process where eligible implementing agencies&#13;
identify an area of need in collaboration with ex-combatants and present an unsolicited proposal&#13;
in form and substance acceptable to NCDDR  TEP operating pnnciples, eligibility criteria for&#13;
implementing agencies, and financial requirements for proposals will be similar to those for the&#13;
ERSF. The systems and procedures to be used in implementing the TEP are described in detail in&#13;
the TEP Operations Manual.&#13;
TEPProposai Development, Review andApprovalProcedures&#13;
12.41 Requests for Proposals. Under the TEP, NCDDR will identify specific needs and&#13;
develop specific requests for proposal (RFP) for all pre-discharge orientation activities, and for&#13;
some post-discharge reintegration assistance as well. The central and regional NCDDR staff;&#13;
canp administators, and technical advisors to the Executive Secretariat will all be involved in&#13;
the identification of needs and development of specific terms of reference that will form the basis&#13;
for the RFP. In these cases, specific TORs for services will be developed, standard contracting&#13;
documents prepared, and evaluation criteria identified to be used for evaluating proposals,&#13;
negotiating final agreements, and contracting for services. The general technical criteria noted&#13;
above would be customized to each individual assignment and weightings assigned to each area&#13;
of review. Cost would also be included as an evaluation criteria. The issuing of an RFP by&#13;
NCDDR will be announced in the local newspapers and all interested and eligible organizations&#13;
will be invited to review the documentation and prepare a proposal. Standard World Bank&#13;
guidelines for quality and cost-based selection of consultant services will be used by NCDDR for&#13;
these types of procurement. Detailed technical and financial review of proposals will be carried&#13;
out by a specific evaluation committee formed at the time an RFP is issued.&#13;
12.42 In certain instances, when the anticipated size of a contract is below US$100,000, and&#13;
when speed of response is of the essence, Government may opt to send an RFP directly to a short-&#13;
list of eligible organizations who have been identified earlier and pre-qualified to carry out certain&#13;
type and size activities. In this case, a short-list of no fewer than three and no more than six&#13;
organizations or training institutions will be invited to bid on a specific assigmnent required by&#13;
NCDDR. Organizations will be eligible to apply and be pre-qualified to bid on such assignments&#13;
at any time during the implementation of the Project. Short-listed firms will be selected randomly&#13;
from the most recently updated list of pre-qualified organizations.&#13;
12.43 World Bank no-objection will be required prior to the issuance of any RFPs and the&#13;
signature of any contract with an estimated value of US$100,000 or more for a firm, or&#13;
&#13;

US$50,000 or more for an individual. Furthermore, Bank non-objection will be required for all&#13;
TORs and for any single source contract issued by NCDDR for TEP related assistance, regardless&#13;
of contract value.&#13;
12.44 Unsolicted ProposaL NCDDR also expects that certain reintegration support projects&#13;
will result from a demand-oriented process whereby ex-combatants and eligible implementing&#13;
agencies together formulate an assistance proposal. These proposals might include micro-credit&#13;
assistance, small-scale public works activities, business management taining, or provide for start-&#13;
up capital, etc. In this case, the procedures, formats and guidelines developed for NCRRR's&#13;
Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF) will be adapted and applied to the TEP. These&#13;
formats and procedures have been designed to help standardize proposal submissions and review,&#13;
and are presented and described in detail in the ERSF Operations Manual. Predefined general&#13;
and specific technical criteria would be applied to each unsolicited proposal, similar to the&#13;
procedure under the ERSF. Particular attention would be given to: a) the degree to which the&#13;
proposal reflects the expressed need of the proposed group of ex-combatants, and b) the capacity&#13;
of the implementing agency to cafry out the proposed assistance. If necessary, NCDDR staff&#13;
would seek more specific technical input from relevant line ministries or public agencies&#13;
(for instance, from SLRA in the case that a road works project is submitted) in assessing these&#13;
types of proposals.&#13;
12.45 Under World Bank financed TEP activities, unsolicited proposals would require a&#13;
10 percent counter-part contribution from either the beneficiary group, the implementing partner,&#13;
or the Government. The World Bank would reimburse up to a maximnm of 90 percent of the&#13;
otal value of a TEP financed activity resulting from an unsolicited proposal.&#13;
12.46  Contactng. In the case of RFPs, final project proposals will be negotiated according to&#13;
the procedures laid out in the World Bank guidelines for the selection and employment of&#13;
consulans (January 1997, revised September 1997 and lanuary 1999). Once successfully&#13;
negotiated, contracts will be signed between implementing agencies and the Executive Secretauy&#13;
of NCDDR for defined services. NCDDR will use the standard consultant service contract for&#13;
fixed sum or time-based assignments for contracts resulting from an RFP. For unsolicited&#13;
proposals, NCDDR will use either the approved contract between implementing agencies and the&#13;
GOSL (as shown in the existing Operations Manual for the ERSF), or standard World Bank&#13;
contracts for finns.&#13;
Disbursement and Financial Control under TEP&#13;
12.47 All disbursement and financial control responsibilities under TEP will be managed by the&#13;
Financial Management and Procurement Unit. This unit will be responsible for disbursing funds&#13;
to all consultants, contractors, and vendors on behalf of NCDDR (as well as NCRRR) once&#13;
authorization to do so is given by the respective institution. The FMPU will maintain all financial&#13;
records (including contacts, invoices, financial reports, etc.) related to TEP activities, ensure that&#13;
contractors abide by the financial management and procurement requirements under the Project,&#13;
and prepare all necessary financial reports, requests for payments, etc. required by the World&#13;
Bank and other donors hat support the TEP and the NDDRP. The FMPU will also take&#13;
responsibility for assisting NCDDR with procurement of necessary inputs for the overall Project,&#13;
and, as necessary, assist contractors to procure goods that may be required under the TEP assisted&#13;
activities. Finally, the FMPU will ensure that the internal control procedures for the use of CRRP&#13;
resources (as applied under the TEP as well as other components of the Project) are adhered to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

and that agreed upon review, approval and contracting procedures for the TEP as outlined in this&#13;
procedures manual are maintained.&#13;
12.48 Once a contract is signed between a service provider and the Government, the FMPU will&#13;
take responsibility for the disbursement of funds so that work can be carried out. Contractors will&#13;
be required to submit monthly statements of expenses and periodic- depending on the type and&#13;
schedule of assistance being carried out- requests for reimbursement. NCDDR staff, either the&#13;
regional finance officers, site coordiats, or administator will review these SOEs and&#13;
reimbursement requests to ensure that reported expenses are reasonable and match reported&#13;
physical progress being made under the sub-project. Once approved by NCDDR staff these&#13;
financial reports will be submitted to the FMPU where expenditures will be checked for&#13;
eligibility, and subsequent payments made based the sub-project budget, current expenditure&#13;
category balances, and the disbursement schedule. The FMPU will retain all financial records&#13;
associated with the TEP supported activities and would therefore be the focus of both donor&#13;
supervision mission review and semi-annual Project audits. As a part of the Project audit,&#13;
a random sampling of implementing agency sub-projects will be reviewed in detail to assess&#13;
adherence to both the financial management and contractual obligations under the TEP.&#13;
12.49 The standard procedures for procurement, monitoring, financial and technical progress&#13;
reporting for implementing agencies under the TEP are similar to those required under the ERSF.&#13;
Specialized Delivery Procedures under the ERSF&#13;
12.50 Public Works Social Safety Nd. A social safety net program that uses labor-intensive&#13;
public works activities to create temporary employment among vulnerable groups of ex-&#13;
combatants, unemployed urban youth, newly retuming rural communities, and others such as&#13;
female-headed households will be implemented as a distinct component under the ERSF. An&#13;
outline of the key issues to be considered in targeting and implementing this component is&#13;
presented in Attachment 13.&#13;
12.51 After consideration of alternative options, the Government and the World Bank&#13;
concluded that the ERSF sub-project review and approval procedures should be used for this&#13;
element of the Project. The same staff and organizational sucures are capable of handling these&#13;
types of projects, and the inter-agency review process will help guarantee both technical&#13;
suitability of sub-projects and coordination with other similar activities (such as food for work or&#13;
food for agriculture projects). The recent revisions to the institutional structure of NCRRR that&#13;
include adding a Western Area office and seeking civil engineers for district level posts, will&#13;
facilitate the inclusion of public works sub-project proposals in the review process. Specific&#13;
technical criteria will be incorporated into the Project's Operational Manual and be used in&#13;
reviewing and assessing these types of public works activities. Based on World Bank best&#13;
practices for similar programs, the suggested criteria are as follows:&#13;
* public works projects should create temporary employment among the most vulnerable,&#13;
while at the same time optimize the social, economic and/or physical infrastructure of the&#13;
community;, ideally, being oriented toward funther job creation and/or income&#13;
generation;&#13;
* geographic targeting of projects to help ensure greatest participation of poorest; therefore,&#13;
urban projects should be in those areas where there is general agreement that the poorest&#13;
live (e.g.,., Goderich, Congo Town, Dworzak Farm, Kroobay, Ginger Hall, and large&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

parts of Kissy and Wellington, etc., for Freetown) and for recently returned communities&#13;
(within last 12 months) for rural areas and projects;&#13;
* project wage rate not to exceed the prevailing market wage for unskilled labor. For&#13;
example, in mid-1998, the average daily wage rate for unskilled labor was approximately&#13;
Le 1,500, or US$1 per day;&#13;
* the total wage component for unskilled labor of the public works project should, on&#13;
average, be equal to or exceed 50 percent of the total project cost;&#13;
* depending on the type of public works and the location, wages could be paid in both cash&#13;
and in-kind (eg, food), however, the total value should not exceed a daily wage rate of&#13;
Le. 1,500 as discussed above (per discussions between SLRA and NGOs suggest that for&#13;
the implementation of all food-aid projects, 30% of the labor cost shall be paid in food&#13;
and 70% in cash);&#13;
* projects should encourage linkages between work and productivity through incorporating&#13;
a piece-rate or task-based payment system for laborers. (for instances, SLRA's Feeder&#13;
Roads Department has established wage rates per man-day for 18 different road&#13;
rehabilitation activities);&#13;
* projects need to be consistent with existing labor laws;&#13;
* projects need to be technically feasible and proposals must demonstrate that appropriate&#13;
technical norms and design standards wil be adhered to;&#13;
* guarantee of community participation in project design, execution, and maintenance to&#13;
ensure long-term sustainability;&#13;
* timing and design of services/works should, to the extent possible, encourage broadest&#13;
participation and reduce opportumty costs of participation through seasonal timing&#13;
(i.e., not during the planting or harvesting seasons) and flexible working arrangements&#13;
(such as piece meal rates).&#13;
* numnber of laborers at any one-job site should range between 50 and 75, and not exceed&#13;
100.&#13;
12.52 Pmbfic Sector Instiutions. The technical departments, regional, and district offices of&#13;
the line ministries of the GOSL have an important role to fulfill in the implementation of the&#13;
ERSF. First, relevant line ministries (i.e., health, education, agriculture, works, etc.) are al&#13;
potential implementing partners to the ERSF. NCRRR fully expects that the appropriate&#13;
technical units and offices of these ministries will be active participants in the development and&#13;
implementation of sub-projects. Secondly, the technical ministries will play a critical role at the&#13;
regional level in providing guidance and input to the ERSF project staff and Projects Committee.&#13;
NCRRR recognizes the technical expertise and responsibility that the line ministries have in&#13;
guaranteeing adherence to sectoral standards and norms. Therefore, technical sub-committees at&#13;
the regional level will be called upon to provide specialized knowledge and advice on given sub-&#13;
project proposals. The senior technical officer from the relevant line ministry or parastatal&#13;
agency will be the contact person for the NCRRR in order to coordinate appropriate technical&#13;
reviews of ERSF sub-project proposals. NCRRR will make available to sub-committee members&#13;
or specified technical personnel in the regions adequate logistical support to facilitate these&#13;
technical reviews of proposals. Finally, NCRRR will rely on the line ministry departments to&#13;
help monitor sub-project implementation-- especially regarding technical specifications and&#13;
norms. District level NCRRR staff responsible for monitoring ERSF sub-project implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitatfion&#13;

will be responsible for securing the close coordination of line ministry personnel at the same level&#13;
when specific technical matters of project implementation are being considered.&#13;
12.53 Given the special nature of the line ministry departments as the coordinator of all national&#13;
activities for their respective sectors, and as the regulatng body in terms of technical norms and&#13;
procedures, the process whereby the line ministries apply to and are financed under the ERSF will&#13;
vary slightly. First any project submitted by a district or regional line ministry office must be&#13;
endorsed by the appropriate central ministry department. Second, in the event of a national level&#13;
project activity (such as for an information campaign, staff traioing etc.), the proposal to the&#13;
ERSF would be submitted direy to NCRRR at the central level, and would be reviewed by the&#13;
National ERSF Projects Committee. Third, fund disbursement for activities implemented through&#13;
line ministry departments would have to be consistent with the financial management&#13;
requirements of the Government, as well as abide by the procedures of the FMPU.&#13;

13. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
13.1  The CRRP has two principal components, namely: (i) an Emergency Recovery Support&#13;
Fund (ERSF), and related institutional support to NCRRR and partners; and (ii) a Training and&#13;
Employment Program (TEP), and related institutional support to NCDDR. Both components will&#13;
finance sub-project activities through a social fundtype mechanism. The ERSF is designed to&#13;
finance demand-driven community based sub-projects, while the TEP is designed to finance the&#13;
social and economic reintegration of former combatants. The Government initiated the CRRP in&#13;
1997 with funding from the Project Preparation Facility. The objective of the Project is to&#13;
stimulate economic recovery by expediting the reintegration of internally displaced persons, ex-&#13;
combatants and refugees and restoring the provision of basic social services.&#13;
Analysis of Alternatives&#13;
13.2  The Project has been developed by the key stakeholders in a participatory manner. As&#13;
the Government's implementation capacity has been weakened considerably in the course of the&#13;
conflict, it was considered advisable for the Project to put greater emphasis on implementation&#13;
through existing structures and capacities of partner organizaions: i.e. NGOs, existing project&#13;
units and, where feasible, line ministries. During the emergency period, Government has&#13;
successfully developed effective coordination mechanisms at national and regional level that will&#13;
be used to mobilize these implementing partners to better ensure effective coordination.&#13;
Atetive Project implementation strategies considered included implementation via line&#13;
ministries or through the exclusive use of technical assistance. Both options were rejected; the&#13;
first because of capacity constraints and the second due to concerns regarding ownership,&#13;
community participation, and sustanability.&#13;
13.3  The capacity of the implementing parters, in particular NGOs, to deliver services has&#13;
been analyzed using a number of proxy indicators such as the number of organizations, the time&#13;
they have been operatig in country, their sectoral and geographic areas of operation, and their&#13;
highest recorded annual program value in the lst five years. Sierra Leone has had a well&#13;
established community of developmental NGOs which has further expanded in response to the&#13;
war-related breakdown in government capacity. About 71 percent of development organizations&#13;
operating today have started to work after 1990.&#13;
13.4  The implementation capacity of international NGOs by far exceeds the capacity of&#13;
national NGOs, taking the highest annual program value during the Lst five years as an indcator.&#13;
International NGOs have an annual turnover of about US$80 million, while the program value of&#13;
national NGOs amounts to only US$5.4 million.16 The CRRP will provide institutional support&#13;
to national NGOs to enhance their capacity to plan and implement sub-projects.&#13;

Sustainability and Fiscal Impact&#13;
13.5   The CRRP places the maintenance of social infiatructure in the hands of communities&#13;
and line ministries. They hold responsibility for upkeep of structures and staffing in line with&#13;
Government regulations and sub-project design. The risk of unsustainable project activities&#13;
therefore depends on the type of sub-project and the participation of the beneficiary community;&#13;
both issues are to be assessed at time of sub-project evaluation. Systems and procedures have&#13;
been developed in the Project's Operational Manual, and training of NCRRR and NCDDR staff&#13;
has been camed out, to ensure that sub-ptojects with a low probability of sustainability would not&#13;
be undertaken, and that communities and implemnenting agencies with a poor track record be&#13;
denied additional sub-projects funding.&#13;
13.6   Although studies of the impact of community participation on sustainability in Sierra&#13;
Leone do not exist, empirical evidence from similar operations in the Africa Region points to a&#13;
strong, positive correlation between community participation and sustainability of projects.&#13;
Given the low rural wage rate, use of appropriate technologies, and high output increases,&#13;
investments in these types of sub-projects also show high rates of returns.&#13;
13.7   The non-quantifiable benefits and positive externalities to communities resulting from&#13;
improved basic social and economic infrastructure are substantial and justify public intervention.&#13;
The benefits would include improved agricultural production leading to improved food security&#13;
and nutritional status of the household, and possibly an increase in household income; safer&#13;
drinking water leading to reduction in incidence of water-bome diseases and lost labor&#13;
productivity; reduction in drudgery and transaction costs due to the rehabilitation of roads, small&#13;
bridges and culverts; and improved health and well-being from the rehabilitation of health&#13;
services.&#13;
13.8   The Government's counterpart contribution to the Project has been kept to a minimum.&#13;
Fuzthennore, due to the emergency nature of the project, no mandatory co-financing requirement&#13;
has been placed on the communities. However, it is assumed that depending on the nature of the&#13;
sub-project and circumstances, many communities will contribute in kind either through labor or&#13;
goods. Therefore, it has been agreed with Govemment that, at a minimum, 10 percent of the total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

sub-project costs will be borne by either, or a combination ot the Govermment, the implementing&#13;
agencies, and the beneficiaries.&#13;
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis&#13;
13.9  Interventions under the CRRP will support rehabilitation of basic social and economic&#13;
infiastructure, to minimum standards sufficient to permit households and communities to&#13;
reestablish themselves. Civil works will largely be small-scale and rehabilitation rather than new&#13;
construction, using mainly local materials and labor-intensive techniques. Because of the&#13;
demand-driven nature of the project and the variation in conditions in target areas, it is difficult to&#13;
determine, a priori, the exact composition of the Projects portfolio. From the point of view of&#13;
cost-effectiveness the Project is, however, designed to minimize costs without giving up much&#13;
ground in terms of quality. Stringent cost and quality conscious procedures were followed in the&#13;
identification and design of the Project. Sub-projects will be selected on a competitive and cost-&#13;
effective basis.&#13;
13.10 An important economic rationale for investing in the economic recovery and&#13;
reintegration of Sierra Leone is the extremely high opportunity cost in terms of growth foregone.&#13;
Not investing in rehabilitation of basic social and economic infastructure, not enabling conflict&#13;
affected communities to reintegrate reurning households and individuals, and not laying a basis&#13;
for restoring local economies would retain Sierra Leone in a social, economic, institutional and&#13;
logistical bind that would seriously hamper its economic growth prospects.&#13;
13.11 The demand driven nature ofthe sub-projects also prevents a quantitatively reliable cost-&#13;
benefit analysis of the overall project. The direct costs of the project are around US$25 million,&#13;
however, the direct and indirect benefits cannot be quantified in monetary terms at this time.&#13;
Nonetheless, an analysis of illustrative sub-project types and an extrapolation of sub-projects that&#13;
have already been submitted under the pilot phase are instructive as to the potential economic&#13;
benefits of the Project.&#13;
13.12 Analysis of Sub-projects. The CRRP would support the Government's efforts to&#13;
stabilize the economy through priority investments in economic and social inastructure in&#13;
communities devastated as a result of the civil war. The emergency nature of the proposed&#13;
operation and the demand driven nature of individual sub-projects impose certain restrictions on&#13;
the conduct of a full economic analysis of the overall project. However, the approach adopted by&#13;
the NCRRR and NCDDR is to evaluate the viability of individual sub-projects that would be&#13;
proposed by beneficiary communities and groups. A simple, standardized fiamework in the form&#13;
of a matrix has been developed to help NCRRR and NCDDR staff examine the economic&#13;
viability of sub-projects. Issues considered include: (i) the validity of the project's objective;&#13;
(ii) analysis of alternatives; (iii) cost-effectiveness; (iv) fiscal impact and financial sustainability;&#13;
and (v) environmental impact. Throughout the Project, indicators will be used to assess&#13;
individual sub-project and overall Project performance and impact.  During the initial&#13;
implementation phase a management tool will be developed to link the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
process closer to cost-effectiveness and/or cost-benefit evaluation techniques. Provision has been&#13;
made for a more detailed economic analysis of sub-projects prior to the mid-term review.&#13;
13.13 Poverty and Sdf-targedng of Sub-projects. The latest poverty profile for Sierra Leone is&#13;
based on the 1989/90 Survey of Household Expenditures and Household Economic Activities.&#13;
The Survey offers a useful baseline regarding poverty, however, it is based on data collected prior&#13;
to the outbreak of the civil conflict. Social indicators describe very harsh living conditions: life&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
TechnicalAnnex                       Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;
County: Sierra Leone                                                    Page 80 of 87&#13;
expectancy averages around 42 years, infant mortality is among the world's highest at&#13;
147 deaths/1,000 live births, the literacy rate is estimated at only 20 percent and primary school&#13;
enrollment at about 35 percent.&#13;
13.14 According to the poverty profile, 81.6 percent of the population are poor, using the&#13;
intermational standard of US$1.00 daily per capita expenditures, an d 61.2 percent live in "core'&#13;
poverty, based on the standard of USS 0.50 daily per capita expenditures. Income distribution is&#13;
generally very unequal, with a Gini Coefficient of 0.63 at the national level, and is even more&#13;
unequal in rural areas. Poverty is predominantly a nural phenomenon - 57 percent of the poor&#13;
live in rural areas. Furthermore, the depth of poverty is much greater in rural areas, indicating&#13;
that a larger number of the rural poor live under the core poverty line.&#13;
13.15 As a consequence of the destruction brought by the civil war and military junta and post-&#13;
junta period, it is estimated that poverty has become even more severe. The 1989/90 household&#13;
survey indiates that the efforts of the CRRP should largely be directed towards the rural areas,&#13;
giving high priority to food security and nutrition, and the delivery of social services. It is&#13;
expected that the CRRP will respond appropriately to these poverty reduction priorities given the&#13;
decentralized and demand driven nature of the Project and the fact that sub-project proposals are&#13;
largely developed by, or in close cooperation with, communities. This planning hypothesis has&#13;
been borne out in the PPF-financed pilot phase of the ERSF, where the majority of the submitted&#13;
sub-projects target agricultural rehabilitation (58 percent), social services provision (14 percent),&#13;
infastructure (9 percent). The remaining projects were of a capacity building (8 percent) or&#13;
multi-sectoral nature (11 percent). It is expected that, in line with the stabilization of the&#13;
situation, the focus of the CRRP will shift from food security to the rehabilitation of social and&#13;
economic infastrucure.&#13;

14. IMPLEMENTATION PLANS AND MONITORING&#13;
INDICATORS&#13;
Implementstion Plans&#13;
14.1  The Project will be implemented by NCRRR and the Executive Secretariat of NCDDR.&#13;
The CRRP is integrated into the national programs that these two GOSL agencies will implement,&#13;
namely the NRRRP and the DDR Program, respectively. The DDR Program specifically targets&#13;
ex-combatants and provides for their special needs during a transition period until they can&#13;
participate on par with other civilians in the broad-based national program, i.e. the NRRRP. Both&#13;
national programs will be implemented through central level units, regional and, in the case of&#13;
NCRRR, district offices described in the previous Sections of this Technical Annex. These&#13;
technical units and offices have prepared detailed semi-annual work plans that have been used to&#13;
estimated the critical input requirements of the NCRRR and NCDDR under the Project as well as&#13;
for other funding sources.&#13;
14.2  The implementation plans, which cover the period from October 1999 to March 2000, are&#13;
shown in Attachment 8. This first six month period of Project implementation is partly financed&#13;
hrough the PPF and focuses on: (i) fully operationalizing the national and regional offices of&#13;
NCRRR and NCDDR (including hiring staf equipping, furnishing, and establishing systems and&#13;
procedures for Project implementation); (ii) expanding on the financing and monitoring of&#13;
activities under the ERSF and TEP; (ni) developing and disseminating sensitization materials and&#13;
messages; and (iv) contracting and mobilizing key technical assistance including that for the&#13;
FMPU, ERSF implementation, social and economic reintegration, and Project monitoring and&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
14.3  This six-month planning time fiame was considered appropriate for the CRRP due to the&#13;
shorter overall time frame of the Project, the emergency nature of the activities, and the dynamic&#13;
and rapidly changing environment in which the Project is operating. The Government will&#13;
review and update these plans every six months to coincide with the Bank's semi-annual&#13;
supervision missions. Regional office and central unit staff of NCDDR and NCRRR will have&#13;
responsibility for preparing detailed semi-annual plans that will be consolidated at national level&#13;
and used to monitor progress in implementing the Project. The preparation of these plans will be&#13;
timed to coincide with semi-annual supervision missions.&#13;
14.4  At operational levels, the DDR and RRR Programs are subject to different factors that&#13;
influence the chosen approach to implementation. Pertinent considerations are sunmnaized&#13;
below.&#13;
The ARRRP&#13;
14.5 The NRRRP focuses on resettling internally displaced people and refugees resulting from&#13;
eight years of conflict, reviving basic social services and economic activity in the conmunuites&#13;
affected by the war, and rebuilding social capital through reintegration and reconciliation. Project&#13;
support of the NRRRP focuses on financing of the ERSF and related institutional support to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

NCRRR and implementing partners. Institutional support to NCRRR pnncipally will take the&#13;
form of the provision of required goods and equipment, technical assistance, staff and other&#13;
operating cost inputs. With the exception of on-going operating costs, most of these inputs will&#13;
be provided within the first nine months of Project implementation. It is expected that&#13;
institutional support to national implementing partners will be provided during the first 12 to&#13;
18 months of Project implementation.&#13;
14.6   Under the ERSF, sub-project implementation plans will be developed by implementing&#13;
partners as a requirement of the sub-project proposal process. Given the demand nature of the&#13;
Fund, these plans can not, a pnon, be specified but rather will vary depending on the type of&#13;
activity and implementing agency involved. Each such plan, and its related budget and&#13;
performance monitoring indicators, will become part of the contract that the Government will&#13;
enter into with the implementing partners. Reviewing, approving and monitoring of sub-project&#13;
activities will represent the majority of the regional and national NCRRR implementation plans.&#13;
This work is currently being piloted under the PPF.&#13;
7he NDDRP&#13;
14.7 The DDR Program will be implemented in phases between July 1998 and January 2001.&#13;
In totaL Phase I will target up to 13,000 ex-combatants consisting of 8,000 detained AFSL and&#13;
RUF combatants and 5,000 members of the CDF. Child combatants and disabled combatants&#13;
would be targeted for inclusion in Phase I. Phases II and Im would target 10,000 CDF&#13;
combatants each, as well as an undetermined number of RUF combatants'7.&#13;
14.8  Phase I was initiated in July 1998 with the opening of the Lungi Demobilization Center&#13;
(LDC) and the screening and registration of approximately 3,000 ex-combatants, however,&#13;
activities were suspended in late December 1998, and the LDC closed, in response to an&#13;
escalation of hostilities in-country and deterioration in the security situation. After a hiatus of&#13;
approximately four months following the attack on Freetown, the Program has been restartd and&#13;
the Lungi Center reopened. The government, with the support of key stakeholders that include&#13;
ECOMOG, UNOMSIL, the Office of the Special Envoy, and DFID-financed technical assistance,&#13;
have moved ahead with the critical activities called for under the Lome Agreement. The DDR&#13;
Program was formally launched on October 20di, 1999, and the Government is set to open four&#13;
additional Demobilization Centers in later October so that combatants who have presented&#13;
themselves and their weapons to UNOMSIL and ECOMOG at associated reception centers can&#13;
begin the DDR process.&#13;
14.9  Based on the Joint Operational Plan  for Disarmament and Demobilization&#13;
(August 24, 1999) and subsequent planning documents of the DDR Program, it is expected that&#13;
the discharge of all ex-combatants handled under Phase I would be completed by May, 2000.&#13;
The relevant plans for Phase I activities are shown in Attachment 9. Detailed planning for the&#13;
subsequent phases of the DDR Program will be a critical activity under Phase I.&#13;

CRRP Performance Monitoring&#13;
14.10 Performance monitoring of the CRRP will build on the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
activities of NCRRR and NCDDR, as well as on independent assessments. These will focus on&#13;
two levels: first, at overall program level for the NRRRP and the NDDRP (development&#13;
objectives, outcomes and core assumptions and preconditions), and second, at detailed project&#13;
(i.e., CRRP) component and activity level (outputs, implementation, managerial efficiency,&#13;
detailed program assumptions). A Logical Framework summary matrix (Project Summary Table)&#13;
is presented in Attachment 3, which includes a list of performance indicators for program&#13;
objectives and outcomes, and CRRP outputs and inputs, as well as, core assumptions and related&#13;
risks. These indicators will be used to measure the performance of the NDDRP and NRRRP, as&#13;
well as the CRRP. For each program and Project component, similar but more detailed matrices&#13;
will be developed and fed in to the overall M&amp;E System.&#13;
National Program Level Monitoring: Devdopment Objectives and Related&#13;
Assumpdons and Risks&#13;
14.11 The development objective for the NDDRP is the "consolidation of the national security&#13;
situation and social stability in Sierra Leone", and for the NRRRP it is the "social and economic&#13;
revival of war-affected communities". Overall program monitoring will seek to provide policy&#13;
level decision makers with adequate information and analysis in regards to these broad objectives&#13;
of the two national programs. Specifically, the focus for the NDDRP would be on the broader&#13;
program impact on the security situation in the country and on the impact of successful&#13;
demobilization on the promotion of social stability. Program monitoring of the NRRRP will focus&#13;
on the reintegration of target groups and the revival of social and economic activities at&#13;
community level. The main mechanisms used for this level of monitoring will be regular joint&#13;
multi-donor reviews, regular meetings of the NCDDR and of NCRRR's Inter-Ministerial Steering&#13;
Committee, supplemented with project specific or national survey data that is independent of the&#13;
day-to-day operations of the two institutions responsible for overseeing the implementation of the&#13;
national programs and the CRRP.&#13;
Conponent and Activiy Level Monitoring&#13;
14.12 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Systems will be designed and set-up at the NCRRR&#13;
and the Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR. The two systems will be developed using the same&#13;
software platform, and be compatible in terms of coding of basic data. Thus it will be possible to&#13;
follow ex-combatants from the targeted program (i.e., the NDDRP) to the broad-based program&#13;
(i.e., NRRRP). (See also the section on 'Design Principles' below).&#13;
14.13 The M&amp;E system of NCRRR will allow the Commission to (i) analyze the effectiveness&#13;
of the ERSF review process; (ii) quantify sub-project outputs by sector, by region, and by&#13;
beneficiary type - including ex-combatants - and gender; (iii) assess level and quality of&#13;
community and local institutional participation in sub-project design and implementation; and&#13;
(iv) measure the impact of assistance in terms of increased agricultural production, expansion of&#13;
social services, increased economic activity, and strengthening of community institutions.&#13;
14.14 The M&amp;E system of the NCDDR will enable the Executive Secretariat to, among others:&#13;
(i) establish detailed, gender desegregated, socioeconomic baselines/profiles; (ii) trace overtime&#13;
participation of individual ex-combatants in the DDRP (reception of assistance package,&#13;
&#13;

palticipation orientation, training and reintegration activities); (iii) assess implementation&#13;
efficiency; (iv) assess the level of social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants.&#13;
14.15 Given the innovative nature of the CRRP's delivery mechanisms (namely the ERSF and&#13;
the TEP), and the fact tbat the Government's executing insfitutions (namely NCRRR and&#13;
NCDDR) are newly established organizations, the Bank will also be concemed with that data&#13;
which indicates if the systems and institutions have been established and are operating efficiently.&#13;
Therefore, the Bank will monitor how quickly the respective institutions finalize the hiring of key&#13;
Project staff, and operationalize the respective central and regional offices, and sub-project&#13;
review committees. Timely submission of all Project related reports (quarterly statements of&#13;
accounts, quarterly progress reports, and semi-annual audit reports) will also serve as a measure&#13;
of institutional capacity. The Bank also will monitor closely the effective operation of the&#13;
FMPU, based on the quarterly consultancy reports to be provided by the contracted firm; the&#13;
timeliness and accuracy of SOE's, payment requests, and other applications and withdrawals; and&#13;
the quality of procurement documentation submitted to IDA for non-objection.&#13;
Main focus for monitoring&#13;
14.16 The performance indicators presented in program and Project summary matrices are&#13;
measures that will enable the respective levels of management to closely follow pertinent issues&#13;
related the efficiency, effect and impact of the national programs and the CRRP. Table 14-1 on&#13;
the following page indicates the monitoring levels discussed in the preceding paragraphs, related&#13;
areas of focus, and means of data collection for NRRRP, NDDRP, and CRRP performance&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
Monitoring Responsibilities and Reporting&#13;
14.17 NRRRP. The Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) of NCRRR&#13;
will have overall responsibility for monitoring and preparing quarterly progress reports on the&#13;
implementation of the NRRRP and those elements of the CRRP for which the Commission is&#13;
responsible. The national level Program Manager for M&amp;E, and the regional ERSF Projects&#13;
Officers will take day-to-day responsibility for ensuring that data is collected and entered into the&#13;
M&amp;E system and analyzed. In particular, these staff will be responsible for standardizing the&#13;
monitoring indicators and data collection formats, assisting implementing partners to develop&#13;
monitoring plans for each sub-project, and compiling sub-project data for overall Project progress&#13;
review and assessment of performance. The Director of DPME will be responsible for preparing&#13;
the quarterly progress reports that will contain consolidated information on NRRRP and Project&#13;
performance. Implementing partners will provide NCRRR with monthly physical and financial&#13;
progress reports on ERSF sub-project implementation.&#13;
14.18 NDDRP. The Executive Secretary of NCDDR is responsible for the preparation of&#13;
quarterly progress reports on the targets and timeframes set in the NDDRP and the CRRP&#13;
implementation plans. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Executive Secretariat will:&#13;
(i) design formats and questionnaires to capture socioeconomic and adminisaive information&#13;
and ensure that these sets of information are consistenly entered in the DDRP database;&#13;
(ii) maintain and continuously up date the program's M&amp;E database (iii) analyze the data, prepare&#13;
cross tabulations and summaries as per the instructions of the Executive Secretary; (iv) compile&#13;
data for program Progress reports; (v) prepare Socioeconomic Profile and Monitoring Reports.&#13;

14.19 The analysis of quantitative socioeconomic and administation related data will be&#13;
supplemented by mainly qualitative Beneficiary Assessments. These will be commissioned by&#13;
the Executive Secretariat and implemented by independent consultants. In addition, independent&#13;
interim evaluations will be commissioned after each Phase of DDRP implementation. Interim&#13;
Evaluation Reports will be available for joint donor reviews/supervision mission.&#13;

formats for questionnaires, administrative forms, overview reports; (iii) a database documented in&#13;
a Data Dictionary; and (iv) regular and ad hoc reports for senior management of the DDRP and&#13;
NCRRR&#13;
14.23 M&amp;E data collection procedures should ensure that data collection is comprehensive as&#13;
well as cost effective. Typically this implies that data collection must take place in conjunction&#13;
with 'administrative occasions'.  For example, the first socioeconomic questionnaire for the&#13;

DDRP is administered when ex-combatants are given their NCDDR Identification Cards. A&#13;
follow up survey will be in conjunction with any occasion that involves all ex-combatants, such&#13;
as for example, the payment of the second installment of the reinsertion package. NCRRR will&#13;
collect relevant baseline data on implementing partner agencies at the same time that each&#13;
organization submits a proposal to the ERSF.&#13;
14.24 As was indicated in previous sections, the set up of the M&amp;E Systems for the Project and&#13;
the respective national programs is a work in progress and is being supported under the PPF&#13;
advance through technical assistance. The following design principles will be followed in the&#13;
development and implementation of the system.&#13;
For the NDDRP&#13;
1.   A comprehensive socioeconomic baseline (including a skills assessment and intended&#13;
economic activity) will be established for all ex-combatants.&#13;
2.    Follow-up on socio-economic developments (reintegration) will be done in conjunction&#13;
with those administative occasions (mainly payments) that involve all ex-combatants.&#13;
3.    Subsets of information will be collected in conjunction with the implementation of&#13;
activities not necessarily involving all ex-combatants (training, participation in RRR&#13;
financed projects, special projects for disabled persons or child ex-combatants).&#13;
4.    To manage and store the data, the Executive Secretariat will maintain, and where relevant&#13;
expand, a relational database using the NCDDR Administive Number of the ex-&#13;
combatants as the key identifying field.&#13;
5.   The Monitoring Unit of the Executive Secretariat will at technical level liaise with&#13;
collaborating organizations and institutions to ensure th-at data sets on ex-combatants can&#13;
be linked across the databases used by these institutions. Thus, collaborating institutions&#13;
such as NCRRR and UNICEF should add the NCDDR Administrative Number to their&#13;
respective data sets.&#13;
For the NRRRP&#13;
1.   Where one does not already exist, a baseline will be established for each sub-project as&#13;
part of the preliminary sub-project activities.&#13;
2.   Implementing partners will provide essential Project output information to NCRRR as part&#13;
of their monthly progress reporting requirements, this data will be periodically verified by&#13;
NCRRR staff through site visits.&#13;
3.    Measuring the impact of Project activities on the overall development objectives of the&#13;
NRRRP will be the responsibility of independent outside evaluators and would draw on&#13;
data available from relevant line ministries and NGOs.&#13;

TORS: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND PROCUREMENT&#13;
UNIT (DRAFT)&#13;
Background&#13;
Subsequent to the restoration of democracy and the revival of recovery efforts following more than&#13;
seven years of civil war and unrest, the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) is embarking on an&#13;
ambitious program of activities for national recovery and reintegration that will be supported by the&#13;
World Bank, the African Development Bank, the UK Department for International Development,&#13;
and other donor organizations. The National Programmes for: (i) Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and&#13;
Resettlement (RRR) and for (ii) Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) will&#13;
facilitate and finance reintegration support for ex-combatants and resettlement of refugees and&#13;
displaced people, rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure, local institutional capacity&#13;
building and reconciliation assistance.&#13;
Two institutions will be the principal executing agencies under the World Bank, AfDB and other&#13;
donor supported projects: the National Commission for Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and&#13;
Resettlement (NCRRR) and the National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization, and&#13;
Reintegration (NCDDR). Both agencies are newly established and are temporary institutions that&#13;
will serve for a finite period of time to set the overall policy for the national programmes; ensure&#13;
adequate and appropriate coordination among and between relevant governmental, non-&#13;
governmental, and donor partners; and monitor implementation of specific sub-project activities.&#13;
Partner organizations including local and international non-governmental organizations, community&#13;
based organizations, UN agencies, line ministry departments, and private business will take principal&#13;
responsibility for the implementation of the project as sub-contractors.&#13;
The NCRRR will seek to facilitate national reconstruction activities through a demand driven social-&#13;
fund type financing mechanism (the Emergency Recovery Support Fund-- ERSF) that will support&#13;
community based sub-projects aimed at restoring economic and social infrastructure, promoting&#13;
reconciliation, and strengthening local institutions. Appropriate sub-projects will be identified by&#13;
war-affected populations and communities and designed and implemented in collaboration with&#13;
local and international NGOs, line ministries and other partners active and experienced in the&#13;
geographic and sectoral areas of concern. NCRRR, working through district-level officers, regional&#13;
offices, and inter-agency committees, will review and approve sub-project proposals, enter into&#13;
contract agreements with various implementing partners, and monitor the physical and financial&#13;
progress of sub-project implementation.&#13;
The NCDDR will oversee the GOSL commitment and efforts to completly disarm, demobilise and&#13;
reintegrate (i) an estimated 8,000 combatants of the Armed Forces of Sierra Leone (AFSL) and the&#13;
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) currently under Government control and (ii) an estimated 25,000&#13;
combatants of the Civil Defence Forces (CDF). The primary objectives are the consolidation of&#13;
security and the sustainable social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants. The disarmament,&#13;
&#13;

Sierra Leone                                                   Attachment 5: Page 2 of 15&#13;
demobilisation and reintegration programme if implemented in a transparent and equitable manner,&#13;
could serve as an important pull factor for those combatants still holding out in the bush, provided a&#13;
conductive security environment is promoted. The Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR would be&#13;
responsible for ensuring: (i) the planning and implementation of the individual programme&#13;
components in collaboration with other government departments, NGOs and donors; (ii) the&#13;
transparent and accountable administration of the programme; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
An important financial and management control aspect of the DDR Programme will be the payment&#13;
of reintegration allowances to all ex-combatants noted above, and contracting and support for a&#13;
training and employment fund.&#13;
NCRRR and NCDDR are new institutions with limited experience administering donor-financed&#13;
project activities. In addition, the Government recognizes the need for the highest degree of&#13;
transparency and accountability in the operation and administration of the national programmes to:&#13;
(i) satisfy the requirements of donor agencies considering financial support to the GOSL efforts;&#13;
(ii) encourage implementing partners to continue collaborating with the Commission and the&#13;
Committee in the national recovery and reintegration process; and (iii) to reassure the public in&#13;
general as to the seriousness and commitment of the Government in redressing the damage and&#13;
causes of the civil war. Therefore, the GOSL intends to seek local and international technical&#13;
expertise to implement the financial management and procurement responsibilities for the&#13;
Emergency Recovery Support Fund and other donor-financed activities and support to the NCRRR&#13;
and NCDDR. Proposals will be sought from a short-list of qualified local and international firms.&#13;
The successful bidder will set-up and manage the Financial Management and Procurement Unit&#13;
(FMPU). This unit will have responsibility for all financial management functions, contracting, and&#13;
procurement procedures on behalf of the NCRRR and NCDDR. All costs associated with setting up&#13;
and operating the FMPU will be defined by the bidders and should be included in the Financial&#13;
Proposal. The bidders will have complete responsibility for identifying and hiring all local and&#13;
international staff deemed necessary to fulfil the responsibilities of the FMPU. The unit will be&#13;
managed by a qualified and experienced senior professional with experience in the design and&#13;
implementation of an appropriate financial management and internal control system for the Project&#13;
and Programme of this nature. Additional staff of accountants and other professionals will be&#13;
required as necessary to assist with disbursement, accounting, expenditure reviews, internal control&#13;
and project and sub-project procurement issues. An illustrative list of professional staff for the&#13;
FMPU is presented in these TORs, however the specific staffing arrangements for the unit are at the&#13;
discretion of the consultant firm bidding on these services.&#13;
The remaining pages outline in greater detail the terms of reference for the Financial Management&#13;
and Procurement Unit; required qualifications of manditory and recommended staff; and the timing,&#13;
duration, and duty post for the unit's staff.&#13;
1.    Overall Responsibilities&#13;

17. Assist NCRRRlNCDDR in other areas related to their financial management, contracting&#13;
and procurement responsibilities under the NRRRP.&#13;
2.    Reporting Responsibilities&#13;
The Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) will be an autonomous body that&#13;
provides service for, and reports to, the National Commission for Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and&#13;
Resettlement, and to the National Committee on Disarnament, Demobilisation and Reintegration.&#13;
The FMPU will ensure that all contracting, procurement, disbursement and financial management&#13;
functions required under the two national programmes are carried out in accordance with standard&#13;
and accepted guidelines of the donor agencies supporting these two programmes. The Unit Manager&#13;
of the FMPU will report to the Commissioner of NCRRR and the Executive Secretary of NCDDR,&#13;
respectively, for the different monies provided to the GOSL for the respective programmes. The&#13;
FMPU will assist both NCRRR and NCDDR prepare all financial management reports, payment&#13;
requests, and other financial documentation required of the Commission and Committee by the&#13;
GOSL and donor agencies.&#13;
The FMPU will be responsible for the following reports:&#13;
1. Monthly Contract Expenditure Report (expenses by negotiated line item for reporting&#13;
period, year-to-date, and total-to-date; remaining balance by line item; and status of&#13;
advance payments);&#13;
2. Quarterly Contract Progress Report (work planned, carried out, accomplishments,&#13;
constraints, and planned activities for subsequent quarter);&#13;
3. Quarterly Donor Commitment Report (total expenses and commitments by donor and&#13;
cost category for reporting period, year-to-date, and total-to-date); and&#13;
4. Additional operational manuals, procedural guidelines, and ad hoc reports as reasonably&#13;
requested by the NCRRR and NCDDR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3.    Resources Management Responsibilities&#13;
It is estimated that the FMPU will have responsibility for overseeing the management of up to&#13;
US$50 million, however, currently proposed resources amount to around US$30 million. Of this&#13;
total, approximately $25 million will finance sub-projects implemented by partner organisations&#13;
active in the areas of resettlement, reconstruction, rehabilitation, training, etc. These activities will&#13;
be funded through sub-contract arrangements (ranging from $10,000 to $500,000 in value) for which&#13;
the FMPU will have financial monitoring responsibility. Implementing partners may be non-&#13;
governmental organisations, line ministry units, or community based organisations currently active&#13;
in Sierra Leone. The proposed financial mechanisms for the disbursement and control of funds&#13;
through these sub-contracts is discussed in detail in the attached document Operational Manualfor&#13;
the Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF). The remaining $5 million will go toward&#13;
institutional support of the NCRRR and NCDDR; including the purchase of goods, equipment,&#13;
vehicles, technical assistance, and the payment of operating costs-- for which the FMPU will have&#13;
some responsibility for assisting with the procurement, disbursement and financial management.&#13;
In addition, it is expected that the FMPU will manage the mechanism for disbursing reintegration&#13;
payments to ex-combatants (to be done in either one or two payments, and either at central pre-&#13;
discharge centres, or in a limited number of regional centres or designated locations). It is currently&#13;
estimated that approximately 35,000 ex-combatants will receive some form of cash payment, a&#13;
control system for which will have to be developed by the FMPU. More specific details of the&#13;
proposed cash transfer arrangements for ex-combatants is provided in the attached document on the&#13;
Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Program.&#13;
The successful proposal must take into consideration the challenges posed by the current situation in&#13;
Sierra Leone and present a realistic approach to the issues raised by these programme elements and&#13;
respective responsibilities of the FMPU.&#13;
4.    Organizational structure&#13;
The FMPU will be managed by a firm with relevant international experience and track record in&#13;
similar donors funded projects involving similarly qualified personnel. The FMPU will be managed&#13;
by a senior Unit Manager, and be comprised of three units.&#13;
I -   Accounting and Disbursement Section: This section will be divided in two sub-&#13;
sections that will be responsible for the financial accounting and budgeting systems&#13;
(special account, disbursement) of NCRRR and NCDDR respectively. The two sub-&#13;
sections will co-ordinate and segregate the management of RRR and DDR funds.&#13;
Two line Accounting Managers (one for each institution) will be assigned to handle&#13;
the day-to-day financial transactions and accounting for each institution.&#13;
2 -   Procurement Section:  This section will ensure that all donors procurement&#13;
arrangements are strictly followed and enforced according to their requirements and&#13;
guidelines. In particular, the unit will be responsible for the preparation of necessary&#13;
bid documents, and will assist NCRRR and NCDDR with the procurement of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

approximately US$1 million of goods. The section may also provide some&#13;
assistance to partner organisations implementing sub-projects to prepare simplified&#13;
bid documents (for small-scale civil works) or to bulk procure some inputs such as&#13;
fertilizer.&#13;
3 -   Internal Control Section: This section will be managed by a Control Officer and will&#13;
be responsible for ensuring that all elements of the internal control system are carried&#13;
out efficiently. The unit will conduct, inter alia, random checking of payments&#13;
effected to various beneficiaries; verify that contracts and goods or services, etc.&#13;
have been executed and delivered by various contractors and suppliers as agreed; and&#13;
ensure that the internal procedures of both NCRRR and NCDDR are properly applied&#13;
by the staff of the institutions.&#13;
5.    Staffing&#13;
The FMPU will be headed by a qualified and experienced senior management professional with&#13;
experience in public administration, accounting, or project management with more than 10 years of&#13;
professional experience. The Manager of the Unit will oversee the work of the FMPU and report&#13;
directly to the Commissioner of NCRRR and the Executive Secretary of the NCDDR. It is expected&#13;
that the Manager will be supported by three to four professional staff who will be responsible for the&#13;
day-to-day accounting, procurement and internal control functions of the Unit.&#13;
Additional local staff will be required as necessary to assist with accounting, disbursement, control,&#13;
expenditure review and project and sub-project procurement issues. It is expected that the FMPU&#13;
will have an adequate complement of junior professional and support staff to fulfill its&#13;
responsibilities. The specific number and type of support staff to be present in the FMPU will be left&#13;
up to the discretion of the private institution awarded the contract for the set-up and operation of the&#13;
FMPU.&#13;
The consultant firm will be responsible for the recruitement, hiring and compensation of all staff of&#13;
the FMPU.&#13;
6.    Special and Project Accounts&#13;
The GOSL (through the Ministry of Finance) will authorize the FMPU to open and operate&#13;
necessary special and project accounts on behalf of NCRRR and NCDDR for donors and GOSL&#13;
counterpart funding programmes. The FMPU will manage these accounts and make payments to&#13;
vendors, contractors and individual beneficiaries (in the case of ex-combatants) once authorized to&#13;
do so by NCRRR and NCDDR. All accounts managed by FMPU will be operated with two&#13;
signatures, of which one must always be the FMPU Manager. For funds that support NCRRR&#13;
activities, either the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner, NCRRR, will counter-sign checks; for&#13;
funds that support NCDDR activities, either the Executive Secretary or his representative will&#13;
counter-sign. Special payment requests and withdrawal applications for replenishment to donors&#13;
must also be signed by the authorized representative of the Ministry of Finance upon request by&#13;
either the Executive Secretary of NCDDR or the Commissioner of NCRRR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

7.    Audit&#13;
By law in Sierra Leone, the GOSL Auditor General is responsible for auditing public funds.&#13;
However, considering the heavy volume of work already assigned to the Auditor General's&#13;
Department, the exceptional situation, and logistic adjustment the Government ministries and&#13;
agencies are going through, and that the continuing viability of the ERSF and DDR programmes&#13;
demands prompt periodic auditing of their accounts, it is recommend that the Auditor General&#13;
delegate the auditing of the ERSF and DDR funds to an external auditing firm appointed by him for&#13;
that purpose. Semi-annual audits will be required of all accounts under the control of the FMPU.&#13;
8.    Timing, Duration and Work Station&#13;
The contract for the FMPU Consultant firn will be for three (3) years, subject to performance. It is&#13;
expected that the contract for these technical assistance services would be signed between the GOSL&#13;
and the successful bidder towards the end of CY 1998. Therefore, all responsive bids must indicate&#13;
that all proposed staff would be able to take up post by this time.&#13;
All staff of the FPMU will be based in Freetown, Sierra Leone, however, some travel will be&#13;
required to the provincial cities and district headquarters in order to assist in monitoring the regional&#13;
financial officers and implementing partners. It is expected that FMPU staff will be required to&#13;
travel up-country approximately 5 days per quarter.&#13;
9.    Services, Equipment and Materials Provided by GOSL&#13;
The Government will provide to the Consultant all necessary licenses, pernits, duty-free waivers for&#13;
office equipment and for personal goods of expatriate staff, and relevant reports, etc., necessary for the&#13;
set up and operation of the FMPU. However, all required goods, equipment, furnishings and other&#13;
essential inputs needed for the Financial Management and Procurement Unit should be included as part&#13;
of the Consultants Financial Proposal.&#13;

FMPU Staff Terms of Reference:&#13;
FMPU Manager&#13;
The Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) is in the process of finalising agreements with the World&#13;
Bank, AfDB and other donors to support the National Resettlement, Reconstruction, and&#13;
Rehabilitation and the Disarmaement, Demobilisation and Reintegration Programmes. Two&#13;
institutions will be the principal executing agencies under the World Bank, AfDB and other Donors&#13;
supported programmes: the National Commission for Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and&#13;
Resettlement (NCRRR) and the National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization, and&#13;
Reintegration (NCDDR). The GOSL is calling for the establishment of a unit, the Financial&#13;
Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU), which will have full responsibility for all financial&#13;
management, control and procurement tasks under the donor-assisted portions of the two national&#13;
programmes. This unit will be contracted out to a qualified private firm and will be headed up by an&#13;
experienced professional manager whose responsibilities and qualifications are noted below.&#13;
Duties and Responsibilities:&#13;
Responsible to the Commissioner for National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and&#13;
Rehabilitation (NCRRR), and the Executive Secretary for National Committee for Disarmament,&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR) for operational issues, the FMPU Manager will provide&#13;

DDR Program: Reintegration Component;&#13;
Considerations and Technical Assistance Needs&#13;
1.    Background&#13;
The GOSL has demonstrated solid commitment to the DDR as evidenced by a credible process, shaped&#13;
by clear and consistent policy pronouncement, supported with a functioning policy committee unit and an&#13;
Executive Secretariat - both constituting the institutional framework for managing and coordinating the&#13;
DDR program.&#13;
However limited financial resources and sporadic incursions by the rebel forces represent major&#13;
challenges to the initiation of a comprehensive disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program.&#13;
Compounding the process is the urgency of time, which holds out the inevitable option of a planning and&#13;
implementation depth atypical of conventional DDR programs. Designed to take place in a very difficult&#13;
socio-economic environment, the process offers limited possibilities for creating stable livelihoods in the&#13;
short term. Consequently, the envisaged reintegration of 2,200 members of the ex-AFSL and the&#13;
captured/surrendered members of the RUF currently encamped in Lungi garrison, is fraught with a&#13;
considerable number of complexities.&#13;
The process of initial military screening, registration, socio-economic profiling of the target groups, pre-&#13;
discharge orientation activities (socio-psychological counseling, civic education as well as vocational and&#13;
skills orientation) and discharge are planned to take place between August 1998 and January 1999 - a&#13;
five month timeframe considered insufficient by any standard. Although the cumulative and extended&#13;
period of encampment has engendered an intense and restless feeling of uneasiness among the&#13;
combatants, it has also fostered an expectation of quick discharge and reintegration into civilian life - an&#13;
expectation that cannot be overlooked in the planning and implementation of the reintegration process.&#13;
The reintegration component of the DDR program is envisioned to be an integral part of an overall&#13;
national reconciliation and reconstruction strategy. It is proposed that demobilization will take place in&#13;
three phases, between July 1998 and January 2000. Phase I, referring to the currently detained&#13;
AFSL/RUF ex-combatants in Lungi (LDC), was scheduled for July 1998 to January 1999. However, to&#13;
facilitate the reintegration of these ex-combatants into civilian life a concerted effort needs to be put in&#13;
place, involving all stakeholders, to develop a careful and realistic strategy which can be implemented in&#13;
the very near future.&#13;
In this respect the Government of Sierra Leone faces considerable challenges. These challenges need to&#13;
be met to avoid the many risks associated with re-entry of ex-combatants into a civilian society&#13;
devastated and traumatized by a protracted and destructive civil war.&#13;
The planning process of the DDR reintegration component will address two immediate issues. Firstly, a&#13;
series of activities need to be in place at LDC to ensure that the already started demobilization and&#13;
reintegration process of ex-AFSL in the camp can proceed in an appropriate and meaningful manner. It&#13;
should be recalled that prior to the launching of the improved camp management and the provision of&#13;
food and other basic needs by DFID considerable tension had been building up in and around LDC.&#13;
Recent improvement of living conditions and the ongoing registration and profiling exercise have&#13;
improved the morale in LCD. A failure to follow through with concrete social and economic reintegration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

initiatives during the encampment period may have a great impact on the success or failure of the entire&#13;
demobilization process. The social and political viability of the remainder of the DDRP could therefore&#13;
be at risk.&#13;
Secondly, a detailed and credible plan for the reinsertion and reintegration of the subsequent phases of the&#13;
DDRP needs to be developed. This plan needs to take into account the significant different starting points&#13;
for social and economic reintegration for the ex-AFSL, ex-RUF and ex-CDF combatants, respectively.&#13;
The design and planning of the social and economic reintegration measures needs to be consistent with&#13;
the following overall principles:&#13;
*   Targeted assistance to ex-combatants will only be provided during the reinsertion phase;&#13;
*  From the outset, longer-term reintegration assistance to ex-combatants will make optimal&#13;
use of the mechanisms established under the RRR;&#13;
*  Assistance to vulnerable groups such as female ex-combatants, disabled ex-combatants and&#13;
child ex-combatants needs to utilize and strengthen the existing in-country capacity of&#13;
organizations already on the ground.&#13;
2.    Strategy Framework for Social and Economic Reintegration&#13;
To prepare the ex-combatants adequately for their re-entry into civilian life, the DDR reintegration&#13;
framework needs to incorporate the following components:&#13;
* Social reintegration, including both socio-psychological counseling and civic education;&#13;
* These components are intended to address psychological factors, which distort patterns of&#13;
behavior while providing the ex-combatants with positive attitudes towards civic&#13;
responsibilities, respect for democratic culture and skills for conflict resolution.&#13;
Economic reintegration, including vocational and post-discharge orientation. The focus of economic&#13;
reintegration is to equip the ex-combatants with productive skills and options for employment as effective&#13;
means to successful transition to civilian life.  The proposed Training and Employment Fund,&#13;
employment-intensive public works and promotion of artisan enterprise development are variety of&#13;
programs designed to serve this purpose and provide linkage with the emergency recovery social fund.&#13;
Community sensitization and information campaign:&#13;
* A major precondition for successful reintegration of ex-combatants is the receptiveness of&#13;
their various communities regarding their return and resettlement. Pervasive feelings of&#13;
mistrust, animosity and other forms of social tension engendered by war calls for a&#13;
systematic process of re-engineering social relationships and perceptions. Conversely, to&#13;
accommodate reintegration of ex-combatants, specific attitudinal transformation needs to be&#13;
inculcated in the returning ex-combatants to prepare them for eventual reintegration in the&#13;
local communities. These processes require the design of a comprehensive program of&#13;
community sensitization and information dissemination.&#13;
Within the context of the DDR program, an Information and Community Sensitization is anticipated to&#13;
focus on (i) the ex-combatants currently encamped in Lungi; (ii) the intended communities of return;&#13;
(iii) as well as a nationwide audience. Detailed planning for each component needs to be developed&#13;
within a couple of weeks with overlapping and incremental implementation process. The constraints of&#13;
&#13;

time not only demand concurrent planning but also simultaneous implementation of the strategy&#13;
components.&#13;
3.    Analysis of expectation and target group profiles&#13;
During the registration of the ex-combatants a short socio-economic profile will be established. These&#13;
socio-economic profiles form the baseline infornation on educational background, professional&#13;
experience and future professional expectations of the ex-combatants. The analysis of these profiles&#13;
should provide useful information to the reintegration planners and implementers in terms of areas of&#13;
district of re-settlement, the requirements to facilitate return to the respective districts, intended&#13;
occupations and relevant skills requirements. The socio-economic data collected from the registration&#13;
process and from the rapid inventory of skills among the ex-combatants are essential to program both&#13;
social and economic reintegration initiatives. Convergence of skills with chosen district of settlement and&#13;
opportunities for employment in the local labor market are crucial in achieving anticipated results of any&#13;
vocational improvement and employment generation program.&#13;
4.    Training needs assessment and identification of skills gaps&#13;
To support the social and economic reintegration process it is further recommended to carry out a rapid&#13;
training needs assessment in the formal and informal sectors of the Sierra Leone economy. This training&#13;
needs assessment could be carried out through an establishment survey and/or through the use of rapid&#13;
urban and rural appraisal techniques. Parallel to this training needs assessment a rapid appraisal of&#13;
economic opportunities could be carried out. More insight into the skill requirements of the labor market&#13;
and potential market niches will enable the ex-combatants to make a more informed choice regarding&#13;
their employment and income generating opportunities. This type of assessment would also inform&#13;
training providers about the current level and quantity of skills demand, identify the skill gaps and&#13;
facilitate the design of means to fill these gaps.&#13;
5.    Local implementation capacity and requirement for upgrading&#13;
A rapid assessment of local capacity will provide a valid basis for a rational choice of implementing&#13;
partners in the reintegration program. The capacity of existing local institutions to deliver the required&#13;
program for skills improvement and to participate in the reconstruction and rehabilitation program&#13;
remains unclear. Considerable looting and destruction of the facilities of most local institutions remains a&#13;
major constrain. This becomes obvious when contrasted against the sizeable capital investment required&#13;
to upgrade their equipment. Under the current time constraints, the mission recommends to initiate&#13;
immediate pilot activities to test the potential for upgrading capacity of local institutions to provide on-&#13;
site training orientation and other components of the reintegration program for the phase 1 operation in&#13;
Lungi. However, balancing the requirement for upgrading of local institutional capacity against the&#13;
exigency of engaging foreign expertise remains a delicate decision that will influence the quality, time&#13;
and cost of program delivery. Technical Assistance will be required to assist in the design of program and&#13;
management of the process.&#13;

6.    Options for reintegration&#13;
During the encampment the possibilities for organizing an extensive skills training program will be&#13;
limited due to the time constraints under which the reintegration program is being developed. However,&#13;
the data and information to be derived from the socio-economic profiles, the economic opportunities and&#13;
training needs assessment, and the assessment of local implementation capacities are essential building&#13;
blocks for developing an appropriate vocational orientation program for the ex-combatants. The&#13;
vocational orientation would have to be planned and implemented with the assistance of local training&#13;
providers who have developed or are in the process of developing tailor-made short courses for ex-&#13;
combatants. Within the framework of this orientation, the possibility of organizing on-site workshops and&#13;
on-site trade exhibitions would have to be explored with those training providers. Such workshops or&#13;
such an exhibition of the use and content of a variety of skills would facilitate a more informed career&#13;
choice for the ex-combatants. A more comprehensive training program will be developed and provided&#13;
within the context of the Training and Employment Fund.&#13;
After the discharge, a rmenu of different social and economic reintegration options could be available to&#13;
the ex-combatants. Recent plans for reintegration assistance in other post-conflict situations have&#13;
included all, a combination of or some of the following:&#13;
- Rehabilitation of basic social, economic and physical infrastructure;&#13;
Revitalization of basic social services;&#13;
* Community-based rural development programs;&#13;
L Labor-intensive public works programs;&#13;
- Agricultural programs&#13;
- Skill development in technical and/or entrepreneurial skills to facilitate employment or self-&#13;
employment (including apprenticeships);&#13;
- Adult education (literacy, numeracy, life-skills, etc.);&#13;
* Self-employment through the creation of small and micro enterprises;&#13;
*  Provision of micro-credit, self-employment tool kits, and support services (counseling and&#13;
guidance, job placement, etc.) for assisting reintegration into different activities;&#13;
*  Targeted activities for vulnerable groups, such as, disabled ex-combatants, child soldiers,&#13;
etc.;&#13;
Within the context of the DDR reintegration component, it is important to recommend realistic options to&#13;
the ex-combatants. DDR will therefore be responsible for the provision of counseling and referral&#13;
services at the regional and district level, which will provide ex-combatants with information about&#13;
potential opportunities for employment, participation in the private sector, and community-based&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation activities. It is important to note that in principle the implementation&#13;
strategy of the CRRP is to use a community-based demand driven project identification and development&#13;
process. Ex-combatants will additionally have access to an employment, vocational training and&#13;
apprenticeship fund known as the regional Training and Employment Fund (TEF). The TEF will facilitate&#13;
access to apprenticeships or other skills training, and will subsidize employment opportunities where&#13;
possible.&#13;
As far as post-discharge social reintegration is concerned, a community sensitization and information&#13;
campaign for ex-combatants, communities and the general public will be essential. This has already been&#13;
emphasized by GOSL as an issue of overarching importance. Important steps have been taken so far,&#13;
including public announcement of the terms and conditions of the DDRP as well as a high profile&#13;
televised debate and information program on the DDRP. These initiatives need to be followed up by a&#13;

more detailed and well-planned sensitization campaign. Such a campaign would have the following&#13;
elements: (i) immediate community level sensitization in and around LDC based on, and in collaboration&#13;
with, the considerable potential of local groups, networks and individuals that each in their own way are&#13;
working towards practical community based reconciliation; (ii) a national level campaign, through the&#13;
print media, radio and television and other appropriate means; (iii) sensitization in the region prior to and&#13;
in concurrence with the establishment of the DDRP's Regional Reintegration Offices; (iv) community&#13;
level campaigns in preparation for the return of ex-combatants. It is furthennore essential that this&#13;
sensitization campaign links up concretely with the different youth development activities and the&#13;
participatory consultation exercises that are currently being undertaken by various local and international&#13;
organizations.&#13;
7.    Design consideration and implementation requirements.&#13;
Major design considerations are as follows:&#13;
*   Relevance and quality of the content of training program and other forms of reintegration&#13;
assistance to the ex-combatants to constitute sufficient inducement and motivation to&#13;
participate in on-camp and off-camp programs.&#13;
*   Capacity for rapid and on-site deployment by delivering agencies contracted to implement&#13;
specific component of the reintegration program is vital for flexibility in the design and&#13;
implementation of the program&#13;
*   Options for incremental reintegration through public works-labor-intensive programs and&#13;
phased assistance to support initial re-insertiation allowance are critical to reducing not only&#13;
a dominant impression of rewarding rebellion but also fostering community acceptance of&#13;
the ex-combatants.&#13;
*   Orientation towards acquisition of life-skills and enterprise development support should&#13;
drive the process of vocational training and other reintegration assistance. Within this&#13;
context, the option of private sector participation should be explored.&#13;
8.    Technical Assistance Requirements&#13;
Within the context of the DDR reintegration program technical assistance will be required to assist the&#13;
Secretariat in the planning and design of the reintegration activities for the ex-combatants currently&#13;
encamped in Lungi. It is recommended to provide the Secretariat with a social reintegration specialist, an&#13;
economic reintegration specialist and a community sensitization specialist. The terms of reference for&#13;
these positions are attached.&#13;

Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
Reinsertion and Reintegration Unit Manager&#13;
National Committee for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR)&#13;
Executive Secretariat&#13;
Background&#13;
In June 1998, following more than seven years of civil war and illegal junta rule, the recently&#13;
reinstated Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) took the initiative to develop a comprehensive&#13;
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) program aimed at dealing with an estimated&#13;
35,000 ex-combatants including members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Armed Forces of&#13;
sierra Leone, and the Civil Defense Forces. Considerable progress was made to initiate work under this&#13;
DDR program during the last six months, however, an upsurge in fighting in late 1998, culminating in an&#13;
attack on and battle for Freetown in early January 1999, resulted in the suspension of the program.&#13;
ECOMOG forces were able to re-establish security in Freetown and Western region and cleared major&#13;
highways to allow access to the country.&#13;
Subsequent to the attack on Freetown, there is a growing understanding that for sustainable long-&#13;
term peace and security in the country, a political settlement is preferable. Consequently the UN, in&#13;
concert with major bilateral partners, facilitated a peace negotiation between rebel leader Sankoh and&#13;
RUF commanders as well as the Government and other Rebel groups. The outcome was the Lome Peace&#13;
Agreement which provided the basis for a negotiated settlement to the conflict. Under the specific&#13;
provision of the agreement, the United Nation Military Observer Mission (UNOMSIL) and Monitoring&#13;
Group of West African States (ECOMOG) will enforce cease fire and oversee the disarmament,&#13;
demobilization of all surrendered forces as part of the comprehensive DDR program.&#13;
In anticipation of a rapid resolution of the current conflict, international partners of the GOSL&#13;
made committments to assist the Government re-start and plan for the expansion of its' DDR Program.&#13;
The Program is seen as crucial in moving forward the recently negotiated peace agreement, sustain a&#13;
viable cease-fire agreement as well as provide vital momentum to sustainable peace and longer-term&#13;
security. Specifically, long-term technical assistance position would be required to manage the various&#13;
aspects of the Reintegration measures which have been identified to support successful return of&#13;
demobilised ex-combatants under the DDR program of the Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR. Given&#13;
the special nature of the DDR responsibilities, and the lack of in-country experience in these areas, as&#13;
well as to maintain credibility and neutrality in the program, it is recommended that selected candidate&#13;
will serve as unit technical manager in the related area and maintain overall responsibility for the day to&#13;
day management of the program of their respective units within Executive Secretariat of NCDDR to&#13;
which they will be attached. The responsibilities outline below represent the broad terms of reference for&#13;
the Reinsertion and Reintegration Unit Manager.&#13;
Context&#13;
The purpose of the DDR Program is to facilitate the process whereby combatants from both sides&#13;
of the conflict gradually and peacefully return to normal and productive civilian lives. Specifically, the&#13;
DDR would finance activities aimed at disarming and demobilizing combatants (including registration,&#13;
medical screening, and socio-economic profiling, pre-discharge orientation programs), providing&#13;
reinsertion assistance (including departure allowances, transitional safety net allowance and facilitating&#13;
access to land) and reintegration support (including vocational and/or non-formal education,&#13;
apprenticeships, information and referral services, counseling, community relations and civic education).&#13;

An effective Reinsertion and Reintegration program would provide for ex-combatants opportunities to&#13;
become productive members of their home communities. The opportunities would involve activities in&#13;
support of social and economic reintegration assistance beginning with the pre-discharge orientation&#13;
activities during demobilization, transitional allowances upon discharge and training, employment and&#13;
self employment upon settlement in home communities. The candidate should respond with great degree&#13;

Community Sensitization Specialist&#13;
NCDDR / NCRRR&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
Background:&#13;
A major precondition for successful reintegration of ex-combatants is the receptiveness of their various&#13;
communities regarding their return and resettlement. Pervasive feelings of mistrust, animosity and other&#13;
forms of social tension engendered by war demand the establishment of a systematic process of re-&#13;
establishing social relationships and perceptions. Conversely, to accommodate the reintegration of ex-&#13;
combatants, specific attitudinal transformation needs to be inculcated in the returning ex-combatants to&#13;
prepare them for eventual reintegration in the local communities. These processes require the design of a&#13;
comprehensive program of community sensitization and information dissemination.&#13;
Within the context of the DDR program, an Information and Community Sensitization specialist will be&#13;
required to assist the Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR and the NCRRR in the planning and design of&#13;
an information and sensitization campaign. The campaign will target (i) the ex-combatants currently&#13;
encamped in Lungi (ii) the intended communities of return (iii) as well as nationwide audience.&#13;
Initially, the task will cover a period of six weeks, starting from the second week of September 1998. If&#13;
necessary, a follow-up mission might be necessary to evaluate the impact and fine-tune the sensitization&#13;
and reintegration program. The assignment will outline activities for raising social awareness and civic&#13;
responsibilities and will essentially include the following: (i) an assessment of existing local capacities&#13;
and the framework for coordination of the process; (ii) the design of a comprehensive national strategy&#13;
on reconciliation and social rehabilitation; (iii) the development of broad content and message and (iv)&#13;
the identification of credible mechanism for the delivery of message.&#13;
Duties and Responsibilities:&#13;
The specific responsibilities of the specialist will comprise the following:&#13;
*   Analyze the capacity and identify potential implementing agencies in the field of&#13;
information and community sensitization.&#13;
*   Direct the preparation of comprehensive national strategy for community sensitization.&#13;
*   Assist implementation agencies in designing target specific programs of re-engineering&#13;
social conception regarding the ex-combatants and other war-affected groups.&#13;
*   Workout strategies for collaboration with national and international agencies currently&#13;
operating in the field of community sensitization.&#13;
*   Assess and review the effectiveness of the message and content of the community&#13;
sensitization program as well as ascertain the effectiveness of the medium of information&#13;
dissemination.&#13;
*   Develop terms of reference, procedures, criteria and performance indicators as the basis for&#13;
contracting implementing agencies and monitoring results.&#13;
*   Assist in the review and identification appropriate programs of community sensitization.&#13;
*   Elaborate implementation plans, phasing and the budgets for the Executive Secretariat.&#13;

TORs: Project Financial Audit&#13;
Objective&#13;
The objective of the audit of the Program Financial Statement (PFS) is to enable the auditor to express a&#13;
professional opinion on the financial position of the various donors funds (World Bank, AfDB, other&#13;
Donors) allocated to the National Resettlement, Reconstruction, and Rehabilitation Program and managed&#13;
by the Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) at each fiscal year, semi-annually for three&#13;
(3) years, starting from June 30, 1999. The auditor is also required to express separate opinions on the&#13;
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) and the Special Accounts (SA) for the funds received and&#13;
expenditures occurred for the accounting period ended at the same dates. It is also expected to express&#13;
separate opinions on the accounts for other donors according to their reporting requirements.&#13;
The program accounts (books of account) provide the basis for preparation of the PFS and are established&#13;
to reflect the financial transactions in respect of the program, as maintained by the FMPU.&#13;
Scope&#13;
The audit will be carried out in accordance with International Standards of Auditing, and will include&#13;
such tests and controls as the auditor considers necessary under the circumstances. In addition, the auditor&#13;
should pay special attention to the following:&#13;

June 30, December 31, 1999, 2000, 2001 and of resources and expenditures for the semi-annual&#13;
years ended on those dates.&#13;
Program Financial Statements&#13;
The Program Financial Statements should include:&#13;
(a)    a Statement of Source (summary of funds received, showing the World Bank, ADB other donors&#13;
funds, Government Counterpart funds, and beneficiary contribution separately) and Application&#13;
of Funds (summary of Expenditures shown under the main program headings and by main&#13;
categories of expenditures for the current year);&#13;
(b)    a Balance Sheet showing Accumulated Funds of the Program, bank balances, fixed assets,&#13;
inventories, other assets of the program, and liabilities, if any; and&#13;
(c)    notes to the financial statements presenting background information on the program, the&#13;
accounting principles, details analysis and relevant explanation of the main accounts/major&#13;
balances, etc.&#13;
Statements of Expenditures&#13;
In addition to the audit of the PFS, the auditor is required to audit all SOEs used during the year under&#13;
review as the basis for the submission of withdrawal applications. The auditor should apply such tests and&#13;
controls as the auditor considers necessary under the circumstances, ensuring that the existing internal&#13;
control procedures for the preparation and processing of the said SOEs are sound and reliable. The&#13;
auditor should examine carefully the expenditures to ensure that: i) they are genuine program&#13;
expenditures and eligible with regard to the relevant financing agreement and with reference to the&#13;
program documents of the donors for guidance when considered necessary; and ii) they are reasonable&#13;
with respect to the planned activities included in the annual work program and budget. Where ineligible&#13;
expenditures are identified as having been included in withdrawal applications and reimbursed against,&#13;
there should be a schedule listing individual SOE withdrawal applications for specific reference number&#13;
and amount. The total withdrawals under the SOE procedure should agree with the overall reconciliation&#13;
of bank disbursements prepared by the program and described above. A separate opinion to that effect&#13;
will be issued by the auditor as indicated in the introductory paragraph.&#13;
Special Accounts&#13;
In conjunction with the audit of the Program Financial Statement, the auditor is also required to prepare a&#13;
Special Account reconciliation and audit the activities on the Special Accounts associated with the&#13;
Program. The Special Account usually comprise but is not limited to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

* deposit and replenishments received from the donors&#13;
* payment substantiated by withdrawal applications&#13;
* interest that may be earned from the balances and which belong to the borrower; and&#13;
* the remaining balances at the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
The auditor must form a separate opinion as to the degree of compliance with the Bank's procedures and&#13;
the balance of the Special Account at the year-end. The audit should examine the eligibility and&#13;
correctness and financial transactions during the period under review and fund balances at the end of such&#13;
a period, the operation and use of the SA in accordance with the financing agreement, and the adequacy&#13;
of internal controls for this type of disbursement mechanism.&#13;
For the program, the Special Accounts are referred to in legal agreements between the donors and the&#13;
Government of Sierra Leone. Special Accounts statements and the auditor's separate opinion thereon&#13;
should accompany the Program Financial Statements.&#13;
Internal Control System&#13;
The auditor is required to perform an in-depth and comprehensive review of the program internal control&#13;
system. Such a review would be larger in scope than what is normally required for ordinary audits. The&#13;
objective of the review is to provide the auditor with sufficient understanding of the rules and procedures&#13;
of the internal control system, including the existing administrative, accounting, financial, and budgetary&#13;
Manual of procedures, and to determine whether the said rules and procedures are adequate, reliable, and&#13;
operating correctly. In this vein, the auditor should assess with particular attention and determine&#13;
whether: i) the computerized financial accounting, and reporting system in place is appropriate; ii) the&#13;
accounting and financial staff within the FMPU is capable of managing the program efficiently using the&#13;
computerized system. The findings and observations of the auditor should be presented in a separate&#13;
report, the Management Letter, addressed along with the audit report to the borrower's representative.&#13;
The Management Letter should highlight all the weaknesses in the program internal control system,&#13;
assess the inherent risks associated with the internal control shortcomings, and make practical and&#13;
relevant recommendations to improve the system as well as to enhance the managerial skills and&#13;
capability of the accounting and financial staff. In the Management Letter, the auditor will, inter-alia:&#13;
(a)    give comments and observations on the accounting records, systems and controls that were&#13;
examined during the course of the audit;&#13;
(b)   identify specific deficiencies and areas of weakness in systems and controls and make&#13;
recommendation for their improvement;&#13;
(c)   report on the degree of compliance of each of the financial covenants on the financing agreement&#13;
and give comments, if any, on internal and external matters affecting such compliance;&#13;
(d)    communicate matter that have come to attention during the audit which might have a significant&#13;
impact on the implementation of the project;&#13;
(e)    bring to the borrower's attention any other matters that auditors considers pertinent.&#13;
&#13;

Interim Audit&#13;
The auditor is required to carry out an interim audit (after 9 months of activities) for each year.&#13;
He should perform during the interim audit: i) a comprehensive review of the internal control system,&#13;
ii) an assessment of the proper recording/accounting of the transactions, and iii) an in-depth review of the&#13;
Statement of Expenditures up to that date (the review of the remaining months should be carried out&#13;
during annual audits). The auditor should prepare an interim audit report as a result of his audit to be&#13;
discussed with the Program Coordinator before distribution by the latter to the donors.&#13;
Audit Report&#13;
The auditor is required to prepare and produce for each annual audit:&#13;
a)    the audit report/short forrn report containing: i) the auditor professional opinion on the Project&#13;
Financial Statements, the actual audited financial statements, and the notes to the audited&#13;
Financial Statements; ii) a separate opinion on the SOEs along with a schedule of SOEs used&#13;
during the fiscal year (sequence number, date, description, and amount) and commenting on the&#13;
accuracy and propriety of expenditures withdrawn under SOEs procedures and the extend to&#13;
which the Bank can rely on SOEs as a basis for credit disbursement; and iii) a separate opinion&#13;
on the Special Accounts commenting on the degree of compliance with the Bank's procedures&#13;
and the eligibility and correctness of the financial transactions through the Special Account&#13;
during the year, and&#13;
b)    the Management Letter reporting on the major internal control weakness as well as managerial&#13;
deficiencies and making relevant and practical recommendations for improvement.&#13;
The auditor should submit the audit report (short form) and the Management Letter to the borrower's&#13;
designated representative within six (6) months of the end of the fiscal year. The latter should transmit&#13;
copies to the Ministry of Finance and promptly forward three (3) copies to each donor.&#13;
General&#13;
The auditor should be given access to and he should consult all legal documents (Loan/Grant&#13;
Agreements), Appraisal Reports, supervision reports, correspondences, and any other information&#13;
associated with the project and deemed necessary by the auditor.&#13;
It is highly desirable that the auditor become familiar with the donors' guidelines on financial reporting&#13;
and auditing of projects which summarize their financial reporting and auditing requirements. The auditor&#13;
should also be familiar with the donors' disbursement manuals. Those documents will be provided by the&#13;
Financial Manager of the FMPU.&#13;

Consultancy to Design the Monitoring and Evaluation System&#13;
for the Government of Sierra Leone&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
The signing of the Lome Peace Agreement in July 1999 brought a spirit of hope to the&#13;
people of Sierra Leone. Government and the people now look forward to moving the&#13;
country from a period of emergency to one of reconstruction and resettlement. The&#13;
implementation of the long-delayed socio-economic recovery programme should assist&#13;
with the consolidation of the peace and laying the foundations for sustained economic&#13;
growth. To this end, the Commission eagerly looks forward to kick starting the NRRRP&#13;
which was abrogated by political instability which has was predicated by civil conflict.&#13;
Given the fact Government is in partnership with other stakeholders and implementing&#13;
partners, it is a necessary condition that a robust but effective and flexible monitoring&#13;
and evaluation system is set up that would be economy-wide, but embraces the various&#13;
compartments or sub-programmes/projects of the other stakeholders and implementing&#13;
partners. This system would harmonise all the other sub-systems and generate a&#13;
common data- base from which the entire spectrum of assistance to the country's&#13;
recovery programme can be evaluated&#13;
The NCRRR and its partner agencies recognise the need for an effective and holistic&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system that will provide accurate and timely information on&#13;
the entire economic and social recovery programmes and sub-projects that are being&#13;
implemented countrywide. This should enable the making of appropriate and timely&#13;
management decisions. It is in this context that this consultancy is required&#13;
OBJECTIVE&#13;
Working with the Director of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation as the National&#13;
Counterpart, the consultant will assist the Commission to develop a comprehensive M &amp;&#13;
E system for the NRRP which will take into account all the sub-programmes being&#13;
implemented by the various partners of the Government in the socio-economic recovery&#13;
process.&#13;
The system to be developed should provide senior management with an effective tool&#13;
to:&#13;
* Provide a bird's eye view of the entire NRRP at a glance;&#13;
* Assess the administrative performance of the central and regional levels of the&#13;
NCRRR;&#13;

outputs related to these;&#13;
* Based on the programme and individual project components, develop the framework&#13;
and quantitative indicators for the overall programme performance as regards to:&#13;
i)   overall funding of programme&#13;
ii)  institutional capacity of NCRRR to manage programmes;&#13;
iii)  individual project inputs, outputs and outcomes&#13;
iv)   service delivery performance including a measure for effectiveness of the ERSF&#13;
and other sub-project review, approval and disbursements of funds&#13;
v)   ensuring an equitable balance in approved sub-projects in terms of geographical&#13;
distribution, priority sectors and especially vulnerable groups such as women&#13;
and ex-combatants&#13;
t Examine existing and proposed reporting procedures and formats and recommend,&#13;
when relevant, revisions and additions necessary for the satisfactory performance of&#13;
the M&amp;E system.&#13;
* Develop a strategy for the computerisation of M&amp;E information taking into account&#13;
the existing conditions and human resource capacity;&#13;
* Based on the computerisation strategy, develop an implementation plan for setting&#13;
up a computerized database using standard software (Microsoft Windows 98&#13;
compatible).&#13;

OVERVIEW OF THE EMERGENCY RECOVERY SUPPORT FUND&#13;
(REVISED AUGUST 1998)&#13;
1. Overview&#13;
The Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF) is a Government of Sierra Leone initiative co-ordinated&#13;
by the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NCRRR) to help&#13;
address the negative social and economic affects of more than seven years of civil war and ten months of&#13;
junta rule. The Commission has been charged with the responsibility of helping rebuild the country and&#13;
will do so in collaboration with key donor and implementing partner organizations. Several donor&#13;
organizations, including the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the UNDP, will support the&#13;
efforts of the Commission to address the urgent needs of resettling displaced people and refugees,&#13;
restoring basic social services and infrastructure in the war affected areas, reintegrating ex-combatants,&#13;
and addressing the needs of peace building and reconciliation. The ERSF will also support a labor-&#13;
intensive public works program designed to assist the poorest members of society in the principal urban&#13;
centers.&#13;
The ERSF will finance community-based projects, which address the priority needs of internally&#13;
displaced persons, refugees, former combatants, and vulnerable groups in urban centers. The Fund will&#13;
be used to address multi-sectoral needs; starting with more urgent food production and temporary shelter,&#13;
and running through medium and longer term concerns for basic infrastructure repair and rehabilitation of&#13;
productive assets. These projects will be implemented by eligible partners who include international and&#13;
national NGOs, government line ministries, existing donor project units, and qualified community-based&#13;
organizations.&#13;
The Commission and the ERSF can only begin to support the long process of rebuilding the country;&#13;
other funding and implementation strategies will be necessary to address the overall needs for&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation. As the country moves from an emergency recovery phase to a longer-&#13;
term developmental one, more strategic sectoral investment programs implemented through the&#13;
respective line ministries and implementing partners will be required.  As well as sharing this&#13;
responsibility for helping rebuild the country with line ministries and implementing partners, the ERSF&#13;
must also serve to catalyze the self-help efforts of each village. In the end, the local population must take&#13;
the initiative and responsibility for rebuilding the individual lives, community infrastructure, and social&#13;
ties negatively affected by the war and unrest.&#13;
The Fund will rely on a decentralized bottom-up project planning, approval and monitoring process,&#13;
which taps into and builds upon existing systems and structures at the regional and local levels. NGOs,&#13;
line ministries and other entities will be called upon to design sub-projects in close collaboration with&#13;
village, section and chiefdom authorities. Regional NCRRR staff will have primary responsibility for&#13;
day-to-day management of the project review process. Regional committees will be formed and&#13;
composed of two NCRRR staff members, a Ministry of Finance, Development and Economic Planning&#13;
representative, the regional HACU field officer, and one representative of the implementing partners to&#13;
be selected by the Inter-agency Forum. These regional Projects Committees will have the responsibility&#13;
and authority to approve projects up to a maximum given level. NCRRR headquarters' staff will provide&#13;
the broad policy and program-planning framework for the ERSF, monitor its implementation and co-&#13;
ordinate the overall process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Sierra Leone                                                     Attachment II: Page 2 of 13&#13;
The ERSF has been designed through a process of consultation, investigation, and consensus building&#13;
initiated by the then Ministry of National Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Resettlement, and others, in&#13;
mid-1996. Over a ten-month period immediately preceding the coup, MNRRR staff, central and regional&#13;
government authorities, national and international NGOs, and key international agencies and donors&#13;
involved in the rehabilitation and recovery process were consulted on how best such a funding&#13;
mechanism should work. This collaborative process culminated in two stakeholder workshops to&#13;
elaborate and finalize these procedures with Ministry staff, NGO representatives, HACU and the World&#13;
Bank held in November 1996 and May 1997. The workshop participants identified nine principles,&#13;
which should underpin both the design and implementation of the ERSF. These are:&#13;
1. the ERSF and the National Resettlement, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Program (NRRRP) is&#13;
operating in a dynamic and changing environment-- therefore, the Fund's operation systems must be&#13;
flexible and open to revision as the situation on the ground and in the provinces also changes,&#13;
2. given the fluid nature of the program environment, phasing of different aspects of the Fund, and its&#13;
administrative systems, must be considered,&#13;
3. the Fund's administration should be decentralized and have a regional focus,&#13;
4. the Fund should tie into existing systems and structures; be coordinated and integrated at provincial&#13;
levels,&#13;
5. the project review and monitoring process must be open and transparent,&#13;
6. the systems must operate quickly without sacrificing accountability,&#13;
7. the Fund should support productive activities,&#13;
8. the Fund should emphasize community and stakeholder participation, and&#13;
9. the administrative procedures should not adversely affect the existing relationships among NGOs, or&#13;
between NGOs and the communities with which they work.&#13;
The consultative process used to arrive at these procedures created a shared vision of how the ERSF&#13;
should work, and a shared responsibility for its successful implementation among the Commission and its&#13;
implementing partners. This spirit of partnership and collaboration should be maintained as the Fund&#13;
begins operating. If the systems and procedures do not function as envisioned then it should be seen as&#13;
the joint responsibility of all parties to ensure that a new system be put in place that works. Furthermore,&#13;
subsequent reviews and revisions of these systems should draw upon these same collaborative&#13;
mechanisms and co-operation to devise ways of better implementing the program as experience is gained.&#13;
Specifically, NCRRR will conduct a detailed review of the ERSF procedures and projects six months&#13;
after the fund is fully operational (expected to be October, 1998) in order to test the effectiveness of the&#13;
procedures proposed herein. The review will look at, inter alia, the effectiveness of the project review&#13;
process, the membership of the approval committees, the level of project approval authority at regional&#13;
level, and community representation in the overall process.&#13;
This document serves as both an overview of the ERSF for donors and other interested parties, and as&#13;
guidelines to potential implementing partners for the preparation of project proposals for consideration by&#13;
the NCRRR. The document is divided into four subsequent sections that deal with the overall objectives&#13;
of the ERSF, evaluation criteria and the project selection process, administration of funds, and procedures&#13;
for project monitoring. A more detailed Operational Manual has also been prepared for use by NCRRR&#13;
staff in overseeing the implementation of the ERSF.&#13;

2. Objectives and Principles of the ERSF&#13;
The objectives of the ERSF are:&#13;
*  To assist communities and vulnerable social groups in re-establishing their livelihood and&#13;
production systems;&#13;
*  To help rehabilitate community level infrastructure (roads, schools, clinics, water systems, court&#13;
barries, rural markets, irrigation systems) damaged during the conflict and in the poorest sections&#13;
of Freetown and other urban centres, in accordance with needs and priorities as expressed by&#13;
communities themselves;&#13;
*  To support the re-establishment of basic service provision in the fields of health, education,&#13;
agriculture, etc. in areas affected by the conflict;&#13;
*  To provide support to local-level initiatives aimed at reconciliation and rebuilding social&#13;
structures damaged during the years of the conflict; and&#13;
*  To strengthen the capacity of local organisations to provide effective support to longer-term&#13;
processes of reconstruction and development.&#13;
Projects qualifying for support under the ERSF should be developed and implemented in accordance with&#13;
the following principles:&#13;
1. Enhance the opportunities for self-reliance of displaced and affected communities;&#13;
2. Strengthen local capacity to implement and manage reconstruction and development activities;&#13;
3. Promote awareness and sensitivity for gender equity and the protection of the specially&#13;
disadvantaged (e.g., children, widows and the disabled) in the decision-making process;&#13;
4. Maximize grassroots participation and input in the project cycle;&#13;
5. Promote an integrated approach to resettlement and rehabilitation; and&#13;
6. Build the objectives of maintaining peace, reconciliation andforgiveness into the resettlement&#13;
process.&#13;
3. Basic Eligibility Criteria&#13;
To be eligible for funding under the ERSF, implementing organizations and the project must meet certain&#13;
basic criteria. These criteria are sub-divided between institutional, sectoral, geographic, target group and&#13;
financial, as discussed below.&#13;
3.1 Criteria for Implementing Partners&#13;
For an organization to be eligible for funding under the ERSF it must meet the following organizational&#13;
criteria:&#13;
* be a legal entity registered in Sierra Leone and able to enter into a legally binding contract;&#13;
* have a minimum of 2 years working experience (within or outside Sierra Leone)&#13;
implementing the same or similar activities as those proposed to the ERSF;&#13;
* have adequate infrastructure and personnel currently based in the region of proposed activity&#13;

Sierra Leone                                                       Attachment II: Page 4 of 13&#13;
*   have adequate administrative and financial management systems and procedures in place to&#13;
safe guard the use of ERSF resources; and&#13;
*   have no legal dispute or debts which would materially affect the institution's ability to&#13;
undertake the project.&#13;
3.2 Project Types&#13;
In line with the overall objectives of the National Resettlement, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation&#13;
Program, the ERSF will support only those projects that address the following broad sectors and areas of&#13;
activity:&#13;
*  Agricultural Rehabilitation: including support to basic productive activities primarily&#13;
through the provision of seeds, tools and emergency food supply (using existing food&#13;
pipelines) for the farming season; support to rehabilitation of tree crops, other cash crops,&#13;
fishing (through the provision of equipment) and animal husbandry (through re-stocking of&#13;
animals and provision of veterinary drugs);&#13;
*   Shelter: principally to provide temporary shelter and provide the planning framework for&#13;
permanent facilities;&#13;
* Rehabilitation of Community Infrastructure: to support the rehabilitation of schools, health&#13;
centres, court barries, water supply, roads, rural market-places and other priorities as&#13;
identified by communities;&#13;
*   Re-establishment of Essential Services: to provide human and material resources essential to&#13;
the re-establishment of basic health and education services in collaboration with the relevant&#13;
ministries;&#13;
*   Reintegration of Vulnerable Groups: supporting the reintegration of specific groups (e.g.,&#13;
widows, female head of households, ex-combatants, children affected by the war and&#13;
disabled people) into communities; which may include temporary safety nets, vocational&#13;
training, capital/credit, counselling/trauma healing, information, employment (e.g. labour-&#13;
intensive public works), education and/or functional literacy;&#13;
*   Promotion of Reconciliation: for programs promoting reconciliation and conflict resolution&#13;
at the community level; which may include developing conflict resolution skills, promoting&#13;
reconciliation through local media, supporting youth, community and voluntary associations&#13;
with the potential for promoting reconciliation;&#13;
*   Jobs Creation through Public Works: to establish a temporary social safety net mechanism&#13;
targeting vulnerable groups of unemployed and ex-combatants living and working in urban&#13;
((Freetown and provincial capitals) and rural areas; labour-intensive works will be supported&#13;
in environmental sanitation and waste disposal, road repair and maintenance, public building&#13;
maintenance, reforestation, etc.&#13;
*   Small Enterprise Promotion and Vocational Training Schemes: designed to support&#13;
development of productive skills among individual target group members and generating&#13;
income and employment at community level; and&#13;
*   Capacity-Building: of local organisations in all of the above areas the development.&#13;
3.3 Geographic Focus&#13;
The ERSF will be active throughout the regions and districts of Sierra Leone that has been affected by the&#13;
war. Priority will be given to supporting populations returning to rural areas and for those areas most&#13;
severely affected by the war. The Fund will also support labor-intensive public works activities that&#13;
target the most vulnerable groups of unemployed in the urban and rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex                                     Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;
Sierra Leone                                                    Attachment 11: Page 5 of 13&#13;
The ERSF will co-ordinate with other donor recovery activities (e.g., EU Resettlement and Rehabilitation&#13;
Program, line ministry emergency plans, NGO initiatives, etc.) so as to avoid duplication and overlap in&#13;
their areas of operation. The procedures and mechanisms for project review and approval will also&#13;
support the funding mechanism of the Government's Social Action and Poverty Alleviation (SAPA)&#13;
Program, which is located within NCRRR.&#13;
3.4 Target Groups&#13;
To be eligible for consideration, any project proposal presented to the ERSE must target the following&#13;
beneficiary groups:&#13;
* internally displaced persons and refugees who left their homes and communities due to the&#13;
war and/or subsequent civil strife that resulted from junta rule and its aftermath;&#13;
*   people in war-affected villages who never moved but are taking initiatives to re-establish&#13;
themselves and their communities as well as people returning spontaneously to their villages&#13;
from displaced camps, bush camps and other areas;&#13;
*   vulnerable groups, such as female headed households; children affected by the conflict&#13;
through war trauma, being orphaned, or disrupted schooling; and disabled people, including&#13;
those severely injured or traumatised by the war;&#13;
e ex-combatants and their dependants; and&#13;
* urban unemployed living in the poorest areas of Freetown, Makeni, Bo, and Kenema.&#13;
3.5 Financial Restrictions&#13;
The following budget restrictions and financial guidelines will govern ERSF projects:&#13;
*  no project budget and supported activities should exceed 12 months duration, nor go beyond&#13;
the 3-year mandate of the Commission;&#13;
*   a maximum funding limit of approximately Le.850,000,000 (US$500,000) per project will&#13;
apply;&#13;
*   at any given time, the ERSF will not provide funding to an organisation in excess of 50% of&#13;
the organisation's previous year's annual budget;&#13;
*   only allowable cost categories (as defined in the proposal development guidelines) will be&#13;
considered for financing under the ERSF;&#13;
*  no counter-part funds are required of implementing partners; however, community in-kind&#13;
contributions will be encouraged for community infrastructure projects (clinics, schools,&#13;
etc.);&#13;
* up to a maximum of 20% of the total ERSF proposed project budget will be allowed for&#13;
"organisational" costs including administrative costs, overheads, general equipment which&#13;
would not directly benefit the community, etc.; and&#13;
* purchase of large assets such as institutional infrastructure, vehicles, etc. will be&#13;
discouraged, and the disposition of any vehicles upon project completion will be the subject&#13;
of negotiation between NCRRR and the implementing partner.&#13;
4. Technical Evaluation Criteria&#13;
Once a project and organization are shown to meet the basic eligibility criteria listed above, projects&#13;
submitted to the ERSF will be reviewed and evaluated based on two sets of technical criteria, general and&#13;
specific.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex                                           Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;
Sierra Leone                                                            Attachment 11: Page 6 of l3&#13;
4.1 General Criteria&#13;
General criteria will be applied to each project proposal by the ERSF secretariat staff (see sections 5.1&#13;
and 5.2) in assessing overall project design and fundability. This assessment would look at institutional,&#13;
financial, social and environmental criteria, project coherence, and sustainability. These categories of&#13;
criteria are described in more detail below.&#13;
Institutional criteria; including number and types of personnel, available infrastructure and physical&#13;
resources to carry out project, financial management and administrative systems, years and types of&#13;
experience, project value relative to overall organizational finances, etc.&#13;
Project coherence; including relation between identified problems, causes and proposed solutions, the&#13;
clarity and specificity of project objectives and links to proposed project activities, feasibility of&#13;
achieving the proposed end results, completeness and reasonability of the monitoring plan, and the&#13;
innovativeness or creativity of the project design.&#13;
Financial criteria; including a clear relation between project activities and budget items,&#13;
reasonableness of proposed inputs and unit costs, inputs conform with standard specifications and&#13;
applicable market rates, budget form and substance in agreement with guidelines (no unacceptable&#13;
expenditure categories, adequate information, etc.), and the relative level of "direct" and "indirect"&#13;
costs.&#13;
Sustainability criteria; including level and substance of community participation in project planning&#13;
and implementation, level of local knowledge or skills required for implementation, level of local&#13;
labor and/or materials in project, level of operation or maintenance costs once project is complete,&#13;
viability of maintenance plan, impact on disposable time of women, income generating potential of&#13;
project, and effect project has on environment and natural resources.&#13;
Social criteria; including understanding of ethnic characteristics of community and region, impact on&#13;
vulnerable groups, and potential conflicts or obstacles between different groups or institutions within&#13;
community.&#13;
Environmental criteria; including identification and mitigation of potential environmental impacts of&#13;
the proposed projects, in particular issues related to health and sanitation, natural resource&#13;
exploitation and pesticide use.&#13;
This review will be carried out by ERSF/NCRRR staff in the offices and at the proposed sites of the&#13;
implementing partners. Clearly, the larger, more complex and more costly the project, the more detailed&#13;
and thorough the general technical review will be. In particular, the regional and district level staff of&#13;
NCRRR should assess the extent to which the project reflects the priorities of the community in which the&#13;
project will be implemented.&#13;
4.2 Specific Technical Criteria&#13;
Suitable line ministries and technical sub-committees (as appropriate) in each region will conduct specific&#13;
technical evaluations of each proposal. It will be the responsibility of these groups to apply appropriate&#13;
technical criteria to the project review; such criteria will vary depending on the project type (i.e.,&#13;
agriculture, infrastructure, basic services, or enterprise development). In general, however, these sub-&#13;
committees or task forces would look at the following areas in making a technical assessment of the&#13;
project:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex                                       Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;

*   demonstrated understanding of the factors and technical conditions influencing the project&#13;
and beneficiary groups;&#13;
*   conformity with standard technical specifications, norms or practices for the particular sector&#13;
under consideration (such as road specifications, standard building designs, or health&#13;
treatment protocols);&#13;
*   technical soundness and adequacy of the proposed solutions (i.e., will the problem be&#13;
resolved with the level and extent of input and assistance proposed), and if the project&#13;
objectives are realistic and achievable;&#13;
*   technical skills, knowledge and capacity of implementing agency/staff; and&#13;
*   use of proven and appropriate technical practices or methods.&#13;
5. ERSF Structures and Procedures&#13;
Administration of the ERSF is distinguished by two important features; a decentralized management&#13;
structure, and a shared responsibility between NCRRR and its implementing partners (NGOs, line&#13;
ministries, etc.) in both the administration and implementation of the Fund.&#13;
The NCRRR has final responsibility for the ERSF and reports to its funding agencies on overall resource&#13;
use and achievements under the Fund. Implementing partners contracted by NCRRR and working at the&#13;
local level will carry out day-to-day implementation of project activities. These partners report directly to&#13;
district and regional offtces of NCRRR, which will monitor the Fund. An inter-agency ERSF Projects&#13;
Committee will be established in each provincial capital to review, approve, or recommend all ERSF&#13;
projects proposed for that region. A central level ERSF Projects Committee will also be set up to review&#13;
all projects exceeding the regional project approval threshold of US$50,000.  The central level&#13;
Committee will also take responsibility for approving and monitoring all Western Area project proposals.&#13;
District Supervisors and Community Development Officers will serve as outreach staff for the&#13;
Commission at the district level. These staff will be responsible for co-ordination and information&#13;
exchange with district-level government representatives (especially line ministries); facilitating NCRRR&#13;
linkages with village leaders, section heads and paramount chiefs; encouraging the participation of local&#13;
groups and communities in the ERSF; and monitoring the work of implementing partners.&#13;
The central-level Commission will have responsibility for overall financial management of the ERSF,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of ERSF and NRRRP implementation, setting and revising ERSF policy, and&#13;
co-ordination of implementing partners at the national level.&#13;
5.1 Relevant ERSF Structures&#13;
There are six structures, four at regional levels and two at the center, which will share the responsibility&#13;
for the successful implementation of the Fund. These structures are (i) the regional ERSF Projects&#13;
Committee, (ii) the ERSF technical secretariat within the Regional NCRRR office, (iii) the regional Inter-&#13;
agency Forum, (iv) the technical committees or task forces operating in each region, (v) the National&#13;
ERSF Projects Committee, and (vi) the Financial Management and Procurement Unit. Each body and its&#13;
overall responsibilities are described below.&#13;
The ERSF Projects Committee will be established and given the responsibility for reviewing and&#13;
approving projects up to the threshold level of $US 50,000, equivalent.1 This Committee will be&#13;
During the pilot phase of the ERSF (the first six-months of operation), all projects above US$25,000 equivalent will also&#13;
require the approval of the National ERSF Projects Committee in Freetown.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex                                           Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;
Sierra Leone                                                            Attachment II: Page 8 of 13&#13;
composed of 2 NCRRR staff (the Regional Co-ordinator and one other staff member2) the HACU&#13;
regional officer, the regional MOFDEP representative, and one representative of the implementing&#13;
partners who will be nominated by the Inter-agency Forum.3 The Regional Co-ordinator will chair the&#13;
Committee.4&#13;
The ERSF technical secretariat, consisting of two projects officers and one finance officer, will be set up&#13;
in each region and will be responsible for the day-to-day administrative tasks associated with ERSF&#13;
project applications, reviews, and approvals. While the secretariat is responsible to. the Projects&#13;
Committee, on a day-to-day basis these staff will report to the NCRRR Regional Co-ordinator.&#13;
The Regional Inter-agency Forum will provide broad-based, multi-sectoral and inter-agency feedback to&#13;
the project approval and monitoring process. This body is chaired by the NCRRR Regional Co-ordinator&#13;
and serves as the forum for general information exchange and identification of potential problems or&#13;
conflicts in ERSF project design and implementation. All proposed projects will be presented to this&#13;
body before detailed review by NCRRR staff and the appropriate technical body so as to draw upon the&#13;
collective knowledge of the broader development community in the regions. Membership in this forum is&#13;
open to all interested parties and potential implementing partners throughout the region.&#13;
Technical Sub-committees. As neither the ERSF Projects Committee nor the technical secretariat will&#13;
have all the information or technical know-how to assess all types of proposals, existing, or newly&#13;
formed, technical sub-committees or task-forces5 will be called upon to review specific technical aspects&#13;
of project proposals. The NCRRR Regional Co-ordinator will seek the cooperation of the relevant&#13;
technical committees or ad hoc groups through the appropriate line ministry or public authority (such as&#13;
SLRA), and will have access to necessary resources to facilitate individual and committee members input&#13;
to this process.&#13;
A National ERSF Projects Committee will be formed at central level to: (i) make recommendations on all&#13;
sub-project approvals for contracts which exceed the regional approval threshold of US$50,000, (ii)&#13;
review and approve all urban public works projects that target the unemployed of Greater Freetown, and&#13;
(iii) review and approve all project proposals that are national in scope such as those presented by central&#13;
level line ministries. The National Committee will be chaired by the NCRRR Director for RRR, and will&#13;
include the Director for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; the Director of the SAPA Program; a&#13;
representative for the Development Department of MOFDEP; a representative of UN/OCHA, and one&#13;
representative of the donors that support the ERSF.&#13;
The Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) will be established to assist NCRRR with all&#13;
aspects of contracting, disbursements, financial management and reporting in relation to the ERSF, as&#13;
well as other donor financed activities within the Commission. Once an ERSF project is approved and&#13;
contracts are signed by the Commission, the FMPU will manage all direct payments made to&#13;
implementing partners and will ensure that financial reporting and record keeping is in line with GOSL&#13;
and donor requirements, and internationally accepted accounting standards. The table below indicates the&#13;
main characteristics and responsibilities of these ERSF structures.&#13;
2 During the pilot phase, the second NCRRR person will be a headquarters staff to ensure proper implementation of ERSF&#13;
procedures and to help build the capacity of the regional committees and review process.&#13;
3 The IAF will nominate I representative and I alternate so as to avoid any conflict of interest in the event that a proposal is&#13;
submitted by the IAF representative's implementing organization.&#13;
4 The feasibility of including a beneficiary representative on the Projects Committee will be considered as part of the six-month&#13;
review of the ERSF pilot phase.&#13;
5 Such as the Regional Technical Committee on Food Aid, Regional Agriculture Committee, or Regional Health and Nutrition&#13;
Committee.&#13;

procedures&#13;
reports to Commissioner on use of all donor funding and ensures&#13;
finds used in accordance with internationally accepted-standards&#13;
5.2 Project Review &amp; Approval Procedures&#13;
Project Development. Potential implementing partners should first contact NCRRR to receive appropriate&#13;
guidance in preparing a proposal. For this purpose, NCRRR has developed guidelines and standard&#13;
formats to assist implementing partners in the proposal development process. While information will be&#13;
available at all NCRRR central, regional, and district offices, partners are encouraged to contact the&#13;
appropriate regional or district levels office nearest the point where project will be implemented.&#13;
Potential implementing partners will present their project idea, or concept, to the Inter-agency Forum for&#13;
review and comment prior to submission of a full proposal. This review is designed to ensure better co-&#13;
ordination of development activities in the region, and to identify any potential problems or concerns in&#13;
the design of the project. The implementing partner will be encouraged to present the project concept to&#13;
the IAF directly, however, if an organization cannot be present at the IAF meeting, NCRRR staff (either&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Sierra Leone                                                     Attachment 11: Page 10 of 13&#13;
district or regional) can present the project concept on behalf of the implementing partner. NCRRR will&#13;
develop a standard form that implementing partners can use to prepare and submit this brief project&#13;
summary to the ERSF project officer at the regional NCRRR office. The project officer would then&#13;
determine when the summary would be presented to the IAF based on the volume and backlog of&#13;
proposals, and the other duties of the IAF.&#13;
A project concept must be reviewed by the L4F before it can be consideredfor funding by NCRRR&#13;
Once the IAF has reviewed and commented upon a project idea, an implementing partner can present a&#13;
full project proposal to NCRRR taking into consideration any comments or concerns raised by the 1AF.&#13;
Project proposals should be submitted directly to the NCRRR regional office, however, district and&#13;
chiefdom based organizations might submit proposals to NCRRR through the district offices if more&#13;
convenient. District staff will have no direct responsibility for reviewing proposals, however, and will&#13;
transmit all proposals (and project concepts) directly to the regional office.&#13;
An NGO or CBO mustfill out an "NGO Profile"form and submit it to NCRRR before it is eligiblefor&#13;
funding under the ERSF.&#13;
Proposal Review. Project proposal review will be the main responsibility of the ERSF secretariat staff&#13;
(the Projects and Finance officers at the regional NCRRR office). These staff will first ensure that a&#13;
project and the applicant organization meet basic eligibility criteria as indicated in section 3 above. At&#13;
this same time, the ERSF secretariat staff will verify that any comments or concerns raised by the IAF&#13;
have been taken into consideration in the project proposal. If a project or organization is found to be&#13;
ineligible based on the basic criteria of the ERSF, or if the issues raised by the IAF have not been&#13;
addressed or clarified, the proposal will be returned to the proposing organization with a letter explaining&#13;
why the project could not be considered for funding.&#13;
Once found to be eligible, the Projects and Finance Officer of the regional NCRRR offices will carry out&#13;
a general technical review of projects and organizations using the criteria discussed in section 4.1 above.&#13;
This review will assess the institutional capacity to carry out the project, the project design, financial&#13;
aspects of the project, project sustainability, and the environmental impact of the project. NCRRR has&#13;
developed detailed forms that will be used in the application of these criteria to make the review of&#13;
project concepts and organizations efficient and objective.&#13;
Technical working groups (sub-committee, task force, or ad hoc body) will also conduct a specific&#13;
technical assessment of a proposed project. This will be done to ensure that proposals meet standard&#13;
technical specifications or norms for the particular sector in which the project is proposed.&#13;
The ERSF secretariat will send the proposal to the appropriate government line Ministry or technical&#13;
authority to co-ordinate and take responsibility for specific technical reviews of ERSF proposals.&#13;
As a part of the overall review process, ERSF secretariat and technical working group members should&#13;
visit both the implementing agency's office and the proposed project site to assess and apply the various&#13;
review criteria.&#13;
The ERSF secretariat will have a maximum of 15 working days from the time a proposal is submitted to&#13;
carry out the basic and general technical review of projects. A technical sub-committee will be required&#13;
to review and respond to the specific technical issues of a project proposal within 5 days of receipt of the&#13;
proposal (or specific technical questions) from NCRRR. The sub-committee will review project&#13;
proposals to determine their technical viability, propose modifications (if any) and indicate their&#13;
recommendation of the project on technical grounds. Member or members of the sub-committee will be&#13;
able to visit the site of a project or the offices of an applicant agency in reviewing the proposal. The&#13;
&#13;

Environmental Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Environment (MAFE)&#13;
will assist NCRRR with any sub-projects for which environmental concerns require further review and&#13;
analysis. NCRRR regional offices will make appropriate resources (e.g. supplies, logistics, trek&#13;
allowances, etc.) available to the technical sub-committee members to ensure adequate and timely action&#13;
(including MAFE environmental assessments).&#13;
Project Approval. Recommendations from both the ERSF secretariat and respective sub-committee will&#13;
be consolidated by the Project Officers and passed on to the ERSF Projects Committee. This Committee&#13;
will meet fortnightly to review the technical recommendations and decide to either approve or reject a&#13;
project proposal, up to a threshold of US$50,000, equivalent. For projects above this threshold, the&#13;
regional ERSF Projects Committee may either reject the project orrecommend a proposal to the central&#13;
level for approval. Therefore, a National ERSF Projects Committee will be formed and be given the&#13;
authority to approve projects over US$50,000. This committee will be composed of the NCRRR Director&#13;
of RRR (chair); the Director of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; the Director of the SAPA Program;&#13;
one representative from the Development Department of MOFDEP; and one representative from&#13;
UN/OCHA.&#13;
NCRRR will be managing different sources of funding from different donor agencies. Nonetheless, it is&#13;
hoped that the procedures presented here can be applied to the greatest extent possible to all outside&#13;
funding. However, early in the approval process, the Commission will determine which funding&#13;
mechanism at its disposal would be the most appropriate for a given project. By so doing, NCRRR can&#13;
then take appropriate internal administrative action to seek any special approvals for different&#13;
programmes (such as SAPA) or funding agencies to reduce the need for different external procedures or&#13;
requirements of potential implementing partners.&#13;
5.3 Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Contracting. Once a project has been approved, the ERSF Projects Officer in each region will prepare&#13;
the contract for signature based on a standard contract format and required attachments. The contract will&#13;
include a summary description of the project, a detailed implementation plan, project budget and&#13;
disbursement schedule, and customized forms for physical and financial progress reporting. Either the&#13;
Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of NCRRR will sign all contracts.&#13;
Disbursements and Financial Control. The Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) of&#13;
the NCRRR will disburse funds to the implementing partners for project activities once the Commission&#13;
has authorized the contract. All disbursements will be made based on monthly financial reports, adequate&#13;
documentation of claimed expenditures, and periodic requests for payment submitted by implementing&#13;
partners to the regional ERSF Finance Officers. Implementing partners will submit monthly reports and&#13;
associated documentation to the Finance Officers no latter than 10 days after the close of the preceding&#13;
month. These reports and requests for payment will be reviewed and consolidated at regional level and&#13;
sent to the FMPU for final review and payment processing. The same consolidated report is sent to the&#13;
ERSF Projects Committee for monitoring purposes. In the event of any questions or concerns raised by&#13;
the regional Finance Officers, the Projects Committee, and/or the FMPU, NCRRR staffs will follow-up&#13;
directly with the implementing partners.&#13;
All financial reporting and disbursement requests will be carried out per the terms of contract between the&#13;
Commission and the implementing partners, and all forms for such transactions will be provided to the&#13;
implementing partners as attachments to the standard contract. Unless issues or questions arise regarding&#13;
reported expenditures and the status of outstanding balances, payments will be made to implementing&#13;
partners within 20 days of financial report submission and request for payment.&#13;
&#13;

NCRRR will require that all projects valued at more than $50,000, equivalent, be audited by an&#13;
independent public accounting firm. The audit should include a review of the contractual obligations and&#13;
restrictions for the ERSF project. If an implementing partner already conducts annual external audits of&#13;
its project activities, then this audit will be adequate for NCRRR and ERSF purposes, provided that it also&#13;
reviews the contractual obligations of the implementing partner. The incremental costs for such audit will&#13;
be an allowable expense under the ERSF project activity. If a project is valued at less than $50,000,&#13;
equivalent, and if the implementing partner does not have an independent audit of their accounts&#13;
conducted annually, NCRRR will require that all original vouchers for all expenses claimed under ERSF&#13;
be submitted to NCRRR as part of the monthly financial report. Otherwise, copies of invoices and&#13;
vouchers should be presented with the financial reports.&#13;
To further guarantee adequate financial control, the Internal Control Unit of the FMPU will be authorized&#13;
to carry out spot checks of ERSF project expenditures reported by implementing partners. Finally, the&#13;
semi-annual audits of the overall NCRRR operations will also include a random testing of ERSF project&#13;
activities and expenditures.&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting. Implementing partners will be required to submit monthly technical reports&#13;
to NCRRR that quantify project outputs and quarterly narrative progress reports providing details of&#13;
project progress and constraints. Two copies of each report will be submitted to NCRRR; one will go to&#13;
the District Supervisor where the project activities are being implemented, and one will go to the&#13;
Regional Co-ordinator for the appropriate region. As with the financial reports, these technical progress&#13;
reports will be submitted to NCRRR within 10 days of the close of the reporting period. Customized&#13;
formats for reporting technical progress will be designed and made available to implementing partners as&#13;
attachments to the standard ERSF project contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

District Supervisors will receive the reports and be responsible for verifying the information presented&#13;
through regular communications with the implementing partners and field visits to the project sites. The&#13;
project officers at regional level will review and consolidate the progress reports for all active projects in&#13;
the region. The regional office will have responsibility for entering physical progress data into a&#13;
computerized monitoring system. A consolidated report on all regional projects will be prepared by the&#13;
project officer and presented to the Projects Committee for review and discussion. A copy of the same&#13;
report will be sent to the relevant line ministries in the region. The consolidated report and the electronic&#13;
data will also be sent to the Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation at the central-level&#13;
Commission for further consolidation and analysis. The M&amp;E unit at the central Commission will&#13;
prepare a quarterly progress report on the overall implementation of the ERSF.&#13;
5.4 Public Sector Institutions&#13;
The relevant technical departments, regional, and district offices of the line ministries of the GOSL have&#13;
an important role to fulfil in the implementation of the ERSF. First, relevant line ministries (i.e., health,&#13;
education, agriculture, works, etc.) are all potential implementing partners to the ERSF. The Commission&#13;
fully expects that the appropriate technical units and offices of these ministries will be active participants&#13;
in the development and implementation of projects. NCRRR expects to have certain core support&#13;
resources available to assist regional and district ministry offices fully participate in the ERSF. Secondly,&#13;
the technical ministries will play a critical role at the regional level in providing guidance and input to the&#13;
ERSF project staff and Projects Committee.  NCRRR  recognizes the technical expertise and&#13;
responsibility that the line ministries have in guaranteeing adherence to sectoral standards and norms.&#13;
Therefore, technical sub-committees at the regional level (many that already exist) will be called upon to&#13;
provide specific technical know-how and advise on given project proposals. The senior technical officer&#13;
from the relevant line ministry or parastatal body will be the contact person for the NCRRR in order to&#13;
co-ordinate appropriate technical reviews of ERSF project proposals. NCRRR will make available to&#13;
sub-committee members or specified technical personnel in the regions adequate logistical support to&#13;
facilitate these technical reviews of proposals. Finally, NCRRR will rely on the line ministry departments&#13;
to help monitor project implementation-- especially regarding technical specifications and norms.&#13;
District level NCRRR staff responsible for monitoring ERSF project implementation will be responsible&#13;
for securing the close co-ordination of line ministry personnel at the same level when specific technical&#13;
matters of project implementation are being considered.&#13;
Given the special nature of the line ministry departments as the co-ordinator of all national activities for&#13;
their respective sectors, and as the regulating body in terms of technical norms and procedures, the&#13;
process whereby the line ministries apply to and are financed under the ERSF will vary slightly. First,&#13;
any project submitted by a district or regional line ministry office must be endorsed by the appropriate&#13;
central ministry department. Second, in the event of a national level project activity (such as for an&#13;
information campaign, staff training, etc.), the proposal to the ERSF would be submitted directly to&#13;
NCRRR at the central level, and would be reviewed by the National ERSF Projects Committee. Third,&#13;
fund disbursement for activities implemented through line ministry departments would have to be&#13;
consistent with the financial management requirements of the Government, as well as abide by the&#13;
procedures of the FMPU.&#13;
Any and all questions regarding the ERSF should be directed to the nearest district or regional NCRRR office (in&#13;
Bo, Makeni, Kenema, or the district headquarters towns). Those organizations based in Freetown may seek&#13;
information on the ERSF from the central office of the Commission (39 Siaka Stevens Street, tel: 226032) however,&#13;
proposals should be submitted through the office nearest to the point where the project would be implemented.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Assessment of the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Pilot Phase&#13;
Background&#13;
The Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project (CRRP) and the related Emergency Recovery&#13;
Support Fund (ERSF), and Training and Employment Program (TEP) are Government of Sierra Leone&#13;
initiatives co-ordinated by the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation&#13;
(NCRRR) and the National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR) to&#13;
help address the negative social and economic affects of more than seven years of civil war and ten&#13;
months of junta rule. The Commission and Committee have been charged with the responsibility of&#13;
helping rebuild the country and will do so in collaboration with key donor and implementing partner&#13;
organisations. Several donor organisations, including the World Bank, the African Development Bank,&#13;
and the UNDP, support the efforts of these Government institutions to address the urgent needs of&#13;
resettling displaced people and refugees, restoring basic social services and infrastructure in the war&#13;
affected areas, reintegrating ex-combatants, and addressing the needs of peace building and&#13;
reconciliation. The CRRP also supports labour-intensive public works activities designed to assist the&#13;
most vulnerable members of society.&#13;
The CRRP finances community based sub-projects which address the priority needs of internally&#13;
displaced persons, refugees, former combatants, and other vulnerable groups in both rural and urban&#13;
areas throughout the country. These sub-projects address multi-sectoral needs; starting with more urgent&#13;
food production and temporary shelter, and running through medium and longer term concerns for basic&#13;
infrastructure repair and rehabilitation of productive assets. The sub-projects are implemented by eligible&#13;
partners which include international and national NGOs, government line ministries, existing donor&#13;
project units, and qualified community based organisations. As the financial resources available through&#13;
CRRP can only begin to support the long process of rebuilding the country; the Project also looks to&#13;
catalysing the self-help efforts of each village and community.&#13;
The Project and the ERSF have been designed through a process of consultation, investigation, and&#13;
consensus-building initiated by the earlier Ministry of National Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and&#13;
Resettlement in mid-1996. The ERSF relies on a decentralised bottom-up project planning, approval and&#13;
monitoring process which taps into and builds upon existing systems and structures at the regional and&#13;
local levels. NGOs, line ministries and other entities develop project proposals in close collaboration&#13;
with village, section and chiefdom authorities. Regional NCRRR staff have primary responsibility for&#13;
day-to-day management of the project review process. Regional inter-agency committees have been&#13;
formed and given the responsibility to approve projects up to a maximum given level. NCRRR&#13;
headquarters' staff provide the broad policy and programme planning framework for the ERSF, monitor&#13;
its implementation and co-ordinate the overall process.&#13;
In anticipation of an IDA credit worth more than US$20 million, the World Bank is supporting NCRRR&#13;
and the ERSF to carry out pilot activities during latter 1998 and early 1999. More than 20 projects worth&#13;
almost US$1 million have been reviewed and approved, and have begun implementation under the&#13;
Bank's Project Preparation Facility. In light of the innovative nature of the Fund, and the high degree of&#13;
inter-agency collaboration and co-operation called for in it implementation, the Government and the&#13;
World Bank have decided that a detailed review of the ERSF is required before larger-scale&#13;
implementation begins. These terms of reference are for that review.&#13;
&#13;

implement adequate numbers of projects that are of appropriate quality;&#13;
B. Determine if any specific type of project, implementing partner, design or implementation strategy&#13;
works best (and worst) at achieving the overall goals of the Fund and the National RRR Programme;&#13;
C. Assess to what degree approved projects reflect the priorities of a broad cross-section of the&#13;
communities in which the projects are implemented.&#13;
Specific Tasks and Outputs&#13;
1.    Design an assessment strategy and tool(s) to evaluate the implementation of the ERSF that would&#13;
be reviewed by NCRRR.&#13;
2.    As appropriate, identify local partners and enter into agreement to assist with the implementation&#13;
of the assessment.&#13;

keeping and procurement.&#13;
9.    Assess NCRRR's performance in terms of financial and technical record keeping and project&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
10.   Conduct a workshop involving major stakeholders to the ERSF to discuss findings of the&#13;
assessment and to identify possible improvements to the ERSF review, approval and implementation&#13;
process.&#13;
11.   Prepare a final report to Government within 4 weeks of the conclusion of the assessment&#13;
recommending changes or adjustments to the ERSF and outlining a plan of action to put in place the&#13;
recommendations.&#13;

Social Safety Net Component of the CRRP&#13;
It has been agreed with Government that as part of the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;
Project (CRRP) a social safety net component would be implemented that would focus on labor-intensive&#13;
public works programs. The target beneficiaries of this temporary safety net would be ex-combatants,&#13;
unemployed urban youth, and members of recently returned rural communities, and other traditional&#13;
vulnerable groups such as female-headed households, etc. The safety net component will be operational&#13;
for the same three-year period that the CRRP will be effective.&#13;
After careful consideration of worldwide experiences with social safety net schemes, and consultations&#13;
with likely implementing partners and Government authorities responsible for relevant aspects of such an&#13;
intervention, the following observations and recommendations are made.&#13;
Project Design and Selection Criteria&#13;
1. Wage rate is the critical determinant of targeting as well as distribution of benefits in favor of poor&#13;
participants. In general, a wage that is close to or slightly below the prevailing market wage for&#13;
unskilled labor is most likely to encourage self-selection of the poor into the program, to maximize&#13;
the amount of temporary employment created under the program. Based on an assessment of current&#13;
market practices, related works programs managed by the Sierra Leonean Works Authority, and non-&#13;
governmental organizations' food-for-work activities, the prevailing daily rate is approximately&#13;
Le.1,500. This finding is roughly consistent with earlier findings of World Bank missions.&#13;
Therefore, it is recommended that the wage rate for the CRRP's social safety net component not&#13;
exceed this level.&#13;
2. Share of wages to total project cost. As the first objective of this component is to provide for&#13;
temporary employment opportunities for the identified vulnerable groups, the component should&#13;
strive to maximize the labor content of funded projects. Based on both reviews of proposed projects,&#13;
and experience in similar countries, the labor component of a projectI should represent&#13;
approximately 50% of the total cost. Therefore, a target range of 40 to 70 percent should be&#13;
recommended for the CRRP, depending on the type and location of a project. Projects with labor&#13;
costs above this range would not ensure adequate quality of the completed projects, and below this&#13;
range would not meet the objective of the program.&#13;
3. Geographic targeting. In order to make it easiest for the identified vulnerable groups to participate&#13;
in the component, and therefore reduce transaction costs, it is recommended that proposed activities&#13;
target those areas where there is general agreement that the concentration of poverty is greatest. For&#13;
instance, in Freetown such areas include Goderich, Congo Town/Banana Water areas, Dworzak&#13;
Farm, Redpump, Kroobay, OdokokolMountain Court, Mabella, Ginger Hall, and many pockets in&#13;
Kissy and Wellington. In addition, those rural communities that have recently returned home&#13;
(i.e., the majority of the population having arrived within the previous 12 months) should be targeted.&#13;
4. Other design features.  Project designs should include other features that facilitate broad&#13;
participation; for example, piece-rate or task-based payment, flexible timing of participation (where&#13;
possible), provision of day care arrangements, and timing not to conflict with other demands such as&#13;
planting season, or the school year for youths.&#13;
Labor costs directed at the target group or groups; i.e., excluding supervisory and/or management personnel costs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex                                        Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation&#13;
Sierra Leone                                                         Attachment 13: Page 2 of 4&#13;
Project Identification and Development&#13;
While the CRRP wishes to target those vulnerable groups identified for the social safety net component&#13;
of the Project, the overall implementation strategy of the CRRP is to use a community-based demand&#13;
driven project identification and development process. This same strategy is advisable for the social&#13;
safety net component for consistency sake and also to encourage that the social and/or economic&#13;
infrastructure created, rehabilitated or maintained through the public works activity is considered a&#13;
priority by the community that will ultimately use it.&#13;
Therefore, it is expected that NGOs, line ministries, or public authorities (such as SLRA) will prepare&#13;
project proposals through consultation with relevant communities and/or identified vulnerable groups.&#13;
By doing so, not only will the priorities of the community be better expressed in the project design, but&#13;
the ownership of the end-product greater-- thus encouraging on-going community maintenance of the&#13;
asset.&#13;
Project proposals must demonstrate that the requisite technical input, standards and/or norms have been&#13;
taken into consideration and that appropriate technical supervision will be available for project&#13;
implementation. For instance, road rehabilitation or maintenance activities should reflect the SLRA&#13;
norms and should cater for adequate monitoring, works rehabilitation proposals should have standard&#13;
drawings and bills of quantities attached (if appropriate), works involving sanitation, agriculture or&#13;
reforestation should indicate how the relevant line ministries (health and agriculture) have been consulted&#13;
in project design and will be involved in implementation.&#13;
Project Review and Selection&#13;
It is recommended that the proposed ERSF project review and approval procedures overseen by NCRRR&#13;
be used for the social safety net component of the CRRP. The same staff and organizational structures&#13;
are capable of handling these types of projects, and the inter-agency review process will help guarantee&#13;
both technical suitability of projects and coordination with other similar activities (such as food for work&#13;
or food for agriculture). Specific technical criteria (indicated below) should be incorporated into the&#13;
ERSF Operational Manual and be used in reviewing and assessing these types of public works projects.&#13;
Technical review and inter-agency approval structures have been established to assess and select&#13;
community based projects that are adequately suited to the task of reviewing labor-intensive works&#13;
projects. The recent revisions to the institutional structure of NCRRR that include adding a Western Area&#13;
office and seeking civil engineers for district level posts, will facilitate the inclusion of public works&#13;
project proposals in the review process. As with the ERSF, NCRRR is the coordinating institution and&#13;
financing channel for project activities; the actual implementing agencies will be the partner&#13;
organizations to the ERSF; namely NGOs, line ministries, and public authorities.&#13;
Specific Review Criteria&#13;
*   The component's priority should be to create temporary employment among the most vulnerable,&#13;
while at the same time optimizing the social, economic and/or physical infrastructure of the&#13;
community and, if possible, be oriented toward further job creation and/or income generation.&#13;
*   Project wage rate should not exceed the prevailing market wage for unskilled labor. At present,&#13;
the wage rate varies, depending on location. The average daily wage rate for unskilled labor is&#13;
approximately Le 1,500. The monthly wage for unskilled labor varies, between Le 35,000 and Le&#13;
45,000 (for 25 working days).&#13;
*   The total wage component for unskilled labor of the public works project should be equal to or&#13;
exceed 50 percent of the total project cost, on average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Depending on the type of public works and the location, wages could be paid in both cash and in-&#13;
kind (i.e., food), however, the total value should not exceed a daily wage rate of Le.1, 500 as&#13;
discussed above. Discussions between SLRA and NGOs, for instance, suggest that for the&#13;
implementation of all food-aid projects, 30% of the labor cost shall be paid in food and 70% in&#13;
cash.&#13;
*   The project encourages to create linkages between the proposed public works schemes and the&#13;
productivity with which the works are carried out, through incorporating a piece-rate or task-&#13;
based payment system for laborers. (SLRA's Feeder Roads Department, for instance, has&#13;
established wage rates per man-day for 18 different road rehabilitation activities).&#13;
*  Proposed public works projects need to be consistent with existing labor laws.&#13;
*   Proposed public works projects need to be technically feasible and proposals must demonstrate&#13;
that appropriate technical norms and design standards will be adhered to.&#13;
*   Targeted communities should participate in project design and the services or works to be&#13;
delivered should respond to the needs of these groups.&#13;
*   Timing and design of services/works should, to the extent possible, encourage broadest&#13;
participation and reduce opportunity costs of participation through seasonal timing (i.e., not&#13;
during the planting or harvesting seasons) and flexible working arrangements (such as piece meal&#13;
work).&#13;
*   The number of laborers at any one-job site should range between 50 and 75, and should not&#13;
exceed 100.&#13;
*   During the pilot phase of the ERSF, it is not recommended that any one public works project&#13;
exceed $150,000 in value.&#13;
*   The implementing partners proposing the public works projects need to ensure a reliable and&#13;
regular flow of funds for the payment of workers and put in place a financial management system&#13;
that promotes the expedient implementation of the works.&#13;
*   To the extent possible, proposed public works programs should be targeting communities where&#13;
there is general agreement that the concentration of poverty is greatest. In the initial phase of the&#13;
project, the identification of the poor will be based on geographic targeting. Priority will be given&#13;
to pockets of poor in urban areas and recently returned communities in rural areas. The needs of&#13;
particular vulnerable groups, such as ex-combatants, unemployed youth or female-headed&#13;
households, will be addressed through these broader geographically targeted programs.&#13;
Financing Modalities&#13;
The same financing procedures proposed for the overall ERSF should also apply to the social safety net&#13;
component of the CRRP. Namely, once a contract with an implementing partner is authorized by&#13;
NCRRR, the Financial Management and Procurement Unit will manage all financial disbursements to the&#13;
organization. The FMPU will be established as an autonomous unit reporting to NCRRR but which will&#13;
operate independently from normnal fund disbursement procedures of the public sector. Financial staff of&#13;
NCRRR at regional levels and in the Western Area will have responsibility for reviewing monthly&#13;
financial reports from implementing partners. It will be the responsibility of the implementing agencies&#13;
to guarantee timely disbursement of wages to laborers.&#13;
&#13;

Implementation Mechanisms&#13;
The mission met with various Government agencies and NGO organizations and was able to confirm the&#13;
conclusion of previous World Bank missions that considerable capacity exists in Sierra Leone, both in the&#13;
private sector and in the local and international NGO community, to carry out labor-intensive public&#13;
works programs. Since a recent CRRP mission, in May'98, several public works activities have been&#13;
initiated or are being prepared. WFP implementing partners alone will employ 78,000 people for food-&#13;
for-agriculture activities over a five-month period from May to September of the current year. NGOs like&#13;
CARE, CRS, and World Vision have also been implementing food-for-a.griculture programs during the&#13;
ongoing rainy season and are preparing food-for-work programs for the upcoming dry season. Certain&#13;
organizations are also contemplating cash-for-work programs. During recent discussions between the&#13;
government (SLRA) and some of its implementing partners (NGOs), agreement was reached that for the&#13;
implementation of all food-aid projects, 30% of the labor cost shall be paid in food and 70% in cash.&#13;
In addition, the Government is encouraging linkages between the proposed public works schemes and the&#13;
productivity with which the works are carried out. In particular, through incorporating a piece-rate or&#13;
task-based payment system for laborers. SLRA's Feeder Roads Department, for instance, has established&#13;
piece rates per man-day for 18 different road rehabilitation activities. To improve implementation&#13;
capacity in Moyamba, Bonthe and Pujehan districts, SLRA field staff and several small-scale contractors&#13;
are currently involved in refresher courses and skills upgrading training on emergency spot improvement&#13;
of feeder roads and bridges. The Ministry of Youth has prepared several public works proposals for urban&#13;
youth, and Civil Development Units have continued to mobilize urban youth to do voluntary work such&#13;
as garbage cleaning. These developments indicate a growing capacity to plan and implement public&#13;
works programs in both urban as well as rural Sierra Leone. The mission is of the opinion that for the&#13;
implementation of its Social Safety Net component, the CRRP can largely rely on this increasing&#13;
capacity.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
The established procedures and mechanisms in place for monitoring the ERSF will be used to monitor the&#13;
labor-intensive works activities.  Specifically, district level staff (supervisors and community&#13;
development officers) and the Western Area manager and project officer will monitor specific indicators&#13;
of progress. These will include timely payment of wages, level of employment created (man-days),&#13;
timely completion of works, and quality of works. In assessing the latter two aspects of the physical&#13;
works carried out, NCRRR staff will seek the assistance of the Government line ministries and public&#13;
authorities as necessary.&#13;

            Sierra Leone - Community Reintegration and
            Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Community Reintegration and
            Rehabilitation Project aims to contribute to increased
            security, social stability, and economic revival by helping
            former combatants and the population and communities
            affected by the conflict return to normal, productive lives.
            The number of potential beneficiaries is estimated to reach
            1.5 million, close to one third of the population. The
            project is expected to have a significant impact on reducing
            war-induced poverty throughout Sierra Leone, particularly by
            helping reinvigorate the local economy. The project will
            entail two components: 1) Emergency Recovery Support Fund,
            and related institutional support to the National Commission
            for Reconstruction, Resettlement, and Rehabilitation and
            partners will facilitate the social and economic recovery of
            communities and the restoration of basic social and economic
            services through demand-driven, community-oriented projects
            that target individuals, groups and the community affected
            by the conflict. 2) Training and Employment Program, and
            related institutional support to the National Committee on
            Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration will support
            the social and economic reintegration of former combatants
            through targeted counseling, training, and employment
            creation efforts.
