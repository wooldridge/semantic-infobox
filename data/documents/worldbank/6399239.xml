        <abstracts>
            Land markets that allow access to
            land-and to buildings-through secure property rights, at
            transparent prices, and with efficient permitting processes
            and land tax systems are essential to a good business
            environment. Creating such markets, however, can be a long,
            complex, politically charged process, especially where most
            land is untitled and where there are conflicting claims. But
            experience points to practical interim or step solutions
            that can have a positive impact and generate the political
            capital to reform the overall land market system.
