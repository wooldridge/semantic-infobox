Conceptualizing	&#13; Â Transparency	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â Accountability	&#13; Â &#13;
	&#13; Â &#13;
A	&#13; Â  broad	&#13; Â  international	&#13; Â  consensus	&#13; Â  has	&#13; Â  developed	&#13; Â  around	&#13; Â  incorporating	&#13; Â  four	&#13; Â  key	&#13; Â &#13;
principles	&#13; Â  â&#128;&#147;	&#13; Â  accountability,	&#13; Â  transparency,	&#13; Â  participation	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  inclusion	&#13; Â  â&#128;&#147;	&#13; Â  into	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â &#13;

recent	&#13; Â  years.	&#13; Â  Carothers	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  Brechenmacher	&#13; Â  (2014)	&#13; Â  argue	&#13; Â  that	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  emergent	&#13; Â &#13;
consensus	&#13; Â  began	&#13; Â  in	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  1990s	&#13; Â  with	&#13; Â  an	&#13; Â  â&#128;&#156;opening	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  politicsâ&#128;&#157;	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  notion	&#13; Â  that	&#13; Â &#13;

	&#13; Â &#13;
Transparency	&#13; Â  has	&#13; Â  been	&#13; Â  characterized	&#13; Â  in	&#13; Â  many	&#13; Â  ways,	&#13; Â  but	&#13; Â  there	&#13; Â  is	&#13; Â  no	&#13; Â  standard	&#13; Â &#13;
definition.	&#13; Â Typically,	&#13; Â usage	&#13; Â of	&#13; Â the	&#13; Â term	&#13; Â points	&#13; Â to	&#13; Â transparency	&#13; Â involving	&#13; Â some	&#13; Â form	&#13; Â &#13;
of	&#13; Â  access	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  information	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  may	&#13; Â  also	&#13; Â  stipulate	&#13; Â  that	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  information	&#13; Â  must	&#13; Â  be	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â &#13;
sufficient	&#13; Â scope,	&#13; Â quality	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â timeliness	&#13; Â (Bellver	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â Kaufmann	&#13; Â 2005)	&#13; Â As	&#13; Â a	&#13; Â metaphor,	&#13; Â &#13;
it	&#13; Â  serves	&#13; Â  as	&#13; Â  a	&#13; Â  public	&#13; Â  value	&#13; Â  that	&#13; Â  citizens	&#13; Â  demand	&#13; Â  from	&#13; Â  government	&#13; Â  (Ball	&#13; Â  2009;	&#13; Â &#13;
Greiling	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  Spraul	&#13; Â  2010).	&#13; Â  It	&#13; Â  can	&#13; Â  be	&#13; Â  understood	&#13; Â  as	&#13; Â  an	&#13; Â  institutional	&#13; Â  relation	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â &#13;
monitoring	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â oversight,	&#13; Â as	&#13; Â information	&#13; Â exchange	&#13; Â over	&#13; Â decisions	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â actions,	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â &#13;
as	&#13; Â a	&#13; Â means	&#13; Â of	&#13; Â understanding	&#13; Â how	&#13; Â governments	&#13; Â work	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â what	&#13; Â they	&#13; Â achieve	&#13; Â (Meijer	&#13; Â &#13;
2013,	&#13; Â 430;	&#13; Â Heald	&#13; Â 2006,	&#13; Â 30).	&#13; Â 	&#13; Â &#13;
	&#13; Â &#13;
Similarly,	&#13; Â accountability	&#13; Â has	&#13; Â a	&#13; Â number	&#13; Â of	&#13; Â different	&#13; Â definitions,	&#13; Â including	&#13; Â many	&#13; Â that	&#13; Â &#13;
use	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  same	&#13; Â  or	&#13; Â  similar	&#13; Â  terminology	&#13; Â  (e.g.,	&#13; Â  â&#128;&#156;hierarchical	&#13; Â  accountabilityâ&#128;&#157;)	&#13; Â  in	&#13; Â  quite	&#13; Â &#13;
different	&#13; Â ways	&#13; Â (Migliorisi	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â Wescott	&#13; Â 2011).	&#13; Â This	&#13; Â paper	&#13; Â uses	&#13; Â accountability	&#13; Â in	&#13; Â the	&#13; Â &#13;
sense	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  process	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  holding	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  account,	&#13; Â  overseeing	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  keeping	&#13; Â  in	&#13; Â  check	&#13; Â  those	&#13; Â &#13;
persons	&#13; Â  who	&#13; Â  are	&#13; Â  entrusted	&#13; Â  with	&#13; Â  public	&#13; Â  responsibilities	&#13; Â  in	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  fulfillment	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  their	&#13; Â &#13;
tasks	&#13; Â  or	&#13; Â  functions	&#13; Â  (see	&#13; Â  Schedler	&#13; Â  1999;	&#13; Â  Migliorisi	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  Wescott	&#13; Â  2011),	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  focuses	&#13; Â  on	&#13; Â &#13;

government	&#13; Â  accountable	&#13; Â  through	&#13; Â  transparency,	&#13; Â  but	&#13; Â  whatever	&#13; Â  transmission	&#13; Â &#13;
mechanism	&#13; Â (i.e.,	&#13; Â the	&#13; Â â&#128;&#152;long-Â­â&#128;&#144;routeâ&#128;&#153;	&#13; Â or	&#13; Â the	&#13; Â â&#128;&#152;short-Â­â&#128;&#144;routeâ&#128;&#153;	&#13; Â to	&#13; Â accountability;	&#13; Â see	&#13; Â Devarajan	&#13; Â &#13;

	&#13; Â &#13;
Transparency	&#13; Â  is	&#13; Â  an	&#13; Â  element	&#13; Â  in	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  ecosystem	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  accountability.	&#13; Â  Transparency,	&#13; Â  along	&#13; Â &#13;
with	&#13; Â  enforcement,	&#13; Â  allows	&#13; Â  citizens,	&#13; Â  markets	&#13; Â  or	&#13; Â  governments	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  hold	&#13; Â  institutions	&#13; Â &#13;
accountable	&#13; Â  for	&#13; Â  their	&#13; Â  policies	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  performance	&#13; Â  (Bellver	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  Kaufmann	&#13; Â  2015).	&#13; Â 	&#13; Â &#13;
According	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  Florini	&#13; Â  (1999),	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  purpose	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  transparency	&#13; Â  is	&#13; Â  â&#128;&#156;the	&#13; Â  release	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â &#13;
information	&#13; Â by	&#13; Â institutions	&#13; Â that	&#13; Â is	&#13; Â relevant	&#13; Â to	&#13; Â evaluating	&#13; Â those	&#13; Â institutions.â&#128;&#157;	&#13; Â While	&#13; Â it	&#13; Â &#13;
is	&#13; Â  possible	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  have	&#13; Â  transparency	&#13; Â  without	&#13; Â  accountability,	&#13; Â  effective	&#13; Â  operation	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â &#13;
accountability	&#13; Â  relies	&#13; Â  upon	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  availability	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  information,	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  thus	&#13; Â  it	&#13; Â  is	&#13; Â  difficult	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â &#13;
conceive	&#13; Â of	&#13; Â accountability	&#13; Â without	&#13; Â transparency.	&#13; Â 	&#13; Â 	&#13; Â &#13;

that	&#13; Â  it	&#13; Â  may	&#13; Â  be	&#13; Â  a	&#13; Â  case	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  â&#128;&#152;one	&#13; Â  step	&#13; Â  forward,	&#13; Â  two	&#13; Â  steps	&#13; Â  backwardsâ&#128;&#153;,	&#13; Â  as	&#13; Â  ICTs	&#13; Â  may	&#13; Â  not	&#13; Â &#13;

number	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  cases	&#13; Â  have	&#13; Â  made	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  task	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  gaining	&#13; Â  control	&#13; Â  over	&#13; Â  recorded	&#13; Â &#13;

Contra	&#13; Â the	&#13; Â general	&#13; Â trend,	&#13; Â almost	&#13; Â from	&#13; Â the	&#13; Â outset	&#13; Â of	&#13; Â the	&#13; Â e-Â­â&#128;&#144;Government	&#13; Â wave,	&#13; Â Richard	&#13; Â &#13;

           Where	&#13; Â public	&#13; Â managers	&#13; Â lack	&#13; Â a	&#13; Â clear	&#13; Â records	&#13; Â management	&#13; Â strategy,	&#13; Â &#13;

           paper	&#13; Â  records-Â­â&#128;&#144;keeping.	&#13; Â  Yet	&#13; Â  computer	&#13; Â  records,	&#13; Â  because	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  their	&#13; Â  intangibility	&#13; Â &#13;
           and	&#13; Â malleability	&#13; Â are	&#13; Â a	&#13; Â far	&#13; Â poorer	&#13; Â basis	&#13; Â for	&#13; Â accountability	&#13; Â than	&#13; Â paper	&#13; Â records.	&#13; Â &#13;

notion	&#13; Â  that	&#13; Â  technology	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  digital	&#13; Â  information	&#13; Â  support	&#13; Â  transparency	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â &#13;
accountability	&#13; Â  and,	&#13; Â  therefore,	&#13; Â  can	&#13; Â  drive	&#13; Â  sustainable	&#13; Â  development:	&#13; Â  firstly,	&#13; Â  that	&#13; Â &#13;

have	&#13; Â  sufficient	&#13; Â  integrity	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  be	&#13; Â  able	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  support	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  goals	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  transparency	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â &#13;

establish	&#13; Â  a	&#13; Â  baseline	&#13; Â  picture	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  current	&#13; Â  state	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  records	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  information	&#13; Â &#13;

how	&#13; Â  such	&#13; Â  systems	&#13; Â  have	&#13; Â  been	&#13; Â  changed	&#13; Â  by	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  introduction	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  ICTs	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  what	&#13; Â  effect	&#13; Â &#13;

Conclusion	&#13; Â &#13;
	&#13; Â &#13;
This	&#13; Â paper	&#13; Â has	&#13; Â discussed	&#13; Â literature	&#13; Â on	&#13; Â the	&#13; Â unintended	&#13; Â consequences	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â downside	&#13; Â &#13;
risks	&#13; Â  associated	&#13; Â  with	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  way	&#13; Â  recorded	&#13; Â  information	&#13; Â  is	&#13; Â  produced	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  managed	&#13; Â  in	&#13; Â &#13;
digitally	&#13; Â  enabled	&#13; Â  public	&#13; Â  sector	&#13; Â  contexts,	&#13; Â  with	&#13; Â  particular	&#13; Â  focus	&#13; Â  on	&#13; Â  developing	&#13; Â &#13;
countries	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â the	&#13; Â international	&#13; Â development	&#13; Â agenda.	&#13; Â 	&#13; Â The	&#13; Â literature	&#13; Â has	&#13; Â been	&#13; Â drawn	&#13; Â &#13;
primarily	&#13; Â  from	&#13; Â  research	&#13; Â  conducted	&#13; Â  in	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  fields	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  records	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  information	&#13; Â &#13;
management	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â archival	&#13; Â administration,	&#13; Â as	&#13; Â well	&#13; Â as	&#13; Â from	&#13; Â research	&#13; Â on	&#13; Â transparency.	&#13; Â &#13;
Though	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  paper	&#13; Â  discusses	&#13; Â  a	&#13; Â  wide	&#13; Â  body	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  literature,	&#13; Â  it	&#13; Â  is	&#13; Â  not	&#13; Â  a	&#13; Â  bibliometric	&#13; Â &#13;
analysis	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  thus	&#13; Â  makes	&#13; Â  no	&#13; Â  claim	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  comprehensiveness	&#13; Â  or	&#13; Â  robust	&#13; Â  generalizable	&#13; Â &#13;
conclusions	&#13; Â  about	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  coverage	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  literature	&#13; Â  on	&#13; Â  this	&#13; Â  issue.	&#13; Â  Such	&#13; Â  a	&#13; Â  study	&#13; Â  is	&#13; Â  still	&#13; Â &#13;
needed.	&#13; Â  	&#13; Â  In	&#13; Â  addition,	&#13; Â  there	&#13; Â  is	&#13; Â  also	&#13; Â  a	&#13; Â  need	&#13; Â  for	&#13; Â  research	&#13; Â  that	&#13; Â  collects	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  analyzes	&#13; Â &#13;
comparative	&#13; Â  quantitative	&#13; Â  data	&#13; Â  about	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  effects	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  e-Â­â&#128;&#144;Government	&#13; Â  initiatives	&#13; Â  on	&#13; Â &#13;
records	&#13; Â  creation,	&#13; Â  use,	&#13; Â  management	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  preservation,	&#13; Â  and,	&#13; Â  by	&#13; Â  extension,	&#13; Â &#13;
transparency	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  accountability,	&#13; Â  as	&#13; Â  such	&#13; Â  research	&#13; Â  would	&#13; Â  support	&#13; Â  more	&#13; Â &#13;
generalizable	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  theoretically	&#13; Â  robust	&#13; Â  conclusions.	&#13; Â  Even	&#13; Â  based	&#13; Â  on	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  available	&#13; Â &#13;
evidence,	&#13; Â however,	&#13; Â it	&#13; Â is	&#13; Â possible	&#13; Â to	&#13; Â observe	&#13; Â that	&#13; Â the	&#13; Â introduction	&#13; Â of	&#13; Â ICTs	&#13; Â as	&#13; Â part	&#13; Â of	&#13; Â e-Â­â&#128;&#144;&#13;
Government	&#13; Â  initiatives	&#13; Â  has	&#13; Â had	&#13; Â unintended	&#13; Â consequences	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â introduced	&#13; Â downside	&#13; Â &#13;
risks	&#13; Â  for	&#13; Â  records	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  information	&#13; Â  management	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  preservation.	&#13; Â  These	&#13; Â  risks,	&#13; Â  in	&#13; Â &#13;
turn,	&#13; Â  have	&#13; Â  tended	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  undermine	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  evidence	&#13; Â  base	&#13; Â  needed	&#13; Â  for	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  operation	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â &#13;
effective	&#13; Â transparency	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â accountability	&#13; Â mechanisms	&#13; Â such	&#13; Â as	&#13; Â right	&#13; Â to	&#13; Â information	&#13; Â &#13;
regimes.	&#13; Â  	&#13; Â  Technical	&#13; Â  solutions	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  improve	&#13; Â  digital	&#13; Â  records	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  information	&#13; Â &#13;
management	&#13; Â  do	&#13; Â  exist,	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  can	&#13; Â  help	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  improve	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  situation.	&#13; Â  	&#13; Â  Technical	&#13; Â  measures	&#13; Â &#13;
alone	&#13; Â  will	&#13; Â  not	&#13; Â  be	&#13; Â  enough,	&#13; Â  however.	&#13; Â  	&#13; Â  New	&#13; Â  institutional	&#13; Â  structures	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  arrangements,	&#13; Â &#13;
including	&#13; Â updated	&#13; Â public	&#13; Â records	&#13; Â laws	&#13; Â and	&#13; Â more	&#13; Â integrated	&#13; Â information	&#13; Â governance	&#13; Â &#13;
arrangements,	&#13; Â  are	&#13; Â  also	&#13; Â  needed.	&#13; Â  	&#13; Â  Even	&#13; Â  this	&#13; Â  will	&#13; Â  be	&#13; Â  insufficient,	&#13; Â  though,	&#13; Â  without	&#13; Â &#13;
attention	&#13; Â to	&#13; Â underlying	&#13; Â incentive	&#13; Â structures.	&#13; Â &#13;
	&#13; Â &#13;
With	&#13; Â  discussions	&#13; Â  on	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  post-Â­â&#128;&#144;2015	&#13; Â  Strategic	&#13; Â  Development	&#13; Â  Goals	&#13; Â  now	&#13; Â  underway,	&#13; Â &#13;

building	&#13; Â  effective,	&#13; Â  accountable	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  inclusive	&#13; Â  institutions,	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  conclusions	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  be	&#13; Â &#13;
drawn	&#13; Â  from	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  research	&#13; Â  discussed	&#13; Â  in	&#13; Â  this	&#13; Â  paper	&#13; Â  suggest	&#13; Â  that	&#13; Â  it	&#13; Â  will	&#13; Â  be	&#13; Â  difficult	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â &#13;
achieve	&#13; Â progress	&#13; Â on	&#13; Â development	&#13; Â if	&#13; Â evidence	&#13; Â to	&#13; Â bring	&#13; Â bad	&#13; Â actors	&#13; Â to	&#13; Â justice	&#13; Â is	&#13; Â missing	&#13; Â &#13;
and	&#13; Â  if	&#13; Â  public	&#13; Â  officials	&#13; Â  continue	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  create	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  keep	&#13; Â  digital	&#13; Â  records	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  information	&#13; Â  as	&#13; Â &#13;

seem	&#13; Â  overdue	&#13; Â  to	&#13; Â  move	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  creation	&#13; Â  and	&#13; Â  handling	&#13; Â  of	&#13; Â  records	&#13; Â  up	&#13; Â  the	&#13; Â  global	&#13; Â &#13;

            World development report 2016 : digital
            dividends - one step forward, two steps backward? : does
            e-government make governments in developing countries more
            transparent and accountable?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Many countries are in the process of
            transitioning from primarily paper - based administrative
            systems to digital systems through the application of
            information and communication technology (ICTs) as part of
            e-Government initiatives. Though much has been written about
            the positive power of technology and information to support
            greater transparency and accountability and, by extension,
            development, this paper discusses literature relating to the
            unintended consequences and downside risks for transparency
            and accountability associated with the way recorded
            information is produced and managed in digitally enabled
            developing country public sector contexts. The implications
            of these risks for implementation of right to information
            laws is discussed, and a call is made for further research
            and greater attention to the effects of ICT use in the
            public sector, especially in regard to effects upon the
            operation of transparency and accountability mechanisms.
