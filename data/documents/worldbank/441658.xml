Competition in the Natural Gas Industry&#13;
The emergence of spot, financial, and pipeline capacity markets&#13;
Andre]Juris      Countries in Asia, Europe, and North and South America are introducing reforms to boost&#13;
efficiency and attract new private investment in their natural gas industries. The trend has been&#13;
to unbundle along vertical and horizontal lines and to open wholesale gas markets to new&#13;
entrants. These new entrants stimulate competition and the development of new markets-in&#13;
gas supply, in financial gas contracts, and in pipeline capacity. Such has been the success of&#13;
these new markets-especially in the United States and the United Kingdom-that it has&#13;
prompted a search for other potential markets in the industry. This Note, part of the broad effort&#13;
to aid reformers by disseminating knowledge from early reforms, describes the underlying&#13;
structural and trading arrangements in the gas and pipeline markets. Two companion Notes&#13;
examine these markets in the United Kingdom and the United States.&#13;

            Countries in Asia, Europe, and North and
            South America are introducing reforms to boost efficiency
            and attract new private investment in their natural gas
            industries. The trend has been to unbundle along vertical
            and horizontal lines and to open wholesale gas markets to
            new entrants. These new entrants stimulate competition and
            the development of new markets--in gas supply, in financial
            gas contracts, and in pipeline capacity. Such has been the
            success of these new markets--especially in the United
            States and the United Kingdom-- that it has prompted a
            search for other potential markets in the industry. This
            Note, part of the broad effort to aid reformers by
            disseminating knowledge from early reforms, describes the
            underlying structural and trading arrangements in the gas
            and pipeline markets. Two companion Notes examine these
            markets in the United Kingdom and the United States.
