&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Benefits:    The potential health and environmental benefits of improving the disposal of&#13;
more than 60% of the sewage from the Greater Bombay area are considered&#13;
substantial even though they are not readily quantifiable - particularly in&#13;
economic terms. Under this "First Stage" of development, some partially&#13;
treated sewage from two drainage areas will be discharged into the Arabian&#13;
Sea at a distance of three kilometers from the shore line. Sewage from three&#13;
other drainage areas will receive the equivalent of primary treatment before&#13;
being discharged to tidal creeks.&#13;
This level of sewage treatment and the effluent disposal arrangements will be&#13;
a significant improvement over the present situation, in which sewage is&#13;
discharged to the shoreline and to surface water drains and channels within the&#13;
heavily populated urban area. Furthermore, under the Project, detailed&#13;
studies will be conducted and a time-based program established for the&#13;
"Second Stage" Program of sewage treatment and disposal facilities to further&#13;
improve the quality of receiving waters.&#13;
The provision of sewage treatment and disposal facilities under this Project&#13;
will enable the very extensive collection and conveyance systems, which have&#13;
been constructed under the Second and Third Bombay Water Supply and&#13;
Sewerage Projects, to be effectively utilized.&#13;
The slum sanitation schemes will help alleviate the harsh living conditions of&#13;
some one million slum dwellers, mainly those occupying municipally-owned&#13;
lands, by providing improved sanitation facilities - principally for safe excreta&#13;
disposal. The implementation of this component will involve beneficiary&#13;
consultation as to the details of the facilities to be provided and participation&#13;
in the physical implementation and subsequent operations. Agreed&#13;
implementation "Policy Guidelines" will ensure that any resettlement&#13;
requirements are voluntary.&#13;
The direct physical benefits of the Project will come from removing domestic&#13;
sewage and industrial wastes from the inner city's natural water courses,&#13;
surface water drains, shore line and beaches thus improving the living&#13;
conditions of the urban population living in close proximity to the many "open&#13;
sewers" which presently exist. This will reduce health risks as well as&#13;
improve the city's visual and aesthetic environment.&#13;
Economic             No attempt has been made to estimate an economic rate of return. The&#13;
Rate of Return:      impacts on public health and the environment, which will result from the&#13;
proposed investments, cannot readily be quantified in economic terms.&#13;
Project Risks:       MCGB's engineers have insufficient relevant experience to undertake large&#13;
and specialized sewerage works of this nature; this increases the project risks.&#13;
However, these risks will be mitigated by support from experienced&#13;
consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vi -&#13;
The aerated lagoons largely involve the placement and compaction of selected&#13;
materials to form water retaining embankments and the construction of sand&#13;
drains. These works require careful site supervision to attain the required level of construction&#13;
quality, and sound on-site managemnent to avoid delays.&#13;
The ocean outfalls present higher risks. Tunneling under the sea bed has&#13;
fewer risks than constructing a pipeline on the surface of the sea bed, which is&#13;
subject to weather and sea conditions. The inherent uncertainties with this&#13;
kind of work, and the risk-sharing principles adopted in the contracts for this&#13;
work (for reasons of cost containment and efficiency) do nonetheless bring a&#13;
risk of cost overruns.&#13;
Measures have been taken to contain the construction risks by ensuring that,&#13;
prior to appraisal: (a) suitable contractors are pre-qualified under stringent&#13;
criteria; (b) engineering designs are compatible with proven construction&#13;
practices; (c) qualified consultants prepare the designs and supervise&#13;
construction, having been delegated acceptable levels of responsibility; and&#13;
(d) designs have been reviewed by qualified and experienced independent&#13;
panels of experts, and their suggestions reflected in the final designs.&#13;
To reduce the risk of cost over-runs, and any consequent delays in project&#13;
implementation, physical contingencies of 25 % have been allowed for all&#13;
civil, mechanical and electrical works, based on the rationale that for the&#13;
Worli and Bandra marine outfalls and the Ghatkopar influent tunnel there are&#13;
inherent uncertainties associated with tunnel construction. In the case of the&#13;
aerated lagoons at Ghatkopar and Bhandup, there is uncertainty in the location&#13;
of borrow areas that would yield sufficient laterite for embankment&#13;
construction. In the case of the Bandra pumping station, the magnitude and&#13;
complexity of work warrants a higher than average level of contingency.&#13;
Similarly, because of the programmatic nature of the slum sanitation schemes,&#13;
and the preliminary status of preparation of the pumping station structural&#13;
improvements and the conveyance system improvements, higher than average&#13;
physical contingencies are justified.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
BOMBAY SEWAGE DISPOSAL PROJECT&#13;
I THE WATER SUPPLY-SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.01   Urban water supply and sewerage (wastewater collection, treatment and disposal) are only two&#13;
elements of the fabric of urban infrastructure. Other elements include, for example, roads and street&#13;
lighting, storm water drainage works, electric power, telecommunications and so forth. However,&#13;
water supply and sewerage are often separated from the others by two particular features: (i) they are&#13;
not typically part of a "system" covering a much wider area as is the case, for example, in electric&#13;
power and telecommunications; thus, the water supply and sewerage works are essentially "local" in&#13;
character; and (ii) unlike roads an storm water drainage, water supply and sewerage lend themselves&#13;
readily to being organized and managed as "utility" services with the possibility of full direct cost-&#13;
recovery from beneficiaries.&#13;
1.02   These characteristics of water supply and sewerage have deserved its being classified as "a&#13;
sector" in the Bank and in India. In the Bank, water supply and sewerage lending commenced in the&#13;
mniddle 1960's - a few years before urban development lending commenced in the early 1970s.&#13;
1.03  In the late 1970s - it became recognized that water-borne sanitary sewerage, however&#13;
desirable from an overall sanitation and environmental viewpoint, was sufficiently costly that lower&#13;
cost alternatives were essential for many developing countries to realize improved sanitation and&#13;
urban environmental conditions. Accordingly, much research - in the Bank and elsewhere -&#13;
developed a number of lower cost alternatives for safe excreta disposal. In India, the twin-pit pour-&#13;
flush water-seal household latrine was the alternative widely adopted. While not providing all the&#13;
benefits of sanitary sewerage (since such latrines deal only with the safe disposal of excreta and not&#13;
with wastewater generally) such programs have been found to bring substantial environmental benefit&#13;
at more affordable costs than sanitary sewerage.&#13;
1.04   Accordingly, the sector in recent years has been more commonly referred to as the "water&#13;
supply and sanitation" sector, with the word "sanitation" often having the restricted meaning of safe&#13;
excreta disposal.&#13;
The Sector Context in India&#13;
1.05   India is the world's second most populous nation (844 millions in 1991) and accounts for 16%&#13;
of the world's population. India has a population nearly twice that of sub-Saharan Africa and of Latin&#13;
America. However, it is only the world's seventh nation in area (3,287,000 km2) and the gross&#13;
population densitv of 257 people per km2 is very high by world standards.&#13;
1.06   Urbanization, in India's 3,378 "urban communities", accounted for only 26% of the&#13;
population in 1991. This is low by world standards and such low levels elsewhere are to be found&#13;
mainly in other South Asian countries and in sub-Saharan Africa. However, this low level tends to&#13;
mask its sheer size of some 217 million people. Moreover, according to the UN's "World Population&#13;
Prospects" this population is projected to grow to 659 millions by the year 2015 - a growth of over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
400 million people. This projected growth by itself exceeds the population of all countries of the&#13;
world except China and India. In contrast, India's rural population is projected to decline marginally&#13;
(from 596 million in 1990 to 570 million in the year 2025).&#13;
1.07   The urban contribution to India's economy has been estimated as 29% of NDP in 1951, rising&#13;
to 55% in 1986 and is expected to exceed 60% by 2000. Thus, urban economic endeavor is making&#13;
a disproportionately large contribution in relation to its population.&#13;
1.08 Under India's constitution, community water supplv and sanitation, and local government&#13;
generally, are matters for India's 25 States. This is confirmed by the recent constitutional amendment&#13;
(the Central Nagar Palika Act - 1992) since ratified by the requisite number of States. This&#13;
constitutional amendment has three particular features worthy of note here: (i) the requirement that if&#13;
elected local governments are "suspended" by State government action, then elections for a&#13;
replacement are to be held within six months; (ii) the States are to constitute a "Municipal Finance&#13;
Commission" to report to the State legislature on the matter of State-local finances and revenue&#13;
sharing; and (iii) the States will appoint "District-level" (a geographic and administrative area within a&#13;
State) "Planning Committees". More broadly, the themes of this constitutional amendment are&#13;
oriented towards decentralization and local-level democracy and accountability.&#13;
1.09   The Central-State constitutional division of responsibility is particularly reflected in the&#13;
funding of urban (in some contrast to rural) water supply and sanitation investments as between the&#13;
Central and State levels of government. The following figures are from the 1992-97 Eighth Plan in&#13;
reporting actual expenditures under the 1986-91 Seventh Plan. It will be noted that the Central&#13;
contribution to urban water supply-sanitation were a mere 0.4% of the total; in contrast the Center&#13;
made a substantial (42%) contribution to such investments in rural areas. (Rs b is Rupees billion).&#13;

The Sector Context in Maharashtra and Bombay&#13;
1.10   Maharashtra is India's third largest State both by area (308,000 km2 - 9.4% India) and by&#13;
total 1991 population (78.8 million - 9.3% India). However, it ranks first in 1991 urban population&#13;
(30.5 million - 14.0% India) and first in absolute 1981-91 urban population growth (8.5 million) and&#13;
accounts for nearly 15 % of India's urban population growth in this period. By 1991, 45 % of&#13;
Maharashtra's population was urban. In 1989-90, Maharashtra accounted for 14% of India's NDP.&#13;
1.11   Bombay is India's largest city with a 1991 population in the urban agglomeration of 12.57&#13;
million or nearly 6% of India's total urban population. It is one of India's four "megacities" with a&#13;
population of more than five million which together accounted for 17% of India's urban population in&#13;
1991. It contains India's largest seaport and is India's pre-eminent center of trade, commerce and&#13;
finance. It is also a major manufacturing center and accounts for 30% of the value of India'a&#13;
industrial production and an estimated 10% of India's industrial employment.&#13;
&#13;

have been two subsequent loans to Bombay in this sector as follows:&#13;

} L$ 40.0 }&#13;
Sector Organization&#13;
1.13   Central-level. In recognition of the need for an urban policy focal point at the Center, the&#13;
Government of India (Gol) organized a Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment (MoUD) in 1985&#13;
(recently renamed the Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment MoUAE). This replaced the&#13;
erstwhile Central Ministry of Works and Housing. This Ministry has exercised influence through its&#13;
role in the review of State development plans, publication of various design manuals, coordination of&#13;
certain urban research and so forth. It has also influenced the polices and practices of India's&#13;
Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO). This latter institution, formed in 1970, is a&#13;
public-sector lending institution which was initially concerned with urban land development and public&#13;
housing schemes but in recent years has financed some urban infrastructure.&#13;
1.14   Within MoUAE, a Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organization&#13;
(CPHEEO) is a small group of public health/sanitary/environmental engineers which has organized&#13;
some training for sector personnel, published planning and design manuals and advises Gol on&#13;
technical matters in the sector.&#13;
1.15   State-level. In India's various States a typical pattern some 30 years ago was to form "Public&#13;
Health Engineering Departments" (PHEDs) from specialized staff within their Public Works&#13;
Departments (PWDs). These typically report through a State-level Department of Local Government&#13;
or Urban Development. The PHEDs usually provide what is essentially a public-sector planning/&#13;
design/construction-management engineering service to local governments and turn over the&#13;
completed water supply (or more rarely - sewerage) works to the local municipal governments for&#13;
operation and maintenance. In some States, the PHEDs additionally depute staff to the local&#13;
municipal governments to assist with and guide such operation and maintenance.&#13;
1.16. In some States, PHEDs have been superseded by "Water Supply and Sewerage Boards"&#13;
constituted by special State-level legislation '/. Such legislation prescribes the appointment of the&#13;
Board of Directors and senior officials of such "Boards" and which gives varying degrees of&#13;
autonomy of such agencies. However, only in the case of Kerala does the "Board" (the Kerala Water&#13;
Authority) function as a partially-autonomous utility organization with a full State-wide responsibility&#13;
for planning, design, operation, maintenance, revenue billing and collection and so forth. In some&#13;
other cases, the distinction between a "Board" and a PHED may be more apparent than real.&#13;
'/ These presently exist in the eight Sates of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka,&#13;
Rajasthan, Bihar, Gujarat and Kerala.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.17   Local-level. A responsibility for the provision of urban water supply and sanitation services&#13;
is traditionally a responsibility of the local-level municipal government and this is so prescribed in the&#13;
State-level "Municipal Act" or equivalent. Partly, no doubt, because of a typically weak technical&#13;
and management capacity at this level, the States have frequently usurped a substantial part of this&#13;
responsibility as described in paras 1.15 and 1.16. In the case of three large cities - Bangalore,&#13;
Madras and Hyderabad - the States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh respectively have&#13;
constituted by State-level legislation "local-level" partially-autonomous "Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Boards". These nominally have the mandate to function as "utility" organizations although their&#13;
degree of autonomy in such matters as personnel appointments, salaries, and service tariffs may be&#13;
quite limited. Thus, they may be much dependent on State-government support for the policies which&#13;
they develop and the management actions which they propose.&#13;
1.18   Urban local government in Maharashtra is under the State's Department of Urban&#13;
Development and governed by the Municipal and other Acts of the State's legislature. In the case of&#13;
Bombay, the provision of water supply and sewerage/sanitation services is within the overall&#13;
responsibility of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay (MCGB). Here, there is an elected&#13;
Council, and a "Standing Committee" of Council with executive authority. The most senior&#13;
administrative official is the "Municipal Commissioner" a member of India's Administrative Service&#13;
(IAS).&#13;
1.19   Within the MCGB organization is a Water Supply and Sewerage Department (WSSD).&#13;
Unusually, in India, the WSSD has maintained separate commercial-type accounts and plans, designs,&#13;
operates, maintains water supply and sewerage works and also conducts revenue billing and collection&#13;
and advises on all policy and regulatory aspects of the provision of these services. Thus, WSSD has&#13;
many of the features of a utility organization. This organizational arrangement evolved with relation&#13;
to the First Bank-supported Water Supply and Sewerage Project (para 1.12).&#13;
1.20   The matter of water resources management, of obvious relevance to this water supply-&#13;
sanitation sector, is assuming an increasing importance to both India and the Bank 2/, In India, water&#13;
resources are again a State matter under India's constitution. At this time in Maharashtra, and quite&#13;
commonly in other States, water resources planning and management is undertaken by State's&#13;
Irrigation Department and its Central Design Organization. In a few other States, "Water&#13;
Management Councils" (or some other title) with a broader water user representation than irrigation&#13;
and with a broader view of "resource management" than mere quantitative allocations, are being&#13;
established recently with Bank support in the preparation of several State-level "Water Resource&#13;
Consolidation Projects". To date, work on such projects is underway in the States of Haryana and&#13;
Tamil Nadu and is starting in other States. Additional Bank support to improved water resource&#13;
management is being prepared under a proposed National Hydrology Project.&#13;
Sector Development&#13;
1.21   The following table compares the state of sector development, in terms of "coverage", for the&#13;
years 1981 and 1990 - the period of the UN-declared International Water Drinking Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation Decade. It indicates:&#13;
(a)   a 1990 "coverage" for urban water supply of 86% of the urban population;&#13;
(b)  about two-thirds of this "coverage" was by private connections; the rest by public standposts;&#13;
(c)  the coverage for urban sanitation was much less - 44% only; and&#13;
2/ See "Water Resources Management - a World Bank Policy Paper" approved by the Board in&#13;
May-93.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d)   of this, about 70%  was by sewerage; the balance by "other" (see para 1.03).&#13;
Thus, only 31 % of India's 1990 urban population was served by sanitary sewers in 1990.&#13;

Government's Sectoral Policy&#13;
1.22    The Central Government continues to recognize the importance of safe drinking water supply&#13;
and basic sanitation for human health and welfare. Its Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-97) continues the&#13;
strong support of the 1987 National Water Policy, which gives the highest priority to drinking water&#13;
supply among all water uses, and recognizes the deficiencies in water and sanitation services in both&#13;
urban and rural areas. Sector constraints are identified as a lack of funds for the development of&#13;
water and sanitation (or sewerage) services in urban areas and a weak response by rural dwellers to&#13;
proposals for sanitation (excreta disposal) facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.23   In reviewing performance in the sector under the 1985-90 Seventh Plan the Government&#13;
concluded, inter alia, that:&#13;
(a)  in implementing water supply programs, the needs of backward and poorer segments of the&#13;
population were often neglected;&#13;
(b)  there is a wide gap between the level of urban water services and sewerage services;&#13;
(c)  substantial improvements were needed in the pricing of water, billing and collection;&#13;
(d)   water losses due to wastage and leakage are substantial and require corrective measures;&#13;
(e)  there is a need for programs to be more cost effective;&#13;
(f)   operation and maintenance of water supply systems are badly neglected;&#13;
(g)  inadequate sewerage systems are contributing to the pollution of ground and surface water&#13;
sources and to the increased incidence of water borne diseases; corrective measures need to be&#13;
taken to prevent further pollution and to improve river water quality;&#13;
(h)   more attention should be given to the water supply and sanitation needs of small towns (up to&#13;
population 20,000) since such towns have an inadequate financial base from which to finance&#13;
such facilities; and&#13;
(i)  local funding requirements of externally financed projects should be more carefully examined&#13;
to avoid implementation delays.&#13;
1.24   These issues are to be addressed under the Eighth Plan. In addition emphasis will be given to&#13;
generally improving rural water supplies, to the reduction of water borne diseases and particularly to&#13;
the eradication of guineaworm, and to improving water quality. A further objective is to increase the&#13;
level of service of rural sanitation to 5 % of the rural population by the end of the Plan period.&#13;
1.25   In urban areas, the Plan proposes the extension of drinking water services to 100% of the&#13;
population by the year 2000, with a priority given to small towns. In addition, financially viable&#13;
sewerage systems are to be provided to cities with low-cost sanitation to fringe areas. Solid waste&#13;
collection and disposal systems would be developed for major metropolitan areas. Some of the&#13;
strategies identified in the Eighth Plan are listed below. They are discussed further under "The Main&#13;
Sector Issues, in the context of this proposed project and other Bank endeavor, commencing&#13;
para 1.26.&#13;
(a)   management of water as a commodity, as with any other resource;&#13;
(b)  freedom for local authorities to charge appropriate tariffs to cover operation and maintenance&#13;
cost and also development costs where appropriate;&#13;
(c)  the encouragement of private sector efforts for both the construction and maintenance of water&#13;
supply projects;&#13;
(d)  reduction of pollution by provision of treatment facilities for industrial wastes and sewage;&#13;
and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(e)  separation of the budget for water supply and sanitation from the general municipal budget.&#13;
The Main Sector Issues&#13;
1.26   A weak policy and institutional framework for the allocation and management of water&#13;
resources. Notwithstanding a National Water Policy (para 1.22), water resources are a State subject&#13;
under India's constitution (para 1.20). Thus, addressing this issue is much dependent on action by the&#13;
individual States or mutually agreed cooperative action between two or more States. The available&#13;
water resources are subject to ever-increasing demand pressures, particularly for irrigation and for&#13;
community water supply. Additionally, the quality of water available is being increasingly threatened&#13;
by pollution of various kinds from both urban and rural sources. Such issues are being increasingly&#13;
well-recognized in India (eg see para 1.25(a)) and some measures to address them have been initiated.&#13;
Some Bank-supported endeavor in this area was noted in para 1.20. Additionally, the Bank is&#13;
supporting two Industrial Pollution Control Projects (which include Maharashtra). However, as in&#13;
many countries of the world, developed and developing, their full resolution is a long-term&#13;
proposition.&#13;
1.27 The need for improved general, personnel and financial management in the water supply-&#13;
sanitation sector institutions. In general, the sector institutions in India and their management have&#13;
been much dominated by engineers and by a bureaucratic rather than an active management,&#13;
commercial and consumer-service frame of mind which is essential for the effectiveness of the&#13;
"utility" organizational model. Over the last few years, this issue has been increasingly recognized in&#13;
India and the management and efficiency benefits of some of the institutional changes introduced in&#13;
Bank-supported projects (including Bombay) are being seen as a path to follow more generally (see&#13;
also para 1.33).&#13;
1.28   The need for improved cost-recovery from beneficiaries. The widespread failure to realize&#13;
full cost-recovery for water supply-sanitation services has made sector investments dependent on State&#13;
and local budgetary allocations and precluded the evolution of private debt financing of such&#13;
investments. The net consequence has been that investments have been at inadequate levels; this in&#13;
turn gives rise to valid complaints of poor service which in turn reduces the public willingness to pay.&#13;
Breaking this unproductive cycle has been a key objective of Bank-supported investments in the sector&#13;
in India and has been successfully implemented in Bombay. The need to address this issue is&#13;
increasingly accepted in India (eg see para 1.25(b)); full cost-recovery was firmly endorsed at a&#13;
National Conference on Water Supply and Sanitation Policy held in March, 1993. However, while&#13;
implementing action is variable across the country, it has been achieved over many years in Bombay.&#13;
1.29   The intermittent delivery of water to consumers. With rare exception, urban water supply in&#13;
India (including Bombay) is delivered to consumers intermittently, and sometimes for as little as two&#13;
hours per day. This may be a "rationing" response to a sheer inadequacy of the amount of the water&#13;
supply. However, it is often the result of: (i) excessive leakage from the water system; and (ii) of&#13;
water wastage by consumers. The reasons for the excessive leakage are some combination of the use&#13;
of poor quality or inappropriate pipe materials, of poor workmanship at the time of construction and&#13;
of poor maintenance. The reasons for water wastage include the relative rarity of consumer metering&#13;
and volumetric tariffs and under-pricing of water even where these exist. One obstacle to effective&#13;
metering has been the frequently poor quality of such meters as manufactured in India. One&#13;
consequence of intermittent water delivery is that it brings the risk of the ingress of contamination&#13;
into the distribution system when it is not under pressure with obvious health risks. Another&#13;
consequence is the encouragement of private investment in (uneconomic) household water storage by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
those who can afford it. Yet a third consequence is that the water distribution system cannot perform&#13;
as designed and that seriously low (or no) pressure reduces the level of consumer satisfaction with the&#13;
water service. This issue is being vigorously addressed in more recent Bank-supported projects with&#13;
the hope it will furnish some methodological models for wider application. Water supply continues to&#13;
be intermittent in Bombay but this issue is outside the purview of this Bombay Sewage Disposal&#13;
Project (BSDP).&#13;
1.30   The need for improved engineering planning and design and material/construction quality&#13;
management. The soundness of sector investments is entirely dependent on the quality of these&#13;
activities, which also embrace all aspects of procurement. This problem appears in both water supply&#13;
and sewerage but tends to be greater in sewerage where there is much less indigenous experience. To&#13;
address this issue, the Bank has been requiring or encouraging the use of the services of private sector&#13;
independent consulting engineers. Frequently, in practice, such services have been obtained from&#13;
foreign-local associations of firms which combines the benefits of experience elsewhere with local&#13;
knowledge. To the extent that "good practice" is transferred to Indian firms and sector institutions by&#13;
the foreign participation, this itself is a "development benefit". Private consulting engineering firms&#13;
are necessarily much motivated by concern for their reputation since this plays a large part in their&#13;
securing future assignments. They are also motivated by the risk of being found financially liable for&#13;
the consequences of proven professional negligence. The use of private consulting engineering&#13;
services, including those of foreign-local associations of firms, is gaining wider acceptance in India&#13;
generally and in Bombay in particular. Such services have been used very extensively in the&#13;
preparation of this BSDP and will be used extensively in its implementation.&#13;
1.31   Poor operation and maintenance. Even when well designed and constructed using appropriate&#13;
materials of good quality, water and sewerage systems certainly need operation and periodic&#13;
maintenance for the sake of realizing the full benefit potential of the investments. Specific measures&#13;
are included in this BSDP to address this issue.&#13;
The Bank's Sector Obiectives&#13;
1.32   The essence of the Bank's water supply and sanitation sector strategy in India has been and is&#13;
to: (a) improve its mobilization of financial resources; and (b) to improve the efficiency of financial&#13;
and human resource utilization.&#13;
1.33   In pursuit of these objectives, Bank projects have: (a) encouraged the efficient use of&#13;
resources through appropriate technology choices and sound engineering design and construction;&#13;
(b) supported institutional development and improved institutional capacity having a "consumer-&#13;
service" orientation; (c) encouraged the financial viability and managerial efficiency of sector&#13;
institutions through the adoption of commercial style accounting; (d) assisted in the formulation of&#13;
pricing policies to encourage water conservation and to provide affordable water and sanitation&#13;
services to the poor, consistent with adequate financing of current expenditures and the internal&#13;
generation of funds for further investment; and (e) encouraging sector institutions to participate&#13;
actively in improved institutional arrangements for water resources management (paras 1.20, 1.25(a)&#13;
and 1.26). Such measures contribute to addressing the sector issues identified in paras 1.26 - 1.31.&#13;
1.34   The growing acceptance by the central and state governments of these basic objectives, as&#13;
witnessed by the Central Government's strategies expressed in the Eighth Five Year Plan (paras 1.23 -&#13;
1.25), indicates a potential for considerable further sector performance improvement in the medium&#13;
and long term. However, it is clear that in future, continued effort will be needed to address the&#13;
issues outlined above (paras 1.26 - 1.31) and to improve, in particular:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
(a)  unaccounted-for-water management and water conservation (with the objective of continuous&#13;
delivery to consumers) through consumer metering, leak detection and repair (or replacement&#13;
of leaking pipes beyond repair), good water system surveillance to control illicit connections&#13;
and good management and management of meter reading, revenue billing and collection;&#13;
supplies for a few hours per day;&#13;
(b)  the design of tariffs charged for water supply and sewerage services which serve at the same&#13;
time the objectives of the avoidance of complexity, the affordability of services to the poor&#13;
and the achievement of full financial viability;&#13;
(c)  the management capacity in sector institutions through personnel training programs;&#13;
(d)  operation and maintenance practices and performance, also through personnel training; and&#13;
(e)  the quality of engineering planning-design and construction quality surveillance through the&#13;
use of the services of private firms of consulting engineers and otherwise.&#13;
Performance in Previous Bank Operations&#13;
1.35   The Bank Group began supporting water supply and sewerage/sanitation projects in India in&#13;
FY1974 (the first Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project) and by the end of FY 1992 had&#13;
approved 13 such projects. These have accounted for US$994 million in IDA Credits and US$93&#13;
million in IBRD Loans. In addition, a further 11 urban projects have been approved, accounting for&#13;
US$990 million in Credits and US$44 million in Loans. In these urban projects, on the average,&#13;
more than half the investments have been for water supply and sewerage/sanitation investments&#13;
forming part of a city-wide infrastructure.&#13;
1.36   Of the 13 water supply and sewerage projects, the following six projects have been completed&#13;
and project completion reports (PCRs) or project performance audit reports (PPARs) have been&#13;
prepared. These are the First and Second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Projects; Uttar&#13;
Pradesh; Punjab; Maharashtra; and Rajasthan. A review of the project completion reports 3/&#13;
indicates that in most cases the physical work has been brought to completion although in most&#13;
projects there have been implementation delays. However, in some instances the quality of&#13;
construction work is questioned. In the case of the Second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Project, both procurement management and construction quality were found to be very seriously&#13;
inadequate. Thus, an Annex 13 to this SAR entitled "Lessons Learned and their Application" also&#13;
contains the full text of the Evaluation Summary from the relevant OED PPAR Report No 9265 of&#13;
December, 1990.&#13;
1.37   The reported poor quality of construction has been due largely to lack of experience and&#13;
ability on the part of the engineers supervising construction, and a failure to require contractors to&#13;
comply with the terms of the contract documents. Implementation delays appear to have resulted&#13;
primarily from ineffective construction management on the part of the contractors and the government&#13;
entity supervising the work, although there are a number of other factors to which delays may be&#13;
attributed, such as: lack of counterpart funds; inability to prepare clear and concise procurement&#13;
documents and to reach procurement decisions; poor procurement management, disputes between&#13;
3 The report numbers and dates are, respectively: PCR 5875 (Oct. 1985); PPAR 9265 (Dec 1990);&#13;
PCR 6242 (June 1986); 6935 (Sep. 1987); 7202 (April 1988); PCR 8090 (Sep 1989).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
contractors and the implementing agencies; poor planning and insufficiently detailed project&#13;
preparation; and land acquisition difficulties.&#13;
1.38   The more successful aspects of the projects have included the economic selection of&#13;
components through careful comparison of alternatives during the project preparation stages. The use&#13;
of lower cost technical options has sometimes been possible and successful. In addition, programs to&#13;
develop low-cost sanitation for the fringes of urban areas and for areas having lower population&#13;
densities have achieved increasing acceptance from sector institutions and the public. One of the most&#13;
serious and pervasive sector deficiencies is the lack of incentive and ability to operate and maintain&#13;
completed facilities to acceptable standards.&#13;
1.39   The trend of objectives in earlier projects has been to improve: cost recovery; institutional&#13;
efficiency through improved management; financial accounting and reporting systems. Associated&#13;
objectives have attempted to reduce unaccounted-for water and improve user charging by metering&#13;
and more efficient billing and collection. A report prepared in 1986 in collaboration between the&#13;
Government of India and the Bank, titled "Water Supply and Sewerage Projects Financed By the&#13;
World Bank in India - Financial and Institutional Performance" concluded that in general terms these&#13;
objectives have not been achieved to an appreciable extent. Reasons for the apparent lack of&#13;
achievement are widespread, but the major constraints are summarized as:&#13;
(a) popular opposition to tariff increases because, traditionally, water was regarded as a free&#13;
good;&#13;
(b) the objectives were too ambitious and inadequate planning and preparation preceded the&#13;
attempts to achieve them;&#13;
However, there is a growing recognition throughout the sector, and by the public, that adequate&#13;
tariffs are justifiable as the only available mechanism for realizing the resources to improve services.&#13;
1.40   More recent Bank-supported projects have aimed to reflect the lessons of experience.&#13;
Ongoing projects in Madras (FY87 Cr 1822-IN and Ln 2846-IN) and in Hyderabad (FY90 Cr&#13;
2115-IN and Ln 3181-IN) are performing rather better than earlier projects. Both include substantial&#13;
unaccounted-for water management efforts. In Hyderabad, strong general management is building a&#13;
capable senior management team which has instituted many personnel reforms (many aimed at&#13;
inculcating a consumer-service orientation), a comprehensive personnel training program, improved&#13;
and computerized financial accounting systems and good construction quality management practices&#13;
and improved operations.&#13;
1.41   Thus, there is evidence that persistence and effort, on the part of the Bank and the sector&#13;
agencies, supported by the State and Central governments, can yield substantial development benefits.&#13;
At the samne time, it is recognized that many objectives will only be achieved in the medium and&#13;
longer term.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement in the Proposed Proiect&#13;
1.42   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of 19-May-95, to be reviewed by the Bank's Board&#13;
on 20-Jun-95, has emphasized that, in urban areas, there is an urgent need to build the institutional&#13;
and financial framework that will enable cities to provide critically-needed services to a rapidly&#13;
growing population. Its paragraph 32 discusses the key urban issues and its Attachment 1 lists the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
sectoral reform objectives. One key theme of this CAS is State-level finances (and, by implication,&#13;
local-level finances).&#13;
1.43   Attachment 1 to this 1995 CAS reviews the status of sectoral objectives to be supported&#13;
through the Bank's lending operations as outlined in the 1994 CAS. It notes, under urban&#13;
infrastructure, the impending commencement of a comprehensive review of urban infrastructure&#13;
financing.&#13;
1.44   In the design of the project and the related dialogue with MCGB during preparation and&#13;
appraisal, particular attention has been paid to the lessons of experience (Annex 13). Due account has&#13;
also been taken of the five areas of the Bank's special operational emphasis. These are reviewed in&#13;
turn in the context of features and components of the Project.&#13;
1.45   Poverty Alleviation. The slum sanitation component is explicitly focussed on alleviating&#13;
health risks, and improving the urban environmental conditions for some one million slum dwellers in&#13;
Bombay.&#13;
1.46   Participation. Specific investments under the slum sanitation components will be planned&#13;
following the conduct of social surveys and taking account of beneficiary preferences and attitudes.&#13;
The public participation and review in the environmental assessment process during project&#13;
preparation was an important force in stimulating MCGB's commitment to this component, which will&#13;
be implemented with the assistance, inter alia, of NGOs.&#13;
1.47   Gender Issues. The Slum Sanitation Schemes will provide a particular benefit to women, who&#13;
have stronger concerns for privacy and who bear the brunt of the problems arising from ill health in&#13;
the family.&#13;
1.48   Environment. The entire project is to be perceived as an important part of a staged program&#13;
to realize urban environmental improvements through improved wastewater conveyance, treatment&#13;
and disposal and improved excreta disposal facilities for the poor.&#13;
1.49   Private Sector Development. The goods and works will be procured by open bidding and&#13;
contracts are expected to awarded to private sector suppliers and contractors; this is normal Bank and&#13;
Indian practice. However, in this project, a greater role than has been normal in Indian practice has&#13;
been assigned to private consulting engineering firms for both engineering planning and design and&#13;
for the supervision of construction, including quality management.&#13;
1.50  In addition to features of the Project which respond to the five areas of special emphasis, it is&#13;
noted here that the project includes foreign-local consulting services to review MCGB's WSSD&#13;
sewerage system operation and maintenance organization, management and practices and to make&#13;
recommendations and furnish personnel training for improvements. Although a small part of the&#13;
Project in financial terms this element of the Project should make an important contribution to&#13;
institutional development and to the eventual efficiency of prior, proposed and future sewerage system&#13;
investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
II PROJECT AREA, SERVICES AND DEMAND&#13;
The Project Area&#13;
2.01   Bombay is the capital city of Maharashtra State. The Bombay urban agglomeration, and its&#13;
total 1991 population of 12.57 million, was described in para 1. 11. Urban planning for the whole&#13;
agglomeration is the mandate of the Bombay Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA).&#13;
Within this agglomeration the municipal boundaries of the MCGB - the Project Area - occupy an area&#13;
of 440 km2 and account for an estimated population of about 10 million - about 3 million on Bombay&#13;
Island and 7 million in the "suburbs". These boundaries were established in the 1950s with their&#13;
extension from the "Island" to include "the suburbs".&#13;
2.02   The annual average population growth in Bombay's urban agglomeration between 1981 and&#13;
1991 rate was 4.3%; this is significantly higher than the 3.1% average for India's urban areas as a&#13;
whole. This rate of growth ranked seventh highest among India's 23 metropolitan cities having a&#13;
population of more than one million, but it was the highest in absolute terms.&#13;
2.03   Unfortunately, the provision of infrastructure and housing has not nearly kept pace with such&#13;
growth rate. Bombay's population was a mere 3 millions in 1951. Thus, Bombay economic strength&#13;
and its role in India's economy has created abundant employment opportunities and attracted rural&#13;
migrants but an estimated 5 million of the present population live in slum conditions and about one&#13;
million of these have occupied municipally-owned lands.&#13;
Water Supplv Services&#13;
2.04   Annex 1 gives a brief history of Bombay's water supply system which was initially&#13;
constructed in the mid-19th century to serve commercial and residential areas in the southern portion&#13;
of Bombay Island near the harbor and the Fort. Subsequent rapid expansion of commerce and&#13;
development of industry required the addition of a new source of supply, setting a pattern which was&#13;
to be repeated in 1879, 1883, 1944, 1957, 1965, 1979, 1984 and 1990. On completion of the&#13;
ongoing Bank and IDA assisted Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage project in 1996, the total&#13;
water supply to the Greater Bombay area will reach an average of 2,930 Mld (644 MIGD) or about&#13;
80% of an estimated gross water demand of about 3,570 Mld (785 MIGD).&#13;
2.05   The 1996 water supply of 2,930 Mld represents an average daily per capita domestic water&#13;
supply of about 130 liters after deductions for transmission system, distribution system and treatment&#13;
plant losses and for industrial, commercial and government use. Despite the considerable efforts over&#13;
almost half a century to develop new water sources, Bombay has failed to meet the demand for water&#13;
due to rapid population increases, geographic expansion of the area, insufficient sector investments&#13;
and system leakage. This has resulted in an intermittent water delivery to consumers for periods&#13;
ranging from 2 to 5 hours per day. This operational mode causes technical difficulties with regard to&#13;
metering, leakage detection and system maintenance and may also jeopardize public health (para&#13;
1.29). Investment funding constraints and the higher priority accorded to water supply has led to a&#13;
comparative neglect of sewage collection, treatment and disposal creating serious environmental&#13;
problems and risks to public health.&#13;
2.06   The Central Design Organization of the GOM Irrigation Department, is responsible for master&#13;
plan water resource studies to meet BMR's future water needs (para 1.20). This organization in&#13;
conjunction with BMRDA, which is responsible under GOM's Department of Urban Development for&#13;
planning and investment programming, has proposed four sources of water supply for future&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
development. For the sake of public health and of the economic provision of water supply services,&#13;
the next water supply objective should be the provision of water delivery on a continuous (24 hour&#13;
per day) basis (para 1.29). This will require, inter alia, the establishment of full consumer metering&#13;
and a volumetric tariff, as a means of controlling consumption and waste and a vigorous&#13;
"unaccounted-for water management program" including leak detection and repair to control system&#13;
leakage within acceptable limits.&#13;
Sanitary Sewerage Development and Service Levels&#13;
2.07   Over the past fifty years, in the efforts to develop urban infrastructure and keep pace with&#13;
rapid urban growth being experienced in Bombay, a higher priority was accorded to water supply as&#13;
compared to sanitary sewerage. This factor, and financial resource constraints, led to a situation in&#13;
which only a very small area of the city was served by a piped sewerage system and the remainder&#13;
of the urban area discharged wastewater indiscriminately to surface water streams, gullies and to open&#13;
stormwater drains. The history of evolution of the sewerage system is also given in Annex 1.&#13;
2.08   The beginning of a planned attempt to reverse this situation was under the FY73 Bank-assisted&#13;
First Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 390-IN). Various sewerage system studies&#13;
were undertaken in the 1970's and a Sewerage Master Plan 41 was completed in 1979 which&#13;
provides the basis for collection, conveyance and disposal of sewage from the Greater Bombay&#13;
area to the year 2005. Under this First Bank-assisted project, implementation difficulties and cost&#13;
overruns resulted in reduction in the scope of work and deferral of the sewerage system expansion to&#13;
the FY79 Second Bombay water Supply and Sewerage Project (Cr 842-IN). Although this credit&#13;
closed on 31-Mar-88, parts of some components of the project are still under construction.&#13;
2.09   The objective of the Second Project was to improve and extend the sewage collection system&#13;
to serve between 80% and 90% of the properties throughout the whole of the Greater Bombay area&#13;
and to provide treatment facilities and a safe means of sewage effluent disposal. The FY86 Bank-&#13;
supported Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Cr. 1750-IN/Ln 2769-IN) primarily&#13;
addressed expansion of the water supply system and included only relatively minor extensions of the&#13;
sewage collection system in suburban areas. However, mechanical and electrical works (outstanding&#13;
from the Second Project) for two major pumping stations (Bhandup and Ghatkopar) were added to&#13;
this Third project after credit/loan effectiveness.&#13;
2.10   The proposed project represents most of the first stage of development of facilities to&#13;
partially treat and dispose of sewage which is collected and conveyed to the proposed treatment and&#13;
disposal sites by facilities constructed under the three earlier Bombay Water Supply and Sewage&#13;
Projects. The major part of these collection and conveyance facilities is completed; the remainder&#13;
(including some remedial works, the Bandra pumping station, facilities to overcome siltation in&#13;
the Ghatkopar influent and an influent tunnel to Ghatkopar pumping station) are included in&#13;
the proposed project.&#13;
2.11   The configuration of the Greater Bombay sewerage system is appropriately planned and&#13;
constructed around seven natural drainage or service areas (Annex 1). The Table below provides an&#13;
4 "Methods for Treatment and Disposal of Wastewaters from Greater Bombay"; Metcalf and Eddy&#13;

2.12  In the First Stage of development, sewage from three service areas (Versova, Bhandup and&#13;
Ghatkopar) will be treated in facilities to remove screenings and grit, and will then pass to aerated&#13;
lagoons which will provide biological treatment to the level of conventional primary treatment. The&#13;
treated effluent will then be discharged to Malad and Thane tidal creeks. One of the three aerated&#13;
lagoons (Versova) is under construction, partially financed under the Bombay Urban Development&#13;
Project (Cr. 1544-IN) and BWSSP III (Cr 1750-IN/Ln 2769-IN) and is due to be completed in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
December 1996. Bid invitations for the remaining two aerated lagoons (Bhandup and Ghatkopar)&#13;
were issued in April 1995 and these lagoons would be financed under the proposed project. The&#13;
original Master Plan Study (para 2.08) recommended that sewage from Malad service area also be&#13;
treated in aerated lagoons prior to discharge to Malad creek. However, more recent studies showed&#13;
this to be impracticable due to the limited assimilative capacity of the creek. These works have&#13;
therefore been deferred to the Second Stage Program (Annex 5) to allow sufficient time for further&#13;
study of treatment and disposal alternatives.&#13;
2.13   Sewage from two of the remaining three service areas (Worli and Bandra), which account for&#13;
about 60% of Bombay's total flow, will receive partial treatment, comprising screening and grit&#13;
removal, and will then be discharged into the ocean through two marine outfalls. These outfalls,&#13;
which are 3.5 meters in diameter and three kilometers long, and for which bids have been&#13;
received, would be financed under the proposed project.&#13;
2.14   Sewage from the remaining service area, which is the smallest of the seven service areas,&#13;
receives preliminary treatment at a completed installation (at Colaba) and is discharged to the harbor&#13;
through a 1. 1 km long 1.2 meter diameter outfall.&#13;
2.15   The construction of the two outfalls at Worli and Bandra is a major engineering task. As&#13;
previously designed, they were to consist of reinforced concrete pipes laid in a sea bed trench. A&#13;
1984 contract (financed under the Second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project Cr 842-IN) to&#13;
construct the two outfalls was terminated in 1987 as a result of technical difficulties, contractual&#13;
disputes and disputed data concerning the seabed conditions. The contract is now under litigation.&#13;
2.16   In March 1988, Credit 842-IN was drawn down and closed. Because of implementation&#13;
delays, cost overruns, technical problems, funding problems and litigation, MCGB was unable to&#13;
proceed with completion of the two marine outfalls and the aerated lagoons at versova. MCGB&#13;
retained foreign consultants (financed under the Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project)&#13;
to reinvestigate the sea bed conditions, to further evaluate the costs, benefits and risks of alternative&#13;
approaches to completing the outfalls, and to prepare detailed engineering designs. To curtail the&#13;
debate on the least-cost construction method, it was decided to prepare designs and invite bids for two&#13;
alternatives: (i) a dredged seabed trench and pipe alternative, similar in many respects to that&#13;
described in para 2.15; and (ii) for submarine tunnel alternative; it was agreed that the decision on&#13;
the choice would be made on the basis of bid price. However, it is noted here that the tunnel choice&#13;
has the least adverse effect on the environment (see Annex 11). As noted (para 2.13), designs and&#13;
bidding procedures (by ICB - from stringently pre-qualified bidders) for the outfalls have now been&#13;
completed. The bid evaluation has been completed and furnished to the Bank, and award of a&#13;
construction contract for their construction in submarine tunnel is being processed; the award is now&#13;
scheduled for the second half of 1995. The lowest bid for the seabed trench/pipe alternative was&#13;
more than double that for the submarine tunnel.&#13;
2.17   A number of design and construction deficiencies in pumping stations and other components&#13;
financed under the Second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project were reported by a Bank&#13;
supervision mission in 1989. As a consequence, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay&#13;
(MCGB) was asked to appoint consultants, acceptable to the Bank, to review these works and to assist&#13;
MCGB in the coordination and supervision of the remaining works forming part of the overall,&#13;
integrated sewerage system. Such consultants were duly appointed in May 1991 and a "Remedial&#13;
Works Program" was formulated and agreed upon and implementation of works to remedy some of&#13;
these defects is now proceeding. MCGB has agreed to a dated action program for implementation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
the Remainder of the Remedial Works Program (Annex 1, paras 12-16). At negotiations. agreement&#13;
was reached that MCGB will complete the implementation of the Remedial Works Program.&#13;
2.18   Upon completion of these remedial works and completion of other components that are now&#13;
under construction under MCGB financing and under the Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Project, about 80% to 90% of the properties and an estimated 45 % of the population of the Greater&#13;
Bombay area (total estimated population 10 million) will be connected to a water-borne sewerage&#13;
system capable of conveying domestic and industrial wastes to facilities for partial treatment and&#13;
disposal.&#13;
2.19   With the exception of the Malad drainage area, the works ongoing and proposed as described&#13;
above will complete the "First Stage Works" conceived in the Master Plan. As part of the "Second&#13;
Stage Program" either a further outfall or a sewage treatment facility (or a combination of both) will&#13;
be required to serve the Malad and Versova service areas. These components will bring the entire&#13;
sewerage system into full operation. However, further works are desirable for further environmental&#13;
improvement and are proposed under "Stage 2" of the program - see Annexes 2 and 5.&#13;
2.20   The portion of the population not served by the system, estimated at 40% to 50%, represents&#13;
the pavement and slum-dwellers with no permanent housing. The solution to this issue does not rely&#13;
on the development of the sewerage system, which has been designed, and is being constructed, to&#13;
serve the entire urban area including those parts of the city occupied by the slum dwellers and the&#13;
homeless. The solution lies in the provision of sanitation facilities explicitly for these poorer&#13;
segments of the population. A part of these needs are also proposed to be met by the slum&#13;
sanitation schemes included in the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

III THE PROJECT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
3.01   The major policy objectives of the first three Bank-supported water supply-sanitation projects&#13;
were: (a) to establish an appropriate and effective public institution in Bombay to manage the&#13;
planning, design construction, operation and maintenance for the provision of water supply and&#13;
sewerage services; and (b) to establish a revenue stream to finance maintenance and operation and a&#13;
portion of capital investment.&#13;
3.02   With regard to the first of these earlier objectives MCGB's WSSD has shown marked&#13;
improvement in the water supply subsector but achievements in the sewerage subsector fall far short&#13;
of the level required for an entity of this magnitude and importance. Some on-the-job training and&#13;
further experience has been given by deputing some WSSD staff to work with the consultants&#13;
assisting project preparation and such arrangements are planned during project implementation. One&#13;
of the objectives of the proposed project would, therefore, address the further improvement of&#13;
WSSD's ability in planning and implementation of sewerage works, with particular emphasis on&#13;
construction management and supervision.&#13;
3.03   The second of these earlier objectives, the establishment of a revenue stream to finance&#13;
maintenance and operation of the water supply and sewerage facilities and a portion of capital&#13;
investment, has been substantially achieved in recent years but will require further effort and action to&#13;
sustain these gains to date.&#13;
3.04   A further institutional objective was the development of MCGB's capacity to fully understand&#13;
and manage the conduct of good environmental impact assessments in conjunction with project&#13;
formulation and design. This has been substantially achieved during the preparation phase of the&#13;
project, albeit the use of assistance from consultants in such efforts in the future will, no doubt, be&#13;
both desirable and cost-effective.&#13;
3.05   An additional institutional development aspect of this Project is concerned with organizational&#13;
changes, the establishment of procedures and provision of additional facilities to raise the standards&#13;
of WSSD's operation and maintenance practices for the entire sewerage system to a level&#13;
consistent with good and cost-effective practice (see Annex 3, paras 28 and 29).&#13;
3.06   The physical objectives of the Project are to complete the facilities (originally proposed and&#13;
partially completed under the First, Second and Third Water Supply and Sewerage Projects) and&#13;
provide for the improved safety of the disposal of sewage from Greater Bombay, to complete these in&#13;
substantial accordance with realistic timetables, and with a good construction quality (see para 1.37).&#13;
This will realize further benefits from achieving full utilization of facilities which have been&#13;
constructed so far and set the stage for further such improvements under the "second stage" program&#13;
(Annex 5). They are also to construct sanitation improvement facilities, mainly for safe excreta&#13;
disposal, to benefit up to one million slum dwellers residing in some 164 slums on municipally-owned&#13;
lands. This is proposed to be implemented following social and physical/technical surveys and a&#13;
beneficiary consultation process. Thus, beneficiary preferences will be fully taken into account in the&#13;
determination of the works selected for implementation - all in the context of technically-feasible and&#13;
cost-effective options. These processes are designed, inter alia, to identify, on a slum by slum basis,&#13;
where no involuntary resettlement is required for implementation (para 6.20 and Annex 14).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
3.07  In summary, from the preceding, the Project objectives are:&#13;
(a)  strengthening the capacity of MCGB's WSSD in all aspects of the management of the&#13;
provision of sewerage services including planning, design, construction supervision including&#13;
materials and construction quality management, operation and maintenance;&#13;
(b)  sustaining the financial viability of the provision of water supply and sewerage services in&#13;
Greater Bombay through direct charges to beneficiaries at appropriate levels;&#13;
(c)  imnproving the health and environmental conditions in Greater Bombay through the&#13;
construction of sewerage works improvements so designed and constructed as to conveniently&#13;
and economically permit a further level of such improvements in the future; and&#13;
(d)  improving the health and environmental conditions for a significant portion of the slum&#13;
dwellers of Bombay through the construction of sustainable sanitation improvement facilities,&#13;
mainly for safe excreta disposal, of a kind and nature determined in consultation with the&#13;
prospective beneficiaries.&#13;
Description&#13;
3.08   The project components are described in more detail in Annex 3 and are summarized in the&#13;
schedules and detailed cost estimates in Annex 4. The locations of the project physical works are&#13;
shown on Map IBRD 26628. Physical components of the project are summarized below; design&#13;
capacities, which are based on year 2005 flows, are shown in parentheses and represent average dry&#13;
weather flows in million liters per day (Mld).&#13;
Physical Components&#13;
(a)  Construction of a 3 km long and 3.5 meter diameter marine outfall in submarine tunnel at&#13;
Worli (or Lovegrove) (760) and a similar outfall at Bandra (796);&#13;
(b)  Construction of Bandra pumping station (796);&#13;
(c)  Construction of aerated lagoons at Ghatkopar (386) and Bhandup (176);&#13;
(d)  Construction of facilities to overcome siltation in an influent tunnel at Ghatkopar and&#13;
rehabilitation of an existing tunnel (386);&#13;
(e)  The implementation of Slum Sanitation Schemes, conducted using beneficiary participation&#13;
methods, in those of 164 slums which occupy municipally-owned lands (which are inhabited&#13;
by an estimated one million people). Stage 1 would be a "pilot stage" covering about 10-15%&#13;
of the beneficiaries; following a review of the findings of implementation experience and of&#13;
an independent monitoring and evaluation process, Stage 2 for the remaining work would be&#13;
designed and would proceed to implementation; independent monitoring and evaluation would&#13;
continue. Agreement was reached at negotiations that implementation will proceed in&#13;
accordance with "Policy Guidelines for the Implementation" (see Annex 14) and further that&#13;
certification of conmliance with these Policy Guidelines will accompanv each withdrawal&#13;
reguest with respect to this aspect of the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(f)   Addition of structural features to improve the stability of five existing sewage pumping&#13;
stations; and&#13;
(g)  Conveyance system improvements.&#13;
3.09   Project supDort and technical assistance will be provided in the form of consultants'&#13;
services for the tasks listed below in each of three categories. This technical assistance, its estimated&#13;
gross costs (in US$ million in parentheses) and its classification per GP 8.40 are as follows:&#13;

Categorv 1: roject Support&#13;
3.10 Supervision of Construction of the Worli and Bandra Outfalls. the Bandra Pumping&#13;
Station, and the Ghatkopr Influent Tunnel. An ongoing contract, which expires in 30-Jun-96,&#13;
provides for construction supervision by international Consultants. As a condition of effectiveness&#13;
MCGB will either: (i) extend the duration of this contract; or (iu) before 31-Jul-95 furnish in a&#13;
form satisfactory to the Bank, consultant recruitment documentation and a consultant&#13;
recruitment program to ensure continuity of the provision of such services. Under the ongoing&#13;
contract, and its extension or substitute contract, the consultant will be designated as the "engineer",&#13;
as reflected in the general conditions of contract, for the construction of the Worli and Bandra&#13;
outfalls, and (ultimately) in the general conditions of contract for the construction of the Bandra&#13;
pumping station, and works to overcome siltation is the Ghatkopar Influent Tunnel. Assurances were&#13;
also obtained at negotiations that consultants will also supervise the construction of the Ghatkonar&#13;
and Bhandup lagoons, the slum sanitation schemes and the pmnping station structural&#13;
modifications but may not be designated as the "engineer" for this work, unless such an arrangement&#13;
is requested by MCGB.&#13;
3.11   Upgrading WSSD Operation and Maintenance Practices. The level of maintenance of the&#13;
existing sewerage system has been consistently poor, lacking adequately trained and skilled staff,&#13;
suitable facilities and appropriate plant and equipment. In addition, preventive maintenance&#13;
procedures are inadequate and the organizational structure of that section of WSSD dealing with&#13;
sewerage maintenance needs reform.&#13;
3.12   MCGB has agreed to address this issue with the assistance of suitably qualified consultants,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, to implement a comprehensive study and to introduce improved operation and&#13;
maintenance practices and organizational reforms. The consultant recruitment documentation for this&#13;
study are available in the project file (Annex 15) and the award of this consulting services contract&#13;
was made a condition for negotiations.&#13;
3.13   Topoeranhic and Condition Surveys of the Conveyance System. These surveys would be&#13;
implemented in connection with the component for the Conveyance System Remedial Works [para&#13;
3.08(g) above]. The topographic survey would enable record plans of the conveyance system to be&#13;
prepared and would be followed by a condition survey of the system to provide input for the&#13;
preparation of a program for remedial works. Requests for proposal for these surveys are available in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
the project file (Annex 15) and the award of this consulting services contract was also a condition for&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
3.14   The Slum Sanitation Technical Assistance relates to the physical component described in&#13;
para 3.08(e); the program and some further details of this technical assistance are described in&#13;
Annex 14. An understanding, in the form of agreed terms of reference, was obtained at&#13;
negotiations for this TA which will comprise, in those slums selected:&#13;
(1)   publicity for the slum sanitation schemes;&#13;
(2)   the work of multi-disciplinary teams (social surveys; physical surveys and the assessment&#13;
of physically feasible and economical technical options; beneficiary consultations for the&#13;
purposes of the determination of community preferences, of beneficiary contributions to&#13;
investments and to subsequent operation and maintenance);&#13;
(3)   independent monitoring and evaluation of both the procedures and the activities&#13;
described in (1) and (2) above and reporting thereon;&#13;
Category 2: Studies, Site Investigations and Engineering for Second Stage Works&#13;
3.15   The Environmental Impact Assessment (Annex 11) that has been carried out for the first stage&#13;
of development of sewage treatment and disposal facilities to serve the Greater Bombay area,&#13;
confirms that higher levels of treatment and/or improved disposal methods will be required to meet&#13;
future coastal water quality standards. Planning for these improvements in sewage treatment and&#13;
disposal facilities has, therefore, been included in the proposed project in the form of: (i) the Bombay&#13;
Coastal Water Quality Study (para 3.17) which is under implementation; and (ii) the Second Stage&#13;
Program, which includes provision for feasibility studies, and engineering designs for sewage&#13;
treatment and disposal facilities in six service areas. The agreed schedule for implementation of the&#13;
Second Stage Program and a description of the scope of each of the studies in the Program are&#13;
detailed in Annex 5.&#13;
Category 3: Complementary Studies&#13;
3.16   These studies have been, or are being implemented under separate financing in the preparation&#13;
of components of the proposed project and of the program of Second Stage works.&#13;
3.17   The Bombay Coastal Water Oualitv Study. This study is financed under a Japanese grant&#13;
and is being implemented by India's National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)&#13;
under the direction of MCGB. The study supplements the hydrographic work carried out as part of&#13;
the 1979 Master Plan and extends the work under a recent study implemented by NEERI, as part of&#13;
the Environmental Impact Assessment. The study will estimate receiving water quality that would&#13;
result from various lengths of outfalls discharging to the Arabian Sea, and/or sewage treatment&#13;
options, for Worli and Bandra service areas, in addition to the effects of various outfall locations for&#13;
Malad and Versova service areas. The extended study will examine the quality of receiving waters&#13;
along the coastline (to about 8 to 10 km from the shore line) from a point about 20 km north of&#13;
Malad creek to a point about 7 km south of the Worli outfall. A further study will extend the water&#13;
quality studies of Thane creek almost to a point at which the creek reaches the sea (adjacent to&#13;
Bombay harbor).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
3.18   The results of the study will enable MCGB to assess the improvement in coastal waters which&#13;
would result from various methods of sewage treatment and disposal, and the effects of extending the&#13;
outfalls to various distances from the shore line under the Second Stage Program, in order to satisfy&#13;
future environmental standards. Results of the study would provide the "starting point" and primary&#13;
input for engineering feasibility studies for sewage treatment and disposal facilities to be constructed&#13;
in the Second Stage Program to serve the six drainage areas (Annex 5).&#13;
3.19   The remaining three complementary studies that have been implemented to resolve issues&#13;
arising from deficiencies in some of the existing facilities as outlined above. These three studies&#13;
address the following items: Bandra Purning Station [para 3.08(b)1: Ghatkopar Influent Tunnel [para&#13;
3.08(g)1: and Pumping Station Structural Stability [paras 3.08(f)1. Reports on these studies are&#13;
available in the Project File (Annex 15).&#13;

Project Cost&#13;
3.21   The project has a total estimated cost of US$295.6 million, or US$274.3 million excluding&#13;
taxes and duties of US$21.3 million. The estimates take account of the bids received for the&#13;
construction of the Worli and Bandra marine outfalls; for other components the bids are based on data&#13;
gathered by WSSD and consultants from similar works implemented throughout the world, adjusted to&#13;
reflect conditions in India and to a January 1995 base.&#13;
3.22   Physical contingencies of 25% have been allowed for all civil, mechanical and electrical&#13;
works, based on the following rationale:&#13;
*  Worli and Bandra marine outfalls         :  Inherent uncertainties associated&#13;
and Ghatkopar influent tunnel            :  with tunnel construction.&#13;
*  Aerated lagoons at Ghatkopar             :  Uncertainty in the location of&#13;
and Bhandup                              :  borrow areas yielding laterite&#13;
for embankment construction.&#13;
*  Bandra pumping station                   :  Magnitude and complexity of work.&#13;
*  Slum sanitation                          :  The programmatic nature of the component&#13;
and the resulting difficulties of cost&#13;
estimation.&#13;
*  Pumping station structural               :  Preliminary status of preparation.&#13;
improvements and conveyance&#13;
system improvements.&#13;
Physical contingencies of 10% have been included for all technical assistance, studies, site&#13;
investigations and engineering required for the Second Stage Program.&#13;
3.23   To provide for inflation throughout the project implementation period (estimated at 71½ years -&#13;
Annexes 4 and 5) the following price escalation rates have been used for local expenditures: 9.0% for&#13;
1995, 8.5% for 1996, 8.0% for 1997, 7.0% for 1998 and 6.0% thereafter. For foreign expenditures&#13;
the escalation rates used are 1.5% for 1995, 1.8% for 1996, 2.6% for 1997 and 2.5% per year&#13;
thereafter. The cost estimates are given in detail in Annex 4 and are summarized on the following&#13;
page.&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
3.24   The Bank would finance 70% of the total project cost, net of taxes and duties; this amounts in&#13;
total to US$192.0 million. A Bank loan (US$167.0 million) and an IDA Credit (US$25.0 million)&#13;
would be made to the Govermment of India, which would make the proceeds available to the&#13;
Government of Maharashtra in accordance with GOI's standard arrangements for development&#13;
assistance to the States of India. In summary:&#13;

Implementation&#13;
3.25   The project will be implemented by MCGB's WSSD with the assistance of foreign and local&#13;
consultants. The international consultants would be designated as the "Engineer" for major&#13;
components of the project, including construction of the Worli and Bandra outfalls, the Bandra&#13;
pumping station and the facilities to control siltation in the Ghatkopar Influent Tunnel. At&#13;
negotiations, MCGB confirmed the understanding that it will appoint international consultants&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, according to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. to supervise&#13;
construction of the Worli and Bandra outfalls, Bandra pumping station, and Ghatkopar influent tunnel.&#13;
MCGB also gave assurances that it will appoint local consultants. acceptable to the Bank, according to&#13;
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. to supervise construction of the Ghatkopar and Bhandup&#13;
lagoons. the slum sanitation component, structural improvements in five pumping stations and&#13;
conveyance system improvements (para 3.10).&#13;
3.26   The conditions for negotiations included:&#13;
(a) Worli and Bandra Outfalls     Bid Evaluation Report furnished/approved by the Bank&#13;
(b) Bandra Pumping Station        Furnish Bid Documents to Bank for Review&#13;
(c) Ghatkopar and Bhandup Lagoons Invite bids from Prequalified Contractors&#13;
It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that contracts for these major works (for which the total base&#13;
cost estimate of civil works is US$126.8 million or 57% of the total base cost) will have been&#13;
awarded by loan effectiveness. In view of this unusually advanced level of project preparedness, the&#13;
project implementation schedule has been reduced from the Bank-wide sector disbursement profile of&#13;
8 '2 years to 7'h years. Project costs and financing have, therefore, been calculated on a 7½' year&#13;
implementation period.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.27   During preparation of the project, in response to a request from MCGB, the Bank indicated&#13;
that it would not object to bids being invited for two alternative outfall designs:&#13;
(a)    based on the use of concrete pipes laid in a dredged trench on the sea bed and&#13;
protected with rock armor (similar to the construction previously attempted but with&#13;
significant technical changes); and&#13;
(b)    tunnels constructed some 30 meters below the sea bed with risers and diffuser ports&#13;
for sewage dispersal.&#13;
Both designs: (i) incorporated tapered diffuser sections at the terminal end with risers and diffuser&#13;
ports for sewage dispersal; (ii) incorporated features to facilitate their future extension.&#13;
3.28   In the earlier outfall construction endeavor (paras 2.15-2.16) tunnels were not considered as a&#13;
possible form of outfall construction. However, comparatively recent developments in tunnel&#13;
construction technology, and the advances in tunnel boring machinery, have made it an economical&#13;
option. The cost of the dredged trench and concrete pipe alternative was estimated to be considerably&#13;
more than that of the tunnel alternative. However, to eliminate doubt, it was agreed that the final&#13;
selection of method would be based on the bid prices received for each alternative. The bids received&#13;
in December 1994, from bid documents approved by the Bank, have now shown the cost of the&#13;
tunnel alternative to be substantially less than that of dredged trench and concrete pipe. The tunnel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
alternative has therefore been selected for construction. As a condition for Loan negotiations, MCGB&#13;
completed the bid evaluation and review process for the Worli and Bandra outfalls, and submit to the&#13;
Bank a recommendation for contract award. This bid evaluation had been received and reviewed by&#13;
the Bank, and a "no obiection" issued for the award of the contract. In addition, as a condition of&#13;
Loan effectiveness, MCGB would award the contract, in accordance with a Bank-approved bid&#13;
evaluation, for construction of the Worli and Bandra outfalls.&#13;
3.29 The five major civil works contracts (Annex 4) will be awarded to prequalified contractors on&#13;
the basis on international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Guidelines on&#13;
Procurement and using Bank standard bidding documents. These contracts, (and their estimated gross&#13;
costs) are: (i) the Worli and Bandra outfalls (US$107.9 million), for which bids have been received&#13;
(paras 2.13 and 2.16); (ii) the Bandra pumping station (US$31.5 million); the (iii) Bhandup and (iv)&#13;
Ghatkopar lagoons (US$13.7 million each); and (v) facilities to control siltation in the Ghatkopar&#13;
tunnel (US$12.9 million). A preferential margin of up to 7½ % may be granted to local bidders in&#13;
evaluating these civil works bids.&#13;
3.30   Civil works for: (i) the Slum Sanitation Program (US$23.9 million gross cost); and for (ii) the&#13;
Conveyance System Remedial works (US$26.1 million gross cost) will be broken down into a number&#13;
of small contracts under local competitive bidding procedures (LCB), acceptable to the Bank, since&#13;
the work will be spread over a wide area and will be carried out over an extended period. The&#13;
remaining two civil works contracts: (iii) pumping station structural stability restoration (US$4.4&#13;
million gross cost); and (iv) other Ghatkopar influent tunnel repair (US$1.0 million gross cost) will&#13;
also be awarded under LCB procedures.&#13;
3.31   The three contracts for the supply and insallation of mechanical and electrical e tuipmen [(i)&#13;
Bandra Pumping Station - US$5.7 million gross cost; (ii) Bhandup Aerated Lagoon - US$6.0 million&#13;
gross cost; (iii) Ghatkopar Aerated Lagoon - US$6.0 million gross cost, totalling US$17.7 million&#13;
gross cost will be awarded under ICB using the Bank's standard documents. In evaluating bids for&#13;
equipment and materials, local manufacturers participating in international bidding may be granted a&#13;
preferential margin of up to 15% of the cif costs of the competing imports, or the existing customs&#13;
duty, whichever is lower.&#13;
3.32   Four contracts for consultants services (Annex 4) for: (i) for planning, design and&#13;
construction supervision of the civil, mechanical and electrical works described above - estimated&#13;
gross cost US$13.3 million; (ii) studies and training on sewerage system operation and maintenance -&#13;
estimated gross cost US$2.5 million; (iii) condition surveys and remedial measures formulation on the&#13;
conveyance system - estimated gross cost US$1.8 million; and (iv) technical and social services&#13;
related to the slum sanitation schemes - estimated gross cost US$2.2 million - will be awarded in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and the Bank's standard consulting&#13;
services contract. Similarly, consultants services for feasibility studies and engineering designs for&#13;
the Second Stage Program - estimated gross cost US$23.0 million - will be awarded in accordance&#13;
with Bank Guidelines as described.&#13;
3.33   Review by the Bank will be (and has been) required of prequalification documents prior to an&#13;
invitation to prequalify, prequalification evaluation reports prior to prequalification, bid documents&#13;
prior to bid invitation and bid evaluation reports prior to contract award for: (a) all ICB contracts&#13;
(both goods and works); (b) all LCB works contracts having a value of more than US$1.0 million.&#13;
Review by the Bank will also be required of all: (c) consultant recruitment documentation [including&#13;
shortlists and terms of reference] prior to an invitation for proposals; (d) proposal evaluation reports&#13;
prior to negotiations; and (e) draft "as-negotiated" consultant contracts prior to contract signature.&#13;

Disbursement&#13;
3.35   The Bank funds of US$192.0 million will be disbursed over 7½/2 years. No disbursements&#13;
will be made against land or administrative costs, or against taxes and duties in India. Disbursements&#13;
against civil works and goods-equipment contracts with a value of over US$1.0 million equivalent&#13;
will be fully documented. Disbursements for consultants' services will also be fully documented for&#13;
contracts with firms for US$100,000 or more and for contracts with individuals for US$50,000 or&#13;
more. Disbursements against other expenditures will be made against statements of expenditure&#13;
(SOEs). Supporting documentation for expenditures disbursed against SOEs will not be submitted to&#13;
the Bank but will be retained by MCGB and will be made available to Bank staff for review upon&#13;
request. Agreement was reached at negotiations that such SOE expenditures will be audited annually&#13;
by auditors acceptable to the Bank (see also para 5.12). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
withdrawl applications with respect to slum sanitation schemes will be accompanied by a policv&#13;
compliance certification [2ara 3.08(e)1.&#13;
3.36   To facilitate disbursements under this project, a Special Account will be established in the&#13;
Reserve Bank of India with an authorized allocation of up to US$8.0 million equivalent to cover four&#13;
months of estimated average requirements for Bank-financed items. Replenishment will be made&#13;
quarterly or whenever the Special Account is drawn down by about 50% of the initial deposit, which&#13;
ever comes earlier. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Special Account will also be&#13;
audited annually by auditors acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.37          Retroactive financing has been proposed of up to SDR 7.6 million, (about 6% of the&#13;
Credit and Loan) for advance payments to become due on the contracts for the construction of the&#13;
submarine outfalls after June 15, 1995. This is linked to the Bank's receipt of a bid evaluation report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
on bids for these outfalls having been a condition for negotiations and to the expectation of bid&#13;
validity expiry prior to effectiveness. This retroactive financing is recommended.&#13;
3.38   The Loan closing date will be December 31, 2002.&#13;
3.39   An estimated schedule of disbursements is in Annex 7. The estimated disbursements by&#13;
Disbursement Category are as follows:&#13;

Operation and Maintenance&#13;
3.40   When completed, project works which form an integral part of the entire sewerage system,&#13;
will be operated and maintained by the Water Supply and Sewerage Department (WSSD) of MCGB.&#13;
Historically, WSSD's level of maintenance of the water supply system has been acceptable, with the&#13;
exception of the distribution system and consumer metering which are operated without adequate&#13;
attention to reduction of unaccounted-for water. However, the level of maintenance of the existing&#13;
sewerage system has been poor; the staff have been inadequately managed and trained and more&#13;
skilled staff, additional facilities, plant and equipment may be required.&#13;
3.41   MCGB's WSSD wishes to address these issues and technical assistance from suitably-qualified&#13;
consultants for this purpose is included in the Project (paras 3.11 and 3.12). MCGB issued a letter of&#13;
acceptance of a proposal as a condition of loan negotiations and the signing of the contract is a&#13;
condition of effectiveness.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
3.42   The orderly management and supervision of project activities by MCGB and WSSD (and their&#13;
consultants) will require the systematic recording of information and the periodic preparation of&#13;
reports which present and analyze such information and conclude with actions required (and by&#13;
whom) to address specific problems which are identified. A guide to topics for such reporting is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
given in Annex 8 and includes the Monitoring Indicators set out in Annex 12 and the Enviromnental&#13;
Monitoring and Mitigation Plans set out at the end of Annex 11.&#13;
3.43   Project supervision by the Bank is for the purpose of reviewing compliance with the legal&#13;
agreements and to furnish assistance in the resolution of problems which may arise. Its effectiveness&#13;
and efficiency is much aided by the availability of good quality quarterly progress reports such as&#13;
described in para 3.42. It is estimated that project supervision by the Bank will require about 128&#13;
staff-weeks over the life of the project, of which about 45 staff-weeks will be at headquarters for&#13;
review of progress reports, procurement processing and correspondence, and 83 staff-weeks will be in&#13;
the field. The supervision staff time inputs will be greater than average during the first three years of&#13;
the project's life and correspondingly less than average thereafter. The average supervision staff-&#13;
weeks per year are estimated at 17.1. A Bank supervision plan (timing and staffing) is also given in&#13;
Annex 8.&#13;
Land Acquisition - Resettlement and Rehabilitation&#13;
3.44   Land Acquisition. MCGB reports that all of the land required for this project has been&#13;
acquired during the Second and Third Water Supply and Sewerage Projects. No resettlement is&#13;
required. The Slum Sanitation Schemes are, by definition, to be conducted on those slums which&#13;
occupy municipally-owned lands (para 3.08(e)).&#13;
3.45   Resettlement. No resettlement is required for project implementation excepting possible for&#13;
the implementation of slum sanitation schemes. Here, the beneficiary consultation process is designed&#13;
to ensure, inter alia, that any resettlement is voluntary. Assurances were obtained at negotiations&#13;
that the slum sanitation implementation will follow the "Policy Guidelines for Implementing&#13;
Slum Sanitation Schemes" (Annex 14) which reflect this requirement that any resettlement be&#13;
voluntary. Additionally, assurances were obtained at negotiations all withdrawal requests with&#13;
respect to slum sanitation schemes will be accompanied by a certification of compliance with the&#13;
"Policy Guidelines" described.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.46   The preparation of the Project included a comprehensive environmental assessment (EA)&#13;
process embracing a variety of studies, public consultation and the development of environmental&#13;
mitigation and monitoring plans. The methods and findings of the EA studies and the resulting&#13;
environmental and monitoring plans are reported in some detail in Annex 11.&#13;
3.47   Additionally, there is an ongoing "Bombay Coastal Water Quality Study" financed by a&#13;
Japanese grant and being conducted by the same organization (India's National Environmental&#13;
Engineering Research Institute - NEERI) as conducted the EA.&#13;
Monitoring Indicators&#13;
3.48   The performance of WSSD and the project will be monitored by indicators as generally&#13;
outlined in Annex 12. These will be valuable to WSSD in managing the Project and their operations.&#13;
Additionally, there are the environmental mitigation and monitoring plans presented at the end of&#13;
Annex 11. It is proposed that these be reported on by WSSD to the Bank at quarterly intervals as an&#13;
element of the overall quarterly reporting (para 3.42).&#13;

IV THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY&#13;
The Water Supply and Sewerage Department&#13;
4.01   MCGB, the beneficiary, established under the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act of 1888, is&#13;
the largest Municipal Corporation in India. The council of elected representatives is responsible for&#13;
the provision of all municipal services including water supply and sewerage. MCGB maintains&#13;
considerable autonomy in relation to the provision of municipal services through amendments to the&#13;
1888 Act which have been effected by GoM legislation.&#13;
4.02   The implementing agency for the project, the Water Supply and Sewerage Department&#13;
(WSSD) of MCGB, was established in 1973 by an official order of the Municipal Commissioner and&#13;
is responsible to the MCGB Standing Committee for planning, development, operation and&#13;
maintenance of the water supply and sewerage services. Prior to the establishment of WSSD, these&#13;
services were administered by several committees and departments of MCGB.&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
4.03   The Municipal Commissioner, appointed by GOM, is the principal officer of the Municipal&#13;
Corporation of Greater Bombay (MCGB) and retains overall responsibility for WSSD. The&#13;
Municipal Commissioner has traditionally been a senior civil servant from the Indian Administrative&#13;
Service with wide experience in state and local administration. WSSD is organized into five separate&#13;
sections (Annex 9) for management purposes, each headed by a Chief Engineer, each of whom is&#13;
responsible to the Deputy Municipal Commissioner of Special Engineering or the Deputy Municipal&#13;
Comnissioner Engineering, as appropriate. The Finance and Administration section is headed by an&#13;
Additional Municipal Chief Accountant (see Section V).&#13;
4.04   Project management of both the Second and Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Projects was not satisfactory, particularly with regard to the sewerage components of the projects (see&#13;
paras 2.15-2.17 and Annex 13). The establishment of a special project management unit (or "cell")&#13;
under the Third Project, designed to improve planning and coordination in support of section heads of&#13;
WSSD, did not prove to be highly successful. In 1991, following the Bank's request for the&#13;
appointment of a more experienced and senior manager to take control of both the Third Bombay&#13;
Water Supply Project and Sewerage Project, and works remaining unfinished from the Second&#13;
Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project, the management responsibility was assigned to the&#13;
Additional Municipal Commissioner, a senior civil servant and from the Indian Administrative&#13;
Service. This arrangement continues and has resulted in a marked improvement in the overall&#13;
management of WSSD.&#13;
Proiect Management and Organization&#13;
4.05   Despite this steady improvement in project implementation, a great deal of the back-log in&#13;
construction and a large number of remedial works items from the Second Bombay Water Supply and&#13;
Sewerage Project have been be completed. All of these items are now identified, quantified to the&#13;
extent possible and form part of an agreed program, much of which has been implemented (Annex 1).&#13;
However, a substantial and sustained effort will be necessary to achieve a completed and effective&#13;
sewerage system to reliably serve the Greater Bombay area.&#13;
4.06   Given the level of consulting services support proposed and agreed (see paras 3.10 to 3.19)&#13;
WSSD will be capable of implementing the project provided that an Additional Municipal&#13;
Commissioner, or an officer with similar experience and seniority, remains in charge of project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
management. Agreement was reached at negotiations that MCGB will maintain a Project&#13;
Management Unit in WSSD for the management of the Project which is led. organized and staffed in&#13;
a manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Additionally assurances were obtained that MCGB will: (i) designate a group of people having&#13;
appropriate qualifications and experience individually in either technical matters or social science to&#13;
manage the slum sanitation schemes; (ii) MCGB will designate at least one procurement officer in the&#13;
PMU, of suitable qualifications and experience; and (iii) MCGB will designate at least one&#13;
environmental officer, of suitable qualification, in the PMU to coordinate and supervise the actions&#13;
described in para 4.07 below.&#13;
4.07   The management of the Project will include the implementation of the environmental&#13;
mitigation and monitoring plan which is given at the end of Annex 11. As presented, much of the&#13;
activity is variously assigned to the consulting engineers, to the consultant who conducted the EA&#13;
(NEERI) or to the construction contractors by appropriate provisions in their contracts; however,&#13;
some remaining activity is assigned directly to MCGB. Agreement was reached at negotiations that&#13;
MCGB will implement the environmental mitigation and monitoring plans as presented in Annex 11.&#13;
As indicated in these plans, MCGB will make appropriate provisions in contracts with consultants and&#13;
contractors for the delegation of this responsibility subject to MCGB supervision and overall&#13;
management.&#13;
Training&#13;
4.08   Training programs initiated under the Second and Third Water Supply and Sewerage Projects&#13;
will continue during implementation of the proposed Project. The MCGB Training Establishment at&#13;
Borivili under the direction of MCGB Civic Training Institute and Research Center, has annual&#13;
training programs applicable to water supply and sewerage operations. Much of this work is based on&#13;
reliable, state-of-the-art materials and manuals originating from British Water International.&#13;
4.09   An extensive training component is to be provided under the Project to upgrade the operation&#13;
and maintenance levels of the entire sewerage system for Bombay (paras 3.11, 3.12 and Annex 2).&#13;
This will include retraining operators and artisans in standard mechanical, electrical and electronic&#13;
skills in addition to training in the use and operation of plant and equipment for the operation and&#13;
maintenance of sewerage collection, conveyance and treatment systems.&#13;
4.10   The project will continue the support of overseas training of MCGB personnel to improve job&#13;
skills and operation and management efficiency under the umbrella of the consulting services&#13;
described in para 4.09. Training of MCGB officers at Indian training institutes will continue under&#13;
the project. Such institutes include the Indian Institute of Technology, and the National Institute for&#13;
Training in Industrial Engineering.&#13;
Insurance&#13;
4.11   At negotiations assurances were obtained that:&#13;
(a) materials and equipment for the project will be insured and that all other public utility&#13;
risks will continue to be borne by internal insurance funds;&#13;
(b) existing separate fire/accident and third party insurance funds of WSSD in respect of other&#13;
risks will be maintained by annual contributions by WSSD in accordance with principles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
agreed for the Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project, which are acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
V FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
Recent Financial Performance&#13;
5.01   MCGB's Water Supply and Sewerage Department (WSSD) became a separate accounting&#13;
entity within MCGB in 1974. This was a condition of credit effectiveness of the First Bombay Water&#13;
Supply and Sewerage Project (FY73). Separate funds and accounts were established for WSSD in&#13;
1975, and the Department began reporting its financial position and results of operations using&#13;
conimercial accounting principles in 1979. Throughout the Second (FY79) and Third (FY86)&#13;
Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Projects, WSSD's financial management and accounting and its&#13;
compliance with financial performance and audit covenants has been very satisfactory. The financial&#13;
performance covenant in all of these prior projects has been to require WSSD to contribute, as a&#13;
minimum, a fixed proportion of the investments from surplus cash flows; this proportion in the First&#13;
Project was 33 % at the outset thence 40% which proportion has remained the covenanted requirement&#13;
under the Second and Third Projects. During the last fifteen years, water and sewerage investmnents&#13;
accounted for over 50% of MCGB's total investment program.&#13;
5.02   Annex 10 presents a summary of historic and projected future financial statements for WSSD.&#13;
Included are statements of income and expenditure, sources and application of funds, and balance&#13;
sheets and the current tariff structure for WSSD. Tables IV and V in Annex 10 provide detailed&#13;
statements on revenues and expenditures.&#13;
5.03   Over the past 5 years WSSD financial position has been good. WSSD's earnings performance&#13;
for the last four fiscal years is summarized in the following table. It can be noted that, overall, both&#13;
the return on fixed assets and total assets have improved and are at a very satisfactory level.&#13;

5.04   Liquiditv. The liquidity position of WSSD has been consistently good over the past five&#13;
years. Its current ratio has been good ranging from 2.7 to 3.1 during the last four years. Increases&#13;
in the cash position occurred mainly because WSSD's investment program proceeded more slowly&#13;
than anticipated. A high level of receivables is mainly due to old, disputed billings. However,&#13;
WSSD's collection rate and efficiency has improved over the last two fiscal years from 72.1 % % in&#13;
FY92 to 75.4% of billings in FY94.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
5.05   Covenant under Third Bombay Water SuPPlV Project. Under the Third Project WSSD has&#13;
been able to maintain tariffs at levels sufficient to generate annual cash surpluses to cover at least&#13;
40% of its capital expenditures and debt service in any given year. This financial target has been&#13;
achieved for the past five years with tariff increases on April 1, 1993 and on April 1, 1994. In&#13;
addition, WSSD has been able to successfully establish and annually contribute to a specific cash&#13;
account which was used for the replacement and rehabilitation of capital assets. Finally, WSSD&#13;
annually reviewed and updated the Operational Action Plan in manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Tariff Analysis&#13;
5.06   The following table shows the tariff structure for FY88 through FY95 and the percentages of&#13;
WSSD's revenues from water and sewerage charges, water and sewerage taxes and water and&#13;

5.07    WSSD has a graduated tariff structure. Charges are levied for metered supply and taxes on&#13;
unmetered supply. The sewerage charges are 50% of water charges. In addition to water and&#13;
sewerage charges/or taxes, a water benefit tax and sewerage benefit tax is charged based on the&#13;
annual rental value (or rateable value-RV) of the property. For water bills, the domestic sector&#13;
currently pays 10% of the RV whereas the industrial sector pays 20% of the RV. For sewerage&#13;
tariffs/charges, the domestic sector currently pays 6% of the RV whereas the industrial sector pays&#13;
12% of the RV. The compound water charge is levied on those consumers whose consumption&#13;
cannot be metered and is based on a lump sum basis and the type of industry. Unmetered supplies&#13;
are paid through a water and sewerage tax based on the rateable/rental value of the property. A&#13;
sewerage tax can also be levied on properties which are unsewered but have metered water supply.&#13;
This tax was introduced in FY75 and was used to finance some of the capital expenditures of MCGB.&#13;
In cases where supply is metered but meters are out of order, consumption is calculated based on the&#13;
corresponding period of the previous year. For FY93, charges to both domestic and industrial&#13;
consumers increased by 50% whereas in FY94, 20% tariff increases were mainly in the domestic&#13;
sector. There are no charges for water supplied to the urban poor through public standposts. Due to&#13;
the high commercial rates for water and sewerage which users have been willing to pay, overall water&#13;
and sewerage revenues have been fully sufficient to support operations, maintenance and a significant&#13;
portion of new investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
5.08   Industrial and commercial consumers are currently paying approximately 8 to 40 times more&#13;
to those charges to the domestic sector depending on the type of industry. Through cross-subsidy&#13;
tariff rates, industrial sector generates approximately 75% of WSSD's total revenues. MCGB meets&#13;
all of industrial water demand but only approximately 55 % of domestic demand (Annex 10-Table VI).&#13;
Some 60% of WSSD revenues are from metered supply. The tariff increase of approximately 30-&#13;
35% for all categories in April 1, 1993 and the additional supply of water of 90 mld from the Third&#13;
Bombay Water and Sewerage Project led to a 50% increase in WSSD's revenues during that FY94.&#13;
The second tariff increase of only 20% for the domestic sector on April 1, 1994 led to another&#13;
increase in WSSD's revenues of 20% during FY95. Despite these increases, the level of domestic&#13;
tariff are quite low compared to other metropolitan cities in India. Even for a relatively affluent&#13;
domestic consumer, the bill would not exceed about Rs. 35 per month. A Rs. 25-30 monthly bill&#13;
would be approximately 2% of an average family income, suggesting that higher domestic tariffs&#13;
would still be affordable. Also subsidizing the domestic sector excessively does not promote water&#13;
conservation. Accordingly the Bank will continue to encourage MCGB to review and revise its&#13;
domestic tariff levels.&#13;
Customer Receivables&#13;
5.09   Under the Project agreement for the Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project, the&#13;
audit report notes that WSSD is obligated to reduce its customer accounts receivables to no more than&#13;
20% of billings. The aging classification of the receivables as of March 31, 1994 is as follows:&#13;
Rupees million      (% of total)&#13;
Less than one year                              Rs  872.0            37.8%&#13;
More than one year-less than two years          Rs 218.3              9.5%&#13;
More that two years-less than three years       Rs 222.0              9.6%&#13;
More than three years                           Rs 995.9             43.1%&#13;
Total                             Rs 2308.2            100.0%&#13;
5.10   A major accumulation of arrears has been a problem for a long time. Some 43 % of customer&#13;
receivables are more than three years overdue. These arrears are from Central and State&#13;
Governments: Rs 177 million (some going back to 1950) and the Bombay Textile Mills: Rs 122&#13;
million (accumulated from 1965). WSSD is reluctant to write off any of the larger arrears as it does&#13;
not want to prejudice long standing litigation. The 20% target has proven to be unrealistic given the&#13;
timing of billing and collection on a quarterly basis. One underlying problem is the lack of&#13;
established policies and procedures for writing-off doubtful old disputed accounts, rather than with&#13;
poor collections of billing in the year that they are due. In fact, WSSD collection efficiency has&#13;
improved for the first two categories. The objection to not writing off doubtful accounts is that it&#13;
could overstate WSSD's net income in any given year, and as the doubtful accounts have&#13;
accumulated, it is beginning to overstate the WSSD's liquidity position. The Bank will work with&#13;
WSSD in developing and implementing a reasonable write-off policy for doubtful or disputed accounts&#13;
without jeopardizing the litigation on individual overdue accounts.&#13;
5.11   Billing and Collection. WSSD billings are prepared by the data processing unit of MCGB;&#13;
the system is well controlled and operated. Under the Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Project, technical assistance was provided to develop computer programs to automatically produce&#13;
monthly delinquency reports, and to automatically print reminder letters to customers whose bills are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
over 30 days in arrears. This has proven to be effective as the collection rate of WSSD has improved&#13;
considerably over the last two fiscal years from 72. 1% % in FY92 to 75.4% of billings in FY94.&#13;
While this compares favorably to other water utilities in India, there is clearly much room for further&#13;
improvement.&#13;
Accounts and Audit&#13;
5.12    The accounts of WSSD are well designed and prepared and are audited annually by the&#13;
Municipal Chief Auditor of MCGB. His report is prepared and submitted to the MCGB, and&#13;
forwarded to the Bank normally within six months of the fiscal year end. Under the Third Bombay&#13;
Water Supply and Sewerage Project, this covenant has been consistently met. In recent years the&#13;
reports have been completed and have addressed important financial and operational issues and have&#13;
appeared to be both independent and reliable. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the reDort&#13;
of the Municipal Chief Auditor on WSSD accounts will continue to be furnished to the Bank within&#13;
six months of the end of WSSD's fiscal year (see also para 3.35).&#13;
5.13    The Office of the Municipal Chief Auditor is a large operation within MCGB staffed with&#13;
more than 500 people. The work and the reports of the office has been commendable as the audit&#13;
programs and procedures have been formally reviewed and updated. MCGB has expanded it use of&#13;
computers in maintaining financial records, and advances have been made in the auditing field as a&#13;
result of a technical assistance component in the Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project.&#13;
The TA component under the Third Project also included the design and documentation of policies&#13;
and procedures for the preparation and review and maintenance of audit workpapers; this has been&#13;
implemented well.&#13;

5.15   In general, the past financial performance by WSSD has been good with high returns on net&#13;
fixed assets increasing from 16.27% in FY92 to 23.10% in FY95 which is high compared to other&#13;
public water utilities in India. WSSD has consistently generated an operating surplus over the past&#13;
four fiscal years. During this time it has had an operating ratio between 1.5-2.0 leaving sufficient&#13;
cash to finance capital works. Debt/equity, liquidity, and profitability ratios have also improved&#13;
during this period. The same pattern is expected to continue during FY95-FY2000 with effective&#13;
tariff increases of about 4.7% in FY98, 33.8% in FY99, and 12.2% in FY2000 to bring average&#13;
incremental revenues in line with costs. With this, MCGB would be able to meet the targeted internal&#13;
cash generation of 35% of its investments.&#13;
5.16. Internal Cash Generation. The projected financial performance of WSSD is predicated upon&#13;
WSSD's continuing to satisfy the kind of cash generation covenant used in the First, Second, and&#13;
Third Projects. Agreement was reached during negotiations that MCGB will revise tariffs as required&#13;
to ensure that internallv-generated funds are sufficient to cover at least 35% of its capital expenditures&#13;
in any year. Also, to minimize the effects of any project implementation delays on the effectiveness&#13;
of this covenant, a,greement was also reached that cash generation percentages in any year would&#13;
apply to either actual annual capital expenditures, or to a stigulated plan of annual expenditures.&#13;
whichever is greater. The stipulated plan of annual expenditures corresponds to the seven and a half&#13;
year implementation schedule for the project.&#13;
5.17   Management of Cash Surpluses. Increasingly, MCGB's WSSD is faced with the need to plan,&#13;
finance and execute the replacement and/or rehabilitation of physical assets. WSSD will be&#13;
generating a significant and necessary cash surplus during the implementation of this Project and&#13;
thereafter. However, this surplus will be needed and should be used to implement a planned program&#13;
of replacement and/or rehabilitation of physical assets. To aid a systematic allocation of funds for&#13;
this purpose (as was done in the Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project) and their prudent&#13;
use, agreement was reached at negotiations that WSSD will maintain a specific cash account to cover&#13;
the planned annual costs of asset replacement and/or rehabilitation and that annual operating surpluses&#13;
(after meeting 35 % of the capital expenditure and allowing for sufficient unrestricted cash to maintain&#13;
a quick ratio of not more than 2) will be deposited in this account.&#13;

VI PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
6.01   The potential health and environmental benefits of improving the disposal of more than 60%&#13;
of the sewage from the Greater Bombay area are considered substantial even though they are not&#13;
readily quantifiable - particularly in economic terms. Under this "First Stage" of development some&#13;
partially treated sewage from two drainage areas will be discharged into the Arabian Sea at a distance&#13;
of three kilometers from the shore line. Sewage from two other drainage areas will receive the&#13;
equivalent of primary treatment before being discharged to tidal creeks.&#13;
6.02   Although not ideal, this level of sewage treatment and disposal will be a significant&#13;
improvement over the present situation in which sewage is discharged to the shoreline and to surface&#13;
water drains and channels within the heavily populated urban area. Furthermore, under the project a&#13;
time based program will be established leading to a Second Stage Program of sewage treatment and&#13;
disposal facilities in order to upgrade the quality of receiving waters to higher standards.&#13;
6.03   The provision of sewage treatment and disposal facilities under this Project will enable the&#13;
very extensive collection and conveyance systems, which have been constructed under the Second and&#13;
Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Projects, to be effectively utilized.&#13;
6.04   The slum sanitation component will alleviate the harsh living conditions of some one million&#13;
slum dwellers, mainly those occupying municipally-owned lands, by providing improved sanitation&#13;
facilities - mainly for safe excreta disposal. The implementation of this component will involve&#13;
beneficiary consultation as to the details of the facilities to be provided and participation in the&#13;
physical implementation and subsequent operations.&#13;
6.05   The direct physical benefits of the Project will come from removing domestic sewage and&#13;
industrial wastes from the inner city's natural water courses, surface water drains, shore line and&#13;
beaches thus improving the living conditions of the urban population living in close proximity to the&#13;
many "open sewers' which at present exist. This will reduce health risks as well as improve the&#13;
city's visual and aesthetic environment.&#13;
Rate of Return&#13;
6.06   No attempt has been made to estimate an economic rate of return for the Project. The&#13;
impacts on public health and the environment, which will result from the proposed improvements,&#13;
cannot readily be quantified in economic terms.&#13;
Least Cost Solution&#13;
6.07   In 1970, Messrs. Binnie and Partners Ltd., (UK), Consulting Engineers studied and reported&#13;
on the development of the sewerage system for Bombay in conjunction with a water supply study&#13;
which was implemented at the same time. The recommendations contained in this report were&#13;
supplemented by a subsequent sewage disposal plan, prepared by the same engineers. Although this&#13;
plan was not implemented as presented, it formed the basis for a further study and report by Messrs.&#13;
Metcalf and Eddy Inc. (USA), in association with Engineering Consultants (India), which is the&#13;
conceptual foundation for the proposed project. The works recommended in Metcalf &amp; Eddy report,&#13;
for the treatment and disposal of sewage, represent least cost solutions based on the comparison of&#13;
alternatives by present worth. Although these recommendations were prepared some fifteen years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
ago, they remain valid in terms of delineating catchment areas and selecting and locating the major&#13;
components of the system. These original recommendations, their staged development and variations&#13;
from the initial recommendations are described in Annex 2.&#13;
6.08   To ensure that the Second Stage Program (which will be prepared under the proposed project)&#13;
represents optimal choices, the alternatives of extending the aerated lagoons at Ghatkopar, Bhandup&#13;
and Versova, selecting sewage treatment and disposal alternatives for the Malad service area,&#13;
increasing the length of the Worli and Bandra outfalls and/or providing higher levels of treatment will&#13;
all be studied under the technical assistance component of this project (paras 3.15 and Annex 5).&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
6.09   The environmental assessment (EA) for the project was undertaken by National Environmental&#13;
Engineering Research Institute (NEERI); it began in 1991 and was initially designed to meet the&#13;
requirements of GOI Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 and World Bank OD 4.00 Annex A,&#13;
Environmental Assessment. The EA procedures were modified during the course of the studies to&#13;
conform to OD 4.01 when it superseded OD 4.00 Annex A, and OD 17.50 Disclosure of Operational&#13;
Information.&#13;
6.10   The primary objectives of the EA were: (a) to ascertain if the facilities proposed for the First&#13;
Stage Program would be adequate to provide the desired environmental benefits; (b) if inadequacies&#13;
were identified, to examine alternatives that would achieve the desired benefits; and (c) to develop a&#13;
Mitigation Plan to address potential adverse impacts of construction and operation. Because of the&#13;
extensive field investigations and hydrologic and water quality modelling required, the EA work was&#13;
undertaken in three segments -- marine outfalls, aerated lagoons at Malad and Versova, and aerated&#13;
lagoons at Bhandup and Ghatkopar -- and the results were compiled in separate reports. EA findings&#13;
and Mitigation and Monitoring Plans are summarized in Annex 11.&#13;
6.11   For the marine outfalls, the EA concludes that the most prominent environmental impact will&#13;
be a considerable improvement in physicochemical quality of coastal waters, including elimination of&#13;
the dissolved oxygen depletion that presently occurs during low tide near the coast at Mahim. This&#13;
will improve the ecological health of near-shore waters in the region and contribute toward&#13;
elimination of nuisance odors, amelioration of aesthetic conditions at recreational beaches, and&#13;
enhancement of beneficial water uses. No significant impairment of marine water quality or marine&#13;
biota is predicted in the vicinity of the outfall discharge, and positive impacts on fisheries are possible&#13;
in the coastal region. While the pipeline option also considered for the outfalls would have caused&#13;
some seabed disturbance and local water quality impacts during construction, the tunnel option will&#13;
not. Those construction-related impacts that could be significant, including vibration from blasting,&#13;
noise from equipment operation and materials hauling , and pollution from spoil disposal, can be&#13;
effectively mitigated. In contrast, under the "no action" alternative further deterioration of conditions&#13;
at beaches and of already poor coastal water quality is unavoidable. At negotiations. agreement was&#13;
reached that MCGB will implement the mitigation and monitoring plans recommended in the&#13;
environmental assessments for the Worli and Bandra outfalls and the lagoons.&#13;
6.12   The EA predicts that the 3-km outfalls will not result in consistent compliance with the&#13;
bacterial standard (&lt; 1,000 total coliform per 100 ml at 1 km from the shoreline at all times) set by&#13;
Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The EA pointed out the need for a more sophisticated and&#13;
extensive mathematical model to complete an analysis of conditions with longer outfalls, and&#13;
necessary data collection and model development has begun under the Bombay Coastal Water Quality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
Study (see para 3.17 and Annex 2). Also stated in the EA, however, is the fact that the GoI bacterial&#13;
standard is unnecessarily stringent when compared to EEC and US standards.&#13;
6.13   Application of the EEC standard, for example, could reduce the length of outfall ultimately&#13;
required to maintain bathing water quality at internationally-accepted levels. In recognition of these&#13;
circumstances, the MPCB "consent to discharge" and the GoI environmental clearance for the outfalls&#13;
approve their construction to 3-km in this project. However, the need for revised standards which&#13;
would apply to the Second Stage Program has been acknowledged. The designs for the 3-km outfalls&#13;
conveniently permit their eventual extension. As a condition for Loan negotiations, GoM reguested&#13;
the Ministry of Environment and Forests. Gol, to review water quality standards that are applicable to&#13;
the discharge of wastewater to marine coastal waters, with a view to establishing revised standards.&#13;
In addition, in order that the revised standards are available as basis for the Second Stage Program, at&#13;
negotiations. GoI agreement was reached at negotiations that. by June 1997. the revised water quality&#13;
standards, applicable to the discharge of wastewater to marine coastal waters, will be established.&#13;
6.14   On the basis of a mathematical water quality model NEERI developed for Malad Creek, the&#13;
EA concluded that while the planned aerated lagoon at Malad would reduce pollution loading and&#13;
would comply with the effluent standards in the MPCB consent to discharge, it would not materially&#13;
improve water quality in the upper reaches of the creek. A range of alternatives was therefore&#13;
evaluated, including advanced secondary treatment, but the model showed that due to the limited&#13;
freshwater flow and incomplete tidal flushing, none of them would change conditions in the creek to&#13;
the extent that it could support even a limited fish population. On the other hand, Versova is nearer&#13;
the mouth of Malad Creek, where tidal flushing is more thorough. The model shows that an aerated&#13;
lagoon at Versova will provide more significant water quality improvement, but not for the full&#13;
amount of wastewater projected for its service area.&#13;
6.15   MCGB therefore plans to complete the treatment works currently under construction at&#13;
Versova, with the present funding from Bombay Urban Development Project and Third Bombay&#13;
Water Supply and Sewerage Project. MCGB has eliminated the Malad lagoon altogether, since it is&#13;
not significantly superior to the "no action" alternative. Instead, MCGB has expanded the Bombay&#13;
Coastal Water OualitY Study (para 3.17) to include consideration of alternatives for wastewater&#13;
management up to the year 2015 in both the Malad and Versova service areas.&#13;
6.16   Mathematical model results included in the EA for the proposed aerated lagoons at Bhandup&#13;
and Ghatkopar show a more favorable situation because Thane Creek, the receiving water body, is&#13;
larger, more completely flushed during the tidal cycle, and not already as badly degraded as Malad&#13;
Creek. The construction of single-cell lagoons at these locations as planned in this project will arrest&#13;
the further deterioration in creek water quality projected under the "no action" alternative. An&#13;
analysis of alternatives for the Second Stage Program showed that the one currently proposed,&#13;
expansion to three-cell lagoons, will provide a level of pollution control sufficient to sustain viable&#13;
aquatic plant and animal communities in the creek until wastewater flows exceed the levels projected&#13;
for 2005. The EA recommends that flows beyond the 2005 volume be treated and discharged at&#13;
another location, because the model shows that while Thane Creek as a whole can accommodate&#13;
additional organic pollutant loading, there will be insufficient additional assimilative capacity at&#13;
Bhandup and Ghatkopar. The results of these actions, in terms of water quality improvement, will&#13;
not be fully realized, however, unless other communities that discharge wastewater to Thane Creek&#13;
construct comparable treatment works. They are communities outside the jurisdiction of MCGB, and&#13;
the EA therefore recommends that GOM develop and implement a comprehensive water quality&#13;
management plan for Thane Creek.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
6.17   The lagoon sites are in sparsely populated areas, so that impacts of operation on the&#13;
surrounding communities -- noise and odor, for instance -- will not be significant. The normal&#13;
construction-related impacts of the proposed lagoons, such as noise and dust, can be mitigated&#13;
effectively. However, the construction of the two lagoons will entail the unavoidable loss of&#13;
approximately 40 ha of mangrove, roughly 5 % of the total mangrove cover of the inner Thane Creek.&#13;
On the basis of EA recommendations, MoEF in its environmental clearance for the construction of&#13;
these lagoons, requires MCGB to carry out "compensatory mangrove planting for double the area&#13;
of mangroves disturbed shall be taken up and implemented immediately. Planning activities&#13;
should be initiated immediately for planting at least 200 ha of mangroves. All the remaining&#13;
mangrove areas on both sides of Thane Creek and its inlets should be protected and declared as&#13;
CRZ-I at least up to the liniit of 50m on the landward side from the edge of the mangroves."&#13;
6.18   Public information and consultation began in the early stages of the outfall EA with surveys of&#13;
the most directly affected groups -- beach users and fishing communities. After the EA findings&#13;
became known, and in connection with the GOI environmental clearance process, MCGB and its&#13;
design and EA consultants conducted meetings with the Corporators (the representatives of MCGB&#13;
political subdivisions) and with a group of environmental and community-based NGOs. MCGB also&#13;
prepared an information brochure on the outfalls in English and Marathi, advertised its availability in&#13;
newspapers, and distributed it to interested persons through the ward offices. The brochure has&#13;
elicited a large volume of written comments, nearly all favorable. A similar brochure is to be&#13;
published on the Bhandup and Ghatkopar Lagoons. MCGB staff and consultants have begun a&#13;
program of public meetings in affected communities, the first of which was held in Bandra. MCGB&#13;
has also contracted with a local university to conduct more detailed consultation with fishing&#13;
communities. The EAs for the outfalls and lagoons have been made locally available to the public.&#13;
6.19   MCGB's wish to include Slum Sanitation schemes in the project [para 3.08(e)], to be&#13;
implemented with assistance from NGOs and specialized consultants, was a direct outcome of the&#13;
consultation with the Corporators and local NGOs. At the meeting with NGOs, MCGB also agreed&#13;
to form a watchdog committee of citizens to provide oversight and advice during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Resettlement and Rehabilitation&#13;
6.20   The EA found that there are no resettlement or rehabilitation requirements for the sewerage&#13;
works proposed under the Project. In the Slum Sanitation Schemes, implementation will proceed in&#13;
those slums where it is determined that no involuntary resettlement is required for implementation&#13;
(see Policy Guidelines for Implementation in Annex 14).&#13;
Proiect Risks&#13;
6.21   The limited capabilities of MCGB engineers to undertake large and specialized sewerage&#13;
works of this nature increases the project risks. However, these risks would be mitigated by support&#13;
from experienced consultants (paras 3.10 and 3.25). The aerated lagoons largely involve the&#13;
placement and compaction of selected materials to form water retaining embankments and the&#13;
construction of sand drains. These works require careful site supervision to attain the required levels&#13;
of quality and a high level of on-site management to avoid delays.&#13;
6.22   The ocean outfalls present higher risks. Tunneling under the sea bed has fewer risks than&#13;
constructing a pipeline on the surface of the sea bed, which is subject to weather and sea conditions.&#13;
However, tunnel-boring carries the risk of unforeseen water inflows although boring techniques have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
been developed to minimize the risk and effect of such water inflows. Moreover, the inherent&#13;
uncertainties with this kind of work, and the risk-sharing principles adopted in the contracts (for cost-&#13;
containment and efficiency reasons) for this work, do bring a risk of cost overruns.&#13;
6.23   Measures have been taken to contain the construction risks by ensuring that, prior to&#13;
appraisal: (a) suitable contractors are pre-qualified under stringent criteria; (b) engineering designs&#13;
are compatible with proven construction practices; (c) qualified consultants prepare the designs and&#13;
supervise construction, having been delegated acceptable levels of responsibility; and (d) designs have&#13;
been reviewed by qualified and experienced independent panels of experts, and their suggestions&#13;
reflected in the final designs.&#13;
6.24   To reduce the risk of cost over-runs, and any consequent delays in project implementation,&#13;
physical contingencies of 25 % have been allowed for all civil, mechanical and electrical works, based&#13;
on the rationale that for the Worli and Bandra marine outfalls and the facilities to control siltation in&#13;
the Ghatkopar influent tunnel, there are inherent uncertainties associated with tunnel construction. In&#13;
the case of the aerated lagoons at Ghatkopar and Bhandup there is uncertainty in the location of&#13;
borrow areas that would yield sufficient laterite for embankrment construction. In the case of Bandra&#13;
pumping station, the magnitude and complexity of work and the preliminary status of preparation&#13;
warrants a higher than average level of contingency.&#13;
6.25   Similarly, because of the programmatic nature of the slum sanitation component, and the&#13;
preliminary status of preparation of the pumping station structural improvements and the conveyance&#13;
system improvements, higher than average physical contingencies are justified. Physical&#13;
contingencies of 10% have been included for all technical assistance, studies, site investigations and&#13;
engineering required for the Second Stage Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
VII AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;

INDIA&#13;
BOMBAY SEWAGE DISPOSAL PROJECT&#13;
EXISTING WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FACILITIES&#13;
Water Supplv&#13;
1.    Bombay's first piped water system was constructed in the mid-19th century to serve&#13;
commercial and residential areas in the southern portion of Bombay island near the harbor and the&#13;
Fort. Subsequent rapid development of industry and commerce in a northerly direction was&#13;
accompanied by development of land reclaimed from the sea to form the Greater Bombay area (440&#13;
sq Iam).&#13;
2.    Vihar Lake was Bombay's first source of water and was brought into use in 1860 to provide a&#13;
24-hour supply for an 8-year period until water demands exceeded the yield of the source. The Tulsi&#13;
reservoir was then developed in 1879 and the Tansa reservoir in 1883, the first of the more distant&#13;
sources of water located on the mainland. In 1944, further shortages of water prompted the Vaitama&#13;
reservoir project which was completed in 1957. However, a further increase in water demand, which&#13;
resulted partly from the extension of the Corporation's boundaries in that year, led to the development&#13;
of the UDDer Vaitarna project and to the Ulhas river intake which were completed in 1965 and 1967&#13;
respectively.&#13;
3.    The construction of a darn across the Bhatsai River provided the next water increment for&#13;
Bombay, athounting to 1,365 Mld developed in three stages of 455 Mld. These three stages of&#13;
development provided water for the Bank-assisted First (FY73), Second (FY79) and Third (FY86)&#13;
Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Projects. The present total average yield of all of the water&#13;
sources for Bombay is about 2,475 Mld (544 MIGD) On completion of the Third Bombay Water&#13;
Supply and Sewerage Project (estimated to be in 1996) the yield will increase to about 2,930 Mid&#13;
(644 MIGD). Feasibility studies on additional water sources of water for Bombay are now in&#13;
progress.&#13;
4.    Despite continued efforts to develop water supply systems to keep pace with rapid urban&#13;
expansion in the Bombay urban area the supply still falls short of the current water demand. On&#13;
completion of the Third Project, an estimated deficit of about 20% to 25% will mean that the&#13;
undesirable practice of restricting the supply of water on an area by area basis, to a few hours a day,&#13;
would continue. Almost all (about 95%) of the water supplied to the urban area (est. 2,930 Mld in&#13;
the year 1996), in addition to infiltration water, is returned as wastewater (sewage) to the sewage&#13;
conveyance system for treatment and disposal.&#13;
Historv of the Sewerage System&#13;
5.    Sewerage facilities within the city of Bombay date back to the 1860's following the&#13;
inauguration of the Vihar lake as the first piped water system to serve Bombay. An outfall at W&#13;
to discharge sewage to the Arabian sea (above low water level) was completed in 1880. Sewerage&#13;
facilities in the City continued to expand, and by 1900 all wastewater was conveyed to Lovegrove&#13;
where it was pumped to the sea through the Worli outfall. By 1905 the basis of the present sewage&#13;
collection, treatment and disposal system within the City had been established. Subsequent demands&#13;
were met by the duplication of sewers, provision of overflows to relieve surcharging in developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
areas, the construction of additional facilities at Lovegrove, and the construction of new treatment&#13;
facilities.&#13;
6.     By 1950, the rapid increase in population of the City rendered many of the sewerage&#13;
facilities completely inadequate. The Municipal Corporation boundary was extended in 1950 and&#13;
again in 1957 to its present location. Sewerage facilities within the suburbs and extended suburbs&#13;
were very limited during this period and, although some minor improvements were carried out, the&#13;
collection, treatment and disposal facilities continued to be completely inadequate to deal with the&#13;
increasing quantities of sewage.&#13;
7.     Various studies of the sewerage needs to serve Bombay were undertaken during the period to&#13;
1979 when a Master Plan Report was prepared by Metcalf and Eddy Inc. (USA), Consulting&#13;
Engineers, in association with Environmental Engineering Consultants (India). This report provides&#13;
the basis for the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage from the Greater Bombay Metropolitan&#13;
area to the year 2005. The First Stage of this Development Plan has been the basis for the Second&#13;
and Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Projects and is the basis for this proposed Bombay&#13;
Sewage Disposal Project (BSDP). This prior experience of the Bank has had some seriously&#13;
unsatisfactory aspects. "Lessons Learned and their Application" is in Annex 13.&#13;
The Sewerage Development Plan&#13;
8.    The objectives of the Development Plan were to: (a) provide sewage collection, treatment and&#13;
disposal facilities through the year 2005 that would achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of public&#13;
health and environmental quality at least cost; (b) provide for the maximum utilization of the self-&#13;
treatment capacities of the receiving waters and hence require the minimum investment in treatment&#13;
and disposal; (c) outline further environmental or related studies required for the development of a&#13;
long-range environmental quality improvement program.&#13;
Treatment and Disposal Facilities Under the Plan&#13;
9.     Under the Plan, the greater Bombay area is divided into seven drainage areas, each of which&#13;
has its own sewage treatment and disposal facilities; those to be provided under the First Stage of the&#13;
Plan, and the status of these works, are summarized on the next page.&#13;
10.   Additional sewage treatment facilities that were originally planned for the Malad drainage area&#13;
(No 5 on the next page) included preliminary treatment (for the removal of grit and screenings)&#13;
aerated lagoons and a 2.3 km force main to convey sewage from the pumping station to the aerated&#13;
lagoons. However, studies of the projected quality of the receiving waters in Malad creek, carried&#13;
out as part of the environmental assessment for the proposed BSDP (Annex 10), indicated that the&#13;
creek would have insufficient assimilative capacity to receive the Malad creek effluent. The provision&#13;
of treatment and disposal facilities for the Malad service area has, therefore, been deferred to the&#13;
Second Stage Program (Annex 4) and the replanning and design of these facilities is included in the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
The Conveyance System&#13;
11.   Parts of the sewage conveyance system have yet to be completed. Mostly, these comprise&#13;
short lengths of trunk sewers and interceptors which are scattered throughout the system. Their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

completion has been delayed by conflicting developments of road, rail and other services.&#13;
Completion of these links in the system is programmed for mid-1996.&#13;

The Remedial Works Program&#13;
12.   Some deficiencies in the facilities constructed under the Second Bombay Water Supply and&#13;
Sewerage Project became evident in 1988 and early 1989. In consequence, MCGB appointed&#13;
consultants to review these works under a comprehensive status survey and to reconmmend a program&#13;
of remedial measures; the requirements (but see para 16) were divided into four categories:&#13;
Category I:   Small works items to be implemented by the WSSD Sewerage Operations&#13;
Department.&#13;
Category II:  Works to be carried out by MCGB's WSSD Sewerage Projects Department,&#13;
with assistance of consultants where necessary, under ongoing contracts.&#13;
Category III: Works to be carried out by MCGB's WSSD Sewerage Projects Department,&#13;
with assistance of consultants where necessary, by awarding new contracts.&#13;
Category IV: Works for which further study, investigation and design are needed.&#13;
13.   Progress continues to be made in implementing this program. Of the total of 347 items in&#13;
categories I, II and III, 325 had been completed by the end of April, 1995. In summary:&#13;

INDIA&#13;
BOMBAY SEWAGE DISPOSAL PROJECT&#13;
SEWAGE TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL - THE MASTER PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
1.    Sewage treatment and disposal facilities to be constructed under this BSDP will complete the&#13;
system proposed in the original Master Plan (Methods for Treatment and Disposal of Wastewaters&#13;
from Greater Bombay; Metcalf and Eddy Inc., Consulting Engineers in association with&#13;
Environmental Engineering Consultants, May 1979). This Master plan developed a number of&#13;
alternatives that were feasible from the engineering point of view and then examined their advantages,&#13;
disadvantages and present value (discounted capital and annual costs) in order to select the most&#13;
beneficial method of sewage treatment and disposal. The following description is by "drainage area"&#13;
as given in Annex 1 page 3. The environmental aspects are reviewed in Annex I. The "Lessons&#13;
Learned and their Application" are given in Annex 13.&#13;
2.    The Colaba Drainage Area No 1 This area was originally referred to as Malabar, although&#13;
the Malabar area formed only part of Colaba drainage area. The original proposal was to provide&#13;
primary treatment and chlorination and then to discharge the effluent through an outfall to Bombay&#13;
harbor. The first stage of this proposal has been constructed and is now in operation. This&#13;
comprises the Colaba pumping station, preliminary treatment facilities for the removal of grit and&#13;
screenings (which is normally the first process in a primary treatment plant) and a 1 km long outfall.&#13;
No additional facilities for the Colaba drainage area are planned under the proposed project. There&#13;
were no adverse environmental indications in the recent environmental assessment. The Colaba&#13;
drainage area is now fully developed and additional flows in the future are not forecast.&#13;
3.    The disinfection of sewage effluent by heavy chlorination, as originally proposed, is no longer&#13;
considered to be appropriate for health and ecological reasons and because of the hazards associated&#13;
with the transportation, storage and handling of chlorine (a highly toxic gas) in a densely developed&#13;
urban area. For the quality of effluent is to be upgraded in the future to meet national or state&#13;
standards, the means by which this may be best achieved will require further study. Such study&#13;
would have to consider, inter alia, whether the original concept of providing primary treatment&#13;
continues to be appropriate having regard to: (i) its estimated level of enhancement of the level of&#13;
receiving water quality; (ii) the problem of disposal of primary sludge in an urban area (which may&#13;
have an adverse environmental impact); (iii) the difficulties of securing land to accommodate a&#13;
primary, or other, treatment facility; and (iv) the environmental impact of such a facility in a densely&#13;
developed urban area.&#13;
4.    The Worli and Bandra Drainage Areas No 2 and 3. These areas have sometimes been&#13;
referred to as Lovegrove and Mahim. The original plan was, as in the case of Colaba, to provide&#13;
primary treatment, chlorination and discharge to the Arabian Sea through one outfall at Worli and one&#13;
at Bandra. Originally the outfalls were proposed to be 3 km long, on the basis of the oceanographic&#13;
studies which formed part of the Master Plan Study. Later, it was decided to construct a first stage&#13;
of 1 km long outfalls (extendable to 3 kin) but this proved to be uneconomic as the cost of&#13;
mobilization for construction was disproportionate to such a short length of outfall. (This reasoning&#13;
did not apply to Colaba where the outfall diameter is much smaller thus allowing a simpler&#13;
construction method.) The lengths of the proposed outfalls therefore reverted to 3 km as included in&#13;
this BSDP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
5.    Also, as in the case of Colaba, the preliminary treatment (grit and screenings removal) has&#13;
been constructed at Worli (or Lovegrove) and such facilities are now proposed at Bandra.&#13;
Chlorination and primary treatment have been deferred for the same reasons as those outlined for the&#13;
Colaba area (para 3 above). However, unlike Colaba, provision has been made in the proposed&#13;
project to study: (i) future sewage flow projections from both drainage areas; (ii) alternatives for&#13;
treatment and disposal of these increased flows; and (iii) the relative benefits and costs and&#13;
environmental effects of enhancing sewage treatment and/or extending the outfalls. Provision has also&#13;
been made for engineering design of the recommended facilities for construction in the Second Stage&#13;
Program which is described in Annex 5.&#13;
6.    Versova and Malad Drainage Areas No 4 and 5. These areas may have previously been&#13;
referred to as the Marve zone. The Master Plan's recommended least cost methods of treatment and&#13;
disposal of sewage from these areas was preliminary treatment, biological treatment to secondary&#13;
effluent standard, chlorination and disposal to Malad creek.&#13;
7.     These facilities were subsequently divided into stages for the sake of reducing both the large&#13;
initial investment and related operation and maintenance costs but also to provide an opportunity to&#13;
gain experience in the operation of aerated lagoons, which were the selected least cost treatment&#13;
system. Chlorination was to be omitted for reasons stated above (para 3). The first stage of the&#13;
Versova aerated lagoons is now nearing completion at Versova, together with preliminary treatment&#13;
facilities. This first stage is designed to provide an effluent of 50 mg/l biochemical oxygen demand&#13;
(BOD) and 50 mg/l of suspended solids (SS). This can be compared with a probable 30/30 level of&#13;
BOD/SS for effluent from a secondary treatment facility.&#13;
8.     Notwithstanding the recommendations of the Master Plan Study, there was some apprehension&#13;
regarding the capacity of Malad creek to receive the discharge from the relatively large quantities of&#13;
effluent from the Versova and Malad drainage areas. This issue was, therefore, studied in detail&#13;
during the environmental assessment (EA) for this BSDP.&#13;
9.    In the study, which was conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research&#13;
Institute (NEERI), a mathematical model using the projected flow conditions for the years 2005 and&#13;
2015 showed that operating the lagoons to comply with the 100 mg/l BOD effluent limit, as given in&#13;
the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) consent, would not result in sustained dissolved&#13;
oxygen (DO) concentrations of more than 2.0 mg/l in the creek waters. Furthermore, the final results&#13;
showed that even the best possible secondary treatment of the 2005 flows at Malad (effluent BOD of&#13;
15 mg/l) would not lead to a sustained DO of more than 2.0 mg/l. When 2015 projections are&#13;
examined the situation is even worse. Since a DO of 2.0 mg/l is considered the minimum that would&#13;
enable a stable marine biotic community to be restored. This finding means that sewage treatment by&#13;
aerated lagoons, or at an even higher level by activated sludge treatment, would produce only&#13;
chemical and aesthetic benefits. There would be little or no measurable improvement in the present&#13;
biological impoverishment of Malad Creek. The lack of complete tidal flushing and the low natural&#13;
flow combine to produce a condition in which Malad Creek simply does not have the capacity to&#13;
assimilate the projected flows from the Malad drainage area after any realistic level of treatment.&#13;
10.   However, if the flow from the Malad drainage area is diverted from Malad Creek altogether,&#13;
the water quality model indicates that DO of 2.0 mg/l can be consistently achieved provided that the&#13;
flows from the Versova drainage area are treated to produce an effluent of no more than 30 mg/l&#13;
BOD. With the forecast increase in flows in the Versova drainage area there may be difficulties in&#13;
the longer term (2015). At that time, with the greater volume of wastewater projected, a treated&#13;

effluent achievement of 20 mg/l BOD may be no longer adequate. The model indicated that even a&#13;
treated effluent achievement of 15 mg/l BOD (which may be possible with secondary treatment by an&#13;
activated sludge process) would not lead to sustained DO in the creek of 2.0 mg/l.&#13;
11.   After due consideration of these findings and NEERI's recommendations, MCGB decided&#13;
upon the following actions:&#13;
(a)   to not proceed with the construction of treatment facilities at Malad, except for&#13;
screening and grit removal;&#13;
(b)   to refine and verify the new flow projections;&#13;
(c)   to initiate studies to develop a new master plan for collection and treatment and,&#13;
where possible, reuse of the flows projected for the Malad drainage area and adjacent&#13;
areas where appropriate, including a cost-effective scheme for diverting, treating and&#13;
disposing the portion of the flows that can be conveyed to the grit and screening&#13;
facilities by the present collector system;&#13;
(d)   to complete the construction of two trains of aerated lagoons at Versova, and place&#13;
them in operation, to provide secondary treatment to flows up to their design capacity;&#13;
and&#13;
(e)   to undertake studies to identify a cost-effective method for diverting, treating and&#13;
disposing of that portion of the flows (projected under the new flow studies for 2015)&#13;
that will be conveyed to Versova via the existing collector system.&#13;
These actions are included in the proposals for the Second Stage Program (Annex 5).&#13;
12.   Ghatkopar and Bhandup Drainage Areas No 6 and 7. These areas may previously have&#13;
been referred to as Chembur. Under a similar program to that for the Versova and Malad areas, the&#13;
Master Plan's recommended least cost methods of treatment and disposal of sewage from Ghatkopar&#13;
and Bhandup drainage areas were preliminary treatment, biological treatment to secondary effluent&#13;
standard, chlorination and disposal to Thane creek.&#13;
13.   Implementation was subsequently planned in stages for the sake of reducing both the large&#13;
initial investment costs and the related operation and maintenance costs. The first stage included the&#13;
preliminary treatment, and biological treatment to primary effluent standard without chlorination for&#13;
reasons described in para 3 above.&#13;
14.   NEERI's studies of Thane Creek in connection with the environmental assessment for this&#13;
project indicate that, when ultimately expanded to three-stages, the proposed aerated lagoons will be&#13;
capable of treating the sewage flows projected for 2005 to a level consistent with maintaining a&#13;
reasonable and acceptable concentration of dissolved oxygen in Thane Creek. Such effluent&#13;
discharges, however, would fully utilize Thane Creek's assimilative capacity near the locations at&#13;
which the treated effluent would be discharged, requiring new discharge locations and/or additional&#13;
treatment when the flows exceed the projected 2005 flows. Additional water quality and assimilation&#13;
capacity studies, extended along Thane Creek to its confluence with the sea, and feasibility studies&#13;
will be necessary to examine appropriate means of treatment and disposal (proposed to be&#13;

areas after 2005.&#13;
15.    From the environmental assessment (see Annex 11), it is noted that the single cell lagoons, as&#13;
proposed for the first stage under this BSDP) will arrest the deterioration of water quality in Thane&#13;
Creek. The single cell lagoons could be augmented to the ultimate three-cells configuration within&#13;
four to five years as part of the second stage implementation.&#13;

PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Design&#13;
1.    The design of the Project has taken careful account of the lessons of previous experience,&#13;
which has had some gravely unsatisfactory aspects. Annex 13 "Lessons Learned and their&#13;
Application" gives the details and gives in full the Evaluation Summary of the Operation Evaluation&#13;
Department's Project Performance Audit Report No 9265, dated December 31, 1990.&#13;
Summary of Physical Components&#13;
2.    The maior physical comiponents of the project (in descending order of magnitude - see Map&#13;
IBRD No 26628 attached) are listed below. Their environmental aspects are reviewed in Annex 11.&#13;
(a)   the Worli and Bandra (two) ocean outfalls for the disposal of partially treated sewage&#13;
to the Arabian Sea;&#13;
(b)   the Bandra influent pumping station, to receive sewage flows from the Bandra tunnel,&#13;
serving the entire Bandra service area, and to discharge these flows, after screening&#13;
and grit removal, through an ocean outfall;&#13;
(c)   the Ghatkopar and Bhandup (two) Aerated Lagoons, to provide biological treatment&#13;
for sewage from these two service areas prior the discharge to Thane creek;&#13;
(d)    Conveyance System Remedial Works, to correct deficiencies in the sewage&#13;
conveyance system, identified by a status survey of the system to be implemented&#13;
under the project;&#13;
(e)    Slum Sanitation Schemes, to provide sanitation improvements (with a particular&#13;
emphasis on safe excreta disposal) to up to 1.0 million slum dwellers living in up to&#13;
164 selected individual slums located on municipally-owned lands 'I; (technical&#13;
assistance, under "Project Support" - para 28 below, will use a beneficiary&#13;
consultation approach as well as technical assessments to identify the form of&#13;
sanitation improvements to be provided); further details are in Annex 14;&#13;
(f)    facilities to overcome siltation in the Ghatkopar Influent Tunnel; the final choice&#13;
between: (i) an additional tunnel capable of satisfactorily conveying low sewage flows&#13;
to the Ghatkopar pumping station; and (ii) the provision of preliminary treatment to&#13;
all such flows, is the subject of ongoing study effort, but the costs of either alternative&#13;
are similar; and&#13;
'I/ These selected slums number 164 individual settlement clusters in 15 different city wards.&#13;
The largest has a population of 69,750, the smallest has a population of 416 and their average&#13;
population is 5,596.&#13;

existing pumping stations from hydrostatic uplift forces.&#13;
The Ocean Outfalls [para 2(a) above]&#13;
3.     As originally designed early in the 1980's, the Worli and Bandra outfalls were to be&#13;
constructed of 3.5 m diameter reinforced concrete pipes laid in a dredged seabed trench and protected&#13;
with rock armor. The outfalls were to be laid 3 km out to sea and were to discharge degritted and&#13;
screened sewage in 10 to 12 meters depth of water. In this first stage of development, discharges did&#13;
not meet widely-accepted environmental standards, and provision was made in the engineering&#13;
planning for the future addition of primary treatment.&#13;
4.     Construction of the outfalls began in 1984. A total length of 498m of outfall was laid in the&#13;
sea at Worli and 209m at Bandra. The contractor stopped work in 1987 contending that the outfalls&#13;
could not be constructed as designed. At this time, many outfall pipes had been cast but not laid and&#13;
extensive trench excavation had been undertaken. The ensuing dispute concerned the suitability of the&#13;
design for the alleged seabed conditions. In 1988 MCGB retained a consultant, Binnie and Partners&#13;
(India) Ltd. in association with Tata Consulting Engineers, to reinvestigate the seabed conditions, and&#13;
to investigate the costs, benefits and risks of altemative approaches to completing the outfalls and to&#13;
prepare detailed engineering designs.&#13;
5.     Site investigation work was completed in February 1990 and provided reliable and useful data&#13;
on the geological conditions along the outfall routes. Five alternative methods for constructing the&#13;
outfalls were considered, two of which were finally selected on the grounds of technical feasibility&#13;
and estimated costs. The two methods selected were: (a) reinforced concrete pipes laid in trench on&#13;
the seabed and protected by rock armor, similar in many respects to the outfalls originally proposed;&#13;
and (b) the construction of tunnels bored in rock beneath the sea bed from vertical shafts at the shore&#13;
line. Both alternatives incorporate tapered diffusors with risers to discharge sewage at the sea bed,&#13;
and provision for extension of the outfalls if required in the future. Both alternatives provide for&#13;
internal diameters of 3.5m and lengths of 3 km at both Worli and Bandra.&#13;
6.     Engineering designs, geological data and geotechnical data were reviewed by independent&#13;
experts comprising two individual specialists in geology and tunnel construction, and others from the&#13;
Sydney Water Board, which recently completed construction of three ocean outfalls of similar&#13;
dimensions in Sydney harbor. The experts' review recommendations were incorporated in the final&#13;
engineering designs and specifications, as appropriate.&#13;
7.     MCGB invited bids by international competitive bidding (ICB), for both alternatives, from&#13;
international and local contractors who were prequalified under stringent criteria. It was prescribed&#13;
that the selection of the construction method would be based on price. The lowest responsive bid was&#13;
for the submarine tunnel alternative for which a contract is to be signed before loan effectiveness.&#13;
Construction of the outfalls will be supervised by suitably-qualified and experienced independent&#13;
consulting engineers, acceptable to the Bank, and designated as "the engineer" in the construction&#13;
contracts [see related TA para 28(1) below].&#13;

Bandra Influent Pumping Station [para 2(b) abovel&#13;
8.     As originally designed, the pumping station was to receive sewage flows from the Bandra&#13;
tunnel, which was to operate as an inverted syphon, and deliver the flows to the 3 km long ocean&#13;
outfall at Bandra. The facility is one of the largest sewage pumping stations in the world, with a peak&#13;
discharge capacity of 22 cubic meters per second. The wet well capacity was, however, relatively&#13;
small with a detention time of only 9 seconds at the design peak flow. These, and other technical&#13;
factors, caused some concern regarding the operation and reliability of the facility. In 1991, MCGB&#13;
requested their consultants to examine the design and report on these issues. As a result, the pumping&#13;
station was redesigned.&#13;
9.     The main features of the new design are the lowering of the invert level of the wet well to&#13;
allow open channel flow in the tunnel (in place of the inverted syphon) and an increase in the capacity&#13;
of the wet well. The resulting hydraulic configuration enables the system to be operated within&#13;
reasonable reaction times to flow variations and wet well levels. As in the original design, flow from&#13;
the pumping station will pass through a 3m diameter steel main 1980m long to the fine screen and&#13;
grit removal plant and will then discharge by gravity through the Bandra outfall. If the flow exceeds&#13;
the capacity of this pumping station, due to a combination of the pumping rate and tide level, the&#13;
excess flow will pass over a weir into the effluent pumping station which houses low head, axial flow&#13;
pumps which also discharge through the outfall.&#13;
10.   Bids will be invited from prequalified contractors and construction will be supervised by&#13;
suitably-qualified and experienced independent consulting engineers, acceptable to the Bank, and&#13;
designated as "the engineer" in the construction contracts [see related TA para 28(1) and (8) below].&#13;
The Aerated Lagoons [para 2(c) abovel&#13;
11.    The Ghatkopar and Bhandup aerated lagoons have been planned to provide biological&#13;
treatment for sewage flows from these service areas to the year 2005. The effluent quality will be&#13;
100 mg/l for both BOD and suspended solids, which is acceptable. The effluent will be discharged to&#13;
Thane creek. Model studies have shown that the proposed initial treatment will arrest the&#13;
deterioration of the receiving water quality in Thane creek but that it will be necessary to augment the&#13;
treatment level by building additional lagoon capacity by the year 2005.&#13;
12.   The choice of aerated lagoons as a treatment method is particularly suitable for a developing&#13;
country application in view of the low degree of maintenance and relative ease of operation. This&#13;
system of biological treatment is relatively trouble free and will normally accommodate a wide range&#13;
of waste types and characteristic variations, provided that chemical wastes, normally associated with&#13;
industrial discharges, are maintained within acceptable limits. This system of treatment is cost-&#13;
effective provided, as in the case of Bombay, large areas of land at relatively low value are available&#13;
within reasonable distance of the urban area and provided that energy costs are within acceptable&#13;
levels.&#13;
13.    The construction of lagoons does not involve complex procedures and is well within the&#13;
capability of Indian contractors. However, close quality control of the placement of water-retaining&#13;
embankments is essential. A high standard of construction supervision is therefore necessary. With&#13;
the use of earth moving plant, construction periods are relatively short, probably less than two years.&#13;
However, a much longer construction period (four to five years) is common in India where manual&#13;
methods are employed. Bids will be invited by ICB procedures from prequalified contractors and&#13;

[see related TA para 28(1) below].&#13;
Sewage Conveyance System Remedial Works [para 2(d) abovel&#13;
14.    The Greater Bombay sewage conveyance system is extensive. Although most of it was&#13;
constructed in the last 20 years, the sewers in the older parts of the city date from the early part of&#13;
this century (see "History of the Sewerage System in Annex 1). Some of the older parts of the&#13;
system operate as a "combined system" (in which sanitary sewage and surface water flow in the same&#13;
network) but most of the system is designed as a "separate system" for sanitary wastewater flows&#13;
only. In summary:&#13;
Diameter (mm)                  Length (km)&#13;
less than 375 mm                          700&#13;
375 mm or greater                 200&#13;
TOTAL         900&#13;
15.    Records and maintenance of the system have been neglected. From the level of flows&#13;
reaching the pumping stations, and from surveys of the surface water drains and streams, it is clear&#13;
that groundwater infiltration and inflow levels are high. This indicates that significant quantities of&#13;
surface and ground water are reaching the sanitary sewers through damaged pipes, leaking joints,&#13;
defective manholes (often missing covers), and illegal, or in some cases legal, connections of surface&#13;
water drains to sewer manholes and/or directly to sewers.&#13;
16.    Conversely, it is clear that many surface water drains and streams contain sewage from&#13;
sources such as pavement dwellers and slum hutments, illegal and legal connections of properties to&#13;
surface water drains and unrecorded connections.&#13;
17.    Prior to the Project, a comprehensive list of 376 "remedial measures" items of work was&#13;
prepared and implementation commenced. The status of and program for these actions is in Annex 1&#13;
paras 12-16.&#13;
18.    Under the Project, surveys will be carried out to locate all sewers, manholes, overflow weirs&#13;
and other appurtenances and also to determine the physical status of these facilities (para 15). From&#13;
these surveys programs of conveyance system remedial works and preventative maintenance will be&#13;
prepared for implementation under this Component of the Project [see related TA in para 28(3)&#13;
below].&#13;
Slum Sanitation Schemes [para 2(e) above]&#13;
19.    MCGB estimates that there are 5.5 million slum dwellers in Bombay. There have been&#13;
previous efforts to improve sanitary conditions in Bombay's slums with the "Low-Cost Sanitation"&#13;
components included in the Bank-supported Second (FY79) and Third (FY85) Bombay Water Supply&#13;
and Sewerage Projects. However, these were largely unsuccessful, probably because of an inadequate&#13;
institutional commitment by MCGB and a failure to invoke beneficiary participation in the decision-&#13;
making.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
20.    However, during the public hearings which have been conducted in relation to the&#13;
environmental assessment of this BSD Project (Annex 11), NGOs and slum-dwellers have vigorously&#13;
represented to MCGB their concerns for the prevailing sanitary conditions in Bombay's slums.&#13;
MCGB's response has been to give assurances as to the prompt initiation of a program to improve&#13;
these conditions. Moreover, the Government of India's Ministry of Environment and Forests, in&#13;
granting its environmental clearance for this BSD project, has directed MCGB to prepare an&#13;
environmental sanitation program and implementation plan to benefit slum and pavement dwellers.&#13;
MCGB has now indicated its strong commitment to such a program and has sought Bank support for&#13;
the initiation of such a program under this BSDP. To move forward promptly, MCGB has already&#13;
engaged, entirely on its own initiative, an association between a long-established well-known Bombay-&#13;
based consulting engineering firm and a well-known NGO with relevant prior experience.&#13;
21.   In concept, MCGB proposes to initiate such a program in those 164 slums which presently&#13;
occupy municipally-owned lands, which contain an estimated one million people or nearly 20% of&#13;
Bombay's total slum population (para 19). This approach pernits the prompt initiation of such a&#13;
program without awaiting resolution of the legal issues arising from public investments on privately-&#13;
owned lands or, in the alternative, the costs and delays to be expected from efforts towards the&#13;
municipal acquisition of such lands. However, it is also the intent that this initial effort would&#13;
provide the experience base from which to refine the design of a program for the remaining slum&#13;
dwellers.&#13;
22.    At negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances on the details of the Program design including:&#13;
(a) the details of institutional arrangements and the related organization and staffing within MCGB;&#13;
(b) policy guidelines for implementation, with particular reference to any resettlement requirements;&#13;
(c) outline terms of reference for: (i) related promotion and publicity (ii) related consulting/NGO&#13;
services (including beneficiary consultation) endeavor [para 20 above and paras 28(4) and 33 below]&#13;
on a slum by slum basis; and (iii) independent monitoring and evaluation. Bank supervision missions&#13;
will undertake (with MCGB) annual reviews of the program, taking account - inter alia - of the&#13;
findings and recommendations of the independent monitoring and evaluation. In the preceding, due&#13;
account will be taken of relevant prior experience in Bombay, elsewhere in India and elsewhere in the&#13;
world, and the adequacy and prospective sustainability of arrangements for operation and maintenance&#13;
of investments under the Project. It is anticipated that investments will be concentrated in facilities&#13;
for the safe disposal of excreta but that other low-cost, technically feasible environrnental&#13;
improvement measures which may relate, for example, to improved solid wastes collection and/or to&#13;
improved surface water drainage would not be precluded. The implementation of this Program is&#13;
planned in two Stages: (i) a First Stage covering about 10% to 15% of the beneficiaries; and (ii) a&#13;
Second Stage, covering the remaining beneficiaries, which is designed taking full account of all the&#13;
lessons of experience of the First Stage. However, the process of annual reviews [(d) above] would&#13;
continue throughout. One aim of the social and physical surveys, the assessment of technical options&#13;
and beneficiary consultation process would be ensure that, in the implementation of the program,&#13;
implementation in a particular slum will proceed after it has been established that there are no&#13;
resettlement requirements.&#13;
Facilities to overcome siltation is the Ghatkopar Influent Tunnel [para 2(f) abovel&#13;
23.    As a result of concerns regarding possible difficulties in the future operation of the Ghatkopar&#13;
influent tunnel system, MCGB instructed its Consultants to review the original hydraulic design of the&#13;
tunnel. Accordingly, early in 1994, the Consultants, Binnie and Partners (India) Ltd, reported on&#13;
their study of the hydraulics of the tunnel. This report identified major sediment transport difficulties&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
resulting from the then recently-completed revised sewage flow estimates for the Ghatkopar drainage&#13;
area.&#13;
24.    Several alternative engineering solutions which would resolve the deficiencies of the system,&#13;
were then studied. The alternative of the construction of an additional tunnel (operating under open&#13;
channel flow conditions) was recommended as the least-cost feasible alternative, but the costs of the&#13;
alternative provision of preliminary treatment of these flows is similar; a final decision is pending.&#13;
This report also identified the defects in the existing tunnel and made recommendations for repairs.&#13;
The existing tunnel will be modified for use as a standby facility and for conveying excess flows.&#13;
Both the additional tunnel and the repairs to the existing tunnel are included in this BSDP [see related&#13;
TA in para 28(9) below]. Construction will be supervised by suitably-qualified and experienced&#13;
independent consulting engineers, acceptable to the Bank, and designated as "the engineer" in the&#13;
construction contracts [see related TA para 28(1) and (9) below].&#13;
Pumping Station Structural Stability [see para l(g) above]&#13;
25.    The engineering design of.structures located below ground normally incorporates measures to&#13;
balance the hydrostatic uplift forces to which the structure is subjected. Two common methods used&#13;
to balance these uplift forces are: (i) anchoring the structure to underlying rock by the use of steel&#13;
"rock anchors"; and (ii) ensuring that the weight of the structure is sufficient to balance, or exceed,&#13;
the uplift forces (by providing a thicker floor slab or increasing wall thicknesses etc).&#13;
26.    The use of rock anchors is sometimes preferred on the basis of initial cost. However, the&#13;
method requires very careful placement and bonding of the steel anchors and their adequate protection&#13;
from corrosion to ensure that they will sustain the unbalanced uplift forces throughout the life of the&#13;
structure.&#13;
27.    Because of the apparent risk of early failure of several rock anchors in sewage pumping&#13;
stations in Bombay MCGB, with the help of consultants, carried out a study of all of those stations in&#13;
which rock anchors had been used, and also reviewed the methods used for their initial installation.&#13;
These studies concluded that five pumping stations should be stabilized by the construction of&#13;
additional structural members. These five are the Versova, Malad, Bhandup, and Lovegrove (Worli)&#13;
influent and effluent pumping stations. These works will be designed and construction will be&#13;
supervised by consultants acceptable to the Bank and will be financed under the proposed project [see&#13;
related TA in para 28(1) and (10) below].&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
28.    The technical assistance for BSDP falls into one of three categories as follows:&#13;
Categorv 1: Project Sunport&#13;
(1)   supervision of construction of the Worli and Bandra submarine tunnel outfalls, the Bandra&#13;
pumping station, the Ghatkopar influent tunnel, the Ghatkopar and Bhandup lagoons and the&#13;
structural improvements to five pumping stations; (see paras 2-27 above and 29 below).&#13;
(2)   upgrading WSSD's operation and maintenance practices in the whole of the Bombay sewerage&#13;
system [see para 30-31 below];&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(6)   completing detailed engineering designs for sewage treatment and disposal facilities in six&#13;
drainage areas listed in (5) above [see para 34 below];&#13;
Category 3: Complementarv Studies (under separate financing)&#13;
(7)   a Bombay Coastal Water Quality Study (Japan grant - part in process)[ see paras 36-37&#13;
below];&#13;
(8)   Bandra Pumping Station Study [see paras 2(b) and 8-10 above and para 38 below -&#13;
completed];&#13;
(9)   Ghatkopar Influent Tunnel Study [see paras 2(f) and 23-24 above and para 38 below -&#13;
completed];&#13;
(10)   Pumping Station Structural Stability Study [see paras 2(g) and 25-27 above and 38 below -&#13;
completed].&#13;
Each of these items is briefly described in the following paragraphs.&#13;
Categorv 1: Project Support&#13;
29.   Supervision of Construction of the Worli and Bandra Outfalls, the Bandra Pumping&#13;
Station. and the Ghatkopar Iniluent Tunnel. An ongoing contract with international consultants&#13;
for part of the duration of construction of these facilities provides for construction supervision by&#13;
Consultants; this contract expires 30-Jun-96. As a condition of effectiveness and before 31-Jul-95.&#13;
MCGB has agreed to either extend this contract, in consultation with the Bank. to cover the&#13;
remainder of the construction period OR furnish to the Bank. in a form satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
consultant recruitment documentation for the invitation of alternative competitive proposals and a&#13;
program for such recruitment. Under the ongoing contract, its extension or the alternative proposals,&#13;
the consultant will be designated as the "engineer", as reflected in the general conditions of contract,&#13;
for the construction of the Worli and Bandra outfalls, and (ultimately) in the general conditions of&#13;
contract for the construction of the Bandra pumping station, and for the Ghatkopar Influent Tunnel.&#13;
Consultants will also supervise the construction of the Ghatkopar and Bhandup lagoons, and the&#13;
pumping station structural modifications but may not be designated as the "engineer" for this work,&#13;
unless such an arrangement is requested by MCGB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

30.   Upgrading WSSD Operation and Maintenance Practices. The level of maintenance of the&#13;
existing sewerage system has been consistently poor, lacking adequately trained and skilled staff,&#13;
suitable facilities and appropriate plant and equipment. In addition, preventive maintenance&#13;
procedures are inadequate and the organizational structure of that section of WSSD dealing with&#13;
sewerage maintenance needs reform.&#13;
31.   MCGB has agreed to address this issue with the assistance of suitably qualified consultants,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, to implement a comprehensive study and to introduce improved operation and&#13;
maintenance practices and organizational reforms. The consultant recruitment documentation for this&#13;
study are available in the project file (Annex 15) and the award of this consulting services contract&#13;
was made a condition for negotiations.&#13;
32.   Topographic and Condition Surveys of the Conveyance System. These surveys would be&#13;
implemented in connection with the component for the Conveyance System Remedial Works&#13;
described in paragraphs 14 to 18 above. The topographic survey would enable record plans of the&#13;
conveyance system to be prepared and would be followed by a condition survey of the system to&#13;
provide input for the preparation of a program for remedial works. Requests for proposal for these&#13;
surveys are available in the project file (Annex 15) and the award of this consulting services contract&#13;
was also a condition for negotiations.&#13;
33.    The Slum Sanitation Technical Assistance relates to the physical component described in&#13;
para 3.08(e); the program and some further details of this technical assistance are described in&#13;
Annex 3 paras 19-22. An understanding, in the form of agreed outline terms of reference, was&#13;
reached at negotiations for this TA which comprise:&#13;
(1)   program publicity;&#13;
(2)   on a slum by slum basis - social surveys; physical surveys and the assessment of physically&#13;
feasible and economical technical options; beneficiary consultations for the purposes of the&#13;
determination of community preferences, of beneficiary contributions to investments and to&#13;
subsequent operation and maintenance, and the determination, for implementation, that no&#13;
resettlement is required (see para 22) and reporting on all of the preceding; and&#13;
(3   independent monitoring and evaluation of both the procedures and the activities described in&#13;
(2) above and reporting thereon.&#13;
Further details of the policy guidelines and the implementation modality for slum sanitation schemes,&#13;
and outline terms of reference as described above are in Annex 14.&#13;
Categorv 2: Studies. Site Investigations and EnMineering for Second Stage Works&#13;
34.   The Environmental Impact Assessment (Annex 11) that has been carried out for the first stage&#13;
of development of sewage treatment and disposal facilities to serve the Greater Bombay area,&#13;
confirms that higher levels of treatment and/or improved disposal methods will be required to meet&#13;
future coastal water quality standards. Planning for these improvements in sewage treatment and&#13;
disposal facilities has, therefore, been included in the proposed project in the form of: (i) the Bombay&#13;
Coastal Water Quality Study (para 36) which is under implementation; and (ii) the Second Stage&#13;
Program, which includes provision for feasibility studies, and engineering designs for sewage&#13;
treatment and disposal facilities in six service areas. The agreed schedule for implementation of the&#13;

Second Stage Program and a description of the scope of each of the studies in the Program are&#13;
detailed in Annex 5.&#13;
Category 3: Complementary Studies&#13;
35.   These studies have been, or are being implemented under separate financing in the preparation&#13;
of components of the proposed project and of the program of Second Stage works.&#13;
36.   The Bombay Coastal Water Ouality Study. This study is financed under a Japanese grant&#13;
and is being implemented by India's National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)&#13;
under the direction of MCGB. The study supplements the hydrographic work carried out as part of&#13;
the 1979 Master Plan and extends the work under a recent study implemented by NEERI, as part of&#13;
the Environmental Impact Assessment. The study will estimate receiving water quality that would&#13;
result from various lengths of outfalls discharging to the Arabian Sea, and/or sewage treatment&#13;
options, for Worli and Bandra service areas, in addition to the effects of various outfall locations for&#13;
Malad and Versova service areas. The extended study will examine the quality of receiving waters&#13;
along the coastline (to about 8 to 10 km from the shore line) from a point about 20 km north of&#13;
Malad creek to a point about 7 km south of the Worli outfall. A further study will extend the water&#13;
quality studies of Thane creek almost to a point at which the creek reaches the sea (adjacent to&#13;
Bombay harbor).&#13;
37.   The results of the study will enable MCGB to assess the improvement in coastal waters which&#13;
would result from various methods of sewage treatment and disposal, and the effects of extending the&#13;
outfalls to various distances from the shore line under the Second Stage Program, in order to satisfy&#13;
future environmental standards. Results of the study would provide the "starting point" and primary&#13;
input for engineering feasibility studies for sewage treatment and disposal facilities to be constructed&#13;
in the Second Stage Pro gram to serve the six drainage areas (Annex 4).&#13;
38.   The remaining three complementary studies that have been implemented to resolve issues&#13;
arising from deficiencies in some of the existing facilities as outlined above. These three studies&#13;
address the following items: Bandra Pumping Station (paras 8-10); Ghatkopar Influent Tunnel (paras&#13;
23-24): and Pumping Station Structural Stability (paras 25-27). Reports on these studies are available&#13;
in the Project File (Annex 15).&#13;

The Need for the Second Stage Program&#13;
2.     Environmental impact studies conducted during preparation of the proposed project reveal&#13;
that, even after completion of the works presently planned (under the First Stage Program), the&#13;
quality of coastal waters and the water quality in Malad and Thane creeks will require further&#13;
measures for their protection in order to comply with national standards in effect elsewhere, which&#13;
are indicative of the level of standards that India's State and Central Government may require in the&#13;
future. It will, therefore, be necessary to raise the quality of sewage effluent, or to change the&#13;
locations at which sewage effluent is discharged, or even to take both measures, in order to satisfy&#13;
future environmental requirements. Planning for these Second Stage improvements in the sewage&#13;
treatment and disposal facilities is included in the proposed project, as outlined in the above table, and&#13;
further described in the following paragraphs by drainage area.&#13;
The Colaba Drainage Area&#13;
3.     The existing facilities appear to have sufficient capacity to deal with flows from the Colaba&#13;
drainage area up to the year 2015; the need for further works will be assessed in the Stage 2 studies.&#13;
Program.&#13;
The Worli and Bandra Drainage Areas&#13;
Population Growth&#13;
4.     The 1991 census shows that the populations in both drainage areas are significantly different&#13;
from those predicted in the 1979 Master Plan Report (para. 2.10). In Worli there has been a&#13;
migration out of the area due partly to a shift in industry and flows to the Worli outfall are, therefore,&#13;
less than had been forecast. In the Bandra drainage area, the population has grown more rapidly than&#13;
forecast, due partly to migration from the rural areas, and a trend to make land, that was formerly&#13;
used for industry, available for housing development. In accordance with a recently formulated&#13;
MCGB policy, part of this land is designated for re-housing squatters. These factors, and the increase&#13;
in flows due to rising living standards justify continuing a program to measure sewage flows in most&#13;
of the drainage areas. By this means, up to date information would be available for planning the&#13;
Second Stage and particularly for the feasibility studies.&#13;
Details of the Second Stage Program&#13;
5.     Flow studies carried out in 1992 will be updated in the light of MCGB plans to improve water&#13;
supplies to these areas. Other factors to be considered are the planned developmental and&#13;
demographic changes within the limitations imposed by the general infrastructure of the areas. The&#13;
flow studies will be implemented by a dedicated team, to be established in MCGB, and will begin in&#13;
1995. The initial study results will be available in 1997 for incorporation into the proposed&#13;
engineering feasibility studies.&#13;
6.     Bombay Coastal Water Ouality Studies (BCWOS). Studies that were implemented as part of&#13;
the Environmental Assessment in relation to the Worli and Bandra outfalls, focussed on an area&#13;
contiguous to the outfalls and was limited to a distance of 3 or 4 km from the shoreline. The area to&#13;
be studied under BCWQS as part of the Second Stage Program will refine the available hydrodynamic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

data and will cover a much larger area (extending to about 8 to 10 km from the shore line and from a&#13;
point about 20 km north of Malad creek to an point about 7 km south of Worli outfall).&#13;
7.    A mathematical model, to be constructed as part of the study, will provide data on the quality&#13;
of coastal waters that could be achieved by the provision of varying methods of sewage treatment and&#13;
effluent disposal through outfalls of varying lengths. The study, which is grant funded and is being&#13;
conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute under the direction of&#13;
MCGB, began in November 1994 and is scheduled to provide information to MCGB in the form of a&#13;
draft report by September 1996.&#13;
8.    The Feasibility Study. Under the agreed schedule, proposals for the study will be invited&#13;
from consultants in June 1996 and consultants will be appointed in April 1997. The feasibility study&#13;
can only begin when flow studies have been completed and information is available from BCWQS.&#13;
The feasibility study is scheduled for completion in December 1999.&#13;
9.    The scope of work for the feasibility study will include:&#13;
(a)  review of flow forecasts to the year 2020;&#13;
(b)  review of the BCWQS information;&#13;
(c)  procurement of contracts for site investigation;&#13;
(d)  examination of alternative methods for extending the (then existing) Worli and Bandra&#13;
outfalls;&#13;
(e)  examination of sewage treatment options;&#13;
(f)  assessment of the required lengths of outfalls;&#13;
(g)  assessment of land requirements and availability;&#13;
(h)  estimates of costs and environmental benefits of different options;&#13;
(i)  estimates of capital costs and operation and maintenance costs;&#13;
(j)  supervision of site investigations;&#13;
(k)  recommendations for the Second Stage of sewage treatment and disposal development;&#13;
(1)  preparation of an implementation program and a schedule of financing requirements; and&#13;
(m)  recommendations for staffing and training.&#13;
10.   Detailed Engineering Designs. On completion of the feasibility studies, proposals will be&#13;
invited from consultants for the preparation of detailed engineering designs and procurement&#13;
documents for works recommended in the feasibility studies. The schedule would follow the outline&#13;
above (items 10, 11 and 12). Construction contracts for the Second Stage Program for the Worli and&#13;
Bandra drainage areas would be awarded in June 2003, and works would be completed in the year&#13;
2007.&#13;
The Versova and Malad Drainage Areas&#13;
Factors Influencing the Second Stage Proramn&#13;
11.   Recently completed environmental impact studies indicate that discharges of sewage effluent to&#13;
Malad creek from the combined Versova and Malad drainage areas would seriously deplete dissolved&#13;
oxygen levels of the receiving waters. In addition, preliminary population and flow studies conducted&#13;
in 1994 show residential development in these areas to be more rapid than was forecast in the original&#13;
Master Plan. Thus, the original plan in which treated sewage effluent from these two drainage areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

would be discharged to Malad creek is no longer appropriate if the ecosystem of the creek is to be&#13;
restored.&#13;
12.   The discharge of sewage effluent to Malad creek from one drainage area, Versova, is,&#13;
however, sustainable in the medium term (possibly for about 15 years). The Versova aerated lagoons&#13;
will be put into operation on completion in 1996 and may be incorporated into an enhanced treatment&#13;
and disposal system that will ultimately begin to serve the Malad and Versova areas in the year 2009.&#13;
Details of the Second Sta2e Program&#13;
13.   Capacity of the Existing System. Surveys of the entire Bombay sewage conveyance system&#13;
will be carried out under the First Stage of the proposed project. These surveys will provide&#13;
information (e.g.,pipe sizes, topography, type of construction, and condition) from which the&#13;
capacities of components of the existing conveyance system may be estimated. The surveys will&#13;
begin in these two drainage areas in January 1995 and will be completed in June 1996.&#13;
14.    Bombay Coastal Water Quality Study. This study is described in paragraph 3 ii, above. The&#13;
study will assess the effects on coastal waters of discharging effluent through outfalls from the Worli,&#13;
Bandra, Malad and Versova drainage areas at various locations in the coastal area described.&#13;
15.    Flow Studies. Flow studies similar to those described for the Worli and Bandra drainage&#13;
areas will be implemented by MCGB for the Versova and Malad drainage areas. In executing these&#13;
studies the following additional factors will be recognized: increased water supplies from Municipal&#13;
and other sources; population growth; the capacity of the existing conveyance system; constraints&#13;
imposed by the existing infrastructure; the effects of possible improvements of that infrastructure; and&#13;
the potential for reuse of treated sewage effluent. The study will begin in 1995 and will be an&#13;
ongoing exercise as forecast flows are compared with actual flows.&#13;
16.   The Feasibility Study. The feasibility will be similar to that described in paragraph 3 iii&#13;
above, but with some variations in the scope of work to suit conditions on the particular drainage&#13;
areas. Under the agreed schedule, proposals for the study will be invited from consultants in June&#13;
1996, consultants would be appointed and the study would begin in October 1997. The study is&#13;
scheduled for completion in October 1999.&#13;
17.   The scope of work for the feasibility study will include:&#13;
(a)  review of flow forecasts to the year 2020;&#13;
(b)  review of the BCWQS information;&#13;
(c)   procurement of contracts for site investigation;&#13;
(d)  examination of alternative methods for upgrading the existing sewerage system to meet&#13;
development needs to the year 2020;&#13;
(e)  examination of sewage treatment options;&#13;
(f)   assessment of the required locations and lengths of outfall(s);&#13;
(g)   assessment of land requirements and availability;&#13;
(h)  estimates of costs and environmental benefits of different options;&#13;
(i)  estimates of capital costs and operation and maintenance costs;&#13;
(j)  supervision of site investigations;&#13;
(k)  recommendations for the Second Stage of sewage treat,m,nt and disposal development;&#13;
(I)   preparation of an implementation program and a schedule of financing requirements; and&#13;

18.    Land Acquisition. With the acceptance of the feasibility study report. land acquisition is&#13;
scheduled to begin in October 1999 and to be completed in the year 2001.&#13;
19.   Detailed Engineering Designs. On completion of the feasibility studies, proposals will be&#13;
invited from consultants for the preparation of detailed engineering designs and procurement&#13;
documents for works recommended in the feasibility studies. The schedule would follow the outline&#13;
above (items 24 and 25), construction contracts for the Second Stage Program for the Versova and&#13;
Malad drainage areas would be awarded in January 2004, and works would be completed in 2009.&#13;
The Bhandup and Ghatkopar Drainage Areas&#13;
Factors Influencing the Second Stage Program&#13;
20.    Aerated lagoons would be constructed to treat sewage from these two drainage areas under the&#13;
First Stage Program. Effluent from these lagoons would be discharged to Thane creek. Recently&#13;
completed receiving water quality studies of Thane creek indicate that beyond the year 2015 other&#13;
forms of sewage treatment and/or disposal would be necessary if the quality of the creek water is to&#13;
be maintained at an acceptable level.&#13;
21.   In addition, increased sewage flows are forecast for these drainage areas as a result of in-&#13;
migration of the rural population and a sharp increase in residential development. Plans to rehouse&#13;
that section of the population at present occupying temporary housing and plans to improve the water&#13;
supply situation may also generate additional sewage flows. Against this forecast trend, the&#13;
Ghatkopar drainage area is heavily industrialized and there is growing demand for sewage to be&#13;
treated for reuse by industry, which may reduce the flows to Thane creek, depending on the method&#13;
adopted by industry for the disposal of the wastewater after its reuse. It is evident that to maintain&#13;
the quality of Thane creek at an acceptable level, planning of the Second Stage Program for these two&#13;
drainage areas would need to be implemented in line with that for other drainage areas.&#13;
Details of the Second Stage Program&#13;
22.    Flow Studies. Studies implemented in 1993 indicate that sewage flows in the Ghatkopar&#13;
drainage area are lower than those forecast in the Master Plan Study. However there is a much&#13;
higher growth potential than was previously forecast. In the Bhandup drainage area, a recent rapid&#13;
assessment of sewage flows suggests that they are significantly larger than was originally forecast.&#13;
Further study of the growth potential in these two drainage area are, therefore, a prerequisite for&#13;
planning future sewage treatment and disposal facilities. Such a study is to be implemented by&#13;
MCGB using a team of their own engineers, beginning in mid-1995. The findings of the study will&#13;
be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect the changing flow pattern and to compare forecast and&#13;
actual flows.&#13;
23.    Thane Creek Water Ouality Study. Recent studies of Thane creek to assess the effects on the&#13;
creek of the First Stage facilities indicated that the assimilative capacity of the creek was limited,&#13;
primarily by the lack of tidal flushing and the limited natural inflow to the creek. MCGB is now&#13;
considering authorizing further studies of a greater portion of the creek to more accurately assess its&#13;
assimilative capacity and the effects of discharging effluent from,the aerated lagoons at different&#13;
locations. This study is scheduled to begin in September 1995 and to be completed early in 1997.&#13;

24.    The Feasibility Study. The feasibility will be similar to those described (above) for other&#13;
drainage areas but with some variations in the scope of work to suit conditions in the Bhandup and&#13;
Ghatkopar drainage areas. Under the agreed schedule, proposals for the study will be invited from&#13;
consultants in June 1996, consultants would be appointed and the study would begin in June 1997.&#13;
The study is scheduled for completion in June 1999.&#13;
25.    The scope of work for the feasibility study will include:&#13;
(a)  review of flow forecasts to the year 2020;&#13;

(g)   assessment of land requirements and availability;&#13;
(h)  estimates of costs and environmental benefits of different options;&#13;
(i)   estimates of capital costs and operation and maintenance costs;&#13;
(j)  supervision of site investigations;&#13;
(k)  recommendations, for the Second Stage Program, for sewage treatment and disposal&#13;
development;&#13;
(I)   preparation of an implementation program and a schedule of financing requirements; and&#13;
(m)  recommendations for staffing and training.&#13;
26.    Land Acquisition. Land acquisition (and resettlement procedures if required) would begin on&#13;
completion of the feasibility study report. This could prove to be a difficult issue in the case of these&#13;
two drainage areas.&#13;
27.    Detailed Engineering Designs. As for other drainage areas discussed above, on completion of&#13;
the feasibility studies, proposals will be invited from consultants for the preparation of detailed&#13;
engineering designs and procurement documents for works recommended in the feasibility studies.&#13;
The schedule would follow the outline above (items 41 and 42), construction of facilities for the&#13;
Second Stage Program for the Bhandup and Ghatkopar drainage areas would begin in the year 2003&#13;
and would be completed in 2006.&#13;
Note on Staffing and Training for All Feasibility Studies&#13;
28.    The terns of reference for all feasibility studies would require the consultants appointed to&#13;
address the requirements for operation and maintenance staff and the training of that staff prior to the&#13;
completion of the work. All MCGB electrical and mechanical staff who would be assigned to operate&#13;
the completed plants would be required to work with the installation teams during erection and&#13;
commissioning of the plants to ensure their familiarity with the facility that they are to operate.&#13;

BOMBAY SEWAGE DISPOSAL PROJECT&#13;
PROGRESS REPORTING AND PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
1.    Page 2 of this Annex gives a tabulation of the topics that will come within the purview of&#13;
supervision by the Bank either by correspondence from headquarters, through supervision missions or&#13;
both.&#13;
2.    In principle, the responsibility for supervising and managing the Project lies with MCGB.&#13;
The essential aim of Bank supervision is supervision of the loan agreements but an additional aim will&#13;
be to assist MCGB with advice in addressing issues which arise.&#13;
3.    Accordingly, assurances will be sought at negotiations that MCGB will furnish promftlv&#13;
within thirty days after the end of each quarter. a Proiect Progress Report which covers the topics&#13;
listed on page 2 of this Annex, and which is in a form decided in consultation with the Bank.&#13;
4.    Although the Bank needs to be kept informed by the kind of Project Progress Report&#13;
described in para 3, the preparation of such a report, and the maintenance of the systems and records&#13;
which permit its preparation, is also aimed at aiding MCGB's effective management of the Project&#13;
and its staff reporting, as may be required, to such bodies as the Standing Committee of the Bombay&#13;
Corporation. Additionally, the availability to both MCGB and Bank supervision staff, of the kind of&#13;
information to be contained in such reports, greatly assists the development effectiveness of the&#13;
mission's time, which can thus be concentrated on addressing issues in consultation with MCGB and&#13;
not taken up with routine data-gathering, assembly and analysis.&#13;
5.    A "Provisional Bank Supervision Plan" is given on page 3 of this Annex. Its features&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)  generally two mission per year of implementation (usually one comprehensive and the other&#13;
more selective);&#13;
(b)  a heavier than average Bank staff time input near the beginning of the Project. This is partly&#13;
because of the higher than average Bank staff time required to deal with procurement matters&#13;
which are concentrated near the beginning of the Project. It is also to aid start-up and a full&#13;
MCGB understanding of Bank requirements - particularly in the areas of (i) progress&#13;
reporting; (ii) procurement of goods/works and of consultants; (iii) withdrawal requests&#13;
(disbursements); and (iv) accounts and audit;&#13;
(c)  declining Bank staff time inputs over the life of the Project for an average of 17.1 staff-weeks&#13;
per year;&#13;
(d)  a Mid-Term Review in September 1999; and&#13;
(e)  an ICR mission in the Fall of 2002.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
BOMBAY SEWAGE DISPOSAL PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
1.    MCGB's Water Supply and Sewerage Department's (WSSD) fiscal year runs from April 1&#13;
through March 31 of the following calendar year. The four years shown in the attached financial&#13;
statements represent MCGB's recent operating history from April 1, 1991 to March 31, 1995&#13;
(budgeted). Projections thereafter are for fiscal years 1995/96 estimated to 1999/2000. Projections&#13;
are made in November 27, 1994.&#13;
2.    The Income and Expenditure statement (Table I), the Balance Sheet (Table II) and Sources&#13;
and Application of Funds (Table III) were prepared by WSSD's Finance Department. These&#13;
statements include actual (FY92-FY95) and projected (FY96-FY2000) figures.&#13;
3.    Table IV and Table V provide detailed statements on revenues and costs.&#13;
4.    Table VI depicts the water demand and supply patterns upon which revenue calculations have&#13;
been based. It will be noted that transmission and distribution losses have been assumed to decline&#13;
from 32% in FY95 to 26% in FY2002.&#13;
5.    The projections include the capital costs, operation and maintenance costs and revenue&#13;
implications from greater sales/coverage for the Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project.&#13;
The project provides a total increment of 455 million liters of water per day (mld). 90 mld per day&#13;
was provided in 1993/94 and the remaining 365 mld will be provided in 1996/97.&#13;
6.    Capital Expenditures include a) Phase II (BSDP) from FY96 to FY2000; b) Phase III: Third&#13;
Bombay Water Supply Sewerage Project from FY86 to FY97; c) Phase IV: Fourth Bombay Water&#13;
Supply and Sewerage Project from FY97 onwards; and d) BRIM-STOWAD and Storm Water Drains&#13;
are sourced from internally generated funds&#13;
7.    The revenue projections are based on the present tariff levels which include the tariff increase&#13;
of 1993/1994 and of 1994/95. An annual increase of 10% has been assumed for the rateable value&#13;
basis.&#13;
8.    The World Bank will fund 65 % of project costs for the Second Water Supply Project. 35 %&#13;
will be sourced by internally generated funds from MCGB. Details of the cost sharing are given in&#13;
Annex 4.&#13;
Revenues and Operating Costs&#13;
9.    Revenues comprise of water revenues and sewerage revenues. These include:&#13;
a) revenues from metered consumers (charged mostly to industrial and larger domestic&#13;
consumers);&#13;
b) revenues from unmetered consumers (tariffs mostly to domestic) charged on a flat rate&#13;
basis;&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 8&#13;
c) a benefit tax based on the rental value (RV) of the property; and&#13;
d) a sewerage tax which is 50% of the water bill.&#13;
10.   Transmission and Distribution Losses. Losses have been assumed at 20% throughout the&#13;
projection period.&#13;
11.   Operating Expenses. In making the projections, the number of employees are kept constant.&#13;
On a yearly basis, wages are increased at 18%, chemicals at 16%, power at 16%, materials at 5%,&#13;
transport at 10% and operational expenditures for Storm Water Drainage Project at 12%. With the&#13;
exception of materials, each of the categories include an 8% inflation rate. The completion of the&#13;
Third Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project will have a direct effect on operating costs from&#13;
1996/97 onwards.&#13;
12.   Interest and Depreciation. Depreciation of fixed assets is based on the straight-line method,&#13;
at 2.5% per annum.&#13;
Working Capital&#13;
18.   Cash. Minimum cash requirement is assumed to be two months of operating and capital&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
19.   Inventory represents a three month supply of chemicals, and materials together with 10% of&#13;
annual capital expenditures to cover stocks of cement, steel and other items.&#13;
20.   Accounts Receivables other than those from customers are assumed to represent three months&#13;
of advanced capital expenditures. Customer accounts receivable are predicted at collection&#13;
efficiencies of 75 % through FY2000.&#13;
21.   Accounts Payable relate to the money due from WSSD to contractors and suppliers pending&#13;
settlement of their bills (connected largely with capital works). It represents one month of capital&#13;
expenditure, direct operating costs, and administrative expenses and is projected to increase in&#13;
proportion to capital work-in-progress.&#13;
Internal Cash Generation&#13;
22.   MCGB will need to increase water and sewerage tariffs in FY98. in FY99. and in FY2000 to&#13;
ensure that internal funds are available to cover at least 35% of its capital expenditures in any year.&#13;

BOMBAY SEWAGE DISPOSAL PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY&#13;
The Environmental Assessment Process&#13;
1.    The environmental assessment (EA) for the project was undertaken by National Environmental&#13;
Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) under contract to Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay&#13;
(MCGB), beginning in September 1991. Initially the EA was designed to meet the requirements of&#13;
GOI Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 and the provisions of World Bank OD 4.00 Annex A,&#13;
Environmental Assessment, applicable to Category A projects. Because the IEPS was issued prior to&#13;
October 1, 1991, the project was not technically subject to OD 4.01 which superseded OD 4.00&#13;
Annex A; however, the workplan was modified to meet the changes in procedure as fully as possible&#13;
without disrupting work in progress. The EA process was further modified to comply with BP 17.50,&#13;
Disclosure of Operational Information, when it became effective for IBRD-financed projects on&#13;
January 1, 1994.&#13;
2.    The primary objectives of the EA were: (i) to ascertain if the facilities then being proposed&#13;
as project components (described in Annexes 2 and 3) would be adequate to provide the desired&#13;
environmental benefits; (ii) if inadequacies were identified, to examine alternatives that would achieve&#13;
the desired benefits; and (iii) to develop a Mitigation Plan to address potential adverse impacts of&#13;
construction and operation. Because of the extensive field investigations and hydrologic and water&#13;
quality modeling required, the EA work was undertaken in three segments, each covering two of the&#13;
six drainage areas the project was originally planned to cover (see drainage area description below).&#13;
The Final Report on Marine Outfalls and the Final Report on the Aerated Lagoons at Bhandup and&#13;
Ghatkopar were made available for public inspection and comment and officially submitted to the&#13;
Bank in January 1995. The report on Aerated Lagoons at Malad and Versova was not officially&#13;
submitted to the Bank, because MCGB decided to drop these lagoons from the project on the basis of&#13;
the findings reported in the draft EA report (see paras. 47 - 49 for details), but a copy of the final&#13;
report has been placed in the project files.&#13;

Environmental Assessment Methodology&#13;
Marine Outfalls&#13;
3.     As a baseline for assessment of potential improvement in coastal water quality, existing&#13;
conditions were determined through extensive field surveys. The surveys were conducted during&#13;
winter of 1991 (non-monsoon conditions) and summer of 1992 (monsoon conditions) and involved&#13;
collection of 220 water and sediment samples along 24 kilometers of Bombay's coastline. Samples&#13;
were analyzed for their relevant physical, chemical, bacteriological and biological characteristics.&#13;
Ambient air quality, micrometeorology, noise levels, soil characteristics and land use patterns near the&#13;
outfall construction sites were studied. Socioeconomic surveys and some interviews were also&#13;
conducted in residential areas near the construction sites, in fishermenA communities, and at&#13;
recreational beaches to ascertain the identity and concerns of affected groups.&#13;
4.     The water quality impacts of the outfalls as proposed were predicted in terms of three main&#13;
parameters , dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and total coliform bacteria&#13;
(the basis of the GOI coastal marine water quality standard), using mathematical models to simulate&#13;
initial dilution and advective-dispersive processes. These models were calibrated for local&#13;
environmental conditions through in-situ and laboratory experiments. They were also applied in the&#13;
analysis of alternative combinations of outfall lengths and levels of wastewater treatment. For&#13;
environmental processes involving more complex interactions, such as nutrient enrichment,&#13;
bioaccumulation of heavy metals, and ecological transformations of chemical compounds, the&#13;
approach of observation at and inference from regions which have been receiving similar wastewater&#13;
discharges over a long period was adopted for the prediction of impacts.&#13;
5.     To assess the potential construction phase impacts, field investigations on sources of noise&#13;
and air pollution during construction were conducted. Ground vibration data for blasting operations&#13;
from previous construction in Bombay were also collected. A mathematical model was used to&#13;
predict the impacts of blasting operations on structures and to establish charge limits. Ambient noise&#13;
levels in surrounding communities were also predicted by a model.&#13;
Aerated Lagoons&#13;
6.     The environmental status of Thane Creek, the receiving water for the proposed Bhandup and&#13;
Ghatkopar lagoons, was determined through extensive physical, chemical, and biological surveys of&#13;
winter and summer conditions. Hydrodynamic and bathymetric data were also collected as inputs to&#13;
the mathematical models used to predict DO and BOD5 concentrations in the creek after construction&#13;
of the lagoons. These models were calibrated for local environmental conditions through in-situ and&#13;
laboratory experiments. They were also applied in the analysis of alternatives. For processes&#13;
involving highly complex interactions such as nutrient enrichment, bioaccumulation and ecological&#13;
transformations, the approach of observation at and inference from regions that have been receiving&#13;
similar wastewater discharges over a long period was adopted for the prediction of impacts.&#13;
7.     For estimation of construction phase impacts, field investigations on ambient air quality,&#13;
noise levels, creek and coastal water quality were conducted. Land-use patterns and soil&#13;
characteristics near the construction sites were also studied. The area under mangrove cover was&#13;
determined through use of satellite imagery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

8.     The observations and model predictions were used to examine the efficacy of proposed single&#13;
and three cell aerated lagoons in achieving the desired environmental benefits. Probable augmentations&#13;
of the proposed treatment effort catering to increased flows by the year 2015 and after, in the forms&#13;
of higher treatment and options for wastewater disposal at new locations in the creek, were evaluated.&#13;
The scope for additional field observations and modeling work to finalize such options was also&#13;
highlighted.&#13;
9.     Similar methodology was followed in the assessment of the likely impacts of lagoons proposed&#13;
to be constructed at Malad and Versova, on Malad Creek.&#13;
Baseline Environmental Conditions&#13;
Coastal Marine Waters, Beaches, and Bandra and Worli Outfall Sites&#13;
10.   The primary impacts of the present wastewater discharges at the shoreline are manifested in&#13;
terms of poor water quality in many regions along the western coast. Higher levels of pollution are&#13;
observed during the ebb tide in comparison to the flood tide. Observations on bacterial quality along&#13;
the coast show frequent occurrence of total coliform concentrations between 104 to 101 per 100 ml for&#13;
about one third of the 24 kilometer long coastline. Only about 25 per cent of the total observations&#13;
showed compliance with the present GOI bacterial standard, which is total coliform bacteria not to&#13;
exceed 1,000 colonies per 100 ml (TC &lt; 1,000/100 ml) at any time at or within 1 km ("the&#13;
reference line") of the shore. Bacterial quality of water at three of the four main recreational beaches&#13;
of Bombay also reveals moderate to high levels of pollution (TC between 10,000 and 100,000/100&#13;
ml), indicating health risk to bathers.&#13;
11.   Concentrations of BODS at the 1 km  "reference line" are generally low (less than 5 mg/I)&#13;
indicating considerable dilution and decay of the organic matter from wastewater before the pollutants&#13;
have traveled far from shore. Ammonia nitrogen (also often associated with wastewater discharges,&#13;
even after treatment), is present in concentrations in the range of mildly polluted coastal waters&#13;
whereas phosphorus concentrations are close to levels observed in clean sea. The nutrient levels&#13;
(nitrogen and phosphorus) in sediments are observed to be higher during winter than summer. These&#13;
levels, however, are similar in polluted and clean regions and therefore do not indicate accumulation&#13;
of nutrients in sediments due to sewage discharges.&#13;
12.   Amongst the phytoplankton, frequent occurrences of pollutant indicator groups like&#13;
Cyanophyceae (blue-green algae) have been found in many of the regions which also show higher&#13;
pollution in terms of physico-chemical and bacterial parameters. This observation signifies that the&#13;
contamination of coastal waters due to organic pollutants is persistent enough to affect ecosystem&#13;
characteristics.&#13;
13.   The chemical analysis does not indicate any significant contamination of water or sediments&#13;
by toxic metals or toxic organic compounds (e.g., pesticides). The possible explanation for these&#13;
observations lies in the low levels of metals and toxic organics observed during sampling of the&#13;
wastewater. The sediments and water samples, even from those regions which exhibits higher&#13;
bacterial contamination and low DO, do not show significant variations in trace organic /inorganic&#13;
concentrations when compared with levels from clean regions.&#13;
14.   Interviews with users of the three most popular beaches indicate that though many people are&#13;
frequent visitors to the beaches, they avoid bathing and swimming due to visibly poor water quality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 4 of 22&#13;
Among the three beaches, Juhu Beach is most scenic and is also relatively least polluted. Dadar and&#13;
Girgaum beaches are highly polluted due to their proximity to wastewater discharges.&#13;
15.   Water quality conditions near Malad Creek and Mahim Creek which discharge wastewater&#13;
into the coastal area are extremely poor -- low DO, high BOD5 and high TC levels. The anaerobic&#13;
conditions in both creeks during low tide cause obnoxious odor in their immediate vicinity. The&#13;
problem is particularly significant in Mahim Creek, since it cuts across some densely populated&#13;
sections of the city.&#13;
16.   Ambient air quality analysis at Worli and Bandra outfall sites was carried out for assessment&#13;
of construction phase impacts. The results indicate that present air quality in terms of suspended&#13;
particulate matter (SPM), nitrogen oxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) at both sites meet Indian&#13;
standards for ambient air quality. The values for Worli, however, suggest that the capacity to&#13;
assimilate additional quantities of air pollutants is lower there. Similarly, recorded on noise levels at&#13;
Worli slightly exceed the upper threshold limit prescribed for urban residential/commercial areas.&#13;
Thane Creek and Bhandup and Ghatkopar Lagoon Sites&#13;
17.   Thane Creek, in its inner regions, receives approximately 400 mld of untreated wastewater&#13;
from Bhandup and Ghatkopar drainage areas, plus an undetermined volume of wastewater from&#13;
municipal and industrial sources on the eastern shore (i.e., outside the administrative boundaries of&#13;
MCGB). Due to shallow depths and narrow cross-section, the creek in this region does not have&#13;
sufficient capacity to assimilate these discharges. As a result, about 10 km of the stream along the&#13;
west bank of the creek exhibits poor water quality characterized by low DO and elevated levels of&#13;
BOD5 , suspended solids, and total coliform. Concentrations of BOD5 as high as 7 mg/l and&#13;
TC&gt; 104/100 ml are common, and observations on biological indicators indicate that the aquatic biota&#13;
is exposed to long-term stress. Creek sediments also show high concentration of nitrogen, denoting&#13;
accumulation of nutrients due to large wastewater discharges. Heavy metals in sediments at about ten&#13;
times the concentrations found along the Bombay seacoast are evidence of substantial industrial&#13;
discharges to Thane Creek, but the concentrations are not generally high enough to exceed known&#13;
tolerance limits of aquatic biota. Wastewater from the Bhandup and Ghatkopar service zones does not&#13;
exhibit significantly higher metal concentrations than in wastewater from Bandra and Worli.&#13;
18.   Ambient air quality analyses at Bhandup and Ghatkopar aerated lagoon sites indicate that the&#13;
present air quality in terms of NO2 and SO2 at both sites meets Indian standards for ambient air&#13;
quality. Observations on noise levels at the lagoon sites indicate that these are within the limit&#13;
prescribed for urban residential areas.&#13;
19.    The sites proposed for both lagoons are at the edge of tidal flats that are partially covered by&#13;
mangroves in relatively good condition. There are no residential communities or other land uses in&#13;
the immediate vicinity that would be incompatible with a wastewater treatment plant.&#13;

Construction of the Outfalls&#13;
20.    The major construction activities are blasting, tunneling, and material transfer at the sites of&#13;
Worli and Bandra headworks. Additional tasks for the outfall construction will be the manufacture of&#13;
precast concrete lining segments and the disposal of excavated material. The main potential adverse&#13;
impacts of these activities are vibrations due to blasting, rise in ambient noise levels, impairnent of&#13;
air quality near the construction sites, and locally impaired water quality due to the trenching at the&#13;
diffuser section.&#13;
21.    No adverse impacts on nearby structures due to blasting are predicted to occur if charge sizes&#13;
are restricted to 4.5 and 5 kg at Worli and Bandra respectively. Safe peak particle velocities of 20&#13;
mm/sec for concrete structures and 8 mm/sec for poor structures have been considered in reaching&#13;
these conclusions.&#13;
22.    Data on the noise characteristics of construction machinery and observations on an operating&#13;
tunnel boring machine indicated that noise levels may reach 96 dBA near the most noisy machinery.&#13;
Noise levels at about 100 meters from the construction sites will fall below 55 dBA and will,&#13;
therefore, be within the acceptable levels for outdoor noise levels in an urban residential area. The&#13;
sensitive receptors at both Bandra and Worli are more than 100 meters from the sites.&#13;
23.    Hauling of construction materials to and from both construction sites and of excavated&#13;
material from Worli to Bandra will cause traffic congestion on roads around the construction sites.&#13;
24.    During the construction activities at outfall headworks, marginal increases in concentrations of&#13;
air pollutants such as NO1, and SO2 are expected. The rise over the ambient levels, however, will be&#13;
negligible as the additional emissions from the construction activities will constitute only small&#13;
fractions of present emissions which are primarily from automobile exhausts. Also, due to their&#13;
proximity to the coast, the sites experience strong diurnal land-sea breezes which disperse the&#13;
pollutants effectively. A more significant rise in SPM levels, however, is expected during the&#13;
construction activities.&#13;
25.    The construction of tunnel outfalls will not have any significant impact on the coastal water&#13;
quality, as tunneling will take place at about 50-70 meters below the seabed. For such construction&#13;
the proper disposal of excavated material, generated at a rate of about 500 tons per day for about 15&#13;
months, will pose a challenge. This material will be composed of tuff and basalt and will be used&#13;
for reclamation of additional land near the Bandra outfall headworks. In the already severely&#13;
disturbed area, the reclamation itself will not have any significant ecological effect, but suspended&#13;
solids concentrations in the nearby waters will increase if water draining from the excavated material&#13;
is not properly managed.&#13;
26.    No adverse impact on fishing interests in the region is expected to result from outfall&#13;
construction, other than temporary constraints on navigation. Some localized, transient water quality&#13;
impact due to the spillage of fuel and oils used for operation of construction machinery may occur. If&#13;
improperly handled, human waste and solid waste from the construction crews will adversely affect&#13;
surrounding neighborhoods. These impacts can be minimized with good housekeeping and vigilance.&#13;

Construction of the Lagoons&#13;
27.    The major construction activities are site clearance, land filling, earth work, quarrying and&#13;
material transfer. The single most important adverse impact of these activities is the loss of about 40&#13;
hectares of mangrove cover amounting to 5 percent of total area of mangrove forest in inner Thane&#13;
Creek. This is an unavoidable impact and, considering the role of mangroves in the sustenance of&#13;
coastal ecosystems, it requires compensation.&#13;
28.    The other prominent impacts during the construction are rise in ambient noise levels and&#13;
marginal increase in air borne pollutants like SPM at the construction site. The higher SPM levels are&#13;
likely to be observed for short intervals only during peak periods of construction activities. There will&#13;
be insignificant increase in the gaseous pollutants such as SO2 and NOx.&#13;
29.    Predictions of noise levels from construction machinery at sensitive locations, which are more&#13;
than 1 km distant from the lagoon sites, indicate they will be attenuated to about 40 dBA -- i.e., the&#13;
measured background levels now.&#13;
30.   Construction of the aerated lagoons will not have any adverse impacts on creek water quality&#13;
or fishing interests as all construction activities except for the effluent channel will be restricted to&#13;
land. The construction is not expected to have significant impacts on drainage characteristics of the&#13;
region. However, it will be important to avoid blocking any natural drainage channel in the vicinity&#13;
of lagoons, so that local flooding does not occur.&#13;
Operation of the Outfalls&#13;
31.    The impacts associated with operation of the marine outfalls are essentially beneficial; chief&#13;
among them will be considerable improvement in the physico-chemical quality of the coastal waters.&#13;
Moving the points of wastewater discharge 3 km offshore will fully eliminate the dissolved oxygen&#13;
depletion which presently occurs during the low tide near the Mahim coast. Reduction in nutrient&#13;
loading along with improvement in DO will considerably improve the ecological health of nearshore&#13;
waters in the region. These improvements will contribute towards elimination of odor nuisance and&#13;
enhancement of beach aesthetics and water use. It is important to note, however, that the full benefit&#13;
of the outfall investment will not be realized until dry weather flows of sanitary sewage from storm&#13;
drains are abated and solutions are found for the wastewater generated in slum communities not&#13;
connected to the conveyance system.&#13;
32.    The discharge of wastewater through marine outfalls will not cause environmentally adverse&#13;
conditions -- e.g., low dissolved oxygen or high nutrient concentrations in the water column -- even&#13;
in the vicinity of outfalls. The initial dilution is more than 50 times during most of the tidal cycle,&#13;
and the DO and BOD5 levels near the outfall diffuser section will therefore be more than 4 mg/l and&#13;
less than 3 mg/l, respectively. However, if peak dry weather flow coincides with the tidal slack&#13;
period, BOD5 levels of up to 20 mg/l are probable in the immediate vicinity of outfalls. The&#13;
probability of such an occurrence is less than 0.01, and because the concentration will fall below 5&#13;
mg/l soon after the tidal currents resume, there will not be a protracted negative influence on DO.&#13;
33.    Observations in the immediate vicinity of Colaba outfall (a small outfall in operation since&#13;
1988) discharging sewage off the east coast of Bombay, indicate no significant accumulation of&#13;
organic matter, nutrients or metals in the sediments. Since similar dilution and coastal currents are&#13;
expected near the diffuser section of proposed outfalls, no significant adverse impacts on sediment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 7 of 22&#13;
quality are expected. Due to low levels of metals and trace organics in the sewage, their&#13;
concentrations in the water column or sediments in the vicinity of outfalls will also remain close to&#13;
the ambient levels.&#13;
34.    As the operation of outfalls does not result in impairment of water and sediment quality even&#13;
near the diffuser section, no adverse effect is expected on marine biota or on the fish yield in the&#13;
region. It is possible that increased fish yield may be obtained in coastal regions near Bandra and&#13;
Worli due to improved water quality conditions. However, because it is likely that factors other than&#13;
water quality deterioration have contributed to the decline in yields observed over the last ten years&#13;
(e.g., overfishing, increase in the number of trawlers), water quality improvement alone may not&#13;
reverse the trend.&#13;
35.    The 3 km long outfalls are not expected to improve the bacterial quality of the coastal waters&#13;
to the level specified in the GOI standard and the Notice of Consent to Discharge issued by the&#13;
Maharasthra Pollution Control Board. (TC &lt; 1,000/100 ml at the 1 km reference line). Even after&#13;
commissioning of the outfalls, about one-third of the length of the reference line will exhibit&#13;
violations of the standard under adverse meteorological conditions. During the monsoon season, the&#13;
bacterial counts are likely to exceed the standard by 100 times, and by about 50 times during the non-&#13;
monsoon season. When compared to existing conditions, both the bacterial levels and the length of&#13;
coastline in violation of the standard are expected to decrease by about 50%. To achieve further&#13;
improvement, longer outfalls and perhaps a higher level of wastewater treatment will be necessary.&#13;
36.    The EA points out, however, that the GOI bacterial standard is unnecessarily stringent, even&#13;
in comparison to EEC and US standards. It should be reconsidered in four respects. First, the limit&#13;
set for the chosen indicator organism, total coliform bacteria, is overly conservative. A limit of&#13;
10,000 is commonly thought to be sufficient to protect bathers from pathogens; it is the basis of the&#13;
EEC standard, for example. Second, standards for bathing water normally allow for statistical&#13;
variation. Thus the EEC requires that 95% of samples taken fall below the 10,000 limit, as compared&#13;
to the 100% compliance specified by GOI. The US state of Florida applies a 1,000 TC/100 ml&#13;
standard, but requires compliance in 80% of samples. Third, bathing water standards in many&#13;
countries are either only in force during the bathing season or allow for unusual weather conditions.&#13;
If that concept were embodied in GOI standards, requirements for the monsoon season (for which the&#13;
model predicts larger and more frequent violations) would be less stringent than for non-monsoon.&#13;
Finally, samples are usually required to be taken from the bathing waters themselves -- i.e., near the&#13;
beach, rather than at a line 1 km offshore where recreational swimming does not occur. The EA&#13;
includes a recommendation that the standard be revised before any decision is made regarding the&#13;
next stage of sewage disposal works for Bombay. Adoption of the EEC standard, for example, could&#13;
reduce the final length of outfall required while maintaining bathing water quality at internationally&#13;
accepted levels. In recognition of these circumstances, in both the MPCB "consent to discharge" and&#13;
the GOI environmental clearance, the construction of 3-km in this project is approved and the need&#13;
for revised standards which would apply to the Second Stage Program is acknowledged. The designs&#13;
for the 3-km outfalls have been modified to facilitate their eventual extension.&#13;
Operation of the Bhandup and Ghatkopar Lagoons&#13;
37.   The EA also raises questions about the effluent standards applicable to the lagoons. The&#13;
effluent standard for BOD5 of 100 mg/l, which is incorporated in the MPCB Notice of Consent to&#13;
Discharge, does not take into account the receiving waters capacity to assimilate waste without&#13;
dissolved oxygen depletion and resulting degradation of the aquatic ecosystem. A GOI receiving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 8 of 22&#13;
water DO standard of 3 mg/i or 40% saturation, whichever is higher, applies to coastal creeks. If the&#13;
effluent volume is large, discharge in compliance with the effluent standard will still lead to severe&#13;
deterioration of receiving water quality. For the purposes of the EA, maintenance of DO levels of at&#13;
least 2 mg/i was used as an objective in evaluating the proposed lagoons and alternatives.&#13;
38.   It is important to note that the EA findings assume that other discharges to Thane Creek will&#13;
be given similar levels of treatment. These are outside of the jurisdiction of MCGB, however, and&#13;
the EA therefore recommends that GOM develop and implement a comprehensive water quality&#13;
management plan for the entire creek. Otherwise, much of the potential benefit of MCGBs&#13;
investments at Bhandup and Ghatkopar will not be realized.&#13;
39.    The water quality model results for Thane Creek indicate that the proposed first-stage&#13;
treatment works, single-cell aerated lagoons, will arrest the present trend of worsening water quality&#13;
but will not lead to DO concentrations that are consistently at least 2 mg/l. The higher level of&#13;
treatment planned for the second stage treatment works will be needed. (This is addressed further in&#13;
the Analysis of Alternatives section below.) In addition, a revised estimate of the flows for the year&#13;
2005 from 180 Mld to 280 Mld caused the redesign of the Bhandup laggons to prevent overloading.&#13;
40.    Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emissions in the event of aerator malfunctioning of the aerators could&#13;
lead to significant odor nuisance within a 1 km radius of the lagoons on a typical stable winter day.&#13;
However, impacts would not be significant in areas which are beyond 1.5 to 2 km distance from the&#13;
lagoons.&#13;
Analysis of Alternatives&#13;
Marine Outfalls&#13;
41.    Having concluded that the 3 km outfalls with preliminary treatment would not achieve the&#13;
required receiving water standard for total coliform, NEERI investigated eight other combinations of&#13;
outfall length and treatment level: 3 km with primary and secondary treatment and 4 and 5 km with&#13;
preliminary, primary, and secondary treatment. They also evaluated the "no action" alternative.&#13;
42.   Municipal wastewater discharges from the Bandra and Worli zones which are presently&#13;
estimated at 800 mld are expected to double by year 2005, the design period of the project. If the&#13;
proposed schemes are not implemented -- i.e., the no-action alternative is chosen, the wastewater will&#13;
continue to reach the coastal regions through the present drainage routes. The existing conditions of&#13;
gross bacterial pollution and near total DO depletion in regions near the main wastewater outlets and&#13;
moderate pollution all along the coast will further deteriorate.&#13;
43.    The analysis of other alternatives, although approximate in nature because of inadequate data&#13;
on coastal currents, indicates that only the outfalls of 5 km with secondary treatment are likely to&#13;
meet the existing bacterial standards at the reference line. Outfalls of 5 km with primary treatment&#13;
are predicted to achieve substantial but partial compliance -- 50 percent during the daytime in&#13;
monsoon season and 80 percent during non-monsoon, with poorer performance at night. These&#13;
results suggested that longer outfalls should be investigated; they are a more practical alternative to&#13;
the very difficult task of acquiring land and constructing secondary or even primary treatment&#13;
facilities in the heavily developed areas around the Bandra and Worli sites. However, analysis of&#13;
outfalls longer than 5 km, and more conclusive analysis of the shorter ones, was not possible with the&#13;
limited current data available and the limitations of the mathematical model the data could support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 9 of 22&#13;
The EA therefore recommended that the outfall designs incorporate provisions for later extensions and&#13;
that additional oceanographic surveys be conducted to support analysis of alternatives for the second&#13;
stage works. Both recommendations were accepted, and the studies are in progress (see Annex 5).&#13;
Lagoons at Bhandup and Ghatkopar&#13;
44.   The analysis of alternatives covered "no action", construction of three-cell aerated lagoons&#13;
(the second-stage plan), secondary treatment by the activated sludge process, secondary treatment with&#13;
nitrification, center-channel discharge, and flow reduction through industrial use of untreated&#13;
wastewater (since there had been tentative expressions of interest for about 50 mld). Under the no&#13;
action alternative, the creek water quality which is already impaired in terms of DO at low tide would&#13;
seriously deteriorate, since the combined present flows of the two service zones, estimated at 400&#13;
mld, are projected to increase to 520 mld by 2005 and to reach 1,000 mld in 2015.&#13;
45.   When augmented to three-cells and designed to achieve 35 mg/l or lower BOD5 in the&#13;
effluents, the aerated lagoons would provide an adequate level of pollution abatement in the affected&#13;
creek region until wastewater flows exceed the volumes projected for 2005. Water quality scenarios&#13;
developed to examine the benefits of further increases in the treatment level at Ghatkopar through use&#13;
of the activated sludge process indicate that such augmentation for 2005 flows would give rise to&#13;
only a marginal improvement of 0.3 mg/l in DO over the three-cell aerated lagoons option, and at&#13;
substantially higher cost. Shifting the effluent discharge location to the center of the creek would not&#13;
yield any significant improvement in creek DO.&#13;
46.   When extended to 2015 flows, the water quality simulations indicated that Thane Creek&#13;
cannot assimilate effluents beyond projected flows for the year 2005 at Bhandup and Ghatkopar, even&#13;
after nitrification. To accommodate higher flows, it will thus be necessary to build additional&#13;
wastewater treatment facilities and discharge the effluents at new locations in the creek. The analysis&#13;
suggests that it would be possible to discharge up to 260 mld after secondary treatment near&#13;
Vikhroli. To manage the entire increase projected from 2005 to 2015, however, would entail tertiary&#13;
level treatment. Considering the high cost of tertiary treatment and also the need to plan even&#13;
beyond the year 2015, the EA recommended that options for discharging the wastewater in other&#13;
regions of the creek be explored. If that approach makes secondary treatment sufficient, the savings&#13;
in treatment cost may more than offset the cost of conveying the wastewater to the more distant&#13;
locations.&#13;
A Note on the Lagoons at Malad and Versova&#13;
47.   Construction of two trains of three-cell lagoons is underway at Versova. Four trains were&#13;
ultimately planned. At Malad, a two-stage approach similar to that for Bhandup and Ghatkopar&#13;
would have resulted in construction of four trains of single-cell lagoons in the first stage, with&#13;
upgrading to three cells to follow. Water quality studies and mathematical modeling similar to the&#13;
work done on Thane Creek showed that while the first-stage works would comply with the MPCB&#13;
Notice of Consent to Discharge, their operation would produce virtually no improvement in Malad&#13;
Creek water quality. NEERI therefore analyzed a range of alternatives, 15 in all, including: the&#13;
completion of the planned second-stage works, advanced secondary treatment at Malad (i.e., effluent&#13;
BOD5 of 10 mg/l), the conveyance of effluent from Malad to Versova for discharge nearer the creek&#13;
mouth, the retention of Malad effluent for release during ebb tide only, dredging the creek, and&#13;
diversion of all flow from the Malad service zone for treatment and disposal at a location where it&#13;
would not be discharged to Malad Creek.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 10 of 22&#13;
48.   The analysis provided convincing evidence that due to limited assimilative capacity and&#13;
incomplete tidal flushing of the upstream reach of the creek, there was no practical treatment option&#13;
for wastewater to be discharged at the Malad site that would significantly change the present situation&#13;
in which DO concentrations in upper Malad Creek fall to near zero during low tide. The Versova&#13;
lagoons, close to the creek mouth where tidal flushing is more nearly complete, would provide some&#13;
water quality benefit in the medium term. However, preliminary projections made in 1994 indicate&#13;
that 2005 wastewater flows from both Malad and Versova service zones are likely to be 25 % higher&#13;
than the design flows. Aerated lagoon treatment at Versova would then be inadequate even with the&#13;
planned expansion to four process trains.&#13;
49.   Consequently, MCGB decided to eliminate the Malad Lagoons from this project. It intends to&#13;
complete construction of the two process trains at Versova and to treat flows only up to design&#13;
capacity. MCGB will use the Versova works to gain experience with aerated lagoon operation,&#13;
conduct pilot testing of operating procedures, and train personnel prior to the commnissioning of the&#13;
larger lagoons at Bhandup and Ghatkopar. Final solutions for both the Malad and Versova service&#13;
zones will be developed in the planning and feasibility studies and designs for the Second Stage&#13;
Program (see Annex 5).&#13;
Environmental Impact Mitigation Plans&#13;
Marine Outfalls&#13;
50.    Adverse impacts of outfall construction can be mitigated for the most part by adherence to&#13;
good construction and housekeeping practices. The exception is increased turbidity near the diffuser&#13;
sections during installation of risers, which is unavoidable but temporary and localized.&#13;
51.    Findings of the EA indicate that operation of the 3 km outfalls will provide adequate&#13;
environmental improvement for all water quality parameters except total coliform bacteria at the 1 km&#13;
reference line. The mitigation plan therefore includes the recommendations cited below.&#13;
(a)    As 3 km long outfalls at Worli and Bandra are expected to substantially improve the&#13;
existing coastal water quality without causing any significant impairment at the&#13;
discharge site, it is recommended to proceed with their construction as the initial&#13;
phase of the project. Considering the need for further extension of outfalls for&#13;
compliance of the bacterial standard, the outfall design should have provisions for&#13;
such an extension.&#13;
(a)    The hydrodynamic data on the region should be strengthened through further field&#13;
studies to facilitate use of more powerful models that will be used in planning the&#13;
Second Stage Program.&#13;
(b)    Review of present bacterial standards will be necessary to allow a practical&#13;
management option for the outfalls.&#13;
52.    Mitigation measures during operation are synonymous with sound operating practices,&#13;
supported by monitoring the condition of the outfalls. The objective is to avoid situations where&#13;
bypassing is necessary to conduct repairs or sediment removal, because the release of untreated&#13;
wastewater at the coastline will adversely affect water quality and thus marine life, aesthetic&#13;
conditions, and public health at Worli and Bandra. Monitoring of heavy metal concentrations in the&#13;
influent is also important; baseline data show that they are not present at levels that would have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 11 of 22&#13;
adverse impacts on marine life, but it is essential to detect any change in that situation so that&#13;
measures can be taken early to identify the source and eliminate it. A summary of all recommended&#13;
mitigation measures is provided in Table 1 at the end of this annex, except for recommended tree&#13;
plantations that are shown in Table 3.&#13;
Aerated Lagoons&#13;
53.   Loss of about 40 ha of relatively good quality mangrove -- 5 percent of the total mangrove&#13;
cover in inner Thane Creek -- is the most significant construction phase impact associated with the&#13;
lagoons. It is an unavoidable impact, and the EA therefore recommends compensation, either by&#13;
replanting an equal area of former mangrove habitat in the same reach of the creek or by designating&#13;
a larger tract (e.g., 200 ha) as a protected area and taking measures against future reclamation or&#13;
unauthorized cutting. (See main text para 6.17 for related condition of environmental clearance.&#13;
54.    The other potential negative impacts of lagoon construction are comparatively minor and can&#13;
be managed by adherence to good construction and house keeping practices. Recommended measures&#13;
are summarized in Table 2 at the end of this annex and should be incorporated as fully as possible in&#13;
construction contracts.&#13;
55.   The operation of single cell lagoons will comply with MPCB effluent requirements and be a&#13;
positive step towards the objective of overall water quality improvement in Thane Creek. It will&#13;
arrest further deterioration in receiving water quality. In order to achieve acceptable environmental&#13;
conditions in the vicinity of the creek, proper functioning of aerators is of prime importance.&#13;
Adequate back up systems should be incorporated in the design stage itself to ensure their continuous&#13;
and trouble-free operation. Table 2 also includes recommended mitigation measures for lagoon&#13;
operation, with the exception of recommended tree plantations shown in Table 3.&#13;
56.   Water quality in the affected region of the creek will not remain consistently above the&#13;
minimum level necessary for a healthy ecosystem with single-cell treatment.  An adequate mitigation&#13;
measure, therefore, would be to construct three-cell aerated lagoons at this stage or to augment the&#13;
lagoons to three-cell configuration as soon as possible. For significant improvement in creek water&#13;
quality, the lagoons should be designed to produce effluents with BOD5 below 35 mg/l. Considering&#13;
that they would remain effective only for flows projected up to the year 2005, the recommended long-&#13;
term management approach is to develop additional treatment units with facilities to discharge the&#13;
effluent at new locations within the creek. One suitable discharge location has been identified near&#13;
Vikhroli; it has the potential to assimilate about 260 mld of effluents after secondary treatment.&#13;
Additional water quality modeling studies are recommended to assess assimilative capacity of the&#13;
creek south of Tromby and identify other possible points for effluent discharge for the year 2015 and&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
57.    The full water quality benefits of the investments that MCGB plans to make on Thane Creek&#13;
will not be realized unless all wastewater flowing to the creek is treated to levels comparable to those&#13;
planned for Bhandup and Ghatkopar. It is imperative that a comprehensive management plan be&#13;
developed for the creek and implemented by all dischargers. Because this involves multiple&#13;
jurisdictions, the plan should be developed by GOM, and compliance should be enforced by MPCB.&#13;
This task should be undertaken immediately.&#13;

Environmental Monitoring Plans&#13;
Marine Outfalls&#13;
58.   Recommended monitoring measures for the outfalls are included in Table lat the end of this&#13;
annex. Regular environmental monitoring should begin immediately and continue during the&#13;
construction and post-commissioning phases. During the pre-commissioning phase, samples collected&#13;
from important beaches and seafronts should be analyzed for bacterial contamination and dissolved&#13;
oxygen. The critical period of the tidal cycle corresponding to elevated pollution levels at sampling&#13;
locations should be identified first, by sampling at two hourly interval (only daytime hours) for a&#13;
week. Year long sampling should then be undertaken at that period with the frequency of 10 samples&#13;
per month.&#13;
59.   Samples at selected locations at the reference line should be collected on alternate days for 15&#13;
days, once every year in winter and once in summer, to establish a database on existing coastal water&#13;
quality. The samples should be collected at low tide slack and should be analyzed for relevant&#13;
physicochemical, biological and bacteriological parameters. Sediment samples should also be collected&#13;
and analyzed for benthos, nutrients and heavy metals.&#13;
60.   During the construction phase additional samples, once every week, should be collected near&#13;
the construction head and analyzed for physicochemical parameters. Visual inspection, once a day,&#13;
should be conducted to detect any oil leaks from offshore construction machinery. Noise and air&#13;
pollution levels should also be monitored at the construction sites and if required mitigation actions&#13;
should be taken to ensure compliance with the standards. Additionally, daily visual inspection of&#13;
roads and roadsides in the vicinity of the construction site should be undertaken to identify any&#13;
nuisance that need attention with respect to dust, spill of construction materials or debris etc.&#13;
61.   Post-commissioning monitoring similar to that for the pre-commissioning period should be&#13;
undertaken. During this phase, water samples at the beaches and seafronts and locations on reference&#13;
line situated at North of Worli should be collected during low and high tide slack and at South of&#13;
Worli at low tide slack.&#13;
62.   The effluents from grit removal facilities should be regularly analyzed for grit content and&#13;
heavy metals.&#13;
Aerated Lagoons&#13;
63.   A systematic water quality monitoring effort within Thane Creek should be initiated before&#13;
and after commissioning the aerated lagoons, in the areas influenced by each lagoon. At the&#13;
post-commissioning stage, the monitoring should be aimed at verifying the water quality projections&#13;
and validating the water quality model used in the present study. This will help to ascertain the&#13;
modelA usefulness in future wastewater management planning for Thane Creek. A regular effluent&#13;
monitoring program to establish the performance characteristics for the treatment system should be&#13;
undertaken immediately after commissioning the treatment systems and should be continued during&#13;
the entire operation period of the treatment systems. Guidelines for such monitoring are included in&#13;
Table 2 at the end of this annex.&#13;
64.   Creek water quality monitoring along with observations on hydrodynamic parameters should&#13;
be initiated by Government of Maharashtra to support the development of a comprehensive water&#13;

quality model for the entire Thane Creek. This is a prerequisite for preparing the recommended&#13;
overall wastewater management plan (see para. 57). The objective should be the determination of&#13;
location-specific effluent limits for the various industrial and municipal discharges to ensure that the&#13;
pollution load to the creek does not exceed its assimilative capacity. The water quality monitoring&#13;
should be supplemented by limited biological surveys to document improvements in the creek&#13;
ecosystem as a result of wastewater treatment.&#13;
Assessment of Environmental Management Capacity and Needs for Strengthening&#13;
65.    There is a need for substantial institutional development within the MCGB for effective&#13;
operation of marine outfalls and aerated lagoons. Training programs should be conducted for staff at&#13;
various levels, from managers to operators and maintenance technicians, to ensure that the capacity&#13;
for routine operation and maintenance functions exists. For certain non-routine functions, such as the&#13;
use of water quality models for effective water quality monitoring, the evaluation of long-term&#13;
environmental impacts of the project, and the conduct of wastewater management planning for future&#13;
discharges, MCGB should draw on specialized institutions in the metropolitan area to supplement its&#13;
own capabilities.&#13;
66.    For effective implementation of the recommended environmental monitoring, it will be&#13;
necessary to develop adequate facilities for sampling and analysis. One alternative is for MCGB to&#13;
create an environmental monitoring cell, with adequate training and instrumentation for coastal water&#13;
quality monitoring and analysis related to the outfall project. Government and private laboratories&#13;
with adequate facilities and expertise may also be identified to assist in these activities or to perform&#13;
them under contract to MCGB.&#13;
Revisions to the Environmental Assessment as a Result of Appraisal&#13;
67.    No revisions were made to the EA reports themselves as a result of appraisal. However, a&#13;
number of additions and modifications to the mitigation and monitoring plans were determined to be&#13;
necessary. The mission and MCGB discussed MCGBs present capacity for mitigation and&#13;
monitoring plan implementation. Institutional arrangements for implementation were agreed on and&#13;
elaborated. The results of these discussions are presented below. They should be treated as&#13;
amendments and additions to the mitigation and monitoring plans presented in the EA reports and&#13;
summarized in Tables 1 and 2 in this annex.&#13;
Modifications to Mitigation and Monitoring Plans&#13;
68.    The mission reviewed arrangements for implementation of the Environmental Mitigation and&#13;
Monitoring Plans contained in the Environmental Assessment and determined that they are adequate.&#13;
With one exception (see para. 69), recommended measures to control construction-related impacts and&#13;
protect worker safety that are the contractors responsibility have been incorporated specifically into&#13;
contract documents for the outfalls and are being included in documents for the lagoons. Their&#13;
enforcement will be the responsibility of the Resident Engineer (RE) assigned to each site by Binnie&#13;
&amp; Partners (B&amp;P, engineer on the contract), who will in turn train and supervise the MCGB&#13;
construction supervisors. The RE will also be responsible for monitoring spoil disposal, site&#13;
sanitation, dust, traffic, etc. A specialized subconsultant will be employed to monitor blasting&#13;
operations, and MCGBs existing environmental unit, which has the appropriate staff and equipment,&#13;
will monitor noise levels and water and air quality. The telephone number of each sites construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

office will be publicized in adjacent communities, and the RE will be responsible for responding to&#13;
citizen questions or complaints.&#13;
69.   The EA recommended maximum safe charge limits to ensure safety of nearby structures&#13;
during blasting operations for the marine outfalls. The design engineers have modified this mitigation&#13;
measure slightly, by requiring instead that the contractor conduct a trial blast to determine the&#13;
permissible size of charges. The outfall contract documents also contain a number of other measures&#13;
to manage the impacts of blasting that are not included in the EA.&#13;
70.   Although the EA addressed potential impacts of operations at borrow areas or quarries from&#13;
which the material for construction of the lagoons would be obtained, the Environmental Mitigation&#13;
Plan did not inititally include corresponding mitigation measures. This has been remedied in&#13;
Addendum 1 to the contract documents for the lagoons, which requires the contractor to prepare and&#13;
present to B&amp;P an environmental assessment and environmental management plan for location and&#13;
operation of borrow areas and quarries and for transportation of excavated materials.&#13;
71.   Contract documents for both the outfalls and the aerated lagoons contain provisions for the&#13;
protection of worker health and safety that are considerably more extensive than those in the&#13;
Environmental Mitigation Plan and are considered adequate.&#13;
72.   Measures to mitigate impacts during operation are synonymous with good plant operating&#13;
practice and process monitoring. The operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) consultant being retained&#13;
by MCGB will develop operating manuals, define staffing needs, design and conduct training, and&#13;
develop specifications for laboratories and equipment. B&amp;P intends to retain Sydney Water Board as&#13;
advisors on outfall operation and monitoring during the 12-month commissioning period.&#13;
73.   MCGB will contract with NEERI to carry out baseline chemical and biological water quality&#13;
surveys before commissioning of the outfalls and lagoons and periodic monitoring of ambient&#13;
conditions once they are in operation. During appraisal, it was agreed that the commencement of the&#13;
baseline monitoring should be deferred until one year before the related facilities are commissioned.&#13;
Given the present degraded conditions in the receiving waters, it is not likely that the baseline&#13;
conditions will change significantly over the next few years from those documented in the EA, and&#13;
annual sampling would therefore not add enough useful information to the database to justify the cost.&#13;
74.   The matter of compensation for unavoidable loss of mangroves will be by means of&#13;
replanting approximately 200 ha of suitable mangrove habitat along Thane Creek. It is intended that&#13;
the actual location will be decided with GOM Forests Department, which will also be asked to&#13;
oversee the implementation, with funding from MCGB.&#13;
75.   A substantial amount of the public information and consultation activity for this project was&#13;
conducted after the EA was completed and is therefore not documented in the EA reports. Indeed the&#13;
consultation program was ongoing at the time of appraisal. All information and consultation activities&#13;
during and after EA preparation are described in the next section of this annex.&#13;

Public Information and Consultation&#13;
Surveys of Communities Near Worli and Bandra&#13;
76.   During EA preparation, NEERI conducted surveys in the neighborhoods adjacent to the&#13;
planned outfall construction sites at Worli and Bandra, using questionnaires and personal interviews.&#13;
The surveys encompassed on-site environmental conditions, general community structure and&#13;
dominant occupations, environmental problems identified by residents, sensitive issues, and awareness&#13;
of and opinion about the proposed project.&#13;
77.   At Bandra, the settlement on Mahim Bay near the pumping station has approximately 35&#13;
pucca dwellings and 500 huts, with a population of 5,000, mostly fishermen. It is a community with&#13;
few amenities. Residents complain of persistent odors causing discomfort and even nausea, and they&#13;
attribute them to sewage. The fish catch at Mahim Bay has dwindled in the past 10 years, a trend&#13;
that the fishermen also attribute to sewage. There was little awareness of MCGBs plans to construct&#13;
an outfall, but fishermen recalled the earlier project and expressed concern about laying of pipeline.&#13;
They felt that their opinion should be sought, as incorrect laying of the pipeline could interfere with&#13;
fishing activities.&#13;
78.   At Worli, there are two communities, one on each side of the drain that discharges sewage.&#13;
One, MCGB Quarters, houses mostly municipal employees, and the other is a poor fishing village of&#13;
kutcha houses called Worli Village. Residents of MCGB Quarters recalled inconvenience, discomfort&#13;
and damage caused by noise, dust and vibrations from blasting for the previous outfall project, some&#13;
of which was conducted at odd hours like 6:00 AM and midnight. They suggested that blasting be&#13;
limited to the time between noon and 3:00 PM. They also complained of foul-smelling seawater&#13;
backing up through drains into their homes at high tide. Worli Village dwellers complained of&#13;
persistent odor, more predominant during the monsoon, which caused headaches and nausea. They&#13;
were generally unaware of the proposed project.&#13;
Beach User Surveys&#13;
79.   NEERI interviewed beach users at random at the three important beaches in Bombay, which&#13;
are important open-space resources heavily used by city residents for walking, picnics, and other&#13;
forms of recreation. At Juhu, a "suburban" beach, 80 percent of respondents were Bombay residents&#13;
who stated that they visit the beach regularly. While 70 percent expressed their preference for this&#13;
beach, 60 percent felt that it is degraded by litter, sewage, proliferation of hawkers, and accumulation&#13;
of animal dung. Only 22 percent were aware of the proposed project, and they believed it would&#13;
benefit the beach environment in general.&#13;
80.   Dadar Beach is located in a densely populated residential section of the city, where it is the&#13;
main open space area. Unlike Juhu, it experiences direct effects of wastewater from the Bandra&#13;
service zone. Here, 92 percent of the respondents were Bombay citizens, and 60 percent felt the&#13;
beach environment to be generally good as a recreation site. However, 75 percent thought the beach&#13;
to be "dirty" as a result of sewage and litter. Awareness of the proposed project was much higher (50&#13;
percent), probably since the Bandra site is visible from Dadar. Only 20 percent were expecting a&#13;
positive result for beach aesthetics and water quality; 70 percent had no opinion. It was a generally&#13;
expressed view that MCGB should improve the beach quality for all taxpayers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 16 of 22&#13;
81.   Chowpati Beach is in the heart of the city, near residential and commercial areas. It has a&#13;
large number of food stalls and small shops, which have contributed to unsightly and unhygienic&#13;
conditions. Sewage discharges at the waters edge at one end of the beach. Nearly all respondents&#13;
described the beach as a "good environment", yet 70 percent also considered it dirty. Its popularity&#13;
may be because of its location and traditionally heavy use.&#13;
Public Information Activities&#13;
82.   MCGB has prepared an eight-page color brochure outlining the history of the Bombay Sewage&#13;
Disposal Project and describing the salient features of the marine outfalls. It is published in two&#13;
versions, English and Marathi. The brochures have been handed out at consultation meetings and, in&#13;
June 1994, they were distributed in quantity to 23 local ward offices. Newspaper advertisements&#13;
invited any interested citizen to obtain a copy from the ward office and to submit written comments to&#13;
MCGB. The brochure was also directly mailed in June to about 30 citizens who have been actively&#13;
involved with environmental concerns in Bombay, with an invitation to send comments in writing. At&#13;
last count, more than 70 letters had been received in response to the brochure, and all were answered&#13;
personally by the Additional Municipal Commissioner responsible for the project. Nearly all of the&#13;
letters expressed strong support for the project, and many offered constructive suggestions. A second&#13;
brochure is in preparation to inform the public about the aerated lagoons at Bhandup and Ghatkopar,&#13;
the Low Cost Sanitation component, and MCGBs program to evaluate the condition of the collector&#13;
system and repair dilapidated sewers.&#13;
83.    MCGB officials have given interviews to reporters from The Times of India, The Metropolis,&#13;
Indian Express, and several Marathi language papers. These interviews have prompted a number of&#13;
articles about the project.&#13;
84.   The full Environmental Assessment Reports and Executive Summaries for the outfalls and the&#13;
Bhandup and Ghatkopar aerated lagoons have been made available for public inspection. Newspaper&#13;
advertisements were published on February 6, 1995, informing the public of the three MCGB offices&#13;
where the reports are located.&#13;
Public Consultation Activities&#13;
85.   A meeting of representatives of environmental NGOs and eminent citizens interested in the&#13;
future of Bombayg environment (including several retired GOM and MCGB senior officials) was&#13;
chaired by the Additional Municipal Commissioner on April 7, 1994. MCGB made a slide&#13;
presentation of the project, which was followed by a question and answer session. Participants raised&#13;
a number of significant points.&#13;
(a)    They emphasized the need for solutions for sanitation and wastewater disposal in the&#13;
slums, which are not served by sewers, both to improve conditions in those&#13;
communities and reduce the amount of untreated wastewater that will still find its way&#13;
to the nearshore waters after the outfalls are in operation.&#13;
(b)    They pointed out that dry-weather discharges of sanitary sewage from storm drains&#13;
cause local degradation of water quality at many locations in Bombay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
ANNEX 1 1&#13;
Page 17 of 22&#13;
(c)    They suggested that MCGB establish a committee of affected citizens to monitor the&#13;
progress of the outfalls project and advise MCGB on problems, such as noise and&#13;
vibration.&#13;
MCGB accepted all of these suggestions. A program to abate dry-weather storm drain flows has been&#13;
initiated and MCGB has proposed including a Low Cost Sanitation component in the project that&#13;
would provide facilities for approximately I million slum dwellers in 10 different areas. A Citizens&#13;
Advisory Committee will be constituted before construction begins. It is worth noting that members&#13;
of the MOEF Expert Panel assigned to review the environmental clearance application for the project&#13;
attended this meeting. They recommended that implementation of programs to address points (a) and&#13;
(b) above be made conditions of the clearance, and MOEF has written those requirements into the&#13;
clearance letter.&#13;
86.   A second meeting was held on April 29, 1994, chaired by the Mayor of Bombay and attended&#13;
by leaders of various political parties and members of the press. The Additional Municipal&#13;
Commissioner again presented the marine outfalls project, and a brief note entitled "Environmental&#13;
Assessment for Proposed Marine Outfalls at Worli and Bandra" was distributed to the participants.&#13;
87.   MCGB has begun holding meetings in communities most directly affected by the project. On&#13;
November 13, 1994, MCGB officials and NEERI met with Carter Road Pali Hill Residents'&#13;
Association and Bandra Reclamation HIG Residents' Association. Both groups were interested in&#13;
getting a clear explanation of the proposed project and the nature and scale of problems likely to arise&#13;
during the construction of the Bandra outfall. They were also concerned about the provisions for&#13;
disposal of tunneling spoil, the amount of land that would be filled by it, and the plans for final&#13;
grading of the disposal site. At the end of the meeting, participants expressed support for MCGBs&#13;
efforts to improve the environment.&#13;
Planned Consultation Activities&#13;
88.   MCGB will continue meeting with interested groups regarding the outfalls and will extend the&#13;
consultations to cover the aerated lagoons. MCGB is also committed to establishing the Citizens&#13;
Advisory Committee. In addition, more intensive consultations are planned to address the concerns of&#13;
fishermens communities and to develop the Low Cost Sanitation component.&#13;
89.   MCGB has awarded a contract to Vasundhara Project, a wing of Nirmal Niketan (a well-&#13;
known local NGO concerned with social issues) to carry out a socio-economic survey of the fishing&#13;
communities and to obtain a more complete picture of their perceptions of and concerns about the&#13;
project. During the work, Nirmal Niketan will fully inform the communities about the features of the&#13;
outfalls and facilitate dialogue between community representatives and MCGB.&#13;
90.   MCGB has selected a local environmental consultant teamed with local NGOs to conduct the&#13;
survey of slum neighborhoods in the course of planning and design of the Low Cost Sanitation&#13;
component. The approach to providing each community with sanitation facilities will be developed in&#13;
concert with community representatives. Depending on their preferences for method of&#13;
implementation, communities may assume responsibility for any or all of construction, operation,&#13;
maintenance and ownership of the facilities.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
BOMBAY SEWAGE DISPOSAL PROJECT&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED AND THEIR APPLICATION&#13;
1.    This Annex reviews the main lessons of experience and describes how these have been applied&#13;
in the proposed Project. For convenience of reference, the full text of the Evaluation Summary (ES)&#13;
from OED's PPAR '/ for the Second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project (BWSSP II -&#13;
Cr 842-IN) is included here on pages 4 to 11 of this Annex. Numbers in parentheses refer to the&#13;
paragraph numbers in the ES.&#13;
2.    In particular, sewerage investments planned under BWSSP II were proposed but postponed&#13;
from the First Project (Cr 390-IN)(10) which was the first Bank-supported project in India in the&#13;
water supply sanitation sector. A BWSSP III is in implementation. The total value of these three&#13;
projects is about US$1,180 million and the total value of Bank support is about US$436 million.&#13;
Under BWSSP II the works comprised extending a collector network to virtually the entire Greater&#13;
Bombay, rehabilitation of existing and construction of new pumping stations, two major and one&#13;
minor sea outfalls and, in the inland areas, aerated lagoon treatment plants (11).&#13;
3.    The Audit finds that:&#13;
(a)   the final design should have been completed before appraisal (13);&#13;
(b)   the Bank should have employed expert services to oversee the preparation of the outfalls (14);&#13;
(c)   the implementation of the sewerage component was little short of a disaster" (16);&#13;
(d)   costs exceeded appraisal estimates by a factor of about three (16);&#13;
(e)   there were serious design errors and incompetence in procurement (16);&#13;
(f)   Bank supervision of the sewerage components while intensive, lacked sufficient expertise and&#13;
decisiveness (17);&#13;
(g)   by far the most serious issue is the submarine outfalls; contracts were not awarded until one&#13;
year after the original closing date; serious design problems were alleged; the&#13;
contractor abandoned the work and took legal action against the Bombay Municipal&#13;
Corporation (BMC) (18);&#13;
(h)   the Consultant's on the sewerage component were eventually dismissed (23); they had only an&#13;
advisory role in construction supervision (23);&#13;
(i)   BMC appointed another consultant to report on remedial actions who recommended calling&#13;
for bids for alternative outfall designs and redesign and remedial actions for the main&#13;
pumping stations (19);&#13;
(j)   the absence of the outfalls and the delays in the construction of the aerated lagoons (all&#13;
included in the proposed BSDP) is creating unacceptable environmental pollution and&#13;
health hazards (20);&#13;
(k)   procurement problems and delays were a prominent feature of BWSSP I but they scaled new&#13;
heights under BWSSP II (22); most of the procurement problems occurred on the&#13;
sewerage components (22); the Bank would have been prudent to utilize a&#13;
procurement expert (22);&#13;

(1)   virtually all of the major components of the sewerage works, which were only partially&#13;
complete, show a very low standard of workmanship; the lack of prequalification,&#13;
inadequate supervision and the failure to apply of contractual remedies are identified&#13;
as reasons (24);&#13;
(m)  BMC lacked a capacity for decision-making at the highest levels (25) BUT the exceptionally&#13;
candid Part 11 of the Project Completion Report, prepared by BMC, is a highly&#13;
encouraging sign of the recognition of the problem by BMC (25);&#13;
(m)  good financial performance partly accounted for by construction delays (28);&#13;
(n)   future Bank assistance for completion of the delayed work and future development is still&#13;
needed and expected, but, if granted, it must be on the basis of the utmost&#13;
professionalism (particularly in the technical areas) without fear or favor (31);&#13;
(o)   the size and technical complexity of the project demanded a higher level and more extensive&#13;
supervisory input that the Bank, and BMC, had allocated; the results were disastrous&#13;
for the sewerage works resulting in financial losses, delayed benefits and&#13;
environmental damage (33).&#13;
4.    In response to the above, in the proposed BSDP:&#13;
(i) Preparation - Procurement - Cost Estimation [3(a), (d), (e), (g), (j) and (1) above]. The&#13;
completion of final designs, prepared by the consultants noted in (h) and bid documents using&#13;
the Bank's standard bidding documents have been completed for the two outfalls, the two&#13;
aerated lagoons and the Bandra pumping station; additionally bids have been received and&#13;
evaluated for the outfalls (the bidding resulted in prices close to pre-bid cost estimates) and&#13;
have been invited for the two aerated lagoons; in all these cases, the bid invitation of from&#13;
pre-qualified contractors. These actions reflect conditions for negotiations.&#13;
(ii) Special Outfall Expertise [3(b' abovel. Two individual experts in geology and tunnel&#13;
construction and experts from the Water Board of Sydney, Australia (having recent related&#13;
experience) were employed to review the preparation of the design and bid documents in the&#13;
context of the results more detailed geological/geotechnical investigations and data.&#13;
(iii)  Consultants and Supervision [3(c). (h). (k) abovel. The consultants noted in 3(h) above have&#13;
continued to provide survey, investigation, design, bid document preparation and evaluation&#13;
services for the two outfalls for the two aerated lagoons, and for the Bandra pumping station.&#13;
The same consultant, with the full authority of "the Engineer" is appointed to supervise all&#13;
procurement and construction related to the two outfalls, the Bandra pumping station and the&#13;
Ghatkopar influent tunnel; other (local) consultants will be appointed to supervise&#13;
construction of the two aerated lagoons, the structural improvements to five pumping stations&#13;
and the conveyance system improvements.&#13;
(iv) Bank Supervision [3(f) and (o)1. See Annex 8.&#13;
(v)  MCGB's (was BMC Organization - Management - Procedures r3(m) abovel. MCGB and the&#13;
sewerage part of its Water Supply and Sewerage Department (WSSD) is now under more able&#13;
management. Relations between this staff and the current main consultant are good. MCGB&#13;
has revised its procedures such that the Standing Commnittee approval of a staff/consultant&#13;
recommendation on contract awards is deemed to be givgn in the absence of a contrary&#13;
decision within 15 days.&#13;

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT FOR BOMBAY WATER SUPPLY-SEWERAGE II&#13;
(Report No 9265 - December 31, 1990)&#13;
EVALUATION SUMMARY&#13;
PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT&#13;
INDIA&#13;
SECOND BOMBAY WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 842-IN)&#13;
EVALUATION SUMMARY&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    In India,  the provision  of water  supply  and waste  disposal  is  the&#13;
responsibility of the respective states which, normally, exercise these functions&#13;
through various government departments and agencies.  However, in the case of&#13;
most large cities, the full responsibility is delegated to the municipal&#13;
authority.&#13;
2.    From independence to the late 1970s,  competing demands  for resources&#13;
restricted sector investments to 1% to 2% of total public expenditures with the&#13;
consequence that. according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) 1975 "Mid&#13;
Decade Review," in India, only 31% of the population had access to safe wacer&#13;
supply and only 20% had acceptable wasce disposal facilities. These figures were&#13;
lower than the average for all developing countries (PPAR. paras. I and 2).&#13;
3.    The project under review was designed to serve the Greater Bombay area..&#13;
Bombay. the second largest city of India and the capital of the State of&#13;
Maharastra. had an estimated 1977 population of 7.6 million. Lack of adequate&#13;
investments and general neglect resulted in deplorable water and sewerage&#13;
services in the city and not until the mid 1960s was there a serious attempt to&#13;
develop comprehensive, long range, sector developmene plans for improving the&#13;
situation at which time the Government of India (GOI) requesred the Bank to&#13;
assist Bombay in the financing of water supply improvements (PPAR. paras. 3, 4.&#13;
and 5).&#13;
4.    Following an extensive preparation period, the First Bombay Water Supply&#13;
and Sewerage Project was appraised in 1972 and IDA Credit 390-IN. for US$55.0&#13;
million was approved on May 15. 1973. The project, forming the first stage of&#13;
a long range water supply and sewerage development program, consisted of the&#13;
provision of additional water supply source capacities. treatment for all water&#13;
supplies  for  the city and  transmission  and  distribution  improvements  and&#13;
extensions. On the waste disposal side extensive additional sewer network and&#13;
new pumping and treatment/disposal facilities were to be provided. The project&#13;
also provided for institutional improvements for the municipality's Water Supply&#13;
and Sewerage Department (WSSD).&#13;
5.    The project encountered severe implemencation problems.  The consequent&#13;
delays and the projected large cost overrun (140%) resulting from the re-&#13;
estimation of costs on completion of the final designs. necessitated a&#13;
restructuring, under which the majority of the proposed sewerage investments were&#13;
postponed. The revised project was completed with a 2-1/2 years delay with the&#13;
Credic being closed on June 30. 1981. Even wich the postponement of the sewerage&#13;

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT FOR BOMBAY WATER SUPPLY-SEWERAGE II&#13;
(Report No 9265 - December 31, 1990)&#13;
EVALUATION SUMMARY&#13;
investmencs the revised, final. cost of the project was US$250.8 million. 58%&#13;
over the appraisal estimate of US$158.2 million equivalent. This was largely due&#13;
to: (i) low initial cost estimates; (ii) changes resulting from final design and&#13;
(iii) cost escalation over the construction period. The most successful element&#13;
of the project was the institutional improvement of WSSD and, in particular, its&#13;
excellent financial performance. The project was subjected to a full evaluation&#13;
by OED and Project Performance Audit report No. 5875 recorded the project&#13;
experience (PPAR. paras. 5-7).&#13;
The Project and Its Objectives&#13;
6.    The objectives of the Second Project were identical to the objectives of&#13;
the Fist project and, indeed, the entire program namely the progressive&#13;
improvement and extension of Bombay's water supply and sewerage services and to&#13;
develop an efficient and financially self supporting wacer/sewerage entity.&#13;
7.    The more  specific objectives for the water supply services, however, did&#13;
not include targets for the achieving of a continuous. 24-hour, supply.  The&#13;
immediate and long range targets only specified construction of incremental&#13;
source,  production,  transmission  and  distribution  facilities  and  limited&#13;
improvements  in  the  hours  of  supply  were  projected.    Because  of  this&#13;
lincremental" approach no detailed demand forecasts were made and the entire long&#13;
range planning process lacked an ultimate target on which rational staging of the&#13;
long range program could be based.&#13;
8.    The Audit had extensive discussions with WSSD and the consultants and urged.&#13;
the development of specific plans for the provision of 24-hour water supply for&#13;
the entire Bombay.  The present system. in effect, does provide such service for&#13;
those who can afford in-house storage but subjects low income consumers to an&#13;
unsatisfactory service and the whole of Bombay to the danger of contaminated&#13;
water supply due to the repeated de-pressurization of the pipe network.  In the&#13;
Audit's estimate, the provision of 24-hour supply is not out of reach.&#13;
technically or financially (PPAR. paras. 10-13).&#13;
9.    The water supply components of the project, as designed. consisted of the&#13;
construction of intake. treatment and transmission facilities for an additional&#13;
capacity of 450 mld, pumping, storage and distribution improvements, meter&#13;
replacement and repair program and equipment for the control of Unaccounted for&#13;
Water (UFU).   The total estimated cost of the water supply components was&#13;
US$114.5 million equivalent (PPAR, para. 14).&#13;
10.   In terms of quality and coverage of service, the sewage collection and&#13;
disposal was far below that of the water supply.   Only about 44X of Greater&#13;
Bombay   was   connecced   to  sewers   and   there   was   no   environmentally&#13;
acceptable-disposal  system.   The housing densities and the soil conditions&#13;
coupled with high water tables do not permit the use of alternative waste&#13;
disposal methods (pic latrines etc.).&#13;
11.   The sewerage works proposed but postponed under the First project were,&#13;
with substantial additions, included in the Second Project. These comprised of&#13;
extending the collector network to virtually the entire Greater Bombay.&#13;
rehabilitation of existing and construction of new puAping stations. two major&#13;

and one minor sea outfalls and. in the inland areas, aerated lagoon treatment&#13;
plants. The estimated cost of these facilities was US$94.0 million equivalenc.&#13;
12.   The provision of stores, vehicles, engineering services and contingencies&#13;
and training added another US$203.1 million, raising the total estimated cost of&#13;
the project to US$411.6 million or. in local currency, Rs 3,540 million (PPAR,&#13;
paras. 14-17).&#13;
Proiect Pregaration&#13;
13.   The appraisal of che project was based on preliminary design and final&#13;
engineering design was to be carried out during implementation by consultants to&#13;
be appointed as a condition of effectiveness. In the Audit's view, not having&#13;
final design at appraisal was a serious omission in view of the size and&#13;
complexity of the project. Procurement problems, familiar from the First project&#13;
which were not expeceed to reoccur but did, delayed the appointment of&#13;
consultants by 18 months, creating a corresponding delay in effectiveness and&#13;
start up and 2-1/2 years after Board approval only 3% of the credit was&#13;
disbursed. Furthermore serious design errors which subsequently delayed the&#13;
sewerage works might have been uncovered early had the designs been available at&#13;
appraisal.&#13;
14.   Apart from the delay of final design, project preparation was generally&#13;
efficient and appeared to augur well for future progress. Unfortunately this was&#13;
to be a false hope. Bank resources for the preparation were generally adequate&#13;
with the notable exception of not providing special expert services to oversee.&#13;
the preparation for the submarine sewer outfalls.  The required expertise to&#13;
handle these relatively rare and technically complex structures was clearly not&#13;
available in the Bank (PPAR, paras. 17-20).&#13;
lmDlementation&#13;
15.   Project implementation became a long and arduous process. The water supply&#13;
facilities started production in 1986 but a number of major components, including&#13;
a critical Master Balancing Reservoir will not be completed until mid/late 1990&#13;
with complecion costs financed from WSSD resources. However, emergency solutions&#13;
devised permit 90% utilization of the additional capacities.   The completed&#13;
componencs  show good quality  construction and efficient  operations.   The&#13;
relacively trouble free implementation of the water supply components and the,&#13;
apparently, consistently satisfactory financial performance of WSSD seem to have&#13;
resulted in relatively perfunctory Bank supervision in these areas, however.&#13;
without adverse effects (PPAR, paras. 21 and 23).&#13;
16.   By contrast, the implementation of the sewerage components was little short&#13;
of disaster and dealing with this, together with the exceptionally troublesome&#13;
procurement process, dominated Bank supervision throughout the project's life&#13;
(see also par&amp;. 22).  Although the sewage collector network was essentially&#13;
completed as planned, none of the major pumping stations (the largest ever built&#13;
in Asia) or the treatment/disposal facilities have, as yet, been completed.&#13;
Currene estimates put the completion of these works at 1994-1995, at the&#13;
earliest, and at a cost exceeding appraisal estimates by about the factor of&#13;
three.  This situation was brought about by a combina ion of factors, including&#13;

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT FOR BOMBAY WATER SUPPLY-SEWERAGE II&#13;
(Report No 9265 - December 31, 1990)&#13;
EVALUATION SUMMARY&#13;
incompetent management. serious design errors and incompetence in procuremene.&#13;
material shortages and appointmene of unqualified contractors (PPAR. para. 22).&#13;
17.   Bank supervision of  the sewerage components  while  intensive,  lacked&#13;
sufficient expertise and decisiveness.   Only a late 1989 supervision report&#13;
revealed the disastrous situation in full. The Audit has confirmed the complete&#13;
validity  of  this  report,  including  the  exceptionally  poor  construction&#13;
workmanship, partially completed structures abandoned by contractors three years&#13;
ago and expensive electrical and mechanical equipment which, stored on site&#13;
without protection, deteriorated to the point of uselessness.  It is essential&#13;
that the findings of the 1989 supervision report and of the Audit be adequately&#13;
considered in the Third Project which  is funding the completion of these&#13;
components (PPAR. para. 24 and 25).&#13;
18.   Of the wide spread problems of the sewerage components by far the most&#13;
serious is the issue of the two main submarine outfalls which were to discharge&#13;
the major proportion (60X) of Bombay's sewage into the Bay of Bombay. The award&#13;
of this large contract -- two outfalls, each 3,000 meters long and 3.5 m diameter&#13;
- took over two years (1982-84) and the first pipes were not laid until February&#13;
1986, one year after the original closing date of the credit.   Subsequent&#13;
discovery of serious design problems. followed by the inability/unwillingness of&#13;
the contractor to proceed, resulted in the dismissal of the consultants, the&#13;
eventual abandoning of the works by the contractor and the latter taking legal&#13;
action against BMC for substantial damages.&#13;
19.   WSSD appointed another consultant in January 1988 to report on the remedial.&#13;
actions required on the sewerage works. The consultant submitted his report in&#13;
November 1989 recommending the calling of bids for alternative design solutions&#13;
for the outfalls and redesign and remedial actions for the main pumping stations.&#13;
TSSD is in the process of considering che report and has approached the Bank for&#13;
financial assistance for the design and construction costs.&#13;
20.   In the absence of the sea outfall disposal system and the delay in the&#13;
construction of the aeraced lagoons, the completed collector system discharges&#13;
raw sewage at various points into inland waterways and the sea creating&#13;
unacceptable environmental pollution and health hazards, essentially negating the&#13;
projected health benefits of che project.  An additional environmental issue&#13;
arising is that the original design of the outfalls envisaged the construction&#13;
of pretreatment and disinfection facilities at each outfall.   Recent reviews&#13;
confirmed that these facilities can not be built due to lack of available land&#13;
and the potential nuisance effect of suich p-lants in the heart of Bombay. As the&#13;
shallow depth of the offshore waters will not permit adequate dilution of raw&#13;
sewage at the 3.000 m distance from the shore, the probable solution is likely&#13;
to be the extension of the outfalls to a length of some 8,000 meters (PPAR,&#13;
paras. 25-27).&#13;
21.   The necessary changes in the project which emerged at final design,&#13;
together with che accumulated delays and high inflation escalated the project&#13;
costs. Estimates in 1983 indicated a potential final cost of Rs 7.594 million&#13;
compared to appraisal (1978) estimates of Rs 3.540 million.  As no financing&#13;
provisions could be made for the additional cost, the project was revised to a&#13;
target cost of Rs 6,556 million and some components were postponed to a third&#13;

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT FOR BOMBAY WATER SUPPLY-SEWERAGE II&#13;
(Report No 9265 - December 31, 1990)&#13;
EVALUATION SUMMARY&#13;
project (already in preparation at the time) with an estimated cost of Rs 6.100&#13;
million. This project is now under way with Bank financing under Ln. 2769 of&#13;
US$40.0 million and IDA Credit 1750 of US$145 million (PPAR. para. 28).&#13;
Procurement&#13;
22.   Procurement problems and delays were a prominent feature of the First&#13;
project but they scaled new heights under the second project.  File references&#13;
to poor bid documencation, design errors, alleged political interference and&#13;
collusion. unfair evaluations. all were present.'  These resulted in delays,&#13;
frequent rebidding of contracts and persistent complaints by bidders.  Dealing&#13;
with these problems occupied an unreasonable proportion of the time of Bank&#13;
supervisory staff as well as forming the bulk of the project correspondence. It&#13;
is noteworthy that the majority of the procurement problems occurred on the&#13;
sewerage components. a further indication of the poor management of this part of&#13;
the project. While the Bank was diligent in pursuing the procurement problems&#13;
it has never taken a strong stand to stem the tide and, considering the size and&#13;
complexity of the project (some 92 major contracts were awarded) it would have&#13;
been prudent to utilize a procurement expert which would have permitted the&#13;
supervision staff to concentrate efforts on the technical problems of the project&#13;
and would have also reduced the problem of imperfect bid documents (PPAR, paras.&#13;
29-32).&#13;
Performance of Consultants and Contractors&#13;
23.   The consultants for the water supply components, an Indian and foreign,&#13;
joint venture (under the First project the foreign consultant led, in the Second&#13;
the roles were reversed) performed to full satisfaction.   The Audit's only&#13;
criticism is the lack of proposals to provide 24-hour supply for Bombay.  The&#13;
consultants, again a foreign/Indian joint venture, on the sewerage works did not&#13;
perform well and were, eventually, dismissed. In fairness, the Audit notes that&#13;
the foreign consultant encountered difficult and hostile relationship wich some&#13;
WSSD scaff and had only advisory role in construccion supervision. While chis&#13;
may limit his responsibility for the poor workmanship noted, in no way does it&#13;
excuse the major design errors, considering its international reputation. Other&#13;
consultants providing financial and managemenc system assistance performed&#13;
sacisfactorily (PPAR. paras. 33-35).&#13;
24.   The performance  of construction contractors  and equipment  suppliers&#13;
presencs  a very mixed record.   Some of the water supply facilities  were&#13;
constructed to high standard and, apparently, efficiently while a few are scill&#13;
far from finished with no work in progress. On the sewerage side virtually all&#13;
the major components, which are only partially complete, show very low standard&#13;
of workmanship and some are essencially abandoned by the contractor. The Audic&#13;
concluded that lack of pre-qualification. inadequate supervision and WSSD's&#13;
inability or unwillingness to apply concraccual remedies resulted in the massive&#13;
Government comments express reservations on these matters.   The&#13;
Audit considers that the magnitude of the problems warrant the&#13;
highlighting of the issues recorded on the files.&#13;

EVALUATION SUMMARY&#13;
loss of resources in chese works. On the incomplete sewer oucfalls the foreign&#13;
concractor. of good repute, started well but soon ran into major problems and,&#13;
eventually, abandoned the works. The untenable relationship that has developed&#13;
among the contractor. consultanc and WSSD staff undoubcedly contributed to the&#13;
problems (PPAR. paras. 36 and 37).&#13;
Institutional Development &amp; Operations&#13;
25.   Under both the First and the Second projects Bank reports gave high marks&#13;
for the institutional development of WSSD.- The availability of skilled manpower.&#13;
sound training program and its relatively affluent status certainly raised WSSD&#13;
well above the average Indian and. indeed. other developing country institutions&#13;
of similar nature.  However. the generally high level of technical competence&#13;
(verified by the Audit) existing makes it all the more difficult to understand&#13;
the utter failure to manage the sewerage investments. The often quoted 'lack of&#13;
familiarity with sewerage works" can not be accepted as an excuse, considering&#13;
tha vast amount of accumulated technical experience in the Corporation. In the&#13;
Audit's view the principal problems were the lack of decision making at the&#13;
highest levels and a peculiar. traditional, promotion system which. in most&#13;
senior positions, often prevents the appointment of "the best man" for the job.&#13;
The political sensitivity of senior staff and outside interference seems to&#13;
accounc for the appalling procurement process. The exceptionally candid Part II&#13;
of the PCR. produced by the borrower, is a highly encouraging sign of the&#13;
recognition of the problems by BMC.&#13;
26.   Tha operation and maintenance of the major water supply facilities visited.&#13;
by the Audit were satisfactory by any standard. Maintenance of the distribution&#13;
facilities were more difficult to judge. The complex process of manipulating the&#13;
intermittent supply system is, for the time being. satisfactory but likely to&#13;
become unmanageable in the future because the increasing precision required to&#13;
direcc the flows into different parts of the city.  Since most of the sewerage&#13;
facilities are incomplete, the Audit had no means of forming a judgement on&#13;
sewerage operations (PPAR, paras. 38-40).&#13;
Financial Asoects&#13;
27.   With the current level and structure of the combined water/sewerage charges&#13;
and water/sewerage taxes the revenue generation of WSSD is highly satisfactory.&#13;
For the past several years, total revenues exceeded total direct expenditures 2-&#13;
1/2 to 3 cimes.  Actual contribution to investment from incernally generaced&#13;
sources have. consistencly, exceeded the 40X covenanced in the Credit Agreements&#13;
and BMC has been able to cover the substantial cosc overruns which characterized&#13;
all its projects.&#13;
28. Nevertheless che WSSD has serious emerging problems, the principal among&#13;
them is the steadily increasing accounts receivable which, in 1989, reached&#13;
nearly 69%. Of the total. outstanding. arrears of Rs 1.356 million nearly one&#13;
fifth is over three years old. mostly due from government and industrial&#13;
organizations.   At the same time. provisions for bad debts is a mere Rs 51&#13;
million and no debts have ever been written off. The Credit covenants require&#13;
no more than 20% accounts receivable. The resulting reduced liquidity has been&#13;

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT FOR BOMBAY WATER SUPPLY-SEWERAGE II&#13;
(Report No 9265 - December 31, 1990)&#13;
EVALUATION SUMMARY&#13;
largely  compensated  by  substancially  reduced ;annual  capital  investment&#13;
requirements due to the excensive delays in construction.&#13;
29.    The 1988/89 audit report on WSSD's accounts, although only marginally&#13;
qualified. severely criticized several aspects of the financial management, among&#13;
them the particularly poor performance of the metering/meter repair process which&#13;
has resulted in reduced water revenues despite substantially increased supplies.&#13;
Another worrisome  aspect  is the limited information on UFJ.   Although  the&#13;
estimated 15-20% appears  low,  the lack of detailed information  (due to the&#13;
intermittent supplies) and the poor metering practices cast some doubt on the&#13;
validity of these figures.&#13;
30,   The generally sound financial performance of WSSD seem to have given rise&#13;
to:some complacency and a tightening of the management is required. Perceptions&#13;
of excess cash generation and overcharging for the still inadequate services&#13;
appear to be forming and increased levels of this may jeopardize WSSD's ability&#13;
to continue to impose adequate tariff levels in the future (PPAR. paras. 42-44).&#13;
The Role of the Bank&#13;
31.   The Bank's sustained and substantial (total lending US$336 million) support&#13;
for Bombay's water/sewerage services is both commendable and justified. Ie is,&#13;
therefore, surprising that this level of commitment to lend was not accompanied&#13;
by the allocation of adequate resources, commensurate with the complexities of&#13;
the project, particularly at the engineering level.  The Bank never seemed to&#13;
have recognized the exceptional scope and complexity of the projects (program).&#13;
and did not accord any special attention to them.  This lack of attention, and&#13;
possibly Bank staff's preoccupation with the monumental procurement problems,&#13;
undoubtedly contributed to the lack of early solutions to the project's&#13;
implementation problems.  It has also generated the only criticism of the Bank&#13;
by the top management of BMC which evidently relies heavily on the Bank for early&#13;
warning of problems.  Future Bank assistance for the completion of the delayed&#13;
work and future developmenc is still needed and expected, but, if granted, it&#13;
must be on che basis of utmost professionalism (particularly in the technical&#13;
areas) without fear or favor (PPAR, paras. 45 and 46).&#13;
Economic Analvsis&#13;
32.   The elaborate economic analysis presented in the SAR could not be repeated&#13;
eicher by the PCR or the Audit, due to the non-completion of the project (PPAR,&#13;
para. 47).&#13;
Conclusions ard Lessons&#13;
33.   The conclusions and lessons emerging from this project are both simple and&#13;
obvious.  The size and technical complexity of the project demanded a higher&#13;
level and more extensive technical supervisory input than the Bank, and WSSD,&#13;
have allocated.   Previously  good performance  on water  supply works  (which&#13;
continued under the Second project) may have led to complacency but the results&#13;
were disastrous for the sewerage works resulting in financial losses, delayed&#13;
benefits, and environmencal damage.&#13;

33.   Institutional  and  financial  performance  were,  on  the  whole.  highly&#13;
encouraging and should serve (minus the shortcomings mentioned) as a good example&#13;
for tcher agencies in India and elsewhere.&#13;
34.   The Bank's contribution to the water supply and sewerage developments in&#13;
Bombay are highly valued but, in this case. in the Audit's view, the Bank's&#13;
performance was found wanting in the areas of technical expertise and the&#13;
handling of the procuremene issues (PPAR. paras. 48-55).&#13;

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND APPROACH&#13;
Aim and Scope&#13;
1.    The aim of the Slum Sanitation Schemes is to provide sustainable improvements in sanitation&#13;
(with particular reference to safe excreta disposal) for about 1.0 million of the slum dwellers located&#13;
on municipally owned land. This will provide coverage for about 20 per cent of the estimated total of&#13;
5.5 million slum dwellers in Bombay.&#13;
Rationale&#13;
2.     Concern about inadequacies of sanitation in the slum communities has been expressed by the&#13;
MCGB itself, by the Government of India's Ministry of Environment and Forests (while granting its&#13;
environmental clearance for the BSDP), and recently by NGOs and the general public during the&#13;
public hearings on the Environmental Assessment of the Project. It was such concerns in the past that&#13;
prompted the inclusion of "low-cost sanitation" components in Bank-supported Second (FY79) and&#13;
Third (FY85) Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Projects. However, these initiatives were largely&#13;
unsuccessful, probably because of perverse incentives inherent in the approaches used. The BSDP's&#13;
approach to Slum Sanitation Schemes is designed to address such inadequacies. The goal of the new&#13;
approach is sustainability of installed facilities: and the strategy for achieving this goal is to create&#13;
incentives to induce investment and operational efficiencies. Accordingly, the approach to be followed&#13;
in the schemes will be demand-driven and participatory in nature. Its implementation will call for the&#13;
use of multi-disciplinary teams (of NGOs and technical personnel) to provide intermediation and&#13;
assistance to communities to make informed choices.&#13;
Slum and Technology Selection Criteria&#13;
3.    All choices will therefore be based on community demands. For example, selection of&#13;
participating communities will be based on: (a) community initiative and demand, and (b) satisfaction&#13;
of the "Policy Guidelines for Implementing Slum Sanitation Schemes" (Annex 14, p5) in order to&#13;
ensure that there is no involuntary resettlement. Communities will be offered a wider range of&#13;
technological options besides large-scale centralized blocks of public toilets; MCGB will ensure that&#13;
choice between such technologies and their locations reflect collective community views as a whole,&#13;
and not just those of a minority in the leadership. In addition, communities will: (i) make financial&#13;
contributions towards capital costs, (ii) participate in signing off on completed works, (iii) assume full&#13;
responsibility for operation and maintenance of installed facilities, and (iv) have permanent right of&#13;
use of such facilities.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
4.     The implementation of the schemes will follow a four-step approach. Step I will be used to&#13;
publicize information about the schemes, and to identify communities wishing to participate in the&#13;
schemes. During Step II, communities will be assisted by multi-disciplinary project teams to choose&#13;
the types and location of desired technological types. Following approval of these choices, the&#13;
communities will be assisted to prepare plans for operation and maintenance (i.e. facilities&#13;
maintenance plans), and to collect their upfront capital contributions. Step III is the step where&#13;
approved choices and designs will be constructed; and Step IV is for operation, maintenance and use&#13;
of the installed facilities by the communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 3 OF 17&#13;
5.     A two-phase adaptive approach will be used in implementing the schemes as described in&#13;
paragraph 4 above. Phase I (which will cover about 100,000 persons) will be a pilot phase for testing,&#13;
strengthening, and refining the institutional, technical, and financing strategies being followed.&#13;
Through concurrent monitoring and evaluation, the lessons from this phase will be used to finalize the&#13;
design for the full-scale operation in Phase II.&#13;
Consultant and NGO Services&#13;
6.     The following consultant/NGO services are included under the Slum Sanitation Schemes: (i)&#13;
consultancy for publicity and information dissemination, (ii) consultancy for multi-disciplinary project&#13;
teams, and (iii) consultancy for concurrent monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the&#13;
schemes.&#13;
7.     The consultants for publicity services will help to inform communities about the schemes so&#13;
that those interested in participating would step forward and apply for participation. Their functions&#13;
will include: (i) creating awareness about the schemes in specified slum settlements; (ii) creating&#13;
community-wide understanding of the conditions to be satisfied to qualify for participation in the&#13;
schemes; (iii) assisting interested slum communities to make estimates of the level of upfront&#13;
contributions they must make toward capital costs of improved sanitation facilities they desire; and&#13;
(iv) helping interested communities to apply for participation.&#13;
8.     The multi-disciplinary project teams will serve as intermediaries and facilitators to&#13;
communities that are selected to participated in the schemes. Their functions will include the&#13;
following: (i) helping communities to choose feasible technological options of toilets; (ii) helping&#13;
communities to identify suitable locations for such toilets, having regard to the Policy Guidelines for&#13;
Implementing Slum Sanitation Schemes" in order to avoid involuntary resettlement. The multi-&#13;
disciplinary project teams will also help communities to organize themselves, help them to prepare&#13;
facilities maintenance plans, train them to undertake technical tasks they wish to undertake by&#13;
themselves, and provide them with hygiene and health education.&#13;
9.     The consultancy for concurrent monitoring and evaluation is designed to find out what&#13;
changes, if any, need to be made to improve the policy framework and implementation strategy for&#13;
the slum sanitation schemes. The scope of work will include the development of a detailed program&#13;
for such concurrent monitoring and evaluation, implementation of the agreed program for monitoring&#13;
and evaluation, and feedback of the results to the MCGB for use in improving and adapting the&#13;
ongoing schemes.&#13;
Withdrawal Certification&#13;
10.   Withdrawal applications with respect to the slum sanitation schemes will be required to&#13;
include certification of compliance with the "Policy Guidelines for Implementing Slum Sanitation&#13;
Schemes" (Annex 14, p 5).&#13;
Institutional Framework&#13;
11.   The Deputy City Engineer (Slums), assisted by a minimum of three full time experienced&#13;
urban community development officers of the MCGB, will have direct responsibility for day-to-day&#13;
activities. The Deputy City Engineer (Slums will report to the Deputy/Additional Municipal Engineer&#13;

INDIA: PROPOSED BOMBAY SEWAGE DISPOSAL PROJECT&#13;
POLICY GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTING SLUM SANITATION SCHEMES&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    These guidelines provide the principles and instructions which will ensure that all persons&#13;
affected, regardless of their land tenure status, will be assisted to improve, or at least restore, their&#13;
living standards, income earning or production capacity, and quality of life to pre-project levels.&#13;
2.     A slum dweller is any one who owns or occupies a physical structure in a slum community&#13;
and has lived there for at least one year. A slum dweller is said to be affected if: (i) his/her dwelling&#13;
place is not moved, but however is affected by the physical facilities installed under a slum sanitation&#13;
scheme of the Bombay Sewage Disposal Project or (ii) his/her dwelling place is moved as a result of&#13;
such scheme.&#13;
3.    All choices in such schemes will result from community demands: participation will be based&#13;
on community selection; and choice of sanitation technologies and their location within slum&#13;
communities will be made by beneficiary communities themselves, with technical guidance by multi-&#13;
disciplinary project teams consisting of NGOs and engineers.&#13;
4.    Criteria for the selection of sites eligible for Bank financing include:&#13;
(a)    consensus of the community affected by the siting of the sanitation facilities, which&#13;
consensus would be recorded in the minutes of the meetings;&#13;
(b)    payment of full restitution to the affected slum dwellers by the beneficiary slum&#13;
communities prior to implementation of the scheme for such site; and&#13;
(c)    adjustments of structures and movement of households should be within the same slum&#13;
community and within a radius of not more than 100 meters from the original location&#13;
of the structure or household.&#13;
Restitution Principles&#13;
5.    The MCGB shall, or shall ensure, that all restitution be related to actual loss sustained, and&#13;
that any of the following means of restitution, or their combination, have been provided by&#13;
beneficiary slum communities to affected persons:&#13;
(a)    replacement location for structures within the slum community;&#13;
(b)    materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures to be fully or partially&#13;
demolished; and&#13;
(c)    other acceptable in-kind restitution.&#13;

ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 6 OF 17&#13;
Consultation Process&#13;
6.    The MCGB shall, or shall ensure, that the choice of technologies and their locations reflect&#13;
the collective views of the community as a whole, and not those of a minority in a leadership&#13;
position; that all occupants of land and owners of assets affected are consulted. There will be&#13;
community meetings to inform slum dwellers of their rights and the options available in accordance&#13;
with these guidelines. Minutes of these meetings shall be prepared promptly and shall reflect the&#13;
discussions held, agreements reached, and include the following:&#13;
(a)    for land/asset vacated against restitution, names of affected persons and details about&#13;
the nature and level of restitution;&#13;
(b)    type of structure or assets affected, with valuation at replacement cost;&#13;
(c)    signature of office-bearers of the community association or society; and&#13;
(d)    record of any complaints raised by affected persons&#13;
7.     The multi-disciplinary project team assigned to the community shall provide a copy of the&#13;
minutes to affected persons and confirm in discussions with each of them their requests for restitution,&#13;
agreements reached, and any eventual complaints.&#13;
Approval of Community Choices&#13;
8.    Prior to the commencement of detailed design and construction of selected technological&#13;
options, the MCGB shall, or shall ensure, that:&#13;

OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROGRAM PUBLICITY&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    As a part of the proposed Bombay Sewage Disposal Project (BSDP), the MCGB wishes to&#13;
implement a Slum Sanitation Program to improve the human excreta disposal for slum dwellers&#13;
occupying the municipal land in Bombay.&#13;
2.    Past approaches to the program of slum sanitation services have not been sustainable over&#13;
long periods. It is estimated that only about 20 percent of the existing pubic toilets in slum areas are&#13;
functioning satisfactorily. A rapid review has shown the underlying cause of poor functioning of such&#13;
toilets to be rooted in the inappropriateness of the institutional arrangements used in providing and&#13;
maintaining the toilets. For example, past approaches have been supply-driven, with little or no&#13;
participation of beneficiaries in the choice and siting of facilities, their ownership or their operation&#13;
and maintenance.&#13;
3.    To address these problems, the MCGB wishes to introduce a number of innovative measures&#13;
known to be conducive to the sustainability of such services. In particular, it wishes to follow a&#13;
demand based approach in the selection of participating communities and in the choice and siting of&#13;
toilet facilities.&#13;
4.    The following are the four key steps in the implementation of this approach:&#13;
Step 1:      program publicity and selection of communities who qualify to participate in&#13;
the program;&#13;
Step 2:      demand assessment and community level project preparation;&#13;
Step 3:      design and construction of selected sanitation facilities; and&#13;
Step 4:      operation, maintenance and use of installed facilities.&#13;
This consultancy is concerned only with Step 1 - program publicity.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
5.    The objectives of this assignment are:&#13;
(a)   to create awareness about the program in specified slum settlements;&#13;
(b)   to create community-wide understanding of the conditions to be satisfied to qualify for&#13;
participation in the program;&#13;
(c)   to enable interested slum settlements to make an estimate of the level of upfront contribution&#13;
they must make towards capital costs of improved sanitation facilities; and&#13;
(d)   to enable interested communities to apply for participation.&#13;

communities in Attachment 1 (to be provided by MCGB) which have been identified for this&#13;
assignment. Attachment 2 and 3 are respectively (i) the proposed Overall Policy Framework and (ii)&#13;
the proposed Strategy and Approach. The scope of activities to be carried out by the consultants shall&#13;
include, but shall not necessarily be limited to the activities described below.&#13;
General Awareness about Program&#13;
7.     Using appropriate aids and materials, the consultants will help the identified settlement to&#13;
understand the following:&#13;
-    goals of the program;&#13;
-    rules of program;&#13;
-    criteria for participation by communities and slum settlements;&#13;
-    phasing of implementation;&#13;
-    key implementation steps;&#13;
-    conditions to be met before moving from one step to the next;&#13;
-    roles of conimunities;&#13;
-    roles of MCGB;&#13;
-    roles of intermediaries and project teams; and&#13;
-    expected immediate and long-term benefits form the program.&#13;
Awareness about Oualification for Participation&#13;
8.     Through appropriate consultation processes, the consultants shall create community-wide&#13;
awareness about the screening criteria for slum communities to participate in the program.&#13;
Upfront Contribution towards Capital Costs&#13;
9.     The consultants shall explain: (i) why it is considered necessary for communities to contribute&#13;
to capital costs; (ii) the level of per household contributions; and (iii) how the total upfront&#13;
contributions to capital costs are estimated, using the information on the estimated number of&#13;
household in the settlement.&#13;
Applying for Participation in Program&#13;
10.   The consultants shall explain the procedure for applying for participation in the program,&#13;
including the level of application fees, and where to the submit application documents and pay&#13;
application fees.&#13;

QUALIFICATIONS AND REQUIRED SKILLS&#13;
12.   The task is to be carried out by NGOs with appropriate experience. The selected NGOs&#13;
would be responsible for designing the campaign and disseminating the information about the&#13;
program. The involvement NGOs is necessary because of their close association with communities,&#13;
possession of social skills, and their use of participatory approaches. The community development&#13;
group in the MCGB would provide the basic information and would assume the supervisory role.&#13;

OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR MULTI-DISCIPLINARY PROJECT TEAM&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The MCGB proposes to implement a Slum sanitation Program which focuses primarily on&#13;
improved facilities for human excreta disposal in selected slum localities situated on the municipal&#13;
lands in Bombay. This program is a part of the Bombay Sewage Disposal Project. Its goal is to&#13;
deliver direct sanitation benefits to about one million people living on municipally owned land. The&#13;
program will follow a demand driven approach and other innovative strategies. It will be&#13;
implemented in two phases in a flexible and adaptable way. The first phase will be extended to a few&#13;
selected slum localities covering an estimated population of about 100,000. There will be intensive&#13;
testing and monitoring of new strategies during this phase. The lessons learnt in this phase will be&#13;
used to design and implement the full scale program in phase II.&#13;
2.    The following are the four key steps in implementation of this approach:&#13;
Sten 1:      program publicity and selection of communities who qualify to participate in&#13;
the program;&#13;
Step 2:      demand assessment and community level project preparation;&#13;
Step 3:      design and construction of selected sanitation facilities; and&#13;
Step 4:      operation, maintenance and use of installed facilities.&#13;
3.     The Program publicity will be undertaken to disseminate information about the project&#13;
separately and this particular assignment will be carried out only in those communities who have&#13;
come forward to participate in the program. The assignment will be carried out only from step 2&#13;
onwards as mentioned in para 2 above.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.    The objectives of the proposed multi-disciplinary Project Team are:&#13;
(a) slum scheme implementation in accordance with the related "Policy Guidelines";&#13;
(b)  to help the communities in choosing the feasible technical options of toilets;&#13;
(c)  to assist the communities in identifying the suitable locations;&#13;
(d)  to provide guidance to the communities in preparing a Facilities Maintenance Plan;&#13;
(e)  to impart necessary skills in construction supervision, accounting, book-keeping, etc. to&#13;
enable the community to assume full responsibility in implementing the program;&#13;
(f)  to assist the communities in choosing the executive mechanism of the program;&#13;
(g)  to undertake health education activities for improving the environmental conditions in the&#13;
slums; and&#13;
(h)  to provide back-up and necessary orientation to implement the Facilities maintenance Plan.&#13;

SCOPE OF ASSIGNMENT&#13;
5.     This assignment is to be restricted to only those slum communities which are selected through&#13;
a screening process. A list of selected slums is given in Attachment 1 (to be provided by MCGB).&#13;
The scope of activities to be carried out by the Project Team shall include but shall not necessarily be&#13;
limited to the activities described below.&#13;
Demand Assessment and Community level preparation&#13;
6.     The Project Team shall undertake the following tasks to help the communities in program&#13;
implementation:&#13;
(a)   review feasible technical options and their costs in order to enable the community to choose&#13;
options they want and are willing to pay for;&#13;
(b)   assist the communities in identifying the suitable sites and helping them in readjusting some of&#13;
the structures, if necessary in order to avoid involuntary resettlement;&#13;
(c)   assist the communities in forming registered associations/Societies for collection of upfront&#13;
contributions towards capital costs on a family basis;&#13;
(d)   explain to the communities their responsibilities towards construction supervision, financial&#13;
liabilities towards capital cost as well as operation/maintenance; and&#13;
(e)   assist the communities to prepare a Facilities Maintenance Plan and helping them to get it&#13;
approved by the MCGB.&#13;
Design and construction&#13;
7.     Once the communities proposals are accepted, the Project Team will undertake following tasks&#13;
during this stage:&#13;
(a)   helping the community to determine and approve the layout or design of the proposed sites;&#13;
(b)   imparting training to the selected members of the community for supervision of construction&#13;
work;&#13;
(c)   assist the community to choose the execution mechanism in construction;&#13;
(d)   providing site supervision and receiving feed back from the community;&#13;
(e)   reporting the results of supervision to the MCGB; and&#13;
(f)   assisting the communities to sign off on installed facilities.&#13;
Operation, Maintenance and Use&#13;
8.     During this stage the Project Team will provide back-up to the community for implementation&#13;
of the Facilities Implementation Plan and assist in mobilizing operation and maintenance contributions&#13;
from the users.&#13;
Health Education&#13;
9.     One of the objectives of the program is to alleviate health risks and improve the&#13;
environmental conditions in slums. In order to achieve this, the Project Team is expected to&#13;
undertake health and hygiene education throughout the process of this assignment as a parallel&#13;
activity. The health education should contain aspects related to proper disposal of solid wastes,&#13;
handling and storage of potable drinking water, personal hygiene, etc. Appropriate methods for this&#13;

program are to be designed by the Project Team for inclusion in the consultation process following&#13;
approval from MCGB.&#13;
Training&#13;
10.   The purpose of this activity is to provide related training in the various tasks proposed by the&#13;
beneficiaries in order to build their capacities to manage all the activities proposed by them. These&#13;
include construction, supervision during construction, accounting, book-keeping, operation and&#13;
maintenance, etc. The training activities should start from step 2 onward and continue throughout the&#13;
implementation process.&#13;
METHODOLOGY&#13;
11.   The Project Team is required to follow the process of beneficiary consultation and community&#13;
involvement. The aim of this process is to promote beneficiary participation in technological choices&#13;
and location and the construction, operation, and maintenance of the selected technologies in order to&#13;
ensure that the proposed program delivers the expected benefits to communities on a sustainable basis.&#13;
This process is necessary because the successful implementation of the program depends upon&#13;
responsiveness to beneficiary preferences. The Project Team would design the appropriate procedures&#13;
for conducting the consultation process.&#13;
12.   The Project Team shall prepare an Inception Report indicating how the entire beneficiary&#13;
consultation process will be initiated in order to achieve the aims of the program and also provide the&#13;
composition of the team with an appropriate mix of skills. Further, the Project Team shall participate&#13;
in the project launch workshop along with other teams to discuss and finalize the process of&#13;
beneficiary consultation. The Project Team is required to maintain a close communication with the&#13;
designated MCGB's officials to provide continuous feed-back to enable them to make timely&#13;
adjustment to the program.&#13;
REPORTING&#13;
Record Keeping of consultations&#13;
13.   The Project Team is expected to provide a brief report after completion of each&#13;
task/consultation. This should include notification to the community, and record of follow-up action&#13;
points agreed at the consultation meetings. The Project Team will also prepare a final report&#13;
containing description of the entire process of consultations and lessons learnt and modifications and&#13;
improvements needed for the Stage I.&#13;
Ouarterlv reports&#13;
14.   Quarterly reports on the progress and the impact of activities will be submitted to the MCGB.&#13;
In addition, a report will be submitted upon successful implementation of the activities under each&#13;
step of the implementation process.&#13;

ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 15 OF 17&#13;
OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONCURRENT MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    A slum sanitation program focussed on excreta disposal is proposed to be implemented for&#13;
about one million slum dwellers living on MCGB land. The program will be implemented in two&#13;
phases. The first phase (for 100,000 people) will be used to test models of a beneficiary sense of&#13;
"ownership" of facilities, choice of technologies, financing capital and recurrent costs, and operating&#13;
and maintaining installed facilities.&#13;
2.    The design of the program's implementation process is driven by an overall policy framework&#13;
(available from the (MCGB). The framework has such innovative features as: (i) demand-based&#13;
approach in the selection of communities to receive services under the program; (ii) widening of&#13;
technological options used in providing sanitation services to slum dwellers; (iii) responsiveness to&#13;
the technologies chosen by beneficiaries; (iv) community sense of 'ownership" and maintenance of&#13;
installed facilities; (v) community contribution to capital costs; and (vi) assignment of operation and&#13;
maintenance responsibilities to the beneficiary communities.&#13;
3.    The implementation process follows the four steps given below:&#13;
Step 1:      program publicity and selection of communities who qualify to participate in&#13;
the program;&#13;
Step 2:      demand assessment and community level project preparation;&#13;
Step 3:      design and construction of selected sanitation facilities; and&#13;
Step 4:      operation, maintenance and use of installed facilities.&#13;
4.    The implementation will be accompanied by concurrent monitoring and evaluation. It will&#13;
also be sufficiently flexible and adaptive to permit adjustments to be made in the policy measures and&#13;
strategies. The lessons learnt from the first phase will be used to design and implement the second&#13;
phase of the program. It is anticipated that the experience of the two phases will provide MCGB with&#13;
a strategy for expanding improved sanitation services to all slums in the city.&#13;
5.    This consultancy is concerned with the development and implementation of a concurrent&#13;
monitoring and evaluation program for the MCGB slum sanitation program. The work envisaged&#13;
under this consultancy is to be carried out over a period of about three years, and it will be subject to&#13;
possible extension.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
6.    One primary objective of this consultancy is to find out what changes, if any, need to be made&#13;
to improve the policy framework and implementation strategy for the slum sanitation program being&#13;
undertaken by MCGB. This entails an assessment of compliance with the related "Policy Guidelines"&#13;
and a determination of how implementation strategies are affecting overall performance as well as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 16 OF 17&#13;
performance at each of the four steps in the implementation process [para. 3 above] in the&#13;
development and provision of improved slum sanitation services.&#13;
7.     The monitoring and evaluation program should also include an assessment of the impact on&#13;
performance of consultants, the inter-disciplinary teams assisting communities, and other public&#13;
officials and other institutional teams and personnel. In addition, it should include an assessment of&#13;
the decision making processes at comrnunity level to ascertain the extent to which local decision&#13;
making is truly participatory and inclusive.&#13;
SCOPE OF THE WORK&#13;
8.     The scope of work covers the following:&#13;
(a)    development of a detailed program for concurrent monitoring and evaluation;&#13;
(b)    implementation of the agreed monitoring and evaluation program; and&#13;
(c)    feedback to MCGB for improvement and adaptation of ongoing slum sanitation&#13;
program.&#13;
Development of Detailed Monitoring and Evaluation Program&#13;
9.     Using a participatory approach, the consultant shall develop a detailed program for the&#13;
concurrent monitoring and evaluation of the slum sanitation program. This will entail, but will not&#13;
necessarily be limited to, the following activities: (i) review of appropriate project documents,&#13;
especially the overall policy framework, the proposed strategy and approach, and the Staff Appraisal&#13;
Report of the World Bank; (ii) discussions with key officials and participants in the program,&#13;
including: MCGB officials, NGOs and other consultants involved in the program, leaders of&#13;
participating communities, community members, and World Bank officials; (iii) preliminary field&#13;
visits to participating communities; and (iv) participation in a program launch workshop.&#13;
10.   The detailed program for concurrent monitoring and evaluation will define (for each step in&#13;
the implementation process and for the overall program) a set of indicators which describe: (a) the&#13;
key outcomes to be monitored; (b) the likely determinants (or explanatory variables) of the outcomes;&#13;
(c) the relevance of the parameters to be followed; and (d) the methodology for measuring or&#13;
assessing the outcomes and their determinants. The consultant should ascertain which provisions of&#13;
the policy framework are the determinants of the observed outcomes.&#13;
11.   In the case of Step 1 (program publicity and selection of communities), for example, a key&#13;
outcome would be the number of communities that step forward to apply for participation in the&#13;
program. This number may be too high, too low or just what was anticipated. The determinants (or&#13;
explanatory variables) for this outcome may include: effectiveness of the publicity campaign,&#13;
agreement or disagreement of community with policy on financial contributions towards capital costs,&#13;
the level of contribution towards capital costs, availability of alternative sanitation programs that are&#13;
not so demanding on beneficiaries, or absence of preferred solutions in the range of technological&#13;
options. Similarly, the outcomes and determinants from the other steps can be identified as&#13;
parameters to be followed in the concurrent monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 17 OF 17&#13;
12.   The detailed program should also include a definition of the timing and locations of the&#13;
observations and measurements or assessments to be made; it will also include information on the&#13;
reporting intervals and what will be included in the reports.&#13;
13.   The consultant will be expected to make a presentation on the detailed program for the&#13;
concurrent monitoring and evaluation during the program launch workshop.&#13;
Implementation of Agreed Monitoring and Evaluation Program&#13;
14.   Once approved, the consultant will apply the monitoring and evaluation program to the first&#13;
two steps of in the implementation process. As it is with other components of the slum sanitation&#13;
program, the monitoring and evaluation program will itself be subject to periodic review at intervals&#13;
to be determined and agreed with the MCGB.&#13;
Feedback to MCGB&#13;
15.   The consultant shall provide timely reports on the results of the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
program to the MCGB. The contents of the reports shall include, but will not necessarily be limited&#13;
to, where monitoring observations were made, what parameters were observed, findings of the&#13;
observations, and recommended actions arising from the findings.&#13;
16.   In addition to the periodic reports, the consultant will prepare a final report summarizing the&#13;
entire monitoring and evaluation activities undertaken during the period of assignment, and the overall&#13;
findings and recommendations.&#13;
QUALIFICATIONS AND REQUIRED SKILLS&#13;
17.   The assignment is to be carried out by a social science institution, an NGO or a consultant&#13;
with analytical skills, especially in the design of field surveys and in the various forms of statistical&#13;
analysis.&#13;

            India - Bombay Sewage Disposal Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Bombay Sewage
            Disposal Project are to: 1) strengthen the capacity of the
            Water Supply and Sewerage Department of the Municipal
            Corporation of Greater Bombay in all aspects of the
            management of the provision of sewerage services; 2) sustain
            the financial viability of the provision of water supply and
            sewerage services in Greater Bombay through direct charges
            to beneficiaries at appropriate levels; and 3) improve the
            health and environmental conditions in Greater Bombay
            including slum dwellers. The project includes: 1) the
            construction of two submarine tunnel outfall sewers at each
            of Worli and Bandra to convey partially treated sewage
            effluent to the Arabian Sea; 2) a pumping station at Bandra;
            3) two aerated sewage treatment lagoons at Ghatkopar and
            Bhandup; 4) facilities to prevent siltation in the influent
            tunnel at Ghatkopar; 5) the rehabilitation of the existing
            Ghatkopar tunnel; 6) measures to improve the structural
            stability of five existing sewage pumping stations; 7)
            conveyance systems improvements; and 8) slum sanitation schemes.
