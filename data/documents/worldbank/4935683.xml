&#13;
1 BackgroundandStrategy&#13;
&#13;
1.1 Background&#13;
&#13;
1. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is potentially one o f Africa's richest&#13;
economies, with extensive forest, mineral, and energy resources. Its regional importance,&#13;
with a large labor force and potentialmarket size, extensive navigable inlandwaterways&#13;
and land links to nine states, could make the DRC a motor for regional growth as&#13;
significant as Nigeria or South Africa.       However, this promise has been repeatedly&#13;
thwarted. Successive governments have been able neither to translate this potential into&#13;
satisfactory living conditions for the Congolese people nor to effectively fight corruption&#13;
by special interests. As the State slowly collapsed in the last decade of the regime of&#13;
Mobuto Sese Seko (1965-97), much o f the productive capital was abandoned or&#13;
destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
2.   Since the early 199Os, the Great Lakes region has been embroiled in a series o f&#13;
closely interlinked conflicts stemming from a complex interaction o f poor governance,&#13;
security dilemmas and competition for the control o f economic rents. The war in the&#13;
DRC started as a Congolese civil war, but drew in two opposing regional blocs. Some&#13;
unfinished civil wars and regional rivalries were also being fought inthe Congo, adding&#13;
fuel to the fire o f localdomestic conflicts, especially inIturiand the Kivus.&#13;
&#13;
3.   Within the context of the 1999 Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement, there has been&#13;
significant progress towards peace and reconciliation since the beginning o f 2001. The&#13;
centerpieces o fthis progress are:&#13;
&#13;
    (0      TheInter-Congolese Dialogue: On April 2, 2003 in Sun City, the participants&#13;
            inthe Inter-Congolese Dialogue signed the Final Act of the Inter-Congolese&#13;
            political negotiations, endorsing agreements that constitute a comprehensive&#13;
            program for the restoration o f peace and national sovereignty during a&#13;
            transition period o f two years. The agreements include the Global and All-&#13;
            Inclusive Agreement on the Transition in the Democratic Republic o f the&#13;
            Congo (December 2002), the Transitional Constitution, the memorandum on&#13;
            military and security issues (March 2003), and the 36 resolutions adopted by&#13;
            the Inter-Congolese DialogueinSun City (March andApril 2002).&#13;
    (ii) Thedisarmamentanddemobilization of foreign armedgroups: TheUnited&#13;
            Nations Mission to the DRC, MONUC, was established in 1999 to monitor&#13;
            the cease-fire agreement and develop an action plan for its implementation,&#13;
            including the Disarmament, Demobilization, Repatriation, Resettlement and&#13;
            Reinsertion (DDRRR) of foreign armed groups operating in the DRC. There&#13;
            remain an estimated 15,000 foreign combatants to be disarmed, demobilized&#13;
            andrepatriated.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Social Action Project, Democratic Republic of Congo - TechnicalAnnex            2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    (iii) The withdrawal of foreign troops: The Government of DRC signed&#13;
            agreements with the Governments of Rwanda (July 2002) and Uganda&#13;
            (September 2002) that pavedthe way for awithdrawal o f foreigntroops.&#13;
&#13;
    (iv)    On July 28, 2003 the mandate of MONUC was extended to include the&#13;
            demobilizationo f Congolese combatants (Resolution 1493,2003).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.   However, the situation in the Kivus, Nord-Katanga, and Ituri, requires special&#13;
attention. An expanding UN force and the Dar-Es-Salaam ceasefire agreement (May&#13;
2003) signed by irregular Ituri forces, and the establishment o f the Ituri Interim&#13;
Administration have helped stabilize the area and allowed planning for DDR&#13;
(Demobilization, Disarmament, andReinsertion.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.2   Economic and Social Impact&#13;
&#13;
5.   The effects o f Africa's first continent-scale war inthe DRC have been dramatic. An&#13;
estimated 3.5 million people have died since 1998, both from the violence itself and from&#13;
starvation and disease, making this conflict the deadliest since World War 11. An&#13;
estimated 3 million people are displaced, with 500,000 DRC refugees in neighboring&#13;
countries.   The conflict has exacerbated ethnic rivalries and tensions over land and&#13;
territory ineastem Congo, posing a long-term challenge to the transition to peace.&#13;
&#13;
6. DRC is now one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy, already&#13;
affected by decades o f poor governance, has collapsed. Per capita income declined&#13;
steadily from US$380 in 1985 to US$250 in 1990 and to US$85 in 2000. It increased to&#13;
$100 in2002. Infrastructure, which was deteriorating underthe Mobuturegime, hasbeen&#13;
largely destroyed during the conflict, leaving few roads and only sporadic access to&#13;
electricity and safe water for a large majority o fthe population.&#13;
&#13;
7. Social indicators, already low before the war, have dropped further inrecent years. A&#13;
study by the World Health Organization and UNICEF revealed that the vast majority of&#13;
the population live on the equivalent o f US$0.20 per person per day, and consume less&#13;
than two thirds of the daily calories needed to maintain good health. Hospitals, clinics&#13;
and preventative health initiatives have been devastated. Approximately 70 percent of&#13;
the population has little or no access to health care. Schools and training centers have&#13;
closed, leavinga generation without education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.3   Government Response and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
8.    The Government is committed to a successful economic recovery and political&#13;
reconciliation process. It has pledged to keep its economic reform program on track,&#13;
restore institutional unity while allowing for necessary decentralization, and provide&#13;
rapid financial support in the eastern and northern parts o f the country.            The&#13;
Government's strategic agenda benefits from a large degree o f support beyond&#13;
Government circles and hasbeen endorsed by all key stakeholders.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9. Since 2001, the Government has launched a program o f economic reforms aimed at&#13;
restoring macro-economic stability and kick-starting economic activity, while tackling&#13;
some governance issues inherited from the past. This programis being implementedwith&#13;
the support ofthe World Bank andthe International Monetary Fund(IMF). InSeptember&#13;
2002, the Paris Club granted debt relief on Naples terms, and inJuly 2003, DRC reached&#13;
the decision point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. London Club negotiations began&#13;
in February 2003. In-depth structural reforms have been launched in the areas of&#13;
economic governance, public expenditure management, poverty reduction, transparency,&#13;
financial sector and public enterprises reform, and local and foreign investment, among&#13;
others. Inthe mining and forestry sectors, new codes supported by IDA have established&#13;
a new environment, one promotingthe competitive and transparent development o f these&#13;
important sectors for the benefit o f all the people o f Congo, including future generations.&#13;
After years o f decline, the economy grew at 3 percent in 2002 and at an estimated 5&#13;
percent in2003.&#13;
&#13;
10. PRSP. Since 2002, the Government has been implementing an I-PRSP based on&#13;
wide consultations with civil society and community groups. Although it was developed&#13;
by a previous government, the Inter-Congolese Dialogue and later the new Transition&#13;
Government endorsed this work. The I-PRSP rests upon three pillars: (i)       restoration and&#13;
consolidation o f peace and sustainable good governance; (ii)macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization and pro-poor growth; and (iii)community dynamics (community-led&#13;
development initiatives). The Government has been developing its fill PRSP through a&#13;
representative and participatory process. The Joint Staff Assessment o f the I-PRSP and&#13;
the 2003 annual up-date have been reviewedby the Boards o f IDA and the IMF. With&#13;
efforts continuing at the current pace, the fillPRSP i s expected by the fourth quarter o f&#13;
2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.4    InternationalResponse&#13;
&#13;
11. International NGOs, UN agencies, and the ICRC have acquired considerable&#13;
experience inDRC over the last decade through the provision o f humanitarian assistance&#13;
inareas such ashealth andnutrition, safedrinkingwater, andagriculture. Theseprograms&#13;
continue to provide essential support, particularly in the East. The rapid deterioration o f&#13;
the humanitarian situation in the Ituri region in 2003 led to a European Union armed&#13;
peace-imposing mission ledby France, which has since beentaken over by MONUC.&#13;
&#13;
12. The international community has been re-engaging inDRC over the past three years&#13;
following nearly a decade o f suspension o f activities. Ithas supported and encouragedthe&#13;
peace-process and backed the government by resuming a number o f development&#13;
initiatives that had been suspended. A Consultative Group o f major donors agreed on a&#13;
coordinated support strategy for DRC in Paris in 2002 with the following priorities: (i)&#13;
helprestore sound economic governance; (ii) the fiscal cost o freunification; (iii)&#13;
                                                   mitigate&#13;
support rehabilitation o f essential infrastructure and the restoring o f social services in&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
eastem and northem areas; and (iv) assist in the demobilization and reintegration o f&#13;
former combatants, inthe context of a broader efforts for communityrecovery.&#13;
&#13;
13. Another Consultative Group meeting held in December 2003 resulted in the&#13;
commitment o f nearly $4 billion. Nearly all bilateral donors announced significant&#13;
increases in financial aid over the period 2003-2006, with a particular focus on poverty&#13;
reductionand post-conflict reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
14. As a key element inits strategy for DRC, the Bank has established a working-level,&#13;
virtual coordinationgroup, where donors can share data, inform each other on their plans&#13;
and ongoing activities, organize joint missions, and discuss informally options for the&#13;
way ahead. This is a very flexible mechanism that complements coordination activities&#13;
on the ground, Kinshasa, andother locations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2    IDA Strategy andResponse&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15. The objective o f the Bank's activities in DRC is to contribute to the transition to&#13;
peace and stability inthe country and sub-region. The first phase of support was framed&#13;
within the context of a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS, July 2001) and aimed to: (i)&#13;
meet basic and urgent needs; (ii) effective public institutions and policies; (iii)&#13;
                                      rebuild&#13;
revitalize economic activity; and (iv) rebuildimplementationcapacity.&#13;
&#13;
16. A new TSS was discussed by the Board in February 2004.                   It builds on the&#13;
achievements o f the last two years with a view to deepening support infour key areas: (i)&#13;
social stability and security, including the need for Government rapidly to establish the&#13;
institutions to support a program o f demobilization, disarmament and reinsertion (DDR)&#13;
and reform o f the combined army, and for the donor community to support such a&#13;
program; (ii)   shared economic growth, including deepening o f ongoing economic&#13;
reforms, re-establishment o fpay systems for public servants, and support to a competitive&#13;
private sector; (iii)capacity and governance, including transparency, equitable&#13;
enforcement o f regulations, clarification o f roles between levels o f government, and&#13;
continuation o f reforms in the natural resource sector; and (iv) social development,&#13;
including additional resourcesfor education, healthand community self-help activities.&#13;
&#13;
17. Bank support to the DRC's post-conflict recovery was first approved in October&#13;
1997 with a US$ 2 million Post Conflict grant to assist the newlyinstalledgovernment o f&#13;
President Laurent-DCsirC Kabila to: (i)prepare a Demobilization and Reinsertion&#13;
Program for vulnerable groups; and (ii)     launchcommunity-based activities inthe Eastern&#13;
provinces o f the country.         In July 2001, the Board approved a US$ 50 million&#13;
Emergency EarlyRecovery Project, fundedthrough an IDA grant.&#13;
&#13;
18. Subsequently, following the clearance o f DRC arrears in June 2002, the Board&#13;
approved a US$ 450 million ERC in June 2002, a US$ 454 million Emergency Multi-&#13;
sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (EMRRP) in August 2002, and a US$&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency SocialAction Project, Democratic Republic of Congo- TechnicalAnnex                  5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
120 million Private Sector Development and Competitiveness Project inJuly 2003. The&#13;
Emergency Economic and Social Reunification Project ($214 million), approved in&#13;
September 2003, and the Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit ($200 million),&#13;
approved inFebruary2004, provide further support to the Government for economic and&#13;
social recovery. An Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project ($100 million&#13;
IDA grant and $100 million MDRP grant) has beenprepared and was approved by the&#13;
Board on M a y25,2004.&#13;
&#13;
19. The Bank is also managing a multi-donor Trust Fund that finances the Emergency&#13;
Stabilization and Recovery Project (ESRP), with contributions from the Governments of&#13;
Belgium and Canada as well as from the European Commission.                 Capacity-building&#13;
training has been provided by the World Bank Institute and through technical assistance&#13;
under the Public Expenditure and Financial Accounting program, to support the&#13;
Government's efforts at redefiningthe roles o f the various levels of Government.&#13;
&#13;
20. Restructuring existing credits. The existing IDA portfolio consists o f 5 projects with&#13;
satisfactory performance. None o f these projects could be restructured to implement the&#13;
Emergency Social Action Project. However, there i s scope to develop synergies between&#13;
this project and existing projects particularly in terms of reintegration activities,&#13;
especially with the Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project as well as the&#13;
Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP),which has recently been launched in DRC.&#13;
The Social Fundprovides a mechanism to support community-based activities that are a&#13;
necessary complement to the individually targeted reintegration activities financed under&#13;
the Emergency DemobilizationandReintegrationProject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.1   Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
21. The Emergency Social Action Project would provide critical and timely support to&#13;
help mitigate the ongoing social and humanitarian crisis in DRC, thus facilitating the&#13;
continued successful implementation o f economic reform, political reunification, and&#13;
durable peace. The Bank's involvement i s also justified by the amount o f resources&#13;
requiredandthe needto beresponsive to a client request.&#13;
&#13;
22. Emerging from a decade o f civil war and thirty years o f mismanagement, few&#13;
institutions function nationally in the DRC. In order to survive during the period o f&#13;
government neglect and civil strife, communities have organized themselves to provide&#13;
services and infrastructure - schools, clinics, roads -which inother situations are usually&#13;
provided by government. It seems unlikelythat inthe near term the Government will be&#13;
able to substantially augment these services, but there i s a tremendous popular demand&#13;
for increasedand improved services. All parties inthe transition government are eager to&#13;
quickly show the benefit o fthe peaceprocess.&#13;
&#13;
23. At the same time, the Government is demobilizing 150,000 combatants who will be&#13;
retumingto local communities. Linkingthe return o f ex-combatants with the possibility&#13;
of receiving recovery and development assistance may smooth the reintegrationprocess:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency SocialAction Project, Democratic Republic of Congo- TechnicalAnnex                  6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Project will provide access to social services and income-earning opportunities to&#13;
persons formerly associatedwith the fighting. Providingbenefits directly to communities&#13;
will help prevent local resentment that could arise if assistance is only going to ex-&#13;
combatants.&#13;
&#13;
24. One o f the three pillars o f the Government's I-PRSP (May 2002) is community&#13;
dynamics.    This includes the creation of a national policy framework that supports&#13;
community-driven activities, support for capacity-building activities targeted at the&#13;
community-level, and establishment o f a fund in support o f community-driven&#13;
development.      The Bank's 2004 TSS has community reintegration and social&#13;
development as primary objectives -with a particular emphasis on education, health, and&#13;
community self-help -andidentifies a social fund as akey mechanism to implement such&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
25. The Emergency Social Action Project, in providing money directly to communities&#13;
via a social fund mechanism, would respond to the goals of the I-PRSP, TSS, and&#13;
coordinated donor priorities, as well as the need to show rapidresults on the ground and&#13;
take advantage o f the current situation where communities have to a certain extent taken&#13;
charge o ftheir own development. Supported sub-projects would increase access to social&#13;
services and or income-earning capacity o f the poor, including former combatants and&#13;
their communities.      By building local and provincial capacity for planning and&#13;
implementing sustainable economic and social activities, the Project would also increase&#13;
self-reliance and social capital, facilitating ongoing decentralization efforts and&#13;
strengthening civil society.&#13;
&#13;
26. The Government has already established a social fund (February 2002) to which the&#13;
Bankhas provided technical assistance inthe preparation of the operations manuals and&#13;
has financed some activities through an IDA grant. The Government has requested Bank&#13;
assistance in putting this social fund operation on a more sustainable footing both&#13;
financially andterms o f operational procedures.&#13;
&#13;
27. Needfor emergency assistance. The application o f the Bank's emergency procedures&#13;
under OP 8.50 isjustified bythe needto quickly support the reintegration o fdemobilized&#13;
ex-combatants and their communities, help stabilize society during a critical period for&#13;
regional peace, and consolidate social and economic recovery in the DRC and in the&#13;
region. Without this complementary support to a successful reinsertionprogram, there i s&#13;
a greater danger that disaffected citizens will turnto violence. The importance o f having&#13;
this project processed in parallel with the Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration&#13;
Project was emphasized during the review meeting for that project (October 14,2003). It&#13;
has subsequentlybecome even clearer that the Emergency Social Action Project would&#13;
relieve the pressure from the Government and other donors to over-expand the scope of&#13;
the DDR project to include general community development.                  Thus, simultaneous&#13;
preparation o f a social fund project will make it easier to keep the DDR project clearly&#13;
focused.&#13;

&#13;
2.2   Lessons Learned from Other IDA Projects&#13;
&#13;
28. Social fbnds have provedto be an important tool for channeling funds to the poor for&#13;
self-enhancement activities. The Bank has extensive experience with social funds in&#13;
more than 60 countries worldwide and can call upon a wealth 'of experience on the&#13;
technical requirements.       Lessons learned include the importance o f administrative&#13;
autonomy, close coordination with line ministries, integration into sectoral policies and&#13;
programs, flexible and simple procurement and disbursement requirements, simple but&#13;
rigorous administrative procedures, andhighlevelpolitical support.&#13;
&#13;
29. Project design also draws heavily from the Bank's positive experience inusingsocial&#13;
fund/ CDD approaches inpost-conflict areas (such as Rwanda, East Timor, Afghanistan,&#13;
Cambodia, Colombia, and Burundi), which has shown that involving communities&#13;
directly intheir own reconstruction not only promotes peaceful development but also lays&#13;
solid foundations for reconstruction o f govemance functions as peace takes hold&#13;
throughout the country. Some general lessons for social funds in post-conflict areas&#13;
reflected inthe project design are:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Early delivery of at least some development benefits is more convincing than&#13;
        protracted planning;&#13;
    0   Demand-based programs are less wasteful andmore appreciated than are most top&#13;
        down supply-drivenprograms;&#13;
    0   There i s a need to include marginalized individuals and groups in decision-&#13;
        making and as beneficiaries, but this is better done through having inclusive&#13;
        processesthanbytargeting aid, which can easily fuel future resentment;&#13;
    0   For the project to function well there needs to be strong support from local&#13;
        government, while ensuringthat there i s not elite capture o fproject processes; and&#13;
    0   The importance o f a state presence to help restore and maintain peace in areas o f&#13;
        naturalresource rent seeking.&#13;

3.2    CoverageandImplementationPeriod&#13;
&#13;
31. Targetgroups. The mainbeneficiaries o fthe Project will bepoor communities. The&#13;
Project will include broad coverage o f the country and work in all 11provinces. Zones&#13;
o f intervention will be selected taking into account accessibility and safety, constraints of&#13;
management and supervision o f operations, dynamism o f communities, and existence of&#13;
localpartners.&#13;
&#13;
32. Duration. The Project would be implemented over a period o f four years. The&#13;
plannedcompletiondate is September2008.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.3    ProjectComponents&#13;
&#13;
33. The Project will support a social hnd mechanism that will implement activities in&#13;
infrastructure, income-generation (on a pilot basis), capacity-building, and education. It&#13;
will have the following four components:&#13;
&#13;
Component 1:Infrastructure(US$41.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
A. Community-based initiatives in basic social and economic infrastructure&#13;
(US$29.8 million)&#13;
&#13;
34. This sub-component will provide funding for community-initiated activities basedon&#13;
broad community participation criteria. Sub-projects will be financed across a range of&#13;
sectors including: education and training, health and nutrition, water, micro-irrigation,&#13;
agricultural storage, market and slaughter house construction, rural transport, energy, and&#13;
environmental protection.&#13;
&#13;
35. Sub-projects will be prioritized by beneficiary populations and carried out with the&#13;
intention o f improving their standard o f living and well-being. Sub-project criteria also&#13;
include technical and socio-economic viability, inclusiono f vulnerable groups, maximum&#13;
utilization o f local resources (particularly employment creation), and integration with&#13;
other local development initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
' An ALE is a service provider that can be a national or international non-governmental organization,&#13;
agency o f development o f a bilateral or multilateral program, or UNagency, meeting criteria established in&#13;
the Operations Manual. It i s responsible for sub-project management in partnership with beneficiary&#13;
communities, inparticular, quality and financial oversight.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Social Action Project, Democratic Republic of Congo- TechnicalAnnex                   9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
36. Financing for sub-projects is limited to USD 50,000 for community-based&#13;
infrastructure projects. Community contribution requirements are 10% and can be in&#13;
cash, or in kind. It i s expected that most community contributions will be inthe form o f&#13;
labor.     Contributions help to ensure sub-project sustainability, ownership by the&#13;
community, and that sub-project selection conforms to local priorities.            Beneficiary&#13;
communities are also responsible for all maintenance costs, as well as ensuring that the&#13;
recurrent costs o fthe sub-projects are met, as specified insub-project agreements.&#13;
&#13;
37. This sub-component will also support:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns on specific&#13;
         community-basedprojects;&#13;
    0    Community identification o fneeds andpriorities (e.g. through contracting out o f&#13;
         participatory appraisals);&#13;
    0    Incollaboration withlocalauthorities, soliciting, appraising, approving,&#13;

&#13;
B. Mediumandlarge-scale socialandeconomic infrastructure(US$10.2 million)&#13;
&#13;
38. While the primary focus o f this Project will be on small community-based&#13;
infrastructure, inmany areas o f the country there i s a need for larger and more complex&#13;
projects; bridges, urban markets, water systems, and larger schools and health centers,&#13;
etc, costing more than $50,000 and up to $850,000. This sub-component will provide&#13;
funding for these types o f activities. These projects will serve larger communities, many&#13;
inurban areas, and will require a slightly different set of selection criteria to take into&#13;
account the added complexities involved in designing, building and operating larger&#13;
facilities.   Community consultation and participation, such as involving users in&#13;
identification o f projects and selecting service levels, will be essential to ensure that&#13;
communities feel ownership o f these activities.         Sub-projects will also be developed in&#13;
close collaboration with local andprovincial authorities.&#13;
&#13;
39. Analyses to identifytechnical approaches, community-based mechanisms, and zones&#13;
of intervention for this sub-component will be undertaken during the first six months o f&#13;
Project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
C. Income-generatingactivities (US$l.O million)&#13;
&#13;
40. This sub-component will support pilot income-generating projects. Activities will be&#13;
defined during implementation and may include sub-projects in agriculture, fishing,&#13;
animal husbandry, crafts, and petty trading. The Coordination Unit will sub-contract&#13;
local micro-enterprise organizations to implement these pilot activities and closely&#13;
monitor them. IfsuccessfL1, the pilot activities will be scaled-up, most probably under a&#13;
newproject.&#13;

&#13;
Component2: Capacity-Building(US$2.9 million)&#13;
&#13;
41. This component will enhance the capacity o f the FSRDC's local partners to&#13;
implement andmanage the sub-projects fundedby the Project as described inComponent&#13;
1. It will support capacity-building at the grass-roots and intermediary level through&#13;
information, training and short-term technical assistance to equip beneficiaries with&#13;
organizational, managerial and strategic skills. Training activities will include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  For beneJiciaiy communities: creation andmanagement of associations and sub-&#13;
       project managementteams; sub-project management, including financial&#13;
       management, procurement, monitoring, andmaintenance; andcommunity&#13;
       participation&#13;
    0  For the local executingagencies (ALES,sub-contractors): community&#13;
       participation andmobilization; creation, organization, andmanagement o f&#13;
        community associations; identification, preparation, implementation, monitoring,&#13;

    0   Technical training linkedto sub-project implementationandmaintenance (e.g.,&#13;
        education, health andnutrition, rural transport, energy, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
Component3: Education(US$4.6 million)&#13;
&#13;
42. This component will support the continuation o f two successful education initiatives&#13;
previously undertaken by FSRDC for a period of two years, until a national education&#13;
strategy i s developed:&#13;
&#13;
A. Scholarships(US$3.6 million)&#13;
&#13;
43. A scholarship program, (Bourse d 'Excellence), provides awards to top-performing,&#13;
university-level students based on their state exam scores.              FSRDC will disburse&#13;
approximately 7,000 awards o f $400 each directly to students throughout the country.&#13;
The scholarship amount covers tuition, lodging expenses, and library fees. The program&#13;
i s administered through close coordinationbetween FSRDC, DRC's institutes of higher&#13;
learning, and the Ministry o f Education, which administers the state exams. Awards are&#13;
made on an annual basis and renewed when students pass with distinction. Schools that&#13;
consistently produce students who win scholarships are also given cash awards.&#13;
&#13;
B. LiteracyPrograms(US$l.O million)&#13;
&#13;
44. PROLEDA (Le Projet de Lecture et Alphabe'tisation) establishes community and&#13;
classroom libraries, promotes low-cost literacy activities for children and adults, as well&#13;
as trains teachers and librarians.         Communities must contact FSRDC to request&#13;
consideration for PROLEDA, and priority is given to communities and primary and&#13;
secondary schools in disadvantaged areas that lack library resources. Activities include&#13;
increasing book supplies, reading competitions, book clubs and fairs, television andradio&#13;
programs focused on promoting literacy, and development o f a teachers' guide on&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency SocialAction Project, Democratic Republic of Congo- TechnicalAnnex               11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
literacy and other product development. PROLEDA will also set up a Central Library&#13;
and literacy centre in Kinshasa. Discussions will be held with representatives of the&#13;
MinistryofEducationontheinsertion ofthe programinaforthcomingnationalstrategy&#13;
(see Annex 3 for additional details on these two education initiatives).&#13;
&#13;
Component4: ProjectCoordination,Management,andOutreach(US$14.9 million)&#13;
&#13;
A. ProjectCoordinationandManagement(US$13.9 million)&#13;
&#13;
45. This sub-component includes project coordination and management at the national&#13;
level as well as project execution at the provincial level. It includes the costs of the&#13;
existingUnitat the national level andtwo provincialoffices, inKatanga and Equateur, as&#13;
well as the set up o f nine new provincial offices. It also includes capacity-building for&#13;
FSRDC staff such as techniques for working with communities, ensuring beneficiary&#13;
consultation and participation in the decision-making process, participatory monitoring&#13;
andevaluation, andtargeting.&#13;
&#13;
B. ProjectOutreachand Communication(US$l.O million)&#13;
&#13;
46. This sub-component covers FSRDC outreach andpublicity campaigns at the national&#13;
andprovincial level. Outreach andcommunication activities will draw upon a variety of&#13;
media and information dissemination strategies to inform potential beneficiaries, local&#13;
government, and other stakeholders and partners about the social fund's objectives,&#13;
opportunities, and progress.      These activities will foster open and demand-driven&#13;
competition for participation among beneficiaries as well as local executing agencies&#13;
(ALES), small local contractors, suppliers, and other facilitators of community&#13;
development. By sharinginformationandbroadly disseminating the "rules o f the game,"&#13;
these informationcampaigns help contribute to accountability and transparency inproject&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.4   ProjectCosts&#13;

4   InstitutionalArrangements andProjectImplementation&#13;
&#13;
4.1   InstitutionalStructure&#13;
&#13;
48. The Project will be executedbyLe Fonds Social de la Rkpublique Dkmocratique du&#13;
Congo (FSRDC), a public organization createdby the Government inFebruary 2002. As&#13;
per its statutes, its mission is to improve the living conditions o f the poor by making&#13;
available to communities or groups within communities, the resources - financial and&#13;
human- necessary for implementing self-selected sub-projects. FSRDC structures are&#13;
already established, and since its creation it has successfully executed social fund sub-&#13;
projects amounting to approximately US$5.O million equivalent as well as US$2.0&#13;
million equivalent (provided by IDA) in scholarships for university students. Due to&#13;
discussions during project preparation, the decree establishing the Social Fund will be&#13;
amendedto clarify the roles o fthe different structures outlinedinthe decree.&#13;
&#13;
4.1.I Project Management&#13;
&#13;
49. FSRDC decision-making and oversight i s governed by the following structures at the&#13;
national level:&#13;
&#13;
    6)      Board o f Directors (Conseil d'Administration) - responsibilities include&#13;
            oversight o f the Coordination Unit and approving: manuals o f procedures,&#13;
            annual Project activities and budgets, the creation o f provincial offices, and&#13;
            activity and audit reports. It i s chaired bythe President o f the Republic or his&#13;
            Representative and i s composed o f twelve members, including the Finance&#13;
            Minister, the FSRDC Coordinator, and representatives from the following&#13;
            communities: religious, NGO, private sector, beneficiary, anddonors.&#13;
&#13;
    (ii) CoordinationUnit(BureaudeCoordination)-responsibleforallaspectsof&#13;
           Project management and implementation, under the oversight o f the Board o f&#13;
           Directors.     Responsibilities include coordinating activities and budgets;&#13;
            appraising sub-projects; establishing provincial offices; compiling activity,&#13;
            evaluation, and audit reports; and managing human, technical and financial&#13;
           resources.       The office space in Kinshasa will house both the Project&#13;
           Implementation Unit as well as the Kinshasa provincial office, althoughthese&#13;
           units will b c t i o n independently. The responsibilities of the Coordination&#13;
           Unitare detailed inthe Operations Manual, along with the relationship to the&#13;
           provincial offices.&#13;
&#13;
   (iii)ExternalAuditors,recruitedbytheBoardofDirectors.&#13;
&#13;
50. Provincial oflces. FSRDC currently has a national office inKinshasa (Coordination&#13;
Unit, Bureau de Coordination) and two provincial offices in Katanga and Equateur.&#13;
However, due to the size and objectives o f the Project, the size o f the country, and the&#13;
current state o f infrastructure, autonomous offices at each provincial level will be&#13;
established as quickly as possible to effectively and rapidly respond to community needs.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Social Action Project, Democratic Republic of Congo- TechnicalAnnex               14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To a large extent, decision-making will be carried out at the provincial level, which will&#13;
also help implementation o f the Project to be as cost-effective as feasible. A fiduciary&#13;
capacity assessment will be carried out to determine the most appropriate financial&#13;
management system for the provincial offices.              Equipment and personnel will be&#13;
providedto help eachoffice fulfill its responsibilities effectively.&#13;
&#13;
51. CCPs.       At the provincial level, consultative committees (Comite' Consultatif&#13;
Provincial   - CCP) will be established to provide an advisory opinion on sub-project&#13;
activities in the respective provinces. The CCPs will act as a local volunteer advisory&#13;
board and create a platform for dialogue betweenthe local representatives o f the FSRDC,&#13;
development actors, civil society, and local authorities, helping to ensure a synergy o f&#13;
actions and conformity o f sub-projects with sectoral policies and strategies as well as&#13;
regional priorities. The CCP will be chaired by the FSRDC provincial representative&#13;
(Chef d 'Antenne) and includes representatives from the office o f the Govemor o f the&#13;
Province, the decentralized communities (bourgmestres, administrateurs), socio-&#13;
professional organizations, the Ministry charged with environmental matters, provincial&#13;
offices o f sectoral ministries, and representatives o f vulnerable groups. The CCPs will&#13;
help establish the necessary link between the FSRDC and the sectoral ministries. This&#13;
link is critical to ensure that school and clinics are properly staffed and supported after&#13;
they are built. Sectoral ministries at the provincial level will have to sign-off on sub-&#13;
projectproposals before they are financed byFSRDC.&#13;
&#13;
52. Stafing. The Coordination Unit inKinshasa will be the nationalbase for the Project&#13;
Coordinator as well as the national Finance and Administration Unit, Procurement Unit,&#13;
and a Technical Unit comprised o f an infrastructure, M&amp;E, MIS, and Outreach and&#13;
Communication Units. Each of the 11 Provincial level offices, headed by the Chef&#13;
d'Antenne, will be staffed with infrastructure, community organizing, and accounting&#13;
specialists.&#13;
&#13;
4.1.2 Capacity-Enhancement&#13;
&#13;
53. Inorder to effectively meet the challenges o f the new project, the administrative and&#13;
financial management systems of FSRDC have requiredstrengthening. Regular extemal&#13;
evaluations of past performance have documented areas o f weakness and are verifying&#13;
successfulimplementation o frecommendations.&#13;
&#13;
54. Audit reports in December 2002 and June 2003 identified issues such as the&#13;
nomination o f members to the Board o f Directors; completion/ approval o f manuals o f&#13;
procedures, review by auditors, and adherenceto the manuals; recruitment o fkey FSRDC&#13;
leadership positions in the Coordination Unit; logistical management capacity; human&#13;
resources management capacity for personnel contracts and dossiers; respect o f budget&#13;
lines, accounting, and procurement procedures; appropriate in-house accounting and&#13;
procurement capacity; andprocedures for selecting and evaluating sub-projects.&#13;
&#13;
55. FSRDC has recently undertaken many o f the necessary steps to strengthen its&#13;
implementation capacity in response to identified weaknesses, most notably including&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Social Action Project, Democratic Republic of Congo - TechnicalAnnex              15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
improvements inits accounting system and internal governance procedures. Specialized&#13;
training has also been undertaken to build the capacity o f procurement and information&#13;
management staff. The most recent financial audit conducted in January 2004 verified&#13;
successful resolution o fmanypreviouslyidentified concerns.&#13;
&#13;
56. However, a technical audit carried out in FebruaryiMarch 2004 noted a need for&#13;
FSRDC to step up outreach and communication efforts; develop the Project's provincial&#13;
structures, such as the Comite's Consultatiji Provinciaux (CCP); build capacity in&#13;
formulation, evaluation, and implementation o f sub-projects as well as procurement and&#13;
contracting procedures; and completion, formal adoption, and adherence during&#13;
implementation o f the manuals o f procedures. These measures include the strengthening&#13;
of a comprehensive fi-amework for beneficiary consultation and participationinthe sub-&#13;
project decision-making process as well as robust procedures to ensure transparency and&#13;
accountability in local-decision making bodies. FSRDC is currently working closely&#13;
with the Projectto addressthese issues.&#13;
&#13;
57. At the beginning o f implementation, FSRDC will undertake a comprehensive&#13;
assessment to identify further capacity enhancement needs and prepare an annual plan&#13;
that will be updated throughout the life of the Project. Duringimplementation, additional&#13;
local andor expatriate technical assistance may be required for short- and longer-term&#13;
assignments. Consultancies would be required on an ongoing basis, especially for&#13;
periodic external audits and independent evaluations. Qualified providers would be&#13;
contracted by FSRDC to undertake such activities.&#13;
&#13;
4.1.3 Modalities of Subproject Execution&#13;
&#13;
58. The FSRDC plays primarilya financing, coordinating, and supervisory role. It will&#13;
execute the Project as per the manual of procedures, which has been field tested during&#13;
preparation. For all Project activities, the manuals o f procedures include clearly defined&#13;
mechanisms for beneficiary populations to be informed and strengthened to express their&#13;
needs and formulate proposals, as well as militate against elite capture o f project&#13;
objectives and activities.&#13;
&#13;
59. For social and economic community sub-projects, beneficiary communities will be&#13;
supported to organize community associations that will implement the sub-projects. With&#13;
capacity-enhancement support, the communities will identify their needs and choose an&#13;
Agence Locale d 'Exe'cution (local executing agency - ALE), which will assist them as&#13;
necessaryto prepare their sub-project for presentation to FSRDC.&#13;
&#13;
60. An ALE is a service provider that is a national or international non-governmental&#13;
organization, development agency o f a bilateral or multilateral program, or UN agency.&#13;
Inpartnership with communities, the ALE isresponsible for sub-project management, in&#13;
particular, quality and financial oversight. To serve as an ALE for the Project, an&#13;
organization must meet minimum criteria established in the Operations Manual,&#13;
including legal registration, to allow for the establishment o f a contractual relationship&#13;
with the FSRDC or the communities, technical skill and experience in project&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Social Action Project, Democratic Republic of Congo - TechnicalAnnex               16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
management, financial and procurement capacity and transparency, and a recent external&#13;
audit. Each year FSRDC will invite applications for organizations wishing to serve as&#13;
ALEs, although organizations will also be able to submit their dossiers at any time. An&#13;
FSRDC panel will thoroughly review all submissions to select the most qualified&#13;
applicants and determine absorptive capacity. Remuneration for ALEs is subject to&#13;
specifications laid out inthe Operations Manual, and these costs are a part o f sub-projects&#13;
financed under Component 1. In the absence o f qualified ALE in a given area, a local&#13;
consulting agency with the relevant expertise can be contracted and will assume the&#13;
h c t i o n s o fthe ALE.&#13;
&#13;
61. Inclose partnership with communities, ALEs help communities prepare sub-project&#13;
proposals and ensure they are eligible for financing before submission to FSRDC. After&#13;
analysis and approval of a sub-project by FSRDC, agreements are established between:&#13;
FSRDC, the community association andthe ALE on financing arrangements andbetween&#13;
the ALE and the community association focusing on community management and&#13;
maintenance o f the sub-project., The Commune, Territory, or the Province i s the legal&#13;
owner o f the infrastructure installed on its territory, and, the community must have&#13;
received government commitments in terms of operations and maintenance o f the&#13;
infrastructure sub-project prior to approval by FSRDC.&#13;
&#13;
62. Once the sub-project agreements have been finalized, FSRDC sends funds directly to&#13;
an account managed by the community association.                  Works are executed by the&#13;
community and or through a sub-contractor under the oversight o f the ALE and the&#13;
community as per the financing agreement with FSRDC. Community associations will&#13;
include sub-project management teams (CEP - Cellule de Projet), headedby the leader o f&#13;
the beneficiary association (Reprbsentunt Lbgul de 2'Association), which will be&#13;
responsible for technical follow up of sub-project execution as well as maintenance and&#13;
monitoring. The CEP, numbering less than seven people, will also include a Treasurer,&#13;
Secretary, and representatives who will be responsible for technical aspects o f project&#13;
execution and maintenance. These two representatives will receive appropriate technical&#13;
training andmaybehired for their servicesbythe CEP.&#13;
&#13;
63. Inthe case of the mediumand large-sizedinfrastructuresub-component,FSRDC&#13;
may act as a delegated contract manager and contract out the work with civil works&#13;
enterprises and suppliers. Roles will be defined ina chapter inthe Operations Manual to&#13;
ensure the consultation and participation o f beneficiaries as well as to outline the&#13;
responsibilities of the various parties. Technical and implementation arrangements for&#13;
this sub-component will be finalized during the first six months o f implementation and&#13;
are required for sub-projects to be financed under this sub-component.&#13;
&#13;
64. For capacity-building activities, FSRDC will contract qualified national resource&#13;
persons or public or private institutions to carry them out. At the beginning o f Project&#13;
implementation, FSRDC will undertake a comprehensive assessment o f their local&#13;
partners to identify detailed capacity enhancement needs, capable local groups, and best-&#13;
practice approaches. If necessary, gaps in local capacity will be addressed through&#13;
international technical assistance provided via training-of-trainer programs or other&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Social Action Project, Democratic Republic of Congo- TechnicalAnnex                 17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
targeted methods. FSRDC will evaluate andre-assess their capacity-building program on&#13;
an annual basis.&#13;
&#13;
65. Inthe case o f the education component, FSRDC, functioning through its provincial&#13;
offices, will set up independent selection and implementation committees consisting o f&#13;

services rendered for the implementation o f subprojects Local offices o f the Social Fund&#13;
are currently operating intwo provinces andmore offices will open gradually inthe other&#13;
provinces. One year after effectiveness, a FM specialist will assess the accounting&#13;
capacity in the Provinces and determine their ability to channel funds to beneficiary. If&#13;
the Social Fundlocal offices meet the required FMcriteria, authority to disburse f h d s to&#13;
beneficiaries might be granted and ninety-day advances would be authorized,&#13;
accordingly. Meanwhile, local offices o f the Social Fund will receive monthly cash&#13;
advances not to exceed 60-days. These funds will be used for expenses related to&#13;
operating costs, training and supervision at the local level.&#13;

 4.2.2    Accounting Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
 73. The Accounting Firm.           An internationally recognized accounting firm will be&#13;
 recruited to provide technical assistance to the FM team o f FSRDC, including (i)&#13;
 developing a manual o f administrative, financial and accounting procedures; (ii)&#13;
 assisting in implementing a sound computerized financial management system&#13;
 (budgeting, accounting system, financial reporting) at the central and regional levels; and&#13;
 (iii) thestaff. ThisfirmwouldprovidesupporttotheProjectuntilsuchtimeas&#13;
      training&#13;
 IDA'Sfinancialmanagement staffcertifies that FSRDChassufficient capacity.&#13;
&#13;
 74. Administrative, Financial, and Accounting Procedures Manual. The accounting&#13;
 systems, policies and procedures employed by the Project in accounting and managing&#13;
 for its hnds will be documented in the Project's Financial and Accounting Procedures&#13;
 Manual (FAPM). This will be usedby: staff as a reference manual; IDA and other donors&#13;
 to assess the acceptability o f the Project accounting, reporting and control systems; and&#13;
 by the auditors to assess project accounting systems and controls and in designing&#13;
 specific project audit procedures&#13;
&#13;
 75. Integrated Financial Management System.                For the Project to deliver on its&#13;
 objectives, a Financial Management System (FMS) would be developed. The principal&#13;
 objective o f the FMS will be to support resource management with the purpose o f&#13;
 enswing economic, efficient, and effective delivery o f outputs requiredto achieve project&#13;
 objectives. A financial management Action Plan has been designed to achieve this prior&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Social Action Project, Democratic Republic of Congo- TechnicalAnnex                20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to project effectiveness (see below). The system should integrate budgeting, operating&#13;
and accountingsystems to facilitate monitoring andreporting. System-generatedformats&#13;
for periodic reports would be developed and agreedwith Project management.&#13;
&#13;
76. Specifically, the FMS must be capable o f producingtimely, understandable, relevant&#13;
andreliable financial informationto enablemanagementto plan, implement, monitor and&#13;
appraisethe Project's overall progress towards achievement o f its objectives. Inaddition,&#13;
the Project's M&amp;E system will be an integral part o f the FMS, which will also include a&#13;
cost-accounting framework. The main objective o f the proposed cost-accounting system&#13;
i s to provide management with a well-organized information system to ensure greater&#13;
cost-effectiveness in the use o f public finds in meeting basic social and economic&#13;
infrastructure needs o f the poor. Specifically, the objective i s to (a) provide information&#13;
on the full cost o f implementing sub-projects, including the overheads associated with&#13;
their execution, management, and monitoring; (b) help monitor the cost o f providing&#13;
basic social infrastructure for the poor; (c) develop a framework for implementing cost-&#13;
efficiency measures on an on-going basis; and (d) provide a basis for preparingprojected&#13;
budgets duringproject execution.&#13;
&#13;
4.2.3 ReportingArrangements&#13;

&#13;
  79. Qualified, experienced, and independent external auditors would be appointed on&#13;
  approved terms o f reference. Regular financial and technical external audits will be&#13;
  carried out due to the complexity, risk, and the need for monitoring the performance o f&#13;
  the Project. The external audits would cover all World Bank, other donors, and&#13;
  Counterpart funds at all levels o f Project execution. The financial statements o f the&#13;
  Project would be audited every six months (at least for the two first years of the project)&#13;
  untilperformance is proved to be satisfactory, and annually thereafter. The date of the&#13;
  first  audit would be determined inconsultation with IDA. The first audit would include&#13;
  the periodo fthe PPF&#13;
&#13;
  80. In addition to the audit report, the auditor would be required to prepare a&#13;
  Management Letter where internal control weaknesses and recommendations for&#13;
  improvements, are highlighted. A single audit opinion would be issuedonProject income&#13;
  and expenditures, special accounts and statements o f expenditure. Another audit opinion&#13;
  will be issued on specific controls such as compliance with procurement procedures and&#13;
  FMR requirements and the terms of the grant agreements. The audit reports along with&#13;
  Management Letters would be sent to IDA and all other financing partners not later than&#13;
  four months after the end o f eachpreceding period.&#13;
&#13;
  81. For the sake of comprehensiveness and harmonization o f procedures, Project funds&#13;
  would be administered and audited irrespective o f their source and the financing&#13;
  mechanism employed.&#13;

 the Project to ensure the implementation o f strong financial management systems.&#13;
 Statement o f Expenditure (SOE) reviews would be undertaken where necessary in&#13;
 compliance with World Bankrequirements.&#13;
&#13;
 83. On a semi-annual basis or at such time as the Government and the Bank deem&#13;
 necessary, the Government and IDA would carry out joint supervision missions. These&#13;
 missions would make spot checks on a small random sample o f beneficiaries at their&#13;
 place o fresidence to verifythe use o fthe funds disbursed.&#13;
&#13;
 84. The Project Status Report (PSR) will include a financial management rating for the&#13;
 component by the Country Office Financial Management Specialist following&#13;
 appropriate review.&#13;
&#13;
 4.2.6 RiskAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
 85. In order to establish an acceptable control environment and to mitigate financial&#13;
 management risks, the measures outlined in the Action Plan (above) should be&#13;
 implemented. The Project is highrisk until the FMS and other operational systems are&#13;
 well definedanddocumented, andpersonnel are trained.&#13;
&#13;
 86. Overall assessment. A Bank accredited Financial Management Specialist will review&#13;
 the present status and the agreed actions indicated in the Financial Management Action&#13;
 Plan above. On this basis, IDA will have reasonable assurances for satisfactory financial&#13;
 management o fProject funds inconformity with current IDArequirements. The financial&#13;
 management o f FSRDC would require close follow up. To this end, specialized Bank&#13;
 staff would monitor financial management performance on an ongoingbasis.&#13;

May 2004; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The&#13;
general description o f various items under different expenditure category are described&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
88. The      Grant would         finance     goods    required      for  office   equipment    and&#13;
vehicles/motorcycles for FSRDC, as well as the rehabilitationo f offices andthe purchase&#13;
o f essential equipment.&#13;
&#13;
4.3.1 Procurement CapacityAssessment and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
89. Procurement activities would be handledby FSRDC, including: (i)              preparation o f the&#13;
General Procurement Notice and its annual update; (ii)                 preparation o f the specific&#13;
procurement notices; (iii)      preparation and update o f the six monthly procurement plan;&#13;

requesting for IDA no-objections when required; and (vi) drafting o f contracts and&#13;
ensuringthat contracts are implemented andmanagedproperly.&#13;
&#13;
90. FSRDC has only limited procurement experience. As a result, the Project is&#13;
considered highrisk. The adoption o f a PIM satisfactory to IDA, detailing all aspects o f&#13;
procurement processes, would be a condition o f Grant effectiveness.                Oversight and&#13;
ongoing training by the international accounting firm inthis area during implementation&#13;
i s expected to mitigate this risk..&#13;
&#13;

before Grant effectiveness. It would update the plan every six months for discussion with&#13;
the Bank during supervision missions. Regular Financial Monitoring Reports would&#13;
presentprocurement activities inan appropriate degree o fdetail.&#13;
&#13;
4.3.3 Procurement Methods3&#13;
&#13;
92. Contracts for goods estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent or more, may be&#13;
awardedby International CompetitiveBidding(ICB).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  This sectionhasbeenprepared as per procurement guidelines effective May 2004.&#13;
  The amounts per contract and the aggregate amounts apply to the IDA Grant only.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Social Action Project, Democratic Republic of Congo - TechnicalAnnex             24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
93. For contracts with the commercial bank or other financial firm to handle cash&#13;
payments, single source selection may be usedprovided it i s done with prior approval o f&#13;
the Bank and according to the provisions o f paragraphs 3.8 through 3.11 o f the&#13;
Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
94. Goods estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract may be&#13;
awarded by National Competitive Bidding (NCB) as described inparagraphs 3.3 and 3.4&#13;
of the IDA procurement guidelines. Due to the urgency o f the Project, and in order to&#13;
facilitate its speedy implementation, international and national shopping methods would&#13;
be employed more than is customary in Bank financed projects. Hence, goods not&#13;
exceeding the equivalent o f $50,000 may be procured on the basis o f comparison o f at&#13;
least three quotations at national or international level in accordance with the provisions&#13;
of paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 o f the Guidelines. A sample format for international shopping&#13;
would be includedinthe operations manuals.&#13;
&#13;
95. Goods including vehicles, motorcycles, and computers may be procured through&#13;
United Nations agencies in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 3.9 o f the&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
96. Goods which must be purchased from the original supplier to be compatible with&#13;
existing equipment or, are of proprietary nature may, with IDA'Sprior agreement, be&#13;
procured by direct contracting in accordance with the provisions o f the paragraph 3.7 o f&#13;
the Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
97. Civil works contracts would be very limited in both number and value, hence ICB&#13;
will be infrequent. However, ICB procedures would apply for civil works estimated to&#13;
cost the equivalent o f US$ 1,000,000 or more. Civil works estimated to cost between&#13;
US$ 100,000 and less than US$ 1,000,000 equivalent per contract may be awarded by&#13;
National CompetitiveBidding(NCB) inaccordance with the provisionso fparagraphs 3.3&#13;
and3.4 ofthe Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
98. Consultants' services procured under the Grant would finance the strengthening of&#13;
local institutions responsible for the execution o f the Project: namely, service providers&#13;
such as ALES,as well as beneficiary communities as represented by their community&#13;
associations. The Grant would also finance technical studies in support o f Project&#13;
execution, the monitoring o f components, external financial audits and external project&#13;
evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
99. All consultant services estimated to cost more than US$ 100,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract would be selected using the Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) method.&#13;

4.4     MonitoringandEvaluation&#13;
&#13;
106.      The Monitoring and Evaluation system of FSRDC i s composed of monitoring,&#13;
ex-post evaluation, and technical audits by independent specialists.                             Monitoring will&#13;
include all aspects of FSRDC's annual work program and the operational sub-project&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Social Action Project, Democratic Republic of Congo - TechnicalAnnex               27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
cycle, as well as regular feed back into improving Project design and functioning.&#13;
Drawing upon qualitative and quantitative measures, Project evaluation will focus on the&#13;
implementation o f sub-projects and the degree o f conformity with the established work&#13;
program; economic, social and environmental impacts o f the sub-projects; and&#13;
institutional development - such as on-going beneficiaryparticipation and sustainability.&#13;
Evaluations will also consider potential improvements for FSRDC as well as impact on&#13;
beneficiaries, such as socio-economic conditions and beneficiary capacity to manage and&#13;
sustain sub-projects.&#13;
&#13;
107.    The FSRDC will have a technical audit, the conditions of which are defined in&#13;
more detail in the Project Implementation Manual, each semester (or other period&#13;
determined by the Association) to assess the performance of the Project and to review&#13;
procurement, statements of expenditures, and immobilizations as well as verifying the&#13;
physical existence o f goods, equipments and services acquired throughout the Project, by&#13;
independent technical auditors acceptable to the Association; and&#13;
&#13;
108.     Guidelines for annual and quarterly reports are included in the FSRDC&#13;
Operations Manual. Regularreportingrequirements include outputs such as the number&#13;
of sub-projects implemented; impact andviability o fprojects, such as number o fmenand&#13;
women provided with temporary employment, successful maintenance and utilization o f&#13;
infrastructure; and sub-project disbursements and recurrent cost expenditures. Annual&#13;
and quarterly reports will synthesize information from provincial offices, notably&#13;
concerning the execution o f the annual work program. Other annual reports preparedby&#13;
FSRDC will address environmental impacts and resettlement. The FSRDC will also be&#13;
responsible for a final report with recommendations from the World Bank, finalized six&#13;
months after the end o fthe Project.&#13;
&#13;
109.     A comprehensive management information system (MIS) will be set up in&#13;
FSRDC provincial and central offices.            The provincial offices are responsible for&#13;
operational follow-up, supervision, and monitoring o f sub-projects in their respective&#13;
areas, to which the Bureau de Coordination provides oversight.                 The Bureau de&#13;
Coordination also assures the quality o fthe monitoringprogram, performs internal audits&#13;
andevaluations, as well as coordinates, synthesizes, anddiffuses external evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.5   Project Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
110.     The Project is intendedto help conflict-affected communities return to normalcy&#13;
and make a positive contribution to the socio-economic status and well-being o f&#13;
beneficiary communities. Although the Project will be implemented through a quasi&#13;
independent entity, it will strengthen Government capacities at the provincial and local&#13;
levelfor developing, managing, andmonitoring community development interventions.&#13;
&#13;
111.     Sustainability i s a significant challenge in the current country context and&#13;
inadequate institutional conditions, although critical for the success o f the Project. Steps&#13;
taken to support the sustainability of Project-funded sub-projects include:&#13;

        An assessmento f community commitment andcapacity to ensure local ownership&#13;
        andmotivationto maintainandoperateassets createdwithProject support;&#13;
        Capacity-building and participative processes to strengthen the involvement o f&#13;
        local communities, with special attention to maintenance arrangements (including&#13;
        choice o f simplemaintenance technologies);&#13;
        Community investments in sub-project costs, including community contribution&#13;
        requirements and contracts addressing their maintenance responsibilities signed&#13;
        between the FSRDC and community associations;&#13;
        Prior commitment from the relevant govemment agency to support recurrent&#13;
        expenditures when possible and applicable, as specified inthe agreement between&#13;
        the communities andlocalgovernment representatives; and&#13;
        Capacity-buildingto provide communities with maintenance-related technical and&#13;
        managerial skills.&#13;
&#13;
5    BenefitsandRisks&#13;
&#13;
5.1   Benefits&#13;
&#13;
112.     The Project would help the Government to consolidate the peace process and its&#13;
social and economic recovery efforts, helping conflict-affected communities to return to&#13;
productive social and economic life. The Project will contribute to the restoration o f&#13;
basic public and social services, bringing hope to communities that have been going&#13;
through terrible ordeals inthe past years.&#13;
&#13;
113.     Local communities and vulnerable groups will be empowered by learninghow to&#13;
organize, analyze their needs, identify and evaluate feasible solutions, design sub-projects&#13;
to put into practice such solutions, and manage their implementation. This fostering and&#13;
strengtheningo f community organization is expected to facilitate the emergence o f new&#13;
localleadership that can play an important role instability, peace, and development inthe&#13;
future. Labor-intensive infrastructure projects will generate employment opportunities&#13;
for the rural poor in communities, which are almost demonetized as a result o f the&#13;
conflict.    Employment opportunities are also expected to provide reintegration&#13;
opportunities to former combatants and other young, able-bodied adults who could&#13;
otherwise become a source of insecurityandinstability.&#13;
&#13;
114.    ALEs, the primary interlocutors between the agency and the communities, will&#13;
improve both their internal hctioning and their effectiveness with their clients. This&#13;
strengtheningof the capacity o f ALEs, as well as small local contractors, suppliers, and&#13;
other facilitators o f community development, will support national capacity in&#13;
participatory development. Based on the experiences o f other social funds, the presence&#13;
o f suppliers and contractors inremote areas will be stimulated by the demand created for&#13;
them through the Project. Provincial and local governments will benefit through&#13;
increasedknowledge and capacity for community-based interventions and will be able to&#13;
target their scarceresourcesina more cost-effective manner.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
5.2   Risks and Mitigation Measures&#13;
&#13;
115.    The main country level risk is that of setbacks in the transition process and the&#13;
consolidation ofpeace throughout the region. To the extent that this project successfully&#13;
provides funding to poor communities it will help support the transition to peace.&#13;
&#13;
116.    The mainprojects risks are:&#13;
&#13;
            L o w demandor low capacity to express demand at the community level. This&#13;
            will be addressed through national information campaigns explaining the&#13;
            Project and targeted capacity-building assistance in areas where communities&#13;
            are havingproblems preparingtheir requests.&#13;
&#13;
            Resource/Financial mismanagement problems/cormption or misuse o f funds.&#13;
            Appropriate safeguards with respect to financial management, procurement,&#13;
            and disbursement have been developed to avoid such an abuse of project&#13;
            resources.&#13;
&#13;
            Elite capture, or application of project funds towards local political ends and&#13;
            social exclusion.      Broad-based participation is required for sub-project&#13;
            preparation and implementation; rigorous monitoring,                evaluation, and&#13;
            oversight by ALESandProvincialOffices will also mitigatethis risk.&#13;
&#13;
            Insufficient capacity o f the Social Fund to respond effectively to demands.&#13;
            The Project will include substantial capacity-building inputs and will be&#13;
            closely monitored by the Bank, which has access to considerable expertise in&#13;
            this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.3    Environmental and Social Aspects&#13;
&#13;
117.    The Project is classified as environmental category B. It will support the&#13;
rehabilitation and construction o f community-based, demand-driven infrastructure sub-&#13;
projects, which will include sectors such as education, health, water and sanitation, and&#13;
roads. These sub-projects may have the potential o f some localized environmental and&#13;
social impacts. However, no activity funded under the Project i s expected to have a&#13;
significant negative environmental or social impact. Most investments are either small or&#13;
else they primarily involve the reconstruction and rehabilitationof existing infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
118.    Buildingon lessons from social funds and community reintegrationprograms in&#13;
DRC and elsewhere, the Project contains a number o f specific elements to identify social&#13;
and environmental risks and devise appropriate mitigation measures. These procedures&#13;
andmeasureswill be elaborated inthe Operations Manual. An EnvironmentalandSocial&#13;
Management Framework (ESMF), a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and an&#13;
Indigenous People Development Plan (IPDP) will be prepared by six months after project&#13;
effectiveness and consist o f&#13;

&#13;
a          A screening process to help determine the environmental and social impacts&#13;
     o f the proposed sub-projects and how they will be treated. For instance, (i)         for&#13;
     roads: choice o f the most appropriate alignment; reforestation and protection o f&#13;
     vegetation next to the road; and rehabilitation o f borrow pits; (ii)    for water supply:&#13;
     safety perimeters and fences around wells and water pumps; (iii) healthcenters:&#13;
                                                                             for&#13;
     training o f personnel in the management o f medical waste and construction o f an&#13;
     incinerator; and (iv) for schools: planting o f trees. Some o f these measures can be&#13;
     done by the communities themselves and be counted as their contribution to the&#13;
     sub-project cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0          An assessment of the institutional and human resource capacities o f the&#13;
     stakeholder institutions to conduct environmental management planning and&#13;
     mitigation o f the potential economic and social impacts. FSRDC and its partners&#13;
     will work closely with communities to build awareness on the need for&#13;
     environmental sustainability and promote environmentally sensitive projects. Sub-&#13;
     contractors will beboundbyenvironmental clauses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0          A monitoring planto track potential environmental and social impacts o f the&#13;
     anticipated sub-projects will be included as part o f the overall monitoring and&#13;
     evaluation system. Participatory monitoring and annual evaluations would include&#13;
     an assessment of, among others: the procedures to access land, the occurrence o f&#13;
     involuntary displacement or resettlement, the degree o f community acceptance o f&#13;
     reintegrated members, and the existence o f social discrimination. These evaluations&#13;
     would also determine the appropriateness o f environmental and social procedures&#13;
     andprocesses, andmakerecommendations for improvements where necessary.&#13;

     usage rights issues may arise in sub-project implementation, and suggest&#13;
     appropriate communication mechanisms between FSRDC and indigenous&#13;
     communities to ensure inclusion and participation.             Recommendations will be&#13;
     incorporated into the sub-project screening and monitoring process described&#13;
     above.&#13;

 120.     Analysis of alternatives. The alternative for the implementation o f community&#13;
 development activities would be to use the various line ministries to implement small-&#13;
 scale projects. However, given the weak institutional capacity, this would not likely be&#13;
 successful. Despite the political turmoil o f the recent years, FSRDC has successfully&#13;
implemented social fund operations such as are proposed above (social and economic&#13;
 infrastructure sub-projects amounting to approximately US$5.0 million equivalent as well&#13;
 as US$2.0 million equivalent in scholarships for university students).        Therefore, the&#13;
FSRDC appearsto be the best choice to manage the proposed Project.&#13;
&#13;
 121.      Cost-eflectiveness analysis.     During implementation, the Finance Unit will&#13;
 implement a cost-accounting system to conduct an on-going analysis o f the Project's&#13;
 cost-effectiveness. The assessment will include effective targeting o f project funds to&#13;
poor areas and cost-effectiveness in funds use compared to other similar programs&#13;
 (government, NGOs, donors). At a detailed level, the assessment will include direct&#13;
 labor and materials costs and overhead costs. Data will be entered in, and generated by,&#13;
the MIS, analyzed on an on-going basis, to be reviewed at mid-term and end o f the&#13;
Project. The analysis will also be integratedwith the M&amp;Easpect o f the Project.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Emergency Social
            Action Project is to improve access of the poor to social,
            and economic services, and increase the availability, and
            management of development resources at the community level.
            The Project will contribute to the restoration of basic
            public, and social services, and, help the Government
            consolidate the peace process, and its social and economic
            recovery efforts, helping conflict-affected communities,
            return to productive social and economic life. The
            resumption of hostilities is however, the major external
            risk, while Program specific risks are linked to weak
            implementation capacity.
