            Recent trends in private participation in infrastructure
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Private activity in infrastructure - as
            measured by investment flows to projects with private
            participation - grew dramatically in developing countries
            between 1990 and 1997, from about US$16 billion to US$120
            billion. It then declined by about a fifth to US$95 billion
            in 1998, a result of the Asian financial crisis that began
            in mid-1997. Private activity in 1998, sustained by a US$19
            billion telecommunications privatization in Brazil, remained
            above the 1996 level. Investment over the past eight years
            totaled nearly US$500 billion. Private investment now
            averages about 40 percent of the total for infrastructure in
            developing countries. More goes to telecommunications and
            energy than other sectors, and more to East Asia and Latin
            America than other regions. But almost all developing
            countries have some private activity in infrastructure.
