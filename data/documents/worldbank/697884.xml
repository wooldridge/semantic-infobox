PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Private Sector Background&#13;
1.    During the early to mid-1980s macroeconomic conditions in Ghana have had a pervasive influence&#13;
on the private sector through their effects on the production and investment climate in which private&#13;
producers operate. Not surprisingly, empirical analysis I/ has also shown that uncertainty has caused&#13;
investors to be extremely cautious in their capacity expansion decisions. This includes uncertainty&#13;
regarding future demand, exchange rates, interest rates, inflation and price levels. In the short-run,&#13;
stabilization and adjustment programs increased uncertainty because of devaluation and changes in the&#13;
incentive framework, and thus may have dampened investment. In addition, high interest rates on&#13;
Government paper have attracted capital, at the expense of uncertain, less profitable investments. This&#13;
is thought to be one explanation for the initial drop in private investment in the economy, at least in the&#13;
early years of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP).&#13;
2.    In the latter part of the period (1989-1990), the situation improved with private investment having&#13;
grown from 3.3 percent of GDP in 1988 to 8.4 percent in 1990. Its continued growth, however, has&#13;
been impeded in recent years by macroeconomic uncertainty; in 1993 private investment declined to 4.4&#13;
percent of GDP. While state enterprises continue to dominate the economy, the Government has taken&#13;
measures through the activities of bodies like the Private Sector Advisory Group and Private Sector&#13;
Roundtable to promote private sector development and accelerate the privatization of state-owned&#13;
enterprises (SOEs). The Government's commitment to prudent and stable policies that bear strongly on&#13;
investment decisions such as the exchange rate, monetary policy and the divestiture of public enterprises&#13;
have improved private sector perceptions about Ghana as a place in which to invest.&#13;
3.     Structure. The structure of the Ghanaian private sector is characterized by a preponderance of&#13;
small- to medium-scale enterprises. 2/ Ninety-two percent of the 8,351 Ghanaian enterprises, the total&#13;
number of enterprises enumerated during the 1987 industrial census, were small scale. Medium- and&#13;
large-scale enterprises accounted for only 8 percent of the total number of industrial establishments in the&#13;
country. There were only 52 firms, or 0.6 percent of the total, employing 500 or more workers.&#13;
However, the Government still holds about 25 percent of the medium and large scale enterprises. Such&#13;
enterprises accounted for about 40 and 44 percent of employment and value added, respectively.&#13;
4.     According to the 1987 industrial census, manufacture of wearing apparel (excluding footwear)&#13;
is the leading small scale industrial activity, followed by wood-related industries, food manufacturing,&#13;
shoemaking and shoe repair, manufacture and repair of fabricated metal products, and motor fitting and&#13;
1/    "Technological Capabilities and Industrial Development in Ghana", Draft World Bank Report,&#13;
March 1993.&#13;
2/     With respect to size, manufacturing enterprises in Ghana are classified on the basis of number&#13;
of people employed. In Ghana's Statistical Services's Industrial Statistics, medium and large&#13;
scale enterprises are defined as those employing 30 or more workers; the rest are considered&#13;
as micro and small enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
bodyworks.  Mledium- and large-scale enterprises are found in food processing, beverages, tobacco,&#13;
textiles, wood-related industries, petroleum refining, aluminum and other basic metals, rubber, chemicals&#13;
including pharmaceuticals, plastics, cement and other building materials, and paper and printing. The&#13;
largest enterprises, in terms of value of fixed assets and size of employment, include the Valco aluminum&#13;
smelter, sawmills and timber processing plants, cocoa processing plants, brewing, cement manufacture,&#13;
oil refining, textiles and vehicle assembly.&#13;

5.     The above statistics are only indicative of the current situation of the private sector since in 1987&#13;
the program of divestiture was inaugurated and there has been a progressive shift towards the private&#13;
sector. In the absence of another national survey, at this stage, the new ratios are difficult to quantify,&#13;
but the size of the private sector has clearly increased, and its activities have been diversified.&#13;
6.      Perrormance.  Ghana's manufacturing sector has been characterized by low rates of capacity&#13;
utilization for many years. The average rate of capacity utilization during the period 1970-1977 was in&#13;
the range of 43-52 percent. The utilization rates worsened in the late 1970s and early 1980s as the&#13;
country's ability to import raw materials and spare parts diminished. By 1984 the average capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
utilization had fallen to 18 percent. It rose again in 1985 to 25 percent, in 1987 to 35 percent, and in&#13;
1988 and 1989 appears to have plateaued at about 40 percent as the ERP got underway. Disappointingly,&#13;
however by the start of the decade manufacturing's share of GDP had fallen to 9.2 percent in 1990 from&#13;
11.5 percent in 1985 and an all time high of 14 percent in 1970.&#13;
7.     The reversal of the downward trend in capacity utilization was accomplished through an improved&#13;
business environment and greater availability of resources, especially foreign exchange. Significant and&#13;
continuous increases in utilization have been realized especially in agro-based industries, wood-&#13;
processing, tobacco, beverages, chemicals and non-metallic mineral products. While in 1984 all 16 sub-&#13;
sectors, except one, operated at average rates below 30 percent, in 1989 only three operated at less than&#13;
30 percent, and four were over 50 percent. After years where the lack of foreign exchange was the&#13;
major factor limiting capacity utilization, the main limiting factors now are shortages of credit especially&#13;
long-term, competition from imports that are now readily available, and the generally soft market demand&#13;
and the continued presence of a large group of static, distressed enterprises. Private sector development&#13;
in Ghana remains constrained by the predominant role of public enterprises, continued financial sector&#13;
weakness, limited technological capability of private enterprises, and infrastructure bottlenecks. IDA is&#13;
addressing these constraints through a multi-faceted approach and will focus its private sector lending on&#13;
reforms in the regulatory environment, public enterprise divestiture, and building technological&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
Past Programs and Achievements&#13;
8.     Much of the liberalization and progress achieved in the business environment can be attributed&#13;
to the strong presence of IDA and the World Bank group over the years as summarized in Table 2.2&#13;
below. The World Bank Group has been associated with the industrial sector in Ghana since 1975, when&#13;
it approved its first credit to the National Investment Bank, then Ghana's main development finance&#13;
institution, to encourage the development of mainly domestic resource-based small and medium&#13;
enterprises that were capable of contributing to foreign exchange earnings and savings.&#13;

continuing effort to strengthen&#13;
the overall financial system.&#13;
Most recent credit addressed&#13;
enabling and regulating&#13;
requirement to strengthen&#13;
private sector.&#13;
9.     The credits of the late 1970s and early 1980s focussed mainly on providing foreign exchange and&#13;
stimulating exports to cope with the main impediment then, lack of foreign exchange. While the lines&#13;
of credit were somewhat slow in disbursing due to the severely depressed state of the economy at that&#13;
time, the adjustment credits have been notably successful in laying the groundwork of such key reforms&#13;
as exchange rate and price liberalization, import liberalization, export promotion measures and regulatory&#13;
reform, all of which measures have been sustained by the Government. All this resulted in greater&#13;
availability of foreign exchange for domestic manufacturers; export earnings, especially from non-&#13;
traditional exports, improved; production of locally manufactured goods increased; and project analysis,&#13;
evaluation and supervision capabilities of participating financial institutions and agencies improved.&#13;
Implementation experience under these various projects has been generally good.&#13;
10.    At the end of the 1980s, despite much of the progress throughout the decade, the main issues&#13;
were still an unsatisfactory supply response and an increasingly distressed financial sector. IDA strategy&#13;
focussed on continuing to support reforms and on addressing these issues. The Private Small and&#13;
Medium Enterprise Development Credit of 1989 was to provide credit to finance the short and long term&#13;
credit needs of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), provide equipment lease financing, strengthen&#13;
technical and institutional capabilities of the central bank, the Bank of Ghana (BOG), and train&#13;
participating financial institutions (PFls) in project analysis and term financing. Implementation of the&#13;
project is satisfactory and the objectives of the project are being met. However, sustained lending to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
SMEs rests on high recovery rates which in turn is partly dependent on the banks' capacity to adequately&#13;
appraise and intensiveiy supervise projects.  Given weaknesses ir, these areas, continued technical&#13;
assistance is being provided to train staff in the BOG and participating banks to achieve high recovery&#13;
rates by focusing on implementation problems before they become repayment problems.&#13;
II.    Two financial sector adjustment projects, the First Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FINSAC&#13;
I) in 1988 and the Second Financial Adjustment Credit (FINSAC II) in 1991, were designed to address&#13;
the financial sector distress. The first addressed resource mobilization and credit allocation in the&#13;
financial system as well as improvements in the regulatory framework of the banking system and&#13;
restructuring of distressed banks. The project was also committed to the broadening and deepening of&#13;
the capital markets. The second credit was intended to continue the program to restructure the formerly&#13;
distressed banks and improve their financial and operational performance, pursue the recovery of non-&#13;
performing assets taken over by the Non-Performing Asset Recovery Trust (NPART), created under the&#13;
project, strengthen competition and efficiency within the banking sector through divestiture of public&#13;
ownership in all banks and through rationalization of taxation on bank profits, improve the capacity and&#13;
efficiency of the BOG, prepare for the future development of the financial sector by setting up an&#13;
appropriate institutional framework for non-bank financial institutions by studying the informal markets&#13;
and upgrading the banking, accounting, and insurance professions.&#13;
12.   In 1991, a third sector adjustment credit was approved to promote private investment. This credit&#13;
was aimed at creating an enabling environment for private investment; maintaining macroeconomic&#13;
stability; undertaking tax reform to improve incentives for private investment and savings; taking steps&#13;
to make the regulatory environment in Ghana more consistent with the liberalized economy; making&#13;
further progress on state enterprise reform; and maintaining the momentum of reforms designed to&#13;
increase the efficiency with which public resources are used and thereby enhancing their support of&#13;
private sector development.  Following the initiation of a structured and result-oriented process of&#13;
consultation and active problem solving between the Government and the private sector (through the&#13;
creation of the Private Sector Advisory Group (PSAG)), the environment for meeting the objectives of&#13;
the project has been enhanced as policy, institutional, and regulatory reforms governing the private sector&#13;
were made in compliance with conditions set for the release of the third tranche.&#13;
13.   In 1993, in parallel with the USAID Trade and Investment Project, IDA approved the Private&#13;
Enterprise and Export Development Project as a continuing series of investment credits. As its name&#13;
implies, the primary thrust of this credit (which became effective in December 1993) is to provide support&#13;
to the private sector in its efforts to develop non-traditional exports (NTEs). Through a combination of&#13;
a pre- and post-shipment short term line of credit and export guarantee component as well as a small&#13;
technical assistance component, the credit has as its objective increasing not only the absolute volume of&#13;
NTEs but perhaps even more importantly increasing the export consciousness of the private sector&#13;
through training and capacity building.&#13;
14.   IFC has also played an important role, especially in mobilizing direct foreign investment, in the&#13;
development of the private sector since the initiation of the reforms. It has been particularly active in&#13;
the private financial sector, supporting the development of a private investment bank, Continental&#13;
Acceptance, Ltd., the second discount house, Securities Discount House, and a new leasing company.&#13;
IFC will continue to support the rehabilitation and expansion of gold mining, and locally-based firms in&#13;
the manufacturing and agro-processing sectors. Support for medium scale enterprises will be provided&#13;
through the Africa Enterprise Fund (AEF) and the Africa Project Development Facility (APDF). The&#13;
response of Ghanaian entrepreneurs to the AEF and the APDF has been strong.&#13;

Project Components&#13;
(i) Commercialization of Research and Development (US$6.4 million)&#13;
15.    Overview. Many of Ghana's past technological deficiencies have been caused by an incentive&#13;
structure that was inimical to competition and technological effort. There are now numerous initiatives&#13;
underway to correct these deficiencies such as the enactment in September 1994 of a newly liberalized&#13;
investment code, the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre Act, multilateral and bilateral assistance&#13;
programs aimed at improved marketing and production skills for enterprises, and improved skills and&#13;
training for the financial sector to assist companies with their credit needs. Nevertheless, the evocation&#13;
of a sustainable supply response also depends on the ability of the industrial and manufacturing sectors&#13;
to undertake the necessary technological effort. Technology upgrading will be critical to the future&#13;
growth of industry. If Ghana's manufacturers are to compete with imports, diversify their output, and&#13;
launch into competitive exporting, they will have to utilize new and existing technologies with much&#13;
higher levels of efficiency than in the past and achieve quality standards consistent with overseas&#13;
requirements. Though the relevant equipment and basic technological knowledge will be predominantly&#13;
imported, the acquisition of technological mastery and capacity will be costly, difficult, and protracted&#13;
calling for considerable partnership effort on the part of enterprises as well as the supporting research&#13;
and development (R&amp;D) institutions.&#13;
i6.   It is a striking fact that in Ghana practically all industrial R&amp;D is conducted by public institutions&#13;
rather than by private enterprises. The largest of these is the Council for Scientific and Industrial&#13;
Research (CSIR). The four institutes in its network involved in R&amp;D relevant to manufacturing industry&#13;
and which are the special focus of this project are: the Building and Roads Research Institute (BRRI), the&#13;
Food Research Institute (FRI), the Industrial Research Institute (IRI), and the Scientific Instrumentation&#13;
Center (SIC). While the BRRI's main focus is building and road construction, it also works on problems&#13;
relevant to the building materials industry. The functions of the FRI and the IRI are to develop and&#13;
disseminate technologies for use in manufacturing industry and to conduct technological work on behalf&#13;
of industrial enterprises. The SIC's role is to provide technical support services such as equipment&#13;
calibration and specialized spare parts manufacture to both the CSIR and outside clients.&#13;
17.    Two institutions are responsible for the identification, development and diffusion of intermediate&#13;
technologies for small and micro-enterprises: Development and Application of Intermediate Technologies&#13;
(DAPIT) and Ghana Regional Appropriate Technology Industrial Service (GRATIS). The main function&#13;
of these groups is to encourage the commercial application of known technologies by small- and medium-&#13;
sized enterprises.&#13;
18.    Two other institutions support Ghana's industrial technology. One is the Ghana Atomic Energy&#13;
Commission (GAEC). Its mandate is to pursue the peaceful use of atomic energy, but it has also recently&#13;
started a digital electronics laboratory to provide local repair service for personal computers (PCs) and&#13;
other electronic equipment, interfacing of PCs to machinery for industry, and some custom digital design.&#13;
The other is the University of Science and Technology (UST), Ghana's only engineering school and a&#13;
major source of its trained, technical manpower. It also runs the Technology Consultancy Center (TCC)&#13;
which provides manufacturing extension services to industry and which was the model for GRATIS'&#13;
intermediate technology transfer units (ITTUs).&#13;
19.    The Ghana Standards Board (GSB), also a beneficiary under the project, is responsible for&#13;
drafting and implementing national standards in the country. It has a wide range of responsibilities in-&#13;
cluding food and drug standards, engineered products, materials, building codes, environmental controls,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and others. It operates a mandatory system of product certification under which all manufacturers are&#13;
required by law to have their products certified as being of acceptable quality, along the lines of the&#13;
International Standards Organization (ISO) "System 5."_I! The system has not proven to be workable&#13;
in Ghana in the absence of both resources and published engineering standards. The lack of awareness&#13;
of the ISO 9000 series means that GSB certification has little value in countries that adhere to interna-&#13;
tional standards.&#13;
20.    It is evident that the R&amp;D effort and quality control for and on behalf of industry is insufficient&#13;
to make a significant contribution to the absorption, adaptation, or creation of technology. Apart even&#13;
from the quantity of technological work, there are serious problems concerning its quality and relevance.&#13;
Many reports, official and otherwise, give the impression that the work carried out by the CSIR institutes&#13;
is largely unrelated to the problems facing Ghanaian manufacturing enterprises, and very little of the&#13;
R&amp;D results in commercial application. The quality of the work is variable, and the laboratories are&#13;
generally poorly equipped. While the CSIR provides some useful services to industry, these appear to&#13;
be only a tiny fraction of its activities.&#13;
I/ ISO "System 5" is an intermediate, lower stage set of international standards.&#13;

21.      The most effective way to ensure that the country's science and technology institutions serve&#13;
the needs of industry is to commercialize them -- to insist that each one derive some of its revenues&#13;
4/        Based on 32 sample companies in "Technological Capabilities and Industrial Development in&#13;
Ghana." Draft World Bank report, 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
from work carried out for the private sector. The Government of Ghana agrees that commercializing&#13;
the R&amp;D establishment is a priority, and it has already begun doing so. For example, it has drafted&#13;
a new CSIR law and launched the National Science and Technology Foundation (NASTEF) with&#13;
significant private sector support. In addition, it has changed the compensation system of its science&#13;
and technology institutions so that staff can share in the profits of work they carry out for industry.&#13;
However, a stronger link is still required as the private sector has indicated that its most critical,&#13;
unmet needs are for services which a commercialized R&amp;D establishment could and should provide&#13;
such as a local source of specialized or adapted technologies and spare parts, assistance with quality&#13;
control, and information systems.&#13;
22.    Many other countries, such as Australia, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, and South Africa,&#13;
have commercialized their R&amp;D establishments, and their experiences can be a useful guide for&#13;
Ghana for several reasons. First, their institutions serve the same function -- to provide industry with&#13;
technology. For countries like Australia and the Netherlands, it is high technology. For Ghana, it&#13;
is appropriate or intermediate technology. Second, the CSIR institutions in the British Common-&#13;
wealth, such as those in Australia, India, and South Africa, were all set up around the same time and&#13;
with the same structure and function. More importantly, all of these countries chose commercializa-&#13;
tion as the way to make their R&amp;D establishment responsive to industry's needs. Therefore, their&#13;
experiences can provide valuable insights for Ghana which itself is a Commonwealth country.&#13;
Finally, management at Ghanaian R&amp;D institutions regularly referred to the experience of these other&#13;
countries and saw it as relevant.&#13;
23.    Project Objectives.  While the demand side for technology is being steadily advanced&#13;
through various programs and improved incentives such as a USAID Trade and Investment Project,&#13;
other bilateral donor programs aimed at upgrading manufacturing industries, Govermnent&#13;
liberalization of the Investment Code, and the enactment of sound intellectual property legislation,&#13;
it is clear in Ghana that the institutional supply side is still in need of improvement. The three&#13;
traditional institutional supply building blocks for industrial technology development are skills,&#13;
capital, and information on technology and standards. It is with these categories that this project is&#13;
primarily concerned. It will he the central objective of this component to finance the reorganization&#13;
and focusing of the four industrially-oriented CSIR institutes, the FRI, the IRI, the SIC and the BRRI&#13;
and the GSB along commercially-based lines so as to provide more effectively the linkages with&#13;
regard to the delivery of skills and the development of information and standards to industry. The&#13;
project will not include: DAPIT since its focus is agricultural, its functions could be performed by&#13;
the CSIR, and it is very small; the GAEC since its needs are few; GRATIS since it is already&#13;
receiving significant financing from other donor agencies; and the UST since it is an educational&#13;
institution rather than a provider of technical services to industry.&#13;
24.    CSIR. During preparation of this project, a plan5f was developed for commercialization&#13;
of the CSIR which was reviewed and discussed in depth with the CSIR and the Ministry of&#13;
Environment, Science and Technology (MEST). The plan originally envisaged a three to five year&#13;
implementation program to meet the following objectives:&#13;

25.    Following appraisal, it was felt that its implementation timing should be dictated more by&#13;
events, rather than the calendar; it will take closer to five years than three to complete; and, for the&#13;
Government to achieve its goals for the commercialization of the CSIR, it was agreed that the plan&#13;
would be modified to overcome the following constraints and inefficiencies identified during&#13;
appraisal:&#13;
(i) Lack of business and management skills&#13;
26.    Commercialization will require the CSIR's institutes to identify market needs and to sell work&#13;
and technology to potential clients profitably. Currently, they lack these vital business skills and, in&#13;
particular, do not know their costs while consistently pricing their services below market levels. In&#13;
addition, many have set up pilot plants for processes they have developed and are waiting hopefully&#13;
for an entrepreneur to make a business out of them. Yet, they appear not to have analyzed the&#13;
market before putting resources into this work, and they certainly lack the skills to sell a businessman&#13;
on using a pilot process and then to close a deal. Commercialization will also require the institutes&#13;
to execute work quickly and efficiently. Yet, the CSIR does not appear to have any organized system&#13;
of project review. Instead, research can continue as long as the staff member who initiated the work&#13;
is interested in it, an approach which is too unstructured for a commercialized institution.&#13;
27.    Therefore, as part of its reorganization of the CSIR, the Government, in the body of MEST,&#13;
will have to establish a marketing function in each commercialized institute whose role will be to&#13;
identify market needs and, working with the research staff and finance/accounting, to structure, price,&#13;
and sell services profitably. One person, possibly with some secretarial/clerical support, should be&#13;
able to carry this out at the institute level. In addition, the CSIR Secretariat will need a marketing&#13;
person to coordinate the activities at the institutes and to help sell work which involves more than one&#13;
of them. The marketing person's compensation should be a combination of a modest base salary plus&#13;
a significant commission which could be based on sales or profits and, perhaps, customer satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Once the institute has an operating history and can forecast its revenues to some degree, the marketer&#13;
should have a sales quota to motivate him further and make expliJit how he will be expected to&#13;
perform. In addition, the Government. with expert support, will have to establish a structured project&#13;
management methodology in each institute to ensure proper tracking and timely completion of work.&#13;
(ii) Inadequate incentives&#13;
28.    CSIR staff members assert that their salaries do not provide a living wage and so, to survive,&#13;
they must take on outside duties which they perform during the workday, often at their institute and&#13;
using its resources. As a result, researchers have a strong incentive to sell work directly and keep&#13;
all the revenues rather than share profits with their institute according to the formula which MEST&#13;
has recently established which assigns 70 percent of the profits to whichever party -- the institute or&#13;
the researcher -- brought in the work -- and 30 percent to the other. This saps the strength of the&#13;
institution since it deprives it of both funds and the commitment of its people.&#13;
29.    Therefore, as part of its reorganization of the CSIR, MEST will have to ensure that the&#13;
marketing function is a strong one so that it can regularly bring work into the institute as a whole,&#13;
which will offer a researcher some ongoing incremental income and an incentive to carry the&#13;
assignment out even though it will not get 100 percent of the fee. Strengthening the marketing&#13;
function will also build in checks and balances by separating project sales from performance.&#13;
(iii) Misdirected incentives&#13;
30.    Although research staff at the CSIR can share in consulting fees their work generates, they&#13;
currently get promoted for publishing papers in refereed journals, not for helping industry, which&#13;
diminishes their incentive to serve the private sector.&#13;
31.    To motivate staff to work on problems of importance to the private sector, the CSIR will have&#13;
to revise its promotion criteria to include service to industry. One approach is to give people credit&#13;
for the hours they spend on projects for the private sector. To do this, the CSIR will have to&#13;
establish a time sheet system -- i.e. require that employees account for their time by indicating how&#13;
many hours they spent each week on each particular project. This will also improve the management&#13;
of the CSIR since it will give the Secretariat information on how staff time - its most important re-&#13;
source -- is being used.&#13;
(iv) Inefficient use of equipment and limited absorptive capacity&#13;
32.    Each of the CSIR's institutes claims that it needs new equipment and facilities. While this&#13;
is true to some extent, particularly for facilities, a significant portion of these needs can be met at&#13;
other institutes or related institutions such as the GSB which often have equipment another institute&#13;
wants and do not use it 100 percent of the time. In addition, in those cases where an institute does&#13;
need a major infusion of funds for new equipment, it could not make effective use of them if they&#13;
were all disbursed at one time. One reason is that the commercial activities for which this equipment&#13;
is intended are not yet in full operation. Another is that the staff will require extensive training in&#13;
using the equipment and in research methods before it can fully benefit from it. Finally, installations&#13;
of equipment have to be phased and planned, particularly given the problems Ghanaian institutions&#13;
have had in the past getting equipment to work, thus limiting the rate at which the CSIR can take in&#13;
new gear.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
33.    Therefore, as part of its reorganization of the CSIR and before it receives any funds from&#13;
IDA for equipment, MIEST will have to develop a plan to rationalize equipment allocation and use&#13;
in the CSIR and the GSB. To encourage cooperation and the efficient allocation of resources, each&#13;
machine/equipment center should be made a profit center. For example, the FRI could make use of&#13;
the GSB's analytical services on a contract basis until demand for these services outstripped the&#13;
facilities. Similarly, the FRI and other institutes could contract out work to the SIC's engineer-&#13;
ing/machine shop. While the CSIR may need some new equipment to begin the commercialization&#13;
process, incremental disbursement of funds for equipment must be tied to the achievement of&#13;
milestones such as establishment of satisfactory commercially-based business plans or the achievement&#13;
of agreed upon revenue targets.&#13;
(v) OverstaMng&#13;
34.    The CSIR suffers from overstaffing of its administrative, accounting, and support functions&#13;
which diverts resources from its primary mission and makes the institution harder to manage. For&#13;
example, at the FRI, which had the best ratio, research grade staff still made up only 24 percent of&#13;
its total staff in 1993. At the CSIR as a whole, research grade staff made up only 9percent of total&#13;
staff in 1993.&#13;
35.    Therefore, the Government will have to carry out targeted reductions of administrative,&#13;
accounting, and support manpower. Selectively cutting, redeploying, or retraining staff will free up&#13;
resources for use in research and encourage their efficient use. The targeted reductions envisaged&#13;
for the four institutes are to achieve ratios of 1:4 research to administration staff by end 1995 and&#13;
to achieve a further reduction to 1:3 by January 1, 1998.&#13;
(vi) Legal limitations on its activities&#13;
36.    The Act under which CSIR currently operates significantly limits its ability to serve the&#13;
private sector inasmuch as it is still largely a Government run and directed organization with only&#13;
token private sector representation. MEST has drafted a new bill which restructures the CSIR - the&#13;
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (Amendment) bill. The bill has many good features&#13;
and is a major improvement over the current one. Nevertheless, it does not go far enough to make&#13;
the CSIR a market-driven institution supporting industry.&#13;
37.    During negotiations MEST agreed that the following recommend changes to the draft bill&#13;
which are included in the Letter of Sector Policy will be included in the bill and the accompanying&#13;
memorandum to be submitted to Parliament:&#13;
(a) that by December 31, 1995, 40 percent of CSIR's governing council and 40 percent of&#13;
the management boards of the FRI, IRI, SIC and BRRI would come from the private&#13;
sector;&#13;
(b) that the Director-General of the CSIR be appointed in consultation with the Government&#13;
proposed by the governing Council of the CSIR;&#13;
(c) that contract research be carried out to meet the needs of industry;&#13;
(d) that not less than 70 percent of the contract income go to the institute that did the work;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
(e) that the sectoral research committees explicitly represent industry interests and the&#13;
relevant CSIR institutes have a marketing function in place to serve the industries in their&#13;
respective sectors; and,&#13;
(f) that the Director of an institute has more freedom of action and responsibility.&#13;
38.    GSB. With the end of the era of import substitution and the emphasis on export promotion,&#13;
Ghana's manufacturers desperately need help to raise quality standards to a uniformly high level, one&#13;
that is acceptable to overseas customers. Although the GSB has already made efforts to promote&#13;
quality awareness, it will need to overcome constraints identified during appraisal, the most important&#13;
of which are:&#13;
(i) Poor image&#13;
39.    The GSB has a dual rule -- to set and enforce standards and to assist industry in improving&#13;
quality. On the whole, however, the private sector sees the GSB only as a tough regulator and is&#13;
reluctant to approach it for help. This hurts industry, since the GSB is the primary repository of&#13;
knowledge about quality control in Ghana, and prevents the country from deriving full benefit from&#13;
its investment in the GSB.&#13;
40.    Therefore, as part of its strengthening of the GSB, the Government, through MTI, will have&#13;
to create a strong public relations/marketing function there. Its purpose will be to generate awareness&#13;
among industry of the importance of quality and of the willingness and ability of the GSB to provide&#13;
assistance in that area. The MTI should also be prepared to make any other changes in the GSB's&#13;
structure and culture which are necessary to make the organization more "user friendly."&#13;
41.    "User friendliness" should not be limited to industry. The MTI must ensure that the GSB&#13;
shares its equipment with other research institutions to maximize use of the country's limited&#13;
resources. For example, the GSB has three ultraviolet spectrophotometers which, like much of its&#13;
equipment, are not used full-time. If the FRI could have access to one of them, it would not need&#13;
one of its own.  Making machine/equipment centers into profit centers, as in the CSIR, will&#13;
encourage sharing.&#13;
(ii) Inward focus&#13;
42.    The GSB creates its standards to protect domestic consumers. As a result, its certification&#13;
has little value in countries that adhere to international standards, hurting exporters.&#13;
43.    Therefore, the principal challenge to the GSB is to begin the process of getting Ghana onto&#13;
the ladder of accreditation towards the ultimate achievement of ISO 9000, which is critical to industry&#13;
as it enters the global marketplace. One important initial step the GSB can take towards this goal will&#13;
be to convene its standards committees to examine its existing standards and determine how to&#13;
upgrade them to international levels. Twinning and consultancy arrangements with other international&#13;
CSIR and standards establishments should help in this entire process. First contacts have been&#13;
established.&#13;
44.    Project Description. With the intention of developing a more competitive and demand-&#13;
driven industrial technology development culture in Ghana, the project will provide technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
stance for training and twinning arrangements to the CSIR with other international CSIR&#13;
rganizations to develop a commercialization strategy for the four institutes that are serving the needs&#13;
of the private sector. In addition, the GSB, an integral part of any capacity building in technology,&#13;
will receive support to strengthen its role in developing metrology and quality testing standards and&#13;
to disseminate its services throughout the country. For this project component, US$7.1 million&#13;
equivalent will be allocated to help upgrade the activities of the CSIR institutes and GSB through the&#13;
provision of:  (a) consultant services and training for management, accounting and institutional&#13;
upgrading and strengthening the commercial marketing and sales function (US$2 million equivalent);&#13;
and (b) equipment and support facilities (US$5. 1 million equivalent). The Implementation Manual,&#13;
Section 1, provides the terms of reference for the consultants who will assist in the commercialization&#13;
of the CSIR and GSB.&#13;
45.    Consulting services will be made available to the CSIR institutes and GSB to assist them in:&#13;
surveying industry needs, determining the customer base and defining the necessary equipment,&#13;
facilities, and training and skills required to effectively respond to these needs; assessing each&#13;
institute's strengths and weaknesses; reviewing business plans; developing and implementing revised&#13;
management structure and procedures; establishing a commercial marketing and sales function;&#13;
developing a methodology for forecasting external revenue; developing a rationalization plan for&#13;
equipment which enforces sharing and establishes usage targets; and setting up accounting and&#13;
budgeting procedures and information and data systems. In addition, for GSB, consultants will assist&#13;
in: identifying industry sectors which GSB will need to provide standards; setting targets for products&#13;
to be certified; reviewing current standards and developing a plan for converting them to ISO&#13;
standards; and defining the role and need for regional offices. Also, twinning arrangements, with&#13;
other worldwide institutes, exchanges of senior staff, assessment and counseling by technical&#13;
specialists, open informal communications between international counterparts, and participation in&#13;
seminars and other fora would be used as vehicles to transfer managerial skills and experience and&#13;
upgrade the capacity of these institutes and GSB to plan strategically, market and provide services&#13;
effectively, and develop international standards.&#13;
46.    To enable the CSTR institutes and GSB to strengthen their technical support and 'user-&#13;
friendly' services functions, assistance will be provided in the form of equipment over the five-year&#13;
project implementation period. Disbursement allocations for equipment will be based on annual&#13;
rationalization and acquisition plans which reflect shared and effective usage of equipment and&#13;
responsiveness to established commercial targets.&#13;
47.    Project Implementation. The Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology (MEST)&#13;
will be the principal implementing agency for this component to commercialize the four CSIR&#13;
institutes and strengthen the role of GSB in providing quality assurance services for the private sector.&#13;
48.    MEST has already embarked on the early stages of a commercialization effort, and the&#13;
discussions held with it and the CSIR have confirmed their commitment to continuing the process&#13;
with support under this project. To that end, they have, in principle, accepted the plan being&#13;
proposed. During negotiations, MEST provided a draft Letter of Sector Policy which, inter alia, will&#13;
incorporate an acceptance of the changes proposed to the draft amended CSIR bill. This was&#13;
finalized prior to Board presentation. The conditions for effectiveness include: (i) approval by the&#13;
Cabinet for submission to Parliament of a bill, satisfactory to the Association, enhancing the&#13;
commercial nature of CSIR's operations; (ii) submission of a model plan for each CSIR institute,&#13;
acceptable to IDA, detailing the staff reduction targets necessary to achieve the ratio of&#13;
support/administrative staff to research/technical staff of 4:1 by January 1, 1996 and to 3:1 by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
January 1, 1998; Prior to being eligible to receive assistance for equipment, each CSIR institute will&#13;
be required to demonstrate progress made in the commercialization process and GSB will have to&#13;
exhibit headway in achieving ISO  9000 accreditation.  Conditions for disbursement against&#13;
expenditures for eguipment are: (i) Each of the four institutes will have developed a business plan&#13;
which inter alia will contain (a) a marketing plan, (b) a needs assessment schedule of training and (c)&#13;
written and monitorable project management procedures. The GSB will have developed a business&#13;
plan which will include (a) procedures and timetables for developing its levels of accreditation&#13;
towards the achievement of ISO 9000 standards and (b) industry targets and timetables for providing&#13;
service and information on metrology and standards. (ii) The CSIR Secretariat, the four institutes&#13;
and the GSB will have each appointed marketing managers. The marketing manager at the Secretariat&#13;
will have the responsibility of coordinating and monitoring the marketing functions of the institutes&#13;
and liaising with the GSB on equipment sharing issues. (iii) Each of the institutes will have adopted&#13;
plans, acceptable to IDA, detailing the reductions of administrative/support staff to research/technical&#13;
staff ratios commencing at 4:1 by January 1, 1996 and reducing to 3:1 by January 1, 1998. (iv) In&#13;
cooperation with the CSIR Secretariat, each institute and the GSB will have agreed upon a&#13;
rationalization plan for equipment based on the inter-institutional sharing of such equipment and on&#13;
agreed usage targets.&#13;
49.    Each of the four CSIR institutes and GSB will be required to submit semi-annual progress&#13;
reports to MEST and IDA. The CSIR progress repons will address achievements/shortcomings in&#13;
meeting its business objectives and will document the market studies conducted and actions taken to&#13;
respond to market demands; experience in meeting commercial revenue targets; progress on targeted&#13;
staff reductions in the administrative, accounting and support areas; and improvements in the&#13;
incentive system. GSB will also document its experience in meeting business goals and will include&#13;
in its semi-annual progress report actions to: strengthen its public relations and marketing function;&#13;
identify industry sectors to provide standards and progress made to convert to ISO standards; and&#13;
rationalize its regional offices. The CSIR institutes and GSB will also include their projected&#13;
equipment requirements supported by an equipment rationalization plan.&#13;
(ii) Technology and Enterprise Development Fund (US$2.5 million)&#13;
50.    Overview. While the Government is strongly committed to supporting a range of initiatives&#13;
that will increase and accelerate the future growth of the economy, the financial and private sectors&#13;
in Ghana remain very fragile because: (a) the continued overhang of a large public sector contributes&#13;
to sustaining an environment of limited growth in the private sector as a whole and in the private&#13;
export sector in particular; (b) the restructuring of the banks and a tighter supervisory climate have&#13;
still to create the necessary degree of self confidence within the financial establishment to respond&#13;
more forcefully and creatively to the needs of the private sector; and (c) companies are unable to plan&#13;
or communicate their needs to their banks who in turn are inflexible in dealing with the needs and&#13;
problems of such companies. Firm-level constraints that continue to impact the competitiveness of&#13;
companies in the local economy and in international markets are:&#13;
(a) Existing management and entrepreneurial skills are those that were developed to serve&#13;
an economy where quality control, financial management, pricing and marketing were&#13;
not major concerns. The needs, managements skills, marketing and information systems&#13;
required for the local and international markets are dramatically different;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
(b) Operating capacities and productivity are low, a situation related to historically low labor&#13;
costs, work practices stemming from labor hoarding and the limited access to modern&#13;
technology;&#13;
(c) Technology used by most private sector enterprises is aging and outmoded;&#13;
(d) Established business practices and expectations are not compatible with the demands of&#13;
the international markets.&#13;
In this environment there is a need to create catalytic forces to spark the necessary initiatives needed&#13;
to develop an ongoing and sustainable capacity among financial institutions and their corporate clients&#13;
to respond to consumer demands.&#13;
51.    Objectives and Description. The objective of the Technology and Enterprise Development&#13;
Fund (TEDF) would be to: (i) assist the private sector to increase and deepen its contribution to the&#13;
growth of the country's economy by strengthening and broadening its overall technological and&#13;
productive capacity to enable it to competitively participate in the global economy; (ii) create a&#13;
number of new and/or higher level technical jobs; and, (iii) further develop the local consulting&#13;
industry. Specifically, on a pilot basis, US$3.3 million will be allocated to provide consulting&#13;
services on a competitive basis to: (i) assist enterprises in increasing their efficiency to develop value-&#13;
added products and provide reliable services; (ii) provide assistance in areas including, but not limited&#13;
to, project conception; preparation of feasibility studies; operational and financial management;&#13;
improving product quality, uniformity, reliability, design and delivery; marketing; technology&#13;
advisory services; enterprise restructuring; and personnel management, training and incentive&#13;
systems; and (iii) help enterprises in accessing funds from the financial sector.&#13;
52.   Implementation. The TEDF would be implemented under a TEDF Framework Agreement&#13;
between MTI and Empretec Ghana Foundation (EMPRETEC), a private, registered, non-profit&#13;
company. EMPRETEC was set up in 1990 and funded by the United Nations Development Program,&#13;
the UK Overseas Development Administration (ODA), Barclays Bank of Ghana Ltd. and the National&#13;
Board for Small Scale Industries to support the development of private small and medium enterprises.&#13;
For the past three years EMPRETEC has been successfully implementing its programs which focus&#13;
on business development and include management training and business advisory services, promoting&#13;
international linkages, providing a loan monitoring service to increase the flow of bank financing to&#13;
SMEs, procurement service and volunteer (British Executive Service Overseas) technical short-term&#13;
consulting services. Since its inception total assistance to EMPRETEC for their programs from both&#13;
ODA and the European Union (EU) (for a Business Plan Development Fund) amounts to&#13;
approximately US$3 million. To qualify for continued support from ODA, EMPRETEC had to&#13;
establish itself as a limited liability company and attain independent status. EMPRETEC is working&#13;
toward these goals and on September 1, 1994 was incorporated as a foundation with its own board&#13;
of directors. EMPRETEC's Accra office and two regional offices (in Kumasi and Takoradi) are&#13;
supported by a total of eleven professionals and eight office support staff.&#13;
53.   Building on initiatives made by ODA, the EU, and the donor community for SMEs, funds&#13;
will be allocated under the project to augment EMPRETEC's limited resources to broaden and&#13;
strengthen their ability to provide business and technology advisory services.  The main&#13;
responsibilities of the staff would be to: assist beneficiaries in preparing clear and precise terms of&#13;
reference, find qualified consultants to provide the required services, determine deliverables that will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
confirm services have been provided and serve to demonstrate the extent of the impact of the scheme;&#13;
prepare contracts with consultants and beneficiaries; monitor and evaluate consultant support; promote&#13;
the scheme by providing the media and other private sector organizations with general information&#13;
on the support provided by EMPRETEC's TEDF program; build a consultant register; establish links&#13;
with financial institutions, professional organizations, the Chamber of Commerce, trade associations,&#13;
and government authorities; assist in matching the beneficiaries with funding sources either through&#13;
bank loans, joint ventures, special account partnerships, or other financial relationships when financial&#13;
resources are required by the beneficiaries; evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme; and recommend&#13;
to its Board, MTI and IDA changes in policy or procedures to ensure the objectives of the scheme&#13;
are met. EMPRETEC staff will be guided by a Procedures Manual which will define the operating&#13;
policies and procedures for TEDF.  Modifications to the manual would be possible only after&#13;
obtaining approval from EMPRETEC's Board, MTI and IDA. The Implementation Manual, Section&#13;
II, provides a description of the Framework Agreement and the Procedures Manual.&#13;
54.   The fund is intended for beneficiaries who are:  privately-owned (at least 51 percent),&#13;
registered companies owned by Ghanaian nationals and, on an exceptional basis, firms having below&#13;
20 percent foreign participation; firms with asset size or projected annual sales not exceeding&#13;
US$400,000; engaged in the local productive and service sectors (primary agriculture, trading or real&#13;
estate are excluded); firms that do not belong to the Africa Project Development Facility's client&#13;
group, i.e. beneficiaries seeking assistance in obtaining financing up to US$250,000 in new, expanded&#13;
or restructured credit or for technical assistance support unrelated to direct credit needs; and,&#13;
financially capable of making their mandatory contribution to the financing of the consultancy&#13;
services. EMPRETEC will be required to seek IDA approval for the first 10 applications and all&#13;
other applications requiring consulting services costing US$20,000 and above before notifying&#13;
applicants of their decision to assist the enterprise.&#13;
55.    During the five year project implementation period, the provision of consultancy services will&#13;
be on a cost-sharing basis with 50 percent borne by the beneficiary and the remaining 50 percent as&#13;
grant support from TEDF. Experience with this type of technical assistance programs shows that&#13;
recipients are much more committed and interested in the successful outcome of the assistance if they&#13;
are required to participate in its cost. In addition, the beneficiaries will pay EMPRETEC a service&#13;
fee of 5 percent of the gross amount of each signed consulting agreement in the first year and&#13;
escalated thereafter by I percent per annum. The following Table provides projections on assistance&#13;
provided and cost recovery performance of EMPRETEC.&#13;

56.    As indicated in the above table, $3.3 million will finance consulting services to beneficiary&#13;
enterprises, of which $1.9 million will be financed by IDA, $0.3 million by the Government and $1.1&#13;
million from beneficiary contributions. The service fee could be allocated to support operating costs and&#13;
an incentive compensation package approved by the Board and IDA. The management fee will include all&#13;
staff salaries, overnight travel allowances, vehicle running costs, outreach and advertising costs, and all&#13;
contributions to overheads and miscellaneous operating costs. The project will support the training needs&#13;
of both EMPRETEC staff and consultants in EMPRETEC's roster to deepen their professional skills in&#13;
providing business and technical advisory services.&#13;
57.    Beneficiaries would be required to take the initiative to procure the consultancy services, and with&#13;
the assistance of EMPRETEC, match their needs with appropriate expertise and select their own consultants&#13;
from a roster of qualified consultants. Repeated use of the scheme would be allowed provided cumulative&#13;
assistance from the fund does not exceed US$40,000 per beneficiary. No expenditures on equipment can&#13;
be supported by EMPRETEC even where equipment purchases are recommended by the consultant.&#13;
58.    A letter of understanding will bind the beneficiary to deposit his/her mandatory contribution of the&#13;
consulting and service fees with EMPRETEC. Also, grant recipients will be expected to define in this letter&#13;
of understanding at least one deliverable per contract which will allow EMPRETEC to verify that the&#13;
consulting activity had taken place.  A defined deliverable would depend on the circumstances of the&#13;
qualifying activity and could, for example, consist of a new and up-to-date accounting ledger, a new quality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
manual, implementation of a new training program on operating new equipment, or a production prototype&#13;
of a new product line. EMPRETEC will assist its client firms in defining suitable deliverables ensuring that&#13;
such deliverables are indeed beneficial to the firm rather than produced merely for the benefit of the scheme.&#13;
Deliverables should be available to the company for viewing and need not be taken off a client's premises,&#13;
photographed or copied. All outputs from the consulting activities will remain the exclusive property of the&#13;
beneficiary with commercial confidentiality fully preserved by EMPRETEC.&#13;
59.    Consultants will be required to register with EMPRETEC to be eligible to provide services under&#13;
the scheme. Consultants and consulting firms will be required to provide information and demonstrate their&#13;
expertise in the field they are registered under. Consultants who fail to perform will be excluded from&#13;
EMPRETEC's roster and may be reinstated following EMPRETEC's review and only after a year. With&#13;
capacity building in the consulting services industry as another objective of the fund, preference will be&#13;
placed on hiring local consultants. In addition, resources will be allocated to provide EMPRETEC staff and&#13;
local consultants in EMPRETEC's roster with training to deepen their technical skills. The consultants will&#13;
be expected to pay at least 50 percent of their training costs.&#13;
60.    EMPRETEC will regularly promote the scheme using multi-media means.  To promote the&#13;
demonstration effects of the scheme, EMPRETEC staff will make available to the local media on at least a&#13;
quarterly basis, by form of press release the number and type of support, by product or service feature,&#13;
received from the scheme. This public information will be of a general nature to preserve the confidentiality&#13;
of individual clients.&#13;
61.    Regular monitoring and evaluation of EMPRETEC's operations will be required. Semi-annual&#13;
progress reports will be submitted to its Board, MTI and IDA.  Progress reports will document&#13;
implementation experience on each contract covering the deliverables by beneficiaries, consultant's statement&#13;
of services and its own on-site supervision. Before the end of each reporting period, EMPRETEC will file&#13;
an activities report with MTI for the period just ended using a standard summary format and providing&#13;
information on: the number and type of applications received, rejected and supported; breakdown of&#13;
approvals by manufacturing and service sectors, size of firm, feature of support received (e.g., quality,&#13;
productivity, management, etc.), size of the grant and beneficiary financing for consulting services; number&#13;
of site visits of each team member; disbursement performance; examination of operating costs versus budgets&#13;
by line item; marketing strategy; an assessment of the effectiveness and impact of the scheme; and project&#13;
implementation issues. A review of the management and financial performance of the fund will be&#13;
undertaken semi-annually during its first year of operations and annually thereafter. IDA will conduct at&#13;
least semi-annual supervision missions and a mid-term project review. Reports from these reviews will&#13;
provide a resource for evaluating the performance of the scheme and justifying its continued support under&#13;
the project following the mid-term review.&#13;
62.    Following the mid-term review, continued support for EMPRETEC's TEDF operations will be&#13;
dependent upon a satisfactory assessment by the Government and IDA of EMPRETEC's record on meeting&#13;
its obligations. By the mid-term review EMPRETEC would be required to have carried out with due&#13;
diligence and efficiency the following: (i) written at least 70 contracts for beneficiaries; and (ii) implemented&#13;
and/or completed at least 50 percent of these contracts. The assessment will also cover EMPRETEC's&#13;
compliance with the requirements as stipulated in the Procedures Manual.&#13;
63.    Prior to negotiations a letter mandating EMPRETEC to administer and manage the TEDF was sent&#13;
by MFEP to IDA and a letter from EMPRETEC confirming their acceptance was received. A Project&#13;
Preparation Facility (PPF) was put in place to provide for consulting services to prepare the Framework&#13;
Agreement and prepare the final draft of the Procedures Manual. Conditions for effectiveness include: (i)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
signing of a framework agreement, between the Borrower and EMPRETEC; and (ii) adoption by&#13;
EMPRETEC of a procedures manual, both satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
(iii) Rehabilitation and Commercialization of the Ghana Trade Fair Authority (US$950,000)&#13;
64.    Overview.    Originally constructed in 1964 as a project financed by the Czechoslovakian&#13;
government, the Ghana Trade Fair Authority (GTFA) occupies some 50 hectares of land about 10 kilometers&#13;
from the center of Accra and within easy reach of the international airport and the port of Tema. The trade&#13;
fair center offers seven exhibition halls and a large, central air-conditioned 250-seat conference hall which&#13;
can be hired out for a variety of functions. The center is well provided for in terms of communications and&#13;
other facilities.&#13;
65.    While the GTFA hosted many international and local trade fairs in its early years, there has been&#13;
a distinct reduction in its role in the crucial task of promoting Ghana's image as an international trading&#13;
partner. The hosting of the Indutech Fair in 1993 was the first international fair in seventeen years.&#13;
66.    In 1991, the GTFA had published a three year plan which included the erection of perimeter walls,&#13;
the rehabilitation of the electrical system, the construction of a Financial Institutions Pavilion, improvement&#13;
of the internal roads and a general beautification program. However, while a Government task force&#13;
recommended a capital budget of Cedis 920 million to fulfill this program, only a third was allocated. The&#13;
net effect was that, due to these constraints, much of the 1991-93 plan could not be completed. It is thus&#13;
against this background that a new 1994-96 plan has been prepared to overcome the capital constraints and&#13;
provide for a strategy of sustainable growth for the foreseeable future.&#13;
67.    That plan has developed a mission statement that provides that the GTFA, in pursuit of the national&#13;
policy of boosting Ghana's internal and external trade, will marshall its resources to commercially engage&#13;
in effective trade promotion for Ghanaian entrepreneurs. In this process, the GTFA will complete the&#13;
development of the Center to an internationally competitive standard and effectively utilize all its facilities&#13;
for viable economic ventures.  To implement this mission the following corporate objectives were&#13;
established:&#13;
(a) support the national policy of private and export-led development;&#13;
(b) mobilize the resources necessary to meet the mission objectives;&#13;
(c) rehabilitate the Center to enable the GTFA to host local, sub-regional, regional and international&#13;
exhibitions;&#13;
(d) increase the volume of trade exhibitions;&#13;
(e) lease Center space for commercial activities; and&#13;
(e initiate new development projects.&#13;
Concerns were raised, however, that not only should the GTFA be placed on a sustainable commercial basis,&#13;
but that any costs towards its rehabilitation would have to be closely allied to the GTFA's ability to generate&#13;
sufficient revenues from a totally reorganized entity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
68.    Discussions were conducted between IDA staff and a number of Government agencies, private sector&#13;
organizations, and trade associations to determine their interest and support in strengthening GTFA's role&#13;
as a central, commercially-based trade promotion and exhibition facility. There was general agreement for&#13;
such a facility and that GTFA should fulfill the role. Also, there was consensus among those interviewed&#13;
that much work had to be done to enable GTFA to run, on a commercial basis, a first class, international&#13;
trade and business center including construction of new buildings or rehabilitation of the existing pavilions,&#13;
and adoption of new operational, financial and marketing management policies and procedures. It was&#13;
agreed during appraisal that detailed diagnostic studies would be conducted to determine the viability of such&#13;
a facility so as to ensure that costs towards the rehabilitation of GTFA are associated with expected revenues&#13;
from its activities.&#13;
69.    Objectives and Description. Under the project, funding amounting to approximately $950,000&#13;
would finance consultancy services for two studies and implementation of the recommendations under the&#13;
studies, satisfactory to IDA and the Government, including rehabilitation and construction work. The first&#13;
study should determine, among others: the market demand, domestically and internationally, for such a&#13;
facility; formulation of a promotional plan that will support both the national objective of a private-led export&#13;
development center as well as a sustainable commercially-based operations; propose a precise action plan&#13;
of reorganization leading to a privately managed commercially-based strategy for the center; the level of&#13;
support and the type of revenue generating activities (e.g., organizing pop concerts, accommodating&#13;
conferences, trade union meetings, sports events, etc.) to run the facility on a commercial basis; the changes&#13;
required in the operational, financial and marketing management strategy and structure to aggressively run&#13;
a market-oriented, international exhibition and business center; the receptivity of key agencies and business&#13;
support facilities such as the Ghana Export Promotion Center, Association of Ghanaian Industries, Federated&#13;
Association of Ghanaian Exporters, trade associations, banks, communications centers to set up their offices&#13;
on the premises on a rental basis to provide GTFA's patrons with a responsive business center; the&#13;
possibility of moving the Arts Center to the GTFA site; and options available to GTFA, including donations&#13;
from developed countries, to acquire exhibition furniture such as aluminum, knock down, shell scheme&#13;
systems.&#13;
70.    The second study, an engineering and architectural survey, will assess the rehabilitation and redesign&#13;
needs of the pavilions on the GTFA site to establish the investment parameters for this central trade&#13;
promotion and exhibition center. The Implementation Manual, Section 3, provides the terms of reference&#13;
for the two studies under this project component.&#13;
71.   The support for rehabilitation and construction work under the project is contingent upon (i) the&#13;
completion of the two studies described above establishing the commercial feasibility of the GTFA; and, (ii)&#13;
the adoption of a restructuring plan for the GTFA satisfactory to the Government and IDA.&#13;
72.    Project Implementation. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in conjunction with the GTFA&#13;
will be responsible for this project component. A condition for disbursement for civil works would be the&#13;
preparation of financing and action plans for GTFA's privately-managed commercial operations satisfactory&#13;
to IDA.&#13;
(iv) Industrial Design Center (US$750,000)&#13;
73.    Overview.  While it has been well established within the literature on the subject that the level of&#13;
technological capacity within a country is a key component in the process of economic development, it is&#13;
perhaps less established or discussed as to the extent that industrial design also plays a fundamental part.&#13;
Industrial design is that part of the technological process that more precisely defines the product's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
acceptability into the market. A fine piece of technology or a well prepared traditional product without&#13;
market acceptance is unlikely to gain the acceptance that internationally recognizable brand names already&#13;
enjoy. At a much smaller and more modest level, local manufacturers, hoping to attract the attention of&#13;
international buyers, have to recognize that their products are being judged in relative terms to the&#13;
established brands and they have to address this problem through the adoption and exploitation of better&#13;
industrial design.&#13;
74.    Ghana today appears to be in this position. Its range of domestically produced products are in&#13;
serious need of upgrading. While there is a clear creative potential within the market, the products are&#13;
characterized by a number of fundamental flaws. These include such problems as non-colorfast fabrics, non-&#13;
kiln-dryed wood products, repetitive traditional designs, poor adaptation of traditional products to&#13;
international tastes, artisanal finishes to fabrics and wood products, including furniture, dated designs, limited&#13;
lines and poor, unimaginative packaging. In all cases, there is a strong case to be made for the introduction&#13;
to the market of improved and sophisticated industrial design innovation.&#13;
75.    Ghana's internationally traded goods are basically divided between its traditional products which are&#13;
cocoa, gold, electricity, diamonds and raw timber. There is also a significant export of non-precious hard&#13;
minerals. As basically industrial products, marketability is not a priority for these products. On the non-&#13;
traditional side, however, the picture is very different. The products range from African textiles and&#13;
traditional Ghanaian weaving such as the famous kente cloth, wood products and wooden furniture made&#13;
from African hardwoods, handicrafts such as wood carving, beads, small metal works and leather goods,&#13;
small scale manufacturing and rather large-scale production and export of premium, but highly perishable,&#13;
fruits and vegetables such as pineapples, mangoes and cassava. It is in this latter range of products that the&#13;
need to introduce the concept of industrial design concepts is overwhelmingly obvious.&#13;
76.    Objectives and Description. The project will fund consultancy services for a study to more fully&#13;
establish the need, scope and nature of a design center. The study will initially investigate the design&#13;
establishment that already exists within Ghana; document opinions from a sectoral cross section of the private&#13;
sector companies in the non-traditional areas detailed above and establish their need for such a facility and&#13;
their interest in supporting such an initiative with both direct financial investment and commercial contracts;&#13;
evaluate the present group of design graduates within the Ghanaian system and prepare a skills assessment&#13;
in the light of the information and needs expressed by the private sector interviews; investigate the optimum&#13;
structure and organization for a privately-managed, commercially-run center and identifying its sponsorship&#13;
and suggested location; develop detailed budget estimates for the center including equipment estimates,&#13;
recurrent expenditures, training, consulting support, twinning arrangements with foreign design centers,&#13;
information and library systems, and other support systems. The Implementation Manual, Section IV,&#13;
provides the terms of reference for this study.&#13;
77.    Implementation. The proposed study will be coordinated under the auspices of MEST. A condition&#13;
of disbursement for equipment for the design center would be the establishment, in a manner satisfactory&#13;
to IDA, of the commercial feasibility of the design center and the adoption of organizational, implementation&#13;
and staffing plans.&#13;
(v) Legal Assistance and Diagnostic Study (US$1.4 million)&#13;
78.    Background. Through the dialogue established with the Private Sector Roundtable, one of the key&#13;
issues that emerged as a constraint to commercial development was the unresponsiveness of the legal system&#13;
to the needs of industry and commerce in support of business transactions and the settlement of contract and&#13;
other civil disputes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
79.    An area of concern identified was the need of the legal system to upgrade its delivery of services&#13;
by improving its information and administrative systems. There is generally good agreement that Ghana has&#13;
developed a body of private sector legislation that is largely appropriate and relevant but there is little&#13;
agreement on its effectiveness.&#13;
80.    Objective and Description. The objective of this project component is to improve the operations&#13;
of the court system and improve legal information and research operations. The main activities to be funded&#13;
under this component include: (i) a study and support to meet identified immediate needs of the MOJ and&#13;
the Superior Courts in Accra for (a) stocking their libraries, (b) training, and (c) office equipment; and (ii)&#13;
a more extensive review of the legal sector including an examination of: (a) the operation of the judiciary,&#13;
including court management systems, physical infrastructure and in-service training; (b) the role and&#13;
organization of the MOJ, and other government legal offices; (c) the role of the various registries and&#13;
property transfer systems (e.g., land title, mortgages, copyright, companies, etc.); (d) dissemination of legal&#13;
information through the publication and distribution of legislation, regulations and law reports (including&#13;
activities of the Council for Law Reporting and Assembly Press); (e) the Law Reform Commission; (f) the&#13;
role and organization of law libraries at the university, in the judiciary and at the various government&#13;
agencies; (g) the development of a legal information system and data base; (h) the law school and faculties;&#13;
(i) the legal profession and the Ghana Bar Association; and (j) arbitration, alternative dispute settlement&#13;
mechanisms and administrative law procedures. It is anticipated that the longer term issues identified and&#13;
recommendations stemming from these studies will be addressed in a future project. The Implementation&#13;
Manual, Section V, provides the terms of reference for these studies.&#13;
81.    Implementation. The Attorney General's Department (AGD) will be the implementing agency for&#13;
this component. For purposes of guiding the development of medium- to long-term initiatives, the AGD&#13;
would oversee the establishment of a legal sector coordinating committee (LSCC) to manage the development&#13;
of a legal sector strategy to be presented to the Government and IDA. The LSCC would include&#13;
representation from (a) the AGD (which will chair the committee), (b) the Judiciary, (c) the MFEP, (d) the&#13;
Ghana Bar Association, (e) the Lands Commission and other entities responsible for the operation of the&#13;
various official registries and land transfer procedures, (f) the Ghana Law School and the law faculties, and&#13;
(g) private sector businessmen. The LSCC would coordinate and supervise the work of the various&#13;
consultants and experts who would be examining the different aspects of the legal sector. The use of local&#13;
consultants would be emphasized. It is expected that the work of the various consultants would be completed&#13;
within twelve months.&#13;
82.    The LSCC would organize and conduct a workshop with the various operators and users within the&#13;
public and private sectors to review the findings of the studies and develop a proposed strategy for the sector&#13;
for consideration by the Government. The LSCC would also assist to coordinate donor assistance for the&#13;
legal sector.&#13;
83.    The conditions for credit effectiveness under this component include (i) the establishment of the&#13;
LSCC with membership and under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA; and (ii) prepared terms of&#13;
reference and draft letters of invitation for the study on the library requirements of the MOJ and the&#13;
judiciary, operation of the judiciary, and the production and dissemination of legal information.&#13;
Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
84.    The proposed credit of US$13 million would be allocated for the project components as follows: (a)&#13;
commercialization of the CSIR and support for GSB (US$6.4 million); (b) Technology and Enterprise&#13;
Development Fund (US$2.5 million), structured on a cost-sharing basis from the beneficiaries; (c) Ghana&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Trade Fair Authority studies (US$950,000); (d) a design center study and support to implement&#13;
recommendations (US$750,000) and; (e) legal sector diagnostic studies and assistance (US$1.4 million).&#13;
85.    Indicative total project costs, including duties and taxes, are estimated at US$15.5 million. The&#13;
Credit will finance 100 percent of foreign costs (USSI0.7 million equivalent) and 90 percent of local costs&#13;
(US$2.3 million equivalent).  Total counterpart funds are estimated at approximately US$2.5 million&#13;
equivalent, of which US$1.4 million equivalent to be provided directly by the Government and other&#13;
beneficiaries and US$1. I million equivalent anticipated under the TEDF from private sector companies. A&#13;
project account will be established with an initial deposit in cedis equivalent to US$60,000 as counterpart&#13;
funds. A PPF in the amount of US$400,000 was approved by IDA to support preparatory work under the&#13;
project.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
86.    The project has important capacity building objectives and will finance about $4.3 million of&#13;
consulting services and about $2 million for studies. The following table provides indicative figures of short-&#13;
term consulting services, including local and foreign consulting requirements, envisaged under each project&#13;
component. The terms of reference for the consulting assignments and projected training requirements of&#13;
and by consultants to ensure the necessary skills transfer are provided in the Implementation Manual.&#13;
Following discussions with beneficiary agencies and given Ghana's skills level, it was assumed throughout&#13;
project preparation that there is adequate counterpart staff available to take over from foreign experts.&#13;

Supervising Agency&#13;
87.    A Project Coordinating Team (PCT) in the MFEP will be the overall coordinating and implementing&#13;
agency for the Credit. The head of this team was nominated prior to negotiations and the PCT will be&#13;
established as a condition for project effectiveness. The PCT will ensure that all project related accounts&#13;
for all the implementing agencies are established and maintained in accordance with Intemational Accounting&#13;
Standards and that these project accounts, special account and statements of expenditure are audited at the&#13;
end of each fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The PCT will also coordinate the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
submission to IDA of all implementation reports by all participating beneficiary agencies, who will be&#13;
responsible for ensuring such reports are provided to the PCT in a timely manner.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
88.    All procurement procedures under the project will be done under World Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers.&#13;
89.   Procurement for equipment, which will principally include laboratory and scientific equipment,&#13;
would be grouped in packages of US$100,000 and above and would be procured by International&#13;
Competitive Bidding(CB). Domestic firms will be eligible for domestic preference per Bank guidelines.&#13;
Procurement under ICB will be based on Standard Bidding Documents. Procurement of civil works&#13;
estimated to cost US$200,000 or more will be procured by ICB.&#13;
90.   Contracts below the above threshold (because of lower values and specialized nature) would be&#13;
procured by (i) Limited International Bidding (LIB) for goods costing less than US$100,000 up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$400,000 (ii) international/local shopping procedures for goods costing less than US$50,000&#13;
up to an aggregate of US$500,000. As an alternative to shopping, wherever appropriate, IAPSO procedures&#13;
may be sought; (iii) direct contracting with IDA approval for proprietary equipment up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$200,000;(iv) because of their size and nature which would not be of interest to international bidders,&#13;
civil works contracts would be procured following LCB procedures up to an aggregate of US$300,000.&#13;
There will be no restriction placed on the participation of international bidders. Consulting contracts will&#13;
be provided for the CSIR and GSB in the fields of technological organization, planning and organizational&#13;
management, marketing and finance and for EMPRETEC, in the fields of technological services as well as&#13;
financial and management systems. With respect to the legal studies, consulting contracts will focus&#13;
principally on legal information and administrative systems. Training programs will be prepared on an&#13;
annual basis acceptable to IDA indicating persons, courses, places, period and estimated costs.&#13;
91.   Contracts for (i) goods and works over US$100,000; (ii) for individual consultant contracts over&#13;
US$25,000 and; (iii) contracts to consulting firms over US$50,000 will be subject to IDA's prior review.&#13;
Contracts below the above limits will be subject to IDA's post-review. Prior review will be required for&#13;
consulting contracts amounting to US$20,000 and above under the TEDF. Procurement progress will be&#13;
reported on a six monthly basis according to agreed formats.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
92.   The CSIR Secretariat will be responsible for the procurement of equipment for the CSIR institutes&#13;
and ensuring that they are consistent with the approved (by IDA and MEST) rationalization plans.&#13;
93.   To facilitate disbursements from the Credit proceeds, a Special Account in US dollars will be&#13;
established and maintained in US dollars in a commercial bank and on terms and conditions acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The Special Account will have an authorized allocation of US$0.75 million representing four months'&#13;
average project expenditure. Upon effectiveness, an authorized allocation of US$500,000 will be deposited&#13;
into the special account. The remainder will be made available as needed. Replenishment applications&#13;
should be submitted monthly and will be fully documented except for contracts of less than US$50,000 which&#13;
may be claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). All supporting documents will be&#13;
retained for review in regular supervision missions and the external auditors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Account and Audit Arrangement&#13;
94.    MIFEP will ensure that all project related accounts are established and project accounts, the special&#13;
account, and statements of expenditure of the implementing agencies will be audited at the end of each fiscal&#13;
year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Copies of the audit reports will be forwarded to IDA within&#13;
six months after the end of each reporting period.&#13;
95.    EMPRETEC's accounts and the accounts for the TEDF unit shall be examined twice a year by&#13;
independent auditors. The TEDF unit shall also be subjected to a semi-annual management and technical&#13;
audit. Following principles similar to those used for the financial audit, the experts shall verify and certify&#13;
the proper application at all levels, in both spirit and letter, of the guidelines set forth in EMPRETEC's&#13;
Manual of Procedures as well as compliance with all of its contractual obligations. Special attention shall&#13;
be paid to verification of the quality of worksite monitoring and of the resulting information. The audit&#13;
periodicity will be examined during the mid-term review process.&#13;
Monitoring and Progress Reporting&#13;
96.    The implementing agencies will maintain adequate records and project information systems that&#13;
would provide data for semi-annual progress reports to be submitted to IDA by MFEP by March and&#13;
September of each year with the first report due in March 1995. Reports should cover progress on the&#13;
implementation of the credit components: the commercialization process of CSIR, operations of the TEDF,&#13;
progress on the studies on the design center, the GTFA and legal component, and other essential information&#13;
required by the Government and IDA in their guidance of program promotion and technical assistance&#13;
activities.&#13;
97.    Semi-annual project implementation reviews will be conducted by IDA together with each agency&#13;
participating in the project. Supervision reviews, including a joint IDA-Government mid-term review, will&#13;
monitor overall project execution, key project activities, project management and implementation&#13;
arrangement, and supervision plans, respectively, update the project timetable, identify implementation issues&#13;
and develop solutions to ensuing problems. All semi-annual progress reports will serve as input for IDA&#13;
supervision missions, the mid-term project review, and the project implementation completion report to be&#13;
prepared within six months of the closing of the project. The project is expected to be completed by&#13;
December 31, 1999.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Private Sector Development Project
            will foster the development of a competitive private sector
            by: a) assisting the Government in building on its
            investment liberalization by supporting its efforts to
            restructure, reform and commercialize its technical research
            and development establishment along competitive and demand
            driven principles; b) providing to a broad segment of the
            private sector the necessary financial and technial
            assistance to support the development of commercially
            bankable projects by improving their feasiblity and quality;
            c) supporting efforts by the export industry to improve
            their design and the promotion of their products; and d)
            assisting the Government in developing a program to upgrade
            the delivery of legal services to the commercial and
            manufacturing sectors. The project includes the following
            components: 1) technical assistance and training to the
            Secretariat of Ghana's Council for Scientific and
            Industrial Research and four institutes; 2) technology and
