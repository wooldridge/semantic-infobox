1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Government of China (GOC) has requested Bank Group assistance to finance&#13;
an Animal Feed Project to strengthen the feed sector's institutional and technical&#13;
capabilities. GOC recognizes that infrastructure deficiencies in the country's animal feed&#13;
sector are directly hampering the progress and efficiency of livestock production. The&#13;
proposed project would: (a) improve China's production capacity for essential feed&#13;
additives, protein feed and feed processing equipment, (b) promote the development of&#13;
more efficient, vertically integrated feed milling and livestock production systems, and&#13;
(c) support animal feed sector development through institutional strengthening, technical&#13;
and managerial training, research and development, and quality control standards.&#13;
Encompassing an estimated 30 subprojects and activities strategically located in 15&#13;
provinces, the proposed project broadens the scope of the Bank Group's assistance to&#13;
agriculture by strengthening the enabling environment of China's animal feed subsector.&#13;
The project introduces a financial intermediary responsible for all Loan proceeds under&#13;
the project. A detailed assessment of China's animal feed sector is provided in the China&#13;
Animal Feed Sector Study Report (Gray Cover, Report No. 10922-CHA, June 23, 1993)&#13;
which formed the analytical basis of this project. Similarly, a review of the structure of&#13;
the banking sector and financial sector reform issues is included in the China Banking&#13;
Sector Reforms Report (Green Cover, Report No. 13492-CHA, June 27, 1995), which&#13;
formed the basis for the design of the intermediation program in the project. The project&#13;
was identified in April 1993, preappraised in October 1994, and appraised in March/April&#13;
1995.&#13;
B. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR&#13;
1.2   Agriculture in China provides sustenance for about 1.2 billion people; in 1994 it&#13;
accounted for 24 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product and is the main source&#13;
of income for some 200 million farm families. An important trend affecting the sector&#13;
has been the shift from a command economy to a more market-oriented economy.&#13;
Although elements of the old command system are still functioning in many state-owned&#13;
agroenterprises, enterprise reforms related to increased management autonomy and&#13;
liberalized markets have been increasing since late 1993. Further evidence of economic&#13;
reform affecting the rural sector is to be found in the output of township and village&#13;
enterprises (TVEs) and collectives established by individuals and by specialized&#13;
households (SH). Since the introduction of reforms in 1978, the value of goods produced&#13;
by this nonstate sector has reportedly increased from 2 percent to over 50 percent of 1994&#13;
industrial output value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR&#13;
1.3   The country's livestock subsector has undergone rapid growth during the past 15&#13;
years, resulting from the increasing demand for livestock products that accompanies&#13;
rising incomes and the accelerating reallocation of grain supplies for livestock, rather&#13;
than human consumption. Between 1985 and 1992, China's Gross Agricultural Output&#13;
Value (GAOV) from animal husbandry increased from 14.5 percent to 27.0 percent of&#13;
total GAOV; this represents the second largest agriculture subsector increase after&#13;
fisheries. China's livestock inventory has increased substantially during the past five&#13;
years (Annex 1. 1). Increases in livestock inventories ranged from 13.7 percent for pigs to&#13;
19.2 percent for large ruminants (beef and dairy cattle; buffalo) and 30.4 percent for small&#13;
ruminants (sheep and goats). The largest increases occurred in poultry and related egg&#13;
production, with five-year growths of 49 percent and 83 percent, respectively. By world&#13;
standards, however, these outputs remain low when assessed on a per capita basis&#13;
(Annex 1.2).&#13;
1.4   Growth of Consumer Demand.  Average 1994 per capita meat and egg&#13;
production stood at 41 kg, equivalent to only a 112 g daily intake of animal protein&#13;
(Annex 1.2). By 2010, average per capita consumption of meats and other livestock&#13;
products is projected to reach 66.2 kg, a 95 percent increase over 1993. Per capita&#13;
consumption increases projected for specific livestock products are even greater: poultry&#13;
(275 percent), eggs (200 percent), aquatic products (223 percent) and milk (233 percent).&#13;
These projected increases in animal product consumption will require concurrent&#13;
increases in manufactured feed production.&#13;
1.5   The Demand for Feed. Two major factors impact on the feed industry's ability&#13;
to meet the growing demand for manufactured feeds: (a) the balance of feed grain&#13;
requirement and supply, and (b) the feed industry's material and technical capabilities in&#13;
meeting requirements for feed and feed additives. These interrelationships are further&#13;
expanded below. Requirements for all types of feed are projected to rise from 178&#13;
million tons per annum (tpa) in 1990 to 228 million tpa by 2010. By 2010, the national&#13;
feed grain balance (total requirements by human and livestock populations less supplies)&#13;
is projected to fall short by 48 million tons. The need to develop a national feed security&#13;
strategy to deal with impending feed shortages is therefore an urgent one. Such a strategy&#13;
should deal with increased regional feed crop diversification shifting from energy to&#13;
protein crop production. China is chronically short of protein feeds, as documented by its&#13;
national crop production profile in which high-energy crop production (grains, corn,&#13;
brans, high fiber root crops) occupies 95 percent of total crop production compared to&#13;
only 5 percent for high-protein crops (oil seed crops, soybeans and pulse crops).&#13;
Additional strategic requirements include the rationalization of national feed mill capacity&#13;
utilization; increasing conversion of agroindustrial byproducts into value-added animal&#13;
feed ingredients; and improving human resource skills and technology acquisition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. THE ANIMAL FEED SUBSECTOR&#13;
1.6    General Subsector Infrastructure. China's modem feed subsector has become&#13;
the second largest in the world in terms of capacity and in 1994 produced 42.3 million&#13;
tons of manufactured feed. This output contributed only 20 percent to China's total&#13;
estimated livestock consumption of feed grains. This low level of market penetration by&#13;
manufactured feeds indicates the extent that modem feeding practices have yet to be&#13;
accepted and developed. Even though manufactured feed production is projected to&#13;
increase to 79 million and 117 million tons by 2000 and 2010, respectively, at a rate of&#13;
close to 50 percent per decade, the supply of such feeds is still projected to fall behind&#13;
demand.&#13;
1.7    The production of animal feed is a complex process comprising three phases:&#13;
(a) raw materials procurement and handling, (b) feed formulation and processing, and&#13;
(c) quality control, marketing, and support services. During the first phase, energy and&#13;
protein feed crops and crop byproducts, the basic raw materials in feed formulation, are&#13;
cultivated and procured. Protein feeds can also be produced from agroindustrial wastes&#13;
and byproducts by fermentation. A diverse group of chemical and biological feed&#13;
additives is required to supply vitamins, minerals, medicaments and other growth&#13;
promotants. The second phase involves the blending of raw materials into specialty feed&#13;
products such as protein concentrates and vitamin/mineral premixes. This process&#13;
requires specially designed and manufactured feed processing equipment and feed mills&#13;
designed to produce manufactured feeds or specialty feed products. Also required is feed&#13;
formulation technology with which to produce feeds containing adequate nutrient&#13;
content, in-plant quality control, and technical or managerial skills. During the third&#13;
phase, feeds and specialty products are marketed to livestock producers or to other feed&#13;
mills, requiring marketing strategies and planning, and farmer extension services and&#13;
training in modem feeding practices.&#13;
1.8    Role of the State Sector. The subsector's multiagency infrastructure is presented&#13;
in Chart 1.1. Mills nominally overseen by the Ministry of Intemal Trade (MIT) are&#13;
primarily those associated with grain and oilseed processing and they tend to be of&#13;
medium to large-size capacity, accounting for 49 percent of national mill capacity. The&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), responsible for supporting grain and oilseed as well as&#13;
livestock production, oversees the largest number of feed mills (comprising 35 percent of&#13;
mill capacity) but these tend to be small and operate principally at the county and&#13;
township levels, servicing small-scale livestock producers.' The remaining 16 percent of&#13;
feed mill capacity is operated by units under other ministries and private (including&#13;
foreign) owners. Of the over 1 1,000 feed mills operating in China in 1993, over 10,000&#13;
The above ministerial orientations imply technical leadership only, as the mills are actually owned by&#13;
jurisdictions at the provincial, municipal, prefectural, county, township and village levels, or by private&#13;
individuals or groups. State ownership implies ownership at the county level or above. In the feed&#13;
subsector today, even most state-owned mills are subject to market forces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
were classified as small (&lt;1 tph), 980 and over 1,100 as medium-size (1-5 tph) or large&#13;
(25 tph) (Annex L3). The government's main agency overseeing the feed industry, the&#13;
National Feed Industry Office (NFIO), is actually a small unit located in MOA with no&#13;
executive authority; it neither owns nor operates mills or other installations.&#13;
1.9   Role of the Private/Nonstate Sector. A small but growing private industry&#13;
segment, comprising mainly Sino-foreign joint venture mills operating with modem&#13;
equipment, feed formulation technology and superior mill management, produces 10&#13;
percent of national manufactured feed output while utilizing only 4 percent of national&#13;
feed mill capacity (AnnrtcU). Private feed mills have introduced three important&#13;
elements that were heretofore missing in the feed subsector: (a) improved managerial&#13;
skills, (b) more aggressive market development and customer services, and&#13;
(c) responsibility for corporate profits and losses. Joint ventures are stimulating regional&#13;
competition in local feed markets previously controlled, often on a natural monopoly&#13;
basis, by local government and TVE mills.&#13;
1.10  Feed Mill Capacity Utilization. In planning the development of the feed milling&#13;
industry in the 1970s, the government adopted a strategy of maximum involvement by&#13;
the broadest possible range of agencies and enterprises in order to maximize investment&#13;
and capacity building. This has led to the present status of multiple-agency responsibility&#13;
which, lacking lateral coordination and unified planning, frequently results in duplication&#13;
and inefficiency of resource utilization. The ambitious goal by GOC2 to reach 59 million&#13;
tons of feed production capacity by 1990 was met, but actual mill capacity utilization at&#13;
that time had reached only 52 percent.3 Average capacity utilization of feed mills located&#13;
in the project provinces varies greatly, from a high of 108 to a low of 43 percent (Annex&#13;
L4). Variations in production efficiency have several causes, the most important of&#13;
which has been the buildup of uncoordinated production capacity without due emphasis&#13;
on product quality and marketing. Contributing factors include poor technology, feed&#13;
mill management, labor skills, and equipment.&#13;
1.11   Specialty Feed Production. With the increasing intensification of livestock&#13;
production, the requirements for specialty feeds, especially protein concentrates, have&#13;
become more urgent. Of the total 42.3 million tons of manufactured feeds produced in&#13;
1994, an increase of over 28 percent since 1990, only 1.7 million and 0.64 million tons&#13;
comprised protein concentrate feeds and vitamin-mineral premixes, respectively (Annex&#13;
I 5). The production of such specialty feeds needs to be greatly increased if the&#13;
commensurate increase in fully formulated feeds is to keep pace with livestock&#13;
requirements.&#13;
2 Government goals are stated in the 1984 draft report The National Feed Industry Development&#13;
Program, 1984-2000.&#13;
3 Based on the Chinese industry norm of two 8-hour shifts for 250 working days per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Feed Additives Industry&#13;
1.12   Vitamins.  Feed additives4 are critical ingredients in formulated feeds and&#13;
contribute greatly to improved livestock performance. Of the 13 essential feed vitamins&#13;
required in livestock feeding, China is domestically self-sufficient in only three (A, B,&#13;
and B6), and produces varying but small quantities of eight others. This amounted to a&#13;
1993 self sufficiency of less than 5 percent in domestically produced feed vitamins. GOC&#13;
has called for a target of 60 percent domestic self-sufficiency in feed additives by 2000.&#13;
Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is one of the most essential B vitamins for poultry and pig&#13;
nutrition and it is in very short supply in China. Expansion of the range, quality and&#13;
quantity of domestically produced feed vitamins with which to reach this goal would&#13;
require greatly accelerated access to both foreign technology and investment. China's&#13;
expertise in vitamin manufacturing technology is moderately well developed, but output&#13;
is hampered by the absence of modem equipment and process control systems.&#13;
1.13   Feed Minerals.  China's diverse natural mineral resources include all base&#13;
materials necessary for the production of a complete range of feed minerals. However,&#13;
data available indicate that domestic supplies of macro- and microminerals could meet&#13;
only 42 percent and 13 percent of requirements, respectively. Furthermore, the blending&#13;
of microminerals requires rather sophisticated micromixing technology and equipment,&#13;
both of which are in short supply.&#13;
1.14   Lysine Production. Given the growing shortages of feed protein in China, the&#13;
inclusion into feeds of synthetic amino acids, principally lysine and methionine is not&#13;
only becoming increasingly cost effective, but also nutritionally more essential.&#13;
Projected requirements for synthetic lysine and methionine by 2010 are estimated to&#13;
reach 51,000 tpa and 29,000 tpa, respectively. Although the domestic production&#13;
capacity of synthetic lysine and methionine has reached 6,000 tpa and 20,000 tpa,&#13;
respectively, actual lysine production is only 3,000 tpa and no methionine production&#13;
occurred until 1994. Substandard production technology, raw materials supply gaps and&#13;
weak plant management are chiefly responsible for the poor performance of existing&#13;
lysine plants.&#13;
Enhanced-Protein Feed Synthesis&#13;
1.15   The bioconversion of agroindustrial byproducts into enhanced protein feed&#13;
products is becoming a burgeoning industry in China. Through the use of fermentation&#13;
technologies bioconversion has the potential of substantially contributing to reducing the&#13;
country's protein feed deficits. Bioconversion technology provides value-added to low-&#13;
quality byproducts while removing environmentally harmful effluents. Reliable data are&#13;
4 Feed additives are included in formulated feeds in relatively small quantities. They comprise essential&#13;
nutrients (amino acids, vitamins, minerals), growth promotants, flavoring agents, hormones,&#13;
medicaments, feed preservatives such as antioxidants, and other micro-ingredients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
not available to ascertain China's present output of enhanced-protein feedstuffs, but&#13;
estimates of the potential bioconversion of available agroindustrial waste and byproducts&#13;
of plant and animal origin by 2000 are in the order of 4.5 million tons of enhanced-&#13;
protein feed, an amount estimated to satisfy one-fourth of China's feed protein needs by&#13;
2000.&#13;
Feed Processing Equipment&#13;
1.16  At present, over 400 equipment manufacturing entities, often in the form of small&#13;
subdivisions or workshops of larger manufacturing plants, are engaged in the design and&#13;
production of feed milling equipment. The Ministries of Agriculture and Intemal Trade&#13;
each own agricultural equipment design institutes which undertake feed processing&#13;
equipment design work. Virtually all processing equipment produced in China is rated&#13;
up to 10 tph capacity, which is small by global standards. This is due to the low domestic&#13;
steel quality, which requires expensive and inefficient overdesigns. The projected&#13;
increases in feed consumption until 2010 will require the annual manufacture of 80 units&#13;
of 20 tph or larger feed processing lines, plus an additional 30 units to replace old ones,&#13;
for a national total of 1 10 larger-scale units per year.&#13;
1.17  The emergence during the past five years of pelleted feeds for pigs, poultry and&#13;
fish, which improve feed conversion into meat by 5 percent to 15 percent, has caused a&#13;
rapidly increasing demand for pelleting equipment. Pelleting dies and rollers, if not cast&#13;
from high-tension steel, wear out quickly. Pellet quality is adversely affected, and&#13;
frequent equipment replacement adds to the cost of feed. In 1992, 6 million tons of&#13;
pelleted feed were produced requiring an estimated 6,000 replacement dies and 37,000&#13;
rollers, assuming a working life for die and roller sets of 1,000 t of feed, or one-third the&#13;
life span of high-tension steel parts. With the projected increases in pelleted feed, an&#13;
estimated 15,000 dies and 45,000 rollers will be required annually in China by 2010. The&#13;
current national production of these two items represents only 30 percent of demand. As&#13;
imported quality-steel dies and rolls are priced three to four times higher than&#13;
domestically produced ones, improving the latter would appear to be economically&#13;
rational.&#13;
Protein Feed Crop Production&#13;
1.18  Canola (Low-toxin Rapeseed) Production. Rapeseed is China's most prevalent&#13;
oilseed crop, mainly cultivated for the extraction of vegetable oil for cooking. The&#13;
extracted cake or meal has had limited use as an animal feed, because of the presence of&#13;
two toxins. These toxins limit the inclusion rate of untreated rapeseed cake or meal to&#13;
only 5 percent in manufactured feeds. Due to its toxic nature the majority of rapeseed&#13;
cake or meal has been used as organic compost on cropland, thereby diverting a nutritious&#13;
feed ingredient from animal feeding. The recent introduction of canola (low-toxin&#13;
rapeseed) varieties has presented the opportunity to improve both oil as well as meal&#13;
quality. In 1993 canola was cultivated in 12 provinces on a combined 271,000 ha,&#13;
covering 8.2 percent of the total area under rapeseed in these provinces (Anne1..L6). The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
use of solvent-extracted canola meal in feed formulation is attractive because of its&#13;
favorable price comparison on an energy and protein equivalent-basis, with soybean&#13;
meal. Also, except in the coldest parts of the country it can be grown as a winter crop&#13;
and therefore does not compete with major cereal crops. A national shift from traditional&#13;
rapeseed to canola could add 4.7 million tons of protein feed for livestock feeding.&#13;
1.19  Soybean Production. Soybeans represent the most effective high-protein crop&#13;
with which to supply protein to livestock in many parts of China. Since 1992 crop&#13;
substitution programs have resulted in increased soybean cultivation at the expense of&#13;
sugarbeets and corn in the northeast, and of cotton in the North China Plain. As a result,&#13;
soybean production projections for 1995 show an increase of about 27 percent to 15.7&#13;
million tons.  Presently, soybean production occupies 23 percent of the national&#13;
agroindustrial cropping area. The limiting factor for soybean production is the traditional&#13;
designation of soybeans as a secondary grain crop, receiving only limited agricultural&#13;
support services and research. The potential for genetic yield improvement remains high,&#13;
however. With an average national soybean yield of 1.4 t/ha, yields can be almost&#13;
doubled utilizing improved varieties and agronomic practices. Soybean prices are also&#13;
rising, providing a strong production incentive.&#13;
Feed Commodity Marketing&#13;
1.20  The emergence in China of agricultural commodity markets represents a new&#13;
initiative in the agriculture sector's response to free market orientation. With rapidly&#13;
increasing requirements for manufactured feeds the need to better link buyers and sellers&#13;
of grain and feed additive ingredients is important. The increasing capacity of feed mills&#13;
will require more sophisticated commodity procurement mechanisms, including forward&#13;
buying, improved commodity price information systems, and more efficient bulk&#13;
channeling of commodities from  sellers to buyers.  In contrast to these needs,&#13;
communication systems and trade networks are poorly developed, with the result that&#13;
buyers do not know of altemative sources of key ingredients, or of current market&#13;
conditions in supply areas. Small purchases based on the physical movement of product&#13;
back and forth among intermediaries increases costs and adds inordinately to the burden&#13;
on transport infrastructure. Electronic trading and the establishment of a comprehensive&#13;
trading network would be fundamental to the development of an efficient marketing&#13;
system for these commodities.&#13;
Integrated Agroenterprise Operation&#13;
1.21  The evolution of China's feed mill subsector into specialized product milling&#13;
(Annex .l5) is creating opportunities for a more integrated approach to feed and livestock&#13;
production. A small but growing number of Sino-foreign joint venture enterprises is&#13;
successfully developing the integrated production concept using effective managerial and&#13;
technical agribusiness skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
1.22   Vertically integrated feed and livestock production can be seen as a pyramid with,&#13;
at its apex, specialty feed5 production, followed by lower but increasingly broader layers&#13;
of compound feed production (using specialty feeds), livestock production, livestock&#13;
processing or direct sales, and marketing. The base of the pyramid, represented by the&#13;
broadest layer, encompasses an array of technical and marketing support services and&#13;
activities, in close contact with the producers and buyers of the pyramid's outputs. Under&#13;
this system, the livestock production layer can be undertaken through household contract&#13;
production (satellite farmers), thereby providing employment opportunities to farmers.&#13;
Production inputs can be provided by the nucleus enterprise to satellite feed mills and&#13;
farmers. In this manner the technical and production input resources from nucleus&#13;
enterprises can be brought to bear on large numbers of participating satellite farmers and&#13;
smaller enterprises. Pyramid systems such as described have not been developed well in&#13;
China but can be undertaken by reorganizing large, existing agroenterprises and linking&#13;
them to area farmers.&#13;
Support Services&#13;
1.23   Skills Development.  The rapid expansion of the animal feed industry has&#13;
resulted in a severe skills gap. Only an estimated 10,000 of the reported 300,000 workers&#13;
employed in the feed industry have a high school education. The larger feed mills&#13;
employ qualified managerial and technical staffs, but the large TVE mill segment&#13;
operates with little such skills. The institutionalization of quality control, small business&#13;
management, feed formulation, marketing and client support services, is greatly&#13;
hampered in this industry segment due to the near absence of training and skills in these&#13;
areas.&#13;
1.24   Although central and provincial agricultural training programs cover animal&#13;
nutrition, very few institutions deal specifically with academic or vocational training in&#13;
applied feed production sciences. The feed industry's principal sponsoring Ministries of&#13;
Agriculture and Internal Trade have been primarily responsible for skills development in&#13;
the feed industry. At the academic level, nine university faculties have, either directly or&#13;
under their animal science faculties, undergraduate and graduate feed science or animal&#13;
nutrition programs. At the provincial agricultural college level, feed science and animal&#13;
nutrition are taught routinely where animal science programs exist, but such courses tend&#13;
to be theoretical in nature. The provincial Feed Industry Offices offer occasional&#13;
vocational training courses directed at feed mill workers, but limited budgets constrain&#13;
the frequency, duration and content of such courses. There are no specific courses in&#13;
managerial skills development related to feed milling.  Agribusiness management&#13;
training, needed as the sector moves toward more commercialized operations, is presently&#13;
not available in China.&#13;
5 Specialty feeds in this report denote feed additives and high-protein feeds. Combinations thereof are&#13;
called feed concentrates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
1.25  To promote a more organized approach to feed sector development, the government&#13;
plans to establish a China Feed Industry Center (CFIC), which would coordinate programs&#13;
related to skills development and outreach training, feed sector policy planning, feed testing&#13;
and quality control, and new technology acquisition. The Center would liaise with other&#13;
Chinese and international resource entities in developing its own feed sector program,&#13;
which would, by necessity, be heavily feed industry-oriented. The Canadian International&#13;
Development Agency (CIDA) has committed to provide $3.5 million toward to&#13;
establishment of the Center, which would be developed outside the China Animal Feed&#13;
Project.  Outside the project, training and technical assistance for the institutional&#13;
strengthening of the National Feed Industry Office (NFIO), responsible for feed sector&#13;
development, and CFIC will involve policy development (145 person-months at CFIC) and&#13;
institutional strengthening (340 person-months) at CADTIC and NFIO, with committed&#13;
financing by CIDA.&#13;
1.26  Quality Control. Feed quality control at the feed mill level varies greatly with&#13;
mill size and resources, with only the largest mills operating consistent quality assurance&#13;
programs. At the TVE mill level feed quality testing facilities are virtually nonexistent&#13;
and feed quality control is rarely enforced. Quality control of domestically manufactured&#13;
vitamin/mineral premixes and protein concentrates is highly variable. This is of special&#13;
concern where concentrated feed additives must be accurately blended to avoid potential&#13;
feed toxicity at wrong concentrations.&#13;
1.27  New Product Testing. New domestic or foreign feed or feed additive products&#13;
are government-tested for safety and efficacy before receiving a marketing license. Due&#13;
to a lack of animal testing facilities, current testing procedures rarely employ statistically&#13;
significant numbers of animals from which to obtain the necessary biological data.&#13;
Testing remains confined to the verification of chemical formulas and labeled active&#13;
ingredient concentrations. With increasing numbers of chemical and biological feed&#13;
medicaments, fermentation products and growth promotants entering China, the need for&#13;
more comprehensive biological testing using animal models is urgent.&#13;
1.28  Technology Development. Industrial or academic research and development on&#13;
new feed processing equipment or feed products tends to be widespread but rather limited&#13;
in scope, coordination or resources. Two of the main constraints in feed industry&#13;
development, limited protein feed supplies and small-capacity processing equipment, are&#13;
not comprehensively addressed. Few fermentation processes for the conversion of&#13;
agroindustrial byproducts into value added protein feeds have been developed to&#13;
commercial scale due to the lack of development funds. Processing equipment design&#13;
and development has often remained behind industry needs, utilizing outmoded designs&#13;
and poor quality metals. Mass production of such equipment or spare parts is rare, as is&#13;
electronic automation.  While the SPARK program  (supporting rural technology&#13;
development) provides funds to industrial TVEs for the development of proven&#13;
technologies, no venture funds are available for developing unproven technologies.&#13;
Technology acquisition from foreign sources through joint ventures remains the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
exception. Foreign technology acquisition through licensing represents a relatively new&#13;
transfer mechanism and it, as yet, is limited by legal and contractual constraints.&#13;
E. THE FINANCE SECTOR&#13;
1.29  Rural Finance Sector. The largest agricultural banking institutions in China are&#13;
the Agricultural Bank of China, with total assets of approximately $150 billion and loans&#13;
of $75 billion, and the Rural Credit Cooperative system, with total assets of $95 billion&#13;
and loans of $50 billion, in end-1994. The other important rural financial institution is&#13;
the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corporation (CADTIC),&#13;
which was established in 1988 as one of the newly authorized trust and investment&#13;
corporations. CADTIC operates on a national basis, with headquarters in Beijing, and is&#13;
owned by the government and several state-owned banks and financial institutions.&#13;
CADTIC is emerging as one of the most highly profitable and substantial nonbanking&#13;
financial institutions (NBFIs) in China, with assets of Y 26 billion and a registered capital&#13;
of Y 942 million in end- 1994.&#13;
1.30  Financial Sector Reform. China has embarked on gradual but significant reform&#13;
of the financial sector over the past 15 years. The main thrust has been the dismantling of&#13;
the monobanking system and the development of a diversified, competitive sector. Key&#13;
steps include: the restructuring of the People's Bank of China (PBC) as a separate central&#13;
bank, the transfer of sectoral investment lending to four specialized banks, and&#13;
development of new NBFIs and capital markets. The Government has also given great&#13;
emphasis to financial deepening, as demonstrated by the development of new financial&#13;
instruments such as government bonds, commercial paper, and enterprise bonds and&#13;
shares. Finally, PBC has begun to develop some indirect tools for monetary control, with&#13;
interest rates playing a larger role in mobilizing savings and, to a lesser extent, in&#13;
allocating resources.&#13;
1.31  The pace of financial sector reform has quickened during the past two years, as&#13;
Government has recognized the critical role of financial liberalization in continued&#13;
development of the real sector. The 14th Party Central Committee in November 1993&#13;
established a new framnework for reform based on: restructuring of PBC to strengthen&#13;
centralized monetary policy management, separation of directed credit from commercial&#13;
banking through creation of new policy banks, transformation of specialized banks into&#13;
commercial banks, separation of banking and securities activities, expansion of NBFIs&#13;
and capital markets, and gradual interest rate liberalization. The Government appears to&#13;
be committed to implementing this new reform program and has taken several important&#13;
steps in 1995 and early 1996, including an increase in the level of lending and PBC&#13;
relending rates, elimination of preferential rates for 13 sectors, reduction in the scope of&#13;
the credit plan, opening of a new national money market and liberalization of money&#13;
market rates, establishment of new urban credit cooperatives, and promulgation of a new&#13;
Commercial Banking Law and a new Central Bank Law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
1.32  Despite this progress, weaknesses in the institutional and policy framework&#13;
continue to undermine efficient intermediation. In the banking area, the most pressing&#13;
requirements include: institutional strengthening of PBC in the areas of supervision and&#13;
payments system; rationalization of the interest rate structure and movement towards&#13;
market determined interest rates; phasing out of directed credit and credit plans;&#13;
institutional strengthening of the specialized banks and cleaning up of their portfolios,&#13;
through increased levels of provisioning and rationalization of relationships with loss-&#13;
making SOEs; development of sustainable and efficient funding mechanisms for policy&#13;
banks in an increasingly liberalized policy environment; and continued legal and&#13;
regulatory reform related to competition and banking services.&#13;
1.33 The Bank is engaged in an active policy dialogue with government on these&#13;
outstanding reform requirements. The key vehicles for these discussions have been&#13;
formal economic reports on the banking sector, the capital markets, and public finances,&#13;
informal reports on interest rate liberalization, the ongoing supervision of the FY93&#13;
Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project, and the preparation of the proposed FY97&#13;
China Construction Bank Transformation Project and the Agricultural Bank of China&#13;
Commercialization Project. In particular, the discussion has focused on three medium-&#13;
term priorities: strengthening of PBC supervision, rationalization of interest rates, and&#13;
reduction in the scope of the credit plan.&#13;
1.34  Interest Rates. PBC sets the interest rate structure for deposits and lending in&#13;
local currency that is binding on all banks and NBFIs; however, for foreign exchange&#13;
transactions, it merely publishes nonbinding "reference" rates. PBC has followed a&#13;
moderately active interest rate management policy over the past decade, with at least&#13;
fifteen adjustments since 1985. Interest rates have become negative in real terms during&#13;
periods of macroeconomic instability and high inflation, notably in 1985, 1988-89, and&#13;
1993-95. The last adjustment was in January 1995, which yielded the following interest&#13;
rate structure for loans: 9-11 percent for working capital loans, 11-14 percent for&#13;
agricultural development loans, and 12-15 percent for capital construction loans. Since&#13;
the annual domestic inflation rate is projected at 15 percent for 1995, these onlending&#13;
rates are clearly negative in real terms.&#13;
1.35  The Bank has continued to review with government the impact of administered&#13;
interest rates on savings mobilization and resource allocation, and has stressed the&#13;
importance of moving towards market-based determination of interest rates. However, in&#13;
line with the OPD Handbook on Financial Sector Operations and Operational Directive&#13;
8.30 on Financial Sector Operations, the Bank has been cautious about the timing and&#13;
sequencing of interest rate liberalization. Many of the critical policy and institutional&#13;
conditions for successful liberalization are now lacking in China: stable macroeconomic&#13;
environment, sound and comprehensive supervision by the central bank, commercialized&#13;
SOEs with regularized lending arrangements with banks, an accurate assessment of&#13;
nonperforming assets in bank portfolios, etc. Therefore, the Bank has recommended a&#13;
phased approach, with the initial steps in the short term covering: simplification of the&#13;
interest rate structure, more frequent adjustments to interest rates in line with changing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
macroeconomic conditions, elimination of restrictions on owning and operating&#13;
enterprise accounts, and elimination of administrative guidelines related to loan loss&#13;
provisioning.  Once these reforms are in place, and over the medium  term, the&#13;
Government would complete the transition to fully market-determined interest rates.&#13;
F. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.36  Rationale. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was approved by the&#13;
Board in June 1995 and reaffirmed in March 1996, emphasizes four major areas of&#13;
support: macroeconomic and structural reforms, removal of infrastructure bottlenecks,&#13;
alleviation of poverty, and environmental protection. In the first and most important area,&#13;
the CAS highlights the reform of SOEs and liberalization of the finance sector as the core&#13;
steps in both the Government's policy agenda and the Bank's assistance strategy. The&#13;
proposed project is a key element in this priority area, as follows. First, the line of credit&#13;
under the project would support the restructuring and improved operating efficiency of&#13;
SOEs through technology transfer, ownership and governance reform, and improved&#13;
operating procedures.  As reviewed in paras. 2.5-2.7, the project includes detailed&#13;
measures to promote ownership diversification, managerial autonomy, and modernization&#13;
of financial and accounting practices. Second, the institutional development program for&#13;
CADTIC would strengthen an important and growing NBFI. This will promote&#13;
improved competition in the finance sector and more efficient intermediation in rural&#13;
areas, which are key objectives of our financial sector reform program.&#13;
1.37  The project will also make an important contribution to the second priority area,&#13;
alleviation of infrastructure bottlenecks. As reviewed earlier, the development of the&#13;
livestock sector in China is constrained by a shortage of high-quality animal feeds,&#13;
reflecting supply constraints of critical feed ingredients, outdated and inefficient&#13;
production technologies, and inadequate sector planning.  The project includes a&#13;
comprehensive investment and technical assistance program designed to alleviate these&#13;
constraints and increase the sustainability and efficiency of livestock feed production.&#13;
Key measures include the development of wholesale feed commodity markets, integrated&#13;
feed and livestock production, feed additives manufacture, enhanced-protein feed product&#13;
synthesis, and feed processing equipment design and manufacture.&#13;
1.38  Lessons Learned. Bank Group lending to China's agriculture sector has often&#13;
supported the increase, intensification and diversification of feed and livestock&#13;
production. Past and current lending programs have focused on crop and livestock&#13;
support services (14 current investment projects), livestock and/or aquaculture production&#13;
(12 projects), and animal feed production (parts of 8 projects). Several of these projects,&#13;
notably Jiangxi Agricultural Development (Cr. 2097-CHA), Guangdong Agricultural&#13;
Development (Cr. 2307-CHA), Coastal Lands Development (Ln. 2924-CHA/Cr. 1887-&#13;
CHA), and Henan Agricultural Development (Cr. 2242-CHA) have recognized the&#13;
importance of establishing specialty rather than compound feed mills; the need for&#13;
rationalizing feed mill capacity utilization; and the need for more integrated production,&#13;
to take advantage of economies of scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
1.39  The 1990 preparation report for the Polish Feed Project (FAO/CP Report 65-90-&#13;
CP-POLS) refers to the need for large project areas of nontoxic strains of rapeseed&#13;
(canola) so that cross-pollination with traditional high-toxin strains will be prevented. In&#13;
China, failure to take this approach has severely retarded the introduction of nontoxic&#13;
canola meal as an acceptable livestock protein feed. Under the project, a prefecture-wide&#13;
conversion from traditional to canola rapeseed is planned (Annex 2.11, para. 5.6), thereby&#13;
introducing large pure cropping areas for pilot production and processing.&#13;
1.40  Other lessons learned from the above-noted Bank Group projects, to be addressed&#13;
and refined in the project, include: (a) development of specialty feed and feed additives&#13;
production capacity, (b) rationalization of expanding feed mill capacity utilization by&#13;
emphasizing the upgrading of existing mills over the construction of new mills,&#13;
(c) improved feed mill management, quality control and feed formulation to ensure&#13;
product marketability and client confidence, (d) improved production agribusiness&#13;
efficiency though better integration of feed and livestock production, (e) emphasis on&#13;
developing better marketing plans and strategies to optimize the sale of project outputs,&#13;
and (f) greater management autonomy, through enterprise transformation, for&#13;
participating enterprises to better respond to market forces.&#13;
1.41  In addition, the implementation experience of the Bank's four rural credit projects&#13;
in China, the 1993 OED Review of Bank Lending for Agricultural Credit and Rural&#13;
Finance, and the 1995 China Banking Sector Reforms Report have identified many&#13;
relevant lessons for the design of the intermediation program, as follows. First, Bank&#13;
intermediation projects should support the development of rural NBFIs and the&#13;
diversification of specialized agricultural banking institutions, to enhance competition&#13;
and deepen rural intermediation.  Second, financial sector projects should include&#13;
sufficient technical assistance to strengthen the institutional capacity for efficient, market-&#13;
oriented intermediation, particularly in the areas of credit appraisal and risk management.&#13;
Third, onlending decisions should be left to the banks themselves, on the basis of sound&#13;
business principles of ability and risk, with minimum intervention by the government or&#13;
the World Bank. The project would address these lessons by: (a) including institutional&#13;
support to CADTIC in the strengthening of corporate services and long-term loan&#13;
management; (b) increasing the competitiveness of CADTIC through improved corporate&#13;
planning and strategy development; and (c) ensuring that CADTIC's onlending interest&#13;
rate margin is based on sound business principles, and includes adjustments for prevailing&#13;
inflation.&#13;
&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. ANIMAL FEED SUBSECTOR DEVELOPMENT&#13;
2.1   Subsector Development Objectives. GOC has prepared a feed industry plan6&#13;
that addresses feed subsector infrastructure development. The plan's general objectives&#13;
include: (a) improving and expanding support services related to skills development,&#13;
national feed security, feed mill capacity rationalization, strategy planning, technology&#13;
acquisition and quality control, (b) increasing the production of specialty feed, feed&#13;
additives and processing equipment, and (c) increasing protein feed supply. Based on&#13;
GOC's feed subsector development plan and the Bank's Animal Feed Sector Studv, a&#13;
subsector strategy was developed by GOC and the Bank to the year 2010. In the Study,&#13;
GOC and the Bank supported measures to strengthen the feed industry by building&#13;
domestic capacity for producing essential feed commodities and other inputs, and by&#13;
strengthening feed sector institutions.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.2   The project's overall objectives are fourfold:  (a) the alleviation of supply&#13;
constraints of critical feed ingredients, (b) improving and expanding the utilization of&#13;
agroindustrial byproducts for use as high-quality livestock feeds, (c) improving the&#13;
organizational efficiency of the feed sector through specialization and integration, and&#13;
(d) the restructuring of project enterprises to effect greater corporate efficiency and&#13;
commercialization. The implementation of a strategic plan for the animal feed subsector&#13;
was combined with the goals of implementation by autonomous enterprises with varied&#13;
types of ownership across China, and onlending by an autonomous financial&#13;
intermediary. A list of strategic investments was circulated throughout the country&#13;
indicating project support for such investments, and requesting proposals from interested&#13;
and competent enterprises and organizations. From the long list of proposals received&#13;
and analyzed, an initial tranche to be supported by the project was prepared, conditional&#13;
on final acceptance by the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment&#13;
Corporation (CADTIC), the project's financial intermediary (para. 2.17).&#13;
C. PROJECT DESIGN AND RATIONALE&#13;
2.3   Project Design. The proposed project is essentially a financial intermediation&#13;
operation directed toward increasing supply constraints and strengthening the feed&#13;
subsector infrastructure, and comprises six types of domestic feed ingredient or service&#13;
6 National Feed Industry Program, 1984-2000, Ministry of Agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
capacity building subprojects or components and one feed subsector strengthening&#13;
component. This design is in line with recommendations contained in the Animal Feed&#13;
Sector Study. The six capacity building components include: (a) integrated feed and&#13;
livestock production, (b) feed additives manufacture, (c) feed protein crop production,&#13;
(d) feed processing equipment design and manufacture, (e) enhanced-protein feed product&#13;
synthesis, and (f) feed commodity wholesale marketing (Annax2.1).&#13;
2.4   Project Rationale. The project's principal rationale is to support and facilitate&#13;
the modernization and capacity expansion of China's animal feed industry. This will&#13;
allow the industry to keep better pace with the country's rapidly developing livestock&#13;
industry for which the supply of quality feeds is becoming a severe constraint. The&#13;
project will support China's feed industry with:  (a) much-needed expansion of&#13;
professional training capabilities, as well as capacity for research and development and&#13;
industrial extension, (b) prioritized and focused support in essential production capacity&#13;
building, (c) a rationalized approach to enterprise reform and commercial financial&#13;
intermediation, and (d) foreign and local technology acquisition through joint ventures&#13;
and technology licensing agreements.&#13;
D. ENTERPRISE REFORM TOWARD COMMERCIALIZATION&#13;
2.5   Ongoing Enterprise Reforms.  The ability of project loan recipients to&#13;
effectively operate in China's rapidly evolving free-market environment is of&#13;
fundamental importance to the success of the project.  To achieve this objective,&#13;
prospective loan recipients will prepare and implement comprehensive organizational and&#13;
corporate transformation action plans, linked to an implementation timetable.&#13;
2.6   Enterprise Transformation Criteria. Each participating enterprise will prepare,&#13;
as a condition to subloan approval, an enterprise transformation workplan outlining a&#13;
time-based approach to the establishment of a corporate structure with autonomous&#13;
management, modernized accounting systems, and business operations responsive to free&#13;
market principles. Transformation should cover the following criteria: (a) restructuring&#13;
into an enterprise with autonomous management, which includes a Board of Directors,&#13;
(b) modernization of accounting systems and practices, and (c) eventual divestment of&#13;
social obligations. The transformation should be completed by no later than the fourth&#13;
year of project life [Annex 3. 1, para. 3(c)].&#13;
2.7   Subproject Enterprise Characteristics. Of the 30 subprojects presently under&#13;
review, five are joint-stock companies, two are central government-owned, 19 are owned&#13;
by provincial, prefectural or county governments, and four are TVEs.  Eleven&#13;
subsponsors presently have shareholding arrangements. Three enterprises are in the&#13;
process of signing Sino-foreign joint venture or licensing agreements, and 13 will sign&#13;
domestic technology transfer agreements (Ann&amp;2.2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
E. PROPOSED SUBPROJECT PIPELINE FEATURES&#13;
2.8   The proposed 30-subproject pipeline, as described in Annex 2.1 l, represents the&#13;
proposed pipeline status at appraisal. Subprojects failing to meet established criteria with&#13;
respect to credit worthiness or viability would be replaced by CADTIC by new, similar&#13;
proposals which would meet project objectives. Assurances were obtained during&#13;
negotiations that, under this project, CADTIC will not make subloans to any enterprise in&#13;
which it owns a majority or controlling interest. The project components are described&#13;
briefly below.&#13;
Integrated Feed and Livestock Production Component&#13;
2.9   This component will promote the establishment of integrated enterprises creating,&#13;
through economy of scale from feed sales to large numbers of participating contract&#13;
farmers, increased feed utilization efficiency. Contract farmers will engage in intensive,&#13;
efficient livestock production with the benefit of enterprise-driven support services,&#13;
marketing and processing. Participating agroenterprises, with existing markets and basic&#13;
managerial and marketing skills, will be reorganized into vertically integrated production&#13;
enterprises. These will produce specialty feeds and premixes, sold to participating&#13;
farmers who will produce, under contract, livestock, poultry and fish. The agroenterprise&#13;
will provide technical support services and production inputs to its contract farmers, and&#13;
will be responsible for the processing and marketing of livestock products. Several&#13;
enterprises will establish research and demonstration farms to develop and test new feed&#13;
products, and to train contract farmers.&#13;
Feed Additives Manufacture Component&#13;
2.10 This component would support the expansion and upgrading of the domestic&#13;
production capacity for selected essential nutritional feed additives such as feed-grade&#13;
vitamins, synthetic amino acids, and feed minerals. These additives have been identified&#13;
by the Livestock Sector Study as being in critical short supply, and they can be produced&#13;
from domestically available ingredients. Advanced technologies will be employed in the&#13;
manufacture of vitamin and synthetic amino acids.&#13;
Feed Processing Equipment Component&#13;
2.11  This component will finance the expansion of production capacity for urgently&#13;
needed larger-capacity (&gt;10 tph) feed formulation and mixing production equipment, as&#13;
well as high-quality tempered-steel pelleting dies and rollers to supply the rapidly&#13;
expanding feed pelleting industry. Technologies to be introduced will include state-of-&#13;
the-art steel tempering and robotic welding.&#13;
Enhanced-Protein Feed Product Synthesis Component&#13;
2.12 This component addresses: (a) the development and financing of innovative toxin&#13;
extraction technologies to improve the utilization of oilseed meals of traditional varieties,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
and (b) the application of several bioconversion technologies to agroindustrial byproducts&#13;
for the production of enhanced-protein feed products. Two innovative detoxification&#13;
technologies would be incorporated to eliminate harmful toxins from cottonseed and&#13;
rapeseed meals prior to feeding to livestock. In a series of separate pilot subprojects, an&#13;
array of microbiological fermentation processes would be applied to convert grain milling&#13;
and agroindustrial waste or byproducts into high-protein, single-cell protein feeds. The&#13;
technologies to be employed were selected on the basis of their innovation, technical and&#13;
mass production scale-up feasibility, cost competitiveness and marketability, nutritional&#13;
efficacy, and human and animal safety. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that for&#13;
subprojects requiring such technology, CADTIC would make subloans only after the&#13;
enterprises enter satisfactory technology agreements with the respective suppliers of&#13;
equipment and technology.&#13;
Integrated Protein Feed Crop Production Component&#13;
2.13  This component comprises two  pilot initiatives designed  to  establish&#13;
demonstration areas for improved soybean and toxin-free rapeseed (canola) production.&#13;
The sponsoring enterprises will provide the necessary production inputs, including&#13;
improved seed, fertilizer, support services, crop storage, processing and marketing.&#13;
Participating farmers will be engaged in contract production. The pilot areas will serve as&#13;
models for scaled up, commercialized, more cost-efficient agronomic and agroprocessing&#13;
practices. In each area, a number of government agencies have combined to form&#13;
registered enterprises to engage in the integrated production, storage, value-added&#13;
processing and marketing of their commodity.  Details on soybean and rapeseed&#13;
production are presented in Annexes 2.1 and 2.2.&#13;
Feed Commodity Wholesale Marketing Component&#13;
2.14 Two commodity markets will be established in Beijing and Guangzhou to&#13;
facilitate trading between buyers and sellers of feed ingredients. including feed additives.&#13;
Both markets will emphasize electronic over physical trading, even though warehousing&#13;
will be constructed for the storage of specialty commodities such as feed additives. The&#13;
project will finance the construction of essential trading floors, trading offices, and&#13;
computer networks to facilitate electronic trading. Both markets will handle feed grains,&#13;
byproducts and additives, although individual products and market shares will vary with&#13;
local conditions.&#13;
2.15  The feed commodity wholesale market sponsors plan to operate under the&#13;
following trade principles: (a) a policy of commodity price and accounting transparency,&#13;
(b) nondiscriminatory participation by all eligible traders, (c) an emphasis on electronic&#13;
over physical marketing, (d) a principal derivation of income from trading commissions&#13;
on behalf of third parties, and (d) no own-account trading by companies operating the&#13;
markets. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that CADTIC would approve subloans&#13;
to finance commodity markets only after guidelines acceptable to the Bank for the&#13;
operation of such markets, consistent with market principles, have been established These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
principles are stated above and were confirmed at negotiations; NFIO will supervise the&#13;
sponsors' compliance with these principles.&#13;
Subsector Strengthening Component&#13;
2.16  The China Feed Industry Center (CFIC). CFIC would coordinate feed sector&#13;
development through industrial training, research and development, feed testing, quality&#13;
control, technology acquisition, and the development of feed industry policy. The Center&#13;
would be established as a shareholding company. It would generate sufficient revenues to&#13;
cover its expenses and would be responsible for its profits and losses. Its Board of&#13;
Directors would have representation from the feed industry and agribusiness. CFIC would&#13;
be established on the campus of the China Agricultural University (CAU) in Beijing, and&#13;
would receive funding from CAU, MOA and donations from feed industry corporations. In&#13;
addition, under the project, CFIC would receive a subloan from CADTIC to establish a feed&#13;
mill, to be operated for experimental and commercial purposes. The Center would derive&#13;
its income from its feed mill operations, fees from feed testing, and consulting services. As&#13;
a condition for receiving a subloan for the feed mill, CFIC would be required to develop a&#13;
program  to strengthen its institutional capabilities.  This program  will include the&#13;
establishment of an animal feed testing unit, laboratory and specified animal production&#13;
equipment, feed industry trainer training, training program development, vocational&#13;
training, and feed industry outreach programs.&#13;
F THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY&#13;
2.17 China Agribusiness Development, Trust and Investment Corporation.&#13;
CADTIC has recently been placed under the Minister of Agriculture, to whom its&#13;
President directly reports. As a major financial institution, however, it remains under the&#13;
supervision and regulation of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank.&#13;
CADTIC is a commercially-oriented institution which finances only productive&#13;
enterprises. While it has no policy-based operations, and it actively supports all forms of&#13;
enterprise, its mandate does include an emphasis on township and village enterprises,&#13;
rural cooperatives and industrial estates in small and medium-sized towns. Based on its&#13;
financial strength, expertise in agriculture and agribusiness, and consistently&#13;
demonstrated commitment to rural reform, private sector development, and openness to&#13;
financial sector innovation, CADTIC was selected as the implementing agency for an&#13;
Asian Development Bank loan of $50 million in 1994 for TVE commercialization, and&#13;
discussions are underway for another ADB loan to be implemented by CADTIC&#13;
beginning in 1997. Bank appraisal in April 1995 confirmed the basic strength and&#13;
capacity of CADTIC to undertake the proposed role under the Animal Feed Project.&#13;
However, several areas were noted within the organization and management systems of&#13;
the Corporation that require attention if it is to continue to perform successfully as its&#13;
scope and size continue to increase. Accordingly, assurances were obtained during&#13;
negotiations that CADTIC would (a) conduct a review of its lending operations with the&#13;
purpose of improving supervision and control by consolidating its credit operations into&#13;
one department, and (b) provide a recapitalization plan to the Bank by not later than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
January 1, 1997 to ensure that CADTIC achieves a risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of&#13;
at least 8 percent by December 31, 1998 and maintain this ratio thereafter. The current&#13;
organization of CADTIC is presented in Chart 3.1.&#13;
G. APPRAISAL OF CADTIC7&#13;
2.18  Introduction. CADTIC was established in 1988 as one of the newly authorized&#13;
trust and investment corporations. It is categorized as a nonbank financial intermediary.&#13;
CADTIC operates on a national basis with headquarters in Beijing and 19 offices located&#13;
throughout the country. According to its charter, CADTIC is primarily a financial&#13;
intermediary (FI) for township and village enterprises (TVEs) to secure rural economic&#13;
development. It also serves all other types of enterprise, however, from state-owned&#13;
enterprises to cooperatives and specialized households. CADTIC is wholly owned by the&#13;
Government of China (GOC) and several state-owned entities (SOEs), which are mostly&#13;
state banks and other state-owned financial institutions. Initially CADTIC came under the&#13;
administrative supervision of the State Planning Commission (SPC); in early 1994 it was&#13;
transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). As an FI, however, it remains under the&#13;
supervision, regulation and auditing of the People's Bank of China (PBC), China's central&#13;
bank. Information related to CADTIC's consolidated balance sheets and loan collection&#13;
performance is presented in Annex 2.12.&#13;
2.19 Related Banking Experience. In 1988, CADTIC became the implementing&#13;
agency for the $300 million World Bank long-term loan to the government under its&#13;
Rural Sector Adjustment Credit. In March 1994 CADTIC successfully concluded&#13;
negotiations for a direct three-year $22.85 million loan from a syndicate of seven external&#13;
commercial banks led by Credit Suisse. Also in March 1994, CADTIC concluded&#13;
negotiations with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to implement a 15-year $50&#13;
million loan to GOC to finance intermediate and long-term loans to TVEs. Preparations&#13;
are under way for another ADB loan in 1997.&#13;
2.20  Successful Financial Institution. CADTIC is a relatively new institution that is&#13;
still developing as it attempts to respond to a rapidly changing economic and regulatory&#13;
environment. Given such an environment, CADTIC appears to be emerging as one of the&#13;
most successful financial institutions currently operating on a commercially oriented&#13;
basis in China. While CADTIC remains a GOC-owned entity, it operates with virtual&#13;
autonomy subject only to the normal supervision and regulation of PBC.&#13;
2.21  The institution has grown very rapidly during the three years ending December&#13;
31, 1994. During that period:&#13;
7 This section is a summary of the appraisal document by the same title, which is retained in the Project&#13;
Files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
(a)    Total assets employed incrLascd from Y 3.9 billion to Y  6 .3 billion or&#13;
580.6 percent;&#13;
(b)   The total loan portfolio increased from Y 975.0 million to Y 7.2 billion or&#13;
734.5 percent;&#13;
(c)   The long-terrn loans and investments portion of the loan portfolio increased&#13;
from Y 386.8 million to Y 3.7 billion or 947.4 percent, and at the end of&#13;
1994 represented 51.2 percent of the total portfolio; and&#13;
(d)   Headquarters staff more than doubled to 245 at the end of 1994.&#13;
2.22  Corporate Structure. The organizational structure of CADTIC has evolved over&#13;
its brief seven-year history in response to its growth as well as from recommendations&#13;
made by ADB during its loan negotiations in 1994. CADTIC's current functional&#13;
structure consists of six corporate departments and eight line departments, each of which&#13;
is supervised by one of the four vice presidents or the assistant to the president. General&#13;
supervision of the 19 branches falls under the president and day-to-day operations are&#13;
supervised by the respective corporate and line departments in headquarters.&#13;
2.23  International Finance Department (IFD). This department is responsible for&#13;
managing all of CADTIC's onlending programs sourced from international development&#13;
banks. To date, this consists of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The&#13;
department deals directly with lenders and borrowers and manages its own portfolio. IFD&#13;
is supervised by a vice president, a director and two assistants and has a staff of 13.&#13;
2.24  Project Management Division. This is the most important division of IFD since&#13;
it handles all of the onlending operations including loan appraisal, post-approval&#13;
borrower supervision, loan servicing, and loan collection as well as the accounting related&#13;
to those loans. Currently the division, headed by an assistant director, has a staff of seven&#13;
professionals, which is expected to be increased by five positions when the Animal Feed&#13;
Project begins.&#13;
2.25  Operating Procedures. A careful review of the division's operating procedures&#13;
and documentation practices revealed that loan appraisal procedures were thorough,&#13;
following conventional and commercially oriented evaluation techniques and were well&#13;
documented. CADTIC follows fundamentally sound and commercially oriented lending&#13;
policies, which are documented in manual form. The responsibility for all loan appraisal,&#13;
approval, supervision, loan servicing and loan collection rests in this department at the&#13;
corporate level. Staff in the branches collaborate with staff in the division, and assist in&#13;
the collection and verification of loan appraisal data, and participate in field supervision.&#13;
2.26  In 1994 CADTIC experienced a decline in loan collection performance from 93.4&#13;
percent to 84.8 percent (Annex 2.12). This is not unusual following a period of rapid&#13;
portfolio expansion, but it was seen as a danger signal to CADTIC management that has&#13;
triggered a careful review of risk management procedures within the corporation. To&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
date, CADTIC has not had a quality control or risk management function that could keep&#13;
staff performance and portfolio quality under constant review. While appraisal of&#13;
CADTIC loans has followed widely accepted procedures and standards, loan servicing&#13;
and collection are relatively new functions in China, and CADTIC's staff appear to lack&#13;
adequate training and experience in related techniques to prevent loans from becoming&#13;
problems or to rehabilitate problem loans. These will become important areas of staff&#13;
and organizational development during the life span of the proposed project.&#13;
2.27  CADTIC has several strong underlying attributes. It appears to be conservatively&#13;
but well managed and efficiently operated. Its staff is strongly motivated and seem&#13;
willing to accept and implement new procedures and practices. The corporation clearly&#13;
follows a commercially oriented philosophy that is documented in a series of policies and&#13;
procedures manuals, which were formalized in October 1994. It has adopted many&#13;
modem concepts for human resources development, although these have not yet reached&#13;
branch operations. Staffing appears to be adequate at all levels, with relatively low&#13;
tumover, and responds well to CADTIC's growing needs. It has a branch network that is&#13;
growing to meet the needs of its growing clientele. Communications linkages with its&#13;
branches and clientele are extremely good in comparison to those of many other&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
2.28  Strengthen Financial Integrity. Under the project, CADTIC will take a number&#13;
of steps to ensure its financial integrity as it continues to grow.&#13;
(a)   Increase Equity Capital. Altemative strategies will be developed to&#13;
increase and maintain CADTIC'S equity capital to at least satisfy PBC's&#13;
requirements. Among others, this might include encouraging GOC to allow&#13;
CADTIC to increase the govemment's paid-in capital by crediting it with&#13;
sums that would normally be paid in income taxes for some number of years&#13;
(for example, five years) or for GOC to allow CADTIC to sell shares to the&#13;
public up to a maximum of 49 percent of the of the paid-in capital.&#13;
(b)   Risk Management. As CADTIC'S operations continue to expand rapidly,&#13;
serious consideration should be given to establishing an Risk Management&#13;
Committee at the corporate level.&#13;
(c)   External Audit.  CADTIC's external auditors will be encouraged to&#13;
exercise a broad mandate in terms of evaluating procedures, management&#13;
and staff adequacy as part of their regular audit functions.&#13;
2.29 Strengthen Lending Operations. As CADTIC embarks on a major expansion of&#13;
its long-term lending and continues its concentration of risk in agribusiness,&#13;
strengthening its lending operations will become critical. Risk management is an area of&#13;
specific concern, one in which CADTIC's staff have had very little experience and&#13;
training. Therefore, the following actions will be taken under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(a)    Recapitalization.  CADTIC will develop a plan to ensure adequate&#13;
recapitalization, including mechanisms for equity replenishment and a&#13;
timetable for implementation. CADTIC will provide these measures to the&#13;
Bank by not later than January 1, 1997, after which CADTIC will make&#13;
modifications to the final plan to ensure that CADTIC's risk-weighted&#13;
capital adequacy ratio shall be at least 8 percent by December 31, 1998. For&#13;
purposes of this requirement, "risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio" has the&#13;
same meaning as set forth in the Basel Convention.8&#13;
(b)   Reorganize Lending Operations.   As currently structured, lending&#13;
operations are distributed among three departments. These include the&#13;
Intemational Finance Department, the Banking Department and the&#13;
International Operations Department. This segmentation makes effective&#13;
supervision and control of lending operations and especially risk&#13;
management, very difficult. All three departments follow the same basic&#13;
policies and procedures of CADTIC. Although originally intended to deal&#13;
with different markets, they now frequently deal with the same clients. All&#13;
lending operations will be consolidated into a single credit department,&#13;
which will be replicated in the branches.&#13;
(c)    Strengthen Risk Management. In order to strengthen CADTIC's risk&#13;
management, a credit review function would be established at the corporate&#13;
level. Its primary responsibilities would be to conduct credit reviews of all&#13;
of CADTIC's loans on a structured sampling basis. Loans or groups of&#13;
loans would be categorized according to their collectibility and degree of&#13;
risk and recommendations would be made as to which loans would be&#13;
placed in a nonperforming status, those for which special loss reserves&#13;
should be set up and those loans that should be charged off. Secondly, this&#13;
review would permit the evaluation of individual credit officers and the&#13;
development of recommendations on policy and procedural changes.&#13;
(d)   Improve  Management Information  System.   Another important&#13;
component of effective risk management is an adequate management&#13;
information system (MIS). The MIS must provide senior management with&#13;
a routine flow of critical data to permit it to identify existing and developing&#13;
problems in all aspects of loan administration, to pinpoint where and what&#13;
types of corrective actions need to be taken, and the levels of effort to be&#13;
applied. Although a complete review of CADTIC's MIS was not made, it&#13;
was apparent that the flow of data to effectively manage loan risk was&#13;
inadequate at both the corporate and branch levels. Since the vast majority&#13;
of CADTIC's loan and accounting records are computerized, it will engage&#13;
"Basel Convention" means the Agreement for establishing minimum capital levels in banking&#13;
established by the Bank Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervision Practices, issued in 1988.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
an MIS specialist to design an effective system that would go beyond loan&#13;
risk management to other critical needs of the corporation.&#13;
(e)   Provide Additional Training  in Lending Operations and  Risk&#13;
Management. Additional training will be provided to credit staff in both&#13;
headquarters and the branches.  Such training should be focused on&#13;
techniques to effectively manage long-term loans, which is a relatively new&#13;
phenomenon in China. Ideally, this should be on-the-job training but some&#13;
training in more developed countries in the use of financial intermediaries,&#13;
with an emphasis in agribusiness lending, could also be very beneficial.&#13;
2.30  Virtually all of the foregoing recommendations involve procedures, practices and&#13;
basic banking disciplines for which little to no professional expertise exists in China.&#13;
Training and technical assistance will be provided to assist in and provide supervision in&#13;
implementing the recommended needs and to help assure the effective implementation of&#13;
the proposed Animal Feed Project. A complete institutional development and training&#13;
schedule for CADTIC is presented in Annex 2.8 and Annex 2.9, Table 2. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that CADTIC would undertake a program of institutional&#13;
strengthening along the lines outlined above, and that to assist it in developing and&#13;
implementing this program it would employ consultants with terms of reference,&#13;
qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank Funds to implement the training and&#13;
technical assistance for this program will be made available through parallel cofinancing&#13;
from CIDA.&#13;
H. STATUS OF PREPARATION&#13;
2.31  At the completion of the appraisal mission in April 1995 comprehensive proposals&#13;
for the 30-subproject pipeline and for the PMO project management budget had been&#13;
completely reviewed and analyzed by the Bank mission. CADTIC has itself reviewed the&#13;
existing pipeline and has divided it into three groups of subprojects, based on their stage&#13;
of preparedness for subloan approval. Most of the additional inputs that will be required&#13;
before final subloan approval relate to the final status of participating enterprises, and the&#13;
counterpart finances and loan guarantees available for the subprojects' financing plans.&#13;
The project's EIA Summary Report with Resettlement Annex, approved by the National&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) and by MOA, respectively, has been approved&#13;
by the Bank. Investments for environmental mitigation plans have been finalized.&#13;
CADTIC has notified all sponsors of the loan terms and conditions.&#13;
I. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
2.32  The project will be implemented over a period of six years with a completion date&#13;
of December 31, 2001. Virtually all land development and civil works for new and&#13;
expanded production facilities will be carried out during the first two years. Procurement&#13;
of equipment for expansion or upgraded facilities will begin during the second half of the&#13;
first year, and for new facilities during the entire second year. By 1998, most of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
initial tranche of subprojects is expected to be approaching full operational production.&#13;
An implementation schedule for all components is given in Chart 3.4.&#13;
J. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
2.33     Project costs are summarized in Table 2.1  and detailed in Annex 2.3, Tables 1-4.&#13;
The total project costs are estimated at $310.3 million with a foreign exchange&#13;
component of $124.9 million or about 40.2 percent of the total project cost. Cost&#13;
estimates are based on the subproject pipeline prepared at appraisal, on quantities derived&#13;
from the preliminary designs and unit prices currently prevailing for similar construction&#13;
works in the project areas and from price lists of local and overseas manufacturers of&#13;
equipment and machinery. The base cost estimates are expressed in December 1995&#13;
prices and the exchange rate used to convert base cost estimates is Y 8.4 to $1. Price&#13;
contingencies of $9.3 million are included. Price contingencies for costs to be incurred in&#13;
foreign exchange are based on annual international price escalation rates of 2.0 percent&#13;
for 1996. 1.6 percent for 1997, 2.1 percent for 1998, 2.4 percent for 1999, 2.2 percent for&#13;
2000, and 2.5 percent for 2001. Price contingencies for costs to be incurred in Yuan are&#13;
based on annual domestic price escalation rates of 10.5 percent for 1996, 8.5 percent for&#13;
1997, 7 percent for 1998, 6.5 percent for 1999, and 6.2 percent for 2000 and 2001. The&#13;
physical contingencies, equivalent to $8.3 million, are based on an average rate of 5&#13;
percent for works, goods and services. Import duties and value-added taxes have been&#13;
included in costs. The total project financing includes interest during construction of&#13;
$17.1 million.&#13;

K. FINANCING&#13;
2.34 Single Currency Loan Option. The Government of China and CADTIC have&#13;
selected LIBOR-based US dollar-denominated single currency loan terms for the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
in order to facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of their borrowings by&#13;
more closely matching the currency of their liabilities with that of their net trade flows,&#13;
about 75 percent of which are US dollar-denominated. They selected the LIBOR-based&#13;
product in order to preserve the full maturity of the loan, compared to the fixed-rate&#13;
option that would have resulted in a 15-year loan. The Borrower judges that it can&#13;
manage any interest rate risk. China is eligible for single currency loans under the&#13;
expanded program. This loan, when added to other FY96 single currency loans approved&#13;
to date by the Board, represents about 24 percent of the fiscal year 1996 IBRD lending&#13;
program to China, well within the 50 percent volume guideline approved by the Board.&#13;
2.35  Financing Plan. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2.2. The total&#13;
financing required would amount to $327.4 million including interest during&#13;
construction. The proposed Bank loan would cover 45.8 percent of total financing&#13;
required, including 92.2 percent of foreign exchange costs and 13.1 percent of local costs.&#13;
The project's subborrowers will be required to finance, from equity, not less than 30&#13;
percent of total project costs (including incremental working capital requirement). In the&#13;
project pipeline, the sponsors' commitments amount to 33.3 percent of total project&#13;
financing requirement including about $17.8 million contribution in kind. About $7.3&#13;
million, representing about 2.2 percent of total financing, would be provided by&#13;
budgetary allocations of governments at all levels.  The balance of $61.1 million&#13;
equivalent, or 18.7 percent of total financing, would be borrowed from domestic banks.&#13;

L. PROCUREMENT&#13;
2.36  The procurement arrangements for this project are in line with previous Bank&#13;
Group practice for agricultural credit projects, and are summarized in Table 2.3.&#13;
Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the "Guidelines: Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits," January 1995. The participating enterprises will be&#13;
responsible for most procurement under the project.   Larger investments in&#13;
internationally-sourced equipment would be procured in accordance with International&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Procurement by ICB will be handled through the&#13;
procurement agency(ies) selected by CADTIC, in accordance to practices acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. Procurement for proprietary equipment would be by direct contacting. Other&#13;
goods would be procured by shopping procedures. CADTIC, as part of its procurement&#13;
plan, will prepare for Bank review the detailed shopping procedures it proposes to require&#13;
subborrowers to follow when procuring goods under this method.&#13;

(2) Other procurement methods include shopping, small works procurement,&#13;
direct contracting, training and consultant services.&#13;
(3) NBF denotes non-Bank financing.&#13;
2.37  Works. Works include mainly factory buildings, factory roads, environmental&#13;
protection works, and landscaping for a total of $53.0 million. National competitive&#13;
bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank would apply to $41.3 million of&#13;
contracts for buildings, each valued at $300,000 equivalent or above. Small works valued&#13;
below $300,000 equivalent per contract, applying to $1.1 million of building contracts,&#13;
would be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written&#13;
invitation.&#13;
2.38  Goods. Project goods consisting of machinery, equipment, materials, vehicles&#13;
(estimated at $7.5 million) and incremental working capital are estimated at $223.9&#13;
million. A total of $29.2 million, of which $1.7 million is Bank-financed, includes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
miscellaneous items. International technology transfer licenses would be paid against an&#13;
agreed schedule of production. Land acquisition, survey and design, monitoring and&#13;
supervision, management, increase power capacity, national technology transfer,&#13;
incremental staff salaries, duties and taxes, interest during construction would be locally&#13;
funded.&#13;
2.39 Various Procurement Methods.&#13;
(a)   Contracts each valued at $5 million equivalent or above would be procured&#13;
under ICB procedures. Domestic manufacturers would be allowed a margin&#13;
of preference equal to 15 percent of the CIF price of imported goods or the&#13;
actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less.&#13;
(b)   Contracts each valued below $5 million equivalent would be procured on&#13;
the basis of shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(c)   Proprietary equipment valued at $1.7 million in Bank financing would be&#13;
procured by direct contracting.&#13;
2.40 Training and Technical Assistance. Training and technical assistance would&#13;
amount to a total of $7.6 million for domestic and overseas training, national and&#13;
intemational consultants. Consultants under the project would be recruited in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency." Classification of training and technical assistance is&#13;
detailed in para. 2.52.&#13;
2.41  Bank Review. All ICB packages and NCB packages of $5 million or more would&#13;
be subject to the Bank's prior review. This limit would result in a prior review of 34&#13;
percent of all Bank-financed ICB and NCB contracts by value and would consist of&#13;
approximately four contracts. All contracts for proprietary items would also be subject to&#13;
the Bank's prior review. Other contracts would be subject to postreview by Bank&#13;
supervision missions. All contracts for consultant services of $100,000 or more for firms,&#13;
$50,000 or more for individuals, the terms of reference for consultancy services contracts,&#13;
single-source selection of consulting firms, assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably&#13;
determined by the Bank, amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting firms&#13;
raising the contract value to $100,000 equivalent or above and amendments to contracts&#13;
for the employment of individual consultants raising the contract value to $50,000&#13;
equivalent or above would be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval in&#13;
accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Contracts for prior review would be in English;&#13;
contracts in Chinese to be financed by the Bank would have a title page, outline of&#13;
contents and summary in English. Standard bidding documents will be used for all these&#13;
contracts. CADTIC will review compliance with the agreed procedures and coordinate&#13;
all ICB contracts and other contracts involving international supplier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
M. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
2.42  Subloans would finance up to 55 percent of total project cost of each subproject.&#13;
Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made at 100 percent of amounts paid by&#13;
CADTIC under subloans.&#13;
2.43  In order to provide for efficient disbursement of the Loan, a Special Account in&#13;
US dollars with an authorized allocation of $10 million (based on four months of average&#13;
disbursements) will be opened by CADTIC, in a bank acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly, or&#13;
whenever the Special Account is drawn down to 50 percent of its initial deposit,&#13;
whichever comes first. Retroactive financing of up to $5 million would be allowed for&#13;
payments made by CADTIC after January 1, 1996 and prior to the signing of the Loan&#13;
Agreement under subloans. Expenditures incurred earlier than 180 days prior to the date&#13;
the Bank receives the subloan application from CADTIC, would not be eligible for&#13;
financing under the Loan. All disbursements would be made against statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOE).&#13;
2.44  It is estimated that the project would be completed by December 31, 2001; the&#13;
closing date would be December 31, 2002. No new subloans would be approved after&#13;
December 31. 1999. Disbursement experience in China, including in the agriculture&#13;
sector and agribusiness subsector, has been favorable and above the Bank Group average.&#13;
The project disbursement profile is essentially in line with that for specific investment&#13;
loans in China. The estimated disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 2.5.&#13;
N. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
2.45  Reporting Requirements. Financial management for the project will be the&#13;
responsibility of the financial intermediary CADTIC, which will establish and monitor&#13;
accounts related to the project in accordance with the terms of reference set out in Annex&#13;
2.10. CADTIC will submit semiannual reports to PMO, which will be consolidated in&#13;
PMO's semiannual reports to the Bank covering the status of Loan disbursements and the&#13;
progress of the subprojects until the Loan is fully disbursed. Subproject management&#13;
teams will maintain records of expenditures on civil works, equipment and materials for&#13;
submission to CADTIC. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that CADTIC would&#13;
require subborrowers to maintain consolidated accounts for the entire enterprise that&#13;
would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IBRD, and submitted to CADTIC&#13;
within six months of the close of the financial year.&#13;
2.46 Audit Reports. CADTIC has engaged an auditor acceptable to the Bank, on&#13;
terms of reference also acceptable to the Bank, to conduct an annual audit of both project&#13;
accounts and CADTIC's consolidated accounts. The audit of project accounts will verify&#13;
the adequacy of the system to document the receipt and disbursement of project proceeds&#13;
by subproject, both annual and cumulative. The audit report will contain a separate&#13;
opinion on whether, based on documentation and internal controls, statements of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
expenditure can be relied upon to support related withdrawals. All audit reports will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the period of review.&#13;
0. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
2.47  Environmental Impact Assessment.  All subprojects were environmentally&#13;
screened by technical specialists from the central China Research Academy of&#13;
Environmental Sciences (CRAES), in collaboration with provincial Environmental&#13;
Protection Bureaus (EPBs) and Bank consultants. The project has been designated an&#13;
environmental impact A-rating due to the inclusion of two A-rated subprojects. An&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment Summary Report has been submitted to the Bank for&#13;
clearance and environmental impact, mitigation and monitoring plans for all 30&#13;
sponsoring enterprises have been prepared. The Report has been cleared by NEPA and&#13;
was sent to the Board of Directors on June 15, 1995. Because of the wide dispersion of&#13;
the subprojects across China, cumulative pollution buildup in one area will not occur.&#13;
The project's main environmental pollutants are confined to gaseous and particulate&#13;
smokestack emissions from the many small- to medium-size power units required to&#13;
drive factory production. Water pollutants are mostly confined to organic, biodegradable&#13;
pollutants. Equipment and facilities for the abatement of smoke and water pollutants&#13;
have been designed and included into the investment costs. Noise pollution in several&#13;
subprojects will be mitigated through equipment and factory insulation.   An&#13;
organizational structure and training programs have been developed to manage and&#13;
monitor environmental mitigation programs during implementation.  Local citizens&#13;
groups have been surveyed in each subproject area to ascertain their opinions regarding&#13;
the environmental impact of subprojects in their area.&#13;
2.48  The project will also exert a positive environmental impact through the&#13;
bioconversion of agroindustrial wastes or byproducts into high-protein feed stuffs and the&#13;
detoxification of rapeseed cake, thereby removing potential effluents from plant&#13;
discharges. The proposed wholesale markets will benefit the environment by preventing&#13;
overstocking, and resulting spoilage, of feed grains and additives, and the more efficient&#13;
marketing of commodities, resulting in reduced transportation and energy usage.&#13;
2.49  Fourteen subprojects, involving the conversion of oilseeds and agroindustrial&#13;
wastes into value-added enhanced-protein feedstuffs, will exert a beneficial rather than a&#13;
detrimental environmental effect.  The soybean irrigation pilot areas in Zhoukou&#13;
prefecture, Henan province are not expected to contribute significantly to the depletion of&#13;
groundwater and their irrigation water cost recovery principle will provide a model for&#13;
self-financed irrigation. The pesticides used for soybean or canola production will be&#13;
biodegradable. The development of a new surface phosphate mine at Xixi, Hunan&#13;
province has been preceded by a careful siting study with respect to effluent control,&#13;
watershed management, and ore transportation. Details of the environmental impact&#13;
monitoring plan are presented in Annex 2.6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
2.50  Resettlement. Acceptable resettlement principles and procedures, on the basis of&#13;
which resettlement plans for any subproject involving resettlement would be prepared, have&#13;
been prepared and submitted to the Bank. Of the 30 subprojects under preparation, seven&#13;
will require land acquisition that will impact on the sideline or main incomes of people&#13;
using this land for agriculture, vegetable cultivation, or fish rearing. A total of 20.5 ha of&#13;
land will be acquired for project activities, involving 325 persons belonging to 27 families.&#13;
The maximum number of persons affected in any given subproject is 114. None of these&#13;
have lost any housing. Generous compensation arrangements have been made by the&#13;
local governments or subproject sponsors for new land on which to continue crop or&#13;
vegetable cultivation, or for guaranteed jobs with either the new subproject or with a&#13;
village enterprise. Replacement subprojects will also be subject to the same resettlement&#13;
review as those in the original pipeline. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that,&#13;
where resettlement and land acquisition are required for a subproject, a resettlement&#13;
plan meeting principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank would be required as a&#13;
condition of subloan approval by CADTIC, and where more than 200 persons are&#13;
affected, the Bank 's prior approval of such plans would be required&#13;
2.51   Replacement Subprojects. As part of the evaluation of proposals for new&#13;
replacement subprojects, the review procedures as described above for environmental&#13;
assessment and resettlement will continue to form an integral part of the proposals'&#13;
review and approval process.&#13;
P. TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
2.52  The sunmmarized training program is found in Annex 2.9, Table 1.  Project&#13;
preparation-related training and technical assistance (TA) will be carried out by the&#13;
subproject enterprises, amounting to 15,200 person-months.&#13;
2.53   Each subproject management team would be responsible for developing and&#13;
implementing its own training program.&#13;
2.54  Institutional Strengthening of CADTIC. To address the institutional weakness&#13;
identified during the appraisal of CADTIC, CADTIC has undertaken to carry out an&#13;
institutional strengthening  program  in  the  following  areas:   (a) institutional&#13;
reorganization, related to consolidation of its credit department, the establishment of&#13;
credit review and corporate services departments, and the development of corporate&#13;
strategies to ensure capital adequacy and liquidity; (b) modemization of accounting&#13;
systems, through the conversion from a cash to an accrual system; (c) strengthening risk&#13;
management, through the development of new loan approval procedures, a credit system&#13;
review, information management systems, and long-term credit monitoring systems, and&#13;
improved subloan collection, and (d) development of a corporate services capability with&#13;
which to offer financial services to clients. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
CADTIC would employ by July 1, 1997 consultants with terms of reference, qualifications&#13;
and experience acceptable to the Bank to assist in carrying out the above activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.1   Introduction. The project's management structure is divided into two streams.&#13;
NFIO, representing the project's oversight ministry, MOA, will have administrative,&#13;
technical and feed subsector development-related responsibilities. CADTIC will be&#13;
responsible for all matters related to the management of Loan proceeds. A Project&#13;
Coordinating Committee comprising senior MOA and CADTIC managers will liaise&#13;
periodically with participating ministries and agencies for the purpose of alleviating&#13;
constraints impeding project implementation.&#13;
3.2   CADTIC will be responsible to make subloan decisions under the project, and to&#13;
oversee procurement, disbursement, supervision and collection. Future proposals to&#13;
replace any in the pipeline which drop out or prove unsatisfactory, or to be financed from&#13;
repayments by earlier subloans, will be appraised fully by CADTIC staff. Although&#13;
CADTIC is responsible for all subloan approvals, certain proposals will be submitted to&#13;
IBRD for approval prior to a final loan approval decision by CADTIC. These include:&#13;
(a) subloans in excess of $15 million in investment costs, and (b) the first subloan in each&#13;
of the six production components of the project, as well as the subloan for CFIC.&#13;
3.3   NFIO Project Management Office (PMO). A PMO has been established under&#13;
NFIO to ensure smooth transition to project implementation and to facilitate&#13;
communications and cooperation with CADTIC and among participating agencies.&#13;
During implementation, the PMO will provide sector policy guidance, liaise between&#13;
MOA and other project participants, monitor project implementation, provide technical&#13;
support to CADTIC in subproject identification and preparation, and serve as a&#13;
communications link between the Bank and the project implementation agencies&#13;
(CADTIC and CAU).&#13;
3.4   The PMO is headed by a Director and staffed with personnel with expertise in&#13;
project management, information systems, accounting and finance, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, feed sector technology, marketing, and project analysis. The PMO will be&#13;
responsible for the following functions:  (a) preparation of the annual work plan,&#13;
(b) evaluation of project monitoring and reporting systems to track physical and financial&#13;
progress and to report back to the Bank and the potential bilateral donor, (c) identification&#13;
of potential subprojects for possible financing by CADTIC, (d) liaison between other&#13;
project entities and funding agencies, and (e) assist the Bank in completing the&#13;
Implementation Completion Report and similar tasks for the bilateral donor agency.&#13;
Funding for the PMO will be provided through a portion of the project management fee&#13;
of 0.1 percent, to be levied on the total value of all disbursed subloans. These funds will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
be collected by CADTIC and deposited in an account designated by the PMO. CADTIC&#13;
will provide PMO with a quarterly accounting of these funds. An organization chart of&#13;
NFIO is presented in Chart 3.2. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
central PMO will be maintained with terms of reference, staffing and other resources&#13;
acceptable to Bank, and that CADTIC will maintain suitable arrangements with the PMO&#13;
to obtain its assistance as discussed above.&#13;
3.5   Project Coordinating Committee (PCC). The Committee will by chaired by a&#13;
Vice Minister and comprise the Director of NFIO's Project Management Office (PMO),&#13;
the Director of CADTIC's International Finance Department and the Director, Office of&#13;
External Economic Relations, MOA. The functions of the PCC will be (a) adoption and&#13;
monitoring of annual work plans, prepared by PMO, (b) periodic review of the overall&#13;
project implementation progress, including the effectiveness of the administrative and&#13;
consultative arrangements of the project, and (c) resolution of implementation issues that&#13;
impinge on the achievement of project objectives. The PCC will norrnally meet every&#13;
three moniths and more often as circumstances require.&#13;
3.6   Project Management Relationships.  The interrelationships between CADTIC&#13;
and the central PMO within NFIO, as described above, have been defined to ensure that the&#13;
technical, operational a well as financial management of the project will be adequately&#13;
addressed. NFIO will in essence serve as a technical resource to CADTIC, in particular&#13;
where pipeline subproject identification and technical assessment are concerned. PMO will&#13;
confine itself to the technical monitoring and evaluation of the project, and will consolidate&#13;
subproject progress reports received from CADTIC.&#13;
B. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.7   International Finance Department within CADTIC. CADTIC's International&#13;
Finance Department (CIFD) will perform the intermediation functions required by the&#13;
project unless and until such time as all of CADTIC's credit operations are reorganized&#13;
(para. 2.29). Financial intermediation shall be managed in accordance with the operation&#13;
procedures and onlending terms and conditions presented in Annex 3.1, which outlines&#13;
criteria for borrower eligibility and project activities, onlending terms, and pipeline&#13;
review. The Project Division under CIFD will remain responsible for the appraisal of all&#13;
subproject proposals and the supervision and collection of all subloans. Within the&#13;
overall scope of the agreed onlending terms and conditions the degree of risk exposure,&#13;
based on appraisal of the proposal, will determine the terms and conditions for each&#13;
subproject.&#13;
3.8   Accounting. CADTIC will maintain separate records to reflect the receipt and&#13;
disposition of all Loan proceeds, and will exert due diligence to ensure that Loan&#13;
proceeds are used solely for the purposes for which they are intended. CADTIC will also&#13;
maintain its operations and financial condition at all times in accordance with the&#13;
regulations of the People's Bank of China. CADTIC will adhere to these above-noted&#13;
matters in accordance with the operational details contained in Annex 3.1. Assurances&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that CADTIC would have its accounts audited annually by&#13;
an auditor acceptable to the Bank, and submit the audit report to the Bank not later than&#13;
six months after the close of each accounting period&#13;
3.9   Staffing. In order to ensure the timely processing of subloan applications under&#13;
the project, and ensure the adequacy of supervision, CADTIC intends to recruit an&#13;
additional four regular and four fixed-term project analysts for CIFD.&#13;
3.10 Flow of Funds. The Bank loan to China would be on standard Bank terms, with&#13;
20 years' maturity including 5 years' grace, at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based&#13;
US dollar-denominated single currency loans. Loan proceeds will be onlent from MOF&#13;
to CADTIC, under a subsidiary loan agreement in dollars, with 15 years' maturity,&#13;
including 5 years of grace, at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar-&#13;
denominated single currency loans, and commitment charges at the same rate as the Bank&#13;
loan.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the borrower would onlend the&#13;
proceeds of the Loan to CADTIC under a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IBRD, including those set out above. Conclusion of the&#13;
subsidiary loan agreement would be a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
3.11   Onlending Terms. For Subloans denominated in local currency, the interest&#13;
rate would be at the prevailing CADTIC rate for loans of similar maturity at the time the&#13;
subloan was approved. As reviewed in Chapter 1, these onlending rates are set by PBC&#13;
and the current interest rate structure ranges from 12 percent for investment loans less&#13;
than one year to 15 percent for investment loans greater than three years. CADTIC&#13;
would be responsible for the foreign exchange risk associated with these subloans and the&#13;
margin between the onlending rate and the cost of loan proceeds incorporates a spread to&#13;
cover cross-currency movements. For Bank subloans denominated in dollars, the interest&#13;
rate charged to subborrowers would be at the variable rate at which funds are onlent to&#13;
CADTIC by MOF plus an operating margin of 2.3 percent. Since PBC does not mandate&#13;
onlending rates for foreign exchange loans, there is greater flexibility to set these rates on&#13;
a market-approximating basis. In line with other World Bank intermediation projects in&#13;
China, the proposed project has followed the "cost plus" approach, in which the&#13;
onlending rate is determined by the actual market cost of capital (the IBRD loan) plus an&#13;
operating margin designed to cover administrative costs (1.2 percent), bad debt reserves&#13;
(0.5 percent), profit margin (0.5 percent), and project management costs (0.1 percent).&#13;
Based on current interest rates for LIBOR-based US dollar-denominated single currency&#13;
loans of 5.76 percent, the current onlending rate for foreign exchange subloans would&#13;
amnount to 8.06 percent (with all foreign exchange risk borne by the subborrowers). It is&#13;
expected that approximately half of the subloans would be made in local currency and&#13;
half in foreign exchange. CADTIC would also be allowed to levy fees for special&#13;
services and functions pertaining to loan appraisal as necessary, in accordance with&#13;
established practice. As an exception to the above, in view of the research orientation of&#13;
CFIC's feed mill, to be financed by CADTIC, the subloan for CFIC will be denominated in&#13;
dollars and will bear interest at the rate payable by CADTIC plus 0.5 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
3.12  While these onlending rates are currently slightly negative in real terms, they are&#13;
expected to be positive at the start of the project, as domestic inflation is projected to&#13;
decline from 15 percent in 1995 to 10- 11 percent in 1996. Rates are expected to remain&#13;
positive thereafter, based on World Bank projections of domestic inflation of 8-9 percent&#13;
for 1997 and 6-7 percent for 1998-2001. The World Bank will continue to monitor&#13;
closely the level and structure of interest rates as part of the ongoing sectoral policy&#13;
dialogue with government. One of the main channels for these discussions will continue&#13;
to be the FY93 Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project, which provides for&#13;
periodic consultations between the World Bank and government on the status of financial&#13;
sector reform.&#13;
3.13   Loan maturity will not exceed seven years and may include a grace period of up&#13;
to 24 months. Within these limits, the governing factor in determining the maturity on&#13;
any specific subloan would be the nature of the subproject and its projected cash flow, as&#13;
determined by CADTIC. CADTIC may require the borrower to comply with special&#13;
conditions on a subloan to mitigate specific weaknesses in what is otherwise a sound&#13;
investment proposal. CADTIC will require collateral for its subloans consistent with its&#13;
practices for similar enterprise activities outside the project.  Subloans may by&#13;
denominated in dollars, renminbi or a combination thereof. Further details on borrower&#13;
eligibility, project activity eligibility, and onlending terms are presented in Annex 3.1.&#13;
The subborrowers will assume any foreign exchange risks on subloans taken out in US&#13;
dollar currency. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that CADTIC would make&#13;
subloans in accordance with the onlending terms and conditions described above and the&#13;
eligibility requirements set out in Annex 3.1.&#13;
3.14  Loan Recoverv and Reflows. CADTIC will be solely responsible for loan&#13;
recovery, in accordance with the individual terms and conditions it negotiates with&#13;
individual subproject sponsors, and its terms of reference with the Bank and MOF.&#13;
Funds onlent by MOF to CADTIC will be repayable to MOF in 15 years. CADTIC will&#13;
therefore be able to relend recovered loan proceeds for the expansion of existing&#13;
subprojects or the establishment of new ones.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.15  Each subproject sponsor will appoint one or more persons or, depending on&#13;
enterprise size or already existing infrastructure, a unit responsible for environmental&#13;
monitoring. Sponsors will liaise with their county or provincial EPBs (depending on the&#13;
status of sponsoring enterprise) on technical matters and will report periodically to PMO,&#13;
which will liaise closely with staff of the China Research Academy of Environmental&#13;
Sciences (CRAES) as the project's senior EIA agency. The principal responsibilities of&#13;
the EPBs will be to advise subproject environmental management staff on (a) approval of&#13;
emission control design systems, (b) commissioning of pollution control facilities and&#13;
devices in accordance with approved designs and performance, (c) undertaking ongoing&#13;
effluent and ambient environmental monitoring, and (d) training for subproject technical&#13;
staff in the operation and monitoring of pollution control systems. Environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
monitoring indicators are included in the performance indicator schedule presented in&#13;
Annex 3.2. Subloans made by CADTIC for any subproject require prior approval of the&#13;
subproject's environmental assessment report by the EPB with jurisdiction over that&#13;
subproject; routine subloan supervision will include a verification from that EPB that&#13;
subproject construction and operation conforms to the agreed environmental management&#13;
plan. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that as a condition of subloan approval by&#13;
CADTIC, the subproject for which the subloan is made would have to be in compliance&#13;
with Chinese environmental laws.&#13;
D. MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES&#13;
3.16  Enterprise Autonomy. The management of project farms, agribusinesses or&#13;
factories will be conducted by experienced management teams with responsibility for all&#13;
aspects of company operations. The sponsoring corporations of the two agriculture&#13;
subprojects (Annex 2.11) will rely on the Bureaus of Water Conservancy, Animal&#13;
Husbandry and Agriculture for all crop production and support services activities. The&#13;
soybean and rapeseed processing plants under these subprojects will be managed by&#13;
qualified, contracted managers, granted effective management autonomy over their&#13;
production units.  Similarly, the five participating integrated feed and livestock&#13;
agribusiness sponsors (Annex 2.11 ) will each adopt an autonomous management&#13;
structure supervised by a Board of Directors, subdivided into operations and corporate&#13;
management divisions representing profit centers, and employing contract producers.&#13;
3.17  Agricultural Production Inputs.  Fertilizers, agrochemicals, production and&#13;
irrigation equipment, and fuels will be procured directly by subsponsors where they are&#13;
authorized to do so, or by a CADTIC designated procurement agent for the region or&#13;
commodity in question. Feed additives and feed grains to be used for feed compounding&#13;
or storage and distribution will be procured directly via commercial channels through&#13;
negotiated forward contracts with suppliers, Grain Bureau depots, or commodity&#13;
wholesale markets. Annual procurement plans for the two agriculture subprojects will be&#13;
prepared by all subproject management teams for the intended procurement of fertilizer,&#13;
agrochemicals and fuel, showing cropping patterns, cropping and cultivated area. The&#13;
Bureau of Water Conservancy in Henan will remain responsible for the planning,&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance of the irrigation systems, and for the monitoring of&#13;
groundwater tables in the project area.&#13;
3.18  Livestock Production and Aquaculture. The production of livestock, poultry&#13;
and fish will be carried out under contract by qualified households. Technical support&#13;
and marketing services to sustain contract production will be provided by the subproject&#13;
companies. These will also supply starter pigs or poultry, fingerlings and feed, and will&#13;
purchase back the livestock and poultry to supply their processing plants or to market&#13;
directly. Equitable production contracts will be prepared for participating producers,&#13;
outlining the extent and cost of services provided, and the basis for determining prices for&#13;
agricultural or livestock production inputs and outputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
E. PROJECT LAUNCH WORKSHOP&#13;
3.19  Bank and government specialists will conduct a project launch workshop in either&#13;
Beijing or Guangzhou, at a date to be determined near the onset of implementation, for all&#13;
central and subproject management teams and for CADTIC and NFIO staffs. The&#13;
purpose of the workshop will be to familiarize participants with final project details, and&#13;
review the total program for implementation and to clarify individual tasks and&#13;
responsibilities at each level. Topics to be covered will include final subloan approval&#13;
procedures, procurement and disbursement procedures, project and financial&#13;
management, monitoring and evaluation, and environmental impact assessment.&#13;
F. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING&#13;
3.20  Monitoring and Evaluation. The four broad key monitoring indicator categories&#13;
with which to track project implementation include, (a) physical and financial project&#13;
performance, (b) capacity building, (c) feed sector strengthening, and (d) enterprise reform.&#13;
These categories are in turn subdivided into indicators monitoring the seven project&#13;
components, as well as categories of special interest, including, (i) enterprise&#13;
transformation, (ii) environmental impact assessment, (iii) resettlement, (iv) training and&#13;
technical assistance, technology acquisition, and (v) the performance of CADTIC.&#13;
Performance indicators for agriculture subprojects will cover irrigation canals and wells&#13;
constructed, crop yields, costs of production and contract household labor utilizations and&#13;
incomes. Agribusiness and agroprocessing subprojects will report on plant construction&#13;
progress, plant outputs, costs of production, number of persons trained, product quality at&#13;
commercial-scale production, product standards, and marketing. Wholesale markets will&#13;
report on volumes and value of feed commodities traded and information services&#13;
provided. The sector development component will report on amount and type of training&#13;
completed, progress made with the national training network, quantity of product testing&#13;
achieved and results of such testing, and expert committee activities related to policy&#13;
development and other relevant matters. A tabulated performance indicator schedule is&#13;
presented in Annex 3.2. A field supervision plan is presented in Annex 3.3.&#13;
3.21   Project Implementation Plan (PIP).  With combined inputs from  NFIO,&#13;
CADTIC and the Bank a PIP has been prepared which outlines the proposed organization&#13;
and management of the project, an implementation plan for procurement and&#13;
disbursement, and a monitoring and evaluation plan, including performance indicators.&#13;
The project's financial project management comprising subloan appraisal and approval,&#13;
accounting and auditing has been outlined. Performance indicators to monitor project&#13;
implementation and to assist in supervision were tabulated in categories including Special&#13;
Objective Indicators (enterprise reform, environmental impact mitigation, training and&#13;
skills development, participation by women, financial intermediary performance, and&#13;
technology acquisition). Other, broader project implementation indicators include overall&#13;
project and subproject performance.  Major loan covenants are included, as is a&#13;
supervision schedule.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
3.22  Within the first two years of the project, all subprojects will complete a survey&#13;
concerning progress made in enterprise transformation, new-technology development and&#13;
efficacy, and marketing. Both agriculture projects will carry out, before the mid-term&#13;
review, a project area assessment related to the technical and economic feasibility of&#13;
improved soybean and rape seed production and processing in their areas. These surveys&#13;
will form the baseline from which to effect midterm changes. Assurances were obtained&#13;
at negotiations that (a) a mid-term report on project progress will be prepared by NFIO&#13;
and provided to the Bank before December 31, 1997, from presentations prepared by the&#13;
PMO and subproject sponsors; (b) thereafter, the report would be discussed with the&#13;
Bank and actions taken to ensure the achievement of the project's objectives,&#13;
(c) semiannual progress reports will be prepared by PMO for submission to IBRD within&#13;
three months of the end of each half year; and (d) an implementation completion report&#13;
containing final assessment of the project and plan for the continued achievement of&#13;
project objectives will be submitted to IBRD within six months of the closing date.&#13;
3.23  Reporting. Technical and administrative project progress will be documented by&#13;
the individual subproject sponsors which will report the relevant physical and financial&#13;
progress data, according to the indicators set out in Annex 3.2, to PMO for consolidation&#13;
and final analysis, from which PMO will prepare periodic progress reports for CADTIC&#13;
and the Bank on the overall impact and benefits of the project. Based on data provided&#13;
by each subproject management team, CADTIC will monitor physical and financial&#13;
performance indicators which will be submitted to PMO for forwarding to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
4. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES&#13;
A. PRODUCTION&#13;
4.1   Because of the diversity of subproject activities, production outputs of the project&#13;
vary greatly in type and quantity. The development of marketing plans for project&#13;
outputs has received considerable analysis and the improvement of marketing skills and&#13;
strategies will be addressed in the project.&#13;
4.2   Soybean Production and Processing. Production from 133,300 ha of project&#13;
area will generate 290,000 tpa of soybeans. Together with soybeans from nonproject&#13;
areas, the project will process per year 6,600 t of extruded high-protein meal; 29,700 t of&#13;
refined soybean oil; and 177,000 t of soybean meal in three grades, leaving 190,000 t of&#13;
unprocessed soybeans for bulk storage and direct marketing. Organizational restructuring&#13;
is in progress to achieve well-managed, integrated large-area soybean production. Under&#13;
the sponsoring Zhoukou Soybean Development Corporation the operations of several&#13;
participating government agencies will be combined, including the Bureaus of Animal&#13;
Husbandry, Agriculture, Water Conservancy and Domestic Trade, and county-owned&#13;
processing plants.  The Corporation will reorganize into a shareholding company&#13;
comprising specific profit centers, including research and development, technical services&#13;
support, inputs supply, irrigation, seed and commercial production, agroprocessing, bulk&#13;
storage and marketing.&#13;
4.3   Canola Production and Processing. The project area encompasses five counties&#13;
in which 93,400 ha will be planted under commercial (66,700 ha) and demonstration or&#13;
research canola (26,700 ha). The project will also support the incremental production of&#13;
i00 t of canola premium seed and 100,000 t of commercial canola, to be processed into&#13;
18,800 t of canola oil and 29,700 t of canola meal for livestock feeding. The balance of&#13;
29,000 t will be marketed in unprocessed form for processing elsewhere.&#13;
4.4   Integrated Feed and Livestock Production.  The five feed and livestock&#13;
production subprojects, to be located in Hainan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Sichuan and Hunan&#13;
provinces, will generate at full production an annual output of 40,000 t of premix;&#13;
195,000 t of protein concentrate; 355,000 t of compound feed; 2,500 breeding pigs; 5.48&#13;
million day-old chicks; I million ducklings; and 5,700 t of fish.&#13;
4.5   Participating sponsors will, where warranted, reorganize into vertically integrated&#13;
feed milling and livestock production enterprises, supported by in-house technical&#13;
services programs, contract livestock production by participating farmers, and improved&#13;
agribusiness management.  The project will establish new industry standards for&#13;
improved feed conversion efficiency and feed utilization. Livestock, fish and poultry will&#13;
be produced by participating households under contract to nucleus enterprises. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
nucleus enterprises will provide support services comprising animal health, life-cycle&#13;
nutrition services and husbandry practices, and marketing.&#13;
4.6   Under this component, four existing feed mills are proposed for rehabilitation&#13;
with the specific objective of providing, on a pilot basis, models for successfully&#13;
upgrading outdated mill equipment, improving mill management, and instituting quality&#13;
control and marketing programs. These objectives are in line with feed subsector study&#13;
recommendations to increase the efficiency of existing, rather than the creation of new&#13;
feed mill capacity.&#13;
4.7   Enhanced-Protein Feed Production. Comprising 14 separate subprojects, the&#13;
enhanced-protein feed production component will generate annually, at full production,&#13;
290,000 t of detoxified rapeseed meal; 15,800 t of detoxified cottonseed meal; 61,000 t of&#13;
single-cell protein feed; 10,000 t of meat and bone meal; and 2,300 t of miscellaneous&#13;
animal byproducts. The conversion of agroindustrial byproducts into enhanced-protein&#13;
feedstuffs requires considerable research and development, linked to stringent in-plant&#13;
quality control.&#13;
4.8   Feed Additives Production. The incremental annual output of feed additives,&#13;
with all subprojects at full production, will comprise 200 t of 98 percent feed grade&#13;
riboflavin (vitamin B2); 30,000 t of dicalcium phosphate feed mineral, 5,000 t of feed&#13;
lysine and 30 t of purified pharmaceutical-grade lysine, with as byproducts 7,600 t of&#13;
fertilizer and 1,260 t of calcium fluorosilicate.&#13;
4.9   Feed Processing Equipment Manufacture. The combined incremental annual&#13;
output at full production of the three manufacturing plants comprising this component&#13;
will include 50 units of medium- to large-scale feed compounding and premix blending&#13;
equipment; 567 units of assorted feed processing, transportation and conveyor equipment;&#13;
36,000 pellet rolls and 24,800 pelleting dies. Equipment and parts manufacture will be&#13;
upgraded by the introduction of innovative technologies and manufacturing processes,&#13;
including a robotics welding line for the mass production of machinery, multiple hard-&#13;
steel drill assemblies, and a special oxygenation process for the tempering of steel for&#13;
pellet die production.&#13;
4.10  Feed Commodity Wholesale Markets.  Two trading facilities will be&#13;
established, in Beijing and Guangzhou. The Beijing market will move annually 5.8&#13;
million tons of corn and other grains products; 165,000 t of fish meal and 7.4 t of feed&#13;
additives, for a trade profit of $3.3 million. The Guangzhou market will trade 2.4 million&#13;
tons of feed grains and feed additives per year, netting a profit of Y 1.8 million.&#13;
B. MARKETS&#13;
4.11   Special emphasis has been placed on market development as the basis for&#13;
subproject enterprise development. Markets for subproject outputs have been evaluated&#13;
on the basis of a variety of market needs such as breeding stock and feed additives;&#13;
producer demand, such as for premixes, enhanced-protein feed commodities, and for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
producer services, including wholesale markets and technical support services; sector&#13;
development innovations or new technologies, such as single-cell protein feed&#13;
development, the technology development finance facility, and improved feed processing&#13;
equipment.&#13;
Agricultural Products&#13;
4.12  Soybeans and Soybean Products. There currently exists a severe shortage of&#13;
soybeans and soybean products both in and outside the project areas. Extruded soybean&#13;
meal for inclusion into grower feeds for young livestock and poultry are expected to find&#13;
ready local markets in Henan province which is ranked fourth nationally in terms of&#13;
livestock inventory. In the project area, Zhoukou prefecture, the feed protein shortfall is&#13;
300,000 t per year, edible oil supply is less than 10 percent of potential demand, and there&#13;
are no large-scale soybean oil extraction or processing plants.  Increased soybean&#13;
production in Zhoukou has been principally hampered by the absence of such processing&#13;
facilities, a constraint the project intends to address by the establishment of a 60,000 tpa&#13;
soybean oil extraction plant. Inside the project area, 183,600 t of processed soybean&#13;
products will be marketed, with 190,000 t designated for seed and marketing outside&#13;
Zhoukou through forward contracts with large feed mills. These contracts have already&#13;
been confirmed.&#13;
4.13  Canola Seed and Canola Products. Based on a marketing study carried out by&#13;
the Bank in Hubei province, the current consumer demand for rapeseed-derived oil in&#13;
Huanggang prefecture is 111,000 tpa. Assuming a 60 percent market share for canola oil,&#13;
only 41 percent of prefectural demand was met in 1993, leaving considerable potential for&#13;
increased production and sales. Insufficient canola seed production and distribution, poor&#13;
processing technology, and the near absence of promotional marketing have been severe&#13;
constraints in popularizing canola over traditional high-toxin rapeseed. Project-supported&#13;
canola processing linked to market development through promotional feeding trials will&#13;
be important marketing objectives. Marketing surveys indicate that feed millers and&#13;
livestock producers will pay a premium price of at least 15 percent over traditional&#13;
rapeseed meal prices, if a reliable supply were available.&#13;
Integrated Feed and Livestock Agroenterprises&#13;
4.14 Combined Project Region Demand. The south China region in which the five&#13;
subprojects under this component are to be located has a total livestock feed demand of&#13;
52.9 million tpa, balanced by an available feed supply of 39.8 million tpa, for a shortfall&#13;
of 13.1 million tpa. Manufactured feed production in 1993 reached 7.2 million tons.&#13;
Individual provinces have feed supply deficits ranging from only 0.2 million tpa (Jiangxi)&#13;
to 8.1 million tpa (Sichuan); none have feed surpluses.&#13;
4.15  Feed Products. The output of premix and concentrate feeds produced by the&#13;
project in the region will satisfy 19 percent of overall regional requirements. The&#13;
enterprises within the project region will utilize one-third of their own premix and one-&#13;
sixth of their protein concentrate output for the manufacture of compound feeds. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
will leave 26,400 tpa of premix for marketing in the project region, sufficient for the&#13;
production of 528,000 t of compound feed, which will cover only seven percent of the&#13;
region's feed requirements. Of the 195,000 tpa of protein concentrate to be produced,&#13;
32,500 tpa will be used by the project enterprises, leaving 162,500 tpa for blending, at a&#13;
1:4 ratio, into 812,500 tpa of complete feed, covering 11 percent of regional&#13;
requirements.&#13;
4.16  Poultry Production and Processing. The proposed poultry processing plant&#13;
attached to the Beihai subproject will be the first such facility in the region, and its entire&#13;
output of 11,000 t of broiler meat will be sold locally. The project city of Beihai is a&#13;
relatively small but rapidly commercializing municipality due to its status as a Special&#13;
Economic Zone and its proximity to the large trading centers of Shenzhen and Hong&#13;
Kong. If Beihai's population growth slows to half its current rate during the last two&#13;
years of the project, it will reach 720,000. Broiler meat supply from the project plant will&#13;
then contribute 15 kg per capita annually. Consumer preference for fresh over frozen&#13;
poultry will readily replace frozen chicken now being retailed. Moreover, the project&#13;
broilers are a cross between a local poultry variety and an imported Israeli strain (Kabir),&#13;
which are heavily favored locally because of their superior taste.&#13;
4.17 River Carp. Intensified freshwater (pond or river) fish production in Sichuan in&#13;
1992 amounted to 300,000 t, for a provincial annual per capita consumption of 2.5 kg/&#13;
year; well below the China average of 6.5 kg. In Sichuan, the subproject sponsor&#13;
Tongwei Corporation is using cage-reared carp production technology, and specialty&#13;
pelleted fish feeds to maximize production. Sichuan production of fish feeds in 1994 was&#13;
122,000 tpa, of which Tongwei produced only 10,000 t on a pilot basis in 1993. At a&#13;
documented feed conversion rate of 1:1.3, this tonnage will satisfy the production&#13;
demand of only 13,000 t of cage-reared carp. Tongwei intends to increase its carp&#13;
production to 2,000 tpa under the project, and increase carp feed production and sales,&#13;
thereby assuming a lead role in this rapidly growing market.&#13;
4.18  Fingerlings. The 1993 Sichuan demand for freshwater fingerlings (of all species)&#13;
was 3.5 billion of which only 2.45 billion were produced in Sichuan, with 1.05 billion&#13;
brought in from other provinces. Under the project, Tongwei Corporation intends to&#13;
establish a fingerling nursery to support the contract production of river carp, thereby&#13;
assuring the needed fingerling supply.&#13;
4.19  Cage-Reared Sea Grouper. The Hainan subproject sponsor intends to produce&#13;
650 t of sea grouper per year at a production cost of Y 12.5/kg, transported and sold live&#13;
to the restaurant trade in Hong Kong at Y 62.5/kg. Even with a periodically high&#13;
mortality rate, this margin will ensure profitability. Contracts with Hong Kong buyers&#13;
are already in place.&#13;
4.20  Lean Pigs.  The contract production of 500,000 lean pigs by the Minxing&#13;
Corporation in Jiangxi will be designated for local (77,000 head) and export (23,000&#13;
head) marketing, and local processing (400,000 head). Jiangxi province has a lean pig&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
export quota, mainly to Hong Kong, of 200,000 head per year, of which 177,000 head&#13;
have been allocated, leaving room for the export of 23,000 head at premium prices from&#13;
Y 5.5 to Y 6.5/kg, payable in foreign exchange. A I million head/year pig slaughter and&#13;
processing plant, to be financed outside the project, will process 400,000 project-&#13;
produced pigs, with the balance to be procured from suppliers outside the project. The&#13;
sale by Minxing Corporation in Jiangxi of 774,000 commercial pigs will release 56,000 t&#13;
of dressed premium pork on the Jiangxi market. The 1993 per capita consumption of&#13;
pork in Jiangxi was 38.2 kg, to which the incremental 56,000 t of project-generated pork&#13;
will add only I kg per capita.&#13;
4.21  The improved breeding pigs produced by Yunshan State Farm Corporation in&#13;
Hunan province, which will be raised by contracted state farm households and sold&#13;
directly to commercial pig farmers, will find a ready market in that province.&#13;
Requirement for quality lean replacement pigs in Hunan is estimated at 29,000 per year,&#13;
of which the project will supply only 8.6 percent.&#13;
4.22  Enhanced-Protein Feed Synthesis.  This component supports an annual&#13;
production and marketing of 418,000 t of enhanced-protein feeds in nine provinces,&#13;
comprising Sichuan (25,000 t), Guizhou (25,000 t), Jiangxi (60,000 t), Hubei (60,000 t),&#13;
Jiangsu (60,000 t), Anhui (60,000 t), Shandong (16,000 t), Hebei (60,000 t) and Hunan&#13;
(52,000 t). The Shandong subproject, employing foreign-licensed technology, will sell its&#13;
product in the northeast China market which contains the large livestock production belts&#13;
surrounding Beijing and Tianjin.  By virtue of the product's superior quality and&#13;
relatively limited supply, premium prices can be ensured. The Hebei subproject sponsor&#13;
will sell its 60,000 t of end-product primarily in the nearby Beijing market, which is only&#13;
48 percent self-sufficient in animal feed and relies heavily on feedstuff imports from&#13;
other regions. The Hunan subproject will produce detoxified oilseed meal and animal-&#13;
derived protein meal, for which demand is high by virtue of its high (70 percent) protein&#13;
content and quality. The combined requirements for protein feeds in the four provinces&#13;
of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi and Hubei, which, due to their proximity, can be considered to&#13;
constitute a trading region are estimated at 13 million tons of protein feed. The project-&#13;
generated output of 240,000 t enhanced protein feed products will satisfy only 2 percent&#13;
of these requirements.&#13;
Feed Additives&#13;
4.23  Feed Vitamin B2. The demand for feed grade vitamin B2 in China is projected at&#13;
275 t in 1996, rising to 400 t by 2000. Existing companies in China presently produce&#13;
60 tpa. The proposed vitamin B2 subproject will produce 200 tpa, which will supply&#13;
most of the projected domestic demand. By virtue of its efficient production technology,&#13;
the sponsoring company has proven it can produce and sell vitamin B2 at $3/kg below the&#13;
world market price of $66/kg.&#13;
4.24  Lysine. China presently manufactures only 6,000 tpa of feed grade lysine from&#13;
four plants, of which the subproject's sponsor presently produces 3,000 tpa.  An&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
additional estimated 10,000 tpa of lysine is being imported. With an estimated domestic&#13;
lysine demand of 31,000 tpa, the incremental production of 7,000 t will supply 23 percent&#13;
of current demand. At $2,700/t, lysine imports pose a substantial foreign exchange&#13;
constraint to rural feed producers. The sponsor has proven its ability to produce and sell&#13;
lysine at $1 00/ton below world market prices.&#13;
4.25 Dicalcium Phosphate Feed Mineral. The estimated national demand for&#13;
dicalcium phosphate (DCP) stands at 116,000 tpa. Most calcium-phosphate feed mineral&#13;
in China is produced in the form of tricalcium phosphate (TCP), a mineral nutritionally&#13;
inferior to DCP. The subproject's sponsor proposes to market 30,000 tpa of high quality&#13;
DCP, or 26 percent of estimated market demand.&#13;
Feed Processing Equipment&#13;
4.26  Pelleting Dies and Rollers. Estimated domestic requirements for pelleting dies&#13;
and rollers, two essential high-quality steel replacement parts in feed pelleting equipment,&#13;
are estimated at 35,000 and 50,000 units per year, respectively, assuming 1,000 operating&#13;
hours (one-third the operating time of imported, quality steel dies) per die assembly. The&#13;
combined total output of dies and rollers proposed to be manufactured by the two&#13;
sponsors is 30,000 and 36,000 units, respectively, providing a high degree of domestic&#13;
market demand coverage. At prices one-half those of imported parts, both domestic and&#13;
export marketing should be feasible, provided that steel quality, previously inferior to that&#13;
of imported dies, is maintained, thereby approaching the operating time of imported dies.&#13;
The proposed high production output for dies and rollers can be justified on the basis of&#13;
the time period required to replace all existing substandard dies; and the rapidly&#13;
increasing demand for pelleted feed, requiring increasing quantities of die assemblies.&#13;
4.27  Feed Processing Equipment. The annual domestic demand for large-capacity&#13;
(&gt;10 tph) feed processing equipment is estimated at 100 complete units per year,&#13;
including replacements. The project will manufacture 50 such units, supplying one-half&#13;
of China's annual demand up to year 2000. Provided quality steel and designs are used,&#13;
these units, at one-half the cost of imported equipment, will sell well.&#13;
Wholesale Commodity Markets&#13;
4.28  The wholesale commodity markets will satisfy a feed industry demand for&#13;
regional trading markets in which buyers and sellers can exchange feed ingredients and&#13;
receive price information. The Beijing wholesale market will trade principally in feed&#13;
grains from the northeast, with the Guangzhou market trading more intensively in feed&#13;
additives which enter China via Hong Kong. It is estimated that either market could, at&#13;
full operation, cover an estimated 30 percent of the regional (north or south China) feed&#13;
commodity trade. The markets will not compete with existing grain markets as their&#13;
commodities are sufficiently specific not to be traded in a similarly organized fashion on&#13;
other trading floors. The rapid development of electronic marketing networks, linking&#13;
buyers and sellers, will be a prime factor in the success of the markets. Their strategic&#13;
location in north and south China will allow for advantageous market coverage of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
specific commodities. As communication and trade networks develop, more and more&#13;
trade in these commodities is expected to take place between individual buyers and&#13;
sellers, gradually obviating the market service which is now so important. By that time,&#13;
perhaps in ten years, these markets will have evolved into full-fledged commodity futures&#13;
markets, with a price hedging function, or they will cease to function. In either case, the&#13;
infrastructure to be supported by the project will have continued economic use in a&#13;
variety of commercial applications.&#13;
C. PRICES&#13;
4.29   Output Prices.  Financial output prices for the outputs of the project by&#13;
component are presented in Annex 4.1. Even though there has been a recent reemergence&#13;
of increased state-controlled grain trading and pricing in response to high rates of&#13;
inflation in food prices, feed commodities and compound feeds continue to be sold&#13;
without quota at free market prices. Due to the increasing demand for feed commodities&#13;
and the lagging production of manufactured feeds, feed prices have been rising rapidly in&#13;
most regions. Contract farmers will sell their outputs at negotiated or free market prices&#13;
or, in the case of contracts with parent enterprises, at farm-gate prices agreed upon in the&#13;
production contract. High-value fish, equipment and feed additives destined for export&#13;
will be sold at international prices.&#13;
4.30  Input Prices. Prices for the inputs of the project by component can be found in&#13;
Annex 4.1. Domestic inputs for all components will be procured at market prices.&#13;
Market input and output prices were used in production budgets and financial analyses.&#13;
Prices used for grains, feed additives and chemicals, agroprocessing, feed milling,&#13;
additives and equipment manufacture, less transportation and handling costs, represent&#13;
prices estimated to prevail in 1995 and reflect farm-gate and factory-gate prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45 -&#13;
5. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   Sector Leadership.  The major benefit of the proposed project will be a&#13;
strengthened animal feed sector.  Through an ambitious, sector-wide program  of&#13;
managerial, technical and financial upgrading and innovation, the project proposes to&#13;
increase the capacity of the feed sector to meet the needs of a growing livestock industry.&#13;
Through the coordination of training, research and policy planning efforts, the project&#13;
will establish an environment focused on integrating China's diverse animal feed&#13;
requirements into a cohesive strategy for self-sufficiency.&#13;
5.2   Directly linked to these sector strengthening initiatives will be project-supported&#13;
domestic production capacity building for essential feed commodities and support&#13;
services. Institutional strengthening will be supported under NFIO and CFIC through:&#13;
(a) feed sector human resource development related to training and skills development,&#13;
(b) policy and planning and quality control, (d) new feed product testing, (d) commodity&#13;
wholesale market development, (e) the financing of new technology research and&#13;
development. The production of essential commodities will involve: (a) the introduction&#13;
of vertically integrated feed and livestock agribusiness development, (b) feed additives&#13;
and feed processing equipment design and manufacture, and (c) enhanced-protein feed&#13;
production and protein feed crop production and processing. It will also directly increase&#13;
incomes, employment and living standards of crop and livestock production households&#13;
and employees attached to project enterprises.&#13;
5.3   Incremental Project Output.  At full production of the first group of 30&#13;
subprojects, the project will annually generate 44,650 tons of feed additives valued at&#13;
$31.9 million; 290,000 t of unprocessed soybeans valued at $72.5 million; 47,850 t of&#13;
soybean and canola oils valued at $59.5 million; 1,160 units of processing equipment and&#13;
48,960 equipment components valued at $42.2 million; 471,800 t of premix, protein&#13;
concentrate and compound feeds valued at $175.6 million; 342,500 pigs, 12.4 million&#13;
day-old chicks and market poultry valued at $22.0 million; 11,950 t of fresh- and&#13;
saltwater fish valued at $20.8 million; 6,350 t of processed poultry meat valued at $9&#13;
million; 288,900 t of soybean and canola meal valued at $59.5 million; and 389,000 t of&#13;
enhanced-protein feeds valued at $79.4 million. Two wholesale markets will turn over&#13;
8.4 million tons of feed commodities per year, valued at a commission fee of $5.1&#13;
million. The project's annual incremental gross production value at full production will&#13;
be $577.5 million. Incremental project outputs are presented in Annex 5.4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
B. EMPLOYMENT AND INCOMES&#13;
5.4   Employment. The project will directly increase employment and living standards&#13;
of over 1.4 million crop and livestock production households and about 6,700 employees&#13;
attached to the subproject pipeline prepared at appraisal. Women are estimated to occupy&#13;
31 percent of the incremental employment positions generated by the project. This&#13;
percentage is well above the 15 percent norm of women's employment in the feed sector,&#13;
as quoted by NFIO. At full development, crop and livestock farming activities under the&#13;
agriculture and vertically integrated agribusiness components will create incremental&#13;
employment for over 600,000 farmers. This increased production will, in turn, create&#13;
additional employment opportunities in marketing, processing, transportation, input&#13;
supply and consumer services.&#13;
5.5   Rural Incomes. The project will have a positive impact on the incomes of the&#13;
crop and livestock households engaged in soybean and canola crop production, and in&#13;
contract pig, poultry or fish production. An analysis of household production models for&#13;
with-project livestock and protein crop production indicates increases in annual net&#13;
incomes ranging from 16 percent to 159 percent over before-project status. Summary&#13;
results for household production models are presented in Annex 5. 1.&#13;
C. COST RECOVERY&#13;
5.6   Cost recovery under the project will take several forms. The cost of technical&#13;
support services to contract pig, poultry and fish producers will be borne by the parent&#13;
companies as part of their production or sales-services costs and will be recovered&#13;
through the margin they earn on their products. The operation cost of the China Feed&#13;
Industry Center, totaling Y 2.4 million per year at full operation, will be recovered from&#13;
revenues derived from the sale of feed, laboratory and consulting fees, feed testing fees,&#13;
and training fees.  Cost recovery of training centers established under two of the&#13;
vertically integrated feed and livestock production subprojects will be borne by the&#13;
sponsoring companies as part of their product promotion budgets. Cost recovery for&#13;
improved irrigation under the Zhoukou soybean development subproject will be achieved&#13;
through water charges to participating farmers. Cost recovery from the subprojects will&#13;
depend principally on the rate of subloan repayment. Given the combination of intensive&#13;
technical and financial evaluation by Bank-managed consultant teans of each subproject&#13;
proposed for the initial pipeline, and CADTIC's own stringent evaluation and&#13;
creditworthiness investigations, this rate is expected to be greater than 95 percent.&#13;
D. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
5.7   As part of project preparation, the World Bank and NFIO jointly conducted a&#13;
detailed financial review of 26 of the 30 indicative subprojects in the lending pipeline.&#13;
These subprojects are merely illustrative of the range of investments to be financed under&#13;
the project and the final responsibility for selection and appraisal rests with CADTIC.&#13;
First, the past financial performance of all the existing enterprises was examined and the&#13;
following historical tables were prepared for 1991-93: financial ratios (covering short-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
termn liquidity, capital structure and long-term solvency, operating performance, and asset&#13;
utilization), income statement and balance sheet, and related breakdowns of operating&#13;
revenues and expenses, marketing costs, general and administrative costs, and&#13;
nonoperating income and expenses.  Second, financial projections of the proposed&#13;
subproject investments were prepared for a 10-year period, including income statements,&#13;
cashflow statements, financing plans, debt service analysis, and related breakdowns of&#13;
operating revenues and expenses, capital investment plans, indirect expenses, and taxes&#13;
and depreciation. A sample financial review for one subproject is included as Annex 5.2.&#13;
Table 4.&#13;
5.8   The financial projections indicate that all of the indicative subprojects generate&#13;
healthy financial rates of return (FRR), net present values, and debt service coverage&#13;
ratios. As summarized in Table I of Annxe 5.2, the subproject FRRs range from 14 to 42&#13;
percent, including 4 subprojects with FRRs between 14 and 19 percent, 16 with FRRs&#13;
between 20 and 29 percent, and 6 with FRRs in excess of 30 percent. Sensitivity analysis&#13;
confirmns that these findings are relatively robust to wide changes in key parameters, such&#13;
as increased investment costs, lower product prices, and implementation delays.&#13;
5.9   The cashflow projections for the indicative subprojects were then aggregated to&#13;
estimate the average FRRs of the seven project components. The Feed Processing&#13;
Equipment Component generates the lowest FRR, 18 percent, reflecting the lower returns&#13;
characteristic of the machine, tool, and die industry in China and the world; the Feed&#13;
Commodity Wholesale Market Component generates the highest FRR, 37 percent,&#13;
reflecting the high profitability of wholesale trading in China; and the other five&#13;
components generate FRRs between 21 and 24 percent. The overall FRR for the project&#13;
is estimated at 23 percent. Again, these FRRs are relatively robust: a 10 percent increase&#13;
in investment costs, a 10 percent decrease in product prices, and a one-year delay in&#13;
implementation would lower the overall project FRR to 20, 16, and 17 percent,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
5.10  A cashflow projection for CADTIC was also prepared in order evaluate the&#13;
impact of project activities on CADTIC liquidity and solvency. As illustrated in Table 2&#13;
of Annex 5.2, CADTIC is expected to build up a cumulative cash surplus of $42 million&#13;
over 15 years, the repayment period of the IBRD loan to MOF. This includes the cost of&#13;
IBRD debt servicing, all management and administration expenses, and tax payments, but&#13;
excludes the additional revenue accruing from short-term cash management. This level&#13;
of cash generation, equivalent to 28 percent of the IBRD loan, would provide sufficient&#13;
liquidity for substantial write-offs of nonperforming subloans and strong profit&#13;
performance. More than 18 percent of all subloans would have to fail before CADTIC&#13;
encountered any problems with its profitability and debt service capacity-a level of bad&#13;
debt that far exceeds CADTIC's historical performance.&#13;
E. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
5.11  The economic rates of return (ERRs) are based on prices described in paras. 4.29-&#13;
4.30. The economic prices for traded inputs and outputs are based on World Bank price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
projections or border price equivalents. The border price calculations for feed and&#13;
additives, feed crops, feed meal, livestock products, fertilizers, and feed equipment are&#13;
summarized in Table 3 of Annex 5.3. The economic prices for nontraded inputs, such as&#13;
labor, freight and power, are based on a standard conversion factor of 0.97 (this is&#13;
calculated on the basis of an official exchange rate of Y 8.40 to $1.00 and a shadow&#13;
exchange rate of Y 8.70 to $1.00). All economic values were converted to local currency&#13;
at the prevailing exchange rate of Y 8.40 to $1.00. The economic analysis does not&#13;
incorporate any valuation of indirect environmental costs or benefits, which are expected&#13;
to be negligible in the project, as reviewed in paras. 2.47-2.49.&#13;
5.12  The ERRs are generally higher than the corresponding FRRs. This reflects the&#13;
fact that the economic prices for subproject outputs are generally significantly higher than&#13;
the financial prices, while the economic prices for subproject inputs are generally close to&#13;
the financial prices. As summarized in Table 3 of Annex 5.2, the subproject ERRs range&#13;
from 13 to 91 percent, including two subprojects with ERRs between 13 and 19 percent,&#13;
seven with ERRs between 20 and 29 percent, and 17 with ERRs in excess of 30 percent.&#13;
The overall ERR for the project is 40 percent, which is quite robust to wide changes in&#13;
variables: a 10 percent increase in investment costs, a 10 percent decrease in product&#13;
prices, and a one-year delay in implementation would lower the overall project ERR to&#13;
36, 25, and 35 percent, respectively.&#13;
F. RisKs&#13;
5.13   Although some components bear risk associated with the success or failure of a&#13;
particular technology, the project itself faces no unusual risks other than the risks&#13;
associated with investments in agribusiness or agriculture. In fact, since some of the&#13;
subproject outputs will be used for purposes outside agriculture, the general risk&#13;
associated with agriculture is reduced. Detoxification of cottonseed and rapeseed is an&#13;
example. This risk has been minimized by careful evaluation of the project areas'&#13;
markets. The risk of production input supply constraints is minimized by locating the&#13;
subprojects in areas where inputs are readily available. The risk of insufficient demand is&#13;
minimized because of the country's great need for basic inputs for livestock production.&#13;
5.14  CADTIC's capacity as a financial intermediary institution to manage this&#13;
multidisciplinary project, which represents the first Bank operation to employ&#13;
commercialized onlending tailored to an agricultural subsector in China, should not entail&#13;
risks for several reasons. First, CADTIC already has experience in this type of onlending&#13;
through a $50 million ADB-financed project, with a second, similar project under&#13;
negotiation. Second, technical assistance available to CADTIC during its appraisal of the&#13;
initial subproject pipeline has demonstrated its capability to do so well. Third, medium-&#13;
term technical assistance will be provided, under cofinancing agreed to by CIDA, to&#13;
CADTIC to upgrade its accounting system, consolidate its lending operations and&#13;
strengthen its internal control systems, thereby strengthening its loan appraisal capability&#13;
and its risk management. CADTIC has shown a remarkably positive and innovative&#13;
attitude toward commercial onlending to agriculture, to which it has committed its&#13;
institutional capabilities.&#13;

6. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1   At negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Borrower that:&#13;
(a)   the central PMO will maintain its office with terms of reference, staffing and&#13;
other resources acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.4).&#13;
(b)   it would onlend the proceeds of the Loan to CADTIC under a subsidiary&#13;
loan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to IBRD (para. 3.10).&#13;
(c)   (i) a mid-term report on project progress will be prepared by NFIO and&#13;
provided to the Bank before December 31, 1997, from presentations&#13;
prepared by the PMO and subproject sponsors; (ii) thereafter, the report&#13;
would be discussed with the Bank and actions taken to ensure achievement&#13;
of the project's objectives, and (iii) semiannual progress reports will be&#13;
prepared by PMO for submission to IBRD within three months of the end of&#13;
each half year (para. 3.22).&#13;
6.2   At negotiations, assurances were obtained from CADTIC that:&#13;
(a)   CADTIC will not make subloans to any enterprise in which it holds&#13;
majority ownership or exercises a controlling interest (para. 2.8).&#13;
(b)   for subprojects requiring proprietary technology, CADTIC would make&#13;
subloans only after the enterprises make satisfactory arrangements with the&#13;
respective suppliers of equipment and technology (para. 2.12).&#13;
(c)   for subloans to finance commodity markets, operating guidelines consistent&#13;
with market principles acceptable to the Bank would be established prior to&#13;
subloan approval (para. 2.15).&#13;
(d)   it would conduct a review of its lending operations with the purpose of&#13;
improving supervision and control by consolidating its credit operations into&#13;
one department (para. 2.17).&#13;
(e)   it would provide a recapitalization plan to the Bank by not later than&#13;
January 1, 1997 to ensure that CADTIC's risk-weighted capital adequacy&#13;
ratio shall be at least 8 percent by December 31, 1998; and it would maintain&#13;
this ratio from that date onward (para. 2.17).&#13;
(f)   it would undertake a program of institutional strengthening, and that to assist&#13;
it in developing and implementing this program, it would employ&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
consultants with terms of reference, qualifications and experience acceptable&#13;
to the Bank (para. 2.30).&#13;
(g)   it would require subborrowers to maintain consolidated accounts for the&#13;
entire enterprise that would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
IBRD, and submitted to CADTIC within six months of the close of the&#13;
financial vear (para. 2.45).&#13;
(h)   where resettlement and land acquisition are required for a subproject, a&#13;
resettlement plan meeting principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
would be required as a condition of subloan approval by CADTIC, and&#13;
where more than 200 persons are affected, the Bank's prior approval of such&#13;
-lans would be required (para. 2.50).&#13;
(i)   it would employ by July 1, 1997 consultants with terns of reference,&#13;
qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank to assist in carrying out&#13;
its institutional strengthening activities (para. 2.54).&#13;
(j)   it would have its accounts audited annually by an auditor acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, and submit the audit report to the Bank not later than six months after&#13;
the close of each accounting period (para. 3.8).&#13;
(k)   it would make subloans in accordance with agreed onlending terms and&#13;
eligibility requirements as set out in Annex 3.1 (para. 3.13).&#13;
(1)   as a condition of subloan approval by CADTIC, the subproject for which the&#13;
subloan is made would have to be in compliance with Chinese&#13;
environmental laws (para. 3.15).&#13;
6.3    Conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement between MOF and CADTIC (para.&#13;
3. 10) would be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
6.4   Subject to the above, the proposed project would be suitable for a loan of $150&#13;
million to the People's Republic of China. The loan would be for a term of 20 years,&#13;
including a grace period of 5 years, at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US&#13;
dollar single currency loans.&#13;

ANNEX 2.1: SOYBEAN PRODUCTION IN CHINA&#13;
1.    Project Area. Supporting 60 percent of Henan's soybean production, the prefecture&#13;
has been designated a soybean production base and will expand its soybean cropping area&#13;
from the present 133,000 ha to 300,000 ha by 2000. Located in the Yellow River flood&#13;
plain in southeast Henan, Zhoukou supports, with 20 percent intercropping, the cultivation&#13;
of wheat, corn, cotton, peanuts and soybeans. At an average yield of 1.4 t/ha, soybean&#13;
yields are low due to low genetic merit, the absence of Rhizobium root inoculation to&#13;
stimulate nutrient absorption, poor agronomic practices, and lack of irrigation during the&#13;
very hot midsummer season. With the introduction of technical support services, quality&#13;
seed and irrigation, net household income per hectare could increase substantially over&#13;
without-project production. The project area holds seven million people in six counties,&#13;
representing 1.6 million farm households, each cultivating an average of 0.36 ha of land.&#13;
2.    The demand in Zhoukou prefecture for cooking oil is estimated at 94,000 t per year&#13;
with a current production of soybean and other vegetable oils of only 8,000 t. Feed protein&#13;
shortfall in Zhoukou is estimated at 300,000 t/year. The project area supports a heavy&#13;
inventory of pigs and ruminants. There is neither a large-scale soybean oil extraction plant&#13;
in the project area, nor a diversified commercial operation that can satisfy the demand for&#13;
quality soybean products.&#13;
3.    Production. In 1990-92, production of soybeans in China reached 10 to 11 million&#13;
tons. China's soybean production areas encompass the triangle from Sichuan in the south&#13;
to Shanghai and the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang in the east and northeast,&#13;
respectively. Since 1992, a new production phase, characterized by crop substitution rather&#13;
than increased planted area, has resulted in further increases in planted soybeans at the&#13;
expense of com in the northeast, and soybeans over cotton in the North China Plain. As a&#13;
result, soybean production projections in 1995 would increase from to 12.4 to 15.7 million,&#13;
or 0 percent to 25 percent over 1993 production. Presently, soybean production occupies 23&#13;
percent of the national agroindustrial cropping area. The main production regions are the&#13;
northeast (48 percent), the North China Plain (29 percent); the Yangtze Valley (13 percent),&#13;
and south China (4 percent).&#13;
4.    Soybean production between 1950 and 1990 was seriously retarded while efforts&#13;
were under way to achieve grain self-sufficiency. Consequently, the 1990 harvest hardly&#13;
reached the 1950s' levels when China's soybean production area was 80 percent larger.&#13;
The main limiting factors for this production lag have been twofold: (a) the designation of&#13;
soybeans as a secondary grain crop, receiving only limited agricultural support services and&#13;
research, and (b) the low prices set for soybeans during the state price control era, negating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 58 -                      ANNEX 2.1&#13;
production incentives. Whereas the potential for genetic yield improvement remains high,&#13;
most increases have been due to increased planting area rather than genetic improvement.&#13;
In the north, soybean replacement of cotton may be temporary; in the Plains and in the&#13;
south, production increases are expected to be more sustainable. The province of Henan&#13;
represents one of the eight principal soybean-producing provinces, which together produce&#13;
over 50 percent of the national soybean production, with yields within 90-100 percent of the&#13;
national yield. The production of most agroindustrial crops, including soybeans, has been&#13;
designated to counties representing suitable agroclimatic conditions.  In Henan, the&#13;
Zhoukou Prefecture with its six counties, in which the soybean production/processing&#13;
subproject is to be implemented, has long been designated a soybean production base.&#13;
5.    Yield Improvement. The average national soybean yield is 1.4 t/ha, which, based&#13;
on site evaluations, appears to have been overestimated by 15 percent, reducing actual&#13;
averages to 1.2 t/ha. Genetic improvement of soybeans has historically been limited, as&#13;
evidenced by a yield increase between 1957 and 1993 from 0.8 to 1.2 t/ha, well below&#13;
world average. Agroclimatic conditions for optimal soybean production are quite specific&#13;
so that considerable crop adaptation research must be undertaken to achieve optimal yields.&#13;
In addition, soybeans are used for different purposes in different areas; as an oil crop in the&#13;
northeast and a processing crop in the south, and serving as both in the Northern China&#13;
Plain. Furthermore, soybeans in China have been bred to accommodate intensive labor&#13;
such as hand weeding and harvesting, resulting in upright, branching varieties, planted at&#13;
lower density. Emphasis on these traits has reduced the genetic potential for yield&#13;
increases. Each region has its own fungal diseases for which disease-resistance breeding is&#13;
required. Research and development resources for soybeans are limited and highly&#13;
dispersed; soybeans are the only industrial crop for which no central research center has&#13;
been established.&#13;
6.    Efficiency of Inputs. The consumption levels of commercial soybean seed is&#13;
estimated at 20 percent. Compared to wheat seed, less pressure has been exerted by&#13;
extension bureaus to use improved soybean seed and fewer varieties are therefore available.&#13;
Farmers will typically buy commercial seed only if new hybrid varieties are available. As a&#13;
result, farmers often mix seed varieties and seed with nonseed stock, and germination rates&#13;
are subsequently low. Investments in seed production equipment (such as precision drills)&#13;
and in technologies making commercial seed more competitive with farm seed (such as&#13;
seeds coated with pesticides or micronutrients) can be cost effective.&#13;
7.    Labor Inputs.  With increasing costs for agrochemicals and energy as input&#13;
subsidies are diminishing, labor-intensive production techniques retain their value,&#13;
particularly in the North China Plain, where manual labor has been a major contributing&#13;
factor in crop production increases. The absence of thinning of young soybean plants to&#13;
decrease density, and thereby increase yield, is another explanation for low soybean yields.&#13;
8.    Institutional Issues. The effective capacity to improve crop yields has to date&#13;
relied more on coordination by local authorities than on market forces. The establishment&#13;
of production bases requires local governnent coordination to supply production inputs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

extension services and technology packages. The emerging commercial agroindustrial&#13;
enterprises would take over such coordination and the financing of production and&#13;
marketing. Three constraints face such enterprises: (a) the need to maintain a crop rotation&#13;
system to reduce soil depletion and increased crop disease due to soybean monoculture,&#13;
(b) the need to commercialize seed production presently carried out by the state farm&#13;
system, and (c) the need to attract advanced production technology and equipment to render&#13;
production more efficient. Agricultural policy has also been nonconducive to higher&#13;
soybean yields due to the inclusion of soybeans in grain production. Since soybean yields&#13;
tend to compare poorly with that of grain, resources have been concentrated on reaching&#13;
grain quotas to the detriment of soybean development.&#13;

ANNEX 2.2: DOUBLE-ZERO (CANOLA) RAPESEED&#13;
PRODUCTION IN CHINA&#13;
1.    Project Area. Huanggang prefecture in Hubei province is located in one of the&#13;
principal rapeseed growing areas of the central part of the middle-lower Yangtze flood&#13;
plain. Hubei, together with the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui generate 50 percent&#13;
of China's rapeseed production (Annex 2.2). The project area has a farm population of&#13;
839,800 households, each cultivating an average 0.24 ha of land. Double-zero toxin&#13;
rapeseed began to be planted in 1981 and a canola breeding center was established. The&#13;
commercialization of canola has been slow, however, because of a lack of premium seed,&#13;
the lack of differential pricing in areas where little canola was grown, and poor oil&#13;
extraction technology. Pedigree canola seed production centers have been established in&#13;
two of the five counties in Huanggang that are, at present, producing both canola and&#13;
traditional rapeseed varieties. A local oilseed crop research institute is continuing research&#13;
on high-yield and disease-resistant canola varieties. By end-1995, national canola seed&#13;
supplies are expected to be sufficient to supply the three designated canola production bases&#13;
in China at full production.&#13;
2.    Farm-gate prices of certified canola in Huanggang are now substantially higher than&#13;
those for traditional rapeseed. Canola prices in 1994 reached Y 3.2/kg compared to&#13;
Y 2.25/kg for traditional rapeseed, with export prices reaching Y 3.06/kg. This price&#13;
incentive would induce more canola production if rapid field screening tests were available&#13;
at rapeseed collection centers to verify pedigree canola from impure rapeseed. Such tests&#13;
are available elsewhere but are not yet applied in Huanggang. Rapeseed oil is the principal&#13;
vegetable oil consumed in south China and the large cities of Shanghai, Nanjing and Wuhan&#13;
near the project area will require 150,000 t of high-quality canola oil, or nearly double&#13;
Huanggang's present production. The project area contains 2.1 million pigs and 18 million&#13;
poultry, requiring per year 15 million tons of feed and 250,000 t of protein meal. Present&#13;
supplies of rapeseed (including canola) feed cake amount to only 150,000 t, a shortfall of&#13;
100,000 t per year. Price wise, canola meal, at Y 2.2/kg and 39 percent crude protein&#13;
compares favorably as a livestock feed with its main competitor soybean meal, at 44 percent&#13;
crude protein and Y 2.6/kg.&#13;
3.    Production. Rapeseed represents one of China's most common oilseed crops and&#13;
is extensively grown as winter or spring varieties across the country. National rapeseed&#13;
production claims 5.5 million ha, yielding 5.8 million tons of seed, for an average yield of&#13;
1.05 t/ha. The traditional varieties of rapeseed contain two compounds that are toxic when&#13;
ingested by humans or livestock. Following processing, the toxin glucosinolate is confined&#13;
to the cake (following pressurized extraction) or meal (following solvent extraction) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61-                       ANNEX 2.2&#13;
poses a danger when fed to livestock in quantities over 5 percent of formulated feed. The&#13;
toxin erucic acid is oil-soluble and therefore confined to the extracted rapeseed oil, where it&#13;
may affect human health when ingested in large, continuous quantities. Rapeseed oil is the&#13;
cooking oil of choice in southern China, where most is grown. In the north, soybean oil is&#13;
the predominant cooking oil. Because of its toxicity, oilseed meal is been discarded on land&#13;
as a compost, thereby wasting the 36 percent crude-protein nutrients potentially available to&#13;
livestock. The scarcity of protein feeds in China makes rapeseed cake or oil a potential&#13;
large source of high-quality feed.&#13;
4.    Canola Varieties. Double-zero rapeseed varieties, so named as both toxins have&#13;
been largely bred out, were introduced into China in 1981, but met with little acceptance.&#13;
Currently, 270,000 hectares, or 8.2 percent of all cultivated rapeseed area, are under double-&#13;
zero rapeseed. The slow acceptance of double-zero varieties has been due to three factors:&#13;
(a) initially low yields as compared to traditional varieties, (b) nondifferential pricing, and&#13;
(c) poor processing technologies. The low yields have now been improved and were largely&#13;
due to the need for adaptation of newly introduced varieties. Premium pricing has&#13;
improved as processing plants recognize the merit of being able to eliminate the&#13;
detoxification process, and as supplies increase, thereby ensuring more steady supplies to&#13;
processors. Pricing is also dependent on field testing for adulteration at rapeseed collection&#13;
centers, allowing for an on the spot determination of quality, and equitable prices to the&#13;
producer. Poor extraction technologies, by applying too much heat, have reduced the value&#13;
of extracted oil, meal or cake. Increasing shifts from mechanical to solvent extraction will&#13;
improve oil and meal quality.&#13;
5.    Cultivation Policy. In view of the efficiencies to be gained from the replacement of&#13;
traditional with double-zero varieties, GOC needs to implement a policy designed to shift to&#13;
double-zero production. Such a policy is, in fact, in place. GOC has designated three&#13;
double-zero rapeseed cultivation bases of which the project prefecture Huanggang is one.&#13;
Conversion to double-zero production requires an area (such as a prefecture) approach to&#13;
avoid cross-contamination with traditional varieties. The absence of this condition has been&#13;
instnnmental in preventing more rapid conversion. More important is the simultaneous&#13;
improvement of oil extraction, thereby avoiding the denaturization of otherwise good-&#13;
quality rapeseed oil. In those areas where adequate extraction takes place, premium prices&#13;
have been readily paid to producers and suppliers of oil. Further research and development&#13;
should be expanded from the breeding aspect to the economics and marketing of superior&#13;
oil, and the promotion of double-zero rapeseed meal for unlimited inclusion into animal&#13;
feeds.&#13;

ANNEX 2.6: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT MONITORING&#13;
1.    Introduction. Environmental monitoring procedures have been prescribed for each&#13;
of the subprojects. These are designed to ensure that the subprojects meet and continue&#13;
adherence to national standards.  These have been established by the National&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) and are reflected in the individual EIAs for each&#13;
of the subprojects. The monitoring plan also fulfills the requirements of the Bank's OD&#13;
4.01.&#13;
2.    All the subprojects have established a structure for environmental management and&#13;
monitoring within the proposed development. Most of those with existing operations&#13;
already have staff assigned to these activities. The others will establish units before any&#13;
construction activities are undertaken. At each of the subprojects a Vice Director, or staff&#13;
member of equivalent status will be responsible for the overall management of the&#13;
environmental programs. The number of staff to be assigned specific environmental&#13;
responsibilities depends primarily on the size of the subproject. Between two and four staff&#13;
will be required in most of the subprojects. Most subprojects will recruit staff who have&#13;
received training in environmental management and monitoring. Additional specific&#13;
taining will also be provided to the environmental staff of the plants to ensure that they are&#13;
fully conversant with the procedures required.&#13;
3.    The responsibilities of these staff will include: (a) the monitoring of ambient air&#13;
quality; (b) the recording of fuel sources, quantities and quality; (c) the monitoring of&#13;
effluent water stream volumes and quality; (d) the monitoring of downstream impacts of&#13;
released water; (e) the review of solid waste disposal procedures and destinations; (f) the&#13;
monitoring of workplace conditions, including such aspects as dust levels, noise, and gas&#13;
emissions; (g) the review of plant health and safety procedures, including the condition of&#13;
fire equipment and other fire prevention measure; (h) the monitoring of environmental&#13;
protection equipment to ensure that it is maintained in good operating condition; and (i) the&#13;
maintenance of records of baseline environmental parameters including rainfall, wind&#13;
direction and speed, temperature, relative humidity, and other parameters that might be&#13;
required at individual sites. The local environmental protection stations (at county or city&#13;
level) will undertake independent spot inspections to ensure the compliance of the plant.&#13;
They may also be called upon by the plants to assist with the specialized monitoring&#13;
activities, such as stack sampling.&#13;
4.    Reports on the environmental conditions in the plants will be submitted on a&#13;
monthly basis to the appropriate county or city environmental protection bureaus. The&#13;
provincial environmental bureaus will also be appraised quarterly of the environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                      ANNEX 2.6&#13;
conditions associated with the operation of the plants. Summary environmental reports will&#13;
be submitted to the Project Management Office (PMO) on a six-monthly basis for review&#13;
by NFIO and CADTIC. These will document the levels of compliance achieved by the&#13;
plants, describe the situations in which it has not been possible to achieve compliance and&#13;
the measures that are to be taken to ensure that the national standards are adequately met.&#13;
The flow of reporting on environmental matters is shown in Figure 1.&#13;
5.    The indicators to be applied in monitoring the various environmental parameters are&#13;
based on their most easily observed and representative characteristics as well as the relative&#13;
severity of their impacts. The frequency of sampling should be established on the basis of&#13;
the variability of the parameters. Each plant will therefore refine sampling frequencies for&#13;
the major indicators as the project proceeds and they build up a better understanding of the&#13;
operating characteristics. The principal indicators to be applied and sampling frequencies&#13;
are discussed in the following paragraphs.&#13;
6.    Air Emissions. The principal air emission to be monitored are SO2 and particulate&#13;
(fly ash). Permissible levels for these are established on the basis of regulation GB3085-82.&#13;
Most of the subprojects with coal-fired furnaces are required to meet category II standards&#13;
for stack emissions which are:&#13;
S02          1,200 mg/Nm3 (coal with S content &lt;2%)&#13;
1,800 mg/Nm3 (coal with S content &gt;2%)&#13;
Particulate   250 mg/Nm3 (for industrial zones)&#13;
The relevant ambient air quality standards that should be achieved are:&#13;
SO2         0.15 mg/Nm3 (daily average)&#13;
Particulate   0.30 mg/Nm3 (daily average)&#13;
7.    Emission monitoring should be achieved in the first instance by ground-level&#13;
measurement of SO2 and particulate. The most effective manner of achieving this for SO0&#13;
is through the downwind placement of sulfation candles consisting of small, vented&#13;
aluminum boxes containing filter paper impregnated with S02-sensitive lead dioxide.&#13;
Particulate may be measured through the downwind establishment of high-volume&#13;
samplers. Measurements may be taken biweekly or monthly and a total of up to 12 stations&#13;
should be established for each plant. These approaches are cheap to operate, but are&#13;
unspecific and register contamination from all impinging sources in addition to the target&#13;
plant. Provided that the general ambient air quality remais above permitted levels, they&#13;
provide an adequate monitoring approach. If ambient air quality levels fall below&#13;
acceptable levels, it will become necessary for the in-stack monitoring procedures to be&#13;
adopted. These are more complex and costly, but it is likely that the local Environmental&#13;
Monitoring Stations have the equipment and expertise to undertake this type of monitoring&#13;
Emission concentrations in the stack or at ground level will be significantly influenced by&#13;
the levels of S and aluminosilicates in the coal, by the efficiency of the scrubbing&#13;
equipment, by the addition of additives such as lime and by the combustion efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -                      ANNEX 2.6&#13;
8.    Emissions of other toxic gasses are regulated under TJ36-79. The only subprojects&#13;
in which these are an issue are A03 (fluorine) and A04 (ammonia and occasionally&#13;
formaldehyde). Effective removal processes are included in the subproject designs.&#13;
Specific monitoring procedures are not contemplated, but checks of ambient levels will be&#13;
made by environmental staff at regular intervals.&#13;
9.    Solid Wastes. In all subprojects having coal-fired furnaces the volumes and&#13;
destination of clinker and fly ash will be recorded. Complete analysis will be undertaken&#13;
annually to determine the ammonium acetate extractable and water-soluble components of&#13;
these materials. These should include determinations for: Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, K, Mo,&#13;
Mn, Mg, Na, P, S. These analyses are particularly important where these wastes are to be&#13;
used as roadbed material and not covered with an asphalt layer. These ash materials should&#13;
under no circumstances be used as soil additives for agriculture.&#13;
10.   The effectiveness of the gypsum disposal system at Xixi (A03) will be monitored to&#13;
ensure that it does not result in the distribution of this material by the wind and that all&#13;
leachate is collected and disposed of in the treatment system.&#13;
11,   Liquid Effluents. The standards for liquid effluent releases are described under&#13;
regulation GB3838-88. The volumes and quality of all liquid effluents will be recorded on&#13;
a weekly basis. The streams contributing to the major release strean, or contributing to a&#13;
waste treatment facility will be sampled individually. This will be done so as to maintain a&#13;
record of the various waste stream characteristics and provide the basis for recording the&#13;
effects of changes to operational procedures on liquid waste generation. The waste stream&#13;
leaving any treatmtent facility will also be sampled. The analysis of water samples should&#13;
include BOD, COD, pH, C1, Ci, and volatile phenols. Where high heavy metal, oils, or&#13;
organic solvent concentrations are considered likely to occur (D02, D03, D04), specific&#13;
analyses will be included for these compounds.&#13;
12.   Dust. Dust levels in industrial facilities are regulated under GB3095-82. The&#13;
stipulated level for grain dust (&gt;10% free SiO2) is 100 gm/m3. Dust levels around primary&#13;
generation sites such as, delivery bins, grinders and packaging sites will be monitored&#13;
visually, except where provision has been made for dust monitoring equipment to be&#13;
installed. Records will be maintained of the volumes of materials entrapped in the dust bag&#13;
filters in order to ensure the consistency of these systems.&#13;
13.   Health and Safety Procedures. The environmental staff will be responsible for&#13;
ensuring compliance with the regulations governing the use of protective equipment and&#13;
clothing in factory premises. This will include the instruction of supervisory and workshop&#13;
staff and the making of spot checks to ensure that the regulations are being respected. The&#13;
monthly reports will indicate any serious accidents or other health problems that might have&#13;
resulted from the operation of the plants.&#13;
14.   Agricultural Pesticides. A number of toxic organophosphates (WHO/US EPA&#13;
toxicity categories I-II) are being applied on soybean, or as part of the crop sequence that&#13;
includes soybean in Subproject EOI. The management of these will be regulated through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71-                       ANNEX 2.6&#13;
the establishment of a crop protection service in the subproject. Monitoring of impacts on&#13;
groundwater will be the responsibility of the local environmental protection station. No&#13;
specific monitoring measures are in place for E02, because no toxic compounds are being&#13;
used or are contemplated at present.&#13;
15.   Baseline Climatic Conditions. Each plant will maintain a full record of climatic&#13;
conditions. It is not expected, however that they will establish individual climatic stations,&#13;
but rather that they should depend on local climatological services to provide this&#13;
information.&#13;
16.   Appraisal of Replacement Subprojects. Loan approval for such subprojects will&#13;
be conditional to the completion and clearance by EPB and the Bank of the environmental&#13;
assessment and resettlement reports, prepared in accordance to the format use for the&#13;
original subproject pipeline.&#13;
17.   A monitoring schedule is outlined in the attached Figure.&#13;

-79-                       ANNEX 2.10&#13;
ANNEX 2.10: FINANCIAL REPORTING AND AUDITING:'&#13;
GUIDELINES AND TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
1.    Introduction. The guidelines and terms of reference for financial reporting and&#13;
auditing as detailed below will be applied to the China Animal Feed Project. In addition&#13;
to the financial and auditing documentation required, the financial intermediary CADTIC,&#13;
as the financial manager of the project, will refer to the financial covenants pertaining to&#13;
CADTIC as stated in the loan's project agreement.&#13;
2.    As the principal project manager on behalf of the sponsoring Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, the National Feed Industry Office (NFIO) will make reference to any of the&#13;
fmancial and auditing reports referred to above, pertaining to project management,&#13;
training, and other responsibilities related to project implementation. This will also&#13;
include parts of the performance indicators outlined in Annex1r2 of the SAR.&#13;
A. GUIDELINES&#13;
3.    Auditing methods determine how and when financial transactions are recognized,&#13;
calculated, classified, posted, summarized and ultimately reported. Accounting standards&#13;
are formal guidelines that specify how certain types of transactions or events are to be&#13;
recorded and what disclosures should be made in the footnotes to fuiancial statements.&#13;
Acceptable accounting standards, (a) provide for full accountability for all funds by the&#13;
Bank and other lenders, (b) result in adequate financial statement disclosures including a&#13;
clear statement of the accounting policies adopted, (c) ensure fair presentation of financial&#13;
performance and position, and (d) be acceptable to the Bank-approved auditors.&#13;
CADTIC's accounting system should facilitate recording of financial transactions and&#13;
timely financial reporting.  Adequate systems should be in place prior to the&#13;
commencement of project-related expenditures. If CADTIC proposes to use Statements&#13;
of Expenditures (SOEs) as part of the procedure for withdrawing project loan proceeds,&#13;
the Bank will specifically assess its systems and procedures for processing and&#13;
maintaining support documentation for expenditures claimed on the SOEs.&#13;
4.    Financial Reporting. Financial project reports to the Bank should contain a&#13;
signed confirmation of their accuracy and veracity by an authorized representative of the&#13;
borrower. Additionally, the Bank may require audits of the financial reports submitted.&#13;
See also the Bank publication Guidelines on Financial Reporting and Auditing ofProjects Financed by&#13;
the World Bank, July 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-80-                        ANNEX 2.10&#13;
Financial reports are classified into two categories: project-specific financial statements&#13;
and executing agency financial statements. The Bank generally requires annual (and&#13;
sometimes, interim) reporting on the sources and applications of funds in order to&#13;
monitor the use of Bank proceeds. These reports should reflect activity both for the most&#13;
recent reporting period and on a cumulative basis, and generally take the form of&#13;
statements of cash receipts and expenditures. To assist in overcoming cash flow&#13;
problems, a Special Account (SA) can be set up that will be replenished by the Bank&#13;
periodically, based on the appropriate documentation received from the borrower. To&#13;
assist in monitoring the use of an SA the Bank will require periodic statements from&#13;
MOF of Account activity. For executive agency financial statements, the Bank requires&#13;
commercially-prepared annual corporate financial statements, in order to monitor the&#13;
agency's financial position and cost management. Such statements will comprise a&#13;
balance sheet, income statement and cashflow statement.&#13;
5.    Auditing Considerations. Auditors can be classified into three basic types:&#13;
financial statement audits, compliance audits, and operational audits. The basic&#13;
objective of a financial statement audit is to have independent auditors express an&#13;
opinion on the overall fairness of presentation of the financial statements, thereby adding&#13;
credibility to these statements.  Compliance audits encompass review, testing and&#13;
appraisal of controls and operating procedures in an organization. In commercially-&#13;
oriented enterprises these review normnally involve accounting, financial and other&#13;
operations as a service to management. For governmental organizations such reviews&#13;
also cover compliance with regulations, contracts and laws to which these organizations&#13;
are subject. Compliance audits of private and sate-owned enterprises are normally&#13;
performed by internal auditors who are employees of the enterprise. Operational audits&#13;
are more comprehensive examinations of an organization's management, techniques and&#13;
performance. The objective of such audits is to measure the extent to which certain&#13;
objectives are met. The primary report of an operational audit is a report recommending&#13;
improvements to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of operations. Such audits are&#13;
performed by all types of auditors, including internal auditors.&#13;
B. TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR AUDITS&#13;
6.    Auditing Requirements. Audit reports will be submitted by CADTIC to the&#13;
Bank within six months following the fiscal year-end of CADTIC. Audit reports for&#13;
subproject-specific statements, SOEs, and SA statements should be submitted within four&#13;
months of the close of CADTIC's fiscal year. Compliance with the timeliness of&#13;
financial reporting is important. The Bank reserves the right to refer back to the borrower&#13;
the report of any auditor it may consider unresponsive to the agreed objectives or scope&#13;
of the audit.&#13;
7.    The annual audit will contain the following financial reports:&#13;
(a)   Project Financial Statements. Consolidated annual audits for all cash&#13;
receipts and disbursements for the year and on a cumulative basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81-                      ANNEX 2.10&#13;
(b)   Executive Agency Financial Statements. Annual audit reports prepared&#13;
in conformance with internationally accepted accounting standards will be&#13;
required. Such audits will be performed by an independent auditor or&#13;
audit firm, acceptable to the Bank, and will include a balance sheet,&#13;
income statement, statement of changes in financial position, all with&#13;
appropriate footnotes, and a Management Letter.&#13;
(c)   Special Accounts. An annual audit, including tests to establish of use of&#13;
the SA complied with loan legal agreements, may be required upon Bank&#13;
request, if exarnination of the SOEs warrants this audit. This is especially&#13;
important since disbursements from the SA are made by the borrower&#13;
prior to submission of SOEs or withdrawal applications to the Bank.&#13;
(d)   Reports on Internal Control. The Bank will require the borrower to&#13;
request an auditor to prepare a Management Letter or report, outlining&#13;
progress made in achieving the recommendations made by the Bank for&#13;
the strengthening of institutional and operational constraints as described&#13;
in paras. 2.28-2.29 of the Staff Appraisal Report. Where this audit&#13;
addresses irregularities, specific terms of reference for the alleviation of&#13;
same would be included.&#13;
(e)   Financial Covenants.  The audit should verify compliance with all&#13;
financial covenants pertaining to CADTIC, as stated in Schedule 1 of the&#13;
Project Agreement.&#13;
(f)    Performance Indicators. The audit report will contain verification, or&#13;
information to the contrary, on the financial performance indicators set out&#13;
for CADTIC's performance in Annex 3.2 of the Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
C. SUBPROJECT PERFORMANCE&#13;
8.    CADTIC, as a part of its ongoing monitoring of subproject performance, will&#13;
furnish to the Bank by July I of each year for each Investment Enterprise and Investment&#13;
Project financed under this project a copy of its previous annual audit prepared in&#13;
accordance with the Project Agreement. Each said audit report will be accompanied by a&#13;
summary report of CADTIC's evaluation of the subproject's performance which, anong&#13;
other things, will include an evaluation of the subproject's performance and viability&#13;
indicators as contained in Annex 3.2 of the Staff Appraisal Report and a report on the&#13;
subproject's compliance with major loan covenants or other remedial measures imposed&#13;
on the subproject by CADTIC.&#13;
D. PROGREss REPORTS&#13;
9.    Project Progress Report. In addition to the above audit reports, annual progress&#13;
reports will be prepared by NFIO, utilizing its own and CADTIC documentation&#13;
concerning project progress.  The report will include three principal sources of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                      ANNEX 2.10&#13;
information: (a) updated performance indicators, (b) monitoring and evaluation reports,&#13;
and (c) annual and cumulative implementation progress of project disbursement and&#13;
activities. Technical reports and explanatory notes concerning project implementation&#13;
progress will also be attached. During the first two years comprising CADTIC's&#13;
institutional strengthening program, progress reports prepared by CADTIC concerning&#13;
these activities will also be included.&#13;
10.   Report on Statements of Expenditure. The SOEs of all contracts above a value&#13;
of $5 million would be examined by postreview during supervision missions. MOF will,&#13;
as a routine matter, verify 5 percent of all SOEs issued under the Project, and present its&#13;
findings in the form of a report attached to the annual supervision progress report. SOEs&#13;
are required to provide assurances to the propriety and eligibility of expenditures for&#13;
reimbursement under the loan legal agreements. Under the SOE procedure the Bank&#13;
disburses loan funds without prior approval of the supporting documentation. Prior Bank&#13;
approvals will be necessary for disbursements of contracts over the amounts defined in&#13;
the Loan Agreement and include all ICB and NCB contracts of $5 million or more, as&#13;
well as all contracts for proprietary goods, contracts for consulting services in excess of&#13;
$100,000 for firms and $50,000 for consultants. Prior review is also required for the first&#13;
subloans to be approved for each of the seven project components. An audit may be&#13;
necessary at the Bank's request to verify that claimed expenditures were properly&#13;
supported and to confirm the Bank's reliance upon SOEs as a basis for disbursing loan&#13;
proceeds.&#13;
&#13;

Subsector Strengthening Component&#13;
7.    As presently designed, CFIC would serve the feed industry through five activities,&#13;
one of which would be initiated under the project but extended beyond the project's&#13;
lifespan: A 20,000 tpa feed mill with macro- and micromixing capability would prepare&#13;
experimental feeds from ingredient to be animal-tested, and would produce 10,000 tpa of&#13;
surplus feed for commercial sale to offset the CFIC operations budget, thereby generating&#13;
the bulk of CFIC's projected revenues of Y 5 million.&#13;
8.    Four additional activities would be undertaken outside the project, with a financing&#13;
commitment from CIDA:&#13;
(a)   Feed Products Testing Unit. The Unit would evaluate, through biological&#13;
testing using appropriate animal species, the safety, efficacy and feed&#13;
conversion efficiency of new feed additives, feeds, medicaments and growth&#13;
promotants as part of their registration requirements prior to entry into the&#13;
Chinese market. The Unit would comprise feed analysis, microbiological,&#13;
physiological and biochemistry laboratories, and an environmentally&#13;
controlled metabolic laboratory. Five attached animal units would produce&#13;
1,800 pigs, 10,000 broilers and 10,000 layers for testing purposes. The Unit&#13;
would generate revenues from testing trials under contract to the feed&#13;
industry and pharmaceutical firms.&#13;
(b)   Outreach training would be developed in collaboration with provincial&#13;
training institutes and universities, and feed industry representatives.&#13;
Training and skills development would address vocational and technical&#13;
training for feed mill workers and feed laboratory technicians.&#13;
(c)   Feed Subsector Policy Planning.  Five expert committees would be&#13;
established to provide policy and technical guidance to the feed subsector&#13;
and government pertaining to national feed security, national coordination of&#13;
feed additives production, regional feed formulation standardization,&#13;
national feed industry technology development, and feed subsector&#13;
environmental protection. The committees would address priority issues&#13;
pertaining to the above topics, develop and prepare manuals and other&#13;
technical handbooks for distribution to industry and government, and&#13;
provide guidance on technology development and environmental pollution&#13;
mitigation.&#13;
(d)   New Technology Identification and Acquisition. CFIC would collaborate&#13;
closely with NFIO to develop a unit capable of identifying and testing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -                    ANNEX2.11&#13;
domestic and international technologies pertaining to the feed industry.&#13;
Once identified and tested, CFIC would refer innovative and promising&#13;
technology to CADTIC for possible financing with reflow proceeds under&#13;
the project.&#13;
(e)   NFIO Strengthening. The central executive agency, NFIO, would be&#13;
strengthened in project management, financial analysis, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, computer applications, accounting and procurement.  Staff&#13;
training and technical assistance would involve 43 person-months (pmth)&#13;
and 13 pmth, respectively.&#13;

ANNEX 3.1: ONLENDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#13;
THE PROJECT'S FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE CHINA&#13;
AGRIBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TRUST AND INVESTMENT&#13;
CORPORATION&#13;
1.    Introduction. The Government of China and the World Bank have agreed to the&#13;
designation of the China Agriculture Development Trust and Investment Corporation&#13;
(CADTIC) as the financial intermediary for the Animal Feed Project.  A Project&#13;
Management Office within the National Feed Industry Office (NFIO) will provide overall&#13;
coordination and guidance for project implementation.  A  Project Coordination&#13;
Committee will be established under the Chairmanship of the Vice-Minister of&#13;
Agriculture for Science and Technology to oversee project implementation. The purpose&#13;
of the present document is to set out the terms and conditions under which loan proceeds&#13;
would be onlent to eligible beneficiaries.&#13;
2.    Scope of the Terms and Conditions. These onlending terms and conditions&#13;
include the following topics: borrower eligibility; activity eligibility, loan security,&#13;
interest and charges, maturity, and special conditions. Other matters such as CADTIC&#13;
loan processing procedures, procurement and disbursement are addressed separately. The&#13;
following terms and conditions will apply to subloans under this Project, subject to the&#13;
provisions of the Project and Loan Agreements with the Bank.&#13;
3.    Subborrower Eligibility. To be eligible to receive a loan under the Animal Feed&#13;
Project, an applicant must satisfy the following criteria:&#13;
(a)   Will normally have been engaged in the animal feed industry including&#13;
related ingredient supply and service enterprises for at least three years&#13;
prior to application.&#13;
(b)   Be a separate legal entity, whether private enterprise, township and village&#13;
enterprise, or state-owned enterprise.&#13;
(c)   Have prepared an enterprise transformation workplan outlining a time-&#13;
based approach to the establishment of a corporate structure with&#13;
autonomous management, modernized accounting systems, and business&#13;
operations responsive to free market principles. Transformation should&#13;
cover the following criteria:  (i) restructuring toward autonomous&#13;
management; (ii) modernization of accounting systems; and (iii) eventual&#13;
divestment of social obligations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-95-                          ANNEX 3.1&#13;
(d)    Have operated profitably for the three years preceding its application for&#13;
project assistance.&#13;
(e)    Be able to provide not less than 30 percent of total project costs from new&#13;
equity contributions.&#13;
(f)    Be able to demonstrate the ability to provide adequate working capital to&#13;
assure successful implementation of the project.&#13;
4.    In addition, subborrowers should meet the standard eligibility criteria to borrow&#13;
from CADTIC. Specifically, the enterprise:&#13;
(a)    must demonstrate viable financial performance in terms of (i) continuous&#13;
profitability for at least the last three years of operation; (ii) adequate&#13;
solvency to meet current liabilities in a timely manner; and (iii) a debt-&#13;
equity ratio of not more than 3:1.&#13;
(b)    Must possess the management, technical and other capabilities to&#13;
implement the proposed project; and&#13;
(c)    Should not have defaulted on any of its outstanding debt obligations.&#13;
5.    Activity Eligibility. To be eligible to receive a loan under the Animal Feed&#13;
Project, an activity must satisfy the following criteria:&#13;
(a)    Is part of animal feed production, distribution and use, including&#13;
ingredients, and/or essential support services.&#13;
(b)    Addresses one of the following constraints to the development of that&#13;
industry:&#13;
(i)    Alleviates a supply constraint of a critical ingredient;&#13;
(ii)    Makes greater economic use of available raw materials;&#13;
(iii)    Contributes to improvement in the quality or efficiency of&#13;
industrial processes, through improved technology or materials;&#13;
(iv)    Improves the organizational efficiency of the industry through&#13;
specialization and integration.&#13;
(c)    Is capable of demonstrating financial viability, as determined by CADTIC,&#13;
including among other factors:&#13;

(ii)    Debt service cover of not less than 2: 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -                      ANNEX 3.1&#13;
(d)   Must conform to existing environmental, health and safety standards and&#13;
regulations.&#13;
(e)    Where resettlement and land acquisition are required for a subproject, a&#13;
resettlement plan meeting principles and procedures satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank will be prepared as a condition of subloan approval by CADTIC, and&#13;
where more than 200 persons are affected, the Bank's prior approval of&#13;
such plans would be required.&#13;
6.    Loan Security. CADTIC will require collateral for its subloans under this project&#13;
consistent with its practices for similar enterprise and activities outside the Project.&#13;
7.    Foreign Exchange Risk. Subloans may be denominated in foreign exchange, in&#13;
renminbi or in a combination thereof. Foreign exchange risk shall be bome by the&#13;
subborrower in the case of subloans or portions thereof denominated in foreign exchange,&#13;
and by CADTIC for the foreign exchange equivalent of amounts disbursed, in the case of&#13;
subloans or portions thereof denominated in renminbi.&#13;
8.    Interest Rate and Other Charges.  For subloans denominated in foreign&#13;
exchange, the interest rate to be charged to subborrowers under the project shall be the&#13;
rate at which funds are lent to CADTIC plus an operating margin of 2.3 percent,&#13;
consisting of 1.2 percent administrative costs, 0.5 percent loss reserve, 0.5 percent profit&#13;
margin, and a 0.1 percent PMO management fee. For subloans denominated in renminbi,&#13;
the interest rate shall be the prevailing rate for term loans at the time a subloan is&#13;
approved.&#13;
9.    All subprojects will also be charged a project management fee, at the rate of 0.10&#13;
percent of outstanding loan balances, to be used for the operations of the Project&#13;
Management Office. This fee shall be charged and collected at the same time as interest&#13;
charges, but shall be separately recorded in CADTIC's accounts. Use of these funds shall&#13;
be governed by the operating procedures of the PMO to be agreed before Project approval&#13;
by the World Bank, and approved annual work plans.&#13;
10.   Serious efforts will be made to ensure that interest rates to be charged will remain&#13;
generally positive in real terms and that, on the proviso that an operating margin of 2.3&#13;
percent will be ensured, such rates will not be lower than prevailing rates charged for&#13;
similar loans. In addition, CADTIC may levy fees for the following specific services and&#13;
functions in accordance with its established practice.&#13;
11.   Corporate Services. Charges for corporate financial services that CADTIC may&#13;
provide, either on a voluntary basis to interested clients or as part of the special&#13;
conditions required to meet loan approval criteria, shall be charged and recovered&#13;
separately from the foregoing fees. Fees will be set so as to cover the full cost of these&#13;
services when extended to clients under the Animal Feed Project. For other clients, fees&#13;
will be set so as to generate a reasonable margin over costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -                     ANNEX 3.1&#13;
12.   Loan Maturity. Loan maturity shall not exceed seven years, and may include a&#13;
grace period of up to 24 months, during which loan interest will be paid. Within these&#13;
limits, the governing factor in determining the maturity on any specific subloan shall be&#13;
the nature of the project and its projected cash flow as determined by CADTIC.&#13;
13.   Special Conditions. CADTIC may require the borrower to comply with special&#13;
conditions on a subloan to mitigate specific weaknesses in what is otherwise a sound&#13;
investment proposal. Such conditions will normally have the effect of ensuring that&#13;
available resources of the enterprise are preserved for the interest of the project&#13;
investment. They may include, but are not limited to, the following:&#13;
(a)   Limitations on the distribution of earnings;&#13;
(b)   Limitations on expenditures for employee social welfare perquisites;&#13;
(c)   Limitations on the disposition of fixed assets or the acquisition of new&#13;
fixed assets;&#13;
(d)   Conduct of banking services with a designated bank;&#13;
(e)   Limitations on borrowing from other sources;&#13;
(f)    Requirement to maintain management and business policies acceptable to&#13;
CADTIC; and,&#13;
(g)   Requirements to maintain certain financial factors of the borrower's&#13;
business at specified levels, such factors including but not limited to&#13;
working capital and owners' equity.&#13;
14.   Special Provisions for Existing NFIO Pipeline. NFIO, in cooperation with the&#13;
World Bank, has developed a pipeline of projects that satisfy the sector objectives of the&#13;
project, and that appear, generally, to be technically and commercially sound. The&#13;
creditworthiness of sponsors and financial viability of proposed activities has been only&#13;
partially examined, and there is a range of quality among these 30 cases. Under the&#13;
project, priority will be given to completing the evaluation of these subprojects, and&#13;
special arrangements will be made to ensure adequate attention to the potential they&#13;
represent.&#13;
15.   CADTIC recognizes that a significant amount of work has already been&#13;
performed by NFIO and others to identify and evaluate enterprises and projects that may&#13;
be viable candidates for subloans under the Animal Feed Project. Conversely, NFIO&#13;
recognizes that CADTIC cannot approve subloans that do not conform to the criteria&#13;
established for the project or its own financial security. To ensure prompt attention to&#13;
completing the appraisal of these proposals, and to ensure that every opportunity is given&#13;
to sponsors to qualify for participation in the Project, the procedure outlined below will&#13;
be followed. A Joint Task Force will be established by CADTIC and NFIO to undertake&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -                      ANNEX3.1&#13;
a preliminary evaluation of these dossiers. The result of this evaluation should be a&#13;
classification of all applications into one of three groups:&#13;
Group A      Projects which appear to be creditworthy.&#13;
Group B      Projects that may be creditworthy, but which are presently&#13;
deficient in one or more areas.&#13;
Group C      Projects that are grossly deficient in satisfying CADTIC's lending&#13;
criteria, and that are unlikely to correct those deficiencies within a&#13;
reasonable time. Such enterprises may reapply at some later date&#13;
subject to the availability of funds under the project.&#13;
16.   NFIO members of the Task Force will be responsible to:&#13;
(a)    ensure that all documentation prepared to date is readily available to&#13;
CADTIC members;&#13;
(b)   facilitate consultations between all members and the subsponsors;&#13;
(c)    provide background and explanations on technical and sector issues in&#13;
respect of each proposal;&#13;
(d)   assist sponsors to respond to requests from CADTIC;&#13;
(e)    confirm from all potential sponsors that they (i) are prepared to engage in&#13;
corporate commercialization, (ii) have available a sound, technical&#13;
proposal, and (iii) are willing to undertake the necessary environmental&#13;
and resettlement studies, where relevant;&#13;
(f)    draft technical and commercial sections of the preliminary evaluation&#13;
report.&#13;
17.   CADTIC members of the Joint Task Force will be responsible to:&#13;
(a)   review technical and commercial aspects of proposals and request points&#13;
of correction or clarification;&#13;
(b)   examine sponsor creditworthiness, including not only conventional&#13;
financial measures, but giving due weight to local government support and&#13;
other factors that are significant in the Chinese context.&#13;
(c)   identify specific weaknesses in applications that are determined not to be&#13;
ready for immediate processing, and recommend remedial measures,&#13;
where possible, to remove the constraint.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3.2: PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
1.    The major objectives of this project are: (a) to support domestic capacity building&#13;
in the feed industry through predetermined groups of commodity production subprojects;&#13;
(b) supported by an institution promoting feed sector development, in the form of the China&#13;
Feed Industry Center (CFIC), involved in training, feed testing, feed sector policy&#13;
development, technology acquisition and consultancies. The project will be: (c)financially&#13;
intermediated, and (d) participating subproject enterprises will undertake several enterprise&#13;
reform measures to render them more commercially operative. These four objectives, and&#13;
project performance, form the set of criteria on which the project will be monitored and&#13;
evaluated through a set of performance indicators.&#13;
2.    Key  performance  indicators were developed  for:   (a) overall project&#13;
performance, (b) financial intermediation, (c) subproject performance, (d) CFIC&#13;
operations, and (e) enterprise reform. These will be measured at four intervals throughout&#13;
and following the life of the project: (a) year of onset of implementation, (b) mid-term&#13;
review, (c) ICR year, and (d) full-impact year.&#13;
3.    Overall Project and Subproject Performance. Project performance is related to&#13;
total project performance and subproject performance, environmental monitoring, and&#13;
project management.  Indicators for overall project performance include:  project&#13;
disbursement and procurement; subproject activation a's a measure of implementation&#13;
speed, management performance indicators pertain to PMO management quality of the&#13;
project's executive agency NFIO, and of its financial intermediary CADTIC. Key&#13;
environmental monitoring indicators, as detailed in Annex 2.6, would ensure compliance&#13;
with local environmental protection regulations.&#13;
4.    The pipeline of subprojects, as prepared at the time of negotiations, has been&#13;
selected and evaluated in accordance with a set of eligibility criteria. Participating&#13;
enterprises have had to conform to a set of financial eligibility criteria, which will be&#13;
monitored. In addition, general performance indicators for technical and financial&#13;
subproject performance is monitored through indicators addressed incremental outputs,&#13;
profits, incremental workforce increases, and rates of return at completion.&#13;
5.    Financial Intermediation. The financial management ability of the project's&#13;
financial intermediary, CADTIC, will be measured by the following indicators: internal&#13;
reorganization, institutional strengthening through training and TA, meeting preset&#13;
financial viability ratios, and loan collection rates.&#13;
6.    Feed Sector Strengthening. The organization and program implementation of&#13;

ENTERPRISE ASSESSMENT,&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    Introduction. This Annex presents an example of the historical corporate analysis,&#13;
and the determination of the financial and economic rates of return of one of the subprojects&#13;
in the present pipeline. The subproject selected is the Guangdong Huada Machinery&#13;
Works, a state-owned enterprise (Annex 2.7) manufacturing feed processing equipment and&#13;
machine parts. The company's proposal involves the expansion of its factory to produce&#13;
large-capacity feed processing equipment and spare parts.&#13;
2.    The methodology of evaluation and analysis of all subprojects in the present&#13;
pipeline has employed a standard format that has included, in chronological order of&#13;
analysis:&#13;
&#149; Historical, financial and organizational assessment of the sponsoring enterprise&#13;
*  Technical assessment of the proposed subproject&#13;
*  Availability of sufficient corporate equity and counterpartfunds commitments&#13;
* Financial and economical analysis of the proposed subproject&#13;
3.    The above-listed analytic structure has formed the basis for accepting, rejecting or&#13;
modifying proposals brought forward by interested enterprises. Where modifications were&#13;
deemed feasible, recommendations for time-bound further work or remedial action were&#13;
submitted to the enterprises in question. The indicators used in these assessments are&#13;
presented in Annex 3.2, "Onlending Terms and Conditions." The project's financial&#13;
intermediary, CADTIC (see Annex 3.1) has carried out a parallel appraisal of the subproject&#13;
pipeline, using similar criteria as outlined above.&#13;
4.    Assumptions. Most assumptions made in the financial and economic analyses have&#13;
been described in the SAR text: (a) a standard conversion factor of 0.97 was used in&#13;
economic analysis, calculated on the basis of an official exchange rate of Y 8.40 to $1.00&#13;
and a shadow exchange rate of Y 8.70 to $1.00 (paras. 5, 11), and (b) a table outlining the&#13;
calculation of border prices for commonly used project commodities is presented in Annex&#13;
5.3.&#13;
5.    Other Assumptions, as incorporated in the historical enterprise viability, and the&#13;
financial and economic analyses, are outlined below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115 -                      ANNEX 5.2&#13;
6.    Historical Corporate Analysis. The main purpose of the historical analysis was&#13;
the determine the profitability and managerial capability of the potential subproject sponsor.&#13;
To achieve this, a coherent set of financial statements comparable to Western accounting&#13;
standards was constructed, using either available information or data obtained from the&#13;
sponsor. After having been converted into a Western format, the creditworthiness,&#13;
profitability and production efficiency of each sponsor was determined.&#13;
7.    Corporate Income Statement (Table A-2). This analysis is based on supporting&#13;
tables, completed by each sponsoring enterprise, from which an Income Statement and a&#13;
Balance Sheet were constructed. Each subproject sponsor was required to complete Tables&#13;
A-3 through A-8 (see para. 8, Table 1, below). Individually, these tables provided financial&#13;
details concerning the amount and prices of products sold, amount and cost of raw&#13;
materials, labor, factory overhead, marketing expenses, general and administrative&#13;
expenses, financing costs, and extraordinary income and expenses not associated with the&#13;
subproject itself. Based on this data an income statement was derived in accordance with&#13;
Western accounting standards.&#13;
8.    Balance Sheet (Table A-8). Modern Chinese asset and liability accounting now&#13;
follows a format similar to Western standards, which was employed in the determination of&#13;
the balance sheet as subsequent analysis of the sponsor.&#13;
9.    Financial Analysis. Assumptions made for this analysis include the following:&#13;
(a)    Construction Period: For expansion projects, 1 year. For new projects, 2&#13;
years, with certain exceptions.&#13;
(b)   Construction Cost: Cost estimates as supplied by sponsor, and verified by&#13;
consultants. Interest during construction to be capitalized.&#13;
(c)   Revenues: 1995 prices verified. Quantities supplied by sponsor, based in&#13;
annual averages.&#13;
(d)   Direct Costs: Based on estimates of annual averages, or projected from&#13;
similar production lines.&#13;
(e)   Indirect Costs:  Marketing: 1-2.5 percent of sales; and General and&#13;
Administrative: 1-2.5 percent of sales.&#13;
(f)    Financing: For Bank loan: Based on standard variable interest IBRD rate of&#13;
7.25 percent. For counterpart funds: Based on local bank rate. Equity:&#13;
Assuned to be noninterest-bearing contribution.&#13;
(g)   Taxes: Based in local taxation rates and on new (i.e., pioneer) or expansion&#13;
project status.&#13;
(h)   Depreciation: Based on Chinese tax code.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-116-                        ANNEX 5.2&#13;
(i)    Capacity Utilization:  For new projects: 50 percent at end of Year I&#13;
following implementation; 75 percent for Year-end 2; 100 percent for Year-&#13;
end 3. For expansion projects: 75 percent for Year-end 1; 100 percent for&#13;
Year-end 2.&#13;
10.   Economic Analysis.  Constraints encountered in calculating economic prices&#13;
included (a) the large number of diverse subprojects, (b) great variations in end-products&#13;
and raw materials, and (c) the uniqueness in certain areas of a certain end-product or raw&#13;
material. Economic prices were therefore calculated for major classes of representative&#13;
end-products (Annex 5.3), and their coefficients applied to specific end-products most&#13;
closely belonging to similar representative end-product classes. In all calculations, taxes,&#13;
interest and depreciation were added back to income.&#13;
11.   Subproject Categorization. Based on the analyses outlined above, CADTIC has&#13;
categorized the entire pipeline, as it existed at appraisal, into three Groups based on their&#13;
technical and financial viability (Anex 3J.1, para. 19). Further work will be required to&#13;
convert weak proposals into acceptable ones, or to eliminate them for replacement by new&#13;
proposals. The phasing of project implementation is based on the subproject categorization,&#13;
which determines the order in which subprojects accepted for financing will become&#13;
effective.&#13;
12.   Analytic Spreadsheets Presented. One characteristic subproject analysis detailing&#13;
enterprise evaluation, financial and economical analyses is presented in this Annex. The&#13;
remainder is available from the project files. The following spreadsheets were prepared, for&#13;
subproject analysis, with indications of their location:&#13;

SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS OF GUANGDONG HUADA&#13;
MACHINERY WORKS'&#13;
The Subproject&#13;
This subproject would serve to expand its production line to an annual production of&#13;
10 production lines of 2.5 tph; eight units of premix blending equipment; 6,000 pelleting&#13;
dies; 3,000 pelleting rollers; and 74 units of miscellaneous feed processing equipment. The&#13;
investment cost will be Y 105.1 million, with a financial rate of return of 20.2 percent.&#13;
Summary&#13;
Company sales and profits are increasing while repayment capacity is sufficient for&#13;
additional debt.&#13;
Historical Performance&#13;
Sales continued to grow until Year 9 when they reached Y 120.7 million. Gross&#13;
mnargin, at approximately 40 percent (34 percent industry norm) is above industry standards.&#13;
In Year 5, net income was positive and ranged between 24 and 35 percent (4.3 percent) of&#13;
sales.&#13;
Proposed Project Impact&#13;
Project cash flow is projected positive in Year 3 and after Year 4, and the debt-to-&#13;
cash flow ratio is 48 percent, 169 percent and 59 percent during the first three years of debt&#13;
repayment. Thus, the project would not generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt&#13;
repayment in Year 4 when principal payment come due. In terms of sensitivity analysis, the&#13;
project would not be affected strongly by reductions in price or increases in direct costs. A&#13;
10 percent change in either variable would cause the project to continue to be profitable at a&#13;
slightly lower level.&#13;
The project's internal rate of return is based on a 10-year cash flow. The&#13;
construction period is assumed to be two years. Production increases gradually rise as&#13;
construction is completed. Production stabilized at Year 9. Marketing and general&#13;
Figures in brackets indicate industry comparables. Sources include the 1994 RMA Annual Statement&#13;
Studies; Troys; and Standard &amp; Poor Industry Ratios.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

administrative expenses are each assumed to be I percent of sales. Loans terns comprise&#13;
two years' grace when interest is capitalized, one year of interest only, and a five-year&#13;
payback. The proposed IBRD rate is 9.25 percent as compared to a current local rate of&#13;
13.76 percent. Since this project is exempt from income taxes, none have been assumed.&#13;
Analysis&#13;
Sales (real) and operating profits increased 20 percent per year from 1991 to 1994.&#13;
Operating profit margins, at 14.4 percent (4 percent) are three times the industry norm,&#13;
primarily the result of lower operating expenses.&#13;
Slight imbalances are present among the major asset classes of the balance sheet.&#13;
Relative to total assets, current assets are lower and current liabilities are higher than a&#13;
typical firm of the same asset size. As a result, the current ratio, at 1:1.6, is lower than&#13;
expected. However, equity is 38 percent (39.8 percent), which is adequate. Times interest&#13;
ratio is 2.9 (2.7), which is slightly above the norm. This indicates a sufficient cushion exists&#13;
for either interest rate increase or more debt.&#13;
Remedial Action&#13;
No special intervention appears necessary at this time, other than the assurance of&#13;
short-term financing to cover the expected cash flow deficit in Year 4.&#13;

            China - Animal Feed Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objectives of the Animal
            Feed Project are the following: 1) alleviation of supply
            constraints of critical feed ingredients; 2) improvement and
            expansion of the utilization of agroindustrial byproducts
            for use as high-quality livestock feeds; 3) improvement of
            the organizational efficiency of the feed sector through
            specialization and integration; and 4) restructuring of
            project enterprises to effect greater corporate efficiency
            and commercialization.  The project is essentially a
            financial intermediation operation directed toward
            increasing supply constraints and strengthening the feed
            sub-sector infrastructure, and comprises six types of
            domestic feed ingredient or service capacity building
            sub-projects or components and one feed sub-sector
            strengthening component.  The six capacity building
            components include: 1) integrated feed and livestock
            production; 2) feed additives manufacture; 3) feed protein
            crop production; 4) feed processing equipment design and
            manufacture; 5) enhanced-protein feed product synthesis; and
            6) feed commodity wholesale marketing.
