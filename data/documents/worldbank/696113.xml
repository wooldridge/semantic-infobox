waiver.&#13;
Onlending Terms:            The proceeds of the IDA (ITF) Credit would be passed on by the Government&#13;
in foreign currency through the Ministry of Economy--Foreign Aid&#13;
Coordination Center, Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU would&#13;
receive a spread of 0.5% on the amount onlent under the investment financing&#13;
component to the PFIs, to cover its administration costs. The credit would be&#13;
onlent on the following terms: for investment financing; to eligible financial&#13;
institutions including the PIFCA and the domestic banks as a subsidiary loan&#13;
repayable over ten years at a rate of LIBOR plus 2%; for technical assistance;&#13;
to the EDIPA as a grant, and to the PIFCA for institutional support as a loan at&#13;
IDA borrowing cost plus 1.25%. The PIFCA and the domestic banks would&#13;
onlend to subborrower private enterprises at market-determined interest rates&#13;
and margins, with subloan maturities of up to seven years. The subborrowers&#13;
would take the exchange risk and the financial intermediaries would take the&#13;
credit risk. The difference between the cost of the IDA (ITF) credit and the&#13;
interest rate on subsidiary loans under the credit lines, less an administrative fee&#13;
for the PMU, would be retained by the Government.&#13;

Financial/Economic&#13;
Return to Project:           Subprojects financed under the line of credit would earn an expected&#13;
financial rate of return above their cost of borrowing from the PFIs (PIFCA&#13;
and the commercial banks). At current rates and spread to the PFIs this rate&#13;
of return would be at least 15%. Subprojects would assume exchange risk,&#13;
which would generally necessitate competitive production at world prices.&#13;
They would produce mainly tradable goods under relatively low prevailing&#13;
levels of import protection. Economic returns would therefore approximate&#13;
financial returns. The technical assistance to the banks, the PIFCA, the&#13;
capital market and the ESF would be expected to earn a satisfactory economic&#13;
rate of return taking into account likely external benefits associated with&#13;
creating new markets.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND&#13;
Country Background&#13;
1.1.  Armenia is a landlocked country of 3.7 million people bordered by Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran and&#13;
Turkey. It declared its independence formally on September 23, 1991. The Government of President&#13;
Ter-Petrossian, which has been in power since that time, has been able to create a level of continuity&#13;
essential to recovery. With few natural resources, Armenia depends for its economic growth on its&#13;
highly educated population and strong entrepreneurial traditions. While regional political tensions are&#13;
gradually easing, current economic prospects remain constrained by the legacy of Soviet central&#13;
planning. Production has been highly dependent on trade with the rest of the Former Soviet Union&#13;
(FSU) (exports and imports represented over 50% of GDP during the 1980s) and on industry (which&#13;
constituted about 60% of Net Material Product). In the absence of raw materials and primary&#13;
processing facilities, Armenia has had to rely heavily on imports of semi-finished goods and critical&#13;
inputs into domestic industry, particularly of primary energy resources. Armenia was also the location&#13;
of a disproportionate share of the Soviet military-industrial complex. This high degree of integration&#13;
into the FSU economy induced economic collapse in Armenia when the intra-FSU trade, payments and&#13;
financial system broke down. More fundamentally, the elimination of non-market pricing in trade&#13;
between FSU states imposed a severe terms of trade shock on Armenia, particularly due to the sharp rise&#13;
in energy import prices. The lack of comparative advantage of significant parts of Armenia's productive&#13;
base was exposed.&#13;
1.2. Progress on reorienting government in the transition to the market economy has accelerated with&#13;
the improvement in the regional political situation.  There have been several recent positive&#13;
developments in Armenia's relations with its neighbors. The reduction in regional tension has allowed&#13;
the Govermnent to move away from management of a siege economy under an oil embargo, towards the&#13;
implementation of a comprehensive stabilization and structural reform program.&#13;
Recent Economic Developments&#13;
1.3.  The hyperinflation and major fiscal deficit of 1993, resulting from massive net lending to&#13;
enterprises and an inflow of rubles withdrawn from circulation elsewhere in the FSU, have been&#13;
substantially eliminated with the help of currency reform and vigorous measures to bring inflation under&#13;
control. Public expenditure has been limited to priority items and revenue collection increased, while&#13;
interest rates on central bank refinancing of commercial bank credit have been allowed to become&#13;
highly positive in real terms to further restrain monetary growth. Fiscal and monetary restraint was&#13;
enhanced by abolition of the bread subsidy in 1995. The fiscal deficit declined from 48.2% of GDP in&#13;
1993 to 16.4% in 1994, and 8.7% in 1995. For 1996 it is projected to reach 8.2% of GDP. Inflation has&#13;
fallen sharply, to 1.1% per month in October 1996 compared to 46% per month at its peak in 1994, prior&#13;
to the stabilization program. This has been accompanied by broad stability in the nominal exchange rate&#13;
since the Spring of 1994, which has enhanced confidence in the new currency.&#13;

projected at 22.8% in&#13;
1996. This has been accompanied by an accumulation of foreign exchange reserves equivalent to 1.5&#13;
months of imports, twice the 1994 level. The current account deficit and reserve accumulation have&#13;
been financed primarily by IMF and concessional donor resources. Although the direction of change is&#13;
encouraging, it is clear that the level of the current account deficit and the associated exteral financing&#13;
is still unsustainable over the medium term.&#13;
1.5.   Export trends are encouraging. 1995 exports of goods and factor services were 22% above those&#13;
of 1994, (and 1996 exports are projected to be 16.5% above those of 1995). At the same time, export&#13;
data show some diversification into non-traditional markets; 1995 exports to non-FSU countries were&#13;
some 78% higher than in 1994 (from 3 1% of total exports to 46%) while exports to FSU countries fell&#13;
by 7%. Future export growth is expected to come primarily from light industry and services and, to a&#13;
lesser extent, from  agroprocessing.  The export improvement is supported by enterprise survey&#13;
information, as is the recorded export diversification. In addition, foreign direct investment is beginning&#13;
to pick up as privatization accelerates. However, these achievements in GDP growth and external&#13;
adjustment remain fragile. Poverty has become pervasive in Armenia since 1991, particularly in urban&#13;
areas. Recorded unemployment is 5% of the labor force but a further 15 to 30% are estimated to be on&#13;
involuntary unpaid leave or reduced pay for shortened working hours.&#13;
1.6.   The recovery of the Armenian economy will be sustainable only if it is accompanied by&#13;
significant investment in productive capacity, infrastructure, and human resource development that is&#13;
consistent with balance of payments viability and low inflation. From 1996 aggregate investment is&#13;
expected to increase steadily as a percentage of GDP. Foreign private flows, whether through loans or&#13;
direct investment, can be expected to become substantial once the economic recovery is more advanced,&#13;
regional stability secured, and the financial sector more capable of playing an effective role in&#13;
intermediating savings and investment. There are now the first indications of longer term investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
interest from the Armenian Diaspora and other sources which the present project is designed to tap.&#13;
Foreign investment increased from a minute $2.6 million in 1994 to $19.1 million in 1995 and is&#13;
projected to rise in 1996 to $34.0 million, taking a steadily increasing share of overall investment.&#13;
Stabilization and Structural Adjustment&#13;
1.7.  The stabilization program was initiated in 1994, and a Systemic Transformation Facility (STF)&#13;
was approved by the Fund in December 1994, followed in June 1995 by the approval of a Stand-By&#13;
Arrangement (SBA). An Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), approved in February 1996,&#13;
is intended to achieve greater integration of stabilization and structural reform policies over 1996-98.&#13;
The structural reform program was initiated at independence. Prices of most goods and services were&#13;
liberalized in January 1992. The collective farm system was quickly broken up and land was privatized&#13;
to small holders (87% of agricultural land is now privately owned and available for sale). In parallel,&#13;
privatization of small enterprises began: 335 enterprises, mainly shops, had been privatized by mid-&#13;
1992, although the legal basis for this was not yet fully developed. In January 1994, Parliament adopted&#13;
a privatization program, which began to be implemented in the fall of 1994. Subsidies to enterprises&#13;
and directed credit were both curtailed sharply during the year; and a liberal import regime was put in&#13;
place.  A Rehabilitation Credit was approved in February 1995 to support privatization, price&#13;
liberalization and regulatory reform; enhanced financial discipline for enterprises and banks; and the&#13;
social safety net. Implementation during 1995 was strong, with major achievements in the privatization&#13;
of small-scale enterprises and of housing, the elimination of consumer subsidies, and establishment of a&#13;
legal framework to support private sector development. As a result, a Structural Adjustment Credit&#13;
(SAC) was approved by the Board on February 28, 1996. Implementation of structural reforms under&#13;
the SAC has continued to be strong. Major steps have been taken to tighten financial discipline,&#13;
especially in the energy sector. This has been accompanied by accelerated progress in privatization and&#13;
financial sector reform.&#13;
The Project Background&#13;
1.8.   The economic reform program supported by the Bank and Fund has made substantial progress&#13;
in the establishment of a business environment supportive of enterprise, but the successful rehabilitation&#13;
of the economy depends critically on institution building and new investment in productive assets. Up&#13;
to now, the combination of domestic dissaving, macro-instability, and the blockade has effectively&#13;
eliminated investment, other than that financed by humanitarian aid such as for earthquake&#13;
rehabilitation. However, improvement in all the above areas has now started to attract foreign&#13;
investors. In order to provide a catalyst to such investor interest, the proposed project is designed to&#13;
provide assistance to strengthen the enterprise sector, financial institutions, and the client companies of&#13;
the financial sector. Complementing institutional development, long-term financing is expected to be&#13;
made available through the domestic banking system and through a specialized investment company.&#13;
The proposed project will thereby build on the reforms launched under the Rehabilitation Credit and the&#13;
SAC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR&#13;
The Current Situation in the Financial Sector&#13;
2.1.   Structural Change. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Armenian financial&#13;
sector has developed rapidly in terms of number of institutions. Through 1993, a liberal approach to&#13;
new entry with very low minimum capital requirements resulted in the establishment of almost 60 new&#13;
banks, some with significant foreign ownership stakes. Many banks have closed since March 1994,&#13;
partly because of increases in minimum capital requirements, and the number now licensed by the CBA&#13;
is 35, of which one is foreign owned. Fewer banks than at present would be likely to be operating in the&#13;
future Armenian banking system. The new prudential regulations that have been already introduced&#13;
will force at least five of the smallest banks toward mergers or liquidation. According to the CBA, for&#13;
the moment seven "main" banks (excepting Midland-Armenia), including the four former State banks,&#13;
account for 79% of total bank assets; the "medium" banks (twelve) account for 9.6%, and the small&#13;
banks (15) account for 3.8%. The fifth bank which remains from the Soviet period - the Savings Bank -&#13;
is small in asset terms but still accounts for the majority of the branch network. The Midland-Armenia&#13;
bank opened in March 1996. The Midland, because of its superior capital and management practices,&#13;
and clean portfolio, will become an early competitive threat to the longer-established banks. With the&#13;
assistance of EU-TACIS in collaboration with Credit Agricole an Agricultural Cooperative Bank also&#13;
opened in March 1996.&#13;
2.2.  Money and Credit. The positive developments in the sector are still overshadowed by the&#13;
problems of Armenia's fragile economic situation. From 1991 to early 1995, de-monetization of the&#13;
economy occurred as the monetary holdings were either degraded by inflation or reduced as people&#13;
moved savings into foreign currencies and other inflation hedges. This de-monetization was reflected in&#13;
a decline in the broad money supply from over 100% to the equivalent of only 13% of GDP by 1994.&#13;
The deposit component of total money declined from the equivalent of 98% of GDP in 1991 to only 7%&#13;
of GDP by 1994. This decline in the volume of deposit resources available to banks, in tum, led to a&#13;
serious drop in the supply of credit relative to real economic activity. Total bank credit outstanding fell&#13;
from 67% of GDP in 1991 to less than 10% of GDP by 1993. Because of high inflation the limited&#13;
credit available was lent on very short maturities - typically one to three months. The situation&#13;
regarding the deposit and credit aggregates is shown in Figure 1.&#13;
2.3.  Interest Rates. Interest rates (in dollars and Drans) moved strongly into positive territory&#13;
during 1994 as a result of liberalization and monetary restraint. As the stabilization program has taken&#13;
hold, nominal interest rates on both bank loans and bank deposits have since fallen significantly with the&#13;
decline of inflation through 1995 and 1996. The 6-month dram lending rate declined from 24% per&#13;
month in October 1994, to 6-9% during the early part of 1996. Dollar lending rates for 6-month loans&#13;
declined from about 8% to 3% per month during the same period. This decline has been associated with&#13;
a narrowing of bank margins when liquidity has been tight, with margins on 6-month business declining&#13;
steadily over 1995-96.&#13;

2.4.     Because there is presently almost no lending in Armenia for maturities of more than six&#13;
months, the rates shown in Table 2 provide only limited guidance about the rates at which banks would&#13;
on-lend the funds available from the credit line. Short term rates are high and reflect specific market&#13;
conditions including monetary restraint, and uncertainty about inflation. The banks will need to lend at&#13;
well below the current short-term rates if they are to find viable projects and clients for the longer&#13;
maturity loans. Fortunately, the evidence from recent months is that the banks are beginning to adapt to&#13;
an environment of lower rates and margins.&#13;
2.5.     Bank Regulation and Supervision. The CBA  has over the past three years made substantial&#13;
progress in developing a sound system of regulation and supervision for the banks, governed by a CBA&#13;
resolution of April 1995. Regulations have set minimum statutory capital levels, equity ratios, liquidity&#13;
ratios, required reserves in the CBA, and loan exposure limits to single borrowers. Banks are also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
required to provision fully on all new loans and to phase in provisions on old loans over a two year&#13;
period. It is estimated that by the end of 1996 more than half of all doubtful loans will have been&#13;
provisioned. Loans are classified according to international standards, on the basis of their delinquency&#13;
status, number of extensions, and collateral. A provisioning range in most cases allows discretion in&#13;
recognizing risk.&#13;
2.6.   Supervision of the banks is the responsibility of the departnent of bank supervision, regulation&#13;
and licensing in the CBA. The department is also responsible for supervising other banking transactions&#13;
such as the foreign exchange activities of nonbanking institutions.  Licensing and Supervision&#13;
departments have been combined, allowing information sharing between on-site and off-site&#13;
supervision, and substantial progress has taken place on supervision programs, with the assistance of the&#13;
IMF.&#13;
2.7.   Until recently, banking law was inadequate in its definition of the powers of supervisors,&#13;
sanctions and enforcement measures and the handling of failed banks. However, a new Banking Law&#13;
which addresses these problems was passed by Parliament on June 30, 1996. Together with the parallel&#13;
legal arrangements contained in the new law on the Central Bank itself and the new Law on Bank&#13;
Insolvency, the authorities are now in a much stronger position to exert regulatory authority over the&#13;
banking system.&#13;
2.8.   Bank Financial Performance. A serious development has been the deterioration in the quality&#13;
of bank loan portfolios reflecting the decline in output and the increasing reliance of many enterprises&#13;
on distress borrowing. This rise in non-performing loans and the associated decapitalization of major&#13;
banks has been part of the cost of keeping financially distressed State-owned enterprises alive. The&#13;
1996 situation, following a portfolio review exercise, is summarized in Table 3.&#13;
Table 3: Bank Reserves and Non-Performing Loans, 1996 (Dram million)&#13;

2.9.   Table 3 shows that the shortfall of reserves ($12 million) was in July 1996 equal to just over&#13;
twice the actual reserves of the banks. This problem has been exacerbated by the high real interest rates&#13;
which have applied in the period since 1994 as the authorities have fought a successful battle against&#13;
inflation. The former State banks (Table 3) faced particular difficulties and were technically insolvent,&#13;
although Armimpexbank has better prospects because of an expected capital injection.&#13;
2.10.  The capital of the newly established banks is very small. In 1996 the largest amount of total&#13;
capital in any one bank outside the group of former state banks (with the exception of Midland-&#13;
Armenia) was about US$400,000, with most of the smaller banks having capital below US$200,000&#13;
even before loss provisions required by IAS. Adjustment for loan losses without additional capital&#13;
would eliminate a number of the poorer banks and, with the increase in statutory capital required as of&#13;
January 1997, a number of mergers are likely.&#13;
2.11.  In short, during the first half of the 1990s, the banking system was marginalized as a source of&#13;
finance to real economic activity. Its marginalization is reflected most obviously in the increased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
importance of non-bank financing (e.g. through inter-enterprise arrears). The sector as it now exists is&#13;
generally poorly equipped to support the recovery of the real economy and so represents a constraint on&#13;
that recovery. However, despite the generally adverse picture, some of the new banks have greater&#13;
potential to develop enterprise financing capacity. A group of Western bank examiners carried out a&#13;
portfolio audit of approximately 30 banks, as part of project preparation, to determine the extent of non-&#13;
performing loans, the legal obstacles to enforcement of collateral claims, and the improvements needed.&#13;
The banks were analyzed on the CAMEL (Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Managerial Assessment,&#13;
Earnings Analysis, and Liquidity Analysis) system and were rated on a scale of I (worst) to 5 (best).&#13;
Seven banks had ratings close to or above 4.01. These banks (excluding the Midland Armenia) had&#13;
total capital ranging from $150,000 to US$300,000 million equivalent, and total assets ranging from&#13;
$300,000 to $500,000 equivalent. On capital adequacy criteria alone, ratings of 4 to 5 were deemed&#13;
indicators of solvency in the banks, and on this assumption, there were 15 banks qualified. The small&#13;
current size of these banks (with the exception of Midland-Armenia) however would limit access to a&#13;
credit line.&#13;
The Role of the Proposed Project in Financial Sector Institution-Building and Reform&#13;
2.12.  The challenge for banking reform programn is to establish a small group of stronger banks able&#13;
both to mobilize savings and provide investment and other credits and financial services to local&#13;
enterprises in the post-privatization era.  The guiding principle of this reform strategy is that it should&#13;
strengthen the best banks while those with little or no potential should be closed, merged or&#13;
substantially restructured. Continuing regulatory reforms are also needed, especially in on-site bank&#13;
supervision, although, as stated, considerable progress has been made. This will create pressure for&#13;
better quality banking from above through the CBA, while individual banks are encouraged, inter alia&#13;
through the proposed operation, to strengthen their own performance. On the basis of the audits it is&#13;
expected that, in a number of banks, financial performance is adequate, and that capital positions and&#13;
banking capacity would be strengthened further. This would take place with the help of a pilot loan&#13;
work-out program under way for two of the larger banks under the SAC TA operation, and with&#13;
broader institution building support under the proposed project, channeled through a banking advisory&#13;
unit.&#13;
2.13.  This operation would include a credit line which would provide an incentive to banks to&#13;
upgrade their operations, while the accreditation conditions would ensure that banks that qualify will&#13;
have the ability to make relatively sound credit decisions. Banks which have received positive audit&#13;
reports will have access to early support from the technical assistance component of the project to&#13;
achieve accreditation. The incentive of future access to the credit line should encourage other local&#13;
banks to take advantage of the technical assistance support, which has been designed to provide both&#13;
necessary up-front diagnostics and sustained support to banks through the proposed banking advisory&#13;
unit. The results of the portfolio audits and other inspection visits suggest that early accreditation could&#13;
be achieved by at least two commercial banks. Apart from support to the banks, the project would also&#13;
strengthen the financial sector through capacity building and provision of a line of credit through an&#13;
investment corporation (the PIFCA) designed to mobilize foreign investment for small to medium scale&#13;
private enterprises.&#13;
The Capital Market&#13;
2.14.  Market Architecture. The capital market in Armenia is at present in an early stage of&#13;
development. It consists primarily of commercial banks and two stock and currency exchanges at&#13;
I      The better banks were Midland Armenia, Gladzor, Prometheus, Echo, Metz, Converse and Lend.&#13;
2      The Banking Sector Policy Note (October 1995) proposed a strategy which was agreed with the&#13;
Government, it is in the process of being implemented, with Bank support including this present project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Yerevan and Gyumri, which deal mostly in foreign currency spot (and futures) contracts and short term&#13;
government securities. Both Yerevan Stock Exchange (YSE) and Gyumri Stock Exchange (GSE) are&#13;
Self Regulating Organizations, and have their own internal regulations and listing requirements. In&#13;
addition, there is a Yerevan Commodities exchange ("Adamand"). There are approximately 40&#13;
stockbrokers employed at the banks, about 17 individual broker seats at the YSE, and another 10-15&#13;
licensed brokerage companies. In addition, an investment fund has also been formed, managed by a&#13;
licensed management firm.&#13;
2.15.  The capital market is largely concerned at this stage with providing the infrastructure for the&#13;
trading of privatization vouchers. A centralized share registry has been established and regulations were&#13;
passed in April 1996. Companies are not, however, obliged to register centrally and few have so far,&#13;
creating a potentially disorderly situation. There is no provision as yet for clearing and settlement, nor&#13;
arrangements for linking a depository with registration. Regulation and licensing of privately owned&#13;
share depositories is also expected to take place in 1996. Although the three stock and commodity&#13;
exchanges are currently authorized to operate, only three companies (other than YSE's own shares)&#13;
have yet been listed.&#13;
2.16.  Once the share registry and depository are established, the next major requirement is the&#13;
provision of regulations regarding market transactions. Though the stock exchanges have tried to set up&#13;
temporary regulations for their members, these are not comprehensive and lack the force of law. A&#13;
securities market supervision unit in the MOF (the SMS) presently licenses only brokerage firms, while&#13;
individual brokers and managers of investment funds are licensed by a separate autonomous agency&#13;
which, however, has no secretariat and no other regulatory responsibilities. There is a need for a single&#13;
securities regulatory body with adequate resources, authority and responsibility to develop and&#13;
administer the securities regulations in the country effectively. The commissioners should be drawn&#13;
from state agencies (e.g. CBA), the stock exchanges, and other private intermediaries.&#13;
2.17.  Trading and Transactions. The major impetus in secondary trading in equities is expected to&#13;
come from the privatization process, whereby a number of private individuals now own shares in about&#13;
800 medium to large companies. Shares are increasingly in private hands, but the market is constrained,&#13;
inter alia, by lack of information sources to facilitate trading. As a result, secondary trading will only&#13;
emerge slowly. The only primary trading outside the mass privatization program up to now has been&#13;
the public offer of shares in three banks. There is at present no trading in corporate loan or equity&#13;
securities, and bonds are confined to Government issues. The CBA has been the primary dealer for&#13;
these bonds and only banks could directly purchase them. The first Treasury bill auction took place in&#13;
September 1995.&#13;
2.18.  Commercial banks currently do not require special licenses to operate in the securities market,&#13;
and are mainly regulated by the CBA. They are not allowed to borrow to purchase securities but can act&#13;
as intermediaries or invest profits. However, they are active in trading in privatization vouchers, and,&#13;
given the weak state of their balance sheets, there is a need for control over these trading activities.&#13;
Trade in vouchers is supposed to take place through special investment funds (IFs). However, only one&#13;
IF has so far been established, for reasons mentioned below.&#13;
2.19.  The lack of trading information is compounded by lack of requirements for financial disclosure,&#13;
and by accounting information which is based on the late Soviet model. This is exacerbated by the non-&#13;
market-based initial valuations of companies in the privatization program. This information problem&#13;
affects the secondary market and also initial lenders who will find difficulty in evaluating existing&#13;
companies. Given that the traditional management has retained control of many companies, it is also&#13;
important for outside shareholders to have access to company information through appropriate&#13;
shareholder rights regulations. These issues have been addressed in a revised companies law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
2.20.  Regulatory infrastructure. A law on circulation of securities was approved in 1993, and the&#13;
SMS was created in 1995, with responsibility for regulation of brokers, dealers, depositories, IFs, and&#13;
financial consultants. The Government has issued regulations on the share registry and the IFs. As&#13;
mentioned, there is a need to reconstitute the present SMS into an autonomous commission with a&#13;
clearly defined regulatory mandate, and the authority to enforce market regulations. Besides the&#13;
regulatory framework to govern the role and responsibility of this Commission, further regulations need&#13;
to be drafted governing the securities transactions, financial disclosures, shareholder rights, accounting&#13;
and auditing standards, and documentation required at various stages of transactions. The Law on&#13;
Circulation of Securities and the regulations for the securities industry would therefore need to be&#13;
amended.&#13;
2.21.  A decree on investment funds was adopted in September, 1994, and recently revised and&#13;
presented to the Government for final approval. IFs must be closed-end, using vouchers or cash. A&#13;
management company and a depository for IFs have been licensed and a draft of accounting standards&#13;
for IFs has been prepared. Problems have arisen over the value of vouchers entered into the IF accounts&#13;
and their tax implications, and amendments to the licensing regulations are needed to address these&#13;
issues. The Regulations regarding licensing and operating procedures governing the operations of Share&#13;
Depositories are under preparation currently and would be submitted to parliament at the end of 1996.&#13;
2.22.  The MOF is currently preparing a Non-Bank Financial Institutions Law (NBFI) to regulate all&#13;
non bank financial and capital market institutions. This law would define the types of such institutions,&#13;
their role, prudential requirements and responsibilities. The institutions covered under this law would&#13;
include insurance companies, trust companies, investment funds, investment companies, securities&#13;
brokerage companies, and other non bank financial institutions. Supplementary regulations governing&#13;
their activities will need to be developed for each of the above categories of institutions.&#13;
The Role of the Proposed Project in Capital Market Reform&#13;
2.23.  The project aims to follow up on the SAC TA project, with a limited program of initiatives in&#13;
institution and capacity-building. The SAC supported the establishment of a central share registry, and&#13;
a depository is to be implemented during 1996. Following the set up of these basic facilities, it is&#13;
proposed, under the project, to provide the appropriate consultancy and training technical assistance to&#13;
the SMS, the stock exchange and other securities market professionals, in order to facilitate: (i) the&#13;
drafting of appropriate regulations, terms of reference, a charter and to provide equipment for a&#13;
reconstituted securities regulatory body, (ii) training of the proposed group of initial commissioners, (iii)&#13;
drafting and upgrading of broader securities market regulations, including those on investment funds,&#13;
(iv) training of a key group of senior securities market principals, and, (v) development of more&#13;
widespread training programs for a larger securities market audience. In addition (vi) the project&#13;
includes a small provision for setting up a public information program to educate the public on areas&#13;
such as share ownership. While not part of this project, accounting reform is a key requirement for the&#13;
development of IAS standards of disclosure in the banks, capital market institutions, and enterprises. A&#13;
long-term program to convert accounts, and to establish a framework of regulations and laws has been&#13;
initiated by USAID.&#13;
&#13;

III. PRIVATIZATION AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
State Enterprise Privatization&#13;
3.1.   The enterprise sector in 1992 consisted of some 2,000 enterprises at the medium-large scale and&#13;
some 5,000 at the small scale level, largely in trading. The privatization program adopted in January&#13;
1994 envisaged that privatization of State enterprises would take three years, with one third of state-&#13;
owned productive assets being privatized each year, although this has proved to be overambitious, and&#13;
the program is not likely to be completed before 1998. All enterprises, barring certain public utilities,&#13;
are slated for privatization. This is seen by the Government as essential to reducing the pressure for&#13;
subsidies, and is a key factor in the growth of the private sector. Privatization of small-scale enterprises&#13;
is well underway - by September 1996, a total of 4108 small enterprises (80%) were privatized, and all&#13;
remaining small-scale enterprises are planned to be privatized in 1996. Privatization of medium- to&#13;
large-scale enterprises is also well underway, through the mass privatization program, with 800 (40%)&#13;
offered for sale by September 1996. A cumulative target range of 1,200 to 1,500 (60 to 75%) was&#13;
planned to be offered for sale by the end of 1996. About 600 construction sites are also planned to be&#13;
sold in 1996. The rate of progress so far is below that required to meet the ambitious targets for&#13;
medium to large scale enterprise privatization in 1996, but the rate of transactions has accelerated&#13;
recently and the overall achievement may be regarded as impressive.&#13;
3.2.   Most privatizations have taken place through public subscriptions in which cash or vouchers&#13;
can be used, and in which the Government offers all of the shares which it currently owns. 64% of&#13;
those shares are offered to the public by subscription and 20% given free to the employees, who also get&#13;
a preferential price on a further 16% if they wish to purchase. The minimum subscription to validate a&#13;
sale is for 25% of shares, and all but 35 out of the 800 enterprises have met or exceeded this level. In&#13;
addition, certain enterprises will be sold by tender or by closed subscription to employees (primarily&#13;
ones that are currently leased to the employees), or by auction of packages of shares. In addition,&#13;
twelve enterprises have been selected for sale by tender to strategic investors through the services of an&#13;
investment bank.&#13;
3.3.   The Privatization Law of 1992 has been refined to include: a time limit for initiation of&#13;
liquidation proceedings if an enterprise has failed to be sold in the auction process; Government&#13;
discretion in the method used in complex privatizations, and; provision to allow enterprises to be sold to&#13;
strategic investors for cash (i.e. to exclude the use of vouchers). This latter amendment is viewed by the&#13;
Government as essential to the promotion of the role of foreign investors in the privatization process.&#13;
To accelerate enterprise restructuring, a program of turnaround, or liquidation and bankruptcy, was also&#13;
initiated under the SAC for eleven key financially distressed enterprises. This program was meant to&#13;
relieve the Government of a significant fiscal or quasi-fiscal burden, and to provide a model for action&#13;
by creditors and by the judicial system. The process will be assisted in the future by a revised&#13;
bankruptcy law, allowing for company reorganizations and a clearer judicial process.&#13;
3.4.   Table 4 shows the rate of progress of the privatization program from 1994 as it affected&#13;
enterprises initially under the control of the Ministry of Industry. 20% privatization represented the first&#13;
stage of assigning shares to the enterprise workers. By 1996, the privatization of state enterprises has&#13;
begun in 601 (79%) of the total number of enterprises under the Ministry of Industry, of which 187&#13;
(24%) have been fully privatized through the Mass Privatization Program. Light industry in particular&#13;
have been largely privatized.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
3.7.   A number of surveys have identified the principal constraints facing private business. Power&#13;
shortages, lack of finance and reduced domestic demand figured as the most important perceived&#13;
constraints in studies carried out in 1992 and 1994. Exchange rate instability was also cited as a&#13;
problem, but this would no longer apply as of 1995. In the case of a survey of 30 private and privatized&#13;
firms, at varying scales of production, carried out for this project, covering manufacturing and services,&#13;
the principal problems were identified as shortage of working capital and term finance, and inadequate&#13;
financial management. The privatized firms were in poorer condition than those that had started out as&#13;
private, with weaker capitalization and poorer planning capacity, especially the planning of investment.&#13;
Monthly reports where they exist were production reports and financial and market forecasting was not&#13;
regarded by management as a critical concern. However, unlike enterprises in some other FSU&#13;
economies, enterprises were not producing regardless of market demand, since final goods inventory&#13;
rarely exceeded two weeks. Lack of term finance was evident in liquidity problems and in the age of&#13;
plant, which in 80% of firms averaged 15 years or more. At the same time, capacity was frequently&#13;
well in excess of domestic market needs, with utilization ranging from 10% in older (privatized) firms,&#13;
and 25-40% in smaller private companies.&#13;
3.8.   The study cited an onerous tax system facing enterprises, which includes taxes on profits at&#13;
30%, value-added at 20%, excess wages at 30% (but only applicable to state enterprises), social security&#13;
(payroll) at 37%, and assets at 0.2% on building structures. Apart from the bias against employment,&#13;
the principal problem was the application of taxes. Firstly, according to the study, there appear to be&#13;
misunderstandings in how taxes are calculated, implying lack of sufficient inspectors, and resultant&#13;
inequity in application. In addition, the requirement for advance payment of profits taxes on a quarterly&#13;
basis with no allowance for loss carry forward creates cash problems for companies, and may result in&#13;
inflated tax payments. Also, the inability to take deductions for a number of expenses such as research&#13;
and development, marketing, training, and interest payments on long term loans (over I year), results in&#13;
inflated estimates of taxable profits. The reform of enterprise taxation needs a comprehensive analysis&#13;
(to be undertaken through an upcoming Private Sector Development study).&#13;
Export Potential&#13;
3.9.   Given  the collapse in domestic and FSU market demand, rapid export growth, especially&#13;
outside the FSU, is central to Armenia's development strategy. Exports are projected to increase from&#13;
21% of GDP over the next five years. At present, 70% of Armenia's exports are to FSU countries,&#13;
mainly to Russia and Turkmenistan, and the main exports are mineral products, metal products, and&#13;
jewelry. Armenian firms need to diversify into non-FSU exports through improving competitiveness to&#13;
meet world standards. At present, most Armenian firms cannot meet the price, quality, and delivery&#13;
requirements of overseas buyers in industrialized markets. Even in the traditional FSU markets,&#13;
increased competition threatens to erode existing market share.&#13;
3.10.  Armenian enterprises possess strong competencies in areas such as engineering. Many existing&#13;
firms possess sophisticated equipment (much of which is underutilized). The work-force is well-&#13;
educated. A network of private traders, currently engaged in import trade, is emerging. This will&#13;
improve delivery of raw materials and finished goods, and probably strengthen trade finance to&#13;
exporters. The infrastructure for quality assurance is also good. Under the Department of Standards, a&#13;
skilled group of engineers manage reasonably well-equipped testing laboratories.  However, the&#13;
orientation would have to change from FSU standards to international standards, such as the ISO 9000&#13;
series. The legacy of central planning has left most firms ill-equipped to deal with the requirements of&#13;
foreign buyers and compete with exporters from other countries. Firms have little experience in&#13;
marketing, market research, product costing and pricing, merchandising, and delivery. Finally, as&#13;
stated, most firms are desperately short of cash, making production planning and marketing difficult,&#13;
and damaging the credibility of Armenian firms as reliable suppliers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
3.11.  Despite the adverse situation mentioned above, a 1996 survey4 of Armenian firms suggests that&#13;
some are beginning to take steps to address these deficiencies. They are attempting to diversify&#13;
markets, improve product quality, modify production lines and initiate contacts with new buyers outside&#13;
the FSU region. For example, a manufacturer of electric motors has entered into a joint venture with a&#13;
Chinese firm to make floor-mounted electric fans; a software firm has established contacts with Western&#13;
firms to design and manufacture multi-media software programs.&#13;
3.12.  Exports will be assisted because the Government's commitment to a low level of protection for&#13;
domestic industry will insure that domestic costs will not be inflated vis-a-vis world prices. The new&#13;
import tariff introduced in 1996 incorporates only two rates: zero and 10%. The Government is&#13;
committed to early accession to the World Trade organization and intends to bind its tariff at 15%.&#13;
Nevertheless the common denominator among surveyed companies remains lack of experience and&#13;
exposure to the international marketplace. Export services remain very rudimentary. Firms do not&#13;
know where to obtain the right expertise and they cannot afford to hire foreign expertise. Limited&#13;
financial resources also constrain them from undertaking business promotion travel, product launch,&#13;
advertising, product adaptation, and staff training activities.&#13;
The Role of the Proposed Project in Enterprise Development&#13;
3.13.  The easing of the financing constraint on enterprises is a principal concern of the proposed&#13;
project, and is addressed through a line of credit to the PIFCA and domestic banks. To facilitate access&#13;
to the line of credit and assist businesses in general, the project would also finance business advisory&#13;
capacity. In addition, to assist technological upgrading, and to enhance competitiveness and&#13;
diversification of Armenian firms into exports, the proposed project would support a number of&#13;
additional areas of assistance: an enterprise support fund to create "matchmaking" contacts between&#13;
Armenian and foreign companies, in order to set up investment, technology and trade deals, and to&#13;
develop the export capacity of competitive Armenian; a business advisory service, and; assistance to&#13;
develop the securities market and secondary share trading, thereby facilitating raising of finance by&#13;
enterprises. Finally, a program to convert bank and enterprise accounts to IAS standards is underway&#13;
through USAID.&#13;
The Enterprise Legal Framework&#13;
3.14.  Considerable progress has been made on the development of the corporate legal framework,&#13;
including laws on banking, lending security, and companies.&#13;
3.15.  Company law. An enterprise law was passed in 1992, followed by laws on sole proprietors&#13;
(1993), enterprise registration (1993), and bankruptcy and insolvency (1995). The enterprise law&#13;
covered different types of business organizations, including sole proprietorships, cooperatives, joint&#13;
stock companies, limited liability partnerships, state enterprises and non-profit organizations. The law&#13;
encompassed a broad range of issues but was general and was superseded by a new Law on Joint Stock&#13;
Companies adopted in March 1996. The new law provides more detailed regulations referring to&#13;
subscription of share capital, disposition of shares, share buybacks, shareholders' rights, duties and&#13;
liabilities. Provisions relating to the corporate governance structure form an important part of the law,&#13;
defining the structure and composition of the governing bodies, division of responsibilities between the&#13;
shareholders' meeting and board of directors, duties and liabilities of the directors and conflict of interest&#13;
issue. The law also contains reporting requirements for joint stock companies, including publishing&#13;
their annual reports on financial and economic activities, balances and information on profit distribution.&#13;
4      The 1996 survey confirmed the results of a 1995 survey, carried out in preparation for the SAC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
3.16.  Bankruptcy Law. In order to promote the process of enterprise restructuring, a bankruptcy&#13;
law  was adopted by parliament in June 1995.  However, it did not adequately provide for&#13;
reorganizations, nor the location of judicial authority to administer the law sufficiently clear.&#13;
Furthermore, claims provisions (e.g. for shareholders) needed clarification. Amendments to the existing&#13;
bankruptcy law were approved in November 1996. Even if the legislative framework for bankruptcy is&#13;
improved, however, the judiciary has little experience in commercial law, and the necessary institution&#13;
building to implement the law will take some time. Moreover, after a long history of state control,&#13;
creditors may be reluctant to initiate proceedings under the bankruptcy law without a clear signal from&#13;
Government that bankruptcies are acceptable. There is, therefore, an education task both in the&#13;
Government and in the judiciary.&#13;
3.17.  Laws on Banking and investment funds. Initial legislation consisted of the Law on Banks&#13;
and Banking Activity (1993), the Central Bank (1993), Investment Funds (1994), Registration and&#13;
Licensing of Banks (1995) and numerous regulations issued by the Government and the Central Bank&#13;
pertaining to various aspects of banking activities. The initial banking laws were inadequate in the&#13;
definition of the powers of supervisors, sanctions and enforcement measures and the handling of failed&#13;
banks, connected lending and many other matters. To address these deficiencies, revised laws&#13;
governing the Central Bank and commercial banks were adopted, along with a Law on Bank&#13;
Insolvency, in 1996, as conditions of the IMF ESAF and the Bank's Structural Adjustment Credit. A&#13;
Law on Non-Bank Financial Institutions, which will cover a broad range of financial institutions&#13;
including investment funds and companies, is being developed.&#13;
3.18.  Lending Security; Collateral. The Law on Collateral was passed in 1995, extending the&#13;
relevant provisions of the Civil Code on the subject. The law applies to movable and immovable&#13;
property, rights and securities. The law requires registration of all types of collateral with a local notary&#13;
office or another authorized agency. Although the law establishes basic principles for using collateral in&#13;
commercial transactions, it needs to be strengthened. Several provisions make general reference to&#13;
other applicable legislation whereas, in order to promote lending, it would be preferable for this law to&#13;
be self contained; i.e. it should specify completely the rights of the parties in secured transactions.&#13;
Among its apparent deficiencies, the law fails to set up an efficient mechanism for foreclosure on and&#13;
sale of the secured property. It also needs more clarity on multiple-pledging, the proportion of a loan&#13;
that has to be collateralized, and the method of enforcing collateral rights. E.g. whereas the law&#13;
establishes a rule that the claims on collateral have to be brought to a court or an arbitration court (which&#13;
is itself unnecessary), commercial banks are exempt from this rule. To remedy these problems, given&#13;
the lack of legislative drafting capacity within the judiciary, it would be advisable to adopt a revised law&#13;
based on the model law on secured transactions published by the EBRD in 1995.&#13;
3.19.  Foreign Investment. The foreign investment law was passed in 1994. The law contains a&#13;
number of measures aimed at protecting foreign investors from the Government's discretion: i.e. the&#13;
law prohibits nationalization without compensation, and allows confiscation of foreign investor's&#13;
property only in cases of emergency upon payment of full compensation. Any damage caused by the&#13;
State or its agents has to be adequately compensated. Furthermore, an investor may enjoy a favorable&#13;
status granted to him by the previous laws for a period of five years where they have been changed to&#13;
the investor's disadvantage. Net profits are freely repatriatable and are not subject to a withholding tax.&#13;
Tax privileges on equipment import were reduced in 1995, and remain applicable only to investments&#13;
over a minimum threshold ($40,000). Some weaknesses include the lack of detailed mechanisms to&#13;
uphold the principles (e.g. if property is confiscated without a court order, the investor has to apply to&#13;
the courts for redress). Further, double taxation has yet to be addressed properly, and double taxation&#13;
treaties have so far only been signed with Bulgaria and Romania, outside the CIS.&#13;
3.20.  Land Law. The Land Code and the Law on Farms and Collectives were passed in 1991.&#13;
Agricultural land has already been fully privatized, but permanent registration of land is proceeding&#13;
slowly (with 25,000 certificates issued out of 315,000 privatized farms). USAID is supporting the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
development of a cadastral system. In the absence of title registration, transactions involving land are&#13;
not secure. For example, village councils still have rights to confiscate land which is "improperly used".&#13;
A new Law on Real Property was adopted in 1995. The law which covers land and other immovable&#13;
property, significantly clarifies the legal framework for private property sales. Unlike the Land Code,&#13;
the law on Real Property allows foreign legal entities to own real property, although it is still prohibited&#13;
for foreign citizens. The current Law on Collateral applies to secured transactions involving land and&#13;
other immovable property. However, adoption of a separate Law on Mortgage is expected in near&#13;
future.&#13;
3.21.  Enforcement of legal provisions. Improvements in judicial and administrative enforcement&#13;
are as important as the enactment of laws. Presently, there are courts of general jurisdiction in Armenia&#13;
which do not handle commercial disputes between legal entities, and one arbitration court in Yerevan&#13;
which has jurisdiction over commercial cases. The judges in both types of courts need extensive&#13;
training in commercial law which has undergone significant changes over the past several years. The&#13;
lack of efficient enforcement mechanisms undermines implementation of many newly enacted laws and&#13;
regulations in the areas of bankruptcy, anti-monopoly, collateral and property law. The Government has&#13;
started working on a comprehensive judicial reform program.&#13;
3.22.  The role of the project in the development of the legal framework for enterprises.&#13;
Considerable progress in the adoption of key legislation has been made by the Government during the&#13;
period under which this project has been prepared, and the development of the legal framework is&#13;
continuing. Under this operation preparation of selected legislation and regulations for the securities&#13;
market and investment fund licensing is being supported through technical assistance.&#13;
The Demand for Investment Finance&#13;
3.23   In order to estimate the potential demand for loan finance, a credit demand study surveyed&#13;
forty-seven companies interested in receiving loans. Estimated current loan demand by the surveyed&#13;
companies was between $5 million and $8 million. Thirty of the proposals were considered to be&#13;
viable, based upon assessments of their business structure, markets, collateral, and level of development;&#13;
and they were prepared to borrow in hard currency, and two thirds of the firms interviewed expressed&#13;
strong need for financing facilities on the terms likely to be available. The companies surveyed&#13;
included agriculture, food, non-food manufacturing, energy, service, and communications. A five-year&#13;
projection using a sectoral breakdown of credit demand showed that 50% of loan demand would come&#13;
from non-food manufacturing, 19% from food manufacturing, 4% from the energy sector, 18% from the&#13;
service sector, 4% from agriculture, and 5% from communications. Based on the survey midpoint&#13;
estimate of $6.5 million, a five year projection of credit demand is&#13;
indicated in Table 6.&#13;
Table 6: Projections of&#13;
Credit Demand          3.24.  This projection made conservative assumptions that (i)&#13;
US$ million          10% of the enterprise proposals from the 1996 survey were viable&#13;
1997      15.60         (US$0.65 million of investment), (ii) the 47 enterprises represent&#13;
1998      18.70         5% of the population of enterprises seeking financing; the total&#13;
1999      22.50         seeking financing would therefore be 940 out of  18,000&#13;
2000      27.00         enterprises registered), and; (iii) the annual growth rate is 20%&#13;
2001      32.40         based on calculations of the 1995 nominal GDP, the GDP growth&#13;
rate, and the current and estimated private sector percentage of&#13;
GDP.&#13;
3.25.  In addition to the above projections, the initial private sector study made estimates of a pipeline&#13;
of investment proposals to both the banks and the proposed PIFCA. Seventeen companies were visited&#13;
under the study, of which 12 were deemed 'probable' candidates for investment, while the remaining 5&#13;
were deemed 'possible', ranging from spirits and wine production to software development to shoe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
making. The study found little recorded demand for longer term financing within the banks at present,&#13;
largely due to the unwillingness of the banks to lend beyond 12 months, combined with very high&#13;
interest rates and collateral requirements. A number of small financing companies are also operating,&#13;
including the National Financial Investment Corporation, the Armenian Business Corporation and a&#13;
scheme funded by the Eurasia foundation. These entities financed about 12 enterprises over 1994 to&#13;
1995, with average subloan sizes of around US$50,000. A variety of investment proposals have also&#13;
been submitted by the Armenian Business Corporation, and the Armimpex Bank. Proposed projects&#13;
and interested enterprises ranged in diversity from copper ore production to cattle breeding to poultry&#13;
production. The various studies and sources of information that have been tapped, show satisfactory&#13;
potential demand for loan finance at the terms and conditions expected to be available under the&#13;
proposed operation, though detailed work would be needed to arrive at more definitive estimates. A&#13;
study of agroprocessing enterprise credit demand, showing considerable potential, is also under way as&#13;
part of a parallel Bank/IDA project.&#13;
3.26.  At the macro level, over the next ten years projections indicate that private foreign investment&#13;
and net long-term loans will replace private transfers and official grants to fill Armenia's resource gap.&#13;
As official grants are projected to decrease from $237 million in 1994 to $25 million in 2005, private&#13;
transfers and foreign investment are projected to increase from $36 million to $101 million and from&#13;
$2.6 million to $125 million respectively. Total private investment is projected to reach about US$300&#13;
million by 2001, implying a major increase in the requirement for financing.&#13;
&#13;

IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
Objectives and Scope&#13;
4.1.   This project is designed to complement and follow on from the Structural Adjustment Credit by&#13;
focusing on the post-privatization environment, financial and enterprise institution building, and the&#13;
expansion of private enterprise. The project will benefit the Government, the financial intermediaries,&#13;
the EDIPA, financial sector professionals, and beneficiary enterprises. The design of the operation was&#13;
discussed extensively with the Government, banks, potential investors, and other donor agencies,&#13;
including NGOs.&#13;
4.2.   After several difficult years, indications are that the economy has started to recover, the&#13;
banking sector is slowly strengthening, and the uncertainties surrounding investment in Armenia have&#13;
begun to ease. The continued stability of the exchange rate has also reduced the risk exposure of&#13;
enterprises borrowing in hard currency. These factors have created an opportunity for a major initiative&#13;
to channel much needed investment finance, both equity and debt, to the private sector, and to&#13;
strengthen financial institutions and enterprises. The objectives of the project are, on the demand side,&#13;
to increase the viability and bankability of Armenian companies through improved planning, and&#13;
development of export links and joint venture deals to enhance investment, imports, exports and&#13;
technology, and, on the supply side to strengthen the lending capacity of the banking system,&#13;
especially for export oriented projects, and to provide term finance for investment by private&#13;
enterprises. The project's objectives are: (i) to assist in financing such productive facilities and&#13;
resources in the Republic of Armenia as will contribute to the economic and social development&#13;
of the country, (ii) to strengthen commercial banks and other financial institutions and the capital&#13;
market, and (iii) to strengthen the investment and export market development capacity of private&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
Summary Project Description and Design features&#13;
4.3.   The project consists of an IDA (ITF) credit to the Government (borrower of record) for SDRs&#13;
11.6 million (US$16.75 million equivalent) available over 35 years maturity, 10-year grace period, and&#13;
0% interest rate and 0.75% annual service fee. It would consist of assistance to project management&#13;
through the PMU, plus the following components;&#13;
(i) Institution Building in Enterprises, Banks, and Capital Market&#13;
- Enterprise Support Fund and business adviser&#13;
- Advisory services to the banks and PIFCA&#13;
- Capital Markets assistance&#13;
(ii) Line of Credit&#13;
- To accredited Domestic banks&#13;
- To the PIFCA, when accredited&#13;

Survey of Project Demand&#13;
4.4.    To assess the level of demand for this type of operation, a survey of the perceived need for the&#13;
principal components of the project was carried out prior to project preparation, in 60 local enterprises&#13;
in both the State and private sector. Using a rating scale of I to 5, two thirds or more of respondents&#13;
rated the need for the project as satisfactory or high (3 to 5). The ESF also received 25% of responses&#13;
stating moderate to low interest (I to 2); among the overall responses on the ESF, the matchmaking&#13;
support drew a good response while, largely due to lack of experience of exporting, some enterprises&#13;
visited, mainly in the State sector, did not see a need for the export assistance fund. The overall result&#13;
was however quite satisfactory, and the design developed accordingly.&#13;
The Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
4.5.   Institution building. Bank/IDA involvement in direct enterprise strengthening through the&#13;
enterprise support fund is particularly timely as the Armenian private sector, including both newly&#13;
privatized and newly formed private companies, is at a take-off point, and public sector support is likely&#13;
to yield important externalities through the dissemination of international market knowledge and&#13;
business skills, which would be reflected in faster growth. This intervention would also be a critical&#13;
complement to the enhancement of lending capacity through boosting demand for finance by viable&#13;
(e.g. export-oriented) enterprises. IDA assistance in the area of financial institutions and capital&#13;
market development is similarly justified because of the incipient and fragile state of the financial&#13;
markets, and the accompanying level of uncertainty and perception of risk facing both savers and&#13;
investors which a public intervention could mitigate, thereby encouraging growth of the market.&#13;
Support to financial institutions would be an essential complement to the project's financing component&#13;
as it would directly strengthen both bank and non-bank institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
4.6.   Credit line. Despite the progress that has taken place, Armenia is still perceived as a high risk&#13;
environment in which up to now private sector fund inflows have been almost exclusively humanitarian;&#13;
the large Armenian Diaspora is currently looking to the international financial institutions to take the&#13;
lead on funding for investment.  The presence of  the IDA as a lender to domestic financial&#13;
intermediaries at this stage is regarded as important by the Government because it would be a logical&#13;
step from adjustment lending to targeted investment lending.&#13;
4.7.   In the case of the domestic banks, the IDA Line of Credit would be one of the first major&#13;
external financing initiatives in Armenia, and would initiate medium to long-term loan financing by the&#13;
banks. The credit, supported by technical assistance, is particularly important because it provides an&#13;
incentive to the domestic banks to build their capacity by achieving sufficient expertise to be accredited,&#13;
thereby ensuring that the project impacts on domestic financial sector development and reform. The&#13;
IDA has a critical role to play also in mitigating the uncertainties faced by potential enterprise-level&#13;
investors, and, by bringing eligible commercial banks actively into an investment project, the banking&#13;
policy dialogue would also be enhanced.&#13;
4.8.   A part of the Credit Line is expected to go to the PIFCA if it is established and accredited. The&#13;
PIFCA would be the first vehicle in Armenia mobilizing significant diversified foreign investment&#13;
resources including both equity and loans; it would come at an opportune moment as the economy&#13;
stabilizes and net inflows of foreign investment become feasible. The Bank (IDA)'s expected&#13;
involvement has helped to reduce perceived risk, thus encouraging private investors to come forward.&#13;
Support to the PIFCA would be developmental because it is effectively a pilot fund within an&#13;
embryonic financial market. The existence of the PIFCA would also be justified because of the limited&#13;
current capacity of the domestic banks to absorb significant investment credits, and the need to provide&#13;
a channel for investment finance over the next few years. IDA (ITF) funding for a credit line would be&#13;
complemented by institutional development support. IFC, with whom the credit was discussed, would&#13;
support the Bank's involvement at the early stage of market development, and would consider&#13;
participation later.&#13;
Bank Group Experience in Credit lines, and Lessons Learned&#13;
4.9.   The principal lessons relevant to this operation from other credit lines to support private&#13;
enterprises in the FSU and Eastern Europe have been as follows:&#13;
*  credit demand - the extent of demand on the terms that would be available from the PFIs has to be&#13;
clearly established, and an indicative pipeline developed; initial credits should be small, allowing&#13;
flexibility.&#13;
*  working capital - the provision of (short maturity) working capital loans, in addition to fixed&#13;
investment lending, is important to allow loan product flexibility, and to change the risk profile of&#13;
the banks' lending. To allow adequate working capital financing there should be no minimum&#13;
subloan maturity period.&#13;
*  streamlining of procurement - procurement procedures need to be as liberal as possible in the&#13;
prevailing market environment; this implies the use of "private commercial practices" to the&#13;
greatest extent possible.   Provided that prevailing procurement practices are sufficiently&#13;
competitive, private commercial practices should apply to contracts for goods and services.&#13;
*  technical assistance for banks and enterprises - to ensure a flow of bankable investment&#13;
proposals, and the capacity of the banks to handle them, technical support should be available to the&#13;
borrower enterprises and the participating banks in areas such as business plan preparation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
A. Institution Building Component&#13;
The Project Management Unit (PMU)&#13;
4.10.  The PMU is responsible for the overall implementation and management of the project (See&#13;
Chapter V). A total of US$0.37 million would be allocated to the PMU, of which US$0.27 million&#13;
would be from IDA (ITF), to finance an advisor for the line of credit for up to 18 months, training of&#13;
Armenian staff, and equipment.&#13;
The Enterprise Support Fund (ESF)&#13;
4.11.  Level of Support. The total cost of the ESF is estimated at US$4.55 million including&#13;
cofinancing from USAID and local contribution. Of this, US$ 3.50 million of IDA (ITF) funds would&#13;
be allocated to cover consulting services, staffing and operations, over a 26 month commitment period.&#13;
Of this, US$3.0 million would be to assist Armenian firms on a cost sharing grant basis to develop&#13;
export market plans and to establish joint-venture links with foreign firms; and US$0.5 million would be&#13;
to meet the administrative costs of the program. In addition, preparation costs of US$0.19 million&#13;
incurred or to be incurred prior to project launch have been met from PHRD Grant Funds.&#13;
4.12.  Purpose. The aims and method of operation of the ESF will be set out in its operational&#13;
manual. The ESF aims to enhance the competitiveness of private Armenian firms. The objectives are&#13;
to assist actual and potential private Armenian exporters search for, enter, and maintain export markets&#13;
and locate prospective joint-venture and contractual partners. The ESF is designed to overcome two&#13;
key problems: (a) poor export market focus due to lack of market development strategies to develop&#13;
existing and potential competitive advantages, and (b) inability to search out prospective foreign joint-&#13;
venture partners who could provide managerial and technical know-how and access to international&#13;
markets. The ESF would assist Armenian firms address these two problems by providing grant&#13;
financing to firms to partially meet their costs of contracting specialized consulting services in: (i)&#13;
export assistance, and (ii) interfirm matchmaking. Under normal circumstances, banks are reluctant to&#13;
lend for exports since risks are greater in comparison to lending for domestic sales. This is particularly&#13;
true for new exporters and start-ups. However, if the firm has gone through a systematic process of&#13;
analyzing and developing its competitive potential and/or has alliances with successful foreign firms,&#13;
then bank loans may be more forthcoming especially if banks have been involved in the support&#13;
program.&#13;
4.13.  The design of the proposed ESF is based on experience acquired from similar programs in other&#13;
countries, including India and Kenya. Some of the key lessons have been that, because the needs and&#13;
problems of each firm are unique and vary, enterprise support services must be tailored to the specific&#13;
competitive circumstances of individual firms. Therefore, the support must focus on assisting firms to&#13;
connect with and utilize experts who can provide the appropriate specialized services. Finally, strong&#13;
ownership and commitment by firms is ensured if they share part of the costs of the program. Annex 2&#13;
provides a draft Statement of Policies and Operating Procedures for the ESF Program.&#13;
4.14.  Fund Administration. The ESF would be located in the EDIPA. The EDIPA was established&#13;
in December 1995 as an agency under the Ministry of Economy. It has no regulatory role and its&#13;
mission is to provide fee-based advisory services to private Armenian enterprises and foreign investors.&#13;
The ESF would be administered by an Executive Director with support from an internationally recruited&#13;
Fund Manager. EDIPA would report to a Grant Approval Committee (GAC) to be established by the&#13;
Ministry of Economy which would be responsible for approving grants in excess of US$ 25,000 and&#13;
grants where the ESF cannot reach a decision (grant amounts below US$ 25,000 would normally be&#13;
jointly approved by the Executive Director of EDIPA and the Fund Manager), and supervising the&#13;
operations of the Fund. The GAC would be chaired by the Minister of Economy and would consist of&#13;
one representative each from the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Armenia, and three representatives from the private sector including at least one representative from the&#13;
commercial banking sector. The Chairman would have the authority to convene meetings or to simply&#13;
ask for no-objections from members. All decisions would be communicated to the PMU.&#13;
4.15.  ESF Staffing. For the first two years of operations, the ESF would be managed by the&#13;
international Fund manager who would assist the Director of EDIPA. However, in order to reduce costs&#13;
and create local capacity, program management responsibilities would be transferred to locally based&#13;
personnel during the third year of fund operations. Thus, two local fund managers would be recruited&#13;
and would be trained by the foreign fund manager. The ESF would also recruit, locally, two marketing&#13;
officers. Accounting and administrative services would be provided by EDIPA. The salary costs of the&#13;
Executive Director of EDIPA, the Fund Managers, Marketing Officers and the Accounting and&#13;
administrative staff would be financed over three years under the project.&#13;
4.16.  Eligibility Criteria. Only privately owned manufacturing, trading and service firms registered&#13;
in Armenia would be eligible. Privatized state-owned enterprises would be eligible provided they are&#13;
majority privately owned. For export market development, the ESF would assist exports from all&#13;
subsectors of the economy including service exports such as computer software and tourism. Grant&#13;
support would be given to target export markets where export proceeds would be realized in convertible&#13;
currencies. Export development and marketing activities aimed at barter transactions would not be&#13;
eligible for support. For matchmaking activities all sectors of the economy would be eligible as long as&#13;
the ultimate aim is to achieve a net inflow of resources in the form capital., technical know-how, or&#13;
revenue earnings.&#13;
4.17.  Eligible Activities. While the manager of the ESF would be the ultimate judge of the&#13;
eligibility of any specific activity for grant support, the broad eligibility criteria are as follows. Export&#13;
market development activities eligible for grant support would include the establishment of marketing&#13;
departments, overseas market research, travel to Armenia by potential buyers, minor product adaptation,&#13;
quality certification and assurance programs, product launch, sales or market promotion-related overseas&#13;
travel, test marketing, initial sales promotion, acquisition of blueprints and technical drawings, and&#13;
training. ESF grant finance would be extended for a range of non-investment activities that enable firms&#13;
to invest profitably for export production. Finance for working capital and machinery would not&#13;
however be provided except for minor tools, jigs and fixtures; testing and quality control equipment;&#13;
blueprints and drawings; and office equipment.&#13;
4.18.  ESF support for matchmaking activities would be given to secure foreign partnerships or&#13;
consultancy services for: (a) contract manufacturing; under this arrangement the technical partner&#13;
provides working capital in the form of raw materials or cash, and purchases output, while paying the&#13;
enterprise for its value-added; (b) technology transfer, where the foreign partner puts in equipment or&#13;
working capital and receives a share of the equity, profits, or production in return; (c) capital&#13;
investment, to upgrade and rehabilitate existing plant to bring it up to foreign market requirements, and;&#13;
(d) plant completion, where the foreign partner completes an unfinished plant at some fraction of the&#13;
greenfield cost and then operates it as an owner or shareholder to benefit from the resulting higher&#13;
returns. Contracts would be designed to ensure that the Armenian firm was safeguarded against&#13;
inadequate inputs by the intermediaries.&#13;
4.19.  Size of Grants and Cost Sharing. For export market development, the ESF would finance a&#13;
percent (up to 60% or a maximum of US$100,000) of the cost of eligible activities, to be determined in&#13;
the ESF operating manual. Financing would be on a grant basis with no repayment obligations.&#13;
Armenian firms would have to meet the remaining cost of eligible activities from their own resources.&#13;
In the case of matchmaking activities, because of the expected larger average cost per transaction, the&#13;
amount of assistance would be graduated to the size of the fees charged by the intermediary&#13;
matchmaker, on a basis to be determined in the operating manual of the ESF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
4.20.  Arrangements for Grant Approvals. The GAC would delegate to the Executive Director and&#13;
the Fund Manager powers to jointly approve individual grant support up to US$25,000 per applicant&#13;
under the ESF (if disagreements occur the GAC would also approve grants below US$25,000).&#13;
Proposals in excess of US$25,000 of ESF support, would normally be approved by the GAC at the&#13;
recommendation of the Fund Manager.&#13;
Business Advice&#13;
4.21.  Level of Support. US$0.29 million would be provided out of the IDA (ITF) Credit to support&#13;
the provision of an experienced adviser specializing in SME operations and finance, assisted by short&#13;
term foreign and local specialist consultants, and local staff, plus office equipment, over eighteen&#13;
months. The expert would establish an office within the EDIPA, reporting to the director.&#13;
4.22.  Purpose and Type of Support. Surveys have shown that planning capacity in enterprises is&#13;
critically lacking. The support to businesses in planning and analysis would complement the credit line&#13;
by assisting businesses to apply for loans by developing feasibility studies and business plans. In&#13;
addition the facility would provide general business advice, especially in planning, accounting, finance,&#13;
marketing and management.&#13;
4.23.  Fees and Administration for Business Advisory Assistance. Services would be provided to&#13;
the enterprise in return for a payment to the EDIPA to be passed on to an account in the PMU; the&#13;
payment would be calculated as a daily fee which would be a proportion of actual costs of the service&#13;
(about 20% subject to finalized operating procedures). Services would be provided on a first come-first&#13;
served basis, subject to payment of the fee according to an agreed payment plan. The administration of&#13;
the unit would be handled by the adviser in conjunction with the director of the EDIPA. The adviser&#13;
would with the EDIPA director develop the procedures for operations and fee payment.&#13;
Financial Institutions and Capital Markets Assistance&#13;
4.24   Level of Support. A total of US$3.09 million would support consultancy service, training and&#13;
equipment under this component of the project. Of this, US$1.69 million would be IDA (ITF) funded,&#13;
while the remainder would be financed by USAID, and by local sources. Of the total project amount,&#13;
support to the banks would total US$2.05 million. Support to the PIFCA would amount to US$0.25&#13;
million. Support for capital market development would be US$0.79 million.&#13;
Assistance to the Banks and the PIFCA&#13;
4.25.  Purpose. For the credit line to the domestic banks to be effective it is essential to ensure that&#13;
the banks' capacity is enhanced in credit management and appraisal, that they have made a start on&#13;
restructuring through portfolio audits and debt workouts, and that they have the capability for strategic&#13;
planning. In addition, assistance is needed to ensure that the PIFCA achieves early operational viability.&#13;
It is proposed that the bank assistance program be managed partly through a Banking Advisory Unit&#13;
(BAU). The USAID-financed Bankers Training Center (BTC) would operate alongside the BAU, with&#13;
the BAU responsible mainly for consultancy assistance and the BTC for training.&#13;
4.26.  Type of Support. The project would assist: (i) the commercial banks through training and&#13;
hands-on consultancy inputs in all institution-building areas, but particularly those connected with&#13;
accreditation for the line of credit, and; (ii) the PIFCA, to cover part of its local staff development costs.&#13;
The immediate need in the banks is for relatively intensive assistance to the management and staff of&#13;
certain commercial banks to help them achieve accreditation under the LOC. The advisory assistance&#13;
would involve intensive field visits over a period of several weeks designed to set up management&#13;
systems and strengthen specific departments, such as credit analysis. Special attention would be given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23 -&#13;
to SME credit administration. For the PIFCA, assistance would meet part of local staff training,&#13;
development costs over the first two years.&#13;
4.27.  Eligibility Criteria for Bank Assistance and Eligible Activities. All banks would be eligible&#13;
for advisory support, provided that they made the appropriate copayments. There would thus be an&#13;
element of self-selection. However, special attention would be given by the advisers to those banks&#13;
which had the greatest potential for participation under the line of credit. Eligible activities would&#13;
include improvement of term credit capacity, payments systems, accounting reforrn, portfolio&#13;
restructuring, debt workout, asset-liability management, and strategic planning. After the initial period&#13;
of preparing banks for participation in the line of credit, it would be expected that the program would&#13;
take on a more regular and longer term range of advisory and training work. The PIFCA would be&#13;
eligible for a technical assistance loan after accreditation. Eligible activities would include the costs of&#13;
recruitment of local trainee managers, and training of local management recruits (travel,&#13;
administration, and accommodation) over the first two years.&#13;
4.28.  Fees and Administration for Bank Assistance. Banking advisory services would be provided&#13;
on a grant basis to the recipient bank; the recipient bank would make a copayment to the PMU,&#13;
calculated as a daily fee which would be a proportion of actual costs (about 20%). The administration&#13;
of the BAU would be handled by the advisers themselves. In the case of the PIFCA, on accreditation,&#13;
technical assistance funds would be onlent by the govemment through the PMU at its IDA borrowing&#13;
cost plus a margin of 1.25%, making 2% in total. Maturity of the subsidiary loan would be ten years.&#13;
Capital Market Assistance&#13;
4.29.  Purpose.  Assistance is required to develop capital market infrastructure to facilitate&#13;
investments, the raising of capital, and the transfer of enterprise assets and securities (e.g. shares&#13;
acquired under the mass privatization program). This requires establishment of market agencies, skilled&#13;
personnel for those agencies, and the regulations that govern transactions by those agencies.&#13;
4.30.  Type of Support. Assistance would be provided to develop the regulations governing the role&#13;
and responsibilities of the SMS and securities market trading activity, and to provide initial training to&#13;
the regulators and participants in the market. The specific assistance required is for: (i) proposals and&#13;
recommendations for creation of a single, properly constituted securities regulatory body with a clearly&#13;
defined role, authority, and responsibilities; (ii) drafting and promulgation of basic major regulations&#13;
and guidelines governing securities transactions, (iii) training of a critical mass of regulators, traders and&#13;
brokers to provide the foundations of an efficient functioning capital market, and (iv) a public&#13;
information program. The training needs have been addressed by making a provision for short term&#13;
foreign intemships for both regulators and market participants, and for sustained on-the-ground training&#13;
in Armenia by foreign specialists in close coordination with the local stock exchanges.&#13;
Communications and computer equipment would be provided to the SMS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
B. The Credit Line Component&#13;
Overview&#13;
4.31.  The line of credit to PFIs would amount to US$11.0 million; this would be available to the&#13;
domestic banks and the proposed PIFCA, as soon as they are accredited. The subsidiary loan agreement&#13;
with the PFIs would provide for a prior allocation of funds to a PFI in return for payment of a&#13;
commitment fee, which would take the form of a reimbursable up-front payment of 0.5% of the&#13;
committed amount, reimbursed in proportion with the amount of the credit drawn down. The deadline&#13;
for applications under the line of credit would be January 1, 2002.&#13;
4.32.  In order to cover its operating costs, the MOE (PMU) would charge an administration fee of&#13;
0.5% to be added to the interest rate to subborrowers. The net spread to the Government would consist&#13;
of the difference between the borrowing cost of IDA (ITF) funds and the LIBOR-based onlending rate&#13;
on the Government's subsidiary loan to the financial institutions, net of the PMU fee. At a subsidiary&#13;
loan rate of 6-month US Dollar LIBOR plus 2%, the total net spread to the Government would currently&#13;
be about 6.5 to 7.0%. The net spread would provide funds to cover the Government's credit risk and&#13;
would provide resources to the central Budget.&#13;
Participating Financial Institutions&#13;
The Domestic Commercial Banks&#13;
4.33.  The Credit Line to The Commercial Banks. Conditions of participation would reflect the&#13;
need to strengthen banking and conform with CBA regulations. The credit would be available to any&#13;
accredited bank. The amount of the total line of credit accessed by the banks is expected to be about&#13;
US$5 million over the project life. Subloans using IDA (ITF) resources would be available for&#13;
financing subproject expenditures such as the procurement of machinery and equipment, spare parts, the&#13;
construction or purchase of plant, building or storage facilities associated with start-up or expansion&#13;
projects, and cost-effective investments in technology improvements and waste minimization which&#13;
would have environmental benefits. Permanent working capital would also be financed provided that&#13;
the subloan met the eligibility criteria specified in paragraph 4.39. The maximum credit available to&#13;
each commercial bank would be two times its capital and reserves, measured according to international&#13;
accounting standards. The line of credit would be targeted to private-sector small- and medium-size&#13;
companies registered and operating in Armenia and engaged in mining, manufacturing, agri-business,&#13;
energy services, commercial services, transport, communications, trade, and construction.&#13;
4.34.  The PFI onlending margin over borrowing cost would be determined by market conditions.&#13;
The funds received by the commercial banks from the servicing of subloans would be retained by the&#13;
banks for a maximum period of 10 years, and would be available for further lending within that period.&#13;
To prevent commercial banks deriving excess rents from access to relatively low cost foreign funds, a&#13;
review of onlending terms would be carried out at mid-term. If appropriate, and based on discussions&#13;
between IDA and the Government, a credit auction system could be introduced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
4.35.   Procedures, terms and conditions of Sub-Loans.  Sub-loans would be appraised and&#13;
approved by the participating commercial bank. Discussions with the banks have emphasized that there&#13;
would be no Government role in subloan decisions. In the case of the first three sub-loans of each&#13;
participating bank using the proceeds of the line of credit, and all sub-loans above a free limit of&#13;
US$150,000, subject to review at supervision, a prior "no objection" would need to be obtained from&#13;
IDA, based upon a recommendation from the commercial bank. Subloan evaluation guidelines would be&#13;
drawn up, acceptable to IDA, and approvals would be closely monitored through supervision visits to&#13;
ensure compliance with objective subloan criteria. Maximum subloan maturity would generally be&#13;
seven years, with 2 years grace period. Maximum subloan size would be limited by the bank's capital&#13;
base but would in any case be not more than US$0.5 million. The interest rate on each subloan would&#13;
be according to prevailing market conditions. Subborrowers would bear the exchange risk while the&#13;
lending PFI would bear the credit risk.&#13;
4.36.  Eligibility of Participating Banks. A set of eligibility criteria would be used to determine the&#13;
suitability of Armenian banks for participation in the credit line, taking account of the need to ensure&#13;
that the banks achieve adequate financial strength. These criteria are set out in full in Annex 5, and in&#13;
abbreviated form below. To qualify, a bank must be licensed by the CBA, and must: (a) have an&#13;
acceptable audit report in accordance with IAS; (b) have been in existence and produced&#13;
operating results for a minimum of two years except in the case of mergers of two or more&#13;
banks; (c) have a capital adequacy ratio as defined under IAS, incorporating a BIS risk-weighted&#13;
ratio of at least 4%, by January 1, 1997; (d) have a valid banking license and be in compliance&#13;
with all relevant banking laws and regulations of the Borrower; (e) have exposure to any one&#13;
borrower of no more than 30 percent of its IAS capital; (f) have aggregate exposure to insiders of&#13;
no more than 100 percent of IAS capital; (g) have adopted prudent policies and procedures with&#13;
respect to credit administration, loan servicing, and other key areas of banking practice; (h) have&#13;
established capacity for credit, accounting, environmental assessment and other functions&#13;
necessary to manage investment lending for enterprises. In addition, the PFI should have a&#13;
strategic corporate plan to fully convert its accounts to IAS as of January 1, 1998, increase its&#13;
capital adequacy ratio, as defined under IAS, beyond the minimum of 4 percent, and to&#13;
strengthen its arrangements for credit, accounting, environmental assessment.&#13;
4.37.  Eligibility of subborrowers. Clients of participating banks eligible for borrowing under the&#13;
line of credit facility would be expected to meet the following key criteria:&#13;
*  they must be in the private sector, with at least 51% of the voting shares being held by private legal&#13;
or physical persons, engaged in manufacturing, agribusiness, commercial services, trade,&#13;
construction, mining, energy services, transport and communications;&#13;
*  they must have a maximum debt-equity ratio of 3:1 with the proposed subloan.&#13;
*  they must be able to provide audited financial statements - including balance sheets and income&#13;
statements - for at least the past year.&#13;
4.38.  In addition, potential subborrowers would provide information as required by the PFI; these&#13;
would be expected to include data on major customers and suppliers, shareholders and Board members,&#13;
creditors and loan servicing status.&#13;
4.39.  Eligibility Criteria for Sub-Loans. Applications for sub-loans to the PFIs would be made in&#13;
accordance with the PFI's lending rules. It would be expected that they would be accompanied by&#13;
information on the enterprise, the appraisal of the subproject, and the proposed terms and conditions of&#13;
the subloan. In addition:&#13;
* the purpose of the loan must be directly related to the type of business in which the sub-borrower is&#13;
engaged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
*  the subproject must be technically financially and commercially viable.&#13;
*  the purpose of the sub-loan and the sub-borrower's activities must meet IDA criteria for&#13;
environmental soundness.&#13;
The PIFCA&#13;
4.40.  Governance and Establishment. If it is accredited, the PIFCA is expected to be the largest&#13;
intermediating PFI. Under its provisional business plan, its initial paid-in capital is expected to be about&#13;
US$3 million (of which EBRD would take 33%, and the remainder would come from the Midland Bank&#13;
(UK) and a private investor, W. A. Manoukian), contributed in installments. It is expected to be&#13;
established under the Companies Law, pending the adoption of an appropriate law relating to&#13;
investment corporations, which is under preparation. It would be governed by a Board of Directors&#13;
appointed by the shareholders, and would engage in borrowing, lending, equity investments, guarantees,&#13;
leasing, trading and issuance of securities and currency, and underwriting. However it would not accept&#13;
deposits or issue checking accounts. It would make medium to long term loans and equity investments,&#13;
and a range of subordinated loans and quasi-equity inputs. It would seek positions on investee company&#13;
boards in which it makes equity investments&#13;
4.41.  The PIFCA is expected to adhere to norms established in its corporate charter on loan,&#13;
contingent loan and investment exposure, including maximum size of investments and loans, connected&#13;
financing, and sectoral exposure limits, in relation to its total liabilities and its paid in capital. Subject to&#13;
shareholder agreement, individual loans and equity investments are likely to be limited to a maximum of&#13;
10% of its paid-in capital and reserves. An internationally recognized auditing firm would be&#13;
appointed, and the PIFCA would maintain accounts audited in accordance with Armenian law and&#13;
internationally accepted standards, reviewed by the general meeting of shareholders and approved by&#13;
the Board of Directors.&#13;
4.42.  It is intended that the founding investors would take long-term positions, but could in the future&#13;
sell their holdings, most likely through private sales. Additional investors, both foreign and local,&#13;
would be sought, privately or possibly through a public share offering, when the PIFCA has established&#13;
a stable level of business.&#13;
4.43.  The IDA (ITF) Credit Line to the PIFCA. On accreditation of the PIFCA, the credit onlent&#13;
by the Government would be provided to the PIFCA along with the loans from KfW and the EBRD for&#13;
use in enterprise finance. The PIFCA is expected to require over the project life IDA (ITF) credit&#13;
facilities of about US$6 million. Total lending to the PIFCA would be about US$17 million. In&#13;
addition, equity capital from the EBRD and private investors would total about US$3 million. The IDA&#13;
(ITF) credit expected to be used would therefore comprise about 36% of lending and about 30% of total&#13;
financing of the PIFCA.&#13;
4.44.  A subsidiary loan would be made from the MOE (PMU) to the PIFCA, and subloans or&#13;
investments would be made by the PIFCA to subborrower enterprises. A subsidiary loan from the&#13;
Government to the PIFCA is expected to carry a maximum maturity of 10 years at an interest rate of&#13;
LIBOR + 2%. Subloans would be granted at market rates with maturities of up to seven years, and&#13;
grace periods according to PIFCA investment policy as agreed by its shareholders.&#13;
4.45.  Subloans from the PIFCA using IDA (ITF) resources would be available for financing&#13;
subproject expenditures similar to those of the banks, including machinery and equipment, spare parts,&#13;
building or storage facilities, technology improvements and waste minimization, and permanent&#13;
working capital, subject to meeting eligibility conditions. Subloans would be granted subject to&#13;
conformance with the prudential guidelines set out in the PIFCA shareholders agreement and&#13;
appropriate Government regulations on loan exposure set out in upcoming legislation on investment&#13;
companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27 -&#13;
4.46.  PIFCA Eligibility Criteria. The PIFCA would have eligibility conditions distinct from those&#13;
of the commercial banks, applicable to a non-bank financial institution under international management,&#13;
namely that:&#13;
*  a corporate Charter has been adopted by the shareholders, acceptable to IDA&#13;
*  an institutional development plan (business plan) has been adopted, acceptable to IDA, by the&#13;
shareholders or Board of Directors.&#13;
*  capital structure, management, and prudential operating guidelines including capital adequacy,&#13;
accounting, investment and provisioning policy have been defined either in the business plan or the&#13;
charter.&#13;
*  the PIFCA has been registered in Armenia and its initial equity paid up.&#13;
4.47.  Subproject Eligibility. The management of the PIFCA would assess subloan applicants&#13;
according to internationally accepted norms. Existing sub-borrower enterprises would be expected to&#13;
provide past audited financial statements and evidence of solvency and profitability. Existing and new&#13;
subborrowers would be expected to provide detailed feasibility studies with projected financial&#13;
statements. The purpose of sub-loans financed by IDA (ITF) resources, and the sub-borrower's&#13;
activities, must meet IDA criteria for environmental soundness.&#13;
4.48.  Procedure, Terms and Conditions of Subloans. Subloans would be appraised by PIFCA&#13;
staff and approved by the Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of the PIFCA Policy Statement.&#13;
There would be no Government involvement in subloan or investment decisions. In the case of&#13;
subloans proposing to use the proceeds of the IDA (ITF) credit, approvals of subloans above a free limit&#13;
of US$300,000 and the first three approvals would require prior no-objection from the IDA. Maximum&#13;
and minimum subloan sizes would be determined as in the PIFCA investment policy statement.&#13;
Subloans would be granted at competitive interest rates prevailing in the market. Maturity and grace&#13;
periods would be the same as for the banks. Subborrowers would bear the exchange risk, while PIFCA&#13;
would bear the credit risk.&#13;

4.50.  The total project cost would be US$40.33 million, and the foreign exchange portion&#13;
US$31.75million, of which the IDA (ITF) component would be US$16.75 million. Local costs would&#13;
be US$8.58 million. It is assumed that the consulting fees paid to foreign consultants and import of&#13;
equipment would be exempt from taxes and duties.&#13;
4.51.  Under the Financing Component, the PIFCA would be expected to be financed to the extent&#13;
of about US$20.0 million in equity capital and loans, including the IDA (ITF) amount of about $6.0&#13;
million. Combined with estimated local financing by Armenian investors of $6.0 million, the total for&#13;
PIFCA would represent about 65% of project cost. The expected financing of the local banks would&#13;
be about US$5.0 million, with an additional amount of about US$1.0 million provided by the local&#13;
enterprises or banks. This would represent a total of 15% of project cost. The cost of the ESF is&#13;
estimated at US$4.55 million with an IDA (ITF) component of US$3.50 million. The cost of a Business&#13;
Adviser in EDIPA would be US$0.29 million. The Financial Institutions and Capital Market&#13;
program is estimated to cost US$3.09 million, of which IDA (ITF) would provide US$1.69 million; of&#13;
this, US$0.75 million would be allocated to the banking program handled by the BAU, US$0.69 million&#13;
to capital markets development, and US$0.25 million for the PIFCA. USAID would provide US$1.0&#13;
million through its proposed BTC.&#13;

V. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
5.1.   A number of options were considered in deciding on the management structure for the project.&#13;
The final structure was influenced by the need to simplify management of the various components as far&#13;
as possible. Thus the operation will be managed centrally through the PMU, established as part of the&#13;
Foreign Aid Coordination Center under the Ministry of the Economy.&#13;
The Project Management Unit&#13;
5.2.   The MOE (PMU) would facilitate the project in the following ways (refer also to the&#13;
organizational diagram on page 18): (i)for institution building: for the ESF and business advice service&#13;
the PMU would enter into an exchange of letters with the Enterprise Development and Foreign&#13;
Investment Agency (EDIPA). The PMU would provide grants through the EDIPA on behalf of the ESF&#13;
to beneficiary enterprises, and there would be copayments from the beneficiaries. Under the financial&#13;
institutions and capital market assistance program, the PMU would exchange letters with the CBA&#13;
which would accommodate the BAU, and through the SMS, would administer consultancy and training&#13;
for the capital market. The MOE(PMU) would enter into a subsidiary financing agreement on&#13;
applicable terms and conditions with the PIFCA after it is accredited, to provide a loan for the training&#13;
and local management costs during the startup period; (ii)for the line of credit: the MOE (PMU) would&#13;
enter into subsidiary loan agreements with the participating financial institutions (PFIs) (the eligible&#13;
domestic banks and the PIFCA) on the applicable terms and conditions.&#13;
5.3.   The PMU would be responsible for accounting (including management of the special account),&#13;
reporting, auditing, disbursement, procurement, environmental and compliance reviews for both the line&#13;
of credit and the institution building program. In the case of the LOC, the PMU would also cooperate&#13;
with the CBA who would, with IDA representatives, monitor the eligibility compliance of the&#13;
participating banks.&#13;
5.4.   The staffing of the PMU would be as follows: I line of credit adviser (expatriate); 1&#13;
manager/accountant (Armenian) who would assume responsibility for management of the LOC after I&#13;
year, and; 3 administrative assistants (covering both the line of credit and the technical assistance&#13;
components of the project). The adviser would work in conjunction with the director of the FACC and&#13;
would report to the MOE. (Terms of Reference, staffing and budget of the PMU are shown as Annex 1).&#13;
Enterprise Development and Foreign Investment Promotion Agency&#13;
5.5.   The ESF and the business adviser would be located in EDIPA. EDIPA was established in&#13;
December 1995 as an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Economy. It has no regulatory role,&#13;
and its mission is to provide fee-based advisory services to private Armenian enterprises and foreign&#13;
investors. The EDIPA is also supposed to coordinate all enterprise development technical assistance&#13;
programs supported by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies. The EDIPA has been established as a&#13;
non-profit, non-budgetary govemment agency which would be free to generate revenues and accept&#13;
private sector donations, and use the proceeds for its own operations with a view to eventually&#13;
becoming financially self supporting. Its charter provides for private participation in both management&#13;
and financing of operations. Preparation has started to hire management, draft operating procedures,&#13;
prepare lists of intermediary firms and a public relations program. The proposed organizational&#13;
structure for the ESF is given in Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
The ESF Grant Approval Committee (GAC)&#13;
5.6.   The Executive Director of EDIPA would report to a GAC to be established by the Ministry of&#13;
Economy under this project. The GAC would be responsible for setting the policies of the ESF on&#13;
grants, approving grants in excess of US$25,000 (grant amounts below US$25,000 will be jointly&#13;
approved by the Executive Director of EDIPA and the Fund Manager), and supervising the operations&#13;
of the Fund. The GAC would be chaired by the Minister of Economy, or equivalent of Ministerial rank,&#13;
and would consist of one representative each from the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, and&#13;
the CBA. It would also have three representatives from the private sector including at least one&#13;
representative from the commercial banking sector. The chairman would have the power to convene&#13;
meetings of the GAC or to ask for no-objections from members.&#13;
5.7.   BAU and SMS. The banking assistance program would be administered by the PMU through&#13;
the BAU, and the capital market program through the MOF (SMS). Some contracts may be handled&#13;
initially by the PMU directly. The work program would be subject to agreement with the CBA and the&#13;
Commercial Bankers Association. The BAU would have a consultancy or hands-on assistance function,&#13;
available to all financial institutions on a fee basis of a percentage of total costs. The BAU would be&#13;
housed within the CBA, alongside the Bankers Training Center which is being established under the&#13;
auspices of USAID in collaboration with the Commercial Bankers Association.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
5.8.   For all components of the project, supervisions would be carried out about three times a year.&#13;
Annual reviews would be undertaken to review progress, assess performance against the&#13;
implementation plan and monitorable indicators, discuss emerging needs, and decide on necessary&#13;
adjustments. Special concems would be the performance of the PMU in relation to its terms of&#13;
reference; in addition, for the PIFCA: (i) continuing accreditation compliance, (ii) eligibility&#13;
compliance of subborrower enterprises, and (iii) rate of disbursement; for the local banks, (i)&#13;
accreditation fulfillment and compliance of the banks, (ii) audit reporting, and (iii) rate of disbursement;&#13;
for the ESF, (i) performance of the EDIPA; (ii) rate of disbursement; (iii) adherence to and&#13;
effectiveness of policies and procedures; (iv) effectiveness of consultancy assistance. For the financial&#13;
institutions and capital market program, effectiveness of consultancy assistance would be the focus.&#13;
5.9.   A project supervision plan is included as Annex 7. A first supervision combined with a project&#13;
launch would be expected to take place in January 1997. A midterm review would take place in about&#13;
October 1999.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
5.10.  Procurement of goods and works will be govemed under the Bank/lDA's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines dated January 1995, revised January and August 1996, and the Guidelines: Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). Since&#13;
the project will be financed out of the Interim Trust Fund, the countries that are ineligible to borrow&#13;
from the IBRD or IDA and that do not participate in financing of the ITF will be ineligible sources for&#13;
the purposes of procurement. The Country Procurement Assessment Review for Armenia is under&#13;
preparation and is likely to be finalized before the end of 1996. A GPN will be published in November&#13;
1996. The project launch workshop will be organized in January 1997.&#13;
5.11.  Prior Review: The Bank/IDA's prior review would apply to all contracts for goods and works&#13;
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$500,000 or more, according to the procedures set out in&#13;
Appendix I of the Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
5.12.  ICB: All contracts of above US$500,000 for goods and works will be awarded on the basis of&#13;
ICB and will be subject to the Bank/IDA's prior review. Local suppliers and contractors will be eligible&#13;
for domestic preference margins in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. The Borrower will use&#13;
standard bidding documents for ICB contracts. This category will amount to about US$1.0 million.&#13;
5.13.  International shopping: Goods and equipment estimated to cost US$0.5 million or less will be&#13;
procured through international shopping on the basis of three price quotations from two different&#13;
countries. This category will amount to about US$5.0 million&#13;
5.14.  Commercial Practices: Goods estimated to cost US$100,000 or less may be procured on the&#13;
basis of sound commercial practices including multiple quotations. This category will amount to about&#13;
US$3.0 million. The acceptance of commercial practices in Armenia for private sector procurement is&#13;
based on surveys of local companies and a liberal import regime which permits international&#13;
competition.&#13;
5.15.  National Competitive Bidding: Contracts for works estimated to cost below US$0.5 million&#13;
would be procured on the basis of NCB and the Borrower would use the Bank/IDA's sample bidding&#13;
documents dated August 1995. The Bank/IDA would preview the first three NCB contracts. This&#13;
category will amount to about US$1.5 million&#13;
5.16.  National Shopping - Small Works: Smaller contracts estimated to cost below US$100,000&#13;
would be procured under lumpsum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from three&#13;
qualified domestic contractors in response to written invitation. This category will amount to about&#13;
US$0.5 million.&#13;
5.17.  TA and Consultants' Services: Annex 8 provides details of the various TA and consulting&#13;
services and proposed selection methods. All major packages will be procured on the basis of&#13;
shortlisting of firms. There will however be direct contracting for the training for the local staff and&#13;
management of the PIFCA, for the ESF fund manager, and for some other smaller contracts. The terms&#13;
of reference for each consulting assignment will be previewed and approved by the IDA. IDA will also&#13;
preview consultants contracts above US$100,000 in the case of firms, and US$50,000 in the case of&#13;
individuals. Competitive contracting will apply to contracts worth about US$4.5 million, and individual&#13;
contracting will apply to contracts worth about US$1.0 million.&#13;
5.18.  Implementationj  Implementation, including procurement, will be the responsibility of the&#13;
PMU. Procurement-related TA will be provided to the PMU to ensure compliance with the Bank/IDA's&#13;
guidelines and procedures. The PMU will submit quarterly progress reports which will include&#13;
procurement activities.&#13;

Disbursements&#13;
5.19.  Special Account (SA).  To facilitate project implementation, the PMU would open and&#13;
maintain a Special Account in a major commercial banks under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA&#13;
to cover the IDA (ITF) share of expenditures. The Special Account would be used to disburse IDA&#13;
(ITF) funds under all components. The Special Account would have a maximum authorized allocation&#13;
of US$1.6 million, representing about four months of average expenditures made through the special&#13;
account. During the early stages of the project the initial allocation to the Special Account would be&#13;
limited to US$1.0 million. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached&#13;
the level of US$5.0 million the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of&#13;
US$1.6 million by submitting the relevant application for withdrawal. Applications for replenishment&#13;
of the special Account would be submitted monthly or when one third of the amount has been&#13;
withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. The withdrawal application would follow the standard IDA&#13;
procedure supported by appropriate documentation as described in the Disbursement Handbook, chapter&#13;
6. The SA would be opened in the name of the Government and administered by the PMU which will&#13;
send requests to IDA for replenishment. These requests would be accompanied by detailed monthly&#13;
bank statements of the SA which have been reconciled by the borrower.&#13;

using the proceeds of the Credit. Disbursement would either reimburse the PFI's expenditure or would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34-&#13;
be made directly to suppliers from the credit account. Disbursements would generally occur against&#13;
proof of payment in accordance with the approved contract. Expenditures for individual goods and&#13;
works contracts valued at under US$0.5 million, financed by subloans, would be disbursed from the&#13;
loan account against statements of expenditure certified by the PMU. Expenditures of above US$0.5&#13;
million would be made out of fully documented withdrawal applications. The PMU would ensure that&#13;
the documentation was available for inspection at supervision. Expenditures for equipment for the&#13;
PMU would be disbursed according to statements of expenditure.&#13;
5.21.  Under the ESF, business advisory and bank advisory programs, enterprises will make&#13;
copayments at the time of disbursement of IDA (ITF) funds on activities financed, through a separate&#13;
PMU account into which the beneficiary's share of payment will be deposited. Applications for&#13;
payment would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure for goods of less than $0.5 million,&#13;
for consulting services of below US$100,000 equivalent for firms, and below US$50,000 equivalent for&#13;
individuals. At the time of approving each grant proposal under the ESF, EDIPA would notify the&#13;
PMU. When payments for goods and services have to be made under an approved grant proposal,&#13;
EDIPA would request the PMU to make the necessary disbursements. At the time of making this&#13;
request, EDIPA would ensure that the enterprise receiving the grant has deposited its copayment. The&#13;
PMU would draw on the Special Account for up to the amount eligible for funding under the ESF, and&#13;
the balance would be drawn from the copayment account.&#13;
5.22.  Retroactive financing for subprojects procured according to the Guidelines after November 1,&#13;
1996 is proposed up to a limit of US$1.6 million equivalent, equal to about 10% of the amount of the&#13;
loan.&#13;
5.23.  The Project would be implemented over five years, with a completion target date of January 1,&#13;
2002. The credit closing date would be July 1, 2002, with last date for drawdown being six months&#13;
after the date of credit closing. The ESF would be expected to disburse within three years.&#13;

Accounting, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
5.24.  Accounting. The Goverrment will have the responsibility for the appropriate accounting for&#13;
the funds provided by the IDA (ITF) under the credit, for reporting on the use of these funds and for&#13;
ensuring that financial statements or reports are submitted. The PMU manager will establish an&#13;
appropriate accounting system for receipt and use of funds in accordance with the credit agreement.&#13;
5.25.  Auditing and Reporting.  For each component of the project the managing intermediaries&#13;
would establish and maintain separate project related accounts in a format acceptable to IDA. These&#13;
accounts, and the special account, would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The audited accounts would be submitted to the PMU not later than three months from the end of&#13;
each fiscal year, and the PMU would forward the accounts to IDA. The auditors selected must be (a)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
impartial and independent of the entity to be audited, (b) well established and reputable, (c) experienced&#13;
in the type of assignment to be undertaken, and (d) able to fulfill the terms of reference required within&#13;
the specific timetable.&#13;
5.26.  IDA would require reports on a quarterly basis. For the Line of Credit, reporting would&#13;
include regular quarterly reports of, inter alia, subloan commitments and disbursements financed by the&#13;
IDA (ITF) credit, sub-borrower debt service, and other information required for effective monitoring,&#13;
and an annual audit by an auditor acceptable to IDA (ITF). IDA quarterly supervision missions, carried&#13;
out in conjunction with the Government, would require access to regular and other reports, and access to&#13;
subprojects for site visits. For the Banking and Capital Markets program, quarterly reports would be&#13;
provided by the BAU and by the SMS and provided to the PMU. The PIFCA management would&#13;
submit to the PMU quarterly reports on the progress of the management training program. For the ESF,&#13;
reports would include a summary of all grants disbursed below and above the free limit, and the&#13;
justification for the award. EDIPA would submit monthly progress reports, in a format acceptable to&#13;
IDA, to the GAC for review and approval. After approval by the GAC, EDIPA would forward these&#13;
reports to the PMU who in turn would forward them to IDA. EDIPA would also submit quarterly&#13;
reports to the PMU on the work of the Business Advisor.&#13;

VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Environmental Review&#13;
6.1.   The character of the subprojects under the line of credit is not known in advance, although they&#13;
will be limited in scale. However, to allow for the possibility that some subprojects (such as food&#13;
processing, chemicals and metals) may have significant environmental impacts, the project is classified&#13;
as category B.&#13;
6.2.   The Republic of Armenia has an environmental regulatory system in place, largely inherited&#13;
from the former Soviet Union, that the Government is now attempting to adapt to changing&#13;
circumstances.  An IDF grant has been approved to assist in the development of appropriate&#13;
environmental policy and regulations. A Law on Environmental Assessment was adopted in January&#13;
1996. The Government has also requested Bank assistance in revising current environmental laws, and&#13;
using national resource fee systems and economic instruments in place of the largely ineffective Soviet&#13;
system. A National Environmental Action Plan will be in place by 1997.&#13;
6.3.   As part of the eligibility conditions for PFIs, a capability to undertake environmental&#13;
assessments is required, and for each subloans an environmental impact statement would be required.&#13;
The procedures will be agreed with IDA prior to effectiveness. Environmental screening procedures&#13;
would specify a negative list of activities with known hazardous impacts which would not be financed.&#13;
An investors guidebook for environment, health, and safety is being prepared in conjunction with the&#13;
Bank/IDA and the EBRD to provide background to potential investors on applicable environmental&#13;
regulations, licensing, land use codes and the like. A model environmental assessment manual for&#13;
subprojects has been provided to the Government.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
6.4.   Link to CAS. This operation is an integral part of the country strategy. It marks the transition&#13;
from the rehabilitation and macroeconomic adjustment phase of IDA support to Armenia, to&#13;
intervention at the post-privatization and sectoral restructuring level. This operation focuses on the&#13;
rationalization and recovery of production within the newly forming private sector by addressing key&#13;
bottlenecks in enterprise financing, business skills and institutional development.&#13;
6.5.   Policy Environment. Armenia is one of the most successful countries of the FSU in its&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization program. Its budget deficit was reduced very substantially over 1994 to&#13;
1995, while the monthly inflation rate has fallen to a low level. Liberalization and stabilization of the&#13;
domestic currency vis-a-vis the US dollar has started to stimulate capital inflows. Export taxes and&#13;
quantitative import restrictions have been removed, and the maximum import tariff reduced to 10%.&#13;
Price distortions have been largely eliminated. Interest rates are determined at auction and part of total&#13;
credit is made available through CBA refinancing auctions to banks able to offer acceptable collateral.&#13;
The remainder is offered at the auction-determined monthly interest rate, which has been positive in real&#13;
terms for the past year. The interest rate on subsidiary loans under the project would be dollar-&#13;
denominated and positive in real terms.&#13;
6.6.   Core Economic Objective. The main objective of the project is to support a market-driven&#13;
private sector investment and production response to the economic adjustment process. The resumption&#13;
of economic growth in Armenia, the increase in capacity utilization, and the fast rate of privatization&#13;
will create a good basis for the rapid growth of private business. The Project aims to start to mobilize&#13;
external investment, which has been unavailable since the break up of the FSU, to stimulate the exports&#13;
and foreign investment that are essential to economic recovery, and to mobilize local savings by&#13;
strengthening the capacity of the banks and capital market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
6.7.   Achievement of Core Economic Objective. Technical assistance will address weaknesses in&#13;
the banking system, such as portfolio management, credit management, and loan appraisal, thereby&#13;
moving the financial reform process forward, and will build capacity in capital market institutions. The&#13;
Project, combined with the perceived improvement in the economy and supported by the Bank/Fund&#13;
dialogue, has already succeeded in mobilizing investor interest internationally and domestic enterprise&#13;
and banking interest. By addressing key deficiencies in competencies of firms that impact on credit and&#13;
project risks, the ESF will also improve the bankability of projects to be financed under the Line of&#13;
Credit, through promoting international marketing, technological and trade contacts with Armenian&#13;
companies. The provision of investment finance through the domestic banks and the PIFCA would&#13;
provide the resources to fund the establishment, or expansion, of efficient private sector investment&#13;
projects in a range of production and services, thereby financing growth of production. Finance will&#13;
also create incentives for the strengthening of the banking system to mobilize savings for investment.&#13;
6.8.   Institutional Capacity and Regulatory Framework. The Project will strengthen the capacity&#13;
of an important and needed local institution - the EDIPA, which will coordinate enterprise-related&#13;
foreign assistance in Armenia, and it will also establish a banking advisory service as part of a Bankers&#13;
Training Center, which will provide assistance through training and consultancy to build capacity in the&#13;
banks. The project will also assist the creation of an autonomous securities regulatory body and&#13;
strengthen professional expertise in institutions such as the SMS, and will also strengthen the financial&#13;
sector regulatory framework.&#13;
6.9.   Fiscal Impact. The line of credit will provide budgetary resources to the Govermment through&#13;
the spread between the cost of IDA (ITF) funds, and the onlending rate of the subsidiary loan (10 years&#13;
at LIBOR plus 2%) from the Government to the participating financial institutions, less the cost of&#13;
administering the PMU. Part of the spread to the Government should also be seen as coverage for its&#13;
credit risk in the event of default by a PFI. The direct net budgetary benefit will depend on the rate of&#13;
disbursement of the credit line. Based on a 7% net spread to Government, the present value at 10% of&#13;
the net fiscal benefit accruing to the Government from the line of credit would be about US$2 million&#13;
over the 6 year life of the credit line. The ESF consultancy funds, along with the funding of the&#13;
associated administrative costs, are expected to be passed on a grant basis to the EDIPA.  The&#13;
Government would therefore bear a fiscal cost amounting to the cost of funds (0.75% per annum) and&#13;
its own share of the operating cost of the EDIPA. This would be offset by the copayments by recipient&#13;
banks averaging about 25% of costs. The net present worth of the net fiscal expense associated with&#13;
the financial provision for the ESF would be about US$100,000. In the case of PIFCA institutional&#13;
support, funds are expected to be onlent by the Government at IDA borrowing cost plus a margin for&#13;
administration, with a zero net budgetary impact. Copayments for assistance from the BAU and the&#13;
Business Adviser would result in a small net positive budgetary impact.&#13;
6.10.  The positive direct fiscal impact would be enhanced by indirect fiscal benefits from the creation&#13;
of new productive capacity. The technical assistance should therefore be seen as an investment yielding&#13;
an enhanced stream of future fiscal inflows. The successful implementation of the line of credit and&#13;
technical assistance will result in the broadening of the tax base through new businesses and&#13;
employment.&#13;
6.11.  Analysis of Alternatives. During project preparation, a number of alternative approaches were&#13;
considered for the project. The main considerations were on the one hand the weakness of the financial&#13;
sector and on the other hand the critical need for investment finance. The former suggested either&#13;
waiting for additional reforms to take effect or focusing on a technical assistance operation alone to&#13;
strengthen the banks and enterprise borrowers. However, the latter implied strongly the need to find a&#13;
viable and effective channel to mobilize investment finance. Mobilization of investment through a&#13;
guarantee operation was initially considered, but the progress of preparation of the PIFCA suggested&#13;
that the PIFCA would be an appropriate alternative. The participation of the domestic banking sector&#13;
has also now become feasible as a result of strengthening of the financial positions of several banks over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
the past year, as shown through portfolio audits. Access to the line of credit is also expected to provide&#13;
a strong incentive effect on the banks to fulfill accreditation criteria. The final design of the project&#13;
combined institution building with a line of credit accessible to both the banks and the PIFCA.&#13;
6.12.  Cost-benefit Analysis. There is little evidence currently of rates of return that are being&#13;
achieved by long-term investors in Armenia. However, the credit demand study showed considerable&#13;
interest from potential investors in borrowing at the rates for foreign currency loans which would&#13;
prevail under the proposed credit (the subsidiary loan rate plus a margin of about 5%). Such enterprises&#13;
would therefore be expecting financial rates of return of at least 15%.&#13;
6.13.  Analysis of the sensitivity of the estimated rates of return to possible policy changes and&#13;
sovereign risks can only be tentative. However, the continuing progress in improving the policy&#13;
environment and implementing strict macroeconomic measures, and the growing geopolitical&#13;
stabilization, strongly indicate that the number of opportunities for profitable business will grow. The&#13;
proposed line of credit, which is modest in scale, can easily be topped up if it proves successful.&#13;
6.14.  The residual effects of the blockade, especially on oil supply, would have the effect of&#13;
increasing cross-border transport costs, thereby lowering real export FOB prices, and increasing import&#13;
CIF prices. Thus the alleviation of the blockade will allow export prices to rise and import prices to fall.&#13;
Economic analysis of subprojects would have to take account of these movements in estimating future&#13;
border prices. Aside from this complication, the absence of major distortions, as described above,&#13;
means that financial rates of return on subprojects would tend to reflect economic rates; and the stability&#13;
of the reform process means that a divergence is relatively unlikely to occur in the future, so that&#13;
financial rates of return will continue to approximate real rates.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
6.15.  Line of Credit. Given the shortage of domestic savings and lack of investment finance&#13;
available on prevailing terms, the benefits of the LOC are expected to be provided through the easing of&#13;
the financing constraint, and the development of capacity in the banking system inter alia to develop and&#13;
appraise projects. A total of about 30 to 50 subprojects (at US$120,000 to US$200,000 per subproject)&#13;
are expected to be financed under credit to the PIFCA when it is accredited, and 40 to 80 subprojects (at&#13;
about US$50,000 to 100,000 per subproject) through credit to the domestic banks.&#13;
6.16.  Enterprise Support Fund. The ESF would contribute to exports by: (a) assisting 80 to 100&#13;
private Armenian firms increase their shares in international markets. Experience elsewhere suggests&#13;
that export support programs of this type could yield incremental export revenue of a multiple of at least&#13;
ten times the cost of assistance; (b) assisting Armenian firms internalize marketing skills and thus make&#13;
them more bankable; (c) assisting about 50 to 60 Armenian firms establish international contacts and&#13;
close deals in trade, technology and investment. Based on fees of around 3-5% of the transaction value&#13;
and an average copayment rate of up to 50%, a $1 million aggregate intervention could result in an&#13;
aggregate inflow of as much as $40 million in direct foreign investment of various forms; (d)&#13;
developing domestic private sector capacity in provision of export consulting services; and (e) assisting&#13;
EDIPA develop capacity in delivery of enterprise support services.&#13;
6.17.  Banks and Capital Market. This program is expected to yield direct benefits through skill&#13;
enhancement within the banks, the securities regulatory agency (SMS) and the main securities&#13;
marketing entities, and development of the regulatory environment. PIFCA. Institutional support is&#13;
expected to yield benefits through localization of management by year 3 of operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Project Risks and Risk Management&#13;
6.18.  GeneraL The reform progress of the past few years suggests that the risk of policy reversals or&#13;
loss of reform momentum in Armenia is low. An IDA investment in such an environment may&#13;
therefore be regarded a being an acceptable risk.&#13;
6.19.  The Enterprise Support Fund faces three particular risks:  (i) the environment may be&#13;
constrained by underdeveloped legal and institutional structures that discourage foreign firms from&#13;
entering into long-term relationships with Armenian firms; (ii) working capital and investment finance&#13;
constraints may prevent firms from implementing export, import, or technological upgrading plans, and;&#13;
(iii) EDIPA is a new institution with limited experience in delivering enterprise support services that are&#13;
valued by firms. The first risk is being addressed since, with IDA assistance, the Government is rapidly&#13;
implementing laws and establishing institutions for a well-functioning market economy. In the second,&#13;
with IDA assistance, the Government is implementing reforms aimed at improving the financial&#13;
viability of the banking system and in the interim the IDA is providing financial resources through the&#13;
Line of Credit. The third risk is being addressed by providing EDIPA with the services of an&#13;
experienced international manager to implement the ESF program and by providing local staff with&#13;
overseas and on-the-job training. For the Banks and Capital Market, and for the Business Adviser, the&#13;
main risk is failure to deliver effectively the know-how to the banks and securities agencies. A risk&#13;
facing the BAU is that it will not be able to deliver advisory services soon enough for timely bank&#13;
accreditation. These risks will be mitigated through careful design of the program, and include cost-&#13;
sharing provisions in order to ensure adequate commitment by the agencies involved, and in the case of&#13;
the BAU by accelerated procurement which is under way.&#13;
6.20.  The Line of Credit faces three main risks. These are: (i) risk of a deterioration of the political&#13;
situation leading to an increase in cross-border trade disruption; (ii) bank systemic risk - the risk of&#13;
bank failures or inability to achieve accreditation standards which prevents the credit being disbursed,&#13;
and; (iii) risk of inadequate demand by eligible subborrowers or inadequate project preparation skills.&#13;
The first of these risks is partly outside Armenia's control, but is mitigated because of the progress in&#13;
international negotiations; the second is mitigated because of the tight control of the CBA, the support&#13;
of the BAU, and the likely participation of the PIFCA, which would be well capitalized, managed by a&#13;
reputable international investor, and is expected to be able to absorb a major part of the credit line. The&#13;
third risk has been addressed through a credit demand study. Satisfactory demand for loans from viable&#13;
borrowers at the terms and conditions offered has been projected over the next few years, and project&#13;
preparation skills would be developed through the BAU, the Business Advisory Service, and a number&#13;
of donor projects supporting enterprises.&#13;
Monitoring And Evaluation&#13;
Performance Indicators&#13;
6.21.  Performance indicators have been designed to allow the effective monitoring of the progress of&#13;
the project. The monitoring and reporting on the performance of the project will be the responsibility of&#13;
the PMU, which would supply to supervision missions the latest information in the following areas.&#13;

ARMENIA&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Enterprise Support Fund&#13;
Draft Policies and Operating Procedures&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    The aim of the Enterprise Support Fund (ESF) is to: (a) increase the competitiveness of&#13;
Armenian exports and to assist actual and potential exporters to search, enter and maintain export&#13;
markets and (b) assist enterprises to locate prospective joint-venture partners. The ESF will&#13;
overcome two key constraints faced by enterprises: (a) poor market focus and lack of systematic&#13;
export market development strategies that exploit the existing and potential comparative&#13;
advantages of Armenian enterprises and (b) inability to tap into trade and investment networks.&#13;
The specific objective of the ESF is to motivate and assist individual private Armenian firms&#13;
in the preparation and implementation of cost-effective export expansion plans and in locating&#13;
foreign joint-venture partners with the help of consultants specializing in marketing, design,&#13;
packaging, quality, finance, engineering and investment brokering. A subsidiary objective of the&#13;
ESF is to also strengthen local capabilities in delivery of specialized exporter support services.&#13;
In order to achieve these objectives the ESF will provide grant assistance to Armenian&#13;
enterprises to partially finance the cost of achieving the aforementioned objectives.&#13;
Resources&#13;
2.    Resources. During a three year commitment period, the ESF will be supplied with&#13;
US$3.5 million (of which US$3.0 million will be for consulting services to firms) of IDA (ITT)&#13;
funds to finance, on a matching-grant basis, eligible activities undertaken by private Armenian&#13;
firms. US$0.5 million will be for the start-up and operating costs of the ESF. Total payments,&#13;
including local payments and enterprise co-payments, will amount to a total of about US$ 4.55&#13;
million.&#13;
Eligibility Criteria&#13;
Eligible Firms&#13;
3.    To be eligible Armenian firms must be in the private sector. A firm will deemed to be&#13;
private if at least 51 percent of outstanding shares are held by private individuals or where&#13;
management control is in private hands. In addition, privatized state-owned enterprises will also&#13;
be eligible. All manufacturing, trading and service establishments that meet these definitions&#13;
will be eligible.&#13;
Eligible Sectors&#13;
4.     Support under the ESF will be open generally to all sectors of the economy, subject to&#13;
review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
Eligible Activities&#13;
5.     The ESF will support two broad categories of activities: (A) activities aimed at&#13;
preparing Export Marketing Plans (Export Market Development), and (B) activities aimed at&#13;
establishing joint-venture links with foreign partners (Match Making). The activities eligible to&#13;
be financed under each category are as follows:&#13;
A. Export Market Development&#13;
6.     Eligible Export Markets. Grant support will be given only for those target markets in&#13;
which export sales are realized in convertible currencies. Priority will be given for export&#13;
development plans aimed at industrialized markets. Export development and marketing&#13;
activities aimed at protocol trade or barter transactions will not be eligible for support.&#13;
7.     Eligible Activities. The aim of the ESF is to encourage a strategic perspective on export&#13;
markets based on stable buyer-seller relationships. Such relationships are necessary for&#13;
sustaining and increasing exports in the medium to long-term. Hence, under the ESF grant,&#13;
fimance will be provided for all activities that prepare firms to enter into long-term buyer-seller&#13;
links. However, working capital requirements will not be supported. Further, the ESF will not&#13;
finance acquisition of plant and machinery with the exception of items such as minor tools, jigs&#13;
and fixtures; testing and quality control equipment; blueprints and drawings; and office&#13;
equipment. A number of market development activities can qualify for support. Ultimately, the&#13;
Manager of the ESF, in conjunction with the fund manager, will have to make a judgment&#13;
regarding the eligibility of any proposed activity. However, for the purposes of illustration and&#13;
guidance a typical list of eligible activities would include the following:&#13;
* Desk Research. This activity aims at assisting the firm in undertaking a preliminary analysis&#13;
of most promising export prospects, internal capabilities of the firms, and analysis of&#13;
competition. This activity is based on information available on site and may be undertaken&#13;
in collaboration with the Fund Manager. The quality of desk research is often an important&#13;
indicator of the firms willingness to enter export markets. This activity is the initial step in&#13;
the development of an export marketing strategy.&#13;
* Overseas Field Market Research. This activity provides the main inputs into the formulation&#13;
of an export marketing strategy. It aims to answer basic questions relating to products, target&#13;
markets, target buyers, buyer requirements, purchasing decisions, distribution channels,&#13;
competition, and main factors effecting demand for the firm's products. Typically, this&#13;
activity is undertaken in collaboration with consultants who have detailed knowledge about&#13;
specific products and markets.&#13;
* Minor Product Adaptation. This activity aims at making Armenian products more&#13;
acceptable to overseas buyers. Under this activity support will be given for advisory and&#13;
technical services relating to process, product and packaging redesign.&#13;
* Overseas TraveL During the process of developing an export marketing strategy, company&#13;
executives may need to travel abroad for identifying buyers and suppliers and for obtaining&#13;
information about standards, distribution channels, competition and other market/buver&#13;
specific information. Travel may also be necessary for negotiating agreements with buyers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
and suppliers or participating in trade fairs. Such export market development related&#13;
activities will be eligible for support under the ESF.&#13;
* Travel to Armenia by Potential Buyers. Before forming long-termn relationships with&#13;
Armenian exporters, overseas buyers will wish to inspect the production facilities/supply&#13;
sources in Armenia in order to gain first-hand knowledge about the Armenian firms. In most&#13;
instances it will be in the interest of Armenian firms to arrange such visits. If necessary,&#13;
under the ESF, assistance will be provided for meeting the cost of such visits.&#13;
* Product Certifi cation. In many cases, before placing orders overseas buyers will wish to&#13;
establish the quality of the products or the manufacturing process. Buyers may also wish to&#13;
ascertain in advance quality assurance procedures employed by Armenian firms. Armenian&#13;
firms can employ a number of strategies for assuring overseas buyers about product quality.&#13;
These can range from product certification by international inspection agencies, certification&#13;
under ISO 9000 standards, certification under specific national standards, certification by&#13;
buyer's inspection and quality assurance unit, etc. The Fund will provide financial&#13;
assistance to Armenian firms in hiring specialized help in developing and implementing&#13;
quality assurance and product certification strategies including purchase of testing&#13;
equipment.&#13;
Productivity Enhancement. In order to compete effectively, many Armenian firms may need&#13;
to reduce costs and improve quality. This may require specialized support aimed at&#13;
identifying and eliminating production and process deficiencies, equipment and raw material&#13;
bottlenecks, material wastage's, storage and handling problems etc. The ESF will assist&#13;
firms in utilizing expert diagnostic services and advice with a view to reducing costs of&#13;
production, packaging, transportation and distribution.&#13;
* Product Launch and Promotion. In many instances firms will have to test-market their&#13;
products. Armenian firms may also have to incur advertising and publicity costs.&#13;
Establishing distribution channels may also entail start-up costs. The Fund will support&#13;
Armenian firms in meeting the start-up costs associated with product launch and initial&#13;
product promotion.&#13;
* Training. Most Armenian enterprises have limited experience in organizing for exports. In-&#13;
house experience and capacity to undertake export market analysis, prepare and develop&#13;
marketing strategies, and undertake actual marketing and selling is limited. The fund will&#13;
provide assistance to firms in training their executives in market research and marketing,&#13;
organizing export marketing departments and training staff working in these departments.&#13;
Such training will also include training in accounting, costing and financial management.&#13;
* Development of Domestic Consulting Industry and Supply Services. A number of potential&#13;
domestic suppliers of information and specialized consulting services are emerging.&#13;
However, their capabilities are limited and weak. The Department of standards is also&#13;
attempting to strengthen the MSTQ (Metrology, Standards, Testing and Quality)&#13;
infrastructure. Strengthening domestic capabilities in these areas is vital for bringing down&#13;
the costs of exporter support services and in making them more readily accessible.&#13;
Therefore, the ESF will assist private Armenian firms who wish to become suppliers of&#13;
specialized export support services. In addition, the Fund could also provide assistance to&#13;
the Department of Standards in collecting and disseminating information on standards and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
quality assurance, in providing calibration services, in accrediting private testing and&#13;
certification laboratories and in developing their legal metrology functions relating to health,&#13;
safety and environment. In all instances assistance will be based on well structured plans.&#13;
B. Match Making&#13;
8.    Under the Match Making assistance, enterprises would receive grant support in hiring&#13;
international brokers for locating strategic partners for the following purposes:&#13;
*  Contract Manufacturing where the foreign partner provides working capital in the form&#13;
of raw materials and sometimes cash and off takes the production while paying the&#13;
enterprise for the manufacturing time.&#13;
*  Technology Transfer where the foreign partner put in equipment or technology and&#13;
sometimes working capital and receives a share of the equity, profits, or production in&#13;
return.&#13;
e  Fixed Capital Investment to upgrade and rehabilitate existing plant to bring it into&#13;
compliance with foreign market needs so as to enable the partner to obtain a return&#13;
through sales of the upgraded product for its own uses or in its own markets.&#13;
e Plant Completion and Buyouts where the foreign partner would complete an unfinished&#13;
plant at some fraction of the greenfield cost and then operate it as an owner or&#13;
shareholder to benefit from the resulting higher returns. There are numerous such&#13;
opportunities in Armenia where with the dissolution of the FSU many modern plant&#13;
constructions came to a halt.&#13;
9.     The term investment is used to denote all of these different types of fixed and working&#13;
capital investments as well as the more conventional direct foreign investment generally&#13;
associated with greenfield projects or joint ventures.&#13;
10.   The matchmaking services needed would include not only the search for appropriate&#13;
opportunistic and strategic investment partners but also assistance in properly presenting the&#13;
Armenian investment opportunities in order to attract the potential foreign investors to Armenia.&#13;
This would involve preparing a project proposal or offering document for the enterprise and then&#13;
trying to find strategic or other investors who might be interested in the opportunity presented by&#13;
the enterprise. Once the potential partner has been located, they would have to be brought&#13;
together with the enterprise and kept together until the deal is consummated. Thus the services&#13;
of the intermediaries would also include assistance in the negotiation and contract process,&#13;
keeping the deal together during the due diligence process all the way to closing and subsequent&#13;
follow up during the implementation phase.&#13;
Level of Grant Support&#13;
11.   The level of grant support to be extended under the ESF would be as follows:&#13;
(a) Export Market Development: The ESF would finance up to 80% or a maximum of&#13;
US$ 100,000, of the cost of eligible export market development activities. ESF assistance to&#13;
Armenian enterprises would be on a grant basis with no repayment obligations. However, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
firms would have to meet the remaining percent cost of eligible activities from their own&#13;
resources, which would be payable to the ESF for onward transmission to the Project&#13;
Management Unit. The percentage co-payment by the beneficiary enterprises would be laid out&#13;
in the operating manual of the ESF.&#13;
(b) Match Making: Subject to the upper limit of $100,000, the amount of assistance&#13;
under the ESF would be graduated to the size of the fees charged by the intermediary match&#13;
maker, in the range 40 to 80%, as laid down in the operating manual of the ESF.&#13;
12.   Authority to Approve Grants. Grants less than US$25,000 will be jointly approved by&#13;
the Executive Director, EDIPA and the Fund Manager. In the event of disagreement the&#13;
approval would be referred to the Grant Approval Committee (GAC). Grants in excess of&#13;
US$25,000 will be approved by the GAC.&#13;
Management of the Fund&#13;
13.   The ESF would be supervised by the GAC, to be established by the Ministry of&#13;
Economy. The fund would be located in the Enterprise Development and Foreign Investment&#13;
Promotion Agency (EDIPA) and would be under the control of the Director, EDIPA. EDIPA&#13;
would provide the necessary administrative services to the ESF. The day-to-day management of&#13;
the fimd would be through a Fund Manager who would report to the Director, EDIPA.&#13;
14.   Grants Approval Committee (GAC). This would be a supervisory committee established&#13;
by the Ministry of Economy to monitor the implementation of the ESF Program. This&#13;
committee would be chaired by the Minister of Economy or equivalent of ministerial rank, and&#13;
would consist of one representative each from the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance and&#13;
the National Bank of Armenia. It would also have three representatives from the private sector&#13;
with at least one representative from the commercial banks. The chairman would have the power&#13;
to convene meetings or alternatively ask for no-objections from members. The GAC would have&#13;
the following functions: (a) approval of ESF Program Policies and Procedures; (b) overall&#13;
supervision of the ESF program; and (c) approval of grants in excess of US$25,000. Grants&#13;
below US$25,000 would normally be jointly approved by the Executive Director of EDIPA and&#13;
the Fund Manager; in the case of disagreements these would also be referred to the GAC, along&#13;
with all other applications. The first three grants submitted for approval to the GAC would be&#13;
forwarded to IDA for prior clearance.&#13;
15.   Staffing. Successful program implementation would require specialized knowledge,&#13;
about overseas markets, buyer needs, the consulting profession and experience in dealing with&#13;
firms, consultants and international brokers. For the first two years of the Fund's operations,&#13;
EDIPA would recruit, internationally, a Fund Manager to administer the Fund. The Fund&#13;
Manager would market the ESF facility, develop detailed eligibility criteria, process grant&#13;
requests from firms, recommend and approve grant requests, assist firms in preparing grant&#13;
proposals, identify the specialized services required by firms, monitor activities financed under&#13;
the ESF, and evaluate outcomes under the ESF program. The Fund manager would report to the&#13;
Director, EDIPA. To ensure sustainability of the exporter support program, two local fund&#13;
managers would also be hired to work along with the Foreign Fund Manager. One Local Fund&#13;
Manager would be responsible for the export market development program and the other would&#13;
be responsible for the Match Making Facility. The Foreign Fund Manager would train the local&#13;
Fund Managers so that management of the ESF could be handed over to these Local Fund&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
Managers during the third year of project implementation. (In the last year of the Fund's&#13;
operations the Foreign Fund Manager would function as a part-time advisor with a total time&#13;
commitment of 60 days spread throughout the year). In addition, two Marketing Officers would&#13;
be locally recruited to assist in management of the ESF. To ensure effective launch of the&#13;
Matchmaking Program, EDIPA would also utilize three short term consultants to assist in the&#13;
preparation of the facility, drafting the policies and procedures for the matchmaking program,&#13;
preparing a list of intermediaries by country, sector and specialization, and preparing the&#13;
program contracts to be used by Armenian enterprises while entering into agreements with the&#13;
matchmaking intermediaries. The terms of reference for the Director, EDIPA; Foreign Fund&#13;
Manager, Local Fund Managers, and specialist consultants are available in the project files.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
16.   Implementation Plan and Manual. Before commencement of operations, EDIPA would&#13;
prepare an implementation plan and a manual that would include administrative and operating&#13;
budgets, marketing and communication strategy for the ESF, identification of prospective&#13;
beneficiaries and service suppliers, procedures for processing grant requests including&#13;
standardization of application forms, reporting format, monitoring procedures, payment&#13;
procedures, and safeguards for maintaining the confidentiality of all information supplied by&#13;
firms and consultants. The implementation plan and manual would be approved by the GAC&#13;
before program launch.&#13;
17.   Procurement Procedures. Procurement will be handled by the Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU) in the Ministry of Economy. EDIPA will prepare all procurement requests for goods and&#13;
services and forward them to PMU. The value of goods proposed to be financed under each&#13;
grant proposal would be small. Hence, these would be procured under contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of sound commercial practices. Consulting services would be procured in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers.&#13;
18.   Disbursements. Disbursements under the ESF would be handled by the Project&#13;
Management Unit. PMU would open and maintain a Special Account that would be used to&#13;
disburse IDA (ITF) funds under the ESF Program. Since enterprises will make co-payments on&#13;
activities financed under the ESF, the PMU will also open a local account into which the&#13;
enterprise's beneficiary's share of payment will be deposited by the EDIPA. At the time of&#13;
approving each grant proposal, EDIPA would notify the PMU. When payments for goods and&#13;
services have to be made under an approved grant proposal, EDIPA would request the PMU to&#13;
make the necessary disbursements. At the time of making this request, EDIPA would transfer&#13;
the enterprise's share of the payment to the PMU. PMU will make payments by drawing on the&#13;
Special Account for up to the amount eligible for funding under the ESF and the balance will be&#13;
drawn from the Local Currency Account.&#13;
19.   Accounting, Auditing and Reporting. EDIPA would establish and maintain separate&#13;
ESF project related accounts. These accounts would be audited annually by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audited accounts would be submitted to the PMU not later&#13;
than three months from the end of each fiscal year. PMU would forward the accounts to the&#13;
Bank. EDIPA would submit monthly progress reports to the GAC for review and approval.&#13;
After approval by the GAC, EDIPA would forward these reports to PMU who in turn would&#13;
forward them to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
20.   Monitoring and Supervision. EDIPA would receive and assist Bank supervision&#13;
missions and would provide all information sought by the Bank. Annual joint review of the&#13;
program would be undertaken with the Bank. At the end of the program, EDIPA would prepare&#13;
a project completion report for the Bank.&#13;

ARMENIA&#13;
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Analysis of Bank Profiles&#13;
1.    Annex A (attached) summarizes the situation in all Armenian banks which were in&#13;
operation in August 1995. Even though the data are based on accounts which are unadjusted&#13;
for the distortions of Soviet-style accounting and are also un-audited, they broadly confirm the&#13;
small size of most of the banks both in terms of capital, total loans, and total assets.&#13;
2.    Audits of 30 of the banks conducted between April and July 1996 as part of the&#13;
preparation for this project indicate that some of these, with appropriate technical&#13;
strengthening could have prospects of growing into sound banks with the potential for&#13;
channeling significant volumes of credit.&#13;
3.    The audit reports have been evaluated according to the eligibility requirements for&#13;
banks under the credit line component of the project. The main requirements are:&#13;
*  compliance with the CBA minimum capital requirement ($350,000 by January 1, 1997);&#13;
* proper loan-loss provisioning in accordance with international standards;&#13;
*  a minimum 4 % BIS risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio;&#13;
*  exposure to any one entity of no more than 30% of equity capital and aggregate&#13;
exposure to insiders of no more than 100% of equity capital by January 1, 1997.&#13;
4.    The five banks closest to complying with all of the requirements on the basis of the&#13;
information so far available are Gladzor, Prometheus, Midland Armenia, Converse, and&#13;
David.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
Converse, Prometheus, Gladzor and David are among the best banks in the system from this&#13;
point of view having already achieved 57%, 47%, 35%, and 33% respectively of the total&#13;
provisions they will need at the end of the three year transition period. Midland Armenia as a&#13;
very new bank presently has almost no classified loans and so has little need for provisions.&#13;
The average bank has achieved about 25% of the required total provisioning while the worse&#13;
performers in this regard have achieved only I or 2 % of the requirement. Bank supervisors&#13;
expect that the average figure will rise to 50 percent by end-1996.&#13;
On other matters, the audit report on Gladzor Bank indicates that the bank needs to&#13;
accumulate additional capital and also to improve loan quality. The management team is fairly&#13;
good except the need to improve lending procedures. The bank is wholly owned by a small&#13;
number of private shareholders and has a loan portfolio which has now grown to over&#13;
$300,000 spread over some 50 borrowers in diversified sectors such as construction, textiles,&#13;
agrobusinesss, and trade. This compares with total assets of about $500,000. The bank is&#13;
tightly managed with a small staff and no branch network. Its pipeline is quite small but it&#13;
could probably double the existing volume of outstanding loans with few difficulties provided&#13;
that the extra capital required could be raised.&#13;
The David Bank is a very similar size to Gladzor. Audit details are awaited on this bank.&#13;
The audit report on Prometheus Bank indicates that the bank's capital, asset quality, earnings&#13;
and liquidity are all relatively strong. Its total assets are in excess of $400,000 about half of&#13;
which is in the loan portfolio. The management of the bank is conservative but also needs to&#13;
make improvements in its procedures for loan approval and administration. The rate of return&#13;
on assets in the recent past has been low but this is accounted for by the conservative&#13;
provisioning policy adopted by management. The underlying earnings of the bank are good.&#13;
The bank is in good standing with prudential requirements except for the fact that one of its&#13;
largest loans - to a local shoe factory- marginally exceeds the maximum 35% of capital&#13;
allowed for a single exposure. This will be corrected readily enough when the bank increases&#13;
its capital.&#13;
The Lend Bank is a fourth wholly private bank. It is sponsored by some 16 individual&#13;
shareholders. It has total assets of about $1.3 million and loans outstanding of almost&#13;
$700,000. Its loans have gone to some 20 main customers with only about 10 percent of the&#13;
current outstandings being to state enterprises. The bank has three branches but two of these&#13;
are in Yerevan where the bank also operates a number of currency exchange offices which&#13;
yield a substantial non-interest income.&#13;
The Midland Armenia Bank which was established only ion March 1996, has moved rapidly&#13;
to attract a relatively large volume of deposits and is already larger than the multi-branched&#13;
Savings Bank from this point of view. As a very well capitalized bank with major support&#13;
from its London-based shareholders it clearly has the capacity and the management skills to&#13;
play a significant part in the channeling of the credit line should it choose to do so. However,&#13;
as a very new bank it so far has no track record in terms of lending activities and will be&#13;
cautious in building up its portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
The Converse Bank is much smaller than the other banks identified as leading contenders for&#13;
credit line participation. Its total assets amount to $300,000 with total loans outstanding of less&#13;
than $100,000. Again the detailed audit report is awaited.&#13;
Further analysis is likely to identify other banks with potential for participation in the credit&#13;
line. In particular, no audit report is yet available for Armimpexbank - one of the former&#13;
state-owned banks. However, the information available suggests that this bank is not only&#13;
larger than most of the other banks identified but also well on the way to upgrading its&#13;
management systems and overall financial strength.&#13;
Although this bank still has a GOA shareholding (16 percent) and some SOE shareholding, it&#13;
also has an influential foreign shareholder who currently accounts for 35% of the total capital.&#13;
With the financial strengthening which this external influence has encouraged, the bank has&#13;
already been able to raise its capital to $540,000 (October 1995) and expects a further increase&#13;
to $2.5 million by end- 1996. The bank of its own volition has commissioned an external (IAS)&#13;
diagnostic study and has begun to work on the management improvements which that study&#13;
has revealed as necessary. Although its existing portfolio is suspect with over 25% of loans&#13;
past due, and its activities still closely tied in with state enterprises, its management and&#13;
capacity to raise additional capital give it reasonable prospects for the longer term. It has also&#13;
provided the Bank with information on a pipeline of subprojects amounting in total to more&#13;
than $10 million of which a large part are in the private sector. It is already acting as the&#13;
channel for a $1 million of small scale lending (maximum project size, $50,000) from the&#13;
Eurasia Foundation.&#13;
Credit Yerevan is a second bank which still has links to state activity but which is nonetheless&#13;
a possible participant in the credit line. This bank has close ownership and business links with&#13;
the City of Yerevan. Five of its main shareholders are agencies of the city administration and&#13;
three other shareholders are state-owned enterprises. However, 64 percent of shares are owned&#13;
by individuals with the Chairman himself being a significant shareholder. Although the bank&#13;
appears to operate with a degree of independence from its state-owned shareholders, it is&#13;
dependent on these for a substantial part of its present resourcing. This renders it vulnerable to&#13;
political decisions which could relocate these balances. Year-end 1995 accounts indicate total&#13;
loans outstanding in excess of $1 million (a 170 percent reverse on 1994); and a total balance&#13;
sheet of $2.7 million). Shareholders equity including retained earnings amounted to $320,000.&#13;
However, the audit report on this bank indicates a number of problems which will need to be&#13;
resolved. In particular, the capital of the bank has proved insufficient to absorb recent losses&#13;
on trading in privatization certificates and loans, and the loan loss reserve is funded only to the&#13;
extent of 6% of classified loans. Earnings have been harmed by recent large investments in the&#13;
bank's own premises and are inadequate to assist the build up of capital. At the same time, the&#13;
positive earning ratios in past allow a possibility of internal recapitalization when non-&#13;
recurring expenses stop. The management of the bank seems to be progressive and fair,&#13;
though the lending procedures need improvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
At least one other of the former State banks, Ardshinbank, has indicated interest in credit line&#13;
participation. This is the largest bank in the system in terms of assets but is likely to be the&#13;
most severely impaired in terms of asset quality, because of its history of lending to state&#13;
enterprises. Hence more detailed analysis of the bank will be undertaken once audit reports are&#13;
available.&#13;
Finally, a new regional bank, Shirak Investments, was established in the earthquake zone of&#13;
Armenia in March 1996. Its sponsors anticipate that it will build up to have US$600,000 of&#13;
capital by 1997. This could be an additional serious contender for credit line participation.&#13;

ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Line of Credit to Commercial Banks&#13;
Draft Operating Policies and Procedures&#13;
The following procedures, to be incorporated in an operations manual, are to be followed&#13;
in granting credit:&#13;
-  The beneficiary enterprise(BE) will present the subproject and the respective financing&#13;
application to the participating financial institution (PFI) on the forms prepared by the&#13;
PFI which will analyze the project.&#13;
- If the financing application is approved by the PFI, and provided that the subproject&#13;
satisfies the evaluation criteria referred to in the Attachment, the PFI will submit the&#13;
following documents to the PMU:&#13;
-  an evaluation report prepared in accordance with the requirements in the&#13;
Attachment, accompanied by the file on the financing application presented by&#13;
the BE; and&#13;
-  a refinance request for the operation filed on the form established in the&#13;
Attachment.&#13;
- The PMU will determine whether the subproject presented is eligible, and, within a&#13;
reasonable period (which should not exceed 10 working days), whether all established&#13;
criteria have been met. The PMU will:&#13;
-  approve the refinance request submitted by the PFI, provided that the import&#13;
component of the investment project is equal to US$150,000 or less;&#13;
-  prepare a report on its determination regarding the documents presented,&#13;
provided that the subloan requirement for the investment project is equal to or&#13;
greater than US$150,000, and submit the file for a decision by the World Bank.&#13;
-  In addition, the first three subprojects presented by each PFI to the PMU must be&#13;
authorized by the World Bank, following presentation of the respective files, including&#13;
the appraisal report.&#13;
-  The PFI will enter a subloan agreement with the BE immediately after having been&#13;
informed by the PMU of the approval of the refinance request, and this will initiate&#13;
execution of the subproject.&#13;
-  The PFI must present-through the PMU-upon irrevocable refinance by the MOE, the&#13;
legal documentation relating to the debts owed by the BE, within a period of no more&#13;
than 10 days after the loan takes effect.&#13;
&#13;

II.    With regard to the procedures to be followed for utilization of the IDA (ITF) Line of&#13;
Credit for fnancing the investment project, the following steps are to be followed:&#13;
-  On behalf of the BE, the PFI will present to the PMU of the MOE, a request for payment&#13;
abroad or a transfer to the beneficiary of the funds delivered.&#13;
-  The PFI must certify that:&#13;
- the operation is provided for and approved in the respective subproject;&#13;
- applicable regulations were followed in the respective procurement; and&#13;
- all the elements necessary for execution of the order for payment or transfer are&#13;
included in the respective files.&#13;
- The request referred to must be accompanied by the following documents:&#13;
-   bill or proforma invoice, depending on whether the supplies have been&#13;
delivered or not;&#13;
- a statement of the number of the joint MOE/PFI account in which the entries are&#13;
made for expenditures of the operation and the amount of the payments abroad&#13;
or transfers of funds delivered.&#13;
-  The PMU will transmit to the PFI the records of entries and negotiating documents&#13;
regarding the execution of the operations, and the PFI must inform the BE for this&#13;
