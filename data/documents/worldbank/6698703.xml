            Postconflict countries have had
            difficulty attracting private investment in infrastructure,
            and their growth and stability have suffered as a result.
            But the success of a few countries hints at policy
            initiatives that governments could pursue to close this
            destabilizing gap in investment. The emphasis should be on
            making sure that sector reforms go far enough, getting the
            timing and sequencing of the reforms right, reducing
            investor risk, and recognizing the importance of small-scale providers.
