1. BACKGROUND&#13;
MACROECONOMIC SETTING&#13;
1.1   Ranked on the basis of Gross National Product (GNP) per capita, Malawi&#13;
(US$140 in 1994) is the ninth poorest country in the world. Ninety percent of its&#13;
population lives in rural areas and depends mainly on subsistence agriculture for&#13;
livelihood. Of total arable land, 40 percent is held in the estate sector which mostly&#13;
produces export crops, mainly tobacco, sugar, tea and coffee. The remaining area is&#13;
shared by 1.8 million smallholder households. More than 40 percent of these cultivate&#13;
less than 0.5 hectares. Land constraint in the smallholder sector is daunting and is a&#13;
major factor in rural poverty. In addition to having a poor resource base, with agriculture&#13;
being the mainstay, Malawi's average population density of 106 persons per km is one of&#13;
the highest in Africa.&#13;
1.2   Since it attained independence in 1964, Malawi emphasized maintaining&#13;
macroeconomic stability and growth of infrastructure and estate agriculture as the main&#13;
elements of its development strategy. Poverty was to be dealt with by "trickle-down&#13;
effects". This strategy proved effective initially in promoting growth and macroeconomic&#13;
stability, but did very little to reduce poverty. During the 1960s and 1970s, the real Gross&#13;
Domestic Product (GDP) more than doubled and per capita income increased by 3&#13;
percent a year. However, since structural weaknesses persisted and the economic base&#13;
remained narrow--tobacco continued to be the dominating produce, accounting for 70&#13;
percent of foreign exchange earnings--the economy remained highly vulnerable to&#13;
external and internal shocks. Much of the growth momentum was lost in the mid-1980s&#13;
when a series of destabilizing factors came into play. The problem began with declining&#13;
tobacco prices in the international market, and civil strife in Mozambique, which&#13;
increased international transport costs and brought large refugee and security-related&#13;
expenditures. The drought of 1992 caused the economy to contract by 8 percent,&#13;
reducing the smallholder output by 37.4 percent. This was followed by another drought&#13;
in 1994 when the economy contracted by 12 percent and the production of maize, the&#13;
main staple, fell by about 50 percent. Government expenditures continued to rise, adding&#13;
to the instability. These factors created serious macroeconomic instability and brought to&#13;
the fore inherent structural weaknesses of the economy, shown by the sharp depreciation&#13;
of the exchange rate, high inflation (35 percent in 1994), widespread poverty and food&#13;
insecurity.&#13;
1.3   Against this background, stabilization and poverty reduction have emerged as&#13;
central objectives of economic management. These are also the objectives of the Country&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Malawi. Strengthening the nexus between growth and&#13;
poverty reduction is the main emphasis of the strategy. Poverty-targeted investment and&#13;
development of human resources, together with programs of macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization, fiscal restructuring and deregulation, private sector-led growth, particularly&#13;
in agriculture, and capacity building and decentralization, are important elements of the&#13;
strategy. The new Government (GOM) has shown strong commitment towards these&#13;
objectives. It has adopted firm remedial measures and the macroeconomic situation,&#13;
though still fragile, has improved. The introduction of cash budgeting and measures to&#13;
track public expenditure, such as the Medium Term Expenditure Framework as&#13;
instruments to improve expenditure control, have contributed to lowering public&#13;
expenditures significantly. New revenue measures and improved monetary management&#13;
have further contributed towards fiscal balance. While fiscal and monetary restraints&#13;
have succeeded in reducing the rate of inflation and stabilizing the exchange rate, the&#13;
sustainability of the adjustment process and economic growth will depend on continued&#13;
efforts toward restructuring incentives to: spur growth in output and export, limit&#13;
vulnerability to external shocks, increase private sector investment, control runaway&#13;
population growth, develop human resources, and adopt effective strategies to translate&#13;
economic growth into poverty reduction. Establishment of the Malawi Social Action&#13;
Fund (MASAF), under the oversight of the Ministry of Economic Planning and&#13;
Development (MEPD), is an important step towards achieving these objectives.&#13;
POVERTY IN MALAWI&#13;
1.4   Poverty in Malawi is pervasive and has several aspects. The country has low&#13;
average incomes which are distributed highly unequally; the poorest of society face acute&#13;
deprivation. A Poverty Profile' completed as part of MASAF preparation established that&#13;
the Gini coefficient for Malawi is 0.62, the highest for any African country with available&#13;
data. For the poorest 20 percent of households even the most basic food needs are not&#13;
fully met and are generally so pressing that families are at an irreducible minimum of&#13;
non-food consumption. The indicators of social sector development (Annex 1) are&#13;
similarly unfavorable for the nation as a whole and worse for the poor. Infant mortality&#13;
rate (134 per 1,000 live births), child malnutrition, stunting and wasting (48.7% and&#13;
5.4%), maternal mortality (620 per 100,000 births) and prevalence of disease including&#13;
the spread of Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency&#13;
Syndrome are very high compared even to other Sub- Saharan countries.&#13;
1.5   There is a significant rural-urban, geographical, and gender bias in the incidence&#13;
of poverty in the country; Table 1.1 shows the rural-urban distribution. Ninety-five per&#13;
cent of the total Malawian poverty gap is found in rural areas. Most of the poor, and&#13;
nearly all the core poor are among the smallholder households. Even among the poor&#13;

1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
households, inequality is significant. The bottom half of the smallholder households&#13;
receive only 15 percent of the income, while the top 10 percent receive 35 percent.&#13;

* Towns where district headquarters are located.&#13;
1.6    Regional variation of poverty is equally significant. The Southern Region which&#13;
is most populous and accounts for 51 percent of total households in the country, has a&#13;
higher share of poor households (66 percent). Some of the pockets of most severe&#13;
poverty and highest densities of the poor are found along the Mozambique border.&#13;
Poverty differential by gender is similarly significant. Female-headed households&#13;
(FHHs) have generally less income and a higher dependency ratio. Male-headed&#13;
households constitute 75 percent of all households in the country. Yet the chance of a&#13;
male-headed household being among the poorest 40 percent is only one in three while&#13;
that of a FHH being in this group is one in two. As can be seen from Table 1.2, rural&#13;
female-headed households also account for a much larger share in the national poverty&#13;
gap than their representation in the total population.&#13;

1.7   Household Food Insecurity. Looking at the sectoral dimensions of poverty, one&#13;
finds that food insecurity is a pressing problem for the poor. Most smallholder&#13;
households run out of food nearly four months before the next harvest. Labor demand in&#13;
rural areas is minimal, and farm income is the mainstay of the poor. Yet constraints to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
smallholder productivity continue, perpetuating poverty and hunger. The small size of&#13;
holdings and restrictive land laws which prevent pooling, poor quality of land&#13;
exacerbated by continued soil erosion, a conspicuous lack of irrigation making agriculture&#13;
vulnerable to the low and unreliable rainfall in the country, lack of agricultural equipment&#13;
and limited credit availability that prevents adoption of improved seeds and fertilizers--all&#13;
these have kept yields very low and farm outputs insufficient for basic food needs of the&#13;
poor. For many people in rural areas, coping mechanisms include partial hunger.&#13;
1.8   The level of off-farm rural incomes has been falling due to declining real wages&#13;
and slow growth in labor demand. The minimum wage, a good proxy for market wage in&#13;
rural areas, has declined consistently in real terms. The demand for ganyu (casual labor)&#13;
is growing much slower than the rate of population growth. A long run food security&#13;
strategy for Malawi would require improving both smallholder productivity and labor&#13;
demand in rural areas. In the short- and medium-terms, this would call for an effective&#13;
and well targeted safety net to mitigate seasonal and chronic poverty, while at the same&#13;
time contributing to long-term development goals.&#13;
SECTORAL ISSUES&#13;
1.9   Education. Malawi's education system is hampered by poor access, poor&#13;
infrastructure, high repetition and drop-out rates, and inequality. Approximately thirty&#13;
percent of boys and 47.9 percent of girls of school-going age do not enroll. In 1994 the&#13;
Government eliminated school fees for primary education to improve access. Malawian&#13;
households responded overwhelmingly with an increase in enrollment by 62 percent,&#13;
taking primary school rolls from 1.8 million to nearly 3 million. While this reflects&#13;
communities' priority for education, and GOM's commitment, it has overcrowded&#13;
classrooms. The Government has recruited an additional 22,980 teachers, but the school&#13;
system still has an enormous teachers' training need and an acute shortage of classrooms,&#13;
water and sanitation facilities, and teachers' houses. This increase in enrollment came&#13;
when the primary school infrastructure had become over-stretched. In 1992/93, for&#13;
instance, there were 103 students on average per classroom; this obviously obscured a&#13;
considerable regional variation, with some schools operating under acute constraints.&#13;
The latest shortage of classrooms is estimated at 38,000 units. A snapshot of the problem&#13;
is presented in Box 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Box 1: FIeld observations during the Pre-appraisal Mbslon&#13;
The mission visited two primary schools. One of them is a two-grade community school with a roll of&#13;
2,612 pupils. Only one of its 42 teachers isfully qualified There are only 6 roofed sheds with mud&#13;
floors, each accommodating at most 25 pupils. Practically all classes are held in the open and when it&#13;
rains the children are crammed into the sheds and those not accommodated seek shelter in the nearby&#13;
villages. Three standard I pupils were sharing a textbook. there were no booksfor standard 2 pupils.&#13;
The other is afiul primary school built to accommodate two streams in each of its 8 grades. This year&#13;
it has 6,042 pupils and a staff complement of 105 teachers, only 43 of whom are fully qualified The&#13;
headmaster, who appeared to be a first rate professional and manager, said that it was impossible to&#13;
educate pupils under these conditions. He said that the pupils should be divided into at least four&#13;
schools and that the three additional schools have to be carefully sited after a sound school mapping&#13;
analysis. On average 5 pupils were sharing a textbook Standards 3 and 4 had no textbooks. All the&#13;
school's pit latrines were flil and the headmaster was very concerned about the danger of an outbreak&#13;
of disease.&#13;
1.10   In recent years, serious efforts have been made to improve the share of education&#13;
in government expenditures. A greater emphasis has been placed on primary education.&#13;
The share of education improved from 11.1 percent in 1990/91 to 17.5 percent in&#13;
1993/94. Because of the policy shift in 1994/95, public recurrent spending on education&#13;
more than doubled in real terms between 1990/91 and 1994/95. In spite of these efforts,&#13;
enormous gaps still exist in quality and infriastructure at the primary level. As can be&#13;
seen from Table 1.3, primary education has long suffered from a skewed distribution of&#13;
sector resources which favor university, tertiary and secondary education. Even before&#13;
enrollment jumped in 1994, historical under-funding of infrastructure and supplies had&#13;
placed Malawi's primary public schools among the most poorly equipped in Africa.&#13;

1.11  To meet the extraordinary challenge of increased enrollments, GOM has&#13;
committed an additional MK73 million to the primary sector in the fiscal year 1995/96,&#13;
but this amount will mostly finance new teachers' salaries' The Government depends&#13;
largely on external funding for infrastructure improvement. The International&#13;
Development Association (IDA)-assisted Primary Education Project, to be approved in&#13;
1996, will build 2,000 classrooms as an urgent initiative. Building contractors have been&#13;
identified and the design selected. This will assist in alleviating the most pressing needs.&#13;
However, for an adequate and enduring solution, further investment in quality and in&#13;
building new classrooms, with greater community participation, is essential to improving&#13;
primary education.&#13;
1.12 Population and Health. In general, the health status of most Malawians is poor&#13;
and is worsening. Social and health indicators for Malawi (see Annex 1 for inter-country&#13;
comparison) continue to be low: life expectancy is 44/45 years; 50 percent of children are&#13;
about two standard deviations below expected height for age; the leading diseases;&#13;
malaria, respiratory infections, and abdominal and gastrointestinal tract disorders, have&#13;
not been contained. Acute infections (pneumonia and measles), cholera, diarrhea, and&#13;
chronic infections (especially tuberculosis) continue to be serious problems, while&#13;
sexually-transmitted diseases and Acquired Immune-Deficiency Syndrome are spreading&#13;
rapidly; Table 1.4 gives some indicators for 1992.&#13;

1.13 High levels of morbidity and mortality (see Annex 1) among infants, children and&#13;
mothers are the result of poor nutritional status, food insecurity, high prevalence of&#13;
preventable diseases, poor hygiene and sanitation, low access to health and social&#13;
services, and high illiteracy and fertility rates. These are manifestations of the poverty&#13;
condition of Malawi--more widespread and deeper in rural areas than in peri- and urban&#13;
areas. The mismatch, in the past, between the emphasis on curative, high technology&#13;
urban-based service provision and the predominant disease pattern characterized by&#13;
preventable (low cost), infectious, communicable and nutrition-related diseases&#13;
exacerbated the situation. Ongoing efforts under the IDA-assisted Population, Health and&#13;
Nutrition (PHN) Sector Credit have focused health policy and resource allocation in favor&#13;
of low cost, effective, preventive-promotive health measures targeted at the rural and&#13;
urban poor. The Ministry of Health and Population's (MOHP) Health Policy Framework&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
advocates, among other things, targeting resources to priorities identified by the&#13;
communities.&#13;
1.14 Constraints faced by Malawi with respect to PHN continue to be related to&#13;
physical infrastructure, goods and services and human resources. The poor distribution&#13;
and location and lack of health centers, inadequate staff housing, scarcity of potable&#13;
water, and unavailability of drugs and other support goods and services are constraints&#13;
that deter health staff from the periphery. Since the communities endure the burdens of&#13;
these inadequacies, the communities can well identify them--waiting mothers' shelters,&#13;
health centers, clinic dispensaries/maternity, staff housing, boreholes--as priorities for&#13;
funding from MASAF. Some activities which lend themselves to immediate funding&#13;
include: pit latrines, refuse disposal pits, clean water supply or drug revolving funds.&#13;
MOHP policy on facilities, staff deployment, drug supplies and commodities, and&#13;
standard designs will need to be sufficiently flexible to allow facilities to be constructed2&#13;
and drugs to be procured and sold by communities.&#13;
1.15 Water. The water resources in Malawi are abundant, yet the access to safe water&#13;
is as low as 53 percent (1991) of the population. Aside from the lakes and Shire River,&#13;
availability depends largely on the seasonal rainfall. Groundwater potential is currently&#13;
exploited for drinking purposes by 9,700 boreholes and 5,600 shallow wells. While the&#13;
present coverage is clearly low, an additional problem is inadequate maintenance and&#13;
repair. Recognizing these issues, GOM in May 1994 adopted a comprehensive Water&#13;
Resources Management Policy and Strategy which comprises policy reform and&#13;
institutional restructuring, and recommends transforming the organization and processes&#13;
for rural water supply to a more community-driven approach. The ongoing IDA-assisted&#13;
Water Project addresses the sector as a whole, with major emphasis on restructuring and&#13;
financing of urban water systems. Its coverage of rural water supply is limited.&#13;
Additional investment in rural water supply, promoted through community co-financing&#13;
and participation, is essential for the better health of the rural population.&#13;
1.16 Agriculture and Environment. Rural Malawi has limited scope for&#13;
smallholders to increase their incomes substantially through agriculture alone, given their&#13;
limited physical, human, and financial asset base. Smallholders are constrained by the&#13;
size of their land holdings, limited tools and equipment, and poor assets (such as&#13;
livestock) available for exchange to meet urgent food or investment needs. Since most&#13;
smallholders do not produce enough food or cash crops to achieve basic household food&#13;
requirements, it is critical to adopt policies, programs, and projects that improve and&#13;
enhance their endowments over time, while generating increased income and exchange&#13;
opportunities in the shorter term. The project could increase incomes in both the short-&#13;
and long-term and improve exchange opportunities by lowering transaction costs for poor&#13;
smallholders.&#13;
2  A simplified design for construction of health facilities under the Project has been agreed to.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
1.17 Infrastructure. Communication facilities in rural Malawi are minimal. Rural&#13;
transport is largely under-developed for lack of rural roads. Villagers have to walk long&#13;
distances to attend markets and health clinics. Women are known to carry headloads as&#13;
far as 30 kilometers in a day, and twice a week, for milling maize. Lack of transport&#13;
infrastructure places greater burdens on poor and remote communities. Public works&#13;
projects, targeting infrastructure improvements (roads, irrigation), would have the dual&#13;
benefit of increasing incomes in the short-term and helping increase the potential&#13;
agricultural production in the long-term by lowering production and marketing costs and&#13;
improving access to new technologies and services. These could also increase the overall&#13;
level of agricultural and non-agricultural activity in rural areas.&#13;
1 .18 Safety Nets: Drought and Public Works Program (PWP). Incomes in rural&#13;
Malawi are so low that most households are very vulnerable to shocks, in the economy&#13;
and in the weather. This is illustrated by the sharp devaluation and fiscal restraint&#13;
undertaken during 1994 which brought about two kinds of difficulties for the poor. High&#13;
inflation together with demand contraction, led to a decline of real wages for unskilled&#13;
workers--and for other salaried income groups--and loss of employment. It also increased&#13;
agricultural input costs for most smallholders who are net buyers of food grains. Drought&#13;
compounded the problem. This situation calls for an effective safety net for the poor;&#13;
existing poverty-oriented programs which are mostly credit-based, have only limited&#13;
coverage. Their impact is marginal because of low coverage, high administrative costs,&#13;
marketing constraints and poor targeting. Labor-intensive public works, which would&#13;
normally be appropriate, are all but non-existent. A well-targeted public works program&#13;
could be an important option for a safety net operation, mitigating temporary hardships&#13;
and contributing to long-term development. For example, improved natural resource&#13;
management achieved through planting vegetative cover (trees and grasses), terracing,&#13;
and water harvesting, all highly labor-intensive activities, can have significant public and&#13;
private benefits.&#13;
1.19  To enable the rural poor to fully participate and share in the potential benefits&#13;
from market liberalization, the pump of the rural economy needs to be primed. Some of&#13;
this will come from the liberalization of agricultural product and factor markets.&#13;
However, because of their low asset base, the rural poor would be worse off if paying&#13;
higher prices for food and basic necessities, and lacking new employment and income-&#13;
generating opportunities. Public Works Program would provide supplemental income&#13;
with which poor households can choose to buy food, or inputs to produce more food or&#13;
cash crops, or to finance cash outlays for non-food basic needs (such as health and&#13;
education costs).&#13;
PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
1.20 Poverty is clearly widespread and severe in Malawi and the condition of human&#13;
resources is dismal. The incomes of most rural Malawians are not sufficient to meet their&#13;
minimal needs, and health and education indicators are among the worst in the world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Past reliance on a growth strategy that did not lay sufficient stress on strengthening the&#13;
human resource base, and the over-centralized development administration that failed to&#13;
elicit wider non-governmental participation, have contributed most to the present&#13;
situation. Recognizing the situation and the constraints, the Government has made&#13;
sustainable poverty reduction its central objective. This project constitutes an important&#13;
step towards ameliorating the current poverty in the country. The project is a vital&#13;
component of the CAS, and complements other IDA-supported investment projects and&#13;
long-term growth objectives while creating additional productive employment in rural&#13;
areas. The Project addresses three most critical poverty concerns.&#13;
1.21  First, it allocates resources for programs targeted at the poor. Investment in&#13;
education, health and nutrition for the poor is essential for sustainable poverty reduction.&#13;
We have seen that the quality of primary education, which was already poor, has declined&#13;
critically. The gap in the provision of classrooms is so huge that the construction of&#13;
2,000 classrooms will meet only a part of the most pressing needs. Further construction&#13;
of classrooms and teachers' houses, taking people's priorities and participation into&#13;
account, will be necessary for attaining a reasonable quality standard. Similarly,&#13;
investment in health and water infrastructure is critical for reasonable access to these&#13;
facilities by the poor. An even more urgent need is to create an effective safety net for&#13;
the poor. Hunger and deprivation of the kind prevalent in Malawi impair the ability to&#13;
take advantage of available opportunities. Short-term income transfer schemes, such as&#13;
public works, can provide off-farm employment and increase incomes. These schemes&#13;
can also be consistent with long-run growth objectives such as improving rural&#13;
communication, irrigation, water supply, afforestation and rural markets.&#13;
1.22  Second, the project seeks to promote a new approach to development by involving&#13;
communities in project selection, preparation and implementation, while encouraging&#13;
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private institutions and government agencies to&#13;
provide facilitation where needed. GOM's "top-down" style of management and over-&#13;
centralized administration created significant hurdles to managing development&#13;
programs, and these institutional constraints are exacerbated by severe capacity&#13;
limitations within Government. Even where communities were able to mobilize their&#13;
own contribution and seek Government support and partnership, timely response with the&#13;
necessary financial and technical assistance has been lacking. Increasing participation of&#13;
communities and the civil society in the planning and management of community level&#13;
projects and adopting "bottom-up" processes are now recognized as essential elements of&#13;
the new development campaign. Acknowledging that all community needs, even the&#13;
most urgent ones, cannot be met all at once, priorities will have to be chosen and this can&#13;
be most credibly done by communities themselves. Community participation in&#13;
identification, preparation and financing will improve prioritization and efficiency in the&#13;
use of resources. As systematic client consultation undertaken during project preparation&#13;
has shown, communities are capable of and willing to co-finance activities and&#13;
implement them. In cases where facilitation is needed, the project allows communities to&#13;
decide whether and when they need a facilitator, and who they wish to work with. The&#13;
project itself works largely as a funding mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
1.23  Third, the project allocates resources to strengthen monitoring and assessment of&#13;
poverty in the country. It builds on the process started at MEPD to coordinate efforts to&#13;
monitor poverty and to improve data collection and analysis. It will continue efforts to&#13;
analyze household data to inform policy priorities initiated by the recently completed&#13;
Profile of Human Resources and Poverty. By bridging the poverty data gap and&#13;
developing analytical skills in Government and private institutions, the project would&#13;
help inform policy makers and other stakeholders about emerging poverty problems and&#13;
the strategies required to deal with them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
2. THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
OBJECTIVES AND SUMMARY&#13;
2.1   Objectives. Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF) will contribute towards&#13;
poverty reduction in four fundamental ways. Eirq, it will provide additional resources for&#13;
programs targeted at the poor, that is, fund the creation of village level assets which will&#13;
be directly beneficial to the poor through investments in primary education, peripheral&#13;
health services, and safe water. Second, it will promote a new approach to rural&#13;
development by involving communities in project preparation and implementation, while&#13;
encouraging government agencies, NGOs and private institutions to assist communities&#13;
when needed. The Project processes will empower communities by creating opportunities&#13;
for commriunities to revive the spirit of self help, enabling them to take control ever, and be&#13;
accountable for, their own development. Third, it will support a district level program of&#13;
labor-intensive construction to be targeted at the poorest districts as a safety net&#13;
operation. To these ends, the project will support the operation of a small autonomous&#13;
MASAF Management Unit (MU) that will appraise, finance and monitor implementation&#13;
of the project. Fourth. it will strengthen the poverty monitoring and assessment system&#13;
through financing a Poverty Monitoring Support Facility (PMSF). The PMSF&#13;
component will support poverty reduction policies and programs by bridging poverty-&#13;
related data gaps and developing analytical skills in government and private institutions.&#13;
2.2   Summary Description. The project has the following three components:&#13;
(a)   Community Subprojects - CSPs (71 percent) will finance activities&#13;
identified, prepared and implemented by the communities with or without&#13;
assistance from facilitators who may be government officials, NGOs,&#13;
private organizations or individuals; this includes an institutional&#13;
support sub-component (3 percent) that will ensure appraisal and&#13;
supervisory support by financing the MU staff, field offices,&#13;
transportation, equipment and operational costs. The component will&#13;
finance an information, education and communication (IEC) campaign to&#13;
inform communities and other participants about the demand-driven&#13;
processes of the project.&#13;
(b)   Public Works Program - PWP (27 percent) will finance a safety net&#13;
operation in poor and food-deficient areas through labor-intensive public&#13;
works constructing, rehabilitating and maintaining economic infrastructure.&#13;
These works will generate significant employment at the rural minimum&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
wage so as to operate as a safety net for those who have no alternative&#13;
income-earning opportunity. The wages will be paid in cash or a&#13;
combination of cash and food coupons.&#13;
(c)   Poverty Monitoring Support Facility - PMSF (2 percent) will finance&#13;
capacity building in institutions to coordinate, collect, analyze,&#13;
disseminate and use data relevant for poverty reduction policies and&#13;
programs.&#13;
DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PROCESSES&#13;
2.3   The project consists of three components: Community Subprojects, Pubiic Works&#13;
Program, and a Poverty Monitoring Support Facility, whose descriptions and processes&#13;
are detailed below.&#13;
Community Subprojects (Total US$50.34 million, IDA US$38.20 million)&#13;
2.4   The underlying principles and processes of this component are intended to ensure&#13;
that activities funded reflect the communities identified priority needs, and that the&#13;
communities lead in preparing and implementing these activities. Among the factors that&#13;
should contribute to the success of this component are: management autonomy of the&#13;
funding unit, flexibility of the rules governing the fund, speed of response to community&#13;
requests, community participation, and accountability for the funds. The MASAF&#13;
management structure, the line ministries and private organizations such as NGOs, will&#13;
facilitate the communities throughout the process. MASAF would ensure that the&#13;
proposals are appraised using pre-determined poverty-targeting criteria and national&#13;
sectoral norms (see paras 2.15 and 2.17), and that funding and supervision are adequately&#13;
arranged. Line ministries would ensure that activities chosen meet national priorities and&#13;
quality standards. Private and public field agencies would extend assistance to&#13;
communities on demand at various stages of the project. Community co-financing&#13;
through contribution is a prerequisite for funding to ensure community ownership and&#13;
true reflection of demand.&#13;
2.5   The MASAF structure operates under simple but accountable rules, autonomous&#13;
from regular Government procedures. Consistent with the multi-sectoral activities that&#13;
MASAF will promote, the apex of the MASAF structure is the Project Steering&#13;
Committee (PSC) comprising Principal Secretaries of relevant ministries and chaired by&#13;
Principal Secretary, MEPD. PSC approves all funding and functions as a 'Board' of the&#13;
MASAF; day-to-day management is carried out by the MASAF Manager (see paras 3.4-&#13;
3.16). Given the new institutions, roles and procedures involved, this component has&#13;
been piloted in 19 communities and lessons (see Annex 2 for summary of status) have&#13;
been incorporated into the project design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
2.6   Activities to be funded under this component will include:&#13;
*  upgrading and construction of community infrastructure in education, health,&#13;
water, and transport sectors, as well as building rural/urban markets,&#13;
community water points and granaries;&#13;
*  improving delivery of and access to social and economic services (that is, drug&#13;
supplies, desks, technical assistance, employment);&#13;
*  training to enhance grassroots technical and managerial capabilities and&#13;
attitudes towards self-managed development; and&#13;
*  initiatives to reorient and build capacities of the community development&#13;
facilitators (individual community members, extension officers, NGOs,&#13;
private sector and religious groups), to equip them with skills in participatory&#13;
planning and implementation in poverty alleviation.&#13;
2.7   The demand-driven nature of the component requires that the communities and all&#13;
other agents are well informed about the MASAF objectives, scope and processes. An&#13;
IEC campaign has been prepared and implemented at the piloting phase, and has been&#13;
designed as part of the mainstreamed project. The campaign will further focus on&#13;
sensitizing and training communities and support institutions (District Executive&#13;
Committees (DECs) and other community-based workers)). Using print and electronic&#13;
media such as booklets, logos, pamphlets, radio messages, the IEC campaign reaches&#13;
potential audiences including beneficiaries, politicians, policy makers, government field&#13;
staff, NGOs and private institutions. It provides information on key issues such as&#13;
selection criteria for activities, co-financing requirements and MASAF processes. During&#13;
the initial phase of piloting, it was learnt that there was insufficient and inaccurate&#13;
information about MASAF among the public at large. This led to incorrectly formulated&#13;
project applications which were subsequently rejected. It was therefore an important&#13;
lesson that an accurately targeted communication campaign is essential for: (a) assisting&#13;
district level sector officials and facilitators to understand their tasks and responsibilities,&#13;
and (b) informing communities about how MASAF can assist them. It became apparent&#13;
during the pilot phase that the electronic (radio) and print media would have limited&#13;
coverage in rural areas, and that emphasis on announcements at public gatherings would&#13;
be the most efficient mode of communication.&#13;
2.8   For the purposes of this Project, a community is a self-defining entity. It means a&#13;
group of households able to identify a demand that meets the selection criteria of this&#13;
Project. The size of a community that proposes a viable activity under the Project may&#13;
vary between and within urban and rural locations (see Box 2, and A Report on the&#13;
Research Findings of the SCC, located in the Project file).&#13;
&#13;

Box 2: Defining the Communiy&#13;
The operational unit of both MASAF and the SCC was the "community". During the field work it became&#13;
evident that definitions vawy between urban and rural areas. More importantly, within these geographic areas&#13;
the definition varies according to the subject of discussion.&#13;
In rural areas three different boundaries were defined in terms of legal/administrative, social and resource&#13;
characteristics. Legal/administrative boundaries are defined universally by the jurisdiction of the group&#13;
village headman who has responsibilityfor between 5 and 30 villages. In PRA mapping however the&#13;
"community" was defined by participants as a smaller unit; the village in the case of social maps and a&#13;
number of villages in terms of resources. The latter depends on geographic features such as catchment areas.&#13;
In urban areas, the picture is equally complex. The community is spatially defined in terms of the named&#13;
urban area. Urban communities used this spatial definition, but were conscious of theflux within communities&#13;
and, in particular socio-economic groups which at times form more cohesive groupings than the "community",&#13;
per se.&#13;
Implications for MASAF. It is clear that communities will be differently defined according to the projects&#13;
demanded. School projects for example might be expected to be submittedfrom a community as traditionally&#13;
defined within the chieftainship structure, while projects concerned with natural resource management would&#13;
logically use the resource-based definition of community. Given the demand-based nature of MSAF&#13;
projects, the community's own definition must be used.&#13;
2.9    With or without the assistance of facilitators (see Annex 6), the communities go&#13;
through the following steps in a typical project cycle, described in detail in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual (PIM) (see para 5.1 (a) and Annex 3): (a) identification, (b)&#13;
preparation, (c) appraisal, (d) approval, (e) implementation: procurement, disbursement,&#13;
and technical support/supervision, (f) monitoring, and evaluation, and (g) completion.&#13;
2.10   Identification. To ensure that activities selected (a) target poor communities, (b)&#13;
reflect sectoral priorities, (c) meet sectoral normns and standards, and (d) are sustainable,&#13;
selection criteria (see Annex 7) have been developed through community consultation.&#13;
The communities are informed about these criteria through the MASAF Orientation&#13;
Manual (document available in Project file.) and various IEC materials. The process of&#13;
identification and subsequent project activities are participatory to (a) ensure that weaker&#13;
groups in the community, such as women and youth, have adequate voice in project&#13;
decisions and activities, (b) promote transparency in project processes, and (c) guarantee&#13;
wider accountability and ownership for the project, promoted through community&#13;
contribution and commitment for maintenance.&#13;
2.11   The first step in the identification process is the convening of open meetings at the&#13;
community level, with balanced representation by gender, age and other categories, to&#13;
discuss their priority needs and problems. This meeting is convened by the traditional&#13;
authority (TA) who would have learned about the MASAF through the IEC campaign, or&#13;
is called by other community leaders, the MASAF Zone Office, Government field staff,&#13;
or private facilitators. In these meetings, the community decides whether to hire a&#13;
facilitator, and elects a Community Project Committee (CPC) (see para 3.9). The pilot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
has shown that the communities with better communication and higher literacy levels and&#13;
with a history of self-help tend to be quick in identifying and prioritizing their needs.&#13;
This underscores the need for facilitation for weaker communities. MASAF will provide&#13;
funding to NGOs, and suitable assistance such as fuel and maintenance to public agencies&#13;
(Community Development Assistants ) to arrange facilitation in areas where the demand&#13;
for community projects has lagged significantly. The pilot has shown that communities&#13;
give priority for social infrastructure such as schools, clinics and boreholes, and that on&#13;
average it took up to 12 weeks for communities to identify and agree on their priority&#13;
need3.&#13;
Box 3: Criteriafor Comnunuty Facilitation&#13;
Systematic client consultation findings show that more intensivefacilitation seems required in communities&#13;
where:&#13;
*  there is no extensive experience of indigenous organization or of working in partnership with an&#13;
NGO&#13;
*  there is no experience ofprevious, completedprojects&#13;
*  there is greater stratification and more extensive socio-economic variation&#13;
*  considerable power is wielded by dominant and influentialpersonalities&#13;
* authority and representation of views of women carries little weight.&#13;
SCCr  A Report on the Research Findings, May 1995&#13;
2.12   Preparation. Preparation of the community project is the responsibility of the&#13;
elected CPC. It involves providing simple information in a community application form&#13;
(see Annex 5), developed for the purpose, to allow verification during appraisal of&#13;
whether selection criteria are met, and that the process of identification followed is&#13;
consistent with participatory norms. The community application form filled in triplicate is&#13;
sent to the Zone Office and DEC. Information in the form provides the basis for&#13;
establishing the viability of the project, such as population size, income levels, distance&#13;
from a similar facility, other projects being implemented in the community and&#13;
community contribution. MASAF contribution to the individual project cost is not to&#13;
exceed US$100,000, unless approved by PSC and IDA. Information sought on the form&#13;
also relates to the project preparation process, such as the form of community&#13;
contribution, membership of the CPC, number of meetings held, representation of various&#13;
In Kazyozyo, Mchinji District, the community had indicated a dispensary unit as the agreed priority&#13;
until the day of the launch when it was evident from the women that a maternity unit was the priority.&#13;
In Chichewa, the local language, the word "Chipatala" could be construed to mean either facility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
community segments at meetings and the CPC. Communities are required to contribute&#13;
approximately 20 percent of the total project cost. Since the community may not be able&#13;
to evaluate their contribution precisely, valuation of their proposed contribution, typically&#13;
bricks, labor and local materials is made by the MU using market prices.&#13;
2.13 Technical specifications and the design options from which communities can&#13;
choose while preparing their own projects, are provided in the MASAF Orientation&#13;
Manual. Developing various options and allowing flexibility in the community choosing&#13;
a design is to maximize the use of local material and expertise while ensuring that the&#13;
quality standards are not compromised.&#13;
2.14 While preparation requirements are simple and can be met by the communities&#13;
without any external help, the communities are free to propose. The Systematic Client&#13;
Consultation showed that the communities would not want a facilitator imposed on them.&#13;
They would like the freedom to choose whether, when and who they wish to assist them&#13;
from among the public extension staff, private agencies and NGOs. De-monopolizing&#13;
extension in the context of MASAF activities and creating equal opportunity for public&#13;
and private facilitation are important elements of the MASAF design, intended to&#13;
promote community empowerment. Where necessary, assistance for preparation will be&#13;
provided by the MASAF Zone Office and the line ministry staff. Fees within limits&#13;
specified by MASAF will be paid for private facilitation in respect of approved projects.&#13;
2.15  Appraisal. This ensures that economic viability and sustainability of the&#13;
proposed project (and its consistency with the overall sectoral priorities) are thoroughly&#13;
looked into. Broad principles against which a project proposal is appraised relate to:&#13;
poverty targeting; sectoral norms for technical design and geographical distribution of the&#13;
infrastructure to serve the population efficiently; sustainability in provision for recurrent&#13;
financing as needed; and maintenance, community cofinancing and participation. The&#13;
appraisal is carried out by the multi-sectoral DEC. An important element of targeting is&#13;
establishing the maximum number of projects that can be under implementation at any&#13;
time in a zone. The ceiling prevents the better-off zones from getting unlimited projects&#13;
prepared, approved and funded, and limiting project resources for the relatively poor&#13;
zones. It provides information about the lagging zones where the ceiling is not reached,&#13;
so that a targeted IEC and active facilitation can be arranged. Within a zone, targeting is&#13;
promoted by the DEC members examining the proposal with reference to sectoral&#13;
distribution norms and identifying how best the proposed location would serve the&#13;
disadvantaged areas.&#13;
2.16 By far the most important task of the sectoral member of the DEC during&#13;
appraisal is to assess the technical feasibility of proposals with reference to sector norms&#13;
and to ensure that the recurrent expenditure provisions are available where needed. The&#13;
District Education Officer would ensure, for instance, that teachers are already hired&#13;
where classrooms are proposed; the District Health Officer will support a proposal only&#13;
after being satisfied that provision has been made in the annual budget for health for staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
and supplies to run the proposed facility.4 In instances where the DEC officer strongly&#13;
favors a proposal on its economic merit but there is no provision in the sectoral plan to&#13;
finance the induced recurrent expenditure, the proposal and DEC's recommendation are&#13;
forwarded to the PSC for consideration. The concerned Principal Secretary can consider&#13;
the proposal with a view to finding the needed resource from the ministry's existing plan.&#13;
MASAF will not fund recurrent expenditures nor proposals for which recurrent funding&#13;
will not be available.&#13;
2.17   The appraisal is carried out in two steps. First, by a desk appraisal in which the&#13;
Zone Officer, in consultation with the DEC, verifies the proposal to see vihether: it is&#13;
consistent with sectoral objectives, norms and standards; it is targeted on poor&#13;
communities; the community is willing to make the required contributions; the project is&#13;
technologically simple and do-able by the community; and recurrent expenditure induced,&#13;
if any, will be provided for in the sectoral budget (Annex 6). Where two equally&#13;
meritorious proposals compete for a single slot, additional criteria for selection will be&#13;
used which include: the current availability of services in each locality, and location&#13;
advantage for reaching poor and backward communities. In short, the desk appraisal&#13;
examines whether the proposal is consistent with the selection criteria (Annex 7).&#13;
2.18   The desk appraisal is followed by a field appraisal during which the information&#13;
contained in the community proposal is verified on the ground to see whether the&#13;
proposal meets MASAF requirements (see Annex 9 for field appraisal form). Of&#13;
paramount importance is verification of the community's participation and&#13;
implementation capacity--their commitment to the project, fair representation,&#13;
contribution, and ability to manage funds and operations.5 Initiated and coordinated by the&#13;
Zone Officer, the field appraisal involves the DEC member of the relevant ministry, the&#13;
CPC and the entire community.&#13;
2.19   Transparency of processes at the community level is critical for success.&#13;
Emphasis is placed on informing members of the community about details of the proposal&#13;
including its technical aspects, funds required, and the processes involved in executing&#13;
the work. Confirmation of the self-help contributions promised by the community must&#13;
be made at the time of field appraisal. The capacity of the community to contribute is&#13;
appraised with reference to: (a) assessment of other ongoing projects to which the&#13;
community is contributing, (b) experience in collecting, saving and accounting for funds,&#13;
(c) assessment of the banking facility available to the community, and (d) experience in&#13;
procuring materials, tools and equipment needed for implementation. Once field&#13;
4   For example, the distribution norm for a health clinic is that no health facility exists within 8&#13;
kilometers of the community, the population proposed to be covered is between 8,000 and 10,000&#13;
people, and recurrent budget allocation exists to provide a nurse and drugs by the time the unit is&#13;
complete.&#13;
5   Although the SCC findings and pilot experience show that communities in general can manage funds&#13;
and operations, albeit with training in some cases for book keeping, these abilities would have to be&#13;
validated during appraisal of individual cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
appraisal confirms the viability of the subproject, the appraisal team including the CPC&#13;
and the Zone Officer will sign the community application form as having passed desk&#13;
and field appraisal. Where a project does not meet appraisal criteria, the community will&#13;
be informed on the spot and, if need be, assisted to revise the proposal for re-submission.&#13;
The chairperson of the DEC will keep the DDC informed of projects passing appraisal,&#13;
while the Zone Officer will forward the proposal to the MU.&#13;
2.20 Approval. The appraisal process involves examining project feasibility based on&#13;
the appraisal report and determining whether recurrent financing provisions required are&#13;
available. As members of the PSC, representatives of line ministries participate in&#13;
approval decisions to ensure that geographical distribution of MASAF projects is fair and&#13;
that no facility built under the project remains unproductive for lack of provision for&#13;
recurrent costs. Approval functions are located at the national level, at least initially, to&#13;
ensure that MASAF resources are used efficiently and equitably and that corrective steps&#13;
are taken quickly. The approval of the project is conveyed by the MUto the CPC, ZO&#13;
and DEC through a Project Approval Letter. The CPC is then required to open a bank&#13;
account and prepare for the launch.&#13;
2.21  Implementation, Procurement, Disbursement and Technical&#13;
Support/Supervision. Implementation begins with a launch ceremony at which: (a) the&#13;
community is briefed on the implementation processes, funding and banking procedures,&#13;
(b) the amount laid out for community contribution is stated, (c) arrangements for labor&#13;
contracts and technical supervision are explained, (d) the Community Project Agreement&#13;
(see PIM in the Project file) is signed by the chairperson of the CPC, the Zone Officer&#13;
and the representative of the relevant ministry, (e) relevant contract documents are signed&#13;
and the check for the first tranche of the MASAF assistance is handed to the community,&#13;
and (f) the next steps for communities are stated. The CPC will ensure that there is clear&#13;
division of responsibilities among its members. MASAF releases the second and further&#13;
tranches to the subproject account against certified completed works. For the sake of&#13;
accountability, two or more persons should be responsible for procurement, bookkeeping,&#13;
supervision and storage. Processes relating to procurement and disbursement are&#13;
discussed in Chapter 3, and are laid down in the PIM (see Annex 3 for table of contents).&#13;
Technical support and supervision of project activities will be provided routinely by the&#13;
relevant ministry extension officers and where this is not feasible, technical supervision&#13;
will be contracted out.. Supervision costs will be borne by MASAF. The Zone Officer&#13;
and the district head of the line ministry will monitor the project work.&#13;
2.22 The requirements that the communities handle funds and implement the projects&#13;
are mandated to promote speedy implementation and community empowerment.&#13;
However, these requirements raise issues of capacity and accountability at the community&#13;
level. As evidenced by the SCC, communities are generally confident of their capacity to&#13;
manage the activities that MASAF would fund. This conclusion has been validated by&#13;
the pilot experience. As the Project proceeds, some communities may show inability to&#13;
manage their projects, a matter which would be dealt with by MASAF arranging&#13;
facilitation actively. Accountability is ensured by participation and transparency in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
decision making at the project level, the requirement of community contribution which&#13;
promotes ownership and community's stake in the project funds, and the system of&#13;
linking release of tranches to verification of work done and expenditure incurred with the&#13;
earlier tranches.&#13;
2.23 Monitoring and Evaluation. A system of monitoring and evaluation will be&#13;
established by the MU which will involve line ministries, NGOs and beneficiaries in&#13;
routine feedback and reporting (See para 3.37). Routine reporting would cover physical&#13;
progress on works, adherence to procedures, and financial record keeping. A set of&#13;
performance indicators will be used to monitor progress through routine reporting, site&#13;
visits, meetings and workshops; specific evaluations will be carried out during the life of&#13;
the project including beneficiary assessments. At the end of each project, MASAF will&#13;
issue a certificate of completion which shows, among other things, the total expenditure&#13;
as well as community concurrence that activities specified were carried out. Although&#13;
there are some risks of accountability lapses occurring at the community level, the&#13;
process is designed to be transparent enough to motivate communities to demand full&#13;
accountability for project funds from those assigned implementation responsibilities and&#13;
to insist on restitution if losses occur.&#13;
2.24 The credit will finance CSP which will primarily include: costs of materials for&#13;
construction of schools, health facilities, boreholes, and economic infrastructure;&#13;
technical assistance, training and workshops; office space and equipment; motor vehicles&#13;
and other operating costs of the MU. The credit will also finance equipment and&#13;
supplies; technical assistance, training and workshops; printing and dissemination costs&#13;
for an IEC carnpaign in support of the project.&#13;
Public Works Program (Total US$19.47 million, IDA US$16.80 million)&#13;
2.25  The PWP component will finance safety net operations in poor and food-deficient&#13;
areas through labor-intensive public works involving construction, rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of rural infrastructure. These works will generate significant employment at&#13;
the rural minimum wage to provide a safety net for those who have currently no off-farm&#13;
income earning opportunities. The wages will be paid in cash or a combination of cash&#13;
and food coupons. The principles underlying the PWP emphasize: (a) targeting poor&#13;
areas, (b) high labor intensity, (c) economically productive assets such as rural roads,&#13;
minor irrigation, land development works, community forests, (d) accountability and&#13;
transparency in wage recording and payments, and procurement of materials, (e) a joint&#13;
management structure at the district level to promote higher transparency and&#13;
accountability, as well as pooling of public management resources at the district level to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
overcome capacity constraints,6 (f) private sector participation in supervision and&#13;
execution of works through minor contracting already tried successfully in the country&#13;
and (g) gender considerations. The work selection criteria and principles of&#13;
implementation are provided in Annex 10; detailed procedures are contained in dhe PIM.&#13;
2.26 This component differs from the CSP in objectives, targeting mechanism, and&#13;
processes for identification, preparation and implementation. The main objective of the&#13;
PWP is to transfer cash resources to the poor by employing them in building productive&#13;
common assets. Under the CSP, however, communities identify, manage and cofinance&#13;
their projects; income generation is incidental to community empowerment and creation&#13;
of community assets. The poor gain from these through access to basic services such as&#13;
education and health. The PWP complements the CSP by transferring cash resources to&#13;
the poor for meeting their immediate nutritional and development needs. Accordingly,&#13;
PWP activities, unlike CSP, are determined to have relatively high labor component&#13;
(such as rural road, minor irrigation). To ensure that the PWP benefits reach the areas of&#13;
deepest poverty, 'top down' geographical targeting, planning and management is&#13;
necessary. In contrast, CSP activities are community demand-driven, community&#13;
cofinanced and identified, and are prepared and implemented by communities.&#13;
Community consultation is common to both components, but a more active presence of&#13;
public agencies is necessary under the PWP to ensure that assistance to mitigate seasonal&#13;
hardship is organized on a timely basis.&#13;
2.27   The program will be managed by the District Team of Government officials (see&#13;
para 2.31 and 3.13) who will have the overall responsibility for identification, preparation&#13;
and implementation. MASAF will ensure appraisal, approval and funding of works. The&#13;
actual execution will be carried out by the concerned sector ministry at the district (e.g.&#13;
the Work Supervisor of the Ministry of Works), who will be hiring labor in conjunction&#13;
with the communities. While this will be the dominant mode of execution, some specific&#13;
works such as construction of bridges and culverts might be contracted out to private&#13;
contractors through the existing minor contract procedures. The use of private&#13;
contractors is essential specially to alleviate the capacity constraints of public agencies.&#13;
In case where parts of works are executed by private contractors, public agencies would&#13;
still manage targeting, identification, preparation of works, tendering and administration&#13;
of contracts, and see that equity goals are not compromised. This calls for pooling of&#13;
The available capacity at the district level is currently fragmented, so that no single line ministry&#13;
seems capable of implementing a safety net program . For this project, the responsibility of&#13;
management at the district level rests with the District Team comprising the District Commissioner,&#13;
the Council Clerk and the MOW Supervisor. Each person brings his strengths in organizing&#13;
communities and coordinating, handling funds and accounts, and taking responsibilities for technical&#13;
input. Each of the three has contributed strongly to implementation of the pilots. The district&#13;
commissioners have proved very effective in coordination and mobilization. Their liaison with project&#13;
committees has helped promote the project and has prevented disputes. The district council staff have&#13;
successfully handled procurement and labor payments to allow the district MOW/DRLMP staff to&#13;
concentrate on labor management and the technical aspects of the works. All three districts report that&#13;
the three entities are able to work smoothly together.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
sectoral resources at the district level (see para 2.31) and adoption of the District Team&#13;
approach. While the pilot experience has demonstrated the feasibility and benefit of this&#13;
approach (para 2.51), its validation will have to come from the more widely implemented&#13;
program. It remains to be seen whether there are tangible incentives for the departments&#13;
to work together and whether this arrangement is stable. It is also essential that the&#13;
program not be confined to building rural roads and that other activities such as minor&#13;
irrigation, land improvement, and reforestation are promoted over time. While the pilot&#13;
design has been based on international and African experiences, and addresses many of&#13;
these concerns, more experience is needed to evolve a fully responsive program.&#13;
Consequently, the performance of this component will be reviewed annually and lessons&#13;
learned will be used to adjust the size of the component and its implementation&#13;
mechanism.&#13;
2.28   Identification and Preparation. The responsibility for identification will&#13;
primarily rest with the District Tearn comprising the District Council Clerk, the District&#13;
Commissioner and the Works Supervisor of the Department of Works. A two-step&#13;
targeting process has been adopted to identify activities under the program. First,&#13;
Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) where household food shortages are most severe are&#13;
identified. Out of 180 EPAs in the country, about 45 might benefit from the program&#13;
annually, and these EPAs are likely to fall in 15 districts. Because of wide disparities&#13;
within each district, targeting by district was considered to be too slack. Selection of&#13;
EPAs will be guided by the Vulnerability Assessment Monitoring System (VAM) and&#13;
poverty indicators will be developed as part of the GOM's Poverty Monitoring System&#13;
(PMS).' MASAF will develop a suitable EPA selection criteria for public works using&#13;
VAM data and the key poverty indicators developed as part of the PMS. Targeting criteria&#13;
and selection of EPAs will be approved by the PSC. It is expected that 15 EPAs will be&#13;
selected during 1996/97 and 45 in each subsequent year during the project. During the&#13;
piloting of the program, one EPA each in Mulanje and Machinga Districts, and three&#13;
EPAs in Ntcheu District were selected using this approach.&#13;
2.29   The second targeting step will involve selecting appropriate works in consultation&#13;
with communities of the affected EPA which meet the selection criteria (Annex 10). The&#13;
District Team will carry out identification in consultation with people's elected&#13;
representatives such as Members of Parliament and Councilors, communities and&#13;
community organizations, extension agencies and NGOs. Once a proposal has been&#13;
identified, the community will elect a CPC to assist the District Team in preparation and&#13;
subsequent implementation. During piloting the District Teams were successful in&#13;
The VAM is based on an analysis of crop production data (per capita Kilo Calories) and factors such&#13;
as the availability of food, coping mechanisms at the household level, and other important socio-&#13;
economic indicators. It is being established in a joint collaboration between the World Food Program&#13;
(WFP) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Famine Early Warning&#13;
System. A National Technical Steering Committee has been established under the chairmanship of&#13;
MEPD. Technical support is being provided by the Famine Early Warning System office in Malawi&#13;
and financial support is given by WFP and USAID.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
identifying work proposals and selecting executing agencies in the five EPAs. Six rural&#13;
road proposals were identified and prepared for piloting. Implementing agencies&#13;
identified at this stage of the program were Ministry of Works (MOW) for four sites, and&#13;
the Christian Service Society, an NGO, for two sites.&#13;
2.30 Appraisal and Approval. The proposals prepared by the District Team are&#13;
submitted to MASAF for appraisal and approval. Appraisal ensures that selection criteria&#13;
are met. The proposals are approved by the PSC. A major concern at this stage is to&#13;
verify high labor content in the project. During appraisal of the pilot proposals, MASAF&#13;
found that the proportion of wages in the total project cost was too low because of a&#13;
higher technical specification. The non-labor component also tended to be high on&#13;
account of high material cost and low wages in the country. These proposals were&#13;
revised: this increased the labor component from roughly 16 percent to 36 percent of&#13;
total cost.&#13;
2.31  Joint Management at the District Level. At this level, the project will be&#13;
managed jointly by the District Council, the District Commissioner and the Department&#13;
of Works (see para 3.13). This approach pools the available managerial resources and&#13;
distributes tasks according to institutional strengths. District commissioners coordinate the&#13;
program, as they do for DDC activities, and using their links with community&#13;
organizations, mobilize the communities. Their liaison with the Community Project&#13;
Committees has helped promote the project and prevent disputes during the pilot phase.&#13;
Since district councils have the best capacity in keeping accounts at the district level, they&#13;
have been given the responsibility of handling funds and accounts. During the pilot phase,&#13;
the district council staff have successfully handled procurement and labor payments to&#13;
allow the district MOW/DRIMP staff to concentrate on labor management and the technical&#13;
aspects of the works. This collegial structure is also meant to ensure transparency.&#13;
Procurement and disbursement decisions are required to be approved by all the three&#13;
members of the District Team.&#13;
2.32 Implementation. While the responsibility of identifying, preparing and overall&#13;
management of the program rests with the District Team, execution will be entrusted to a&#13;
public agency: the district MOW office for roads and bridges, or to private contractors&#13;
and NGOs. While the execution will be the responsibility of the concerned ministry&#13;
(Work Supervisor of MOW for a rural road), who will hire labor in conjunction with the&#13;
communities, parts of a project, such as culverts and bridges might be contracted out to&#13;
private contractors. Private sector participation in the execution of works is meant to&#13;
alleviate capacity constraints in public agencies, as well as to promotes private sector&#13;
capacity building. The District Team will award minor contracts according to the 'minor&#13;
contract' procedures of the MOW's District Roads Improvement Program (DRIMP), and&#13;
outlined in the PIM, which is based on competitive selection. The principles governing&#13;
implementation include ensuring transparency in hiring and remunerating, strict&#13;
accountability for payments, quick response in initiating works, economic value of assets&#13;
built, enhancing benefits for women, ensuring safety of tools, and close monitoring and&#13;
supervision. While labor and material to be procured are determined by the executing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
agencies, approval of quantities is the responsibility of the District Team. The receipt of&#13;
material, labor attendance and wage disbursements are counter-signed by community&#13;
members (see PWP PIM for details - Project File).&#13;
2.33 Supervision. Works will be technically supervised by the concerned line&#13;
ministry at the district, for example, the MOW district staff for roads. The work of the&#13;
district staff will be further supervised by the regional and national offices of the&#13;
departments concerned (the practice for normal departmental works). Where the existing&#13;
regional and national staff is unable to handle supervision, MASAF will hire private&#13;
agencies/consultants. The supervision procedures (the minimum extent of supervision for&#13;
each work) are specified in the PIM.&#13;
2.34 Links with Technical Ministries. Existing district technical and financial&#13;
procedures proved adequate at the pilot stage, but these need to be improved and updated&#13;
so that increased work-load during the full-scale implementation can be coped with&#13;
efficiently. Active involvement of technical ministries would be essential for tbis and for&#13;
providing adequate supervision and quality control. MOW is participating in the&#13;
development of the program and the management of the pilot. To this end, MOW has&#13;
assigned a desk officer in the ministry for the MASAF program. The Ministry will assist&#13;
the MU with:&#13;
*  adapting MOW procedures and forms for use under the PWP, reviewing and&#13;
updating them on an ongoing basis;&#13;
*  supervising the pilots and the mainstreamed program;&#13;
*  assisting with the contracting of technical supervision, and&#13;
*  developing alternative labor-intensive activities within the program such as&#13;
construction of small irrigation systems, road maintenance, land development&#13;
and reforestation.&#13;
2.35 Monitoring and Evaluation. PWP will be monitored using progress indicators&#13;
(Annex 1 1). MASAF will constitute monitoring and evaluation teams from time to time&#13;
to check on physical progress and financial reporting. A reporting system being&#13;
developed will be linked to the management information system being set up at the MU.&#13;
MASAF will undertake evaluation of the program impact through beneficiary assessment&#13;
to be organized as part of the PMSF activities. On completion of works, the Team will&#13;
prepare a report on activities and their costs for submission to MASAF. At the end of the&#13;
MASAF project, Government's domestic resources should phase in for the maintenance of&#13;
the assets created.&#13;
Poverty Monitoring Support Facility Component (Total US$1.51 million, IDA&#13;
US$1.00 million)&#13;
2.36 Background. The GOM initiated some major efforts in 1994/95 to improve&#13;
coordination of poverty monitoring activities, to promote use of poverty data and to avoid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
duplication in data collection or analysis. A national Technical Working Committee&#13;
(TWC) for poverty monitoring has been established, comprising all relevant Government&#13;
institutions and NGOs, Bunda College, Center for Social Research, and various donor&#13;
agencies that operate in this field.8 Five TWC meetings and two working sessions have&#13;
been held during 1995 and up to February 1996 to discuss establishing an institutional&#13;
framework for establishing a Poverty Monitoring System (PMS): identifying priority&#13;
indicators for monitoring, stock-taking of existing monitoring activities, identifying gaps,&#13;
and developing a plan of action for poverty monitoring. The Poverty Alleviation and Social&#13;
Policy Section of the MEP&amp;D convened the TWC meetings9 and prepared a PMS concept&#13;
document Nature, Scope and Action Plan for the Poverty Monitoring System (latest edition,&#13;
version 3.6, February 1995) stating the priorities for poverty monitoring in the country. The&#13;
GOM expects donors to assist in the coordinated monitoring effort by financing elements&#13;
of the core program identified by the TWC. In this spirit the MASAF component,&#13;
Poverty Monitoring Support Facility (PMSF), will provide financing for elements within&#13;
a core poverty monitoring program identified by the TWC.&#13;
2.37 Objective. The PMSF component of MASAF will assist GOM to monitor poverty&#13;
by financing the essential building blocks for collection and analysis of data relevant to&#13;
track progress in poverty reduction and to help guide formulation of poverty alleviation&#13;
policies and programs. The Poverty Monitoring Support Facility (PMSF) will provide&#13;
financing in the following areas: (i) the strengthening of technical capacity of institutions to&#13;
co-ordinate, collect, analyse, disseminate and use data relevant for poverty reduction&#13;
policies and programs; (ii) the development and implementation of an Integrated Household&#13;
Survey Program at the National Statistical Office; (iii) the provision of funds for poverty&#13;
analysis. The particular activities to be financed under the PMSF will be specified in&#13;
annual work programs prepared by the TWC and agreed with IDA at the beginning of each&#13;
annual period. The MASAF MU will not be responsible for technical appraisal of use of&#13;
PMSF funds but will disburse PMSF funds as per the agreed annual work program and the&#13;
MASAF Financial and Accounting Manual.&#13;
2.38   Strengthening Technical Capacity. In support of the objective of achieving a&#13;
streamlined and cost-effective PMS, it will be necessary to consolidate existing data&#13;
8   The members of the TWC, as of February 1996, were: MEP&amp;D (chairperson), office of PAP&#13;
coordinator, NSO (agriculture and economics section), Ministry of Health and Population (CHSU,&#13;
HIS &amp; Planning Section), Ministry of Women and Children Affairs and Community Development&#13;
(MSU and Planning), Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Livestock, Director Center for&#13;
Social Research, Bunda College (Rural Development, Agriculture Policy &amp; Research Unit),&#13;
Executive Secretary for CONGOMA, UNICEF (Monitoring Unit), Director for the World Food&#13;
Program, Ministry of Research and Environmental Affairs, Ministry of Irrigation and Water&#13;
Development, Ministry of Local Government &amp; Rural Development, Chamber of Commerce,&#13;
IMPACT (Initiative for the Mobilisation of Private Action). The development and design of the&#13;
national Poverty Monitoring System will continue to be guided by the TWC.&#13;
9   A permanent Poverty Monitoring Unit within this section at EP&amp;D is proposed to be the secretariat of&#13;
the TWC. Although full staffing decisions of the PMU is awaiting GOM approval, the PMU has&#13;
recently recruited three economists and has started functioning in a limited way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
collection instruments, strengthen selected ones and commission new instruments as&#13;
necessary. Moreover, in order to ensure the data is policy relevant and is used by policy&#13;
makers, program managers in ministries, NGOs and communities, it is necessary to&#13;
maintain constant dialogue between the users and producers of poverty-related data and to&#13;
ensure timely analysis and dissemination. It will also be necessary to have a Poverty&#13;
Monitoring Unit (PMU) with the personnel, skills mix and infrastructure iequired to&#13;
maintain co-ordination of these activities and to achieve the most effective forms of&#13;
dissemination and policy impact. In order to assist the GOM in achieving these objectives,&#13;
PMSF funds will be available to finance a range of activities which would strengthen the&#13;
capacity of institutions to achieve identified PMS goals. These activities can include&#13;
financing for technical expertise on aspects of poverty monitoring, training, equipment, data&#13;
user-producer workshops, publications. The TWC will identify the specific capacity&#13;
development activities which will be financed under the PMSF. Furthermore, it is expected&#13;
that funds for strengthening technical capacity will be used to finance preparation and&#13;
production of an Annual Report on poverty status and policy implications. The annual&#13;
report will draw on the core PMS program to build an analysis of the core poverty&#13;
indicators, an evaluation of the impact on poverty of policies and program interventions,&#13;
and indicate the specific policy implications for instruments such as the PSIP, PFP, DevPol,&#13;
etc. and various targeted programs such as the 5th Country Program, MASAF, etc. The&#13;
TWC will decide on priority research areas and focus for the annual report. It is expected&#13;
that the draft report will be available for discussion by end of October each year. This will&#13;
facilitate the presentation of the annual report on poverty, economic and social policy at the&#13;
CG meetings in December.&#13;
2.39 Development of an Integrated Household Survey Program at NSO. The second&#13;
major stream of financing under the PMSF will be for the development and&#13;
implementation of an Integrated Household Survey Program at the NSO. Development&#13;
of an IHSP will involve long-term planning of the topics, sample size, frequency, use and&#13;
resource needs of household surveys. The NSO will carry out a household survey on a&#13;
core set of indicators on a regular basis. Periodically, supplementary modules will be&#13;
added depending on demand. The objectives of the IHSP are to:&#13;
*  provide rapid reliable information on key indicators of living conditions&#13;
regularly;&#13;
*  establish a cost-effective data collection system which is comparable and&#13;
stardardized;&#13;
*  coordinate social statistics within the NSO and relevant Ministries; and&#13;
*  provide different users with a system of social indicators to monitor social&#13;
development.&#13;
2.40 The development of an IHSP at the NSO will be guided by a user-producer sub-&#13;
committee of the TWC established in January, 1996. The committee is chaired by the&#13;
NSO and has representatives from CSR, Bunda College, and the EP&amp;D (as the&#13;
representative of the PMU). The PMSF will finance the development of the IHSP under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
the guidance of the committee, including improvements in the integration and&#13;
collaboration across surveys 1, technical support for the design of the questionnaire and&#13;
the technical preparation for data collection, processing, and dissemination. The&#13;
emphasis of PMSF financing is intended to be on the planning, design and development&#13;
phase, including field-testing. The World Bank will assist the GOM in finding donor&#13;
support for the initial implementation of the IHSP . It is expected that over an agreed&#13;
period, the financing will be internalized by the GOM through an increase in its share of&#13;
financing of the survey program.&#13;
2.41   A Program of Poverty Analysis. There is an abundance of poverty relevant data&#13;
in Malawi. Data exists in ministries, local government, university and National Statistical&#13;
Office, research institutions and donor agencies. Although there is an active and well&#13;
organized research community in Malawi, gaps exist in analyzing the data and making&#13;
results of the analysis available to the public. PMSF resources will be used to initiate a&#13;
program of studies whose main purpose would be analysis of poverty issues and the&#13;
effects of economic policies on poor and vulnerable groups. The resources for poverty&#13;
analysis will be used to build on and improve linkages between the research community,&#13;
policy makers and implementors and assist in dissemination of results. The specific&#13;
objectives for the analysis program are to:&#13;
* identify the effects of social and economic policies on the poor and vulnerable&#13;
with a view to developing programs which would cushion adverse effects;&#13;
*  assist in the formulation of policies and implementation of programs so that&#13;
effective targeting of social safety net activities can be improved;&#13;
*  improve the dialogue between data collectors, researchers, policy makers and&#13;
implementors so that relevant data is collected, analyzed and used in a timely&#13;
and appropriate manner and presented to policy makers; and&#13;
*  encourage the use of poverty-related studies as means to build analytical&#13;
capacity at different levels of society (research, students, NGOs, journplists,&#13;
communities, etc.).&#13;
2.42 Main activities supported in the program of poverty analysis will be:&#13;
*  small studies conducting in-depth analysis on specific topics;&#13;
*  beneficiary assessments and cost-effectiveness/cost-benefit analyses&#13;
evaluating social safety net activities such as MASAF community projects;&#13;
*  participatory Poverty Assessments focusing on geographical areas identified&#13;
as severely poor; and&#13;
10  The committee will explore the ways in which the design of the IHS can be coordinated with the&#13;
proposed DHS, the Census and the M4E (Monitoring for Empowerment) data collection program. It&#13;
will also integrate the plans for completing processing of the 1992-93 NSSA data.&#13;
l  Depending on the availability of such funds, however, the World Bank and the TWC would review&#13;
the possibility of using PMSF funds for actual implementation expenditures of the first IHS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
* national poverty studies conducted annually on priority indicators of poverty;&#13;
these will preferably be done by established research institutions such as the&#13;
Center for Social Research, Bunda College, and other sections of the&#13;
University of Malawi, and will feed into the production of the annual report&#13;
on poverty status and economic and social policy.&#13;
2.43  As per its mandate to coordinate poverty monitoring activities, the TWC will set&#13;
up a multi-disciplinary sub-committee which will serve as a coordinating technical body&#13;
for poverty-related research. The Poverty Analysis (PA) sub-committee will consist of&#13;
members of the TWC and include assigned PMU personnel. The terms of reference for&#13;
this Poverty Analysis (PA) sub-committee will be defined by the TWC. As a part of its&#13;
tasks, the PA sub-committee will appraise studies to be funded from PMSF resources.&#13;
The PA sub-committee will assist in appraising study proposals, identifying data sources,&#13;
providing guidance on research methodologies relevant to the study proposal. It will&#13;
recommend studies to the TWC for approval. The sub-committee is also required to&#13;
report back to the full TWC on progress in studies under implementation. The MASAF&#13;
Beneficiary Assessments will be managed and coordinated with the MASAF&#13;
management unit. The PMU will be responsible for dissemination of research findings.&#13;
In order to facilitate the functioning of the program for poverty analysis, the TWAC may,&#13;
at a later date, identify the need for technical assistance. The Study Cycle for all studies&#13;
financed under the PMSF is described in Annex 12.&#13;
2.44  It is expected that as it starts functioning, the PA sub-committee will begin to&#13;
coordinate studies to be financed not only through the PMSF, but also by other donors&#13;
and GOM. This will avoid duplication and encourage economies of scale in conducting&#13;
analysis.&#13;
2.45  The credit will finance: technical assistance, training, workshops, equipment,&#13;
supplies, and incremental operating costs.&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.46 International. The social fund approach has been used successfully in many&#13;
developing countries during the past decade, and the World Bank has supported over 30&#13;
such funds worldwide. Experience'2 has shown that the most successful funds have&#13;
fostered community initiative, enjoyed political support at a high level, involved other&#13;
agencies (which coordinates effort and ensures sustainability), employed qualified staff&#13;
with autonomy to operate, used simple procurement procedures, practiced frequent&#13;
supervision and established learning mechanisms to modify their way of working when&#13;
necessary. Their effectiveness depends on having clearly defined objectives and&#13;
transparent criteria from the outset. Experience shows that social funds do not reach the&#13;
12 "Social Funds: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Conditions for Success" L.S. Khadiagala, January 1995,&#13;
ESD Discussion Paper Series, World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
poorest groups easily and that to reach the very poor, an active outreach strategy is&#13;
required. The funds face tradeoffs between rapid implementation and active community&#13;
involvement. Social funds are not a substitute for sectoral reform and capacity building,&#13;
and their activities must be geared to complement sectoral priorities.&#13;
2.47  Depending on a country's circumstances, social funds have emphasized creating&#13;
infrastructure and employment or building capacity at the community level. The two&#13;
approaches can reinforce each other, but they can affect communities in different ways&#13;
and rely on different implementation procedures. MASAF has adopted a mix of the two&#13;
objectives, emphasizing the creation of infrastructure and employment in the near term,&#13;
while building the capacity to implement community-based interventions throughout the&#13;
country in the longer term.&#13;
2.48  In-country. The design of MASAF benefited from review of relevant on-going&#13;
in-country activities carried out by other donors; data are available in the Project file. In&#13;
one example, while activities strengthened institutions at the district level, the decision-&#13;
making structure was still "top down". In another, although there was high community&#13;
ownership, the speed of implementation was slow. In yet another instance where&#13;
development activities included resource flow to beneficiaries, 40 percent of these funds&#13;
were expended on administration, which reduced the amount of funds available for&#13;
beneficiaries. While building on the strengths of these projects, MASAF attempts to go&#13;
further by making project processes more demand-driven and assigning critical decision&#13;
making tasks and responsibilities to communities. MASAF allows a level playing field&#13;
for GOM and non-government facilitators, while keeping the choice with the&#13;
communities as to when and which facilitator to use. Piloting allowed core decisions&#13;
regarding functions, structure and staffing proposed for MASAF to be made and for the&#13;
procedures and processes to be used under the project to be formulated and tested.&#13;
Nineteen subprojects were approved as of December 8, 1995; work has begun on ten&#13;
sites, seven await completion of geophysical surveys and start-up of drilling by&#13;
contractors and three are on hold because of problems with community contribution. The&#13;
President launched the first subproject in September 1995; 1,100 persons from the&#13;
community presented themselves for work at one of the PWP sites. To cope with the fast&#13;
pace of expenditure, a supplemental Project Preparation Facility of $1 million was&#13;
processed, raising the total to $2 million.&#13;
2.49 National Level. Experiences at national level, where decisions on policy,&#13;
management structures and approvals are made, differ from those at district and&#13;
community levels where processing and implementation occur. Creation of an&#13;
autonomous public institution such as MASAF was a new experience for the&#13;
Government; autonomy came slowly to MASAF in spite of Government's willingness to&#13;
act and communities' expressed demand. Strong political support for the projec. in the&#13;
end assured speedy decision making in the project's preparation; particular referenLe&#13;
should be made in this context to the frequent meetings held by the PSC to expedite&#13;
decisions on project proposals. MASAF faces dilemma. While it has the advantage of a&#13;
fast-disbursing facility (speed of response to approved funding requests), its core&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
requirement of letting communities drive the process slows the pace. Much facilitation&#13;
will be required initially for the first sub-projects, which will necessitate visiting,&#13;
explaining and training "on-the-job" DEC officials, facilitators and communities. IEC is&#13;
a crucial activity of the Fund. Initial indications on the speed of implementation of&#13;
individual projects (once agreed on and approved) are very positive (eight days to get a&#13;
school block to the window level at Kamwala), but the estimated time lag from&#13;
conception to launch is 23 weeks and the average project size is US$ 50,000.&#13;
2.50 Some pilot experiences noted by the project appraisal team follow:&#13;
*  the institutional set-up and current and proposed staffing of MU, including the&#13;
linkages with the relevant sectors, are adequate to initiate implementation of&#13;
the mainstreamed Project;&#13;
*  communities have experience in collecting, saving and accounting for funds,&#13;
and they can procure materials, tools and equipment needed to carry out&#13;
community projects;&#13;
*  the draft PIMs for CSP and PWP are sufficiently advanced and have been&#13;
used successfully during piloting;&#13;
*  the mechanisms for involving NGOs, private individuals and organizations as&#13;
contractors for implementing the CSP and PWP components, have been&#13;
suitably defined during the appraisal mission and have been agreed upon;&#13;
*  capacity building activities are sufficiently advanced according to the report&#13;
on training to date, and work plans drawn for both the CSP and PWP&#13;
components are feasible (see Annex 13);&#13;
*  the CSP and PWP targeting and implementation plans have potential for&#13;
creating community level assets and providing safety nets for the poor;&#13;
*  the project activities under both components are potentially sustainable after&#13;
project completion since activities funded would then be part of sectoral&#13;
priorities and programs;&#13;
*  environmental aspects of the project have been given due consideration&#13;
through provision for landscaping, and contouring, sanitation, water provision,&#13;
and tree planting at each of the physical sites;&#13;
*  the participation and empowerment of women has been adequately provided&#13;
for in the project design as demonstrated by footnote 3 page 14;&#13;
*  the arrangements for assessing project impacts through participatory&#13;
beneficiary assessments have been defined and a schedule of indicators is&#13;
under preparation;&#13;
*  experience from the CSP piloting has shown that communities in the urban&#13;
and peri-urban areas have responded slowly (organization), and inadequately&#13;
(levels of contributions)'3. This has been attributed to lack of social cohesion,&#13;
13 The Mtandire subproject community contribution of 40,000 bricks for 4-8 classroom blocks is&#13;
considered far too low and Naotcha community has not been able to specify what they will be able to&#13;
contribute. The Mzuzu urban market subproject is faced with the same low to nil contribution from&#13;
the community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
poverty and weak leadership, all characteristics of transient populations.&#13;
While urban subprojects are less suited to the criteria specified for the CSP&#13;
(and there is currently no other vehicle to respond to their widespread need),&#13;
the vocal nature of the urban population makes it difficult for GOM to exclude&#13;
them from this project. Discussions will continue with the PSC and MU to&#13;
resolve this dilemma which disadvantages the urban communities as a whole;&#13;
and&#13;
inadequate capacity in-country to survey and drill boreholes has resulted in&#13;
slow implementation of these subprojects. Discussions continue with&#13;
UNICEF, the Department of Water, NGOs and private agencies to (a) develop&#13;
a workable strategy to define essential phases in the cycle of borehole&#13;
provision, (b) identify skills needed to perform at each point in the cycle, (c)&#13;
assign responsibilities according to the skills of the main actors, and (d)&#13;
mobilize technical expertise to support the requirements. In order to gain&#13;
economies of scale, community requests for boreholes have been pooled and&#13;
packaged before the issue of invitations for contractors to bid. This practice&#13;
has resulted in projects of this type requiring longer to complete.&#13;
2.51  The following PWP piloting results are particularly noteworthy:&#13;
Targeting. Selection of pilot areas was consistent with the targeting objective. All&#13;
four EPAs selected for piloting have visibly high poverty incidence; ir. three, most&#13;
families along the road are already reduced to one maize meal per day. There are&#13;
very few alternative sources of employment or income. The number of people who&#13;
would like to work on the roads projects greatly exceeds the available positions.&#13;
Economic Value of the Assets. Communities value the assets being buiit as&#13;
contributing to their long-term development as well as providing temporary&#13;
employment. Their willingness to sacrifice without compensation trees on private&#13;
lands and portions of private fields adjacent to the roads was indicative of the&#13;
collective local commitment to the roads.&#13;
Institutions. (a) Project level--communities have constituted CPCs at the project&#13;
level and have been effective in labor recruitment, daily labor registration,&#13;
resolution of right-of-way issues, implementation arrangements and communication&#13;
between the project staff and communities. (b) District level--the institutional&#13;
arrangement at the district level has worked smoothly; each official of the District&#13;
Team - the Distict Commissioner, the Council Clerk and the MOW DRIMP&#13;
Supervisor - has been able to bring specific institutional strengths to bear on the&#13;
implementation of the pilots; the district commissioners proved effective in&#13;
coordination and mobilization; the district council staff have successfully handled&#13;
procurement and labor payments to allow the district MOW/DRIMP staff to&#13;
concentrate on labor management and the technical aspects of the works. (c)&#13;
National level--although recruited principally for work with the CSP component,&#13;
the current staff of the MU has successfully carried out project appraisal, funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
and supervision. A Public Works Division is now being established within the MU,&#13;
comprising a PWP Coordinator and an engineer, to manage the PWP component of&#13;
the mainstreamed project.&#13;
Procedures. Procurement, accounting, and labor payment have been carried out&#13;
according to procedures and standard practices, and with adequate documentation.&#13;
This included successful payment in the field of up to 800 workers in a day by&#13;
District Council staff. Tools were procured locally by all the three districts. In&#13;
addition to the joint management of the project at and below district level, other&#13;
measures to promote transparency and accountability, such as separating&#13;
procurement and payment requests from actual disbursements, and use of CPCs to&#13;
witness labor payments, have all worked smoothly.&#13;
Food Distribution. Negotiating the details of food distribution contracts and&#13;
helping to ensure that food is actually delivered, is difficult and time-consuming&#13;
for the MU. At the field level, logistic difficulties have delayed food distribution.&#13;
However, because of food shortages in the project areas, the failure of the&#13;
commercial market to bring food close to the people in need, and the lower price&#13;
for maize provided by the food coupons, partial payment in the form of food was&#13;
appreciated by some laborers where this was implemented.&#13;
SPECIAL PROJECT ISSUES&#13;
2.52  Gender Considerations. Thirty percent of all rural households are headed by&#13;
women, and this ratio increases to 42 percent for the poorest 20 percent smallholder&#13;
households. Average food share in the total household expenditure is higher (66 percent)&#13;
for FHHs than for the male-headed households, indicating a deeper poverty among the&#13;
former.&#13;
2.53  The specific problems that women, particularly the FHHs, face are related to their&#13;
lower coping abilities. They have lower access to credit and extension, and lower&#13;
education and health status. Because of the lack of access to technology, women&#13;
perform highly onerous tasks, such as maize grinding, fuel wood gathering and&#13;
transportation of water for home use. These constraints notwithstanding, women&#13;
participate in the labor force in nearly the sarne proportion as men. They are likely to&#13;
share benefits from MASAF in two ways--by access to employment opportunities and&#13;
water, health and education facilities which the project will help establish.&#13;
2.54  Special care will be taken to ensure that target groups such as poor women, FHHs&#13;
and other disadvantaged groups benefit fully from MASAF. The project promotional&#13;
activities will focus attention on women's priorities and needs and support women's&#13;
involvement in the design, implementation and management of subprojects. The&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system will track the participation of women in MASAF&#13;
projects and the effects on female beneficiaries, especially in areas and kinds of projects&#13;
where opportunities to reach women have previously been missed. Women's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
representation in CPCs was achieved during piloting and will be emphasized during&#13;
implementation. All MASAF staff and facilitators will be trained to maximize benefits to&#13;
women's and encourage their participation.&#13;
2.55  Environment. The project will have no adverse environmental impact and has&#13;
received a rating of C. No environmental assessment is necessary. Environmental&#13;
concerns will be built into subproject appraisal and monitoring criteria as in the&#13;
Facilitators' Manual in the project file. For the CSP, terracing of the building site,&#13;
planting of trees, drainage at the water facility, and provision of latrines with appropriate&#13;
vents will be emphasized at the design and appraisal stages. MASAF will ensure that its&#13;
staff and DEC members are trained in environmental requirements, which will also be&#13;
specific aspects of project monitoring (see Field Activity Monitoring Form, DEC&#13;
Manual). Construction using unburned bricks has been piloted successfully and is&#13;
expected to be used by communities on a significant scale. For rural roads under the&#13;
PWP, care will be taken to provide adequate culverts, bridges and side drainage to ensure&#13;
that the natural drainage system is not interfered with. The PWP activities such as land&#13;
improvement by terracing and planting of vetiver on field boundaries, reforestation and&#13;
minor irrigation, will lead to greater soil-moisture conservation, recharge of underground&#13;
water resources, and improve flora within the project areas. Overall, the project is&#13;
expected to have a positive environmental impact.&#13;
2.56 Poverty Targeting. The CSP component of the project is demand-driven and&#13;
self-targeting. The findings of the Poverty Profile demonstrate how pervasive poverty is&#13;
in Malawi, especially rural poverty (as a percentage) which makes it highly likely that&#13;
rural project requests would be from needy communities. Given this, accurate targeting&#13;
at the start of the project may not be imperative or be likely to yield different results.&#13;
Subsequent geographical targeting, which would link population density by district with&#13;
subproject concentration, could be adopted to ensure that poor and remote areas have&#13;
reasonable access to project benefits (see para 2.10). In two years, when more experience&#13;
has been gained, greater precision could be built into the targeting, using criteria such as&#13;
current access to services and visible measures of wealth such as motor cars, or bicycles&#13;
in the community. GOM has constituted an inter-ministerial group of officials to decide&#13;
on targeting criteria. One option being examined is to demarcate zones according to&#13;
population, with each zone being allowed to handle a given number of projects. Some&#13;
zones might be allowed to engage staff and have financial outlays roughly in proportion&#13;
to their population. Demand- constrained poverty areas could also be supported by&#13;
MASAF devoting greater resources for IEC and facilitation services to these areas. PMSF&#13;
funds for poverty analysis can be utilized to develop an appropriate set of indicators for&#13;
ex-ante targeting. These can be incorporated in the project at mid-term review..&#13;
2.57 The PWP component of the project will adopt a two-step geographical targeting&#13;
of poverty--first by selecting EPAs with highest poverty incidence, then by locating a&#13;
targeted EPA in those parts worst affected. Further analysis of ways to improve criteria&#13;
for targeting will be supported under the program of poverty analysis financed by the&#13;
PMSF component. As to targeting individual households, a self-targeting mechanism is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
promoted by the project through keeping daily wages at the level of the minimum rural&#13;
wage which is lower than the market wage (during piloting the daily wage is MK7.50;&#13;
MOW pays MK12.00 per day to unskilled labor in their regular programs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.1   Project preparation was guided by learning by listening and doing through SCC&#13;
and piloting experiences before mainstreaming. The project design further allows&#13;
procedures and institutional roles to evolve during the life of MASAF. There is&#13;
continuous trial and upgrading of the procedures as the new approach gains root. The&#13;
project processes inform the development of MASAF, and act as catalyst within sectoral&#13;
ministries. Continuous consultation with the communities with the help of beneficiary&#13;
assessment exercises will provide periodic feedback. The project will be managed in&#13;
accordance with guidelines and operational procedures set out in a Project&#13;
Implementation Manual (PIM) for the operation of the Community Subprojects and the&#13;
Public Works Program (see Annex 3 and para: 5.1).&#13;
SYSTEMATIC CLIENT CONSULTATION&#13;
3.2   The SCC was carried out during the identification stage of the Project to elicit&#13;
information on key project design issues relating to community organizations and&#13;
institutional network, community experience and attitudes towards community&#13;
development and community-level skills, particularly the feasibility of direct community&#13;
financing. Nineteen communities were interviewed and their views obtained; these&#13;
findings were confirmed by two further SCC actions carried out by the Agriculture and&#13;
Environment Division of the Southern Africa Department. To continue the listening and&#13;
learning mode, beneficiary assessments will be conducted at regular intervals, first 12&#13;
months after project effectiveness, and then annually over the life of the Project (see para.&#13;
2.42). These assessments will rely on a mix of qualitative and participatory research&#13;
techniques similar to those used during the initial SCC activities and known to elicit a&#13;
wide range of voices within communities. The SCC will also feed into the monitoring&#13;
exercises (see para. 3.36).&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL SETUP&#13;
3.3   Both CSP and PWP are community-responsive and will use MASAF mechanisms&#13;
to disburse funds rapidly and directly to projects. The identification, implementation and&#13;
management of subprojects will be the responsibility of communities. For the PWP, this&#13;
function is undertaken by the District Teamn. Selection criteria and processes are&#13;
discussed in Chapter 2. An organogram is given in Annex 14, and a chart of the project&#13;
cycle for CSP and PWP is given in Annex 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
3.4   Management Structure. MASAF will be managed by an autonomous MU based&#13;
in Lilongwe. During negotiations, agreement was reached between the GOM and IDA&#13;
that the MU will be responsible for implementing the project (para: 5.2(a). A PSC&#13;
chaired by the Principal Secretary for MEPD, with members from key sectors, NGOs and&#13;
the National Commission for Women, will oversee the work of the MU. The PSC will&#13;
(a) provide overall guidance on management of MASAF; (b) give direction and guidance&#13;
in the interpretation of Government and sectoral policies; (c) approve MU's annual work&#13;
plans; (d) approve project proposals for MASAF funding; and (e) ensure that secioral&#13;
budgets accommodate recurrent expenses required for use of MASAF project outputs.&#13;
Details of MASAF's structure at all levels are given in the Financial and Accounting&#13;
Manual and Administration Manual available in the Project files. A description of the&#13;
activities carried out by various participants follows:&#13;
3.5   Management Unit (MU). The MU has five divisions at its central office:&#13;
Technical Services, responsible for technical appraisal of project proposals, technical&#13;
supervision and procurement; Field Operations, which supervises field operations and&#13;
assists zonal staff in appraisal and monitoring of community projects; Finance, which is&#13;
responsible for day-to-day financial management of MASAF, preparation of its annual&#13;
operations budget, disbursement, accounting and auditing; Administration, which is&#13;
responsible for routine office administration, public relations and procurement at the&#13;
center and the regions, as well as coordination of contracts; and Public Works Division&#13;
comprising a PWP Coordinator and an engineer who, with support from the&#13;
Administriaion, Management Information Systems, including Research and Evaluation,&#13;
and Finance Divisions, will manage the PWP component. A Manager appointed by&#13;
GOM serves as the chief executive of MASAF and Secretary to the PSC. The Manager's&#13;
duties are to (a) recruit and administer personnel according to the procedures laid out in&#13;
the Finance Manual and Administration Manual; (b) prepare the annual work program&#13;
and budget; (c) oversee project implementation; (d) coordinate and supervise field&#13;
activities; (e) promote MASAF activities; (f) negotiate and sign all MASAF contracts;&#13;
and (g) prepare detailed quarterly reports on the activities and financial status of MASAF.&#13;
MU staff will require external technical assistance (TA) in implementing and supervising&#13;
some activities. At negotiations a schedule of TA and training plans for the three&#13;
components acceptable to IDA were submitted (para: 5.1 (b). To ensure smooth&#13;
implementation of the Project, it was agreed during negotiations that the positions of&#13;
Manager, and Heads of Operations, Technical Services, Public Works Division, Finance,&#13;
Internal Audit and Administration will be filled at all times by staff having qualifications&#13;
and experience satisfactory to IDA (para 5.2 (b)). During Negotiations, agreement was&#13;
also reached confirming that the unit price data bank (para 3.24), to be maintained by the&#13;
Technical Services Unit of MASAF, will be updated every three to six months (para 5.2&#13;
(h)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
Community Subprojects Structure&#13;
3.6   Zone Offices. There are nine Zone Offices, each covering two to three districts&#13;
(see Box 4) throughout the country, manned by a Zone Officer and an assistant. The&#13;
Offices have the responsibility of preparing the Zone's annual work plan which includes&#13;
budgets for operational costs, facilitating communities and other organizations in the&#13;
approval and implementation of projects, and fostering efficient and effective working&#13;
relationships with key district level institutions. Details of the Zone Offices' activities&#13;
are provided in the MASAF Project Concept Document (PCD).&#13;

A Zone Officer will be responsible for a maximum of20 projects at any one time.&#13;
3.7   DEC. Sector heads and technical representatives at the district level constitute&#13;
the members of DEC, which is the main technical advisory body to the DDC. As the&#13;
MASAF link at the district level, DEC, through the District Development Officer&#13;
(DDO)14, will assist Zone Offices in the desk and field appraisal of subproject proposals.&#13;
DEC will be responsible for advising the Zone Officer on sectoral norms and&#13;
requirements, as well as confirming commitment to meet necessary recurrent costs, to&#13;
ensure that assets created are sustainable.&#13;
3.8 Project Facilitators. The principal ownership of the project remains with the&#13;
communities, who are free to decide whether and which facilitator they want to work&#13;
with. Facilitators could be GOM field staff, NGOs, private organizations, social and&#13;
religious groups or individuals and will be primarily accountable to the community.&#13;
When an NGO is requested to assist the community in any aspect of the project cycle,&#13;
MASAF will have the responsibility to ensure that the NGO (a) is properly registered&#13;
In districts without a DDO, assistance will be provided through the Assistant District Commissioner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
with GOM and in good standing; (b) has the requisite organizational and technical skills,&#13;
and adequate experience in the appropriate field; (c) has credibility with the beneficiary&#13;
group it intends to work with; and (d) has a satisfactory accounting and auditing system.&#13;
3.9   Community Project Committee (CPC). To manage project activities,&#13;
communities will elect a CPC, consisting of a chairperson, secretary, treasurer and deputy&#13;
secretary supported by elected committee members; the composition of the latter may&#13;
vary by community. The CPC will prepare, manage and supervise the subprojects and&#13;
contract-out tasks on behalf of the community.&#13;
3.10 Sectoral Line Ministries. The ministries will have the responsibility, through&#13;
their desk officers, to ensure that adequate budgetary provisions have been made for&#13;
meeting recurrent expenditures arising from projects approved by them for MASAF&#13;
funding. Ministry personnel at district and community levels will provide technical&#13;
supervision to the sub-projects.&#13;
Public Works Program Structure&#13;
3.11 National Level. The MASAF PWD will be staffed by a Public Works Co-&#13;
ordinator, who will report directly to the MASAF Manager, and by a Technical Officer&#13;
(civil works engineer). The PWD will receive support from the MU Administration&#13;
Division for personnel and other administrative needs, from the Finance Division for&#13;
accounting, disbursements and auditing, and from the Management Information System&#13;
office for information systems and reporting. Under the authority of the MASAF manager&#13;
and with the policy guidance of the PSC, the PWD will be responsible for: (a) annual&#13;
targeting of the public works, (b) appraisal of proposals for public works (c) funding and&#13;
supervision, (d) liaison with the national ministries to organise their input in the program&#13;
with regard to supervision and development of procedures, and (e) monitoring and&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
3.12 National/Regional Linkages. Desk officers will be responsible for MASAF-&#13;
related work in relevant ministries who will work with the PWD to ensure that district&#13;
level officials support public works projects as part of their routine job responsibilities&#13;
and that the projects follow national guidelines approved by the PSC. The&#13;
representatives of the ministries at the national or regional level will assist MASAF staff&#13;
in the routine supervision of the technical, administrative and financial performance of&#13;
public works in the districts.&#13;
3.13 District Level. The program will be implemented by the District Team&#13;
comprising the District Commissioner, the Council Clerk and the Work Supervisors of&#13;
the MOW. The District Team will be responsible for: (a) identifying projects in&#13;
consultation with communities, local leaders, extension workers and NGOs; (b)&#13;
identifying an agency for preparing and executing the projects identified--these agencies&#13;
may include the Ministry of Works at the District level, NGOs or other private agencies,&#13;
(c) preparing the identified projects; (d) submitting project proposals to the MASAF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
Manager for seeking PSC's approval and funding; (e) implementing projects in the&#13;
district; (f) supervising monitoring and evaluating projects; (g) preparing monthly&#13;
financial reports and quarterly progress reports; and (h) informing local stakeholder; from&#13;
time-to-time about progress. Note the two-layer supervision arrangement in the&#13;
component--one in which district staff supervises the work of their subordinates: the other&#13;
where private consultants and the regional and national staff of the Ministry check the&#13;
quality and quantity of work done. The dual supervision is applicable in cases where&#13;
implementation is carried out by public agencies as well as those where small contractors&#13;
are hired to execute the works. Detailed functions of the team members are described in&#13;
Annex 15.&#13;
3.14 Community Level. Once a project has been identified, the beneficiary&#13;
community will constitute a CPC which will (a) assist the Task Force or NGO in&#13;
preparing the proposal; (b) brief communities on project details, including wage rate,&#13;
amount of work to be undertaken by each worker in a day, mode of payment, etc.; (c)&#13;
supervise the time-keeper and check the attendance record; (d) sign the labor attendance&#13;
register and wage bill and payment records; and (e) settle conflicts on project sites.&#13;
Poverty Monitoring Support Facility Structure&#13;
3.15 The Technical Working Committee (TWC), whose members are given in&#13;
paragraph 2.25, will continue to guide the development and design of a national system to&#13;
monitor poverty'5. The particular activities to be financed under the PMSF will be&#13;
specified in annual work programs prepared by the TWC and agreed with IDA at the&#13;
beginning of each annual period. The MASAF MU will disburse PMSF funds as per the&#13;
agreed annual work program (para: 5.1 (c)), training plan (Annex 18) and procedures&#13;
recorded in the MASAF Financial Manual.&#13;
3.16 The TWC has set up an IHSP sub-committee to guide the development of the&#13;
Integrated Household Survey Program at the NSO. The IHSP will be implemented by the&#13;
NSO. The TWC will also set up a Poverty Analysis (PA) sub-committee to improve&#13;
coordination and use of poverty-related research. The PA sub-committee will function as&#13;
a technical advisory committee for studies to be financed under the PMSF.16 The sub-&#13;
comiiiittee will reject or recommend study proposals for TWC approval and PMSF&#13;
funding according to agreed criteria and recommendations from technical reviewers. The&#13;
PA sub-committee will assist in: (i) appraising study proposals, (ii) identifying data&#13;
sources relevant to the study proposal, (iii) advising researchers and reviewers on&#13;
methodological and analytical issues, (iv) monitoring progress of implementation of&#13;
studies and assisting wherever possible in resolving implementation problems (e.g. by&#13;
organizing research seminars). In the program of poverty analysis, the MASAF MU will&#13;
5  The secretariat for the TWC is the Poverty Monitoring Unit in MEP&amp;D.&#13;
16  In order to facilitate the functioning of the program for poverty analysis, the TWC may, at a later&#13;
date, identify the need for technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
initiate and develop the terms of reference for the MASAF Beneficiary Assessments to be&#13;
undertaken in a yearly cycle. The terms of reference will be submitted to the TWC for&#13;
their inputs and comments, revised accordingly and then put to tender. The BA team will&#13;
report on findings to the TWC and the MASAF MU.&#13;
PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
Project Cost&#13;
3.17  The project is expected to be implemented over a five-year period, and it is&#13;
expected that funding for community programs will be fully committed within four and a&#13;
half years. The estimated cost of the project is US$71.32 million, including&#13;
contingencies, with IDA financing US$56 million, which is about 78.5 percent of the&#13;
total. Community Subprojects account for US$48.03 million, or about 68 percent of total&#13;
project cost. The Public Works Program component amounts to approximately US$19.47&#13;
million, about 27 percent of total project cost. Poverty Monitoring amounts to US$1.51&#13;
million, about 2 percent of total project costs, and administration amounts to US$2.31&#13;
million, around 3 percent of total project costs. Table 3.1 gives a summary of total&#13;
project costs by component, and as a percentage of the total.&#13;

3.18 Recurrent Costs of the CSP will be provided by the Ministry of Finance directly,&#13;
or through sectoral ministries, or by communities through their contributions to a&#13;
maintenance fund. The DEC, at the desk appraisal stage, has the responsibility to assess&#13;
each sector's ability to meet the recurrent costs which would be generated by the&#13;
subprojects. For education, teachers are already employed and the Malawi Primary&#13;
Education Project has provision for textbooks, slates, chalk and other consumable.&#13;
Recurrent cost expenditures for education materials are being provided by donors through&#13;
grant funds. For subprojects in water and economic infrastructure, communities' ability&#13;
to establish a contributory fund for financing operating and maintenance costs will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
assessed at desk appraisal and field appraisal and is one of the selection criteria. For&#13;
subprojects in the health sector, recurrent costs will be the responsibility of the line&#13;
ministry, MOHP.&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
3.19  The Project will be financed by the Government, communities, WFP and IDA. A&#13;
proposed IDA credit of US$56 million will cover about 78.5 percent of total project cost,&#13;
with approximately 64 percent of the IDA funds being dedicated to the support of CSP,&#13;
30 percent for PWP, 4 percent for administration, and 2 percent for PMSF. WFP&#13;
contributed approximately 1 percent of the total project cost during the piloting phase; the&#13;
beneficiary communities (through their contributions to subprojects) and the GOM are&#13;
expected to contribute approximately 20 percent of the total project cost. Government is&#13;
expected to contribute toward the Project through provision of salaries to public service&#13;
staff, who will be supervising activities under the Community Subprojects, as well as the&#13;
Public Works Program. In addition, GOM will contribute 5 per cent of incremental&#13;
operating costs in the first year and 10 percent in subsequent years (see table 3.4). A&#13;
detailed determination of the investment items cannot be made a priori, as this depends&#13;
on the selection of various projects by the communities. Indicative sources of funding are&#13;
given in Table 3.2.&#13;

PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.20  The main objective of this Project is poverty alleviation. Successful&#13;
implementation of this Project will entail flexibility in the application of IDA&#13;
procurement norms. Procurement procedures will be adapted to reflect the low unit cost&#13;
and demand-driven nature of the activities to be financed. The procurement guidelines&#13;
are described in the PCD and PIM prepared by GOM, and conform to the Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995. The Bank-Financed&#13;
Projects with Community Participation: A Manualfor Designing Procurement and&#13;
Disbursement Mechanisms (AFTCB, World Bank) has also been consulted. Precise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
figures cannot be provided at this time, because the exact mix of goods and services&#13;
which will be funded for the CSP is not yet known, however, piloting activities have been&#13;
used as an indication of the types of subprojects, and the kinds of related goods and&#13;
services, which will be funded by this component. The Financial and Administrative&#13;
Manuals of MASAF have been used during piloting to guide procurement; the&#13;
experiences and revisions necessary to ensure clarity, simplicity, effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency will continually be incorporated in the document. Staff with responsibility for&#13;
implementation at MU have been trained in IDA procurement procedures and will&#13;
continue to receive guidance from the Task Manager, the Resident Mission, as well as the&#13;
Department's Procurement Unit, as necessary. IDA has appraised the MU's capacity to&#13;
manage procurement and found it fully satisfactory. Procurement processes will be&#13;
reviewed from time to time, as experience accumulates, and processes will be updated in&#13;
consultation with IDA, with a section in the MU's annual report being devoted to issues&#13;
relating to procurement, particularly as these relate to the CSP and PWP (see paras 3.37-&#13;
3.40).&#13;
3.21  To ensure cost savings, contracts for supplies and equipment will be packaged and&#13;
procured by the MU, as appropriate. To encourage community participation in the CSP&#13;
component, communities will manage these subprojects purchasing services of skilled&#13;
laborers and materials locally to ensure minimal delay, as bulk procurement of these&#13;
items would result in delays and inefficiencies. These contracts are small in value and&#13;
scattered in nature and would not attract established civil works contractors. Depending&#13;
on the type and estimated value of the contracts, one of the following methods will be&#13;
specified for each procurement.&#13;
3.22 International Competitive Bidding (ICB) shall be carried out in accordance&#13;
with IDA Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January&#13;
1995, for civil works contracts in excess of US$500,000 equivalent and for goods&#13;
contracts in excess of US$ 100,000. From pilot experiences, it is expected that these will&#13;
consist largely of contracts for boreholes, which will be procured by the MU to maximize&#13;
economies of scale. Domestic preference will be used where applicable in these&#13;
procurements, as stipulated in the IDA Guidelines. IDA Standard Bidding Documents will&#13;
be usedfor ICB(see para 5.2 (c)).&#13;
3.23  National Competitive Bidding (NCB) shall be carried out for goods such as&#13;
equipment, furniture and supplies estimated to cost more than US$30,000 equivalent, and&#13;
up to and including US$100,000 equivalent, per contract, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$300,000 equivalent. For civil works, NCB shall be used for contracts above&#13;
USS30,000 equivalent and up to and including US$500,000 equivalent. The aggregate&#13;
amount for civil works related activities using NCB shall not exceed US$10.3 million&#13;
equivalent, which will largely consist of construction relating to health infrastructure&#13;
under Subprojects and construction of bridges under PWP. NCB bidding documents for&#13;
works and goods, currently being used by other IDA projects and previously cleared by&#13;
IDA, will be used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
3.24 Community Participation. To encourage community participation and increase&#13;
project sustainability, communities will be managing the projects and purchasing both&#13;
services of skilled laborers and materials locally to ensure minimal delay, since bulk&#13;
procurement of these items could result in delays and inefficiencies due to loss during&#13;
transport and storage. Standard price lists for materials will be maintained by the MU, be&#13;
updated every three to six months, and be used by communities as price ceilings for those&#13;
items. Subprojects costing up to $30,000 equivalent per project and US$27.2 million&#13;
equivalent in aggregate would be implemented through self-help projects, which MASAF&#13;
would contract out through the Community Project Committees to individuals, private&#13;
contractors, NGOs and community-based agencies such as private voluntary associations,&#13;
or Community Development Committees, following procedures detailed in para 2.21.&#13;
Such implementing agencies selected on criteria established in the Subprojects PIM, will&#13;
use community labor and will purchase goods or materials through methods prescribed in&#13;
their contract agreement, (a sample of which is included in the PIM) signed with the&#13;
communities. Communities will hire contractors of the required skill level, which pre-&#13;
determines their wage rates, and procure materials and supplies by obtaining quotes from&#13;
three suppliers, when available, and selecting the supplier with the lowest cost who&#13;
fulfills their requirements. MASAF will disburse funds to the communities in tranches&#13;
against certified completion. PWP labor intensive works estimated to cost $30,000&#13;
equivalent or less per contract and US$14.5 million in aggregate would be implemented&#13;
by public agencies through labor contracts with local communities and through contracts&#13;
with qualified local village contractors selected to the extent possible on the basis of at&#13;
least three quotations. When not enough qualified local contractors are available, public&#13;
agencies may resort to direct contracting with a local village contractor on the basis of&#13;
prices periodically published by MASAF.&#13;
3.25 Consultant Services will be procured following IDA guidelines on the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency&#13;
(1981). The aggregate amount for consultant services will be US$2.81 million&#13;
equivalent, and will cover technical assistance, workshops, studies such as beneficiary&#13;
assessments and training activities for CSP and PMSF. The use of the sample letter for&#13;
recruitment of consultants will be required (see para 5.2 (c)).&#13;
3.26  National Shopping. Prudent shopping for contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$30,000 equivalent, up to an aggregated amount of US$500,000 equivalent may be&#13;
used for goods to include equipment, vehicles, furniture and supplies, and transport.&#13;
3.27 The procurement plan agreed with IDA at negotiations (see Annex 13 and para:&#13;
5.1(b) ), and the procurement arrangements summarized in Table 3.3 will be implemented&#13;
in accordance with the procedures outlined here, in the Procurement Schedule given in&#13;
the PIM (Annex 3), and the Development Credit Agreement.&#13;

3.28 IDA Review. All subprojects with procurement for works contracts of&#13;
US$500,000 equivalent or more and goods contracts of US$100,000 equivalent or more&#13;
each will be subject to prior review by IDA (see para 2.12). IDA will review the&#13;
procurement arrangements for other projects proposed by GOM, including contract&#13;
packaging, and applicable procedures, appropriate documents, evaluation reports and&#13;
proposed contract awards for their conformity with the Guidelines. All ICB packages&#13;
will be submitted for prior-review by IDA. A prior review will take place for the first&#13;
two works procurements under NCB and the first two goods procurements under NCB.&#13;
All other contracts will be subject to random post-review. All relevant documentation&#13;
will be retained by the MU so that post reviews can be conducted as required. For&#13;
consulting services, prior review of documentation would be required for: (i) contracts&#13;
with consulting firms with an estimated value of US$100,000 or more; (ii) contracts with&#13;
individuals of US$50,000 or more; (iii) all sole source selections of consulting firms; (iv)&#13;
terms of reference for all contracts regardless of value; (v) critical assignments; and (vi)&#13;
amendments to contracts with consulting firms and individuals that result in revised&#13;
values greater than US$100,000 and US$50,000 respectively.&#13;
DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.29  It is estimated that the IDA credit will be disbursed over 5 years, from July 1996&#13;
through June 2001. Procurement will be completed by June 30, 2001, which will be the&#13;
completion date; December 31, 2001 will be the closing date. The proposed allocation of&#13;
the credit is shown in Table 3.4. Reimbursement for subprojects will be made on&#13;
evidence of disbursements from the MU to Community Project Committees, for the&#13;
PWP, reimbursements will be made on evidence of direct transfer of funds to the District&#13;
Council accounts. IDA will not finance taxes; to ensure this, IDA will only finance 95&#13;
percent of amounts paid by MASAF under Subprojects, 95 percent local expenditures on&#13;
PWP, 90 percent of local expenditures on equipment and supplies, and 95 percent of local&#13;
expenditure on incremental operating costs during FY1996/97 and 90 per cent in&#13;
subsequent years. Communities and GOM will contribute an estimated 20 percent of&#13;
total project costs. GOM's indirect contribution, which includes salaries of technical staff&#13;
doing desk and field appraisal as well as technical supervision of PWP, is estimated at&#13;
US$0.7 million equivalent per year over the life of the project.&#13;

3.30  To ensure that the availability of counterpart funding will not be a bottleneck to&#13;
implementation, GOM agreed during negotiations to open a Project Account with a&#13;
Commercial Bank acceptable to IDA and deposit therein, on a quarterly basis (para 5.2&#13;
(d)), its contribution. Prior to Board Presentation GOM will be required to deposit its&#13;
estimated contribution for the first quarter amounting to Mkl.9 million into MASAF's&#13;
Project Account for that purpose (5.3 (a)). Responsibility for maintaining records of this&#13;
will rest with the MU and these records will be available for IDA review during&#13;
implementation review missions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.31  Incremental operating costs include those costs necessary for the operation of the&#13;
MU, including, but not limited to: salaries, benefits, office supplies, fuel and maintenance&#13;
of motor vehicles, maintenance of equipment, telephone and other communication&#13;
charges, office rent and other administrative charges.&#13;
3.32 All applications to withdraw proceeds from the credit will be fully documented,&#13;
except for (a) expenditures of contracts with an estimated value of US$500,000 each or&#13;
less for civil works, and (b) US$100,000 or less for goods, consulting firms, training,&#13;
workshops and studies, and (c) US$50,000 or less for individual consultants and all&#13;
incremental operating costs, which may be claimed on the basis of certified statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOE). Documentation supporting expenditures claimed against SOEs will&#13;
be retained by the MU and will be available for review when requested by IDA&#13;
supervision missions and project auditors. Disbursement and withdrawal procedures are&#13;
detailed in the World Bank Disbursement Handbook (1992 edition). All disbursements&#13;
are subject to the conditions of the Development Credit Agreement and the procedures&#13;
defined in the Disbursement Letter.&#13;
3.33  To facilitate disbursements of eligible expenditures for works, goods and services,&#13;
the Government will open a Special Account (SA) in a commercial bank to cover part of&#13;
IDA's share of eligible expenditures to be managed and administered by the MU under&#13;
components A and B of the project. Authorized allocation of the Special Account would&#13;
be US$3 million covering an estimated four months of eligible expenditures financed by&#13;
IDA. Upon effectiveness, 50 percent of the authorized allocation, amounting to US$1.5&#13;
million will be deposited to the Special Account. The remaining balance will be made&#13;
available as needed. The MU will be responsible for submitting monthly replenishment&#13;
applications with appropriate supporting documents for expenditures. To the extent&#13;
possible, all IDA's share of eligible expenditures should be paid through the Special&#13;
Account. Estimated disbursements by IDA fiscal year are shown in Table 3.5. Estimated&#13;
disbursements by semester are given in Annex 16.&#13;

ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
3.34  It was agreed during Negotiations that as soon as possible after the end of the&#13;
Malawi financial year, but no later than six months after its completion, GOM will,&#13;
through the MU, present audit reports of the special accounts and the project accounts&#13;
with a separate opinion on the use of the special account and SOEs (para 5.2 (g)). The&#13;
audits will be carried out by the Auditor General. In auditing the project accounts,&#13;
special attention would be paid to verifying the reliability of SOEs, and to the internal&#13;
controls and procedures involved in the preparation of SOEs. Audit reports should be&#13;
produced for each component, covering the use of SOEs, management of the special&#13;
account and other matters. The audit report for the community initiatives component&#13;
shall include a review of Community Project Committee's performance on a sample&#13;
basis. In view of the fact that the project would have a large number of accounts&#13;
including those at the MU, zone and community levels, and that these would need to be&#13;
checked periodically, it was agreed that MASAF will (i) appoint no later than 90 days&#13;
from effectiveness of the credit, (a) an internal auditor who will report directly to the&#13;
MASAF Manager, and (b) consultants to carry out training of MASAF finance staff for&#13;
strengthening the computerization of MASAF's accounting system; and (ii) prepare the&#13;
terms of reference for both the MASAF internal auditor and the above mentioned&#13;
consultants as a condition of Board presentation&#13;
3.35  Project accounts will be established and maintained by GOM. A Special Account&#13;
will be opened for this project and maintained with a commercial bank by GOM. The&#13;
maximum balance in the Special Account will be US$1.5 million, which will cover about&#13;
3 months of expenditures at full operation. There is no need to make the maximum initial&#13;
deposit lower than the maximum balance as is done for project implementing agencies&#13;
with little or no experience in management of Special Accounts.&#13;
MONITORABLE INDICATORS&#13;
3.36  MASAF is a demand-driven project and, as such, will be monitored on a variety&#13;
of indicators using both quantitative and qualitative measures. In addition to process&#13;
indicators, which will be used in all three components and the MU, it is expected that&#13;
PMSF will monitor the impact of not only MASAF interventions, but also activities&#13;
funded by donors, NGOs, as well as GOM. Box 5 contains some indicators which will be&#13;
monitored, and Annex 11 gives a more detailed description of these.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
Box 5: Sample of Indicators to be Monitored&#13;
MU:         number ofprojects processed; time between receipt, approval andfunding&#13;
IEC:        type of messages prepared and vehicle for dissemination; number reached&#13;
Subprojects:  number of mobilized communities; number of women elected;&#13;
types of community contributions; fully accounted-for funds&#13;
PWP:        income earned; activities undertaken--length of road, acreage irrigated&#13;
PMSF:       number of clients using services; review of impact of CSP and PWP, annual&#13;
report on poverty status and social and economic policy.&#13;
Reporting and Reviews&#13;
3.37 During Negotiations,GOM agreed that the MU will coordinate the production of&#13;
an annual report on project implementation (see Annex 17) no later than June 1 of each&#13;
year (para 5.2 (e). Contributions will be made from the MASAF and the PMSF. From&#13;
this review the MU will invite IDA, other interested donors, NGOs and Government&#13;
agencies to an annual review workshop to be held no later than July 1 of every year&#13;
(beginning in 1996 for the year 1995). The implementation review schedule is provided&#13;
in Annex 18.&#13;
3.38 The Manager of MASAF will prepare a consolidated report for submission to the&#13;
PSC quarterly. Copies of the most recent quarterly reports will be sent to IDA before the&#13;
implementation review missions, which are expected to take place bi-annually.&#13;
3.39 A progress report, whose outline was provided and agreed at negotiations, will be&#13;
submitted to IDA annually (para: 5.1(d).&#13;
3.40  During Negotiations,GOM also agreed that a mid-term review will be held 2 years&#13;
after project effectiveness or when 50 percent of funds have been committed, whichever&#13;
occurs first (para 5.2 (f)). For the mid-term review the Government will commission&#13;
independent reviews of each component, including the MU and will summarize the&#13;
findings and recommendation in a report submitted to the donors and IDA before the&#13;
mid-term review. This report will highlight institutional successes and failures of&#13;
MASAF and the MU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
4. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
4.1   Community Benefits. The benefits of the community initiative component of&#13;
the MASAF will be various at many levels. Among these will be:&#13;
(a)   improved health, education and economic infrastructure;&#13;
(b)   improved in service delivery;&#13;
(c)   increased capacities of community-based organizations, district, provincial&#13;
and national government and NGOs to plan, appraise and complete capital&#13;
projects;&#13;
(d)   recognition of the value of self-help in development and maintenance of&#13;
that creation;&#13;
(e)   revived spirit of self-help, increased sense of ownership, and&#13;
accountability, participation in decision making for own development and&#13;
empowerment of implementing communities;&#13;
(f)   creation of income-earning opportunities through employment;&#13;
(g)   improved food availability in food-deficient areas.&#13;
4.2   Poverty Monitoring. The benefits associated with the monitoring activities are:&#13;
(a)   establishment of priority poverty indicators with which to assess changes&#13;
in the living conditions of different social groups;&#13;
(b)   avoidance of duplication of data collection by government agencies;&#13;
(c)   capacity building to generate, process and disseminate household-based&#13;
data;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
(d)   establishment of institutional and financial support for the regular review&#13;
of key poverty indicators to track progress and determine policy&#13;
implications;&#13;
(e)   improved in research capacity; more rigorous and analytical studies with&#13;
appropriate and usable recommendations;&#13;
(f)   establishment of a model, potentially replicable in other African countries,&#13;
for integrating qualitative and participatory approaches into a poverty&#13;
monitoring system at the national level;&#13;
(g)   enhanced capacity within Malawi for participatory research and planning,&#13;
through provision of resources for qualitative and participatory poverty&#13;
studies under the PMSF; and&#13;
(h)   improved targeting of programs and policies, for the poor and vulnerable.&#13;
4.3   Donor Participation. The design of MASAF uses inputs from several donor-&#13;
funded projects. There was constant consultation with donors during preparation. This&#13;
consultation will continue through implementation since there are common activities&#13;
among donor projects even if approach and size may vary. Actual co-financing of the&#13;
project by donors is limited to the WFP joining to finance the food component of the&#13;
PWP. In addition to MASAF financing, funding will be sought from the Norwegians for&#13;
financing poverty monitoring activities.&#13;
PROJECT RISKS&#13;
4.4   The risks to the Project are:&#13;
(a)   That GOM fails to adhere to economic reform programs. The Government&#13;
and IDA have continued their dialogue: GOM has implemented most of&#13;
the conditions, such as operating on a cash basis. The following have been&#13;
taken into consideration in the project design to minimize the impact that&#13;
recurrent costs from this project might have on the GOM budget: (i)&#13;
teachers are already on the payroll of the GOM budget; (ii) the ability of&#13;
communities to set up maintenance funds for water and social&#13;
infrastructure projects is one criterion for selection; (iii) the health sector&#13;
representative at the district level has to be assured that there are funds in&#13;
the MOHP budget to cover recurrent costs of any proposed health center.&#13;
(b)   That community self-help spirit may be undermined by other programs&#13;
and projects not using the same clear criteria in project selection nor&#13;
insisting on self-help. The Project will assist GOM in the development&#13;
and implementation of a policy which would eliminate this risk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
(c)   That since the management of funds for CSP will be the responsibility of&#13;
the community, there may be accountability lapses. To minimize this risk,&#13;
decision making at the community level has been made transparent and&#13;
participatory, and the CPC members are to be trained in book keeping.&#13;
(d)   That poor technical quality of the works could undermine the&#13;
sustainability of the CSP and PWP projects, which may also undermine&#13;
community participation. This is being addressed by significant technical&#13;
monitoring and supervision. The project implementation work-book will&#13;
be made available to all Community Project Committees. District Officers&#13;
will be trained in technical appraisal skills to ensure better quality at entry&#13;
(e)   That communities are over-stretched and overwhelmed by the demands on&#13;
them from all sectors, thus putting a capacity constraint on them. Donors&#13;
(European Union, USAID, Overseas Development Agency (ODA) and&#13;
United Nations Development Program (UNDP)) and NGOs such as Save&#13;
the Children (UK), Action Aid - have expressed this view. Communities&#13;
are expected to perform functions for which they have neither the skills&#13;
nor the capacity, for example, to maintain accounts and financial records,&#13;
to identify and recruit facilitators like NGOs and then pay them. Pilot&#13;
experience does not confirm this nor does other experience with&#13;
community-driven projects. Community implementation capacity is an&#13;
important factor in subproject selection, which will be monitored&#13;
throughout.&#13;
(f)   That MU will not be able to respond to the high level of demand as&#13;
expressed by the number of inquiries and requests currently being received&#13;
by the MASAF. Unrealistic expectations on the part of GOM and the&#13;
communities as to the numbers and types of projects which can be&#13;
implemented could have a negative impact on MASAF's reputation.&#13;
Piloting has allowed the MU to work through the processes, and lessons&#13;
learned have been incorporated into the PIM. IEC campaigns will be&#13;
mounted, to inform the public of the status of these activities.&#13;
(g)   That the flatter management structure adopted under the PWP to allow&#13;
greater transparency, may also promote weaker ownership of the project&#13;
than might be the case in a single ministry-managed project. There is&#13;
uncertainty as to where the balance of gain would lie.&#13;
(h)   That the budget for tools in the PWP has been kept low because the&#13;
preparation team could not develop a fully accountable system for&#13;
distributing tools to laborers and ensuring the return of tools after the work&#13;
is over. This might constrain speedy implementation. The piloting&#13;
lessons are expected to throw further light on this issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
(i)   That GOM fails to meet its basic commitments to service provision at&#13;
district level because of budgetary constraints. This would deprive the&#13;
project of the appraisal capability and routine supervision subsumed in&#13;
community projects.&#13;
4.5   The risks associated with the National Sample Survey of&#13;
Agriculture/VAM/Famine Early Warning System are:&#13;
(a)   technical capacity may be inadequate to sustain the component once the&#13;
external support (USAID, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)) is&#13;
withdrawn; and&#13;
(b)   that the NSO and MOAg budgets may not provide adequate resources for&#13;
effective implementation of data collection and analysis, reducing the&#13;
credibility of the instruments.&#13;
4.6   The risk associated with the PMSF component is that the local research&#13;
community cannot avail itself of the resources under the program of poverty analysis&#13;
because of constraints in skilled capacity. This risk has been tackled by creating scope&#13;
for collaboration between local and external researchers, and by maintaining that the&#13;
preparation and dissemination of studies be part of capacity building.&#13;
4.7   A final risk to the smooth implementation of the Project would be the possibility&#13;
of Government yielding to pressures from Donors to modify procedures. Slow&#13;
disbursements, erratic release of funds by the Reserve Bank, and burdensome reporting&#13;
requirements may hamper implementation. This risk will be dealt with by ensuring that&#13;
sufficient funding is available to the MU from IDA and Government sources. This has&#13;
been dealt with during preparation, by ensuring that other donors' experiences have been&#13;
incorporated into the project design.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
PROJECT VIABILITY&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
4.8   Sustainability. The MU and its field offices will be coterninous with the&#13;
Project, but the principles of community contribution, procedures to involve communities&#13;
in projects and criteria developed to support community initiatives will be retained. The&#13;
MASAF approach would be adopted in regular sectoral programs of the Government.&#13;
The skills learnt by communities during the project in using and accounting for funds,&#13;
building, maintaining and rehabilitating infrastructure will be sustained by them. The&#13;
transfer of skills to district staff, especially in the appraisal, implementation and&#13;
monitoring of projects will help sustain the MASAF processes and approach. It is&#13;
probable that at mid-term review of this project, the District Development Fund would&#13;
have been established in each district and that sufficient experience in implementing&#13;
projects would have accumulated, which would allow the DDC to gradually assume the&#13;
function of the MU, adopting the MASAF approach, processes and project selection&#13;
criteria. Adoption by sectors of the MASAF approach generally for community-based&#13;
activities and transferning functions of the MU to the district levels would be two&#13;
important issues to be addressed at the time of the mid-term review.&#13;
4.9   Completed CSP and PWP Schemes. The sustainability of the CSP is assured&#13;
because the community implementing the project has contributed substantially to it and&#13;
has an increased sense of ownership. Every subproject would have an established and&#13;
functioning maintenance committee. Since sectoral ministries have been involved in the&#13;
development, appraisal, and supervision of the subprojects, and have promised to provide&#13;
manpower to run the facilities created and to meet other necessary recurrent costs, the&#13;
maintenance of service delivery is assured. As to the PWP projects, these will clearly&#13;
increase demand for maintenance funds. However, since PWP is seen as a safety net&#13;
intervention, future maintenance activities could also be undertaken as part of the&#13;
program. Government's own budgetary resources will be phased-in gradually so that&#13;
assets created are maintained.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
4.10 MASAF is a demand-driven project. Actual distribution of funds by type of&#13;
activity is not known ex ante. The estimated distribution of projects and funds by type of&#13;
activity is based on the results of the first 25 pilots which were financed during&#13;
September, 1995 and January, 1996. The ERR for Education refers to primary education&#13;
and does not include externalities; the ERR for water and public works refers to simple&#13;
activities such as boreholes and earth/gravel roads (expected to be the predominant&#13;
activity) we assume that the community will be able to carry out maintenance without&#13;
cost to the government. The total ERR is about 22 percent and reflects the ERR of the&#13;
individual sector activities, weighted by their expected relative incidence. We have not&#13;
calculated the ERR for activities in health, miscellaneous economic infrastructure and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
poverty monitoring/administration, which are expected to account for about one fifth&#13;
percent of project cost. Even if we assign an ERR of "O" to these activities, the weighted&#13;
average is still satisfactory at nearly 18 percent. In health, the project is expected to&#13;
finance the construction of primary level infrastructure (rural health clinics and posts)&#13;
which tend to carry out interventions in the higher end of the cost effectiveness spectrum&#13;
(EPI, rehydration therapy, malaria treatment, TBA ante-natal and delivery care, etc.).&#13;
Such interventions, which are normally carried out at the primary level of care, tend to&#13;
favor primarily women and children and are expected to yield substantial gains in life-&#13;
years saved. The main risk involved with this project relates to institutional deficiencies,&#13;
which might delay project implementation. Even if these delays result in a 15 percent&#13;
decrease in benefits accruing to the project and a 15 percent increase in costs, the&#13;
weighted average ERR is reduced to about 18 percent--still a satisfactory outcome. (see&#13;
Schedule B of the Memorandum to the President).&#13;

implementation not later than July 1 of each year (beginning in 1996 for&#13;
the year 1995), on the basis of appropriate documentation to be prepared&#13;
by the MU which will include the work programs and budgets for the three&#13;
components for the following year (para 3.37);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
(f)   GOM will: (i) carry out jointly with IDA, a mid-term review of the&#13;
progress of the project not later than July 1, 1999 or when 50 percent of&#13;
the funds are committed, whichever occurs first; (ii) submit to IDA the&#13;
findings of independent reviews of each of the three components,&#13;
including the MU, and summarize the findings and recommendations in a&#13;
report submitted to the donors and IDA before mid-term review; and (iii)&#13;
implement the recommendations of the review (para 3.40);&#13;
(g)   GOM will submit to IDA, within six months after the end of each fiscal&#13;
year, audit reports as follows: (i) financial audits annually, with audit&#13;
reviewing internal controls and procedures involved in the preparation of&#13;
the SOEs, and (ii) technical and management audits (para 3.34); and&#13;
(h)   A unit cost data bank will be maintained and updated (every three to six&#13;
months) to monitor the cost of materials, goods, works and services which&#13;
the communities buy for use under the project (para 3.5).&#13;
5.3   As Conditions of Board Presentation, GOM through MASAF MU has:&#13;
(a)   established a Project Account into which the estimated GOM contribution&#13;
to the Project will be deposited quarterly, and deposited the estimated&#13;
contribution for the first quarter (para 3.30); and&#13;
(b)   submitted terms of reference, acceptable to IDA, for appointment of an&#13;
internal auditor for the duration of the project and technical assistance for&#13;
the training of accounts staff in MASAF in computerized accounting (para&#13;
3.34).&#13;
5.4   Recommendation. Given the preceding actions, conditions and agreements, the&#13;
proposed project would be suitable for an IDA credit of SDR 38 million (US$56 million&#13;
equivalent).&#13;

SELECTION CRITERIA FOR COMMUNITY SUBPROJECTS&#13;
Community subproject selection criteria will emphasize demonstration of active&#13;
community involvement, contribution and management, and gender sensitivity. In order to&#13;
qualify, projects would have to meet the following criteria:&#13;
*  be community-based;&#13;
*  involve simple technology, manageable by communities;&#13;
*  serve poverty reduction objectives;&#13;
*  demonstrate community involvement, ensuring ownership and maintenance by the&#13;
communities;&#13;
*  be identified, prepared and managed by the communities;&#13;
* be financed by disbursements made directly from MASAF; it is expected that direct&#13;
disbursement to communities would promote skills for ownership and community&#13;
empowerment, necessary ingredients for project sustainability;&#13;
*  be cofinanced by the communities in the form of self-help contributions; and&#13;
*  assets will be located in public or communal land, or land belonging to local bodies;&#13;
where the location proposed is private land (freehold or leasehold), appropriate&#13;
written contract between owners of the land and beneficiaries ensuring unlimited and&#13;
unimpeded access by beneficiaries, shall be presented; a copy of the contract will be&#13;
made available to beneficiary, and another filed in MASAF documents..&#13;

PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM SELECTION CRrTERIA AND&#13;
PRINCIPLES OF IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
The following selection criteria will apply to the selection of public works activities:&#13;
* cannot be undertaken on a self-help basis because of nature and size;&#13;
* unskilled labor component is a significant portion of the total cost;&#13;
* implementation will not require specialized technical inputs and procedures; activities&#13;
can be started in a short time; and&#13;
* total cost of each project will not exceed MKI .5 million.&#13;
Principles of Implementation&#13;
The principles that have guided the design of the PW component are:&#13;
(A)  Accountability tIransparency&#13;
* The agency that maintains labor records will not make wage payments. A separate&#13;
agency/office will make payments to the laborers. Similarly, where material is to be&#13;
procured, the person who prepares the bill of material will not be the person who makes&#13;
the actual purchase. Using the bill prepared, procurement will be the responsibility of&#13;
another agency.&#13;
* A labor attendance register will be maintained by a project committee constituted for&#13;
each work. This committee will comprise representatives of the communitfies where the&#13;
work will be done. The project committee will record attendance daily. This will be&#13;
applicable in both work systems being proposed: (i) direct labor supervision by the&#13;
implementing agency and (ii) minor contract method (see D). The attendance statement&#13;
will be signed by the work supervisor and at least two committee members. This&#13;
register will be available for verification by all visiting supervisors.&#13;
* Labor attendance records and bills of material will be signed at least by two members of&#13;
the project committee. Copies of wage payment statements and material delivery&#13;
documents will be made available to the project committee.&#13;
* Decisions will be made through group consultation to the extent possible.&#13;
(B) Wages&#13;
The wage rate will be established at the national level with reference to the minimum wage for rural&#13;
areas. The present wage is MK7.50 per person/day. Work norms for individual labor will be&#13;
specified and made known to all participants in the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
(C) Timing of Activities:&#13;
The timing of public works will be determined by demand.&#13;
(D) Organisation of Works-Private Contractors&#13;
The works will be organised both through direct work supervision and minor contract methods.&#13;
Indirectly supervised works, the works supervisor or the concerned official will maintain labor&#13;
attendance records as required under existing procedures. The quantity of works would be&#13;
measured and recorded according to existing national guidelines.&#13;
The DRIMP minor contract system will be adopted to the PWP where MOW direct supervision&#13;
capacity at the district is inadequate. In such cases, piece works can be farmed-out through a&#13;
written arrangement, which will be co-signed by project committee members, the supervisor and&#13;
the council clerk. A copy of this contract will be attached to the labor register being maintained at&#13;
the community level. Generally, work to be contracted-out should be in small quantities so that&#13;
implementation can be monitored effectively. Several minor contracts can be farmed-out over time&#13;
within a single project MOW district staff will be trained, to manage such minor contracts.&#13;
(E) Private Sector Participation in Supervision. While executive agency at the district level will&#13;
carry out its own systematic supervision, MASAF will ensure in addition that supervision from&#13;
regional and national level is also carried out by: (i) MOW regional and national staff, (ii) private&#13;
consultants hired by MOW where the ministry has capacity constraints, and (iii) MASAF Public&#13;
Works Division (PWD). Each ongoing work will be supervised by one or more of these three&#13;
agencies once a month to measure and report the quantity and quality of work carried out. These&#13;
supervision teams will also check information in the labor register and discuss with the community&#13;
members the manner in which the work is being implemented. Each such supervisory team will&#13;
submit a detailed report of its inspection to the District Team and to the MASAF. (A detailed&#13;
format for supervision report will be designed).&#13;
(F) Sustainability. The Goveniment will gradually phase-in regular public resources to continue&#13;
the program beyond the life of the project. The communities may not be able to maintain the assets&#13;
by self-help unassisted. Maintenance can be one of the public works activities.&#13;
(G) Gender Concerns: The project will lay emphasis on employment to women. An effort will&#13;
be made to recruit women for employment in works. In Machinga, for example, the communities&#13;
decided that each labor gang consisting of 9 persons would have 6 women. Modalities for&#13;
enhancing benefits for women will be examined continuously to accommodate as many women as&#13;
possible.&#13;

I   This does not include employment of skilled workers (such as masons) or employment generated in the making of&#13;
items in the material component, such as laying bricks.&#13;
2    Since the mix of irrigation and road works would be determined as the project progresses, the quantity of assets built&#13;
is expressed in terms of road-miles equivalent. The average cost per mile is taken to be the average in the pilots, and&#13;
the exchange rate is assumed to be $S=MKI5. The wage rate and labor cost assumed are those in the pilots.&#13;
3   Experience from the pilots show that a person recruited initially does not vacate the job. Since PWP works create&#13;
about 100 days of employment every year on the project sites it is assumed that each participating household sends&#13;
only one member of the family who works for 100 days in a year.&#13;
4    An average household size of 5 members is assumed.&#13;

Institutional Arrangements and Study Cycle'&#13;
for&#13;
Studies financed under the Poverty Monitoring Support Facility&#13;
Institutional arrangements&#13;
One of the TWC's tasks is to commission and coordinate analysis of poverty-related&#13;
issues and ensure its dissemination. Accordingly, the TWC will set up a multi-disciplinary sub-&#13;
committee which will serve as a coordinating technical body for poverty-related research. The&#13;
sub-committee will consist of members of the TWC and include assigned PMU personnel. The&#13;
terrns of reference for this Poverty Analysis (PA) sub-committee will be defined by the TWC.&#13;
As a part of its tasks, the PA sub-committee will appraise studies to be funded from&#13;
PMSF resources. The PA sub-committee will assist in: (i) appraising study proposals, (ii)&#13;
identifying data sources relevant to the study proposal, (iii) advising researchers and reviewers&#13;
on methodological and analytical issues, (iv) monitoring progress of implementation of studies&#13;
and assist wherever possible in resolving implementation problems (e.g. by organizing research&#13;
seminars).&#13;
*  The PA sub-committee will assign reviewers and reject or recommend studies for&#13;
TWC approval according to pre-agreed criteria and recommendations from technical&#13;
reviewers.&#13;
*  The sub-committee is required to report back to the full TWC on the studies&#13;
approved and progress in studies under implementation.&#13;
*  The PA sub-committee will actively involve policy makers in the preparation of&#13;
research proposals as well as the discussions of research findings, so that&#13;
contemporary issues are dealt with. The PA sub-committee will also support and&#13;
encourage use of qualitative as well as quantitative approaches in the studies to be&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
*  The MASAF Beneficiary Assessments will be managed and coordinated with the&#13;
MASAF management unit.&#13;
*  The PMU will be responsible for dissemination of research findings.&#13;
*  In order to facilitate the functioning of the program for poverty analysis, the TWC&#13;
may, at a later date, identify the need for technical assistance.&#13;
It is expected that as it starts functioning, the PA sub-committee will begin to coordinate&#13;
studies to be financed not only through the PMSF, but also by other donors and GOM. This will&#13;
avoid duplication and encourage economies of scale in conducting analysis.&#13;
These institutional arrangements will be reviewed as the sub-committee is established&#13;
and starts functioning.&#13;

ANNEX 12&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Study Cycle for studies financed under the PMSF:&#13;
*  The TWC will decide on priority research areas for small studies. Study proposals in&#13;
the identified priority research areas will be solicited by the PA sub-committee&#13;
through widely-disseminated public announcements twice a year.&#13;
*  The TWC may also commission participatory poverty assessments2, or beneficiary&#13;
assessments or cost-effectiveness/cost-benefit evaluations of targeted interventions.&#13;
Proposals to carry out the commissioned assessments will be solicited by the PA&#13;
sub-committee through widely-disseminated public announcements. When national&#13;
capacity to conduct Beneficiary and Participatory assessments cannot be met, short&#13;
term international assistance will be hired.&#13;
*  The TWC may also commission National Poverty Studies which will typically use&#13;
survey data that are nationally representative and will analyze priority poverty&#13;
indicators at the national, regional, and district level. Proposals to carry out national&#13;
poverty studies will be solicited by the PA sub-committee through widely-&#13;
disseminated public announcements. When capacity to do such analysis cannot be&#13;
met nationally, short term international assistance will be hired.&#13;
*  The studies and analyses supported through the PMSF, together with other relevant&#13;
studies, should be summarized and used to build the Annual Report on status of&#13;
poverty and policy interventions (see above).&#13;
*  Study proposals will be submitted to the PA sub-committee. The proposal will&#13;
describe the objectives, hypothesis, analytical methods to be used, data sources, the&#13;
capability of the research team and the likely outcomes and policy relevance. A&#13;
budget should also be attached. A literature review should be part of the research&#13;
proposal and should reveal gaps in existing research and also identify issues which&#13;
require further research. The PA sub-committee will review the proposals to ensure&#13;
it complies with the selection criteria.&#13;
*  The PA sub-committee will assign two reviewers for each proposal. One of the&#13;
reviewers would be from the relevant institution expected to implement the results of&#13;
the research. Another reviewer would be a technical expert who can assess the&#13;
methodology proposed by the study. After the study has been reviewed and changes&#13;
made to the proposals, the study proposal will be resubmitted to the PA sub-&#13;
committee. At this stage, the sub-committee will select and recommend proposals to&#13;
the TWC for approval.&#13;
*  The reviewers will be expected to support the researcher and the research with study&#13;
seminars and assist with analytical and research issues. The reviewers will make&#13;
monthly reports to the PA sub-committee on progress in implementation of the&#13;
studies. The reviewers will also review the draft study report.&#13;
*  The PA sub-committee will report on in-progress studies to the TWC on a quarterly&#13;
basis. The completed studies are to be discussed by the TWC.&#13;
2Participatory Poverty Assessments may be conducted to investigate the priorities and needs of communities and&#13;
districts that are identified as very poor and may need special attention. The indicators to identify these&#13;
communities would be high morbidity, malnutrition, poor access to facilities and social services and lack of&#13;
community projects.&#13;
&#13;

* The PMU will disseminate results of the completed study to policy makers and&#13;
implementors, donors, NGO's and data collectors by making reports available,&#13;
workshops, seminars, radio programs, etc.&#13;
* Beneficiary Assessments of MASAF community and public works projects would be&#13;
conducted annually and feed into the development of MASAF project management&#13;
and implementation procedures. The MASAF MU will initiate and develop the&#13;
terms of reference for the beneficiary assessments to be undertaken in a yearly cycle.&#13;
The terms of reference will be submitted to the TWC for their inputs and comments,&#13;
revised accordingly and then put to tender. The BA team will report on findings to&#13;
the TWC and the MASAF MU.&#13;

PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ROLES&#13;
Institutions at the district and project area levels&#13;
Functions at the district level&#13;
Public Works Project management will be carried out at the district level through a Public&#13;
Works Team comprising the District Commissioner, the Clerk of the District Council and the Head&#13;
of the appropriate technical department (Ministry of Works or DRIMP for roads projects). Using a&#13;
team approach to public works management will allow each institution to focus on its area of&#13;
expertise and authority and increase transparency and accountability. In pilot tests, the three district&#13;
level offices have worked together smoothly. Although each of the three offices has its specific&#13;
functions, financial control of the project will rest with the three officials who will be collectively&#13;
and individually accountable. The district public works team will:&#13;
* identify projects in consultation with communities, local leaders, extension workers&#13;
and NGOs;&#13;
* prepare the projects identified;&#13;
* submit project proposals to MASAF Steering Committee for approval and funding;&#13;
* implement projects in the district;&#13;
* supervise, monitor and evaluate projects in the district;&#13;
* prepare monthly financial reports and quarterly progress reports.&#13;
I1 he District Commissioner will be responsible for:&#13;
* working with the District Council, technical departments, local leaders, NGOs and&#13;
others to identify, cost, and submit public works proposals to MASAF in accordance&#13;
with the allocations by EPA for a given annual cycle.&#13;
* informing local leaders and communities of approved projects and organizing project&#13;
committees for each project.&#13;
* educating project committees and communities on the scope of employment and works&#13;
planned and the operational issues, and resolving issues related to recruitment,&#13;
payment schedules, etc.&#13;
* working with project committees and other local leaders to resolve problems with&#13;
right-of-way, compensation, etc.&#13;
&#13;

helping to coordinate the work of the District Council staff, technical department staff&#13;
and project committee to ensure smooth implementation of the projects.&#13;
The Clerk of the District Council (working with the District Council Treasurer and other staff)&#13;
will be responsible for:&#13;
*  assisting with costing of project proposals submitted to MASAF;&#13;
* opening and maintaining a special bank account for public works projects (with the&#13;
Clerk of the Council, District Commissioner and technical department representative as&#13;
co-signatories);&#13;
*  drawing up payrolls for unskilled workers using labor register information provided&#13;
through the technical department;&#13;
* preparing annual budgets for administrative expenses reflecting planned/expected sub&#13;
project activities, to ensure that administrative expenses do not exceed the norm laid&#13;
down.&#13;
* making all payments to unskilled workers at project sites or home villages;&#13;
* procuring other goods and services needed by the public works projects and&#13;
transferring these to the technical department;&#13;
- funding authorized administrative expenses in support of the public works projects of&#13;
the District Commissioner, District Council staff and technical department staff;&#13;
- keeping detailed project accounts;&#13;
* preparing the financial and procurement sections of routine progress reports to the&#13;
MASAF PWD.&#13;
The District Head of the Technical Department (usually Ministry of Works/DRIMP) will be&#13;
responsible for:&#13;
*  helping to identify potential public wcrks projects in designated EPAs&#13;
* preparing the technical design of proposed public works projects, ensuring maximum&#13;
unskilled labor content and maintaining adequate quality standards;&#13;
* determining the staff needs, employment rates and schedule for approved public works&#13;
and assisting communities with recruitment of laborers;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
92&#13;
ANNEX 15&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
*  determining the need for allocating portions of the works to small contractors and, with&#13;
the assistance of the regional works office, preparing the tendering, bidding and&#13;
selection of such contractors. These procedures have already been used under a World&#13;
Bank-financed infrastructure project and would need only to be modified slightly for&#13;
use in the public works program.&#13;
*  routine supervision of the technical progress of public works including the quantity and&#13;
quality of the work as specified in standards and plans;&#13;
*  raising requests for procurement of needed tools and materials for public works&#13;
projects;&#13;
*  receipt of tools purchased by the district council and maintenance of tools stock&#13;
records using the regular Ministry of Works system for storage, allocation and&#13;
accountability;&#13;
*  receipt and use of materials purchased through the district council to carry out the&#13;
works;&#13;
*  regular reporting on the physical progress and quality of the works, materials used and&#13;
tools as part of the public works progress report.&#13;
*  assisting MASAF or national and regional supervisors in the technical inspection of&#13;
ongoing and completed works.&#13;
In the event that an NGO identifies and proposes a project, the NGO will carry out the planning and&#13;
implementation of the project in consultation with the district team of officials. Once the project&#13;
has been approved, the NGO will manage the project resources. The NGO will be accountable to&#13;
the District team of officials and the MASAF, who will oversee implementation of the project.&#13;
Functions at the project area level&#13;
Organization of the work at the project area level will involve several actors depending on the&#13;
design of the project. These may include site foremen (generally Roads Foremen), Contractors, and&#13;
Project Committees.&#13;
Site Foremen. For works directly managed, day-to-day supervision is the responsibility of the Site&#13;
Foreman (Roads Foremen in road projects). Following the detailed site design and layout&#13;
determined by the District level technical supervisor, they:&#13;
* organise recruitment of unskilled labor and any intermediate staff needed (such as capitaos&#13;
or clerks) from the community;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93&#13;
ANNEX 15&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
*  assign daily work tasks&#13;
*  oversee skilled labor and the use of materials for needed construction for culverts, bridges,&#13;
etc.&#13;
*  ensure that quantity and quality norms are adhered to&#13;
* report progress and any problems to the district level supervisor&#13;
Contractors Contractors for minor works can be engaged using standard DRIMP procedures and&#13;
can carry out all the functions of the Site Foreman depending on the specifications of the contract.&#13;
Under the DRIMP projects contractors had their work certified by the Ministry of Works and were&#13;
paid according to work completed, without consideration of the details of labor use. However,&#13;
under public works projects the objective of maximising unskilled labor content is important.&#13;
Procedures to ensure that this is done will need to be added to standard contracts, and procedures to&#13;
ensure transparency in unskilled labor payment (section 4.5), such as involving the project&#13;
committee in labor registration and signing-off on payments may be needed. The current&#13;
arrangement will be modified as experience is gained during the first year of programme&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Project Committee Once a project has been identified, the community will form a Project&#13;
Committee. In general, the Committee will have representatives of all villages that will participate&#13;
in the project. The Committee will:&#13;
*   assist the District Public Works Team in preparing project proposals;&#13;
*   brief communities on project details including wage rate, amount of work to be&#13;

Supervision Plan&#13;
The MASAF/MU will carry out routine supervision of implementation of the project and&#13;
will be supported in the process by the IDA team led by the Team Leader. Supervisory functions&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   review of activities listed under the first tranche for CSP and the labor and&#13;
wages registers for the PWP, procurement records and disbursements including&#13;
SOEs;&#13;
(b)    confirmation of adherence to the standard bidding documents for small works,&#13;
motor vehicles, equipment, consultants and project contract documents;&#13;
(c)   review of annual implementation work plans;&#13;
(d)   review of the monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements;&#13;
(e)    preparation and submission of all project implementation annual progress&#13;
reports;&#13;
(f)    arranging for and following up on annual audit reports of project accounts, SOEs&#13;
and management;&#13;
(g)    monitoring of routine implementation and of the key implementation indicators&#13;
agreed at negotiations;&#13;
(h)    preparation for and liaison with the IDA half-yearly supervision mission;&#13;
(i)    preparation for the Mid-term Review of the project.&#13;
In addition to the field supervision specified in Schedule 22, IDA staff will spend at least&#13;
10 staff weeks each year reviewing and commenting on procurement, disbursement, routine&#13;
reports and annual audits and management reports. The workload is expected to be high during&#13;
the early years of project implementation. As this is the first project of its type in Malawi, strong&#13;
support will be needed from the team.&#13;
Activities under the PWP and PMSF are still experimental; the Mid-term Review,&#13;
planned two years after start of implementation, will enable the team to assess physical,&#13;
institutional, process and financial progress against the initial targets agreed during negotiations.&#13;
The outcome of review would be the level of adjustment needed to the components' design for&#13;
the project targets to be achieved by the end of the project life. This estimate of adjustment will&#13;
derive from experience gained on the project.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Social Action Fund Project will
            contribute towards poverty reduction in four fundamental
            ways. It will: 1) provide additional resources for programs
            targeted at the poor; 2) promote a new approach to rural
            development by involving communities in project preparation
            and implementation, while encouraging government agencies,
            non-governmental organizations and private institutions to
            assist communities when needed; 3) support a district level
            program of labor-intensive construction to be targeted at
            the poorest districts as a safety net operation; and 4)
            strengthen the poverty monitoring and assessment system
            through financing a poverty monitoring support facility
            (PMSF). The PMSF will support poverty reduction policies and
            programs by bridging poverty-related gaps and developing
            analytical skills in government and private institutions.
            The project will have the following three components: 1)
            community subprojects including an information, education
            and communication (IEC) campaign to inform communities and
            other participants about the demand-driven processes of the
            project; 2) public works program which will finance a safety
            net operation in poor and food-deficient areas through
            labor-intensive public works constructing, rehabilitating
            and maintaining economic infrastructure; and 3) poverty
            monitoring support facility, which will finance capacity
            building in institutions to coordinate, collect, analyze,
            disseminate and use data relevant for poverty reduction
            policies and programs.
