C. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE&#13;
The Trust Fund is designed as a partnership initiative where agencies who share the vision and&#13;
objectives of the Project are encouraged to participate. The Project started as a partnership&#13;
initiative among the World Bank, the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) and the&#13;
Hewlett Foundation, and subsequently the African Development Bank joined the partnership.&#13;
The governance structure is intended to be inclusive yet nimble, aiming to secure broad buy-in of&#13;
the various stakeholders, with efficient and effective financial and technical oversight.&#13;
The Trust Fund will follow the governance structure as follows:&#13;
1.     Steering Committee and Executive Committee. The Steering Committee and&#13;
Executive Committee play an advisory role for the project to oversee the development and&#13;
implementation of the Project. The roles of the Steering Committee are to: provide guidance&#13;
regarding the overall direction of the Project; promote the use of the Service Delivery Indicators&#13;
in international and national policy processes; ensure high ethical standards, including high&#13;
quality of data collection and integrity in the dissemination of results; and advise on annual work-&#13;
plans prepared by the Project Management Team. The Steering Committee will be composed of&#13;
representatives of: (i) the World Bank Africa Region; (ii) the Hewlett Foundation and other&#13;
donors; (iii) African Economic Research Consortium; (iv) African Development Bank; (v) key&#13;
stakeholders; and (vi) Project Manager (will serve as a Secretary to the Steering Committee). The&#13;
Steering Committee members other than the Bank will serve a predetermined term (unless&#13;
otherwise specified). The Steering Committee will have an Executive Committee that will&#13;
comprise major donors (over a pre-determined threshold contribution level determined by the&#13;
Steering Committee). The Executive Committee will: guide the overall objectives and design of&#13;
the Project and shape the long-term vision of the Project; designate the project management role&#13;
to a capable institution.&#13;
2.     Technical Panel. The panel membership is selected by the Project Management Team&#13;
and reviewed by the Steering Committee. The Technical Panel works closely with the project&#13;
structures on technical issues such as the choice of indicators, survey design and implementation,&#13;
and data use, with special emphasis on quality and technical integrity of the Service Delivery&#13;
Indicators.&#13;
3.     Project Management Team. A Project Management team, led by a Project Manager,&#13;
will: manage the SDI Project activities on a daily basis; independently implement and monitor the&#13;
Project; and oversee the preparation of the SDI Report, the Annual Progress and Financial report&#13;
and any special reports as needed. A Country Advisor will be designated for each country being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-6-&#13;
surveyed, and the advisor will provide support and oversight to the work of the Country&#13;
Implementation Organization in each country. The Project Management Team will be appointed&#13;
by the Bank. The Project will be audited and each donor will be provided with the audit report.&#13;
4.     Country Implementing Organization. The implementing organization (one per&#13;
country) will be responsible for country-level implementation of the Project. The Project&#13;
Management Team shall oversee the selection and procurement of the Country Implementing&#13;
Organizations. The criteria for selecting a Country Implementing Organization will include:&#13;
technical capacity and proven track record of collecting and analyzing survey data; demonstrated&#13;
ability to work constructively with the government and other partners; and other criteria as&#13;
determined by the Project Management Team in consultation with the Steering Committee. The&#13;
Project Management Team provide oversight, quality assurance and technical support to the&#13;
Country Implementation Organization. This support function will be executed by a Country&#13;
Advisor.&#13;
