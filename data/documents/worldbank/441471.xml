Although money laundering is impossible to measure with precision, it is estimated that US$300&#13;
billion to US$500 billion in proceeds from serious crime (not tax evasion) is laundered each year.&#13;
Measures in major financial markets to detect and prosecute laundering are driving it toward less&#13;
developed markets linked to the global financial system. If left unchecked, money laundering could&#13;
criminalize the financial system and undermine development efforts in emerging markets. This&#13;
Note surveys efforts by international bodies to combat money laundering. It looks in particular at&#13;
the Financial Action Task Force based at the OECD, which has made the most continuous effort.&#13;
