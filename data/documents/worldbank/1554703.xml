FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on international capital and economic development.&#13;
Prepared as background papers for World Development Report 1985,&#13;
the series provides more detailed treatment and documentation of&#13;
the issues dealt with In the Report. The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics including a historical perspective on international capital&#13;
and economic development; the effects of policies in industrial&#13;
and developing countries on international capital flows, external&#13;
debt, and economic development; and the role of official&#13;
assistance, commercial bank lending, securities markets, and&#13;
private direct investment in developing countries. Several&#13;
studies of individual developing countries are also included in&#13;
the series.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on World Bank&#13;
policy analysis and research, and on reports of other organ-&#13;
izations working on these issues. The papers are the work of&#13;
individuals and the views and interpretations expressed in them do&#13;
not necessarily coincide with the views and interpretations of the&#13;
Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement World&#13;
Development Report 1985 in furthering understanding of the&#13;
relationship between international capital and economic develop-&#13;
ment. A complete list of the papers appears on the overleaf.&#13;

ABSTRACT&#13;
The purpose of this study is to quantify the welfare and foreign&#13;
exchange costs that arise in developing countries as a result of the&#13;
protectionist policies pursued by developed countries with respect to many&#13;
agricultural products. A detailed analysis is presented for four key&#13;
commodities: sugar, beef, wheat, and maize. For each commodity, the&#13;
potential gains to developing countries from a complete removal of tariff and&#13;
nontariff barriers in developed countries are analyzed within the framework of&#13;
a comparative-static world market equilibrium model. The study considers&#13;
fifty-eight developing countries as well as seventeen developed countries.&#13;
For each country and commodity, a consistent set of data on domestic&#13;
production, consumption, exports, and imports is taken from the Preliminary&#13;
Food Balance Sheets of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the&#13;
United Nations. The figures are averages for the years 1979 to 1981. The&#13;
world market price for each commodity equals the average deflated world export&#13;
unit value for the same years. For each commodity, the world market price is&#13;
linked to the export and import unit values of developing countries. Domestic&#13;
price elasticities of demand and supply are taken from previous studies. For&#13;
each developed country and commodity, ad valorem tariff and nontariff trade&#13;
barriers are derived from a comparison of domestic wholesale prices and t\he&#13;
corresponding import unit values.                                           \&#13;
The model is simulated for a variety of alternative assumptions&#13;
regarding the domestic supply elasticities of developing and developed&#13;
countries. Accordingly, the predicted costs of protectionism vary somewhat.&#13;
However, the results seem to suggest that a switch to free trade in wheat and&#13;
maize would lead to a net welfare loss to developing countries as a group,&#13;
although a number of them could expect considerable increases in foreign&#13;
exchange earnings. In contrast, free trade in sugar and beef is likely to&#13;
greatly benefit developing countries. For both commodities together, the&#13;
model predicts welfare gains between US$250 million and more than US$1.5&#13;
billion (1980) per year, depending on the underlying assumptions. The&#13;
corresponding increases in foreign exchange could be anywhere from US$6.6&#13;
billion to more than US$12 billion. For beef alone, foreign exchange earnings&#13;
can be expected to increase by more than 500 percent; most of this would go to&#13;
the countries of Latin America. Trade liberalization in sugar would favor&#13;
Asia and Latin America about equally.&#13;

1. Introduction&#13;
This study seeks to identify some of the welfare and foreign exchange&#13;
costs that developing countries must bear when developed countries follow a&#13;
policy of protectionism in the agricultural sector. The analysis is limited&#13;
to four commodities: sugar, beef and veal, wheat, and maize. These four&#13;
commodities are selected for somewhat different reasons. Sugar and beef are&#13;
included mainly because previous research (see, for example, Valdes and Zietz&#13;
1980) has shown that trade liberalization in these commodities would likely be&#13;
of the greatest benefit to developing countries. Wheat and maize are included&#13;
for a different reason. For some time now, a number of countries,&#13;
particularly large developed country exporters such as the United States and&#13;
Australia, have been keenly interested in the removal of trade barriers for&#13;
cereals. It is not clear, however, whether trade liberalization in cereals&#13;
would also be beneficial to developing countries, since most of them are net&#13;
importers and thus would be worse off with any increase in the world price&#13;
that is likely to result from trade liberalization. This study attempts to&#13;
shed some light on the relative gains of developed country exporters and&#13;
developing countries as a whole for two of the most widely traded cereals,&#13;
wheat and maize.&#13;
The potential gains from trade liberalization are analyzed within the&#13;
framework of a single-commodity world market equilibrium model. The&#13;
hypothetical case of a complete absence of tariffs and other nontariff trade&#13;
barriers in developed countries is compared with the current situation, which&#13;
is characterized by the existence of such impediments to trade. The model&#13;
employed for the analysis is of the partial equilibrium type. Interdependen-&#13;
cies among the four commodity markets under consideration are not explicitly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
modeled through the use of cross-price elasticities (see, for example,&#13;
Anderson and Tyers 1983). Rather, we follow the procedure that we employed in&#13;
a previous study (Valdes and Zietz 1980) and take interdependencies into&#13;
account implicitly by adjusting the own-price elasticities appropriately where&#13;
this seems necessary.&#13;
2. The Theoretical Model&#13;
A separate world market model is constructed for each of the four&#13;
commodities being analyzed. Each world market model is solved iteratively by&#13;
searching for a value of the increase in the world market price that achieves&#13;
postliberalization equilibruim. Compared with the closed-form solution that&#13;
we used in an earlier study (Valdes and Zietz 1980), the iterative method&#13;
allows us to simplify the computational treatment of trade reversals of&#13;
countries from a net-exporting to a net-importing position, or vice versa.&#13;
The model distinguishes among four categories of countries, developed&#13;
countries outside the European Community, the members of the European&#13;
Community, developing countries, and those countries not considered on an&#13;
individual basis. Since the study seeks to identify the costs to developing&#13;
countries of trade protectionism in developed countries and the European&#13;
Community, only the developed and European Community countries are assumed to&#13;
remove their trade barriers. The level of protectionism in all other&#13;
countries is held constant.&#13;
The countries within each category are assumed to react according to&#13;
the same behavioral postulates, although different parameter values are used&#13;
in each case. The behavioral postulates for each set of countries are&#13;
described next.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
2.1 Developed Countries&#13;
In the preliberalization situation, the domestic commodity price&#13;
(p0) prevailing in a particular developed country can be related to the world&#13;
market price prior to trade liberalization, pwo, by the equation&#13;
po = pwo r (1 + tO) (1 + m),&#13;
where r is the market exchange rate, tO the ad valorem equivalent of a&#13;
particular country's tariff and nontariff barriers, and m is a margin that&#13;
incorporates insurance, freight, and marketing costs. A tariff reduction by&#13;
all developed countries is assumed to change each country's domestic price to&#13;
P1 = pw1 r (1 + tl) (1 + m),&#13;
where pw1 is the world market price after the joint tariff reduction in all&#13;
developed countries and tl the postliberalization tariff level for a&#13;
particular developed country. The exchange rate, r, and the marketing&#13;
margin, m, are assumed to be unaffected by the changes induced by trade&#13;
liberalization. For developed countries, this assumption seems to be&#13;
justified, given the relatively small share of the four agricultural products&#13;
under study in the total value of trade for most countries.&#13;
When the domestic price before and after trade liberalization&#13;
(po and P1, respectively) is examined for each developed country, the&#13;
percentage change in domestic price (ph) resulting from trade&#13;
liberalization,l/     (p1 - P )/po,   can be calculated as&#13;
ph = (1 + pwh) [1 + dt/(l + tO)] - 1,&#13;
where pwh is defined as the percentage change in world price that is due to&#13;
the combined effect of trade liberalization in developed countries,&#13;
( pw1-pw0)/pwO , and where dt is the difference between the post-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
liberalization and the preliberalization tariff levels, tI-tO. For the case&#13;
of a complete elimination of tariffs, t1=0, the last expression reduces to&#13;
ph = (1 + pwh)/(l + tO) - 1.&#13;
When the price faced by consumers is substantially below the government&#13;
subsidized producer price, ph is calculated separately for consumption and&#13;
production by using the appropriate protection level for each.&#13;
Civen the percentage change in domestic price, ph, consumption, and&#13;
production in each developed country are assumed to change according to the&#13;
equations&#13;
(1)       dC = C0 [(1 + ph) Cp _ 1]&#13;
(2)       dQ = Q0 [( + ph)QP     - 1]&#13;
where  d  stands for change and where   £Z    indicates the own-price elasticity&#13;
of z.2/&#13;
Once the changes in domestic production and consumption are&#13;
determined, the postliberalization levels of net exports (XI) and net&#13;
imports (MI) can be derived from the equation sets (3) and (4),&#13;
respectively:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5&#13;
X1 = (X   + dQ - dC)       if ( ..)&gt;0 and XO &gt; 0&#13;
(3)       X1 =    -(Mo + dC - dQ)    if (..) &lt; 0 and Mo &gt; 0&#13;
ml = 0                     if ( ..)  &gt;Oand Mo   &gt; 0&#13;
Ml = (Mo + dC - dQ)        if (...) &gt; 0 and Mo  &gt; 0&#13;
(4)       Ml = -(X0 + dQ - dC)       if (...) &lt; 0 and X0    &gt; 0&#13;
ml =         O             if ( ..)&gt; Oand X0 &gt; 0.&#13;
A few points should be mentioned concerning equation sets (3) and (4). First,&#13;
although the new levels of exports and imports are calculated solely on the&#13;
basis of domestic demand and supply elasticities, the determining equations do&#13;
imply particular levels of the export-supply and import-demand&#13;
elasticitites. For example, the first equation in equation set (3) easily&#13;
derives from the familiar expression&#13;
K1 = X0   (1 + cX  ph)&#13;
if one replaces the export supply elasticity, £Xp      with its well-known excess&#13;
demand expression,&#13;
Exp  =Qp(Q/X) -       (C/X).&#13;
Multiplying out and substituting dC for     (C  £C  ph)   and'dQ for  (Q0 £Q   ph)&#13;
results in the first equation of (3).-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Second, both sets of equations, (3) and (4), explicitly allow for a&#13;
trade reversal of developed countries. Countries that are net importers in&#13;
the preliberalization state can become net exporters if the world price&#13;
increase exceeds the preliberalization tariff. Similarly, net-exporting&#13;
countries can become net importers if the tariff equivalent is sufficiently&#13;
large relative to the increase in world price.&#13;
Third, both sets of equations implicitly assume that any stock&#13;
changes that take place in the base period carry over to the new equilibrium&#13;
position without change. To put it differently, stock changes are assumed to&#13;
be constant in absolute terms and unaffected by trade liberalization.&#13;
2.2. Treatment of the European Community&#13;
Postliberalization export and import levels for European community&#13;
countries are calculated as they would be for any other developed country.&#13;
Hence, the description of the preceding section applies in full. The reason&#13;
for treating the European Community separately is the assumption that it&#13;
affects the world market only as a net trading entity, similar to a large&#13;
country with several regions or states. To incorporate such an effect, the&#13;
sum of the net imports of all European Community members is subtracted from&#13;
the sum of net exports to arrive at European Community net exports.&#13;
Consequently, postliberalization net exports of the European Community are&#13;
given by&#13;
EC&#13;
X1  = (£ X    - £    )    if (..) &gt; 0&#13;
xC                        otherwise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
where subscripts i and j stand for European Community countries that are net&#13;
importers and net exporters, respectively, after trade liberalization.&#13;
Postliberalization net imports of the European Community as a unit can be&#13;
written as&#13;
EC&#13;
M1  = ( M     - E x        if (..) &gt; O&#13;
I  1  ii     ij &#13;
EC&#13;
Ml  = 0                    otherwise.&#13;
As already noted, M1 and Xi are calculated for each member country of the&#13;
European Community as described by equations (1) to (4).&#13;
2.3 Developing Countries&#13;
Developing countries are expected to benefit from trade&#13;
liberalization in developed countries through a combination of two effects:&#13;
the world price increase associated with trade liberalization and the&#13;
potential increase in the quanity of their net exports to developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
The increase in the world price will benefit net exporting developing&#13;
countries independently of whether they increase their export quantity or&#13;
not. However, this general rule does not apply in the case of the ACP&#13;
countries--that is, those Afric,an, Carribean, and Pacific countries that have,&#13;
for certain commodities, preferential access to the market of the European&#13;
Community under a quota system. In selling on the high-price European market,&#13;
they effectively capture monopoly rents, which would be lost if trade were&#13;
liberalized. Hence trade liberalization could mean a net loss to ACP&#13;
countries. The same reasoning applies to developing countries that have&#13;
preferential access to the U.S. market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
Net importing developing countries will always be hurt by trade&#13;
liberalization unless they turn into net exporters. Even then, trade&#13;
liberalization produces an increase in welfare for the country as a whole only&#13;
if the lops in consumer surplus is less than the increase in producer surplus.&#13;
The quantitative effects of trade liberalization on developing&#13;
countries largely depend on the extent to which the world price increase is&#13;
transmitted to domestic producers and consumers. Studies on trade&#13;
liberalization commonly assume that the protection of the domestic market from&#13;
the world price remains the same in nonliberalizing countries. For fixed&#13;
exchange rates, this implies that the world price increase resulting from&#13;
trade liberalization in developed countries is transmitted in full to the&#13;
domestic market of developing countries. The internal price, in other words,&#13;
changes by the same percentage as the world market price. A potential problem&#13;
with this line of reasoning is the precondition of an exchange rate that is&#13;
unaffected by the export and import changes induced by trade liberalization.&#13;
Although this may be quite plausible for developed countries, it may be&#13;
somewhat unrealistic for developing countries that rely heavily on any one of&#13;
the commodities under study for most of their export earnings. There does not&#13;
seem to be an easy way out of this problem, however, other than changing the&#13;
basic setup of the partial equilibrium model used in this study.&#13;
2.3.1 The General Case&#13;
For each developing country, the response of consumption and&#13;
production to an increase in the world price can be caLcuLated by means of&#13;
equations (1) and (2), respectively, but replacing ph and with pwh. Post-&#13;
liberalization exports for developing countries are then given by the&#13;
equations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 9 _&#13;
X1 = XO + dQ - dC            if XO &gt; 0&#13;
X1 = -(M0 + dC - dQ)         if (..) &lt; O and M0 &gt; °&#13;
X= 0                         otherwise.&#13;
Postliberalization net import levels are derived as&#13;
M1 = (MO + dC - dQ)          if (..) &gt; O&#13;
m1   0                       otherwise.&#13;
As in the case of developed countries, the above equations allow for&#13;
the possibility that developing countries may turn from a net importing&#13;
position to net exporting position. Unlike the developed countries, however,&#13;
the developing countries outside the ACP-country group that are net exporters&#13;
prior to trade liberalization will always remain exporters.&#13;
Calculating export and import levels according to the response of&#13;
consumption and production assumes that each developing country has the&#13;
capacity to export readily any excess supply or import in case of excess&#13;
demand. For certain countries without an adequate infrastructure necessary&#13;
for foreign trade, this assumption may be considered overly optimistic. As an&#13;
alternative, postliberalization export and import levels could be calculated&#13;
from empirically observed trade elasticities. Postliberalization imports&#13;
would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Ml = M   (1 + e    pwh)        if e     pwh&gt;-1&#13;
1  0       Mpw                       mpw&#13;
m  = 0                         otherwise,&#13;
where    e      is the import-demand elasticity.    The corresponding equations&#13;
Mpw&#13;
for exports would be&#13;
X1 = X0 (1 + eX    pwh)            if XO &gt; 0&#13;
XI = -Mo (1 + eM    pwh)            if EMph pwh &lt; -1,&#13;
where    X    denotes the export-supply elasticity.&#13;
2.3.2. The Special Case of ACP-Countries&#13;
ACP countries currently sell part of their exports to the European&#13;
Community at a price substantially above that realized by non-ACP exporters.&#13;
Hence, for these countries, a removal of all European community trade barriers&#13;
would imply a price change that is different from pwh. The relevant&#13;
percentage change in price for ACP-country i, pwhi, is given by&#13;
I  -         x     x                  x&#13;
pwhi = (f   pw 1    Pod)/poi   if f pw0 &lt;&#13;
I&#13;
pwhi = pwh                     otherwise,&#13;
x&#13;
where    Poi  is the preliberalization export unit value of country      i;  ;  is&#13;
defined as the average regional value of 4i, which is given by the ratio of&#13;
preliberalization export unit value and world price.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
i   Poi tW&#13;
To relate pwhi to pwh, the first equation can be rewritten as&#13;
pwh. = (0/4i) (1 + pwh) - 1.&#13;
The if statement attached to the determining equation of    pwhi  implies that&#13;
ACP countries are treated differently from other developing countries only if&#13;
their preliberalization export unit value exceeds the average export unit&#13;
value of other exporters in the region. This implies that a particular ACP&#13;
country actually has to sell more than just a small fraction of its exports&#13;
under a preferential quota system to receive special treatment in this study.&#13;
For the calculation of the changes in consumption and production,&#13;
pwh' simply replaces ph in equations (1) and (2), respectively. Given dC&#13;
and dQ, the postliberalization levels of exports and imports of ACP countries&#13;
are derived as described in the preceding section. The ACP countries could&#13;
however, experience a trade reversal from a net-exporting to a net-importing&#13;
status. In that sense, the behavior of ACP countries resembles that of&#13;
developed countries.&#13;
2.4. Countries Classified as Rest-of-the-World&#13;
The category of countries classified as rest-of-the-world consists of&#13;
the centrally planned economies and small developing countries with less than&#13;
5 million inhabitants. For this category of countries, the post-&#13;
liberalization level of exports is derived as a weighted average of the export&#13;
level for the group of centrally planned economies (CPE) and the group of&#13;
small developing countries (SDC) as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
X1i  = w XOPE (1 + EX       pwh)&#13;
+ (1-w) XSDC (1 + eSDC    pwh),&#13;
0          Xpw&#13;
where w is the preliberalization share of the centrally planned economies in&#13;
the net exports of the countries categorized as rest-of-the-world. Similarly,&#13;
for postliberalization imports,&#13;
ROW       CPE       CPE&#13;
M       z M    (l+Mpw      pwh)&#13;
+ (1-z) MSDC (1 + £ DC   pwh),&#13;
0          Mpw&#13;
where z is the preliberalization share of centrally planned economies in the&#13;
net imports of the rest-of-the-world countries. Both the composite import-&#13;
demand and export-supply elasticities of the centrally planned economies are&#13;
determined empirically. The corresponding elasticities for the small&#13;
developing countries are calculated as a weighted average of the trade&#13;
elasticitites of those developing countries that are explicitly considered in&#13;
the study and that have no more than 8 million inhabitants. The trade&#13;
elasticitites for the developing countries included in the study are derived&#13;
using the well-known excess demand elasticity formulas&#13;
EMpw  = ECp (C/M) - eQp(Q/M)&#13;
Xpw     e   (Q/X) - e  (C/X)&#13;
X   Qp          Cp&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
for import demand and export supply, respectively. If one assumes that the&#13;
domestic price elasticities of consumption and production are the same for a&#13;
given country and commodity, the above equations reduce to&#13;
EMp   =     (c +Q)/M&#13;
Mpw     Cp&#13;
EXp     E   (c +Q)/X.&#13;
Xpw     Qp&#13;
From the last two equations one can easily see the rationale for including&#13;
only developing countries with less than 8 million inhabitants in the&#13;
calculation of the weighted trade elasticities of the smaller developing&#13;
countries. If large developing countries were included, the weighted trade&#13;
elasticities would likely be inflated because for large developing countries&#13;
the value of C+Q is generally quite large compared with M.&#13;
2.5. Solution of the Model&#13;
The model is solved iteratively by searching for a value of the world&#13;
price increase, pwh, that achieves postliberalization equilibrium in the&#13;
world market. Such an equilibruim is realized if the following equation holds&#13;
DC       LDC +   ROW    EC &#13;
1i    j  l j     1      1&#13;
MDC  + m  MLDC     ROW   MEC&#13;
Mlk   m% Im     + MI   +MI&#13;
2.6 Effects of Trade Liberalization on Developing Countries&#13;
For a given world price increase and corresponding quantities of&#13;
postliberalization exports and imports, one can derive the foreign exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
and welfare implications of trade liberalization for developing countries, as&#13;
described in the following sections.&#13;
2.6.1. The General Case&#13;
The change in export revenue of exporting country i and in import&#13;
costs of country j is&#13;
dVX. = (Xli pw1 - Xoi PwO    i&#13;
dVM  = (M j pw- moi P       O j&#13;
respectively, where    pwI   represents the world price after trade&#13;
liberalization.  For developing country    j,O.  is defined as&#13;
.j =   j P o&#13;
As noted earlier,    *i  equals the ratio of the export unit value of&#13;
developing country i to the world price in the preliberalization period.&#13;
For developing countries that incur a trade reversal owing to the&#13;
increase in world price--that is, countries that turn from a net importer to a&#13;
net exporter--the term dVM equals the negative of the preliberalization import&#13;
bill. Similarly, dVX equals the new level of export revenue after trade&#13;
liberalization. Since a preliberalization export unit value does not exist&#13;
for countries incurring a trade reversal, the regional average 0 substitutes&#13;
for  *i.    Hence, the increase in export revenue for developing country     i&#13;
that incurs a trade reversal is given by&#13;
dVXi = Xi P&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
The welfare gain of trade liberalization to developing country&#13;
exporter i can be approximated by&#13;
dWXi = 0.5 (pwI - pw0) (Xoi + X i) *i&#13;
Similarly, for importing developing country j, one can approximate the&#13;
welfare loss incurred by the world price increase owing to trade&#13;
liberalization as&#13;
dWM. = 0.5 (pw1 - pwO) (Moi +Mi) ei.&#13;
Finally, for developing country i with a trade reversal from a net-&#13;
importing to a net-exporting status, the change in welfare is derived by the&#13;
equations&#13;
dWX. = 0.5 [(f pw1    Pxi )   xi- (pi P-   ) M0],&#13;
dWM. =0&#13;
T&#13;
where  P     is the price at which a trade reversal would occur in terms of&#13;
T&#13;
import unit values;     pXi  is the corresponding price in terms of export unit&#13;
values. The latter is related to the former by the relation&#13;
Pxi = Pi   (pw0 0  /Poi&#13;
where f is defined as in section 2.3.2. For each country i, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
determining equation of   pT   is found by setting domestic production,&#13;
eQp                                        cCp&#13;
Ap   ,    equal to domestic consumption,   Bp      and solving for   p.  To do&#13;
so, we need values of the constants A and B. For each country, they are&#13;
found by the equations&#13;
A = Q / pM cQP&#13;
p 0 &#13;
and&#13;
B = C /pM £Cp,&#13;
respectively. Both equations are based on the somewhat unrealistic assumption&#13;
that a country's import unit value for a particular commodity,     p0,  is equal&#13;
to the domestic market price. Given the lack of detailed country data and the&#13;
tentative nature of the trade reversal calculations, this approximation does&#13;
not seem to be unreasonable.   According to the above assumptions,    pT   is&#13;
determined for each developing country by the equation&#13;
p  = exp Qln (C pM     Cp)&#13;
- In (Q p) -               EC ) Cp&#13;
Clearly, in the case of a trade reversal, dWX can be positive or negative,&#13;
depending on whether the welfare gain to producers outweighs the welfare loss&#13;
to consumers.&#13;
2.6.2 Some Special Cases&#13;
The first special case to be considered is that of ACP countries.&#13;
For ACP country i, which remains a net exporter in the postliberalization&#13;
period, the change in welfare is derived by the following two equations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
dWX    0.5 (o pw1 - 4ipwo) (Xoi + X i)&#13;
dWM. = 0&#13;
1&#13;
For ACP country j, which incurs a trade reversal from a net-exporting to a&#13;
net-importing status, the change in welfare is calculated as&#13;
dWM. = 0.5 [(pM; - Opwl) M.j - (Poj - pT) x0;]&#13;
dWX. = 0,&#13;
where  pT   is derived by the general formula given in the last section except&#13;
J&#13;
X                       M       T           T&#13;
that, for each   j,   pO is substituted for P0.       Pmj gives   p.  in terms of&#13;
T&#13;
import unit values.   It is related to   pj   by the equation&#13;
T     T &#13;
PMj =Pj (pwo 5/po&#13;
which can also be written as&#13;
T    T      -&#13;
PMj   P;(o&#13;
A second special case derives frome some price distortions introduced&#13;
into the beef market by Australian export behavior.4/ Since Australian&#13;
exporters of beef earn quota rights to the U.S. market by selling beef to&#13;
developing countries under world market level, many importing developing&#13;
countries outside Latin American can buy beef at artificially low prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Trade liberalization is likely to eliminate these rents and force developing&#13;
countries to buy at world market prices.&#13;
To incorporate this additional loss of rents among developing&#13;
countries that import beef we must modify the determining equations of dVM and&#13;
dMW somewhat. Also, some changes have to be made for ACP countries that are&#13;
subject to a trade reversal from a net exporting to a net importing status.&#13;
For country j outside of the ACP group of countries and Latin&#13;
America, the change in the import bill is calculated as&#13;
dVM  =Mj pw     -  oj Poj&#13;
if  pw0 &gt; Poj   holds.5/  If this last condition is not satisfied for country&#13;
j, it is assumed that the country does not benefit from sales of Australian&#13;
beef below the world market price in the preliberalization period. As a&#13;
consequence, the change in its import bill is derived as for the general case&#13;
discussed in the previous section. Similarly, the change in welfare of&#13;
developing country beef importer k is&#13;
dWM  =   0-.5 (pw, - p M) (M   + M)&#13;
k             1    Ok    Ok     lk&#13;
M&#13;
if  pwO &gt; Pok*    Again, if the condition does not hold, the corresponding&#13;
equations of the preceding section apply.&#13;
The change in welfare of ACP countries that incur a trade reversal&#13;
from a net exporting to a net importing status is given by the equation&#13;
described at the beginning of this section, except that the term     OpwI   now&#13;
reduces to just pw1.   Also, the calculation of   pM;   simplifies to&#13;
T    T     /X)&#13;
pMj= p. (pw00p)&#13;
J         p.0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
3. Data&#13;
Four commodities are analyzed: total sugar measured in raw&#13;
equivalents,61 (FAO Trade Yearbook classification number 061), beef and veal&#13;
(FAO Trade number 011.1), wheat and wheat flour measured in wheat equivalents,&#13;
and maize (FAO Trade number 044).&#13;
The study explicitly incorporates all market-economy developing&#13;
countries with a 1980 population level of more than 5 million; the total is&#13;
fifty-eight countries. The geographical distribution is as follows: twenty-&#13;
one countries are from the sub-Saharan region, twelve from Asia, twelve from&#13;
North Africa and the Middle East, and thirteen from Latin America. Seventeen&#13;
market-economy developed countries are considered. All are members of the&#13;
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). All the&#13;
remaining countries of the world--that is, small market economy, developing&#13;
countries as well as centrally planned countries--are lumped together in a&#13;
category identified as rest of the world.&#13;
3.1 Quantities and Prices&#13;
Data on domestic production (Q0), consumption (CO), exports (X0), and&#13;
imports (MO) are taken from the Preliminary Food Balance Sheets of the Food&#13;
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The figures are averages&#13;
for the years 1979 to 1981. X0 and Mo are net exports and net imports,&#13;
respectively. Consumption is calculated as a residual:&#13;
O    QO   XO   + M   - - dSTO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
where X' and M' are gross exports and imports, respectively, and where dST&#13;
represents stock changes. A listing of production, consumption, net export&#13;
and net import data by commodity and country is provided in appendix A.&#13;
The preliberalization world market price    (pw0)  equals the average&#13;
deflated world export unit value for the years 1979 to 1981. It is calculated&#13;
by dividing the value of world exports by the quantity of world exports for&#13;
each year and deflating the resulting values by the world wholesale price&#13;
index as published in the IMF International Financial Statistics. The price&#13;
index has 1980 as its base year. Value and quantity of world exports are from&#13;
the FAO Trade Yearbook. The value of pwo for sugar is derived by excluding&#13;
Cuba and the principal ACP exporters of sugar7/ from the value and quantity of&#13;
world exports. Cuba is excluded from the calculations because it is exporting&#13;
most of its sugar to the Soviet Union at prices far in excess of those found&#13;
in the free market. A similar argument can be made for the ACP countries,&#13;
which are selling under a preferential quota system on the high-price European&#13;
market. Because detailed country data on sugar exports are lacking for 1983,&#13;
the same method could not be used for that year. Instead, the world price of&#13;
sugar for 1983 was set equal to its 1979-81 average, multipled by the factor&#13;
0.54. The latter factor can be found by dividing the average deflated export&#13;
unit value of Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and the Philippines for 1979 to&#13;
1981, as quoted in IMF International Financial Statistics (Yearbook 1984),&#13;
into the corresponding average for 1983.   The prices used for the term    pw0&#13;
throughout the study are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Prices&#13;
Commodity                    1979-81              1983&#13;
Total sugar                    396.7              214.2&#13;
Beef and veal                 2513.7&#13;
Wheat and flour                186.6&#13;
Maize                          145.6&#13;
All prices are expressed in 1980 U.S. dollars per metric ton.&#13;
For each commodity and developing country, unit values of trade&#13;
(pX  and  pO )    are calculated as simple averages of the deflated unit&#13;
values of the years 1979 to 1981. The raw data come from the 1981 FAO Trade&#13;
Yearbook. Average regional unit trade values are substituted whenever a&#13;
country's trade value was judged unreliable because of a very small level of&#13;
trade. Lack of data made it necessary to construct the 1983 export and import&#13;
unit values of sugar from their average 1979-81 levels. This was accomplished&#13;
by multiplying the average 1979-81 levels by the factor 0.54, the derivation&#13;
of which is described above.&#13;
3.2 Demand and Supply Elasticities&#13;
Values for domestic demand and supply elasticitites are taken from&#13;
the following sources: Askari and Cummings (1976), Caspari et al. (1980),&#13;
Koester and Schmitz (1982), Stern et al. (1976), Tyers (1982), Tyers and&#13;
Anderson (1983), and Valdes (1975).&#13;
The demand elasticities for sugar are from Stern et al. (1976, pp.&#13;
336-37), except for Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The domestic&#13;
demand elasticities for these countries are from Caspari et al. (1980, pp. 56&#13;
76, and 105, respectively). For countries not mentioned in either Stern et&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
al. (1976) or Caspari et al. (1980), the demand elasticities are assumed to be&#13;
0.4. This elasticity value corresponds to the one reported in Stern et al.&#13;
(1976, pp. 354-57) for developing countries.&#13;
For the benchmark run, the supply elasticity of sugar is set equal to&#13;
0.6 for all countries. This value is somewhat below the unitary elasticity&#13;
used by Koester and Schmitz (1982) for countries outside the European&#13;
Community. A lower elasticity is used here to account for possible&#13;
interdependencies in production between sugar and the other commodities&#13;
considered in this study.8/ Also, the more conservative elasticity value&#13;
reflects the relatively high degree of uncertainty regarding the supply&#13;
response of sugar. The uncertainty results from an unusual scarcity of&#13;
econometric evidence. To check on the sensitivity of the results with respect&#13;
to the assumed elasticity of 0.6, the model was also run with three&#13;
alternative elasticity assumptions. The first alternative model simulation&#13;
uses a supply elasticity of 0.06 rather than 0.6 for all European Community&#13;
countries. This reflects the possibility that sugar production in the&#13;
European Community may change very little if trade is liberalized in grains&#13;
and sugar at the same time. Farmers could very well switch from the&#13;
production of grains, which is afforded generally higher protection levels&#13;
than sugar, to the production of sugar. A second alternative model run is&#13;
based on the opposite assumption that sugar production in developed countries&#13;
would react very sharply to an elimination of trade barriers. To incorporate&#13;
this assumption, the supply elasticity of all European Community countries is&#13;
raised tenfold to 6.0. A supply elasticity of 4.0 is assumed for all other&#13;
developed countries with significant protection levels, which include all&#13;
producers with the exception of Australia. For a third alternative model run,&#13;
the supply elasticity of all developing countries is doubled from 0.6 to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
1.2. The higher supply elasticity is meant to incorporate the possibility&#13;
that a removal of all trade barriers in developed countries could effectively&#13;
eliminate the consequences of what may be called export perssimism of&#13;
developing countries.-    The prospect of assured free access to the market of&#13;
developed countries could, in other words, spark considerable investments in&#13;
the sugar industry.&#13;
For beef and veal, the domestic demand elasticities of Argentina,&#13;
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela are adapted from Valdes (1975). An&#13;
elasticity of 0.5 is used for these countries. This is somewhat below the&#13;
values reported by Valdes. The domestic demand elasticity of New Zealand is&#13;
from Stern et al. (1976, pp. 354-57). The corresponding values for the&#13;
members of the European Community are taken from Caspari et al. (1980, p.&#13;
124). The supply elasticities for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and&#13;
Venezuela are adapted from Valdes (1975), whose estimates are close to 1.50.&#13;
Thus the value of 1.0 used in this study is rather conservative. The supply&#13;
elasticities for the Netherlands and West Cermany are from Stern et al. (1976,&#13;
pp. 354-57). Both the demand and the supply elasticities for ruminant meat&#13;
reported in Tyers (1982) are used for Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Korea,&#13;
Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States. The corresponding&#13;
elasticities for Japan are from Tyers and Anderson (1983), as is the supply&#13;
elasticity for all member countries of the European Community except Germany&#13;
and the Netherlands. For all countries for which none of the consulted&#13;
studies gave an estimate, the domestic demand and supply elasticities are set&#13;
equal to 0.4, except in the case of the Latin American countries. On the&#13;
basis of Valdes's (1975) study of the beef sector in South America, which&#13;
showed a rather high supply response, it was decided to use 0.6 as the default&#13;
supply elasticity for Latin American countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
For an alternative run of the beef model, the somewhat more&#13;
conservation value of 0.4 is substituted for the supply elasticity of all&#13;
European Community countries and Japan. This is done to incorporate the&#13;
uncertainty regarding the supply response of beef if tariff barriers are&#13;
eliminated in grains at the same time.&#13;
Two sets of elasticities are used for wheat and maize. The&#13;
elasticities entering the benchmark runs of the model are described first.&#13;
The domestic demand and supply elasticities for wheat and coarse grains listed&#13;
in Tyers (1982) are used for Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia,&#13;
the Philippines, Thailand, and the United States. The Australian elasticities&#13;
are also employed for New Zealand. The coarse grains elasticities are&#13;
substituted for the maize elasticities needed in the study. The wheat&#13;
elasticities for Bangladesh and India as well as the maize elasticities for&#13;
Pakistan also come from Tyers (1982). The wheat and coarse grain elasticities&#13;
for Japan and the European Community are taken from Tyers and Anderson&#13;
(1983). The supply elasticities of maize for India and Syria are from Askari&#13;
and Cummings (1976). India's elasticity of 0.7 is at the lower end of a whole&#13;
range of estimates presented by Askari and Cummings. For all countries not&#13;
mentioned explicitly, the domestic demand and supply elasticities are set&#13;
equal to 0.4 for both wheat and maize. These values correspond roughly to&#13;
those reported in Stern et al. (1976, pp. 354-57) for both developed and&#13;
developing countries. To check on the sensitivity of the model results with&#13;
respect to the choice of the domestic supply elasticities, we used a second&#13;
set of elasticities for both wheat and maize. It differs from the one just&#13;
described with regard to the default values of the supply elasticity of&#13;
developing countries. For both wheat and maize, the default value of 0.4 used&#13;
in the benchmark runs is doubled to 0.8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
The calculation of postliberalization export and import levels of the&#13;
rest-of-the-world countries requires a value for the share of the centrally&#13;
planned economies in the net exports and net imports of the countries of this&#13;
category. These market shares are derived from the export and import data&#13;
reported in the FAO Preliminary Food Balance Sheets. All Eastern European&#13;
countries as well as the Soviet Union are classified as centrally planned&#13;
economies. Their share of rest-of-the-world net exports is 0, 0.25, 0.54, and&#13;
0 for sugar, beef, wheat, and maize, respectively. Their share of rest-of-&#13;
the-world net imports is calculated as 0.58, 0.37, 0.43 and 0.53,&#13;
respectively, for the same commodities. The import-demand elasticities&#13;
reported for the Soviet Union in Tyers (1982) are assumed to represent the&#13;
corresponding elasticities for the centrally planned economies as a whole.&#13;
This assumption seems justified given the overwhelming share of the Soviet&#13;
Union in the imports of the centrally planned economies. The elasticity&#13;
values are -1.0, -0.27, and -0.46 for wheat, maize, and beef, respectively.&#13;
The unit elasticity for wheat corresponds exactly to the estimate by Carson et&#13;
al. (1984) for their preferred model. The import-demand elasticity for sugar&#13;
was set to -1.0. The rationale for this rather low elasticity is that the&#13;
Soviet Union receives most its sugar under long-term contracts from Cuba.&#13;
Hence, changes in the world market price probably do not greatly influence its&#13;
imports. The export-supply elasticities of the centrally planned economies&#13;
for beef and wheat are set to 1.0. Since their export share for sugar and&#13;
maize is set at zero, no assumption regarding the corresponding export-supply&#13;
elasticities is needed.&#13;
3.3. Protection Levels&#13;
Ad valorem tariff equivalents of tariff and nontariff trade barriers&#13;
are derived from a comparison of domestic wholesale prices and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
corresponding import unit values or border prices for each trade liberalizing&#13;
country and commodity.-0/ The calculations are based on the nominal&#13;
protection coefficient (NPC), 1+tO, which is defined as the ratio of the&#13;
domestic to the c.i.f. or border price, with both prices expressed in the same&#13;
currency units. Wherever necessary, a distinction is made between the&#13;
protection afforded to producers and the level of protection relevant to&#13;
consumers. The derivation of the protection levels is described by&#13;
commodity. The members of the European Community are treated separately from&#13;
the other developed countries included in the study.&#13;
3.3.1. Sugar&#13;
The basic protection level of the European Community is derived by&#13;
dividing the threshold price of raw sugar by its c.i.f. Rotterdam price for&#13;
each year from 1979 to 1981 and taking a simple average. The threshold prices&#13;
for raw sugar are from the Agricultural Yearbook (1983) and the c.i.f.&#13;
Rotterdam prices from Agricultural Prices (June 1984). The NPCs for the&#13;
marketing years 1978-79 to 1980-81 are 2.8, 1.36, and 0.9, respectively, which&#13;
gives an average of 1.69. Given the average protection level for the European&#13;
Community, individual country protection levels are derived by multiplying the&#13;
average nominal protection rate (NPR), NPC-1, by an index of relative prices&#13;
within the European Community. This index is based on the selling prices of&#13;
sugar beet of standard quality measured in ECU as reported in Agricultural&#13;
Price Statistics 1983 (Table 1085). An average price for 1979 to 1981 was&#13;
calculated for each country.!!/ The average found for Italy, the country with&#13;
the highest sugar beet price, was set equal to one. All other average prices&#13;
were divided by the Italian average to find the remaining index numbers.&#13;
Italy's price level was set to 1.0 in deriving the index to incorporate the&#13;
fact that a part of the NPR for the European Community'as a whole is clearly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
redundant for those of its members that export sugar. As pointed out by&#13;
Koester (1982, p. 15) for the case of grains, exports from a country imply&#13;
that its internal price is about equal to the intervention price. But the&#13;
latter was about 17 percent below the threshold price for the years 1979 to&#13;
1983. A lowering of the threshold price within that percentage range cannot&#13;
be expected to induce imports to sugar-exporting countries. From this derives&#13;
the partial redundancy of the threshold price.&#13;
The basic procedure described above was also used for the derivation&#13;
of the 1983 protection levels. Since no domestic prices were available at the&#13;
time of the calculations, however, the 1983 prices in local currency were&#13;
calculated from the 1975 prices using the Index of Producer Prices for sugar&#13;
beet quoted above. The equivalent prices in ECU were found by applying the&#13;
exchange rates (green rates) listed in the Official Journal of the European&#13;
Community (L 132, May 21, 1983).121&#13;
NPCs for non-European Community countries were drived, in general, by&#13;
dividing the raw sugar equivalent of the producer price of sugar beet as&#13;
reported in FAO Producer Prices by the import unit values for total sugar as&#13;
derived from the FAO Trade Yearbook for 1981. The raw sugar equivalent of the&#13;
beet price was estimated by the FAO method of multiplying the beet price by&#13;
10. The local currency prices given in the FAO printout were converted into&#13;
U.S. dollars using the market exchange rates published in OECD Economic&#13;
Outlook (1984, p. 19). These computations were carried out for each of the&#13;
years 1979 to 1981. The NPC used in the study is a simple average of those&#13;
three values.&#13;
Some adjustments to the above procedure were needed for certain&#13;
countries. For sugar-exporting countries, the import unit value of a&#13;
neighboring importing country was substituted. This was done for Austria and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Australia. The Swiss import unit value was substituted for the Austrian value&#13;
and the Oceania value for Australia's. For Australia, the FAO printout also&#13;
contained a price quotation for raw sugar. This was used instead of the sugar&#13;
beet price. For the United States, the New York raw sugar price listed in&#13;
Business Statistic 1982 (U.S. Department of Commerce 1983, p. 100) was taken&#13;
as the representative domestic price. In the case of countries for which the&#13;
producer price of raw sugar is far in excess of the wholesale price of refined&#13;
sugar as published in the Sugar Yearbook of the International Sugar&#13;
Organization, a separate NPC was calculated for refined sugar The&#13;
corresponding NPR value replaces tO in equation (1). For Norway and&#13;
Switzerland, the wholesale price of refined sugar from the Sugar Yearbook was&#13;
divided by the import unit value of refined sugar from the FAO Trade Yearbook&#13;
for 1981. The average of the 1978 and 1981 values was used for tO in (1).&#13;
The corresponding number for Canada was derived in the same way, except that&#13;
the average import unit value of Norway and Switzerland substituted for&#13;
Canada's which was considered unusable.&#13;
Lack of data presented some probLems in deriving meaningful NPCs for&#13;
the non-European Community countries for the year 1983. One exception is the&#13;
United States. To find its NPC, we divided the New York raw sugar spot price&#13;
(c.i.f., duty/fee paid, contract #12) by the spot raw sugar world price of the&#13;
International Sugar Agreement. Both numbers are from the Commodity Yearbook&#13;
(Commodity Research Bureau April 1984). For all otheV non-European Community&#13;
countries, the 1978 NPC value-3/ was adjusted by a factor reflecting the&#13;
increase of the world price of raw sugar from 1978 to 1983 (8.14 percent) and&#13;
the hypothesized increase in the domestic price over its 1978 value. On the&#13;
basis of the development of beet producer prices in the FAO Producer Prices&#13;
printout, a 10 percent increase was hypothesized for the domestic sugar price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
in Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland. A 25 percent increase was assumed for&#13;
Japan and Canada. All percentage increases are likely to be on the&#13;
conservative side.&#13;
The procedure described earlier for deriving the NPR value faced by&#13;
consumers in Norway, Switzerland, and Canada was applied in an analogous way&#13;
for 1983. Since no data were available for that year, the calculations were&#13;
done for 1978, a year with a world price of raw sugar somewhat below the one&#13;
for 1983 in nominal terms. No adjustment factor was applied to correct for&#13;
the differences in domestic and international prices of refined sugar between&#13;
1978 and 1983 owing to the lack of a perceptible trend in domestic wholesale&#13;
prices and the unavailability of an import unit value for refined sugar.&#13;
3.3.2. Beef and Veal&#13;
NPCs for all countries were derived by dividing the U.S. import unit&#13;
value for beef from the FAO Trade Yearbook for 1981 into the domestic&#13;
wholesale price of beef. The NPCs found for the years 1979 to 1981 were&#13;
averaged to arrive at the value of (1+tO) for equations (1) and (2). The&#13;
choice of the U.S. import unit value as the border price for all developed&#13;
countries derives from an effort to match domestic wholesale and border prices&#13;
of meat of approximately the same quality. Import unit values of beef vary&#13;
greatly from country to country, depending on the quality of beef imported.&#13;
For example, countries that import mainly high-quality boneless beef, such as&#13;
Japan4/ , have a rather high import unit value. However, the domestic&#13;
wholesale beef prices, which are available, refer in general to carcass weight&#13;
beef. They are considerably below the corresponding prices of lean, boneless&#13;
beef. Hence, calculations of NPCs based on individual country import unit&#13;
values or a world market price of boneless beefl5/ are likely to underestimate&#13;
the true protection level in many cases. The U.S. import unit value was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
chosen as the denominator in the NPC calculations for the benchmark runs&#13;
because it is believed to be representative of the quality of beef for which&#13;
domestic prices could be obtained. It should be noted, however, that it is by&#13;
far not the lowest import unit value for the developed countries under&#13;
consideration. At the same time, it is well above other unit import values&#13;
that may be considered useful for the NPC calculcations. These include the&#13;
import unit values of most countries of the Middle East or of the Soviet&#13;
Union.&#13;
For the calculations of NPCs for the European Community countries,&#13;
the dollar price was converted into ECU using the exchange rates given in the&#13;
Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics of the European Community. The domestic&#13;
wholesale prices are from Agricultural Price Statistics 1983 (table 2045).&#13;
The prices refer to good-quality carcass meat of heavy cattle. Since no&#13;
prices were quoted for Ireland, the United Kingdom prices were used as a&#13;
substitute.&#13;
For most other countries, NPCs were computed on the basis of the&#13;
producer prices given in the FAO Producer Prices printout. Again, the&#13;
domestic currency prices were converted to U.S. dollars at the market exchange&#13;
rates quoted in OECD Economic Outlook (1984). For Austria, Canada, the United&#13;
States, and Japan, NPCs were calculated using domestic beef prices taken from&#13;
original government statistics. In the case of Austria, the beef price is&#13;
from the 1982 Taetigkeitsbericht of the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Forestry. It refers to the average price of half animals, carcass weight, of&#13;
steers, oxen, and calves on all "Richtmaerkte." The Canadian Prices are the&#13;
Ontario wholesale prices for dressed A-1 steer carcass beef weighing 500 to&#13;
700 pounds, as quoted in the Livestock Market Review. The U.S. price is taken&#13;
from Business Statistics 1982 and refers to the wholesale price of 600- to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
700-pound fresh steer carcasses. The domestic Japanese prices are from The&#13;
Meat Statistics in Japan (January 1984, table 15) and refer to the wholesale&#13;
carcass price of first-grade steer beef. Again, all domestic currency prices&#13;
are converted to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in OECD Economic&#13;
Outlook (1984). As it turns out, the average NPRs calculated from the&#13;
original data sources are very close to the ones that can be derived using the&#13;
prices given in the FAO Producer Prices printout.&#13;
3.3.3. Wheat&#13;
For the European Community, the NPR values were taken from Koester&#13;
(1982). NPRs for individual European Community countries were derived by&#13;
multiplying their average NPR value for the years 1979 to 1981 by an index&#13;
reflecting the wholesale price differences among its members. The wholesale&#13;
prices of soft wheat from Agricultural Price Statistics 1983 (table 1045)&#13;
measured in ECU were used for the construction of the index. No wholesale&#13;
prices are quoted for the United Kingdom and Ireland. The producer prices for&#13;
soft wheat from Agricultural Price Statistics 1983 (table 1005) were taken as&#13;
a substitute. To make them comparable with wholesale prices, we multiplied&#13;
them by the average ratio of wholesale-to-producer prices for those countries&#13;
for which both prices were available. The adjustment factor is 1.07 for 1979&#13;
and 1980, and 1.06 for 1981. Given wholesale prices for all European&#13;
Community countries, the above-mentioned index was constructed by setting the&#13;
wholesale price of Germany equal to 1.0. The reason for doing this is similar&#13;
to that given for the sugar protection levels.16/&#13;
For all non-European Community countries, with the exception of&#13;
Australia and Japan, NPRs were calculated for each year from 1979 to 1981 by&#13;
dividing the U.S. dollar producer prices given in the World Wheat Statistics&#13;
(1982) by the respective import unit values from the FAO Trade Yearbook. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
producer prices for Australia come from the Australia Yearbook. The producer&#13;
prices for Japan are the government purchasing prices taken from the 58th&#13;
Statistical Yearbook (1981-82, appendix 1). The import unit values of&#13;
Switzerland and Norway were substituted for the ones of Austria and Sweden,&#13;
respectively. Japan's import unit value was used for both Australia and New&#13;
Zealand.&#13;
Information in Austria's Statistisches Handbuch on the years 1980 and&#13;
1981 indicates that the wholesale price of wheat was below the producer price&#13;
by approximately 13 percent in those years. -Using this information we&#13;
calculated a separate NPR value for consumers. Similarly, the 58th&#13;
Statistical Yearbook of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture quotes a&#13;
government selling price for wheat far below the corresponding purchase&#13;
price. Again, a consumer-specific NPR was calculated along the principles&#13;
outlined above.&#13;
3.3.4. Maize&#13;
The NPR value for the European Community over the years 1979 to 1981&#13;
is a simple average of the annual estimates presented in Koester (1982, p.&#13;
15). As in the case of wheat, an index was constructed on the basis of&#13;
information on the wholesale prices in individual European Community&#13;
countries. The wholesale prices are from Agricultural Price Statistics 1983&#13;
(table 1060). The prices for the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Denmark are&#13;
estimates from FAO Producer Prices. The local currency prices were converted&#13;
to ECU using the implicit conversion rate for soft wheat in table 1005 of&#13;
Agricultural Price Statistics, 1978-81. The resulting prices were adjusted&#13;
for each year by the average ratio of producer to wholesale prices for&#13;
Germany, France, and Italy, as derived from Agricultural Price Statistics&#13;
(tables 1035 and 1060).   Since no FAQ prices are available for Ireland for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33 -&#13;
years 1980 and 1981, it was assumed that the ratio of Ireland's average 1979-&#13;
81 price to the average United Kingdom price over the same time period equals&#13;
the ratio of the two countries' 1979 prices.&#13;
For non-European Community countries, NPCs were derived from the FAO&#13;
Producer Prices, converted to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates given in OECD&#13;
Economic Outlook (1984), and the appropriate import unit values. For Austria,&#13;
the FAO producer prices could be checked against those published by the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture in its Lagebericht 1982. The two series are the&#13;
same. Norway's import unit value was used as the denominator in the NPC&#13;
calculations for Norway, Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland.&#13;
4. Results&#13;
Table 1 provides an overview of the effects on developing&#13;
countries-7/ of a complete removal of trade barriers for sugar, beef, wheat,&#13;
and maize as they prevailed in developed countries during 1979 to 1981. It&#13;
also gives the model's predictions of the changes in the world market price&#13;
and in world exports. World exports are defined as the sum of the net exports&#13;
of all exporting countries. Several results are presented for each of the&#13;
four commodities analyzed in this study. Differences among the results are&#13;
solely due to differences in the assumed supply elasticities. For each&#13;
commodity, superscript 1 indicates the use of the benchmark elasticities as&#13;
they can be found in appendix A. For beef, wheat, and maize, superscript 2&#13;
identifies the alternative elasticity assumptions described in the data&#13;
section.-8/  The alternative elasticity assumptions for sugar are as follows:&#13;

elasticities. Details are given in the text. World exports are defined as the sum&#13;

the world price increases predicted by the model are roughly between 10 and 30&#13;
percent. For sugar and beef, they are somewhat larger than for the two&#13;
cereals included in the study, in part because of the more widespread use of&#13;
trade protectionism for the former commodities. The case of sugar&#13;
demonstrates that the calculated increase in the world price is quite&#13;
sensitive to the underlying domestic supply elasticities. The world price is&#13;
predicted to rise most if the trade liberalizing countries are assumed to have&#13;
a very high price elasticity of supply. If instead the domestic supply&#13;
elasticities of all developing countries are doubled to 1.2, the world price&#13;
rises by only 13 percent, rather than by almost 30 percent. Reducing the&#13;
domestic supply elasticities of both the European Community countries and&#13;
Japan for the case of beef also has a noticeable impact on the reported&#13;
results. On the other hand, doubling the domestic supply elasticities of&#13;
developing countries for wheat and maize does not have a significant effect on&#13;
the world market. This is largely due to the fact that most developing&#13;
countries are importers of grain. The share of developing countries in world&#13;
exports is a mere 6 percent for wheat and 12 percent for maize for the years&#13;
1979 to 1981.&#13;

model,-9/ an increase of approximately US$10 billion per year is predicted for&#13;
the total of the four commodities. This value is expressed in 1980 dollars.&#13;
Hence, the equivalent figure in 1984 dollars would exceed 14 billion. As&#13;
expected, the change in welfare of developing country exporters is only a&#13;
fraction of the foreign exchange increase, thereby reflecting the domestic&#13;
resource cost of increased production. Its ratio to the change in foreign&#13;
exchange earnings varies between 0.1 and 0.25 because of different implicit&#13;
export-supply elasticities among commodities. For all four commodities, the&#13;
predicted increase in world price results in an absolute decrease in the value&#13;
of developing country imports. This reaction implies an elastic import demand&#13;
for developing countries as a whole. The reduction in the import bill,&#13;
although equivalent to a saving of foreign exchange, causes a welfare loss to&#13;
developing countries, as is evident from the low values of the net welfare&#13;
change in the last column of table 1.2°/ Taking developing country exporters&#13;
and importers together, trade liberalization in wheat and maize would actually&#13;
cause a net welfare loss to these countries as a group. Beef is the commodity&#13;
for which the difference between gross and net welfare changes is smallest,&#13;
both in absolute and percentage terms, the reason being that developing&#13;
countries as a group import less than 20 percent of all beef entering world&#13;
trade. On the other hand, they import more than 40 percent of all wheat in&#13;
the preliberalization period.&#13;
Table 2 reports how the results for sugar change if the calculations&#13;
are based on 1983 prices and protection levels. The percentage changes in the&#13;
world price are more than twice as large as those reported in table 1. For&#13;
the most part the percentage changes in world exports are more than three&#13;
times larger than those of table 1. Considerably larger numbers also result&#13;
for foreign exchange earnings and welfare increases. In interpreting table 2,&#13;
however, it should be remembered that, for many countries outside the European&#13;

Community, the lack of adequate data made the derivation of the 1983&#13;
protection -levels even less straightforward than for the period 1979-81.&#13;

Similarly, all 1983 export and import unit values had to be derived from their&#13;
1979-81 levels by means of some conversion factor. Possibly the most&#13;
important qualification of the 1983 results for sugar has to do with the use&#13;
of 1979-81 quantities owing to the lack of consistent data for 1983. Finally,&#13;
one may ask whether the large 1983 protection levels were an unusual&#13;
occurrence or whether they are more likely to represent historical and future&#13;
developments of the sugar market than the 1979-81 protection levels. Future&#13;
developments are not considered here. Historically, however, the year 1983&#13;
seems to have been somewhat unusual. The 1983 sugar price2i' was the lowest&#13;
in real terms since 1948, except for the years 1965 to 1968.     For many&#13;
countries, this also means that, excluding the latter part of the 1960s,&#13;
protection levels were at a record high in 1983.     The nominal protection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
coefficient for the European Community22/ may illustrate this point. For the&#13;
years 1973-74 to 1982-83, the coefficient has developed as follows:&#13;
Year    1973-74     75    76     77      78     79     80     81     82      83&#13;

In the light of the historical record of sugar prices and protection levels,&#13;
it seems that the 1983 results for sugar have to be regarded as an upper limit&#13;
on the costs that trade protectionism imposes on developing countries.&#13;
As already mentioned, the study includes only developing countries&#13;
with a minimum of 5 million inhabitants in the base period. Many large sugar&#13;
producers, however, can be found among those countries that are excluded from&#13;
this study because of size. It also happens that most of these producers are&#13;
exporting a considerable portion of their production under a preferential&#13;
quota system to the European Community. Among this group of ACP countries are&#13;
such large sugar producers as Mauritius, Guyana, Fiji, Swaziland, Jamaica, and&#13;
Trinidad. A removal of all trade barriers would eliminate their monopoly&#13;
rents, which they currently derive from selling their exports to the European&#13;
Community at internal European Community prices. From data for 1978-79,&#13;
Schmitz and Koester (1981) estimate that the foreign exchange equivalent of&#13;
the monopoly rent for the six countries mentioned above is about US$380&#13;
million.23-   Given similar protection levels of the European Community for&#13;
1978-79 and 1983, this figure gives some indication of the likely overestimate&#13;
of the foreign exchange gains of developing countries for the year 1983. The&#13;
figure for the average of 1979-81 should be somewhat smaller as a result of&#13;
the smaller differences between internal European Community prices and the&#13;
world market price for that time period. Of the countries included in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
study, several also belong to the ACP group--namely, Kenya, Madagascar,&#13;
Tanzania, Uganda, and India. However, none of them is actually treated as an&#13;
ACP country along the lines discussed in the theoretical section.-24      The&#13;
quota for Kenya, Madagascar, and India is rather small when compared to total&#13;
exports. Hence their export unit values are not significantly affected for&#13;
the years 1979-81. Tanzania and Uganda, however, were actually importers&#13;
rather than exporters of sugar in the base period.&#13;
When we compare the results in tables 1 and 2 with the findings of&#13;
other studies, several problems arise. First, commodity definitions often&#13;
differ. Kirmani, Molajoni, and Mayer (1984), for example, use broad&#13;
aggregates such as meat or cereals rather than specific commodities such as&#13;
beef or wheat. Similarly, Anderson and Tyers (1983) study coarse grains&#13;
rather than maize and ruminant meat instead of beef. Valdes and Zietz (1980)&#13;
distinguish between raw sugar and refined sugar, whereas the current study is&#13;
confined to total sugar in raw equivalents. Second, few studies use the same&#13;
base period. The study of Valdes and Zietz (1980) is based on 1975-77&#13;
averages, as is the work by Koester (1982); Anderson and Tyers (1983) take&#13;
1980 as their reference year; and the current study utilizes an average of the&#13;
years 1979-81, as do Kirmani, Molajoni, and Mayer (1984). Third, the&#13;
calculation of protection levels generally differs among studies. Rather&#13;
large differences of protection levels are reported by Kirmani, Molajoni, and&#13;
Mayer (1984, table 1), for example, for a number of surveyed studies.&#13;
Finally, the methodology employed for a study of trade liberalization can be&#13;
different enough to make comparisons of results rather meaningless.25/ In the&#13;
light of the above problems, most of the following comparisons have to be&#13;
viewed with caution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
The long-run steady-state results reported by Anderson and Tyers&#13;
(1983) are similar in spirit to the comparative static results of this&#13;
study. Furthermore, they choose 1980 as their base year, which is very close&#13;
to the average of the years 1979-81 utilized in the current study. They&#13;
report world price increases for ruminant meat, wheat, and coarse grains of&#13;
24, 20, and 16 percent, respectively. These are somewhat larger than the&#13;
price increases given in table 1 for beef, wheat, and maize, the commodities&#13;
that match the more aggregate commodity groups chosen by Anderson and Tyers.&#13;
Almost identical numbers are generated for the projected increase in world&#13;
exports, however. Anderson and Tyers report export increases of 3.9, 7.5, and&#13;
24.4 million tons for ruminant meat, wheat, and coarse grains, respectively.&#13;
The corresponding figures from the current study are 3.7, 8.2, and 25.4&#13;
million tons if the benchmark elasticity results are taken.&#13;
In a recent study for FAO, Tangermann (1980) constructs a model of&#13;
the world beef market. According to his calculations, a complete removal of&#13;
trade barriers would result in a world price increase of 47 percent, a value&#13;
considerably above those reported in table 1. In addition, Tangermann&#13;
estimates that world exports would increase by 300 percent, which is about&#13;
twice the size of the values found in this study. One reason for the very&#13;
large percent changes predicted by Tangermann is his assumption that trade&#13;
barriers are not only removed in OECD countries but also in certain developing&#13;
countries with high protection levels, such as the Republic of Korea.&#13;
In comparing the current results with those of Valdes and Zietz&#13;
(1980), one has to keep in mind that the 1980 study is based on data for the&#13;
years 1975-77. In any case, the projected increases in developing country&#13;
export earnings from trade liberalization in sugar are quite similar in the&#13;
two studies--around 3 billion in 1980 U.S. dollars.2'     The increase in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
developing country export earnings calculated for beef, however, are from six&#13;
to seven times greater in the present study than they are in the 1980 study,&#13;
making beef rather than sugar the most promising candidate for trade&#13;
liberalization. The differences for wheat and maize are less pronounced than&#13;
for beef. Even so, the current figures for the benchmark elasticity runs are&#13;
still in the order of two to five times the 1980 results for maize and wheat,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
Koester (1982) also utilizes the methodology and basic data base of&#13;
Valdes and Zietz (1980), but concentrates on the analysis of cereals.&#13;
Assuming a complete removal of trade barriers in the European Community,&#13;
Koester predicts an increase in the world price of wheat and maize of 9.6 and&#13;
2.2 percent, respectively. Both percentage increases are below those of table&#13;
1. However, they are based on the assumption that trade barriers are removed&#13;
only in the European Community. Koester finds, as we do (see the last column&#13;
of table 1), that trade liberalization in cereals as a whole results in a net&#13;
welfare loss to developing countries, although their foreign exchange earnings&#13;
increase by more than US$1 billion.&#13;
Two recent studies, Koester and Schmitz (1982) and Roberts (1982),&#13;
analyze the effects of trade liberalization in sugar. In contrast to this&#13;
study, they examine the impact of the sugar policy only on the European&#13;
Community. When they take into account the income transfers derived from&#13;
preferential access to the high-price European Community market under its&#13;
Sugar Protocol, Koester and Schmitz conclude that a removal of European&#13;
Community trade barriers would actually result in a net loss to the ACP&#13;
countries. In contrast, Roberts calculates that developing countries could&#13;
expect an increase in welfare of between US$370 million and US$570 million&#13;
compared with a loss to the ACP countries under the Sugar Protocol of around&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
US$170 million. Unfortunately, Robert's results cannot be directly compared&#13;
to the figures reported in this study because of different assumptions&#13;
regarding the scope of trade liberalization.&#13;
Table 3 analyzes the relative significance to developing countries of&#13;
the foreign exchange earnings reported in table 1. Column (2) relates the&#13;
absolute increase in export earnings to their preliberalization levels. For&#13;
all commodities, the percentage changes are quite substantial, especially for&#13;
beef. Column (3) shows how developing countries would benefit from trade&#13;
liberalization relative to developed countries. For sugar, almost all of the&#13;
potential gains of trade liberalization go to the developing countries. The&#13;
only developed country also benefitting from trade liberalization in sugar is&#13;
Australia. All other developed countries lose because most have high current&#13;
levels of protection. Trade liberalization in beef and veal, however,&#13;
increases export earnings about equally for developed country exporters and&#13;
the developing countries. Among the developed countries, Australia and the&#13;
United States have by far the most to gain from trade liberalization in&#13;
beef. The distribution of benefits among developed and developing countries&#13;
for the two cereals is very different. Most of the increase in foreign&#13;
exchange earnings goes to the large developed country exporters--the United&#13;
States, Canada, and Australia.&#13;
Columns (4) and (5) of table 3 compare the potential foreign exchange&#13;
gains of developing countries to the inflow of official development aid. For&#13;
sugar and beef together, the potential increase in developing country export&#13;
earnings amounts to one-quarter of total average OECD aid for the year 1979 to&#13;
1981 if the calculations are based on the most conservative assumptions. The&#13;
percentage rises to almost 50 percent if one assumes a strong supply response&#13;
of developed countries. If developing country export earnings are related to&#13;

Note: Superscripts refer to various assumptions with respect to the supply&#13;

on 1983 protection levels. Developed countries in column (3) exclude the European&#13;
Community. The average development aid of OECD countries used in column (4) is from&#13;
the World Development Report 1983, p. 182. Official aid to agriculture in column&#13;

Agriculture. The raw data are from OECD, 1983, p. 138. The average 1979-81 cereal&#13;
import bill in column (6) is from FAO Trade Yearbook. It refers to imports of&#13;
market economy developing countries. The individual year figures are deflated by&#13;
the world wholesale price index from the International Monetary Fund, International&#13;

negligible.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
total 1980 aid commitments to food and agriculture, one can find values&#13;
ranging from 60 to almost 120 percent, depending on the assumptions. Even&#13;
though the ratios in both column (4) and (5) seem quite high, they are likely&#13;
to be underestimated because the foreign exchange earnings of the fifty-eight&#13;
developing countries included in the present study are compared with the&#13;
development aid going to all developing countries. A similar argument applies&#13;
to column (6), which relates the predicted change in the foreign exchange&#13;
earnings of the developing countries under consideration to the cereal import&#13;
bill of developing countries classified as market economies by FAQ.&#13;
Table 4 presents export market shares before and after trade&#13;
liberalization for all model runs based on benchmark elasticity assumptions.&#13;
The figures support the earlier conclusion that developing countries as a&#13;
whole benefit from trade liberalization in sugar and beef. Their share of&#13;
world exports increases substantially for both commodities, whereas the share&#13;
going to developed countries outside the European Community drops. Table 4&#13;
also highlights the dominance of developed country exporters in the market for&#13;
cereals. According to the model simulations, this dominance is likely to&#13;
increase through trade liberalization. An interesting result is the&#13;
elimination of the European Community as a net exporter for all of the&#13;
commodities under study.&#13;
The considerable increases in the export earnings of developing&#13;
countries reported in tables 1 through 3 do not imply that all these countries&#13;
share equally in absolute or relative terms in the gains from trade&#13;
liberalization. This fact is supported by table 5, which lists the countries&#13;
most affected in absolute terms. From this table, we see that, in absolute&#13;
terms, the potential gains associated with trade liberalization are heavily&#13;

concentrated among a few developing countries. For the commodities under&#13;
study, Argentina, Brazil, and India seem to benefit by far the most in&#13;
absolute terms. A more detailed analyis of table 5 reveals that the three-&#13;
country concentration ratio of foreign exchange gains varies considerably&#13;
among commodities. For sugar and maize, about two-thirds of the total change&#13;
in developing country export earnings accrues to three countries. For beef,&#13;
this share rises to more than three-quarters, and for wheat to 95 percent.&#13;
Despite the large gains to only a few countries, many smaller developing&#13;
countries can also expect substantial increases in foreign exchange. For many&#13;
of them, the relative changes are substantially greater than they are for the&#13;
large countries of table 5. Moreover, a considerable number of countries only&#13;
turn into exporters as a result of trade liberalization. (For more details on&#13;
these last points, the interested reader is referred to appendix B, which&#13;
provides individual country results for all model runs based on benchmark&#13;
elasticity assumptions.)&#13;
Another way to break down the results of this study is presented in&#13;
table 6, which analyzes the potential impact of trade liberalization on the&#13;
group of low-income countries. For the purposes of this study, low-income&#13;
countries are those developing countries with a 1981 per capita gross national&#13;
product of US$400 or less, according to the World Development Report 1983. Of&#13;
the developing countries included in this study, twenty-two are categorized as&#13;
low-income countries. According to column (2), low-income countries as a&#13;
group suffer a welfare loss from trade liberalization in cereals. This&#13;
conclusion is similar to the one derived for all developing countries in table&#13;
1. Column (3) of table 6 expresses the foreign exchange gains of low-income&#13;
countries as a percentage of the gains of all fifty-eight developing&#13;

countries. The most notable result is probably the low percentage of foreign&#13;
exchange gains from beef that accrue to low-income countries. Trade&#13;
liberalization in beef, in other words, is mainly in the interest of middle-&#13;
or high-income developing countries, particularly those of Latin America. At&#13;
the same time, the gains to developing countries from free trade in sugar are&#13;
quite considerable. A comparison of columns (3) and (4) shows that India is&#13;
the low-income country with by far the largest potential gains. The share of&#13;
foreign exchange gains going to the group of low-income countries apart from&#13;
India seems rather low. But again, one has to consider that, for a small&#13;
developing country, even a negligible share of total benefits may translate&#13;
into a substantial amount of foreign exchange, in both absolute and relative&#13;
terms. (See appendix B for individual cases.)&#13;

Tables 7 to 10 provide a regional account of the impact of trade&#13;
liberalization on developing countries. Only the results for the benchmark&#13;
elasticity runs of the model are reported. A change to higher domestic supply&#13;
elasticities does not appreciably affect the regional impact.27/ For sugar&#13;
(table 7), Asia and Latin America share about equally in the potential gains&#13;
of trade liberalization. Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa and the Middle&#13;
East, in particular, are net losers with respect to welfare. For beef, the&#13;
potential gains are almost exclusively concentrated in Latin America, at least&#13;
in absolute terms. All other regions suffer net welfare losses, although they&#13;
are rather small in the case of sub-Saharan Africa. The latter region can&#13;
increase its foreign exchange earnings by a rather substantial percentage.&#13;
The same also applies to North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Trade&#13;
liberalization in wheat leads to welfare losses in all four regions. Most of&#13;
the foreign exchange earnings accrue to Asia, particularly to India. Wheat is&#13;
also the only commodity of the four analyzed in which North Africa and the&#13;
Middle East could expect to share more than just marginally in the foreign&#13;
exchange gains of trade liberalization. The individual country results&#13;
provided in appendix B, however, reveal that essentially all of the gains go&#13;
to one country, Turkey. In the case of trade liberalization in maize, only&#13;
Latin America could expect to register net welfare gains. For sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa, however, the model predicts a large percentage increase in foreign&#13;
exchange earnings.&#13;

5. Conclusion&#13;
This study has analyzed the potential benefits to developing&#13;
countries of trade liberalization in beef and sugar as well as the two cereals&#13;
wheat and maize. The results seem to support the conclusion that trade&#13;
liberalization in cereals would likely lead to a net welfare loss to&#13;
developing countries as a whole, although a number of these countries could&#13;
expect considerable percentage increases in foreign exchange earnings. This&#13;
conclusion applies in particular to the case of wheat. According to results&#13;
obtained with the model, most of the gains of trade liberalization in cereals&#13;
would accrue to the large developed country exporters, namely, the United&#13;
States, Canada, and Australia, at the expense of the members of the European&#13;
Community.&#13;
In contrast to the case of cereals, trade liberalization in sugar and&#13;
beef would probably be of benefit to the developing countries. For both&#13;
commodities together, a complete removal of tariff barriers could result in&#13;
net welfare gains of US$250 million to more than US$1.5 billion per year,&#13;
depending on the underlying assumptions.28- The corresponding increase in&#13;
foreign exchange earnings could be anywhere from US$6.6 billion to more than&#13;
US$12 billion per year, again depending on the assumptions regarding supply&#13;
elasticities and protection levels.29/ For just two commodities, these&#13;
numbers are very large, not only in absolute terms but also when compared with&#13;
the preliberalization export earnings of developing countries or the flow of&#13;
development aid to these countries.&#13;
Trade liberalization in sugar benefits developing countries almost&#13;
exclusively. Only a fraction of the total increase in export earnings is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
expected to be captured by developed country exporters. This is somewhat&#13;
different for beef, for which total benefits, if measured in terms of foreign&#13;
exchange, are split about equally among developed and developing countries.&#13;
As for the regional distribution of benefits, both Latin America and Asia&#13;
could expect about half of total developing country foreign exchange increases&#13;
resulting from trade liberalization in sugar. Latin America has the most to&#13;
gain from a removal of tariffs on beef. It would capture 92 percent of the&#13;
foreign exchange gains going to developing countries. The countries of North&#13;
Africa and the Middle East are likely to suffer a net welfare loss from trade&#13;
liberalization in both sugar and beef. Sub-Saharan Africa could expect to&#13;
realize substantial percentage increases in foreign exchange earnings from all&#13;
commodities except wheat.&#13;
Overall, the predicted gains to developing countries from trade&#13;
liberalization in beef and sugar are quite substantial. They certainly do not&#13;
support some recent pessimistic appraisals of the effects of trade&#13;
liberalization in temperate-zone agricultural products (Matthew 1984). To put&#13;
the reported results in the proper perspective, one must remember that these&#13;
results have to be interpreted as static gains or losses. Some rudimentary&#13;
efforts have been made to capture at least part of what may be called dynamic&#13;
gains through the use of larger supply elasticities for developing countries&#13;
in alternative model runs. It is unlikely, however, that all of the potential&#13;
benefits of trade liberlization to developing countries are captured by these&#13;
model simulations. As pointed out by Valdes and Zietz (1980), "permanently&#13;
reducing trade barriers would lead the [developing countries] to develop new&#13;
export products, including the expansion of their own processing operations.&#13;
In addition, it would probably encourage [developing countries] to concentrate&#13;
more resources on increasing agricultural production." Trade liberalization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
is, in other words, likely to break the current climate of "export pessimism"&#13;
that inhibits the adoption of export-oriented policies in the agricultural&#13;
sector. As a result, the overall development performance of many developing&#13;
countries could be expected to improve perceptively.&#13;

1/   For constant   r  and  m,   ph  is negative; that is, the domestic price&#13;
decreases if the ratio of post- to preliberalization world price is smaller&#13;
than (1+tO)/(l+tl), or in case of a complete elimination of tariffs, if the&#13;
world price increase, pwh, is smaller than the preliberalization tariff, tO.&#13;
2/   Here, as in all other cases, domestic demand-and-supply elasticities are&#13;
assumed to be constant. Equations (1) and (2) then give the exact changes&#13;
in C and Q, even for large variations in p.&#13;
3/   The expressions in parentheses are the small change equivalents of&#13;
equations (1) and (2) in the text.&#13;
4/ The authors thank Ron Duncan of the World Bank for pointing out this&#13;
special case.&#13;
5/ The determining equation for dVM implies that developing countries are&#13;
forced to import at the world market price in the postliberalization period,&#13;
irrespective of possible differences in transportation costs, quality&#13;
differences, and the like. This simplifying assumption is likely to&#13;
overestimate the losses that would be incurred by developing countries if&#13;
inexpensive Australian beef exports were discontinued.&#13;
6/   This category includes all types of raw sugar and refined sugar.&#13;
7/   The following ACP countries are excluded from the calculation of the&#13;
world export unit value: Barbados, Fiji, Guyana, Jamaica, Mauritius, and&#13;
Trinidad and Tobago.&#13;
8/   The larger the set of commodities incorporated in a study, the greater is&#13;
the possibility of interdependencies among commodities. In a partial&#13;
equilibrium setting it is thus advisable to adjust the own-elasticities&#13;
downward. In an earlier study, (Valdes and Zietz 1980), we considered ninety-&#13;
nine rather than just four commodities. In keeping-with the above logic, a&#13;
supply elasticity of 0.4 was used, a value below or more conservative than the&#13;
one employed in the current study.&#13;
9/   See also Peterson (1979) for a strong argument in favor of an aggregate&#13;
supply elasticity around 1.2 for developing countries.&#13;
10/   The world price, pwO, is not used to calculate protection levels because&#13;
it does not allow for differences in transport costs or the composition of&#13;
imports from country to country. The latter is particularly relevant because&#13;
the commodity definitions used in this study are quite broad.&#13;
11/   Here, as in all other cases, the Belgian price is taken to represent the&#13;
price for the table entry Belgium/Luxembourg in the Appendix. Since no beet&#13;
prices are reported for Denmark for the years 1979 to 1981, the beet prices in&#13;
Krona were derived from the 1975 price using the producer price index for&#13;
sugar beet as reported in European Community Agricultural Price Indices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
(January 1984). The Krona prices were converted into ECU using the implicit&#13;
conversion rate for crystallized sugar (Agricultural Price Statistics 1983,&#13;
table 1540).&#13;
12/   The 1983 protection levels for the European Community as well as those&#13;
for all other developed countries are presented in appendix B.&#13;
13/   Its calculation corresponds to the one described above, except that the&#13;
import unit value of Sweden was used for Austria, Sweden itself, and&#13;
Switzerland. The 1978 import unit value of Switzerland was judged an&#13;
unreliable indicator of the border price of total sugar. Switzerland imports&#13;
refined sugar almost exclusively. This caused the import unit value for total&#13;
sugar to be biased upward considerably for 1978, quite unlike the years 1978&#13;
to 1981.&#13;
14/   See Saxon and Anderson (1982, table 8) for historical evidence.     Imports&#13;
are restricted to boneless beef to minimize the danger of importing the hoof&#13;
and mouth disease.&#13;
15/   Such as U.S imported beef, frozen, boneless, 90 percent visible lean,&#13;
f.o.b. port of entry as quoted for example in Singh (1983, p. 86).&#13;
16/   What is referred to is the partial redundancy of the official threshold&#13;
price for wheat exporters.&#13;
17/   Unless otherwise noted, developing countries refers to the fifty-eight&#13;
countries included in the study.&#13;
18/   For beef, the supply elasticities of all European Community countries&#13;
and Japan are reduced to 0.4. For wheat and maize, the default supply&#13;
elasticities of all developing countries is doubled to 0.8.&#13;
19/   They are identified by superscript 1.&#13;
20/   The change in net welfare is calculated as the difference between the&#13;
welfare increases enjoyed by developing country exporters and the welfare&#13;
losses incurred by developing country importers.&#13;
21/   The following refers to the sugar price of the International Sugar&#13;
Organization as quoted, for example, by Singh (1983).&#13;
22/   It is calculated as the ratio of the European Community threshold price*&#13;
of raw sugar to its c.i.f. Rotterdam price.&#13;
23/   The figures are taken from the authors' table 14 and are converted into&#13;
1980 U.S dollars using the 1978 $/ECU exchange rate and the world wholesale&#13;
price index from the International Financial Statistics.&#13;
24/   In the case of beef, only two countries, Kenya and Madagascar, met the&#13;
conditions explained in the theoretical section that call for special&#13;
treatment of ACP countries.&#13;
25/   See, for example, the study by Fischer and Frohberg (1984).&#13;

26/   This takes into account the different assumptions regarding the&#13;
percentage reduction in tariffs between the two studies.&#13;
27/   Neither does the replacement of 1979-81 prices and protection levels by&#13;
1983 values for the case of sugar.&#13;
28/   All value terms are expressed in 1980 U.S. dollars.&#13;
29/   It should be pointed out that larger numbers than those reported can be&#13;
obtained if certain model assumption are combined, such as very large supply&#13;
elasticities and protection levels of developed countries with very elastic&#13;
supply responses of developing countries.&#13;

Appendix A&#13;
Input Data by Commodity and Country&#13;
In the following pages we present the raw data, by commodity, for the&#13;
calculations described in the theoretical section.30/ The notation&#13;
corresponds to that used elsewhere in the study. X0 stands for net exports,&#13;
MO for net imports, QO for production, CO for consumption. The subscript&#13;
0 indicates pre-liberalization levels.31/ All four quantity variables are&#13;
averages for the years 1979 to 1981. The dimension is thousands of metric&#13;
tons. Blanks appear for countries that were neither importing nor exporting&#13;
in the base period. It is assumed that trade liberalization would not change&#13;
this situation. Economically, this can be rationalized by assuming that&#13;
domestic demand and supply elasticities are the same in absolute terms. The&#13;
latter are denoted by eC,p and eQ,p, respectively. For developed&#13;
countries, the nominal rate of protection (tO) is given whenever it exceeds&#13;
zero. For some developed countries two values are presented for tO. The&#13;
first one is the nominal protection rate relevant to producers indicating the&#13;
percentage rate by which the domestic producer price exceeds the world market&#13;
price. The second tO-value gives the percentage rate by which the domestic&#13;
wholesale price exceeds the world market price.&#13;
30/   The export and import unit values for each country and commodity are not&#13;
listed because they can be easily obtained from the 1981 FAO Trade Yearbook.&#13;
31/   No subscripts or superscripts are used in the following listings.&#13;

Appendix B&#13;
Individual Country Results by Commodity&#13;
The following listings contain detailed country results for all model&#13;
runs with benchmark elasticities. The column headings correspond to the&#13;
respective equations in the theoretical section. For developed countries&#13;
outside the European Community and the members of the community, the change in&#13;
consumption (DC), the change in production (DQ), and the postliberalization&#13;
levels of exports (X1) and imports (Ml) are given. The column TRVIM provides&#13;
the postliberalization level of imports of a country with a trade reversal&#13;
from an exporting to an importing status. Similarly, TRVEX gives the post-&#13;
liberalization level of exports of'a country with a trade reversal from a net-&#13;
importing to a net-exporting status. MIEC represents the postliberalization&#13;
import level of the,.EurQpean community as trading entity, XlEC the&#13;
corresponding export, level. For the-sugar results based on 1983 protection&#13;
levels, the corresponding levels of tO are added in a separate column. All&#13;
quantities are in thousands of metric tons.&#13;
For developing countries, the following results are presented: the&#13;
change in welfare of exporters and-countries with a trade reversal from a net-&#13;
importing to a net-exporting status (DWX), the change in foreign exchange&#13;
earnings (DVX), the preliberalization level of foreign exchange earnings&#13;
(VXO), the percentage change in foreign exchange earnings (percentage change&#13;
VX), the change in the import'bill'(DVM),' and the change in welfare of net-&#13;
importing developing countries'or APC countries that experience a trade&#13;

reversal from a net-exporting-to a net-importing status (DWM).    All, numbers&#13;
except the percentage changes are expressed i-n thousands of 1980 U.S. dollars;&#13;
"na" indicates that the country was a net importer in the preliberalization&#13;
period, and "Low Inc." sums the respective column over all low-income&#13;
c6untries as defined in the data sectiofn.. The low-income category for;Latin&#13;
America consists solely of Haiti and thus has not been separated in the&#13;
listings.&#13;

            The costs of protectionism to developing
            countries : an analysis for selected agricultural products
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The purpose of this study is to quantify
            the welfare and foreign exchange costs that arise in
            developing countries as a result of the protectionist
            policies pursued by developed countries with respect to many
            agricultural products. A detailed analysis is presented for
            four key commodities: sugar, beef, wheat, and maize. For
            each commodity, the potential gains to developing countries
            from a complete removal of tariff and nontariff barriers in
            developed countries are analyzed within the framework of a
            comparative-static world market equilibrium model. The study
            considers fifty-eight developing countries as well as
            seventeen developed countries.
