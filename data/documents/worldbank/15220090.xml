  STUDY AIMS AND METHODS&#13;
  The purpose of Phase II of the ESI study is to provide&#13;
  sanitation decision makers with improved evidence on the&#13;
  costs and benefits of alternative sanitation options in differ-&#13;
  ent contexts in the Philippines. The study focuses on human&#13;
  excreta management, covering six selected field sites as well&#13;
  as national surveys.&#13;
&#13;
  Surveys	were	conducted	in three rural and three urban sites&#13;
  that have recently been the focus of sanitation programs and&#13;
  projects (see Figure 1), involving overall 1,270 household&#13;

The findings suggest that low-cost technologies, particularly&#13;
improved wet pit latrines, are worth pursuing, especially for&#13;
low-income groups where these options are feasible. How-&#13;
ever, in densely populated urban centers, with limited options&#13;
for building UDDT structures and reuse options, the septic&#13;
tank with septage treatment and sewerage with treatment&#13;
are both economically attractive options. The environmental&#13;
benefits of improved sanitation have not been fully captured&#13;
in this study; including them would make treatment options&#13;
even more economically attractive.&#13;
&#13;
Under actual program conditions, there is also a significant&#13;
decline in economic performance. Septic tank with septage&#13;
management reduces from 4.3 to 3.4 and wet pit latrine from&#13;
4.5 to 2.8. This is due not only to non-use by some house-&#13;
holds or household members of the facilities, but also off-&#13;
site treatment facilities being utilized at well below their engi-&#13;
neered capacity.                                                     improvement plans, especially in situations where funds are&#13;

            The Economics of Sanitation Initiative
            (ESI) is a multi-country study launched in 2007 by the World
            Bank's Water and Sanitation Program to address major
            gaps in evidence among developing countries on the economic
            aspects of sanitation. Its objective is to provide economic
            evidence to increase the volumes and efficiency of public
            and private spending on sanitation. This research brief
            summarizes the key findings of study second phase,
            cost-benefit analysis of alternative sanitation options,
            from the Philippines.
