FOREWORD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is clear that climate change is increasingly affecting life on the planet. Average temperatures are rising, rainfall patterns are changing, and&#13;
weather is becoming highly volatile.&#13;
&#13;
At the World Bank Group, we consider climate change a fundamental threat to sustainable economic development and the fight against&#13;
poverty. We are concerned that without bold action now, the warming planet threatens to put prosperity out of reach of millions and to roll&#13;
back decades of development. It is our hope that shedding light on the various links between climate change and development will help&#13;
practitioners and governments to better respond to the challenges posed by global warming.&#13;
&#13;
This study focuses on livestock diseases that are â&#128;&#156;sensitiveâ&#128;&#157; to climate change, with a view to help practitioners reduce the risks of key&#13;
climate-sensitive infectious diseases by strengthening risk management systems for disease outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
The three diseases chosen for the studyâ&#128;&#148;Rift Valley fever, Bluetongue, and East Coast feverâ&#128;&#148;spread through â&#128;&#156;vectorsâ&#128;&#157; such as insects and&#13;
parasites, the prevalence of which fluctuates depending on key weather and climate variables such as temperature and humidity. As the&#13;
symptoms of climate change continue, the frequency and extent of these diseases are expected to escalate.&#13;
&#13;
This research highlights the need for better understanding of the evolving interactions between the environment and emerging and re-&#13;
emerging disease pathogens. It also points to the inseparable interactions between animal health and human health, which climate change&#13;
appears to be reinforcing and even diversifying. In this context, the burgeoning concept and approach of â&#128;&#156;one healthâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;defined as â&#128;&#156;the&#13;
collaborative effort of multiple disciplinesâ&#128;&#148;working locally, nationally, and globallyâ&#128;&#148;to attain optimal health for people, animals and the&#13;
environmentâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;becomes increasingly relevant.&#13;
&#13;
Going forward, it is clear that partnerships are essential to implementing the interventions recommended in this report (and those beyond)&#13;
and to facilitating the mobilization of information and knowledge, technical capacity, and financial resources. The Global Livestock Agenda&#13;
under development at the World Bank and the Livestock Global Alliance, with health, environment, and livelihoods at its core, envisages&#13;
accelerating and scaling up systematic and coordinated interventions, including those for climate-sensitive diseases.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                                                                                                   x iii&#13;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Disease risks to humans, animals, and plants are determined by interconnected environmental variables that affect incidence, transmission,&#13;
and outbreak. Climate change affects many of the environmental variables that lead to disease. Regardless of the species involved, the&#13;
impacts can ultimately affect the health, livelihood, and economic security of humans.&#13;
&#13;
The objective of this World Bank Economic and Sector Work is to build on scientific and operational knowledge of early action tools to help&#13;
practitioners reduce the risks of key climate-sensitive infectious diseases by strengthening risk management systems for disease outbreaks.&#13;
The report includes an assessment of known interventions such as the establishment of surveillance systems, the development of region-&#13;
and nation-specific disease outlooks, the creation of climate-sensitive disease risk maps, and the construction and implementation of early&#13;
warning advisory systems. The assessment then looks at proposed investments that can lead to the development of these tools, working&#13;
toward reducing global climate-sensitive disease risk.&#13;
&#13;
Because of the breadth of species affected by climate-sensitive disease, it has been helpful to select a model through which the specific&#13;
impact of climate change and disease can be traced. In this instance, livestock has been chosen, given its significant global presence,&#13;
economic importance, and susceptibility to disease outbreak. The livestock sector plays a vital role in the economies of many develop-&#13;
ing countries. Globally it accounts for 40 percent of agricultural gross domestic product (GDP). It employs 1.3 billion people and creates&#13;
livelihoods for 1 billion of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poor. Livestock products provide one-third of human protein intake and are a potential remedy&#13;
for undernourishment. Climate-sensitive diseases pose a permanent threat to this important sector, and disease outbreaks have major&#13;
economic implicationsâ&#128;&#148;both through private and public costs of the outbreak and through the costs of the measures taken at individual,&#13;
collective, and international levels to prevent or control infection and disease outbreaks. Yet despite increasing evidence, including the&#13;
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ&#128;&#153;s Fourth Assessment Report that linked climate variability and change to the emergence and&#13;
re-emergence of infectious disease, concrete actions to address the climate impacts on disease outbreaks and livelihoods remain lagging.&#13;
The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s World Development Report 2010 estimated the costs associated with climate-sensitive health impacts to be as high as&#13;
9Â percent of GDP in some countries. Investments to reduce climate-associated diseases and health risks are only about 1â&#128;&#147;2 percent of overall&#13;
climate sector investments.&#13;
&#13;
There are many climate-sensitive livestock diseases; virtually any that are dependent on vectors or are waterborne could be included on this&#13;
list. To narrow the scope, three of particular economic and health importance were chosen: Rift Valley fever (RVF), Bluetongue (BT), and East&#13;
Coast fever (ECF). Rift Valley fever is a vector-borne viral disease transmitted by several species of mosquitoes that have facilitated epidemics&#13;
in Africa and in the Arabian Peninsula, with dramatic impact on animal and human health due to its zoonotic dimension. Bluetongue is a&#13;
vector-borne viral disease transmitted by several species of Culicoides midges. The disease is endemic to many tropical climates, though it&#13;
has invaded Europe in the last decades with a massive economic impact, mainly through disruption of trade. East Coast fever is a vector-&#13;
borne parasitic disease transmitted by ticks that is endemic in many southeast African countries, where it has a continuous and significant&#13;
economic impact. The vector-borne nature of each implies climate sensitivity.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Livestock diseases can be classified and ranked according to various criteria, such as overall economic impact, impact on livelihood, poten-&#13;
       tial to adapt and invade a new host and become zoonotic, potential to spread into new geographical areas, or a combination of these. The&#13;
       relative impact of each of these diseases is highly specific to the region and the capacity of agricultural and health systems to mitigate the&#13;
       effects. Furthermore, global data on each of these three, which can be taken as a sample of other climate-sensitive diseases, are incomplete&#13;
       and variable in quality and by type of disease, making it difficult to assess comprehensive economic impact. The data for health impacts on&#13;
       humans are even less robust, highlighting the need for individual case studies to clarify total costs.&#13;
&#13;
       Bearing in mind these limitations, rough estimates of costs can be assessed, providing a reference point for decision makers. For example,&#13;
       RVF epidemics in Somalia have prevented 8.2 million small ruminants, 110,000 camels, and 57,000 cattle from being exported, correspond-&#13;
       ing to economic losses for the livestock industry estimated at $109 million in 1998â&#128;&#147;99 and $326 million in 2000â&#128;&#147;02. For Bluetongue, in the&#13;
       Netherlands alone the 2006 and 2007 epidemics had net costs of 32.4 million and 164â&#128;&#147;175 million euros, respectively. The annual cost of&#13;
       ECF is estimated as $88.6 million in Kenya, $2.6 million in Malawi, $133.9 million in Tanzania, and $8.8 million in Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
       The impact of climate change on diseases is not unique to livestock. Human, plant, and other animal diseases are all affected by changing&#13;
       climatic conditions. Further, each affects the other and can lead to serious harm to economic and human well-being. Plant and animal&#13;
       diseases can lead to malnutrition and famine in humans, and many animal and human diseases can be exchanged via zoonotic (animal to&#13;
       human) or anthroponotic (human to animal) transmission.&#13;
&#13;
       One Health is a recognized framework that acknowledges the systemic connectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. These&#13;
       considerations have long been important to health care practitioners, as humans have historically lived intimately in the environment. As&#13;
       cities have emerged, as technology progressed, and as allopathic medicine become the predominant medical paradigm, this inherent&#13;
       understanding about disease and health has been displaced by disciplinary silos. In recent decades, however, renewed interest in jointly&#13;
       considering these different spheres of health has occurred. Global trends in environmental change, travel, population growth, and the live-&#13;
       stock industry have resulted in a booming era of emerging infectious disease (EIDs). A total of 335 EIDs have been identified in humans since&#13;
       1940, of which three-quarters are zoonotic, including HIV, Ebola, SARS, and avian influenza. Climate is thought to have a role in some of these&#13;
       emergent events; for example, recent work has suggested that variations in climate may have established environmental conditions ripe&#13;
       for avian influenzaâ&#128;&#148;a disease with catastrophic financial impacts that span sectors as diverse as livestock, tourism, trade, and health care.&#13;
&#13;
       The additional effect of climate change on health is difficult to calculate for one species, let alone for collaborative health systems that&#13;
       include humans, animals, and the environment. Nevertheless, in pairing what is known about the effect of climate change on the health of&#13;
       one species with what is known about how the health of one species affects another, logic can help us see how climate change is undeni-&#13;
       ably linked to health in many spheres of life. It is not necessary to establish clear causal links between climate change and environmental&#13;
       change before adaptation strategies can be developed and implemented.&#13;
&#13;
       In order to identify approaches to reducing these disease risks (and costs), it is important to understand the pressure points where climate&#13;
       affects disease. Climate may influence virtually all components of disease systems: the pathogen (for example, influencing the development&#13;
       rate or the survival outside the host or vector), the host (through the immune response or changes in host distribution), and the vectors&#13;
       (arthropod vector development is tightly linked to climatic parameters such as temperature and humidity). In addition, climate change and&#13;
       climate variability may strongly influence disease by indirect effects such as the movements of hosts resulting from floods or heat waves or&#13;
       climate-induced changes in land use or land cover.&#13;
&#13;
       People in developing regions are particularly vulnerable to negative economic, social, and health impacts resulting from climate change.&#13;
       Human vulnerability (inclusive of health, economics, livelihoods) is affected by the vulnerability of animalsâ&#128;&#153; health to climate change, but&#13;
       this has been the focus of few studies. Reducing climate-sensitive livestock disease risks overall can be aided by understanding how both&#13;

&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                                                                                                 xv&#13;

animals and humans are vulnerable to climate change so that collaborative and comprehensive systems can be developed to increase&#13;
resilience.&#13;
&#13;
Through upstream disease prevention efforts, the health, livelihood, and economic security of downstream human populations can be&#13;
protected. The tools identified and assessed in this report for upstream prevention include surveillance systems, disease outlooks, disease&#13;
risk maps, and early warning systems (EWS).&#13;
&#13;
    ï¿½	 Surveillance systems are key to knowing where and when a disease will occur, providing baseline data for risk models. Both active&#13;
       and passive surveillance are important tools that can be used to generate most-accurate disease profiles. Geospatial and informa-&#13;
       tion technology is increasingly important for developing accurate surveillance methodologies.&#13;
    ï¿½	 Risk maps rely heavily on the appropriate collection of disease data. They enable better prioritization of surveillance, prevention, and&#13;
       mitigation efforts. In many studies, risk maps have consisted of mapping the distribution of vectors; recent works enable modeling&#13;
       diseases themselves.&#13;
    ï¿½	 Disease outlooks aim to provide long-term projection of disease trends so that disease control and mitigation efforts can be inte-&#13;
       grated into long-term planning. Unfortunately, few disease outlooks are yet available for any diseases.&#13;
    ï¿½	 Early warning systems aim to provide short or midterm disease forecasting so that appropriate interventions and mitigation efforts&#13;
       can reduce the impact of an epidemic. Climate-based EWS have been developed for RVF in East Africa and have proved useful in&#13;
       predicting recent outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
Preparing climate-sensitive disease risk-reduction tools requires basic levels of underlying infrastructure in a number of areas: knowledge,&#13;
policy, human resources, information and communication technology, and physical building. Investment in individual project compo-&#13;
nents in each of these infrastructure areas will help build the capacities of countries so that they can effectively implement and use risk&#13;
management tools. Many of the actions and project components leading to the strengthening of this infrastructure are interrelated and&#13;
co-dependent, necessitating investment packages that address a portfolio of needs. Further, the actions required to bolster underlying&#13;
infrastructure are not necessarily specific to any one disease, and investment in project components that lead to improved infrastructure&#13;
can have co-benefits for a variety of non-disease-related development needs. (See following page for detail.)&#13;
&#13;
Building an investment package requires a chronological deployment of activities. A three-phased approach has been recommended.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Phase 1:&#13;
&#13;
        ï¿½	 Knowledge: Needs assessments and baseline surveys of basic capacities of institutions, individuals, and technical and physical&#13;
           infrastructures&#13;
   Phase 2:&#13;
&#13;
        ï¿½	 Information and communication technology (ICT): Climate-sensitive disease web-portals inclusive of integrated EWS&#13;
           information, risk maps, disease outlooks&#13;
           Â­&#13;
        ï¿½	 ICT: Mapping, geographic information system (GIS), and modeling software&#13;
        ï¿½	 ICT: New and/or integrated with current hydro-met information systems&#13;
        ï¿½	 Human Resources: Workforce trainings (policy makers, veterinarians, physicians, environmental scientists, communication&#13;
           experts, others) through short courses, workshops, and sponsored advanced degree programs on general climate-sensitive&#13;
           disease information as well as specialized technical aspects of the work (for example, disease diagnostics, GIS, computer&#13;
           programming)&#13;
        ï¿½	 Policy: Coordinated animal healthâ&#128;&#147;human health collaboration mechanisms through, for example, committees and cross-&#13;
           sectoral working groups at national/regional levels&#13;
   Phase 3:&#13;
&#13;
        ï¿½	 ICT: EWS messages disseminated through new media of websites, mobile phones, social media&#13;

SCOPE OF THIS REPORT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The risk of disease to humans, animals, and plants is determined by interconnected factors of political, structural, organizational and technical&#13;
nature. Environmental variables affect incidence, transmission, and spread. In this Economic and Sector Work, we focus only on the additional&#13;
risk posed by climate change, which affects many of the environmental variables that lead to disease. We further narrow the scope by focusing&#13;
on livestock. Many of the lessons learned from this exercise are transferrable to other diseases, including those that also affect humans. Through&#13;
upstream disease prevention efforts, the health, livelihood, and economic security of downstream human populations can be protected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Audience&#13;
This report was written as guidance for investment and project implementation to reduce risks from climate-sensitive disease. Internal&#13;
World Bank audiences that stand to benefit the most are Task Team Leaders (TTLs) in countries and regions that are interested in developing&#13;
coordinated programs incorporating agricultural, health, and environmental activities. Given the cross-cutting themes identified, TTLs with&#13;
interests in any of these disciplines singularly may also benefit from learning of the co-benefits of inter-sectoral investment and action.&#13;
Audiences external to the World Bank who may be interested in this work include governments, agencies, and nongovernmental organiza-&#13;
tions working at any of the intersections of agriculture, health, and environment.&#13;

     The figures provided in the preceding section demonstrate that             case reports and targeted surveys. The available economic impact&#13;
     while RVF, BT, and ECF have a substantial economic impact, the             assessments relate primarily to the number of outbreaks and to&#13;
     estimates vary considerably in terms of the extent and level at            the morbidity and mortality in animals and people. In these cir-&#13;

     For BT, the developed countries affected by outbreaks generally&#13;

       were flooded, and within those, there were many sites where                    weather stations or remote sensing modalities) and ancillary data&#13;
       we knew that RVF outbreaks had occurred in the past and that                   (that is, spatial distribution of livestock and breeds). These three&#13;
       we hence considered as high risk.&#13;
                                                                                      types of surveillance data can then be used to build reliable risk&#13;
       So, we combined the forecasted risk map with our local knowl-                  maps and disease outlooks, which can in turn be aggregated to&#13;
       edge to conclude that there was a very high risk of RVF out-&#13;

       breaks, and that those outbreaks would be concentrated in&#13;
       those areas. So, we took the decision to concentrate our distri-               warning systems (see figure 2.3.) In effect, EWS are the overarch-&#13;

   the countries themselves for such systems. However, there are&#13;
   today few climate-based early warning systems used to influ-&#13;
   ence disease control decisions.&#13;
&#13;
   There are many reasons for this. In some instances, climate is&#13;
   one of the many determinants of diseases, and the complex-&#13;
   ity of integrating all factors becomes a real obstacle. In other&#13;
   instances, systems are in place, but address no real stakehold-&#13;
   ers who could convert the system outputs into actions. Other&#13;
   problems can be a lack of added value of the system over the&#13;
   knowledge of the users in the field.&#13;
&#13;
   I think that in the future, one should pay attention to embed&#13;
   risk mapping and EWS into operational decision support&#13;
   systems, to share lessons and systems with other hazards for&#13;
   which EWS have been developed successfully, and to evaluate&#13;
   the benefit of those systems against criteria that are relevant&#13;

            Reducing climate-sensitive disease risks
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Disease risks to humans, animals, and
            plants are determined by interconnected environmental
            variables that affect incidence, transmission, and outbreak.
            Climate change affects many of the environmental variables
            that lead to disease. Regardless of the species involved,
            the impacts can ultimately affect the health, livelihood,
            and economic security of humans. The objective of this World
            Bank economic and sector work is to build on scientific and
            operational knowledge of early action tools to help
            practitioners reduce the risks of key climate-sensitive
            infectious diseases by strengthening risk management systems
            for disease outbreaks. The report includes an assessment of
            known interventions such as the establishment of
            surveillance systems, the development of region and
            nation-specific disease outlooks, the creation of
            climate-sensitive disease risk maps, and the construction
            and implementation of early warning advisory systems. This
            research highlights the need for better understanding of the
            evolving interactions between the environment and emerging
            and reemerging disease pathogens. It also points to the
            inseparable interactions between animal health and human
            health, which climate change appears to be reinforcing and
            even diversifying. The assessment looks at investments that
            can lead to the development of these tools, working toward
            reducing global climate-sensitive disease risk. Because of
            the breadth of species affected by climate-sensitive
            disease, it has been helpful to select a model through which
            the specific impact of climate change and disease can be
            traced. In this instance, livestock has been chosen, given
            its significant global presence, economic importance, and
            susceptibility to disease outbreak. The livestock sector
            plays a vital role in the economies of many developing
            countries. Globally it accounts for 40 percent of
            agricultural gross domestic product (GDP).
