                                                         careful planning and adequate social work is needed to help both Roma families and non-Roma                                to national-level sectorwide strategies and policies. Vice versa, such an initiative could contribute to&#13;

                                                     For example, lack of water might be a major reason for bad health, but not necessarily an impediment for&#13;
                                                     employment. In such a case, you can tick water for health, but you do not need to tick water for employment.&#13;

                                                     At the end of the exercise, the diagnostic questionnaire will yield an inventory of community gaps and needs.&#13;
                                                     The questionnaire is designed to help the project planner identify common needs or impediments that affect&#13;
                                                     multiple aspects of the communityâ&#128;&#153;s living conditions (housing, employment, education, and health).&#13;
&#13;
                                                     Once the needs and impediments are identified, planners can use the Table of Potential Place-Based Intervention&#13;

                                                     community level. While the list is not exhaustive, it could help planners consider and prioritize interventions&#13;
                                                     to be included in future projects. A specific need can be fulfilled directly (such as by improving housing) or by&#13;
                                                     filling other needs that impede the direct fulfillment of the need (such as improving access to finance/creating&#13;
                                                     microcredit programs). It is very important to note that there are often various intervention options available&#13;
                                                     to solve the same need; depending on the communityâ&#128;&#153;s situation, some options are more feasible, effective, and&#13;

                                                     The prioritization of gaps/needs, impediments, and interventions need to be made to account for many&#13;
                                                     variables, such as their value and significance to the community members, feasibility, and cost-effectivenessâ&#128;&#148;&#13;

                                                     The impacts or results of a project should not dissipate with its completion or end of national and EU funding.&#13;
                                                     Often times, projects are designed without sufficient consideration of the operational arrangements and&#13;
                                                     recurrent (operation and maintenance) costs beyond the life of the project, and thus results cannot be sustained.&#13;
                                                     Projects need to be designed with a realistic exit strategy and activities that address the root causes of the&#13;
                                                     issues. Without an exit strategy, local communities will become dependent on the project (and financing), and&#13;
                                                     risk losing the gains achieved once the project ends. In addition, the design of any project must be accompanied&#13;

                                                     is provided free of charge, people may decide not to access it if the transactions or opportunity costs (e.g.,&#13;
                                                     transport, lost time for income generation and family care) are considered too high. Fear of being mistreated&#13;
                                                     by service providers or associated exposure to humiliation could also discourage them from accessing a service.&#13;

&#13;
                                                       Participatory evaluation is most effective when the project design and implementation have also been conducted&#13;
                                                       in a participatory manner. Participatory design implies that community members jointly decided the project&#13;
                                                       scope and activities and share the same vision regarding the projectâ&#128;&#153;s objectives and expected results. This&#13;
                                                       ensures that community members have been involved from the beginning in deciding the indicators on which&#13;
                                                       the project will be monitored and evaluated. Likewise, when it is time for the evaluation, community members&#13;
                                                       should be clear about why and how the evaluation will be conducted.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       Very few projects, however, follow a complete participatory process. While it is possible to conduct a participatory&#13;
                                                       evaluation even when project design and implementation have not followed a participatory process, this&#13;
                                                       requires more time and must be planned differently. The process starts with a discussion among participating&#13;
                                                       community and project staff about designing such an evaluation process. Participatory evaluation is the logical&#13;
                                                       culmination of a participatory process. Just as involving communities was critical for designing an appropriate&#13;

                                                       just involvement in terms of answering questions posed by outside evaluators, but involvement in designing the&#13;
                                                       evaluation, including what questions to ask, and of whom.&#13;

                                                             additional indicators are necessary to capture the complete picture.&#13;

                                      A specific need can be attributed to different causes or impediments, depending on the challenges faced by&#13;
                                      communities. For instance, Roma adults can find it difficult to get a job because they do not have the right&#13;

                                                                                                                                                                        is a good example of an intervention for improving and accessing rural infrastructure. The participatory approach&#13;

Objectives and Scope&#13;
The key objective of the ADRA Project is to improve Roma integration by providing affordable housing, in combination&#13;
with creating favorable conditions for Roma children to access education and experience healthy lifestyles to escape&#13;
a cycle of poverty and exclusion. To address the situation in Iztok, ADRA adopted an integrated approach consisting&#13;
of several activities, including:&#13;
     constructing a community medical center with a full-time general practitioner, a part-time visiting gynecologist,&#13;
     and a dentist;&#13;
     constructing houses (42 families have relocated to new homes);&#13;
     training sessions and apprenticeships in construction work;&#13;
     home economics training;&#13;
     employment skills training;&#13;
     life skills training with a specific focus on education for Roma mothers to support their children.&#13;

Objectives and Scope&#13;

The key objective of the â&#128;&#156;Housing Reward Ladderâ&#128;&#157; Project is to provide municipal social services and housing support&#13;
to low-income Roma. While the municipality has not been able to implement the full scheme, it has supported&#13;
the improvements of housing conditions of poor people by awarding small grants for upgrading apartments. The&#13;
larger (future proposed) component of the project envisions the refurbishment of a municipal-owned building in poor&#13;
condition that is currently inhabited by Roma. The building would become a place of temporary housing and support&#13;
to enable Roma to transition into permanent, stable housing and sustainable employment. The proposed project&#13;
included the following integrated services:&#13;
     small grants awarded for housing repairs;&#13;
     refurbishment of a municipal-owned social housing complex for transitional living;&#13;
     advice and support from social workers;&#13;
     vocational training and assistance in finding employment.&#13;

Context and Rationale                                                                                                                             their houses and public spaces renovated, while the segregated localities had only a few apartment blocks renovated.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                  Nevertheless, segregated neighborhoods were to receive educational and social services, unlike the non-segregated areas.&#13;

to 4,000 Roma living in PÅ&#153;erov. A large portion of them lives in a block of homes near the city center, while another on                          Another lesson learned is the importance of having the municipality maintain control over housing in the targeted&#13;
the outskirts of the city. The two main localities are Husova Street, with about 4,350 Roma, and KojetÃ­nskÃ¡ Street,                               intervention area throughout the project. Once the property is sold, especially to private owners, the municipality can no&#13;

escape indebtedness to other municipal-owned apartments in other parts of the city. All of the housing in the two                                 influence the tenancy structure (allowing low-income Roma to live there) and control over construction investments. The&#13;
segregated areas is in very poor condition. Public spaces around them are not suitable for leisure activities.7 Poverty                           new owners (non-Roma) were interested in grants available for renovation, so most of them applied and renovated their&#13;

meet these goals, the PÅ&#153;erov municipality applied an integrated approach of interconnected activities, which include:&#13;
                                                                                                                                                  investments. This made it difficult to synchronize the soft and hard activities, and the local plan became more of a wish&#13;

However, it should be noted that during the projectâ&#128;&#153;s implementation, the majority of&#13;

  and just 4.2 percent by the municipality or central state (according to the 2011 census). The latter figure is a significant drop from 2001,      9 Therewas also a proposal for a â&#128;&#156;People in Needâ&#128;&#157; subproject to address social exclusion among Roma residents by providing assistance with finding&#13;

Objectives and Scope&#13;
The key objectives of the Petit Lacanau Project were to reduce inequality and exclusion of Roma by providing social&#13;
housing for 30 Roma families (51 adults and 75 children) and to provide social support for Roma to access social and&#13;
economic services, in particular health and education. To meet these objectives, the Blanquefort municipality and&#13;
two NGO implementers applied an integrated approach to interconnect their activities, which included the following:&#13;
     construction of customized housing units with full utilities and services, and Roma relocation to this housing&#13;
     complex;&#13;
     registration of Roma in the public health system and healthcare and prevention information;&#13;
     education assistance for children and youth;&#13;
     professional skills training for youth and adults;&#13;
     establishing links between potential employers and Roma job seekers.&#13;

Objectives and Scope&#13;
The key objectives of the Hameau du Bouvray project are to support migrant Roma families in achieving adequate&#13;
levels of autonomy and economic self-sufficiency so they can become active social and economic participants in&#13;
French society within 3â&#128;&#147;5 years. To do so, the municipality and its NGO implementer have adopted an integrated&#13;
approach to interconnect their activities, which include:&#13;
     constructing housing units with full utilities and services (water, electricity, sewage);&#13;
     providing healthcare access, including counseling, healthy lifestyle advice, and pregnancy monitoring;&#13;
     legal support to obtain residency permits and to understand the French administrative system;&#13;

                            altogether five â&#128;&#156;roundsâ&#128;&#157; announced within this program. Each round was financed from        Self-Government local branches, even when there were other more locally embedded organizations, which had strong&#13;

                            education and more than half were unemployed. To be eligible, applicant neighborhoods&#13;
                            had to have a minimum population size of 45 people living in 10 dwellings or houses.&#13;
                            In addition to the segregated neighborhoods, the population of the whole municipality&#13;

plan to involve street social workers (supported by peers) to work on drugs/prostitution issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Design Features and Outcomes&#13;
Several key dimensions of the project in the Magdolna neighborhood made it successful. These elements are connected&#13;
to the sequencing of activities that created synergies between project activities, starting with: (i) the mobilization of&#13;
the target population at an early stage of project implementation, which created a strong sense of local ownership&#13;
and involvement; (ii) construction of the community center at an early stage of the project created a communal&#13;
meeting point, where an increasing number of soft interventions could take place in forthcoming project phases; (iii)&#13;
the selection of houses for refurbishment was done with contextual sensitivity to the state of living conditions in&#13;
the houses. In other words, those in worse condition were selected first. In the second round, houses in areas affected&#13;
by criminal activity, such as the drug trade and other social tensions, were refurbished. In the later rounds, the general&#13;
appearance of streets was taken into consideration when selecting new houses for refurbishment; (iv) investments&#13;
in public spaces, such as squares and parks, in combination with developing pedestrian walkways and general public&#13;
security awareness, further increased the sense of security among Magdolnaâ&#128;&#153;s residents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Good Practices and Lessons Learned&#13;
The Magdolna project applied innovative approaches and activities to urban rehabilitation. The idea to retain the majority&#13;
of the population in the regenerated area was novel; it had not been applied in any other inner city regeneration projects,&#13;
in which the ultimate goal was generally to gentrify the district/neighborhood.&#13;
&#13;
A major strength of the Magdolna Social Urban Rehabilitation Project has been the combination of an integrated&#13;
approach and long-term project approach. The inclusive strategy of involving residents in the project has been essential&#13;
to the projectâ&#128;&#153;s success, even if it created challenges due to delays of certain project elements. The neighborhood&#13;
development council, for example, has given local residents a key role in the decision-making process. The broad approach&#13;
of soft project elements, ranging from job trainings to child welfare programs and crime prevention trainings, involved&#13;
major parts of the neighborhood and thus created a strong sense of ownership. The sequencing of project activities and&#13;
the early construction of the community building later enabled activities to be organized within the community. This was&#13;
another important element of the projectâ&#128;&#153;s success. The organization running the project (RÃ&#137;V8 Ltd.) has gathered a&#13;
vast amount of experience over the years, and learned from many partners in the process. The involvement of district-&#13;
wide institutions, such as family help centers and social workers, has further strengthened the project.&#13;
&#13;
Another best practice was the way in which individual requests regarding housing were taken into consideration when&#13;
possible. Single and elderly persons could move to lower floors and families with children could move to larger apartments.&#13;
The majority of the tenants returned to their original but upgraded residences. Home upgrading was done in parallel&#13;
with an increase in rent levels. Nevertheless, the level of indebtedness of families participating in the program has&#13;
decreased slightly regardless of the increase in rental fees. Lastly, participatory input from neighborhood beneficiaries&#13;
in the provision of municipal public services has been another good practice. During the recently launched Phase 3, the&#13;
municipal transportation company has been involved in project activities, in which Magdolna residents give input on&#13;
redesigning the bus transportation route 99, which crosses the neighborhood and has a very bad reputation. The unique&#13;

The key objective of the GyÅ&#145;r-Ã&#154;jvÃ¡ros Urban Rehabilitation Project was to regenerate the neighborhood by renovating&#13;
apartment buildings and commercial premises, along with revitalizing and cleaning the nearby polluted park to&#13;
become a safe recreational space for children and adults. To address these multiple challenges, the municipality of&#13;
GyÅ&#145;r and its implementing partners applied an integrated approach, which included the following activities:&#13;
     renovation of 40 apartments to be rented to 120â&#128;&#147;130 socially disadvantaged tenants. The selected apartments&#13;
     need upgrading because of their dilapidated conditions and missing kitchen, bathroom, and toilet;&#13;
     refurbishment of 5 commercial premises for new shops, restaurants, and so on;&#13;

opposed to a non-Roma bodyâ&#128;&#148;newly headquartered in the neighborhood in the recently constructed community center.&#13;
The Roma Minority Self-Government safeguards the sustainability of the infrastructure works and overall project results.&#13;
Having the trust of Roma beneficiaries, it also took the lead in spearheading afterschool tutoring and recreational&#13;
activities for children (ages 10â&#128;&#147;16); and (vi) involvement of NGOs with existing expertise in soft activities, such as&#13;
the VadvirÃ¡g AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny nonprofit service provider, which has experience in early childhood development programs. The&#13;
nonprofit organized a Sure Start program in the target neighborhood to provide information to mothers about how to&#13;
care for infants and children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Good Practices and Lessons Learned&#13;
The KaposvÃ¡r Urban Rehabilitation Project showcases several good practices of an integrated approach and project&#13;
design. Firstly, it based its project design on a survey conducted in the neighborhood by an independent polling company&#13;
(SzocioNet). According to survey results, a large percentage of respondents (75 percent) expressed interest in participating&#13;
in the project, and 45 percent indicated interest in unpaid voluntary work. This suggested to project managers optimism&#13;
regarding the sustainability of expected results.&#13;
&#13;
While housing and infrastructure improvements are relatively quick and easily measurable, changing attitudes and&#13;
dispositions take longer. This is an important reason to integrate soft activities with an intercultural dimension into&#13;
the project. They are a first step towards reducing discrimination and creating openness between Roma and non-&#13;
Roma, helping each other to understand the otherâ&#128;&#153;s culture and traditions. These programs, located at the community&#13;
center, encourage the intermingling of Roma and non-Roma communities through food and celebrations. After these&#13;
occasions, Roma and non-Roma in the neighborhood already start to talk to each other more and show a genuine&#13;
interest toward different cultures. They even come back repeatedly for similar programs. These perceived changes are&#13;
at first experienced only on a microsocial level, but can over time lead to a decrease in segregation and discrimination.&#13;

                                          The city of Kazincbarcika (population 30,000) is home to almost 6,000 Roma. The predominantly Roma settlement&#13;
                                          of Herbolya lies just on the outskirts of town.11 Homes in Herbolya are old and in poor condition. Herbolya was&#13;
Project Brief 18                          originally a minersâ&#128;&#153; settlement with rudimentary living conditions. Over 80 percent of the 150 houses in Herbolya are&#13;
                                          without water and sanitation. Houses are heated with wood and fuel. They are prone to dampness and mold because&#13;

                                          Bosco (church-based) Vocational School. There is a bus connection to the city center, but transportation is expensive&#13;

                                          20â&#128;&#147;30 minute walk). According to a social worker in the Herbolya settlement, criminality, drug abuse, and prostitution&#13;
                                          are widespread. Almost half of the families depend on social benefits for their main source of income. Over a quarter&#13;
                                          of the population are children under the age of 14, while there are also many elderly retired persons.&#13;

â&#128;¢ new common washing facilities           major innovations of the project was that it brought intensive social work to the Roma settlement by establishing office&#13;
â&#128;¢ new community house and office of       space for a family help center at the heart of the Roma settlement instead of running the service in the city center&#13;
the nurse and the family help center      which could hardly be reached by the local community. A further innovative element was the creation of a public laundry&#13;
                                          and shower facility within the same center, which has greatly enhanced the quality of life for beneficiaries without&#13;

its own vocational training courses, so it could run employment-related and other soft interventions; and (iv) the project&#13;
avoided giving financial assistance directly to Roma families. Targeting Roma with large-scale funding is seldom&#13;
without conflict. In Herbolya, there was general acceptance of the problem, however, probably because there were no&#13;
individuals as direct (financial) beneficiaries. This prevented resentment and helped maintain cooperation throughout&#13;
the project period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Good Practices and Lessons Learned&#13;
The Herbolya Social Rehabilitation Project utilized the good practice of offering a wide diversity of soft elementsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
from trainings and tangible social services to events and clubs (10 percent of total project costs were spent on soft&#13;
interventions)â&#128;&#148;which ensured that there was something for everyone and Roma of all ages benefited from the program.&#13;
The level of access that Roma and vulnerable groups have to services and activities greatly improved over the course of&#13;
the project. This is valuable for beneficiaries, due to the distance of the Herbolya settlement from the city center, where&#13;
most services are offered. After the project closure, however, the accessibility of many services deteriorated again due&#13;
to a lack of funding.&#13;

Design Features and Outcomes&#13;
Key dimensions in implementing the integrated HuszÃ¡r-telep Social Rehabilitation Project are the way in which it:&#13;
(i) engaged NGOs with experience in implementing soft projects and/or working with Roma. The projectâ&#128;&#153;s social&#13;
components are based on the work of organizations that have been working in the area for a long time (for example,&#13;
Human-Net NGO has been running the family help center for ten years); (ii) targeted both potential victims and residents&#13;
with known criminal records in its crime prevention activities. This strategy works to break the cycle of crime and&#13;
violence in the neighborhood, as it restores public safety. It works to make the settlement a more attractive, safer place&#13;
to live and improves its reputation and those of its inhabitants; (iii) education and crime prevention programs are&#13;
creative and engaging, using everything from drama pedagogy to audiovisual materials, moderated discussions, and&#13;
pamphlets to raise awareness about drug abuse, prostitution, and human trafficking. Women are also targeted with&#13;
information about domestic violence. Special attention is given to issues of usury loans, mafia, and petty offenses (like&#13;
begging); and (iv) public events celebrated the Roma identity of HuszÃ¡r-telep, through theatre and holiday celebrations.&#13;
These celebrations help to empower Roma to be proud of their self-identity, as well as break down stereotypes about&#13;
Roma and the settlement in wider society. On the other hand, the municipality has made little effort to inform the Roma&#13;
community about the planned activities, or include the local residents in project-related planning and discussion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Good Practices and Lessons Learned&#13;
The HuszÃ¡r-telep Social Rehabilitation Project showcases how a project may benefit from the capacity of well embedded&#13;
NGOs, which have been working in HuszÃ¡r-telep for a long time. This enhances the projectâ&#128;&#153;s accessibility to the local&#13;
population and the beneficiaries most in need. It ultimately contributes to the sustainability of the project results over&#13;
time.&#13;

Objectives and Scope&#13;
The key objective of the Grazia Deledda Project is to provide migrant Roma families temporary housing as a&#13;
way to increase their autonomy and social and economic inclusion in Italy. Beneficiaries stay in Grazia Deledda&#13;
accommodations for a period of six months with the possibility to renew for another six months, during which time&#13;
Roma take part in mandatory social assistance project activities. The activities are meant to help Roma find work&#13;
and housing, so that after twelve months they can integrate into private market housing and social life. To accomplish&#13;
these goals, the municipality and its NGO implementers have adopted an integrated approach to interconnect their&#13;
activities, which include:&#13;
     constructing transitional (temporary) housing units out of former elementary school for rent-free 6+6 month stays;&#13;
     providing healthcare access and monitoring;&#13;
     providing education enrollment assistance;&#13;
     educational activities for children and adults, including on issues of legal entitlements, criminality, and violence&#13;
     prevention;&#13;
     employment skill-building;&#13;
     literacy programs for Roma and other minorities in the local community.&#13;

Areas of intervention:          living conditions in the Ursarie neighborhood are modest. Small houses are made of&#13;
Housing, vocational             hay and clay, and access to electricity and other utilities is limiting. Fifteen of the&#13;
training                        neighborhoodâ&#128;&#153;s 24 homes are at risk of collapsing or another safety hazard, while the&#13;

Objectives and Scope&#13;
The key objectives of the BÄ&#131;lÅ£eÅ&#159;ti â&#128;&#156;A House, A Futureâ&#128;&#157; Project were to improve the living conditions of 24 Roma families&#13;
and to provide vocational training for 15 adults to help their sustainable employment. To do so, the implementing&#13;
agencies integrated housing and employment activities, such as:&#13;
     constructing 24 brand new or renovated homes;&#13;
     assistance in obtaining affordable mortgages (through labor contributions and deductions);&#13;
     vocational training and apprenticeship programs in construction for 15 adults;&#13;
     facilitated access to water, sewage, electricity, and other municipal services.&#13;

Key dimensions of the BÄ&#131;lÅ£eÅ&#159;ti â&#128;&#156;A House, A Futureâ&#128;&#157; Project include: (i) beneficiary ownership over the project that&#13;
stemmed from beneficiaries participating in building their own homes. This was after receiving vocational training in&#13;
construction. Beneficiary labor contributions earned them deductions in their monthly mortgage payments for new&#13;
homes. For beneficiaries not involved in volunteer work, they could still pay an affordable mortgage for their home, although&#13;
they were expected to reimburse up to 50 percent of the building costs; (ii) municipal and community cooperation&#13;
with NGO implementers ensured support from local authorities for all project activities, from accessing paperwork for&#13;

Objectives and Scope&#13;
The key objective of the Brazil Housing Project was to improve the living conditions of ten families from the â&#128;&#156;Brazilâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
Roma community in NuÅ&#159;falÄ&#131;u village. The project was part of a larger program that included extending electricity&#13;
to the community, encouraging the production and sale of bricksâ&#128;&#148;a traditional occupation of this Roma groupâ&#128;&#148;as&#13;
well as civil society capacity building and education and health awareness activities. To accomplish these goals, the&#13;
SPOLU Foundation implementing the project adopted an integrated approach to interconnect housing and social&#13;
inclusion and empowerment activities, which included:&#13;
     construction of 10 new private homes for 10 Roma families;13&#13;
     interethnic trust-building and Roma empowerment exercises,&#13;
     job creation (100 new jobs) by resurrecting traditional Roma brick-making enterprise in the area;&#13;
     apprenticeship program matching job seekers to employers;&#13;
     vocational training and apprenticeship programs;&#13;
     afterschool education activities for children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   voluntary work, and assist other people (such as the elderly or disabled), as well as considerations such as a large family.&#13;

The key objective of the Institute for Relocation and Social Inclusionâ&#128;&#153;s (IRIS) Subsidized Rental Housing Project&#13;
in Madrid is to eradicate poverty and social exclusion among Roma, especially those living in illegal settlements,             Another key feature of the IRIS program is its â&#128;&#156;spatial integrationâ&#128;&#157; component. Families that are rehoused are distributed&#13;
through opportunities for rehousing, relocation, and social integration. In particular, the project aims to allocate rental    in neighborhoods all around the wider region of Madrid. This avoids the creation of slums and encourages Roma inclusion&#13;
housing to needy Roma families evenly across the city in order to discourage segregation. Meanwhile, social support is         in Madridâ&#128;&#153;s social and economic life. In these ways, the project explicitly seeks to overcome segregation in an ongoing&#13;
provided to Roma beneficiaries in order to adjust to their new homes, neighborhoods, and livelihoods. The assumption           manner.&#13;
is that normalized housing is a vehicle for social integration and growth. This is even if housing alone cannot ensure&#13;
social inclusion and poverty reduction, and so social services are integrated into the project. For its activities, IRIS has&#13;
traditionally worked with excluded Spanish Roma communities living in substandard housing, although lately IRIS is&#13;
increasingly working with Roma communities from Romania and Bulgaria. To address the social and material needs&#13;
of these communities, IRIS has adopted an integrated approach to interconnect activities:&#13;
	    provide residential public apartments with subsidized rent. Rent is approximately â&#130;¬64 to â&#130;¬198 per month,&#13;
     according to apartment size and location. IRIS buys the flats on the private market or from the municipal/&#13;
     regional social housing agency and rents them out at subsidized costs to marginalized families;&#13;

program within the region of Navarra. The project is based on the principle that a lack of proper housing and a&#13;
segregated life, with no or difficult access to social services, is one of the main impediments to overcoming poverty&#13;
and marginalization. To address these challenges, the project implementers utilized an integrated approach of hard&#13;
and soft activities:&#13;
     allocation of public and private housing units, including some with subsidized rent. The region of Navarra either&#13;
     allocates apartments it already owns or finds apartments on the private market to rent. The rental contracts&#13;
     are between the beneficiary and the region;&#13;

Objectives and Scope&#13;
The key objectives of the Segovia Relocation and Social Inclusion Project were to relocate families living in slums&#13;
to standard housing (public and private) and promote their socioeconomic inclusion in society. To do so, the project&#13;
implementers utilized an integrated approach that involved the following activities:&#13;
     relocation of 60 families (46 Spanish Roma) into private and social housing units with full utilities. The rental&#13;
     price is affordable (â&#130;¬35 to â&#130;¬150 per month according to apartment size and the beneficiaryâ&#128;&#153;s income);&#13;
     conflict management among clans and family members occasionally in conflict;&#13;
     educational advancement of children, including making a dedicated space in homes where children can study&#13;
     and do their homework;&#13;
     promotion of healthy lifestyles;&#13;
     job training workshops and job search assistance;&#13;
     enhancing the mobility and safety of women and children to move freely around town, as well as tackling drug&#13;
     trafficking and illegal activities.&#13;

&#13;
Objectives and Scope&#13;
The main objectives of the Kent County Coldharbour Site Project are to create appropriate accommodation and&#13;
support systems in the caravan site so that Romanichals and Travellers can flourish and prosper. The expected&#13;
outcome is tenure security for caravan dwellers in an authorized encampment that is connected to service provisions&#13;
and wider society. To achieve this, the project implementers utilized an integrated approach that involved the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
     refurbishing the site with 26 new pitches for caravans. Separate family pitches include a hard surface for parking&#13;
     the caravan, a fixed structure amenity, wooden fencing, drainage lines, a rubble drive area, and space for a garden.&#13;
     The entire site is enclosed for privacy from the nearby highway and police station;&#13;
     infrastructure upgrading and extension of the site;&#13;
     constructing pedestrian sidewalks to nearby shops and schools;&#13;
     building a large playground within visible distance from adult caregivers on the caravan pitches;&#13;
     educational support and promoting attendance among children from sites;&#13;
     empowering adults to educate wider society about Romanichals and Travellers, as well as to encourage their&#13;
     participation in their childrenâ&#128;&#153;s education. Together these activities help to generate awareness and acceptance&#13;
     of their culture;&#13;
&#13;

            Handbook for improving the living
            conditions of Roma
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A disproportionately large number of
            Roma1 in Europe today face deep poverty, social exclusion,
            and poor living conditions. Improving these is critical to
            achieving the targets of the Europe 2020 Strategy, the
            European Union’s 10-year growth strategy, which aims to
            reduce poverty, social exclusion, early school leaving, and
            increase school attainment and employment by 2020. The EU
            Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies (NRIS) up
            to 2020 calls on the European Commission and the member
            states to mobilize existing EU strategies and instruments in
            the cause of securing the socioeconomic inclusion of Roma
            and invites the member states to make sufficient use of EU
            and national funding to address Roma needs. The
            implementation and success of the NRIS will very much depend
            on an effective and sufficient allocation of national
            resources. EU funding alone can certainly not solve the
            situation of Roma, but the Commission calls on member states
            to make efficient use of the funds. The European Structural
            and Investment (ESI) Funds, principally the European Social
            Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),
            and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development
            (EAFRD) generally constitute the EU’s main instruments for
            supporting member states’ efforts to improve the lives of
            vulnerable people, including the Roma. These funds will be
            invested in shared management by the European Commission and
            the member states and regions through operational programs
            (OPs) that cover a seven year period between 2014 and 2020.
            Based on the priorities established in the OPs, the
            management authorities invest these funds for projects
            mainly on the basis of calls for proposals (CfPs). The
            Council of the European Union, through a recommendation on
            effective Roma integration measures, calls on the
            involvement of local authorities and civil society
            organizations (CSOs) in developing, implementing, and
            monitoring national strategies through operations
            co-financed by the ESI Funds. This handbook focuses on the
            four critical areas of Roma inclusion as identified by the
            EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies, which
            are access to (1) housing (including basic services); (2)
            employment; (3) education; and (4) health care. It argues
            that these four areas need to be addressed in an integrated
            way, rather than by a sector-by-sector silo approach, and
            for a number of reasons.
