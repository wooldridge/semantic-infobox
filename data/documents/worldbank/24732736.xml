ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is entered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ("ADB"), headquartered at 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong 11&#13;
1550, Metro Manila, Philippii es;&#13;
(2)   EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("EBRD"), headqu -t -ed&#13;

(5)   THE WORLD BANK GROU ', comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND [,EVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPI I i T&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), hea iquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, U   , ne&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylva i:&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, CC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("MIGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, D: 2r 433,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Groip")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties" or the "MDBs").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad internation I recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Intei i1: )nal&#13;
Organizations (1Os), the G7', and the private sector represented by the B20 that investir g ii the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging larkets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to Ex and&#13;
access to basic services an J raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic .1 wth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need present; a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on ex ting&#13;
sources of infrastructure fine nce-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coc,( ir ited&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize r rivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of rob ist pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects an It s is&#13;
understood to be the greates t barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investrr ei&#13;
(D) Governments, development 'inance institutions, donors, and private investors share an ir:E r: st in&#13;
developing the market for pivate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand t: 3, in&#13;
the numbers of structurally s und and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual err anc nce&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range c : late&#13;
investors that actively participate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals wil :l iefit&#13;
from collective action betwE en this range of entities-to leverage resources and know e:1; e to&#13;
find  solutions  to  complex  nfrastructure  financing  challenges  that no  single  instituticin  : iuld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) The Parties have, since their inception, and in accordance with their respective ins 1.J )nal&#13;
mandates, helped EMDE cl ent countries meet their infrastructure needs, both collecti' e ly and&#13;
individually. As such, the Pa ties have operational and technical knowledge in preparing iic i Jve,&#13;
sustainable infrastructure projects, creating an enabling environment for infra: t'L ture&#13;
investment, and leveraging both public and private sector resources to implement these :i (D icts.&#13;
This support is provided thr)ugh an extensive range of existing and proposed initiative , f. ids,&#13;
advisory services, and other forms of legal, institutional, and financial support (see Anne:  It is&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
recognized that an enhance i level of collaboration across these facilities and support a:1 ies,&#13;
particularly in the context oi complex projects with the potential to leverage substantia pr ate&#13;
capital, could be of benefit to Nards meeting their mutual goals.&#13;
(F) In support of these goals, thE Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure FE ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF") The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at leveral ii(: the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of i istitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruct ne vith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prep a  Ion,&#13;
structuring, and risk mitigati n for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard, he GIF&#13;
aims to complement existini and proposed services and initiatives currently supportec : the&#13;
Parties and other prospectivE GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prep, ri ,ell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure prcjects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces .i (; the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro F,, tive&#13;
private sector financiers into roject structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater I e age&#13;
of official resources in the face of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particLlar I:&gt; rge&#13;
and complex projects with th,. potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(G) The Parties are now interested in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure IE ility&#13;
Partnership Program, togethor with other partners.&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have com to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Faciliy Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended o be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set c.j il&#13;
Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Fo indational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the GIF Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their colla :cr. tion,&#13;
they are of an indicative nature and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties anc wi,il 1&#13;
other potential partners until he GIF is formally established. The final version of these objicti es&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend tc work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to fL rther enhance their coordination, in particular by developing l: IF,&#13;
with a view to formally establ shing the program by December 2014.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the 31F is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure p (jf :ts&#13;
in emerging markets and de\ eloping economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparat :i&#13;
provision of appropriate risk nitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commerciz I :1i&#13;
institutional investor engagernent in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex pub ic-private partnerships and projects with potential for comme -rE&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastrL c: e&#13;
financing solutions that no siigle institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF 3ims to create a global platform to provide financial and coon i ui ion&#13;
resources in collaboration wi h the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of tl-:3 v, de&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMD:&#13;
infrastructure, with the input ind ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engageme ii c uld&#13;
stretch from upstream suppo I on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to downstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risl,&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemef it.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structurEd&#13;
infrastructure projects, the G F can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset cla3s attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking lonc t: i&#13;
assets in faster growing ecor omies, but which until now have been presented only lirrited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profilE s&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to o )erate according to the following core principles, to be finalizE c )on&#13;
agreement among GIF partn,rs:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities tI : till&#13;
draw together ccmparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing put lic goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly thos&#13;
infrastructure prcjects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sust Ainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to tes&#13;
practice standards for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing tE Zh cal&#13;
and financial res &gt;urces of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mu :i a! )ral&#13;
development ins itutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in ar&#13;
innovative and fl.xible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greatE&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that arE&#13;
beyond the resources of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in t I(&#13;
development and implementotion of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF p  r ni rs&#13;
are expected to fall into one or more of the following categories:&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partners-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF w i1&#13;
considered Func ing Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partrers-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice and support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-fund( c&#13;
activities and/or )rovision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity supp :fl&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partnors-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial andiDr institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sovE reign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as w 1 3;&#13;
other multilatera or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure prc.jects, to be invited into discussions related to project preparE:i&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, witt a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial arid/or&#13;
institutional inve!;tment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Council is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmir g&#13;
management and use of funds, and development of operational policies and procedures;  ir&#13;
hold the GIF Management U it (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the factlity'&#13;
objectives and principles, wit i advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The compo i:i: i of&#13;
the Governing Council will bE agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is prop :i.E to&#13;
comprise representatives of :unding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Council comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Dir t.&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer o the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facili Etc&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve as&#13;
sounding board, providing gL idance and support for GIF Management, and in particular w I1&#13;
view to ensuring suitability oi projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be admiiistered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicate i :Em&#13;
established for this purpose (the GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will f in:: n&#13;
as a coordinating body as projects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mo\ e&#13;
toward technical support and financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead in  li i: Jal&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity impleme itation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partne&#13;
institutions, coordinated by tl e GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governme is&#13;
according to specific project equirements and the project origination processes. Compos :i:) of&#13;
the implementation teams m iy vary according to the need of individual projects and gove rml !nts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection ci iteria and processes could be developed to reflect the follo%i,i(&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Inipact-projects that support the development goals of the GI=&#13;
partner institutioi is;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-pro ects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities a3.&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-pr jects that require multiple parties to come together to provid!&#13;
structuring, arrar ging and financial support, and/or projects which require a bl :. lo of&#13;
financial instrum )nts; and&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial iE ility,&#13;
leverage public funds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- L h&#13;
as through Publi -Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's se vice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastr icture investments that have global public good characteristi :5 uch&#13;
as climate friendly-project 3 that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisiol I&#13;
infrastructure services; and t *ade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconnE:. i\ -y&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of suppcrt provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, witl- Z ew&#13;
to complementing the resour.,es and support already available from partner entities and o h:.&#13;
funding mechanisms. During the GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following a&lt; tw es,&#13;
corresponding to major proje:t development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; prciect definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility sci s:  ng;&#13;
and legal, regulatory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii)  Project preparati:)n and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and P 1P structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, anc design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrangig and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financ n.&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies- ncluding in particular the management of environmental and s al&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastr .ilt. -e&#13;
projects in supporting sustair able, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supportec operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements *r&#13;
external implementing entities under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards an :l er&#13;
standards and policies, and &lt; evelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for G 1:&#13;
Technical Partners who are (xpected to function as implementing entities for GIF activitie,&#13;
