            lessons from Argentina, Chile, Malaysia, and Singapore
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In most countries, participation in a
            public pension system involving some kind of redistribution
            is compulsory, while participation in private pension
            schemes is voluntary.  There are growing fears in many
            countries that the value of public pensions will not be
            sustained.  There are similar fears about company pensions.
            The credibility of company pensions depends on the integrity
            and solvency of large employers, which can no longer be
            taken for granted.  These problems point to a need to refine
            compulsory saving.  Drawing on the experiences of countries
            in Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere, this Note provides
            some guidance on answering the following questions: 1) Whom
            to compel?  2) Defined contribution or benefit?  3) How
            large should compulsory contributions be?  4) Who should
            manage the funds?  5) What types of regulation are
            appropriate?  6) What state guarantees for what system?  7)
            How to offer tax incentives?
