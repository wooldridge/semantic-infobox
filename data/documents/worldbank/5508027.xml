Nearly 60 per cent of Filipinos now live in&#13;
urban areas, mostly in small towns with less&#13;
than 100,000 people. A number of Philippine&#13;
small towns have access to piped water&#13;
supply services, either connected to household&#13;
taps or via a series of public standpipes.&#13;

Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Small towns water supply is a neglected                         populations between 5,000 and 50,000&#13;
`market' globally, and the Philippines is no                       inhabitants, but can be larger or smaller"&#13;
exception. The key issue is that water supply&#13;
systems in small towns are typically too complex                   In the Philippines today, nearly 60% of the&#13;
to be well managed by community groups, but                    population live in urban areas, up from 40%&#13;
too small to be financially viable for professional            only twenty years ago. Manila is a huge city,&#13;
water utilities. Furthermore, most water supply                even in global terms, but much of this high and&#13;
funding and assistance goes to definitively rural              rising urban population is now found in smaller&#13;
or urban cases, leaving small towns dependent                  towns. According to the 2000 Census, there are&#13;
on meager local government budgets.                            1,600 cities and towns in the Philippines1, and&#13;
                                                               95% of these have populations below 100,000.&#13;
   There is some debate over what defines a&#13;
`small' town, as there are marked differences                      These figures illustrate the growing&#13;
&#13;
in the pattern of urban development from                       significance of the small towns sub-sector in the&#13;
&#13;
country to country, and region to region. In                   Philippines. When considered in tandem with&#13;
&#13;

                                                               water supply and sanitation sector. Yet, little is&#13;
&#13;
   "Small towns are settlements that are                       known about the performance or relative&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
   to expand services to meet the growing                      which used case studies of fourteen small town&#13;

MANAGEMENT MODELS FOR SMALL TOWNS WATER SUPPLY                                                                1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    examine `factors of success' for different&#13;
management models. The key lesson from the&#13;
case studies was that water supply systems using&#13;
community-based management models (e.g.&#13;
Water Cooperatives and RWSAs1) are the most&#13;
consistently successful2 in small towns. Water&#13;
Cooperatives and RWSAs are locally-&#13;
embedded institutions that prosper in the&#13;
highly politicized small towns of the Philippines,&#13;
while strong community involvement preserves&#13;
their autonomy (political and financial) and&#13;
ensures transparency and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The     successful     community-based&#13;
management bodies are more sophisticated&#13;
than typical community management models.&#13;
A key factor is the professional support they&#13;
receive, which allows them to provide cost-&#13;
efficient and well-planned services, while&#13;
retaining their local advantages and demand-&#13;
responsiveness. Nearby Water Districts3, which&#13;
manage their own large urban water supply&#13;
systems, provide a ready source of technical&#13;
assistance, and have enabled community-based&#13;
management bodies to introduce commercial&#13;
accounting systems, domestic water meters, and&#13;
well-organized billing and collection systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    As small towns grow and their water supply&#13;
systems become more complex, professional&#13;
water utility management skills become more&#13;
important. For this reason, it has been argued&#13;
that community-based management models are&#13;
not suitable for small towns water supply.&#13;
However, the lessons learned from this study&#13;
suggest that professional support helps&#13;
community-based management bodies to&#13;
evolve with their systems, and allows an&#13;
incremental transition from community-based&#13;
to commercial water supply management.&#13;
Encouragement and assistance in contracting&#13;
out commercially viable functions (e.g.&#13;
operation and maintenance, billing and&#13;
collection, and financial audits) would assist        1 Rural Water Supply Associations (RWSAs)&#13;
community-based management bodies to                  2"Successful performance" is defined as water supply&#13;

&#13;
    WPEP is an action research project in the Philippines, which is jointly funded by AusAID (the Australian&#13;
Government's aid program), the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank and the Government&#13;
of the Philippines (GOP). The executing agency for the GOP is the Water Supply and Sanitation Program&#13;
Management Office of the Department of Interior and Local Government (WSSPMO-DILG), with support&#13;
from the Water and Sanitation Program ­ East Asia &amp; Pacific (WSP-EAP). The goal of the project is "to&#13;
enhance the access of the under-served rural and urban poor to adequate water and sanitation services&#13;
on a sustainable basis."&#13;
&#13;
    The WPEP action research agenda is demand driven through consultation with a broad range of&#13;
water supply and sanitation sector practitioners in the Philippines. At the outset, WPEP funded six&#13;
background studies, which provided the basis for the learning agenda. Following consultation on&#13;
these studies, WPEP commissioned local consultants to undertake four field-based studies on the following&#13;
topics:&#13;
&#13;
     ·    Small Towns Water and Supply Management Models (STWSMM);&#13;
     ·    Urban Sewerage and Sanitation: What has worked and what has not (USS);&#13;
     ·    Small Scale Independent Providers (SSIP);&#13;
     ·    Rural Water: Models for Sustainable Development and Sector Financing (RWSFin)&#13;

The Philippine small towns are unusually dynamic in nature ­ population grows rapidly and economic activities are&#13;
ever increasing. Water supply systems in small towns need to be able to cope with this changing environment.&#13;

&#13;
     The towns of Surigao del Norte Province (Mindanao) are typical of the LGU management model:&#13;
the Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator (MPDC) handles operations; the Municipal&#13;
Engineer's Office (MEO) manage construction &amp; repairs; and the Municipal Treasurer's Office assists&#13;
with billing &amp; collection. Some towns hire meter readers, plumbers and laborers on a regular basis,&#13;
while other towns hire personnel only when needed, or when they have funds.&#13;
&#13;
     Hinigaran Water System (Negros Occidental, Visayas) is owned and managed by the municipality,&#13;
but was formerly a Water District. The water system was returned to the LGU because the system was&#13;
not successful (its water source was too distant). The LGU has since programmed P3.5 million (US$&#13;
70,000) for expansion and rehabilitation of the system, and the Provincial Government is assisting with&#13;
development by paying for new distribution pipes. The barangay is assisting by providing labor. The&#13;
system is operated by the Mayor through a City Public Utility Officer, assisted by 12 staff and an Internal&#13;
Auditor.&#13;

                               Typical Water District Management&#13;
&#13;
    The General Manager of a Water District is appointed by the Board, and is given full control of&#13;
operations, including the authority to appoint all Water District personnel. The General Manager&#13;
of Subic Water District (Zambales Province, Luzon) has been in position for its entire 22-year life,&#13;
as has one of the female directors. Water District Boards comprise five directors, who serve six-&#13;
year terms with staggered starts. This ensures the capability to implement long-range policies,&#13;
and prevents the LGU leader (usually a Mayor or Governor) from appointing more than 2- 3&#13;
directors during their three-year term.&#13;
&#13;
    Water Districts have common procedures and commercial systems for billing &amp; collection of&#13;
tariffs, accounts, budgeting, preparation of financial statement, tariff setting, and all house&#13;
connections have water meters. Water District tariffs must cover O&amp;M costs, debt servicing&#13;
requirements, and an additional allowance for capital expenditures and reserves. Tariffs are set&#13;
following public hearings, approval by the Board, and LWUA review and confirmation.&#13;

                                      LWUA Loans to Water Districts&#13;
&#13;
     The Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) provides loans to Water Districts for `financially&#13;
viable' projects. LWUA is able to secure loans at concessionary rates (3-4%), which it then offers&#13;
to Water Districts at higher interest rates (8-12.5%). In addition, LWUA charges 9% of the gross&#13;
loan amount for carrying out feasibility and detailed design studies, plus another 4% for construction&#13;
supervision. LWUA also passes on any currency adjustments due to fluctuation of the dollar-peso&#13;
rate.&#13;
&#13;
     LWUA used to be allowed to extend assistance to Water Districts that were not commercially&#13;
viable by supplying 50% of the funds required as a grant. However, this practice was stopped in&#13;
1998, when the National Economic &amp; Development Authority (NEDA) ordered that LWUA support&#13;
only projects deemed financially viable (i.e. able to recover all costs and pay back their loans).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     Adapted from Lazaro, 2000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    LWUA was the main source of capital for                             LWUA's `financial viability' requirement&#13;
Water Districts (see Box on LWUA loans), but its                   was meant to improve cost recovery. In&#13;
funding has dried up and it is being reformed.                     practice, this approach has made it hard for&#13;
LWUA loans have proved expensive, and the                          Water Districts to provide services to the&#13;
condition that all financing costs are passed on                   poor. Water Districts, especially those with&#13;
to water users appears to have reduced                             substantial debt and already high tariffs,&#13;
incentives for efficient design or for cost-effective              tend to confine their service coverage to the&#13;
implementation. When loans are badly spent,                        wealthier `urban barangays'1. More&#13;
Water Districts are still forced to raise their tariffs,           borrowing would be needed to fund&#13;
leading to a vicious circle: inadequate services                   expansion beyond this service area, and&#13;
and high tariffs result in lower consumption,                      Water Districts fear that low-income&#13;
which reduces revenues, making cost recovery&#13;
difficult and, in many cases, requiring further                    households will not be able to afford (or be&#13;

tariff increases (see Box on high tariffs).                        willing to pay) their high tariffs.&#13;

&#13;
       In 1987, Numancia Water District (Visayas) received approval for a LWUA loan to improve&#13;
  services. The water users were highly supportive of the project, and agreed to an initial tariff of&#13;
  P3.5/m3, rising to P5/m3 following project completion in 1993. Debt repayments required further&#13;
  tariff increases, and by 1997 the tariff had nearly doubled to P9/m3.&#13;
&#13;
       Unfortunately, Numancia Water District was unable to service its debt repayments, and in&#13;
  1998 LWUA took over management of the water supply. Another public hearing was held to&#13;
  discuss further tariff hikes to raise funds for the payment of arrears and to enable the development&#13;
  of additional water sources. An immediate 36% tariff increase was approved, as were later&#13;
  increases of 20% in 2000 and 12% in early 2002. The tariff stood at P18/m3 by the end of 2001,&#13;
  but the management decided to defer the planned Jan 2002 increase (to P20/m3 = US$ 0.40/&#13;
  m3) because this was likely to lead to more disconnections, thus further diminishing their revenue&#13;
  and cash flow1.&#13;

in which women actively participate. The basic tariff is P6/m3 (US$0.12/m3) and collection efficiency is&#13;
70-80%. The water users know each other and feel a sense of ownership for the system, which helps&#13;
get bills paid and makes disconnections rare. External financing is needed for major works as 88% of&#13;
the revenue is spent on routine operation and maintenance. Private contractors are hired when repairs&#13;
are needed, and spare parts and equipment are readily available.&#13;

&#13;
    Guimbal is a small town in Iloilo Province with a population of 27,700. Guimbal RWSA has&#13;
 been operating for 15 years and now supplies water to one third of the urban barangays. It&#13;
 has a very progressive LGU, which assisted the RWSA in attracting professional support from a&#13;
 local Water District, and in sourcing grant funding for construction of its water supply facilities.&#13;
&#13;
    The water supply system has only average operational efficiency (7 staff for 714 house&#13;
 connections), but is well managed and the RWSA makes a reasonable profit (15% profit&#13;
 margin in 2000). In 2001, the RWSA took the unusual step of reducing the minimum&#13;
 tariff from P70 to P60 (for 10m3). Interestingly, this 17% tariff reduction led to a 50%&#13;
 increase in annual water consumption, creating higher overall revenues and enabling&#13;
 the RWSA to maintain a profit margin of 12%. Guimbal RWSA is fortunate to have a&#13;
 water supply system capable of meeting this increased demand, but it is making the most&#13;
 of its assets, and the water users are clearly benefiting from the RWSA's cost-efficient&#13;
 management.&#13;

B Incentives to provide professional              management is vital for the sustainability of small&#13;
   support                                        town water supply systems under community-&#13;
                                                  based or local government management,&#13;
    The successful case studies were often        particularly in those towns where population is&#13;
dependent on professional support from a          growing rapidly. This transition will allow the&#13;
Water District. This support cannot be            advantages of locally embedded management&#13;
guaranteed. Suitable Water Districts are not      to be gradually enhanced by the introduction of&#13;
available in all areas, and some may not wish     more efficient operational, financial and&#13;
&#13;
to offer their services. Therefore, it is         decision-making processes. Professional support&#13;
                                                  will be important, but these management bodies&#13;
recommended that institutions capable of          should also look to contract out commercially&#13;
providing professional support (be they Water     viable functions (e.g. O&amp;M, billing and&#13;
Districts, or other independent providers) should collection, auditing) to local enterprises, thus&#13;
be offered incentives to assist managers of small improving efficiency while retaining overall&#13;
towns water supply systems.                       ownership and control of their systems.&#13;

            Small towns water supply is a neglected
            market globally, and the Philippines is no exception. The
            key issue is that water supply systems in small towns are
            typically too complex to be well managed by community
            groups, but too small to be financially viable for
            professional water utilities. Furthermore, most water supply
            funding and assistance goes to definitively rural or urban
            cases, leaving small towns dependent on meager local
            government budgets. In the Philippines today, nearly 60
            percent of the population live in urban areas, up from 40
            percent only twenty years ago. Manila is a huge city, even
            in global terms, but much of this high and rising urban
            population is now found in smaller towns. According to the
            2000 Census, there are 1,600 cities and towns in the
            Philippines1, and 95 percent of these have populations below 100,000.
