            The World Bank annual report 2008 : year in review
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The World Bank Group's work focuses
            on achievement of the eight Millennium Development Goals
            (MDGs). The goals call for eliminating poverty and achieving
            inclusive and sustainable globalization. The MDGs lay out a
            blueprint for the World Bank Group, setting its priorities
            and measuring its results. The World Bank is the
            world's largest funder of education; the world's
            largest external funder of the fight against HIV/AIDS; a
            leader in the fight against corruption worldwide; a strong
            supporter of debt relief; and the largest international
            financier of biodiversity, water supply, and sanitation
            projects. The recipients of the World Bank Group's
            fiscal 2008 financial commitments are using the funds in
            more than 670 projects, many of them collaborative efforts
            of two or more of the affiliates. The projects are designed
            to overcome poverty and enhance growth by improving
            education and health services, promoting private sector
            development, building infrastructure, and strengthening
            governance and institutions. They are practical plans to
            help developing countries move from poverty and become more
            competitive in a globalizing world. The Bank Group is also
            preparing a strategic framework on climate change and
            development - a plan for integrating climate change and
            development challenges without compromising growth and
            poverty reduction efforts. The framework will include
            priorities, approaches, and a road map for action in helping
            countries mitigate or adapt to climate change. In addition,
            the Bank Group has set a goal of scaling up its portfolio of
            investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency
            projects by an annual average of 20 percent through 2010.
