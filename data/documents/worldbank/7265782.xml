&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
    1. Relations betweenthe federal government, the regions, andlocal governments have&#13;
       presented one o f the greatest challenges for the economic and political transformation o f&#13;
       Russia. Beginningwith the extreme centralization o f the Soviet period, Russianregions&#13;
       andrepublics' became increasingly independent andassertive inthe 1980s, thereby&#13;
       filling the vacuum left by decliningcentralpower. Economicallyrich or ethnically non-&#13;
       Russian regions oftenbecame particularly independent and, insome cases, openly&#13;
       defiant o f the central government.&#13;
&#13;
    2. Two legislative acts passed in2003 havehad a significant impact on the country's&#13;
       administrative andpolitical structure as a Federation. The first i s a Law that introduced&#13;
       revisions to the existingFederalLaw on the General Principles o f Organization o f&#13;
       Legislative and Executive Organs o f Power o f the Subjects o f the Federation, entered into&#13;
       effect on January 1,2005. The second is a Law on the Organization of Local Self-&#13;
       governance that entered into effect on January 1,2006 (transitional arrangements have&#13;
       been effective since the Law was promulgated inOctober 2003). This Law has&#13;
       introduced a fundamentally new blueprint for the country's administrative structure on the&#13;
       local level, with corresponding implications for higher levels o f government.&#13;
&#13;
    3. Overall, the approach to the organization o f local government that is set out inthe Law&#13;
       clarifies intergovernmentalrelations butreduces flexibility for local arrangements. The&#13;
       new Law clarifies the structures withinthe region, and makes it somewhat easier for the&#13;
       federal center to propose legislation related to local government as a whole. Intheory, this&#13;
       should help to rationalize expenditure assignments andrevenue allocations. Inpractice,&#13;
       however, it remains to be seenwhether the application o f a similar structure across vastly&#13;
       different regions interms o f size, wealth, and ability to deliver services will be&#13;
       implemented effectively. Certainly, the impositiono f a local government structure from&#13;
       the center reduces the federal nature o f the system inwhich regions could determine the&#13;
       system that would work best for them.&#13;
&#13;
    4. The laws embodied inthe recent reforms also specify the responsibilities o feach levelo f&#13;
       government, includingthe new tiers inlocal government. A few items are particularly&#13;
       noteworthy. Under the newlaws, determination o fpublic wages is the responsibility o f&#13;
       each level o f government, as opposed to being determinedby the central government.&#13;
       This allows localities some discretion incontrollingtheir wage bill. Subsidies to&#13;
       agriculture are now provided at the regional level, whereas subsidies to other non-state-&#13;
       owned enterprises are determined andprovidedby the central government. A very&#13;
       important change, one that is key to reducing unfUnded mandates, is that regions are now&#13;
       responsible for determining andfundingmany social policies, including child allowances,&#13;
       and support to the disabled, low-income families, orphans, andthe like.&#13;
&#13;
    5. The Republic o f Tatarstan, one o f Russia's 89 subjects o f the Federation and one o f the&#13;
       most autonomous regions, has entered the final stage o f a longprocess o f normalization&#13;
       o f its relationship with the federal center. In1994, the Republic of Tatarstan andthe&#13;
       federal government signed a Power-Sharing Treaty that formalized special tax and&#13;
       budgetaryconditions inTatarstan relative to other regions. This treaty was renewed for a&#13;
       five-year period in 1999, although the special status o f Tatarstan was diminished. The&#13;
&#13;
'The Russian Federation consists of 89 subjects o f the Federation. These are variously termed regions,&#13;
autonomous regions and republics.&#13;
                                                    - 3 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         treaty i s now beingphased out altogether inkeepingwith President Putin's policy o f&#13;
         standardizationo f federal-regional relations. In2000, the Russian government&#13;
         established the Federal Targeted Program, "Socio-economic Development of the&#13;
         Republic o f Tatarstan to 2006":      The program's aim was to assist the Republic inits&#13;
         transition to "normality," andto partlycompensate for losses inrevenues associated with&#13;
         the changeinfederal-regionalrelations.&#13;
&#13;
    6. As part ofthese changes inthe Republic o fTatarstan, the city o f Kazanacquiredthe legal&#13;
         status of a municipality inSeptember 2004 andfaced several challenge^.^ Like all other&#13;
         Russianmunicipalities, Kazanfaced a systemic risko f limited control over revenue&#13;
         sources andoverdependence on intergovernmental transfers. Secondly, the city was&#13;
         extremely dependent on the decisions o f federal andTatarstan authorities with respect to&#13;
         capital expenditures. In2005, Tatarstan andKazan graduated fromthe programandsuch&#13;
         transfers ceasedto exist. Pressing capital needs, such as repair o f educational institutions,&#13;
         social protectionfacilities, health care institutions, andsocial housing could not be met&#13;
         without additional financing.&#13;
&#13;
    7. Withthese changes inthe decentralization framework and inline with its new status&#13;
         withinthe Republic ofTatarstan, the city has undertakenreforms inseveral keyareas: (i)&#13;
         improvements inmunicipal financial management through better financial planning,&#13;
         treasury control, gradualphasing out o f overdue payables, better public procurement&#13;
         practices, andbetter management o fmunicipal assets; (ii)          improvedtargeting o f social&#13;
         protection through the monetization o f in-kindbenefits and concentration o f subsidieson&#13;
         vulnerable groups; and (iii)   improvements inhousingandutilities management through&#13;
         the eliminationo fbudget subsidies to enterprises indistrict heatingandthe privatization&#13;
         o f housing maintenance services.&#13;
&#13;
    8. To aid this reform effort, the RussianFederationrequested a USD125 millionKazan&#13;
         Municipal Development Loan (KMDL)to enable it to provide support to the&#13;
         municipality's reform effort. These funds were to enable an efficient financial and&#13;
         economic transition to the city's status as a full-fledgedmunicipality of the Republic o f&#13;
         Tatarstan. The loanwas made to the RussianFederationandthenpassed on as a grant to&#13;
         Kazan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I. RecentEconomicDevelopments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    9. Russia finds itselfinan excellent macroeconomic positioninthe second half of 2006.&#13;
         Highworldprices for hydrocarbonexports andstrongexpansionininternal demand&#13;
         continue to drive economic growth inRussia. Although a slowdowninmost&#13;
         manufacturing andtradable sectors became visible in2005, the second quarter o f 2006&#13;
         was markedby a strong acceleration o f GDP growth that reached 6.5 percent inthe first&#13;
         halfo f the year. 2006 also witnessed a substantial increase indomestic andforeign direct&#13;
         investment, which reflectedRussia's positive economic outlook and some improvements&#13;
         inthe business climate. FDIinflows grew by55 percent duringthe first three quarters of&#13;
         the year, reaching anestimated USD 10.3 billion. With the federal government runninga&#13;
         substantial budget surplus (about 8.7 percent o fGDP), official Russian external debt was&#13;
         reduced from USD 106 billion in2004 to below USD 50 billion bythe end o fthird&#13;
         quarter o f 2006. Gross foreign reserves continued to set records reaching USD 272.5&#13;
         billionby the end o f October 2006. The Stabilization Fundhas accumulatedover 2&#13;
         trillion rubles (USD 77 billion) by the end o f October this year andcould accumulate&#13;
         another USD 10-15 billionby the end o f the year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
* FederalTargeted Programs in Russia are a planning tool used to identify priorities for the federal budget&#13;
over a multi-year period that by design stipulate the identification o f other sources o f financing, e.g.&#13;
regional and local budgets and private investors.&#13;
  Previously, Kazan was an administrative division o f the Republic of Tatarstan.&#13;
                                                     - 4 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10. However, the medium andlong-termprospects for sustainingtoday's growthrates remain&#13;
    heavilydependentonvolatile naturalresources prices. Russia's growthperformance in&#13;
    particular benefited from highprices for hydrocarbon exports. The average exportprice&#13;
    o f Russia's oil inthe first sevenmonths o f 2006 was 56 USD/bbl compared to 45.2&#13;
    USDhbl in2005 and34.1 USD/bbl in2004. Overall, the economy's assets remain&#13;
    concentrated inthe extractive industries, with exports almost entirely dependent on&#13;
    naturalresources. Sector distributiono f investment flows also raises some concerns.&#13;
    While absolute investment levels remain low inRussiarelative to emerging markets (18&#13;
    percent o f GDP in2005 inRussia and25 percent andhigher incountries that have&#13;
    sustained rapidgrowth), investment remains concentrated inoil and gas, most&#13;
    manufacturing sectors o f the economy receive rather low shares o f investment and FDI.&#13;
    To ensure sustainable improvements, the government focusedonthe implementation of&#13;
    four Nationalprojects - inhealth, education, housing and agriculture - directly targeting&#13;
    the standardo f living o f the populationby combining higher spendinginthese areas with&#13;
    certain structural reforms.&#13;
&#13;
11. Industrialgrowth: Though industrialgrowthinRussiacontractedto 4 percent in2005,&#13;
    down from 8.3 percent in2004, it has slightly increased to 4.3 percent duringthe first ten&#13;
    months of2006, beingaccompaniedby a substantial increase indomestic investment.&#13;
    Aggregate fixed capital investment continued its strong double digit growth- at 12.6&#13;
    percent inJanuary-October 2006 (compared to 10.5 percent in2005). Butthe structural&#13;
    composition o f growthhas undergone some significant changes. Ifthe growth in2003-&#13;
    2004 was ledby oil and some other industrial sectors, subsequent growthhas shifted to&#13;
    the productiono f (largely) non-tradable services andgoods for the domestic market.&#13;
    Almost 50 percent of the GDP expansion in2005 came from trade andconstruction. In&#13;
    spite o f relatively low growth inmanufacturing (4.7 percent inten months o f 2006) there&#13;
    havebeen some positive trends observed since 2005. Several industries which produce&#13;
    tradable goods reported observable increases intheir productionduring2006. The&#13;
    biggestincrease inreal output was reportedby lightindustries,where textile andsewing&#13;
    grew 7.8 percent andproduction o f shoes andleather products increased by 13.2 percent.&#13;
    Both industries hadbeenreportingnegative growthrates for the last several years. The&#13;
    negative trend, however, continued inmachinebuildingandproductiono f electro-&#13;
    technical equipment. The productiono f electro-technical equipment has fallen by 1.5&#13;
    percent inJanuary-October 2006, while the productiono f machines andequipment&#13;
    increased by only 0.5 percent.&#13;
&#13;
12. Inflation and ExchangeRate: Concerns over inflationhave brought an important change&#13;
    inmonetarypolicy. While the CentralBankdefended arelativelystable exchange rate of&#13;
    the ruble versus the dollar duringmost o f 2005, it has allowed a 6.4 percent nominal&#13;
    appreciationinthe first halfo f 2006. Moreover, inearly 2006 the government launched&#13;
    preparation o f apackage on anti-inflationary measures inthe context o fproposals that&#13;
    include price controls, restrictingwage growthinthe state-owned companies, restricting&#13;
    borrowing by state-owned companies, andreducing state expenditures. The CPI inflation&#13;
    in2006 appearedtobeat amoderatelevel at 7.5 percentfor January-October, compared&#13;
                                                 -&#13;
    to 9.2 percent for the same period o f 2005.&#13;
&#13;
13. Termsof Trade: International trade in2006 was characterized by a considerable&#13;
    continued growth o f exports and imports. Export o f goods reached USD224.1billion in&#13;
    January-September 2006 (compared to USD 174.6 billion inthe corresponding period o f&#13;
    2005), andimports reachedUSD 112.7 billion (compared to USD 87.5 billion in2005).&#13;
    The record increases and current account surpluses owe almost entirely to price increases&#13;
    on Russianexports, most particularly for oil and gas. Russia's trade surplus reachedUSD&#13;
    111.5 billioninJanuary-September 2006, as comparedto USD 87.4 billioninthe same&#13;
   periodo f 2005. While export growth was drivenby exceptionally highprices for&#13;
    Russia's main export commodities, import growth resulted fiom the continuing&#13;
    appreciation o fthe ruble, combinedwith a rapid increase inreal incomes andpurchasing&#13;
   power.&#13;
&#13;
                                            - 5 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14. FederalBudget: According to the Ministryo f Finance estimates for the first nine months&#13;
    o f 2006, the Federal Budget was executed with a surplus o f 1685.5 billionrubles, or 8.7&#13;
    percent o f GDP on a cashbasis. Federalbudgetary revenues amountedto 4557 billion&#13;
    rubles or 23.5 percent o f GDP, which is by 0.6 percent lower thar'linthe first nine months&#13;
    o f 2005. This decline, however, is mostly explained by additional tax revenues that the&#13;
    federal budgetreceived from Yukos at the beginning o f 2005. Ifthe repayment o ftax debt&#13;
    byYukos is excluded, total revenues in2006 exceed the corresponding revenue levelin&#13;
    2005 by about 1percent o f GDP. The main factor for increased revenues has beenhigher&#13;
    energy prices which helped to increase non-tax revenues, while tax revenues registereda&#13;
    sizable decline due to mostly reduction inVAT collection. The Federal government&#13;
    expenditures were reported at only 14.8 percent o f GDP for the first nine months o f 2006&#13;
    (2871.5 billion rubles), considerably lower than 16.5 percent inthe same periodo f 2005.&#13;
    The amendment to the FederalBudget for 2006, approvedby the government at the&#13;
    beginningo fNovember, envisages anincrease inspendingby 161billionrubles (0.6&#13;
    percent o f GDP), while revenues are plannedto increase by 1.1trillion rubles (4.2 percent&#13;
    o f GDP).&#13;
&#13;
15. Income, Poverty andLabor Market Indicators: News on the standardo f living inRussia&#13;
    i s still encouraging. Average real wages and incomes continuedto exhibit strong growth&#13;
    in2006, registeringat 13.2 and 11.5 percentrespectively duringthe first tenmonthsof&#13;
    the year. Given the strong appreciation o f the ruble, dollar wages grew muchmore&#13;
    rapidly thanreal wages in2006 andaveraged USD 381 a month, a 30.5 percent increase&#13;
    over 2005.     Unemploymentrates also continued to fall, averaging 7.5 percent for the&#13;
    first ten months o f 2006, as comparedto 7.6 and 8.2 percent in2005 and 2004,&#13;
    respectively. Demographic statistics for 2004 indicate that the disturbingrise inmortality&#13;
    rates may have finally bottomed out. Life expectancy increasedfrom 64.3 to 65.8 years.&#13;
    Although official data on poverty are not yet available for 2005 and2006, indirect&#13;
    indicators suggest that growth inRussia remains strongly pro-poor. Thus, it appears that&#13;
    the share o fpeople with incomesbelow the subsistence level will decline to below 15&#13;
    percent by the end o f 2006.&#13;
&#13;
16. Creditworthiness:Russia's macroeconomic performance resulted inrating agencies&#13;
    upgrading their sovereign credit risk.Moody's raised Russia's sovereign risk fi-om Ba2 to&#13;
    Baa3 (with "stable" outlook), and Standard andPoor's - EromBB to BBB - for local&#13;
    currency borrowings andBB+for foreign currency borrowings (with"stable" outlook).&#13;
    Thus, Russiawas, for the first time inits history, given aninvestment grade ratingby&#13;
    Moody's. Aside from good fiscal performance andlarge trade surpluses, ratingagencies&#13;
    emphasized political stability, progress inmacroeconomic management, the continued&#13;
    implementation o f tax reform andthe level o f foreign reserves. On the negative side, the&#13;
    sustainability o f Russia's growth was perceivedto be highly dependent on international&#13;
    oil and gas prices.&#13;
&#13;
17. As for the Republic o fTatarstan, its social andeconomic development has been'generally&#13;
    corresponding to federal trends. Tatarstan has been growing steadily with the rate slightly&#13;
    above the Russianaverage. During2001-2005 the cumulative GRF' growth amountedto&#13;
    about 34% andits share inthe country's GDP in2005 was about 2.5%. Average real&#13;
    incomes o f the populationwere lower than the Russianaverage (6,997 rubles and7,848&#13;
   rubles respectively in2004), however, the subsistence level i s considerably lower inthe&#13;
    Republic due to lower housing services andtransport prices. Poverty indicators in&#13;
    Tatarstanare close to the national level - about 20% o f the population is livingbelow the&#13;
    subsistence level, however, a big share o fruralpopulation (24.6%) makes a considerable&#13;
   contributionto the overallpoverty indicators.&#13;
&#13;
18. Insum, the present macroeconomic framework is satisfactory for disbursement from the&#13;
   KMDLat this time.&#13;

11.       ProgressAgainst TrancheRelease Conditions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19. The release o fthe second tranche is contingent, pursuant to Section 2.02 (d) ofthe Loan&#13;
    Agreement, uponprogress satisfactory to the Bankwith respect to: (i)      progress achieved&#13;
    by the Borrower andthe City inthe carryingout o fthe Programo f actions to strengthen&#13;
    andreformthe economy o fthe City; (ii)     maintainingthe satisfactory macroeconomic&#13;
    policy framework o f the Borrower andthe City; and (iii)    specific core conditions&#13;
    described inSchedule 3 to the Loan Agreement o f June 3,2005. Progress interms o f the&#13;
    macroeconomic framework i s described inparas. 9-16 above.&#13;
&#13;
20. Progress incarrying out the Programhasbeen satisfactory, and there has beenno reversal&#13;
    o f the actions taken incompliance with the first tranche of the Loan. Inadditionto&#13;
    meetingthe specific tranche conditions, describedbelow, the City demonstrated&#13;
    substantial progress inreformingall core areas as outlinedinthe Letter ofDevelopment&#13;
    Policy, including strengthening the budget andfmancial management, improvements in&#13;
    public procurement andmunicipalproperty management, improved delivery o f social&#13;
    services through institutional development, monetization o f social payments and&#13;
    increased targeting o f assistanceto the poor, andreforms inthe housing andcommunal&#13;
    services aimed at fiscal sustainability andincreased competitioninthe sector.&#13;
&#13;
21. There are nine specific core conditions for the secondtyanche, as specified in Schedule 3&#13;
    o f the LoanAgreement. Seven o fthem have been hlly met, one conditionhas been&#13;
    substantially met, and one condition hasbecome redundant, as describedbelow:&#13;
&#13;
Condition 1. The 2006 fiscalyear budgetwith the concept and parameterssatisfactory&#13;
to the Bankhasbeenapprovedby the City.&#13;
&#13;
22. Conditionmet. Inall material aspects this conditionhas been met, though the&#13;
    expenditure levels andpatterns o f 2005 made implementation of this conditionvery&#13;
    difficult and insome cases mitigating and follow-up measureswere necessary as detailed&#13;
    below.&#13;
&#13;
         The city made significant efforts to help its budgetary institutions to stay in&#13;
         restructuring agreements with the federal social funds. Currently, o f245 budget&#13;
         entities only 40 entities have dropped fiom the restructuring agreements. To resolve&#13;
         thisproblem, anamount of 123 millionrubleshasbeenallocatedinthe 2006 city&#13;
         budget as a separate line itemandwas finally paid inOctober 2006 to cover overdue&#13;
         payables o fthesebudgetary institutions (fmes are expected to be restructuredby&#13;
         federal authorities).&#13;
         In2005,583.7 millionrubleswere paidto cover the overduepayables o fbudgetary&#13;
         entities. The revised annual city budget for 2006 incorporated 402.4 million rubles&#13;
         that were paid inOctober 2006 to eliminate overdue payables of budgetary entities&#13;
         (other than those coveredby the restructuring agreements with RF social funds),&#13;
         except fines which are expected to be restructuredby federal authorities.&#13;
         The city unexpectedly received about 4.8 billionrubles as a federal subvention for the&#13;
         city metro construction. These funds were earlier supposed to be allocated directly&#13;
         from the federal budget. As a result the amount o f total expenditures increased&#13;
         dramatically makingit impossible for the city to maintainthe agreed share o f 12&#13;
         percent o f social capital expenditures. As o f January 1,2006, this share was equal to&#13;
         7.3 percent. Without this federal subvention, this would have been almost 11percent.&#13;
         To compensate for this situation, the city decidedto allocate more funds for capital&#13;
         expenditures ineducation, health, and social protection inthe context o f 2006 budget&#13;
         incomparisonto 2005 budget. Inthe 2006 city budgetthis shareis budgetedat 15.3&#13;
         percent.&#13;
         The rate o f wage growth is capped by the rate o f growth for federal employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             - 7 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Condition2. The Cityhasdemonstratedthat there are nonew overduepayablesof the&#13;
city budgetandbudgetaryinstitutionsfromend-2004 to end2005.&#13;
&#13;
23. Conditionmet. Again, inall material aspects this conditionhas beenmet, thoughthe&#13;
    expenditure levels andpatterns o f 2005 made implementation o f this condition very&#13;
    difficult and mitigating measureswere necessary. During2005 the arrears of budgetary&#13;

&#13;
28. Conditionmet. The city has implemented the targetedpoverty benefitin2005 to about&#13;
    20 thousandfamilies or approximately 5 percento fhouseholdsinKazan. Inthe context o f&#13;
    the 2006 budget, the city has allocated over 70 mlnrubles for the targetedpoverty benefit,&#13;
    andrevisedthe criteriaandproceduresfor the administration ofthe benefit. The Bank&#13;

&#13;
29. Condition substantiallymet, i.e. inthe City Budget for 2006 there are (a) no budget&#13;
    subsidies to producers of heat; (b) fbnds for HCS consumption bybudgetorganizations&#13;
    and optimizationand levelingofheating tariffs took place, inter alia, through creationof a&#13;
    single sales anddistributioncompany. The City Budget has no subsidies for heat&#13;
    producers and468 millionrubles has beenallocated for HCS consumption bybudget&#13;
    organizations. Heatingtariffs for population throughout the city were leveled already in&#13;
    2005 despite the fact that heat inKazanhas beensuppliedby three different producers&#13;
    whose productioncosts differ at times. The same approachto tariff setting has been&#13;
    extendedinto 2006. OnJuly 11,2005 an Agreement to create a KazanHeating(sales)&#13;
    Joint Stock Company (KHJSC) was entered into between JSC Tatenergo, the City&#13;
    Administration's Committee for CommunalProperty Management (KUKI) andthe&#13;
    MinistryofLandandPropertyRelations oftheRepublicofTatarstanasmember&#13;
    founders. At the time of institution, the shares of the company were split at aratio of:&#13;
    72.5% (Tatenergo), 25% (City) and2.5% (Ministry). The material assets of the newly&#13;
    createdcompany include the pipeline contributedby Tatenergo andthe intra-city heat&#13;
    supplying network contributedby Kazenergo. The Company commencedits operations&#13;
    on October 1,2005.&#13;
&#13;
30. Eliminationof cross subsidization for the supply of water andwastewater (equal tariffs&#13;
    set for various categories of consumers) has not been fully achieved due to unexpected&#13;
    changes inthe federal regulations, however certainprogresshas beenmade andfirm&#13;
    commitments havebeenmadeby the city authorities to achieve this goal by 2008. On&#13;
    December 19,2005 the State Duma of Russiapassedimportantamendmentsto the&#13;
    Federal Law "On the principles of tariffregulation inHCS" that have taken away the&#13;
    right of municipalities to set tariffs for water andwastewater services andcappedthe&#13;
    annual tariff growth for population, apparentlybasedon social considerations on the eve&#13;
    of the parliamentary andpresidential elections scheduledfor 2007 and2008 respectively.&#13;
    After consultationwith the Bank, the city haspreparedandadoptedthe programof&#13;
    levelingwater tariffs for population andenterprisesby2008.&#13;
&#13;
Condition9. The City's water andwastewaterfacilities (Vodocanal)are managedbya&#13;
competitivelyselectedprivateoperator.&#13;
&#13;
31. The implementationofthis conditionhasbecome redundant, as the EBRD initiated&#13;
    a projectinsupport ofthe Vodokanalrehabilitationandmanagement&#13;
    improvements.The EBRDproject aims to finance the vodocanal's priority capital&#13;
    investments and corporate developmentto improve the municipalwater andwastewater&#13;
    infrastructure and services inthe city andwould involve a Russianruble700 million loan&#13;
    to the Kazanwater andwastewater managementutility"Vodocanal" for 10years to be&#13;
   partially guaranteedby the Republic of Tatarstan with a municipal support agreement&#13;
    signed by the city. A pre-financing agreement with preliminaryterms andconditions of&#13;
    the loanwas signed by EBRP,the vodocanal andthe city on July 19,2006. The EBRD&#13;
   receivedonNovember 1,2006 the letter signed by Mr. RustamMinnikhanov, the prime&#13;
   minister of Tatarstan, confirmingthat the Republic of Tatarstan is ready to issue apartial&#13;
    guaranteeto vodocanal in2007. At the moment, the EBRD andthe Republic are&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 9 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   negotiating preliminaryterms andconditions o f such a guarantee. Once approvedby the&#13;
    legislative council o f the Republic, the Republic's guarantee will be used as a security&#13;
    insteado f the city's partial guarantee.&#13;
&#13;
32. The Government o f Finlandhas allocated a grant to fundthe technical feasibility study,&#13;
    which currently is beingpreparedby the Finnishfirm Poyry Soil andWater with a view&#13;
    o f completion by end-November 2006. Consultants also conduct an environmental audit&#13;
    andprepare an environmental actionplanfor the city.&#13;
&#13;
33. The European Unionhas allocated a grant to conduct a financial audit o fthe company&#13;
    finances andprovide an independent review o f the city's finances. The assignment has&#13;
    been completedby a consortium o fthe ratingagency Standard andPoor's andthe&#13;
    auditing company M C D JSC.&#13;
&#13;
34. Uponthe completion o fthe feasibility study inend-November, the EBRDwill anticipates&#13;
    a review o fthe project by its Operational Committee on December 15,2006 andto&#13;
    submit it for approval to the BoardofDirectors inDecember 2006/January 2007. The&#13;
    loanandthe guarantee agreements are envisaged to be signed inJanuaryDebruary 2007&#13;
    inthis case.&#13;
&#13;
35. Duringthe implementation o f the EBRD Project, institutional support will be provided,&#13;
    i.e. twinningo f the vodocanal with an experienced corporate development support&#13;
    partner, most likely, a western water andwastewater utility(e.g. such program was&#13;
    successfully implementedbetween St. Petersburg vodocanal and Stockholm Water). The&#13;
    programwill include the preparation and adoption o f a corporate development plan,&#13;
    service agreement, tariffpolicy between the city andthe utility, review o fpotential&#13;
    options for corporatization andcomparison o f these options from financial, legal,&#13;
    operational andtax perspectives, outsourcing potential, public awareness campaign, etc.&#13;
&#13;
36. Inthe context o f the project preparation, a detailedprogram of improvements inthe&#13;
    vodocanal has beenprepared by the city, coordinated with the Bank andEBRD and&#13;
    adopted by the city authorities.&#13;
&#13;
37. Overall, the EBRDproject would seem to be an excellent vehicle to better prepare the&#13;
    vodocanal for subsequent corporatisation andprivatization.&#13;
&#13;
38. Audits. The audit o fthe Deposit Account for the first tranche and the audit o f the use o f&#13;
    the first tranche funds havebeen conductedby a qualified audit company under the terms&#13;
    o f reference agreed with the Bank.N o major issues have been identifiedby the auditor.&#13;
    The audit reports have beenreviewedby the Bank andsome clarifications have been&#13;
    requestedthat are being currently preparedbythe Borrower.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
39. ConclusionandRecommendation&#13;
&#13;
40. The Borrower's implementation o f the Programhas beenvery good. The macroeconomic&#13;
    and fiscal framework has been satisfactory during the Programperiod. The Borrower and&#13;
    the City have fully met seven out o f the nine core conditions o f the second tranche&#13;
    release, andhave substantially met one more conditionrelatingto the improvements in&#13;
    the housingandcommunal sector (except full eliminationo f cross-subsidizationbetween&#13;
    water users that was preventedby an unexpectedtariffincrease caps introduced inthe&#13;
    national legislation). Implementation o f one core condition, i.e. transfer of the city's water&#13;
    and wastewater facilities to a competitivelyselected private operator, has become largely&#13;
    redundant as the EBRDstandalone project came onboardandits expected development&#13;
    impact is believed to meet the spirit o fthis loan. Iti s proposedthat this condition is&#13;
    waived. Progress inrespect to non-core conditions o f the programo f the Letter o f&#13;
    Development Policy has been satisfactory inall material aspects. Inview o f the overall&#13;
    performance andprogress with the implementation o fthe Programsupportedby the Loan,&#13;
                                            - 10-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
it is recommendedthat the ExecutiveDirectorsapprove the proposedwaiver. Subjectto&#13;
no-objectionby the ExecutiveDirectors, IBRDwill notify the Borrower that the second&#13;
tranche ofUSD 75 millionhasbeenmade availablefor disbursementto the Borrower.&#13;

            Russia - Kazan Municipal Development Loan :
            release of the second tranche and waiver of one condition
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Kazan municipal development loan for
            Russia's implementation of the Program has been very
            good. The macroeconomic and fiscal framework has been
            satisfactory during the Program period. The Borrower and the
            City have fully met seven out of the nine core conditions of
            the second tranche release, and have substantially met one
            more condition relating to the improvements in the housing
            and communal sector (except full elimination of
            cross-subsidization between water users that was prevented
            by an unexpected tariff increase caps introduced in the
            national legislation). Implementation of one core condition,
            i.e. transfer of the city's water and wastewater
            facilities to a competitively selected private operator, has
            become largely redundant as the EBRD stand alone project
            came on board and its expected development impact is
            believed to meet the spirit of this loan. It is proposed
            that this condition is waived. Progress in respect to
            non-core conditions of the program of the Letter of
            Development Policy has been satisfactory in all material
            aspects. In view of the overall performance and progress
            with the implementation of the Program supported by the
            Loan, it is recommended that the Executive Directors approve
            the proposed waiver. Subject to no-objection by the
            Executive Directors, IBRD will notify the Borrower that the
            second tranche of USD 75 million has been made available for
            disbursement to the Borrower.
