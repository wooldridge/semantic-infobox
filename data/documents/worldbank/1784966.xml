THE KINGDOM OF TONGA&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX FOR A PROPOSED CREDIT FOR A&#13;
CYCLONE EMERGENCY RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
I.    COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The archipelago of the Kingdom of Tonga comprises 170 islands in three main island&#13;
groups extending over 700 km in the South Pacific, and is prone to cyclones typically up to&#13;
Force 4 (Cyclone Category C). The population of 98,000 is primarily Polynesian, with a literacy&#13;
rate close to 99 per cent and a low incidence of poverty. The fiscal situation in the country is&#13;
generally deteriorating, and real GDP growth, after strengthening in 1999/00 to 6 percent, is&#13;
estimated to have slowed to about 3 percent in 2000/01 (largely due to lower agricultural&#13;
production). GDP is dominated by the services sector with a 60 per cent contribution, while&#13;
agriculture and industry contribute 30% and 10% respectively. The country must import a high&#13;
proportion of its food, and relies on tourism for hard currency earnings. Tonga remains&#13;
dependent on sizable external aid and remittances from Tongan communities overseas to offset&#13;
its trade deficit. The government is starting to emphasize the development of the private sector,&#13;
especially the encouragement of investment, and is committing increased funds for health and&#13;
education. Tonga has a reasonable basic infrastructure and well-developed social services.&#13;
II. THE CYCLONE DISASTER&#13;
The Cyclone Damage Estimates&#13;
2.    Tropical Cyclone Waka struck the Niuafo'ou and Niuatoputapu island group late on&#13;
December 30, 2001, and the Vava'u island group on December 31, 2001, with maximum&#13;
sustained winds at 100 knots and gusts to 140 knots (200 km/h), with moderate rainfall. The&#13;
cyclone caused substantial damage to buildings, trees, food and cash crops, and power, but there&#13;
were no fatalities or major injuries and negligible damage to transport infrastructure or land. The&#13;
damage was widespread and variable, and was worst in the Vava'u and Niuafo'ou islands, and&#13;
moderate on the Niuatoputapu and Ha'apai islands. The affected population totaled about 26,500&#13;
persons or 4,600 households.&#13;
3.    The effects of the cyclone were most evident on weak structures (mainly old houses and&#13;
poorly built community buildings) and roofs, and on crops and trees. On Vava'u sixty percent of&#13;
buildings were damaged, including about twenty percent completely demolished or severely&#13;
damaged. Many rain water collection systems were damaged or destroyed, but water tanks were&#13;
largely undamaged. The issues that required immediate attention included school repairs,&#13;
replanting of crops, repairs to private buildings, and providing domestic water supply&#13;
connections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
4.    The government's report on damage assessment in January 2002 estimated losses of TOP&#13;
104.4 million (USD 48 m), and a relief and rehabilitation program of TOP 79.5 m (USD 36 m).&#13;
The damage estimates included 1500 homes (TOP 70 m); 25 schools (TOP 7.4 m); agriculture&#13;
and fisheries (TOP 24 m); water supply, power, telecommunications and government property,&#13;
including minor damage to wharves and jetties (TOP 3.0 m). Subsequent detailed assessments&#13;
confirmed the physical extent of damage, and assessed the core needs for the recovery program&#13;
to comprise 512 homes (TOP 8 m), schools (TOP 1.5 million), and agriculture and fishing (TOP&#13;
0.1 Im), with other needs being met by local communities.&#13;
Response to the Cyclone Emergency&#13;
5.    Within the first few days after the cyclone, the Australian and New Zealand Governments&#13;
provided immediate relief assistance with aerial survey, damage assessment, and the delivery of&#13;
tents, covers, water-purification tablets and emergency supplies. The Canada Fund redirected&#13;
aid to school repairs which are being managed by TANGO, the national association of NGOs.&#13;
Domestically, the Governor of Vava'u reacted proactively in working with communities to&#13;
provide shelter, and organizing returning teachers to partially restore schools. On January 20,&#13;
the Government formed a special task force under Chief of Staff for Recovery from Cyclone&#13;
Waka, comprising three senior officials, and this office (OCOS) has worked with the Vava'u&#13;
Disaster Management Committee (VDMC) to direct the recovery operations and manage donor&#13;
funds. A recovery program was presented to a meeting of donors on January 24, 2002.&#13;
Response Gap and the Response by IDA&#13;
6.    Bi-lateral donors, such as Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Canada Fund,&#13;
are meeting all requirements for school repairs, with an amount totaling about TOP 1 million&#13;
(USD 0.5 million). France and Europe have provided smaller amounts for schools and relief&#13;
supplies, and others for agriculture. In housing, a total of 512 houses were destroyed and require&#13;
replacement, and about 1,000 more were substantially damaged. About 60-80 houses have been&#13;
pledged by Caritas (30) and Australia (30-50), leaving a gap of 430-450 houses, with an&#13;
estimated cost of about TOP 7 million for low-cost cyclone-resistant units. Assistance is also&#13;
requested for strengthening the national emergency and risk management framework. Following&#13;
the donors' meeting on January 25, 2002, the Government requested IDA assistance on housing&#13;
and emergency and risk management on March 13, and the preparation and appraisal of an IDA&#13;
Credit covering about 400 house units was conducted from April 8 to 16, 2002.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
7.    Relevant lessons can be drawn from international and Bank experience in disaster&#13;
management, from other projects in the Pacific Islands, and from the few previous operations in&#13;
Tonga (e.g., Second Tongan Development Bank Project). First, for housing assistance, the aim&#13;
should be to provide most assistance to the poor who have no access to insurance; to bring&#13;
existing good sector policies and practices to bear upon housing reconstruction; and to encourage&#13;
mitigation measures that reduce future impacts. Second, the experience with developing a risk&#13;
management strategy in Samoa has shown the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach&#13;
to risk assessment, involving active community participation in formulating and agreeing on&#13;
mitigation plans, and of upgrading information technology. The Samoa project has also shown&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
the benefits of effective project management in a dedicated unit, and the positive influence that&#13;
Bank procurement procedures can have on national procurement procedures.Third, the&#13;
management of funds and small loans warrants caution and strong fiduciary provisions because&#13;
these were not managed well by the Tongan Development Bank under previous assistance.&#13;
Finally, an emergency lending operation should not aim to address long-term policy issues or&#13;
sector reforms but may support them to the extent that is practical.&#13;
Rationale For IDA Involvement&#13;
8.    The financing gap in the recovery efforts is beyond the financial capacity of the&#13;
Government at this time, when international reserves are low and the current account deficit is&#13;
widening. IDA support would be directly benefiting very poor households who constitute the&#13;
great majority of those impacted by the cyclone. Reducing the vulnerability of small island states&#13;
to economic and physical shocks is a focus of the Bank's Pacific regional strategy. IDA can&#13;
provide support from international experience in emergency management processes (Disaster&#13;
Management Facility), a successful coastal infrastructure risk management activity in Samoa, the&#13;
Climate Change Adaptation initiative, and work on catastrophe insurance in Vanuatu.&#13;
Successful models for provision of emergency housing and for building a risk management&#13;
strategy are available in this Bank work and can be augmented through regional partners such as&#13;
SOPAC.&#13;
III. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
9.    The main objective is to assist in recovering the standard of living of the population&#13;
affected by the cyclone through the rehabilitation of the social infrastructure in selected affected&#13;
areas and to improve its resilience to natural hazards.&#13;
10.   The second objective is to strengthen and upgrade the emergency and risk management&#13;
capacity of the country through the improvement of its nationwide resilience to natural hazards,&#13;
including the effects of climate change.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
11.   The project would assist recovery of social infrastructure in the affected area, through&#13;
rapid replacement of destroyed or damaged housing, and over three years strengthen the national&#13;
capacity for emergency and risk management. The project components are as follows:&#13;
A.    Social Infrastructure Recovery (USD 4.2 m, 67% of total costs)&#13;
A. I  Replacement Housing (US$3.4 million, 54% of total costs):  Construction and&#13;
supervision of about 400 units of low-cost cyclone-resistant housing in the Vava'u group,&#13;
and Niuafo'ou and Niuatoputapu islands, to replace completely damaged houses of&#13;
households with inadequate financial capacity to rebuild.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
A.2  4ssisted Reconstruction of Community Buildings (US$0.26 million, 4% of total project&#13;
costs): Assistance to community-based works for reconstruction or retrofitting of community&#13;
buildings for hazard-resistance in about 40 villages of Vava'u, including Niuafo'ou and&#13;
Niuatoputapu islands through the provision of grants. The acceptance of sub-projects and&#13;
certification of works would be implemented by the VDMC, with the guidance of a technical&#13;
specialist. The payment of the grants would be administered by the PMU upon certification&#13;
by the VDMC, and audited on statements of expenditure. It is anticipated that the grants&#13;
would be approximately equal in size, with variation in exceptional cases at the discretion of&#13;
the VDMC.&#13;
A.3 Retrofitting of Existing Houses and Enterprises (US$0.53 million, 8% of total project&#13;
cost):  Assistance to community-based works for voluntary retrofitting and upgrading the&#13;
natural hazard resistance of residential and small-to-medium enterprise buildings nationwide,&#13;
through the provision of grants of up to TOP 5,000 to individuals or firms in the form of a&#13;
1:1 subsidy for approved treatments. The acceptance of sub-projects and certification of&#13;
works would be implemented under a contract with a firm or an NGO, with the guidance of a&#13;
technical specialist (same as in A.2). The payment of the grants would be administered by&#13;
the PMU upon certification by the implementing entity, and audited on statements of&#13;
expenditure.&#13;
B.    Emergency and Risk Management Capacity-Building (USD 1.8 m, 29%     of&#13;
project cost)&#13;
B.1 Strengthening of Emergency and Risk Management Processes (US$0.80 million, 13%&#13;
of total project cost): Reduction of vulnerability to disasters through improved effectiveness&#13;
of all phases of emergency management at national and local levels, through advisory&#13;
services and community training, with focus on (i) institutional arrangements and financial&#13;
resource options for risk reduction, readiness, response and recovery phases; (ii) training and&#13;
equipment for improved readiness and response; and (iii) A public information and education&#13;
program on proactively reducing risks to natural hazards, and on disaster preparedness.&#13;
B.2 Land and Risk Information (US$0.80 million, 13% of total project cost):&#13;
Establishment of updated high-resolution land and geographic information system for&#13;
support of risk management and for many sectoral applications, including: (i) aerial&#13;
photography and mapping of all main island groups; (ii) establishment of geographic&#13;
information system for national use; and (iii) development and implementation of a national&#13;
risk mitigation strategy for natural hazards and climate change effects, including risk&#13;
assessment for key hazards in vulnerable areas.&#13;
B.3 Improvement of Building Standards (US$0.20 million, 3% of total project cost):&#13;
Implementation and dissemination of improved building code and controls, and training of&#13;
building industry, through advisory services, training and workshops.&#13;
C. Project Management (USD 0.27 m, 4% of project cost):&#13;
C.J Project Management (US$0.27 million, 4% of total project cost): Management and&#13;
coordination of project activities, procurement, financial management and accounting,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
monitoring of environmental and social safeguards requirements, auditing of project&#13;
accounts, monitoring and reporting, etc.&#13;
12.   In parallel to the project, other housing support is being provided by two sources under&#13;
separate financing and implementation arrangements, i.e.: (i) Caritas Oceania (an NGO liaising&#13;
through the Catholic Church of Tonga) - 30 houses, selected on the basis of high social risk and&#13;
poverty, and involving owner or community contributions in kind; and (ii) the Australian&#13;
Government - about 30-50 houses. The total number of houses committed, therefore is 460-480,&#13;
leaving 32-52 houses requiring finance. The project would finance additional houses if savings&#13;
are realized through procurement or other parts of the Project. All houses will be of standard&#13;
design based on the low-cost cyclone-resistant house model built by MOW after the 1982&#13;
Cyclone Isaac, comprising a single room of about 35 sq. m area (4.9 m by 7.3 m). The Project&#13;
provides for updating of the design to conform with current best practice, and for fast&#13;
implementation of the housing component by December 2002 in view of the extent of&#13;
homelessness and the onset of the next wet and cyclone season in November. A detailed&#13;
description of the project components, including technical background on the building industry,&#13;
is presented in Appendices I to 3 of this Technical Annex.&#13;
Project Cost and Financing&#13;
13.    The total baseline project costs are estimated at USD 6.31 million equivalent, with a&#13;
foreign exchange component of USD 5.19 million equivalent (83%) and taxes and duties&#13;
estimated at about USD 0.17 million (2.6%). The Government has provided special tax&#13;
exemption for most recovery activities, including all of the project activities except consultant&#13;
services'. This total cost comprises: (i) civil works (housing construction) for USD 4.11 million&#13;
equivalent (65%); (ii) goods (aerial survey and mapping, and information technology) for USD&#13;
0.42 million equivalent (7%); (iii) consulting services for USD 1.68 million (27%); (iv)&#13;
training, workshops and incremental operating costs for USD 0.10 million equivalent (1%). A&#13;
summary of project costs by component is presented in Table 1, and detailed costs are shown in&#13;
Appendix 4 to this Technical Annex.&#13;

The Government indicated at negotiations an intention to exempt foreign consultant services for the Project from taxation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
14.   From the total financing required of USD 6.31 million equivalent, IDA would finance&#13;
US$5.85 million equivalent (100% of foreign exchange costs and 70% of local costs excluding&#13;
taxes). The proposed IDA financing would cover 93% of total project costs and 95.3% of the&#13;
total costs net of taxes and duties. The GOT would finance the remaining expenditures estimated&#13;
at US$0.46 million equivalent, including US$0.17 million of taxes and duties. A breakdown of&#13;
the financing plan and the estimated disbursement schedule are shown in Appendix 4 of this&#13;
Technical Annex. This Technical Annex is distributed in support of the Memorandum and&#13;
Recommendation of the President, Report No. P 7533-TON dated May 7, 2002.&#13;
IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization and Management&#13;
15.   Oversight. The government would establish a Project Coordination Committee (PCC),&#13;
chaired by the Secretary of Finance and comprising representatives of all agencies involved in&#13;
implementation of the project, i.e.: Ministry of Works (MOW), Ministry of Lands, Survey and&#13;
Natural Resources (MLSNR), Central Planning, National Disaster Management Office (NDMO)&#13;
and VDMC. The PCC would be responsible for the overall coordination of the project&#13;
implementation and achieving all the performance indicators.&#13;
16.   A Project Management Unit (PMU) under the PCC would be responsible for the day-to-&#13;
day management, monitoring and coordination of the project activities. The PMU will be located&#13;
within the Ministry of Finance, and comprise a Project Manager/Procurement Officer, Finance&#13;
Officer, Project Accountant, and Administrative Assistant. The PMU will be responsible for&#13;
project accounting and financial management in cooperation with the Treasury Department,&#13;
Ministry of Finance. It will report on a monthly basis on progress in project implementation.&#13;
17.   Implementing Agencies. There are three implementing agencies - Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MOF), Ministry of Works (MOW), and Ministry of Lands, Survey and Natural Resources&#13;
(MLSNR) - that will implement the respective components under the project, as follows:&#13;
(a) Ministry of Finance:                      Components A.2, B. 1 and C;&#13;
(b) Ministry of Works:                        Components A. 1, A.3 and B.3&#13;
(c) Ministry of Lands, Survey and Natural Resources  Component B.2.&#13;
Under the guidance of the PMU, the implementing agencies will be responsible for project&#13;
procurement, including preparation of bidding documents, evaluation and contract award,&#13;
inspection and certification of completion of works, and management of contracts.&#13;
18.   Implementation: The main housing component (A. 1) would be undertaken through a&#13;
single ICB contract for the construction of 400 houses by December 2002, in order to achieve&#13;
reliable and fast implementation and low costs, supervised by a firm to be selected through&#13;
quality and cost-based selection (QCBS). A preliminary list of housing recipients was reviewed&#13;
at appraisal and their eligibility will be verified through a survey to be conducted prior to&#13;
construction of the houses - the eligibility criteria and the list of villages involved are presented&#13;
in Appendix 1 (see Table 2). The community-based works for reconstruction of community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
buildings in Vava'u (A.2) are to be managed by the PMU through the VDMC who would&#13;
administer the selection of subprojects and certify completion. The community-based works for&#13;
retrofitting of existing buildings throughout the country (A.3) are to be managed by MOW&#13;
through a firm or NGO who would be appointed to administer the selection of subprojects and&#13;
certification of completion. For both A.2 and A.3, specialist technical oversight and guidance&#13;
will be provided through MOW and its advisors, and all grants for the community-based works&#13;
would be administered by the PMU. The advisory services for emergency and risk management,&#13;
and development of a risk mitigation strategy would be provided through an international&#13;
consulting firm selected by QCBS, acting in partnership with programs implemented by SOPAC.&#13;
The aerial surveys and development of spatial information systems would be procured through&#13;
ICB and managed by the MLSNR. The PMU and an independent audit firm will both be&#13;
appointed at the beginning of the Project, as conditions of effectiveness.&#13;
19.   Project implementation is expected to be completed by June 30, 2005. The Closing Date&#13;
of the Credit will be December 31, 2005.&#13;
Financial Management and Disbursement and Reporting&#13;
20.   A formal assessment of the financial management capacity was performed on all of the&#13;
implementing agencies of the project. This indicates the need to strengthen the financial&#13;
management system of the various implementing government ministries and agencies to meet the&#13;
Bank's minimum requirements for financial management. Moreover, there are parallel programs&#13;
which would strengthen the financial management and accounting systems of some of the&#13;
Government agencies, and address relevant financial management issues such as good&#13;
governance practices and strengthening of the planning, monitoring and reporting capability of&#13;
the ministries. The World Bank could complement initiatives on further strengthening of the&#13;
financial management systems in various government agencies in future projects, which would&#13;
require a broader and in-depth evaluation to harmonize with the works of the donors and ADB.&#13;
Meanwhile, to ensure the smooth implementation of the project, the Government agreed to&#13;
install an integrated financial management information and accounting systems that could&#13;
generate the reporting information required to meet both international accounting standards&#13;
(IAS) and the Bank's minimum requirements.&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
21.   GOT/MOF would pass on IDA funds through the MOF's coordinating team to the&#13;
various implementation agencies (MOW and MLSNR) in accordance with the prevailing policies&#13;
and procedures applicable for IDA funds with GOT bearing the foreign exchange risk. These&#13;
funds will usually be transferred from IDA to the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT), into&#13;
a Special account held in the name of MOF, and otherwise by direct payment to the payee. The&#13;
counterpart funds will be transferred through the MOF at the beginning of the year through&#13;
annual budgetary allocations (based on annual procurement work plans). The local currency&#13;
Project Account, to be set-up in the NRBT and funded in Pa'anga, will serve as the depository of&#13;
counterpart funds for the project.&#13;
&#13;

Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
22.   The Borrower will open and maintain a Special Account (SA) at the National Reserve&#13;
Bank of Tonga, which is capable of providing efficient payment and clearing facilities. IDA&#13;
would, upon request, make an authorized allocation of US$585,000. Initially, the allocation&#13;
would be limited to US$200,000, until disbursements have reached SDR 2.0 million, at which&#13;
time the full authorized allocation could be claimed. The SA will be maintained by the&#13;
coordinating team. These amounts would be used only for the purposes of the project to cover&#13;
its project expenditures. Disbursements under the credit will be made on a transactional basis,&#13;
using SOEs, for (a) grants, (b) goods, (c) contracts for the employment of consulting firms&#13;
costing less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract, (d) contracts for the employment of&#13;
individual consultants costing less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract; (e) training and&#13;
workshops, and (f) incremental operating costs. In addition, the Borrower will open a local&#13;
currency account in the Central Bank, for depositing the GOT's counterpart financing&#13;
contributions for the project. Supporting documents will be maintained by the coordinating team,&#13;
and made available to the IDA's visiting missions and auditors as required. The coordinating&#13;
team will also prepare and provide to IDA its quarterly reports on implementation progress along&#13;
with Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) in formats agreed with the IDA. The FMRs will be&#13;
used for monitoring purposes. These arrangements are discussed in detail in Appendix 5 to this&#13;
Technical Annex.&#13;
Audit&#13;
23.   Project accounts will be audited on a semi-annual and annual basis in accordance with&#13;
international auditing standards by an independent auditor acceptable to the IDA. The auditor's&#13;
report will be made available to the IDA within six months of the close of the fiscal year for the&#13;
annual audit and within 45 days after the semi-annual closing of books, every 15th of August and&#13;
February. The audits will include a separate opinion on the SOE, the Special Account, sub-&#13;
projects work, and grants. The first audit (for the financial year 2002) would include a review&#13;
and commentary on the adequacy of internal controls and a post-review of 2002's financial&#13;
statements. A qualified, independent external auditor, acceptable to the IDA, would be appointed&#13;
within two months after project effectiveness. The costs of annual audits will be made by the&#13;
from the proceeds of the Credit.&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
24.   Retroactive financing of up to SDR 940,000 (US$1.17 million) (20% of the proposed&#13;
Credit amount) would be available for eligible expenditures incurred since April 16, 2002, which&#13;
is the date of completion of the Bank's appraisal, provided they comply with the agreed&#13;
procurement guidelines. This provision would allow for the Credit to cover project preparation&#13;
activities and for the main contract to be procured in time to achieve completion by the end of&#13;
2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
Project Sustainability&#13;
25.   As the key focus of the project is rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure, future&#13;
maintenance needs are minimized through the hazard-resistant design and evidence of past&#13;
robustness. For other aspects, the provisions for extensive dissemination on risk mitigation&#13;
techniques through training in application of the new building code, for inspectors, builders and&#13;
homeowners, is expected to gradually change building practices and thus progressively reduce&#13;
the vulnerability of buildings to natural disasters. This, together with the incentives provided for&#13;
retrofitting of existing buildings for hazard resistance, should extend the improvement in&#13;
resilience of buildings well beyond the affected area. In respect of emergency management, the&#13;
lessons learned from the response to TC Waka, the additional information tools, and the&#13;
restructured institutional arrangements, are expected to result in a more sustainable and effective&#13;
organization and procedures.&#13;
Environmental and Social Aspects&#13;
26.   The magnitude of adverse environmental impacts is expected to be minor. The types of&#13;
environmental issues that may arise relate to land clearing for site preparation, movement of&#13;
workers, equipment, and materials to and from project site, and proper disposal of debris. Civil&#13;
works contracts for housing reconstruction works will include special technical provisions&#13;
specifying good environmental practices, in compliance with the environmental requirements of&#13;
the Bank. The supervising consultants will be responsible for ensuring that environmental&#13;
requirements as contractually stipulated are followed.&#13;
27.   The majority of the affected population is from socio-economic groups least able to cope&#13;
with loss of home and income. The affected households tend to be large in size, 6- 8 household&#13;
members, and are engaged primarily in subsistence agriculture and fishing. Cash incomes are&#13;
low and tentatively in the range of TOP 1,200 to TOP 2,000 per year per household. Financial&#13;
capacity to re-build homes to cyclone-resistant standards was reported to be limited. It is&#13;
therefore anticipated that the replacement of housing under the project will have positive social&#13;
impacts.&#13;
Potential Land Tenure Issues&#13;
28.   Most of the activities under the project are restoration works and do not therefore require&#13;
any new land acquisition from local land owners, or alienation of land under different tenure&#13;
systems. Since no new land, which is being otherwise used by anyone for residence or&#13;
cultivation, is expected to be acquired or alienated, there is little likelihood of any clearance of&#13;
squatters or encroachers. Bank guidelines require that households establish ownership or usufruct&#13;
to the land where the houses will be rebuilt. Accordingly, eligibility criteria for participation in&#13;
the project include documentary evidence to establish legal ownership or continued occupation&#13;
of the house by the current occupant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Participatory Approach&#13;
29.   Civil society has been extensively consulted during the preparation of the project. The&#13;
project design has been presented to and reviewed by NGO representatives and local church&#13;
organizations; views and information were obtained from local tradesmen, builders, and private&#13;
commercial banks. Continued involvement of the beneficiaries is built into the project&#13;
implementation arrangements. Implementation will include engagement of a local NGO for the&#13;
public information and education campaign, and possibly for monitoring the community building&#13;
and retrofitting components.&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
30.   There are four primary sources of benefits from the Project. Direct benefits will accrue to&#13;
the poor and others made homeless or affected by the cyclone through first, a more secure and&#13;
resilient dwelling, and second through the financial asset value of the house. Second, deferred&#13;
benefits will accrue to the country through a reduction of potential damage costs and loss of&#13;
productivity when another cyclone emergency strikes. Third, citizens will be better prepared,&#13;
less vulnerable to injury or loss, and expect-faster and more effective response in terms of&#13;
emergency information, rescue and relief supplies as a result of the improved ERM procedures.&#13;
Finally, all public and private economic assets could be better protected and less vulnerable to&#13;
damage as a result of the hazard mapping, and the risk management strategy and individual&#13;
plans, resulting in lower risks and exposure to risk and consequently lower damage and recovery&#13;
costs.&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
31.   The risks in the project include controllable and uncontrollable risks. The risk of further&#13;
natural hazards - storm, earthquake or tsunami - are moderate to substantial. The damage risk&#13;
from major cyclone-level storms is about 5 times higher than from major earthquakes - major&#13;
cyclones occur every 10 years and minor cyclones 2 years on average, and major earthquakes&#13;
about 50 years on average - however, these frequencies may change and intensities may worsen&#13;
in the coming decades as a result of global warming. Controllable risks include: (i) weak&#13;
implementation capacity, including slow or flawed procurement; (ii) financial risk in potential&#13;
for mismanagement of funds; (iii) slow or inaccurate accounting; (iv) inappropriate selection of&#13;
beneficiaries; and (v) low absorption of institutional strengthening and training. These risks will&#13;
be mitigated through the financial management, procurement and implementation arrangements&#13;
defined for the project.&#13;
Agreed Actions&#13;
32.   The following were agreed at negotiations as conditions of effectiveness:  (i)&#13;
Establishment of the Project Coordination Committee; (ii) Establishment of the Project&#13;
Management Unit; (iii) Appointment of an independent auditor with qualifications and&#13;
experience and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA; (iv) Evidence satisfactory to IDA on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
land tenure arrangements made with each affected household and beneficiary shall be furnished&#13;
to IDA; (v) Adoption of an Operational Manual; and (vi) Adoption of a project financial&#13;
management system in operational condition and satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
33.   Other actions, necessary to the prompt and effective implementation of the Project, were&#13;
agreed at negotiations, as follows: (i) Revision of the basic house design and preparation/issue&#13;
of bidding documents for housing construction contract by May 15, 2002; (ii) Completion of an&#13;
operational manual by May 31, 2002; (iii) Appointment of the Project Manager and Financial&#13;
Officer by June 15, 2002; (iv) Completion of a verification survey of intended housing&#13;
recipients, verifying their eligibility for housing assistance under the Project and collecting&#13;
baseline demographic profiles, by June 30, 2002; (v) Establishment of a revised national&#13;
emergency and risk management strategy and institutional framework satisfactory to IDA and&#13;
endorsed by Cabinet by October 31, 2002; (vi) Specific improvement of budgetary and executive&#13;
powers of the national management of emergencies and natural disasters satisfactory to IDA and&#13;
endorsed by Cabinet by October 31, 2002; and (vii) Draft regulations authorizing powers for&#13;
inspection and enforcement of building requirements for all buildings, under existing legislation,&#13;
would be agreed with MOH and submitted to Cabinet by November 30, 2002.&#13;

CYCLONE EMERGENCY RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT (CERMP)&#13;
HOUSING COMPONENT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The housing sector suffered the most as a result of the cyclone; according to government&#13;
estimates about 60% of all structures were damaged. Much of the damage was to old residential&#13;
houses and poorly constructed community buildings, such as churches and schools - damage to&#13;
education facilities delayed the start of the school year by two weeks. Of the affected structures,&#13;
about 10% were completely demolished, 20% suffered major roof and wall damage, and the&#13;
remainder were moderately damaged. The National Disaster Management Committee estimates&#13;
that 512 houses were completely destroyed and 1000 houses were partially or moderately&#13;
damaged, 23 community halls were completely damaged and 36 partially damaged in Vava'u&#13;
and Niuafo'ou. The majority of the buildings were uninsured, and the NDMC is compiling&#13;
information on the numbers of insured structures. Detailed and reliable field information,&#13;
including household information on affected households, is now being assembled.&#13;
Post-cyclone Relief Efforts&#13;
2.    In early January, the government appealed to the donor community for rehabilitation&#13;
assistance to mitigate the effects of the cyclone. In response, the Canada Fund redirected aid to&#13;
school repairs which is being managed by TANGO, an association of NGOs. Australia and New&#13;
Zealand are providing assistance of about US$360,000 to rehabilitate schools. Caritas (Catholic&#13;
Relief Services) is providing assistance for the reconstruction of 30 houses, in phases of 10. This&#13;
work is already under way - the selection process for the first set of 10 households has been&#13;
completed and construction has been initiated. Additionally, the Australian government has&#13;
confirmed grant funding for 30 units and the EU is considering providing a grant to assist&#13;
implementation of the IDA housing replacement program. On its part, IDA is proposing to&#13;
contribute about US$4.2 million towards reconstruction and retrofitting activities in the housing&#13;
sector.&#13;
Component Objective&#13;
3.    The primary objective of the proposed component is to assist the government of Tonga in&#13;
replacing and rehabilitating badly damaged social infrastructure in the urban and rural areas of&#13;
Vava'u affected by the cyclone, and to improve building resilience to natural hazards&#13;
nationwide.&#13;
Component Description&#13;
Component A - Housing Component (USD 4.2 million).&#13;
(see Appendix 4 for a detailed cost breakdown)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13 -                              Appendix l&#13;
4.    Sub-component Al: Construction of replacement housing (USD 3.4 million). The&#13;
principal objective of this sub-component is to assist the GOT in replacing approximately 400&#13;
housing units, representing about 80 percent of collapsed or heavily damnaged units in the&#13;
Vava'u island group. Units with missing roofs or missing roofs and walls are classified as&#13;
heavily damaged. Extensive consultations with government and civil society representatives&#13;
confirmed the choice of a standard residential unit to be provided to all beneficiaries. The&#13;
houses would be constructed on the previous house sites, and no relocation of houses is planned.&#13;
The existing housing model from the post-1982 recovery has proved to be robust with very few&#13;
of these units affected by TC Waka even about 20 years after construction. The housing model&#13;
provided under the proposed project will be the existing 2 room, 35 square meters, cyclone-&#13;
resistant unit developed and installed after the 1982 tropical cyclone Isaac, with modifications as&#13;
described in Appendix 2. The cost per unit of the updated standard model is estimated to be&#13;
TOP 16,000 (US$8,000), including transportation of materials and on-site installation.&#13;
5.    The government is currently in discussions with the European Union for the financing of&#13;
VIP latrines and water tank units for households in Vava'u. The combined cost of the water&#13;
tanks and VIP latrines is estimated at TOP 2,600 (US$1,300). It is proposed that if EU funding&#13;
is confirmed, the toilet and water tank units would be provided to the selected beneficiary&#13;
households under the IDA housing component. The EU funded works would then be a parallel&#13;
activity to this project.&#13;
6.    The Borrower has completed a preliminary assessment of affected households, and is&#13;
responsible for providing an update of the damage assessment and eligibility estimates by June&#13;
30, 2002. Based on this update, the Bank will review the total number of housing units to be&#13;
constructed in order to mitigate the risk of over-investments. The preliminary damage&#13;
assessment completed by the Vava'u Disaster Management Committee is summarized in Table 1&#13;
below. The table lists the numbers of households with completely or heavily damaged houses,&#13;
and who would be potentially eligible for replacement housing. A detailed list of the villages is&#13;
given in Table 2, which will be confirmed by June 30, 2002 following the verification survey,&#13;
and will be the basis for allocating houses for assistance, between financing agencies.&#13;

7.    Sub-component A2: Rehabilitation of community buildings (USD 0.26 million). A number&#13;
of public buildings, mainly schools and community halls, were also damaged during the cyclone.&#13;
While bilateral donors are providing assistance for re-building schools, there is as yet no&#13;
provision for community halls which are used for a variety of public and community activities.&#13;
This sub-component will finance the structural repair of about 40 community facilities in project&#13;
villages, including the design and supervision of the repair works. Each village will receive an&#13;
equal grant of about TOP 12,000 (US$6,000) towards rehabilitation costs; the beneficiary&#13;
communities are expected to contribute to the total costs of works in cash and/or kind. Works&#13;
under this sub-component will be managed by the PMU through the VDMC, who will be&#13;
responsible for selection and verification of the subprojects, and general supervision. They will&#13;
be assisted by a technical specialist under MOW to ensure that all civil works are completed to&#13;
cyclone resistant standards and comply with the draft building code.&#13;
8.    Sub-component A3: Retrofitting existing housing stock (USD 0.53 million). The majority&#13;
of the buildings damaged in the cyclone were structurally weak and ad hoc buildings. The&#13;
absence of construction standards hitherto means that across the country there are houses, shops,&#13;
and service establishments vulnerable to future cyclones. Approximately 250 households and&#13;
small businesses will receive grant assistance on a voluntary basis for upgrading structures to&#13;
cyclone resistant standards. Beneficiaries will be eligible to receive 50 percent of the estimated&#13;
repair costs, with a maximum grant of TOP 5,000 (US$2,500) per household or business&#13;
establishment for approved treatments. The acceptance of sub-projects and certification of works&#13;
would be implemented under a contract with a firm or an NGO, with the guidance of a technical&#13;
specialist (same as in A.2). The payment of the grants would be administered by the PMU upon&#13;
certification by the implementing entity, and audited on statements of expenditure.&#13;
Eligibility Criteria&#13;
9.    Sub-component Al. The MOW has developed, jointly with Caritas, criteria for the&#13;
selection of beneficiary households under the Caritas housing assistance program. Selection of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -                             Appendix I&#13;
beneficiaries is based on the number of children in the household, collapse of housing unit,&#13;
presence of elderly, infants, or widows in the household, absence of land allotment for&#13;
agriculture, and security of land tenure. The main filter is poverty. The initial selection of&#13;
beneficiaries is completed by the village church; the Caritas representative then interviews each&#13;
household to determine the level of poverty and need using a standard questionnaire and open&#13;
ended discussions, and makes the final selection along with the Vava'u Disaster Management&#13;
Committee (VDMC).&#13;
10.   For the proposed IDA project, the eligibility requirements will generally follow the&#13;
criteria developed by the MOW, except that social vulnerability will become a priority, not&#13;
selection, criterion and the financial criterion becomes the capacity to rebuild the house to&#13;
hazard-resistant standard. Thus, modifications have been made for this project. To receive&#13;
assistance under this component, potential beneficiaries must meet the following criteria:&#13;
i)    house is damaged beyond repair and requires complete replacement;&#13;
ii)   household has inadequate financial capacity and no cyclone insurance to rebuild the&#13;
house to cyclone-resistant standard; and&#13;
iii)  Legal verification of established and continuing occupancy of the housing site under&#13;
arrangements similar to those prior to the cyclone event, supported by a written&#13;
consent from the landowner.&#13;
Priority among the beneficiaries would be given to:&#13;
iv)   Households who have members at high risk, such as infants/small children, elderly,&#13;
handicapped, widowed and sick people; and&#13;
v)    Households in most needy social circumstances.&#13;
11.   The main modification to the VDMC criteria is the requirement regarding security of&#13;
land tenure. Under the Land Act of 1927, all Tongan males are entitled to a town allotment for&#13;
residential purposes, and a tax allotment of agricultural land. In reality, not all Tongan males&#13;
and households have such allotments. Due to the practice of land and estate holders allowing&#13;
occupancy and use of land through "words", that is, verbal commitments, there may be some&#13;
beneficiaries who lack documentation establishing the right to use of the land they occupy. To&#13;
ensure that land required for the project is legally available, and to ensure that current occupants&#13;
are not dispossessed of the houses provided under the project, all beneficiaries would be required&#13;
to produce one of the following documentary evidence establishing ownership or usufruct:&#13;
* Deed of grant (registration)&#13;
* Deed of lease&#13;
* Certificate of apportionment (blue form) from the MLSNR&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -                            Appendix 1&#13;
* letter from the land owner in favor of the current occupant, establishing continued&#13;
occupation of the land and replacement house. The letter can be either witnessed by a&#13;
third party or duly sworn affidavit before a magistrate or Commissioner of Oaths.&#13;
12.   Sub-component A3. All households and small-medium enterprises (excepting&#13;
manufacturing/industrial facilities) in the country are eligible to participate in this sub-&#13;
component. The beneficiaries will be selected on a first come, first served basis. Households and&#13;
businesses would be eligible for only one grant, irrespective of the number of structures owned.&#13;
Beneficiaries would receive 1:1 grant subsidies of up to TOP 5,000 for approved treatments.&#13;
They would be required to prepare a repair plan and undertake investments according to&#13;
standards which protect against future cyclone risks, and agree to inspection of the completed&#13;
repairs by the implementing firm or NGO.&#13;
Benefits and Target population&#13;
13.   Immediate benefits are the availability of housing services to the inhabitants of the&#13;
Vava'u islands group, including Niuafo'ou and Niuatoputapu. The project will directly benefit&#13;
the displaced persons forced to live in temporary shelters after the disaster by constructing&#13;
houses with improved standards and less vulnerability to future cyclones; and by introducing&#13;
techniques designed to restore confidence in the quality of construction. Since the majority of&#13;
the population affected by TC Waka has been shown to be of the lowest socio-economic groups,&#13;
the replacement housing will have direct impact on the poorest members of the community.&#13;
14.   Nationwide benefits will also result from the retrofitting component which will reduce&#13;
vulnerability of houses and small business structures to future hazards. The involvement of the&#13;
community in repair of community buildings and upgrading will strengthen the capacity of&#13;
community as a whole to build to higher standards and improve building resilience to hazards.&#13;
The involvement of civil society - churches, NGOs - would ensure community leadership and&#13;
ownership of the activities and enable communities to undertake future maintenance of&#13;
buildings.&#13;

EVALUATION OF BUILDING PRACTICES&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    A comprehensive evaluation of building practices in Tonga was completed, with a view&#13;
to providing long-term improvements, and to support the housing component. In the project&#13;

buildings to natural hazards.&#13;
Current Building Practice&#13;
2.    Building practices in Tonga can be generally classified as 'commercial' or 'non-&#13;
commercial'. The building consent procedure currently in place is controlled by the Ministry of&#13;
Health and is contained within the Public Health Act of 1992. Although it prescribes that all&#13;
buildings require a building consent, in practice this is limited to 'commercial' buildings only.&#13;
Building consent applications are made through the Ministry of Health which is responsible for&#13;
ensuring adequate levels of hygiene within buildings. This includes an assessment of kitchen and&#13;
food preparation areas (where applicable), fresh water supply provisions, and storm and waste&#13;
water disposal methods. The consent application is also checked by the Ministry of Works&#13;
(structural and architectural compliance), the Fire Department (Fire separation and suppression&#13;
compliance) and the Ministry of Lands Survey and Natural Resources (land tenure and site&#13;
clearances). Building permits are issued under the signature of the Minister of Lands and Survey&#13;
upon endorsement of permit application documents.&#13;
3.    The architectural check is generally limited to an overall acceptance of the plan layout&#13;
proposed. Consideration is given to ensure adequate separation between living, food preparation&#13;
and ablution areas are present and that external ventilation and lighting is available in habitable&#13;
spaces. These checks are experience based as there are currently no rules or guidelines&#13;
documented which clearly prescribe 'adequacy'.&#13;
4.    Structural adequacy involves the Ministry of Works engineering section. Consent&#13;
applications are usually accompanied by a certificate from a engineering consultant. Detailed&#13;
calculations are only reviewed when ambiguities are uncovered during the review. Responsibility&#13;
for building safety rests with the structural design engineer. Structural calculations are prepared&#13;
using either New Zealand or Australian Standards (or a combination of both). The design actions&#13;
usually use either AS 1170 Part 1 or NZS 4203 to determine the permanent and occupancy loads,&#13;
AS 1170 Part 2 to determine the wind forces and NZS 4203 Part 3 for the seismic loads.&#13;
5.    For wind and cyclone force determination for Ultimate Limit State (collapse avoidance)&#13;
compliance, design wind speeds of 75 m/sec are used. Figure 1 has been prepared from the&#13;
2002 edition of the joint New Zealand and Australian wind loading standard. This standard&#13;
recognizes differences in design wind speeds for claddings and overall structure, and together&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

with its 1989 predecessor, local acceleration effects, which occur with hilly topography. While&#13;
the reference wind speed of 75 mlsec is simple to apply across Tonga, reference to Figure 1&#13;
indicates the design wind speed should be increased for hill topographic effects but may be&#13;
reduced for flat sites. It appears to be generally accepted that Tonga can be considered as being&#13;
equivalent to Cyclone Zone C within the standard. The design return period applicable is&#13;
expected to be either 1/500 years (i.e. 10% probability of excedence over a 50 year design life)&#13;
or 1/200 (i.e. a similar probability of failure over a shorter design life or a 15% probability of&#13;
failure over 50 years).&#13;

6.     Earthquake design actions are currently determined by reference to the New Zealand&#13;
Loading Standard, NZS 4203 Part 3 with a lateral base shear coefficient of 0.25 being applicable&#13;
throughout Tonga. For building consent approval, the engineering consultant is required to&#13;
submit a design certificate indicating responsibility for the engineering integrity of the building,&#13;
and the Ministry of Works engineering check is predominantly an overview assessment.&#13;
7.     Figure 2 has been prepared to provide a comparison with the design spectra proposed for&#13;
different seismic zones in New Zealand. The approach used is that buildings can either be&#13;
designed to remain elastic (undamaged) during the design event, in which case the higher&#13;
coefficients in the left chart of Figure 2 should be used. Alternatively, for economy they may be&#13;
designed and detailed as either ductile or limited ductile buildings in which case some damage is&#13;
to be expected, and the building is designed to the lower base shear coefficients of the right chart&#13;
in Figure 2. The detailing provisions required to accompany the use of the lower base shear&#13;
coefficient are however quite rigorous. While they are prescribed in detail in the New Zealand&#13;
materials standards, the detailing provisions are absent from materials standards used in other,&#13;
non-seismic regions such as Australia. Thus the detailing provisions for concrete or masonry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -                              Appendix 2&#13;
buildings include the use of closely spaced, well anchored reinforcing ties or hoops in columns&#13;
and beam end zones to confine the main member reinforcement and to contain the concrete core&#13;
thus preventing loss of vertical load carrying capacity and thus storey collapse.&#13;
8.    Results from the earthquake hazard study undertaken by SOPAC (Shorten et al, 20002&#13;
have been used to develop the indicative elastic response spectra for Nuku'alofa. While the&#13;
spectral shape is different, particularly in the longer period range, the comparison with&#13;
Christchurch seismicity appears reasonable. This is consistent with the current lateral base shear&#13;
coefficient of 0.25g used throughout Tonga, provided the appropriate detailing is applied. When&#13;
buildings are designed solely in accordance with the Australian materials standards or other&#13;
standards which do not prescribe additional ductile detailing provisions for post-elastic&#13;
earthquake performnance, then the imposed base shear should be significantly greater that the&#13;
0.25g value currently used.&#13;
9.     Much of the construction within Tonga appears to be undertaken without the specific&#13;
limited ductility provisions necessary to use the lower design spectra and that the currently used&#13;
base shear coefficient of 0.25g is thus too low to ensure adequate earthquake performance&#13;
during a major seismic event.&#13;

10.   House Construction Practices and Design Requirements. Government housing designs in&#13;
Tonga are generally undertaken in accordance with the New Zealand Standard for timber&#13;
framing, NZS 3604, but with the lateral bracing resistance being achieved using plywood&#13;
sheathing panels rather than the gypsum plaster board lining commonly used in New Zealand.&#13;
11.   The distribution and breakdown of households by construction type for the Vava'u&#13;
district and for Tonga and Tongatapu are prescribed in Figure 3.&#13;

Figure 3: Household distribution of housing types (1996 census)&#13;
12.   Private dwellings are often of dubious quality with one or more of the following&#13;
structural weaknesses:&#13;
* A lack of discemable lateral wall bracing capacity with internal linings often poorly&#13;
connected to the framing or missing altogether.&#13;
* The lack of an effective load path to resist either wind uplift or any lateral forces.&#13;
* Inadequate footing and piles often used to elevate the structure over 1 meter above the&#13;
ground without cross bracing or lateral resistance.&#13;
* Wooden piles were seen to be weakened by decay or were being rebuilt using non-durable&#13;
timber.&#13;
* Concrete quality is often poor with several instances observed where piers have degraded&#13;
to the extent that vertical steel is visible and exposed to the weather.&#13;
* Corrugated iron is by far the most common formn of roof sheathing. It is fixed to the&#13;
purlins with nails. The recent introduction of Nuway spiral shank nails is now providing a&#13;
small (12mm diameter) metal washer which will assist resist sheathing pull-through but is&#13;
unlikely to provide sufficient resistance to cyclonic wind effects either in terms of nail&#13;
withdrawal capacity of or sheathing fatigue loading.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -                            Appendix 2&#13;
* Positive wind uplift connection of purlins to rafters and rafters to wall framing is&#13;
commonplace and was reflective of the widespread loss of roofing during TC Waka.&#13;
* The use of non-durable timber species as roof and wall framing members, when combined&#13;
with high humidity and significant rainfall, can be expected to result in an effective life of&#13;
the building of less than 25 years.&#13;
* While metal timber fasteners are generally galvanized, they are also often exposed to the&#13;
weather and used on sites well within the salt spray zone (500 m of the sea) where salt&#13;
deposits are expected. Many are clearly showing signs of rust development and&#13;
degradation.&#13;
The structural integrity of the buildings built in this manner is very unreliable.&#13;
13.   Cyclone damage during Tropical Cyclone Waka. Tropical Cyclone Waka began to&#13;
impact on the islands of Vava'u on the evening of December 3 lSt. The maximum sustained wind&#13;
speeds reported were estimated to be 100 knots (55 m/sec) with gusts up to 140 knots (78 m/sec).&#13;
The damage observed to buildings is generally consistent with that which can be expected for&#13;
buildings when they are subjected to severe winds. These generally involved the loss of the roof&#13;
structure (usually as a result of insufficient tie-down against wind uplift effects). Once the roof&#13;
was removed, the support provided by the roof/ceiling combination generally became ineffective&#13;
and the walls collapsed, often with both the roof and walls being carried significant distances&#13;
downwind. Damage to downwind property is common in these circumstances with flying debris&#13;
impacting on and damaging the integrity of the down-wind building envelope.&#13;
14.   TC Waka was particularly severe in this regard because the eye of the storm passed&#13;
directly over the islands. Thus high velocity winds were initially experienced from the North&#13;
West, and were followed by severe winds from the South East. This, in combination with the&#13;
relatively hilly terrain on the island, resulted in sites being exposed to very high wind speeds&#13;
either from one or other direction or from both. Fortunately the cyclone passage was rapid and&#13;
apparently, although accompanied by rain, this was not as severe as can be experienced during&#13;
cyclones.&#13;
15.   Reports of building damage and the inspections undertaken confirm that most building&#13;
failures resulted from poor standards of construction with little or no tie-down connections&#13;
between the elements of the building envelope. Many buildings were also old and showed clear&#13;
signs of deterioration. Some durability concerns were noted on schools and houses erected&#13;
following TC Issac (March 1982). These generally took the form of white or red rust deposits&#13;
being visible on galvanised metal surfaces, particularly when located on coastal sites. Some&#13;
examples of wall racking failures were also observed, although the building was unlined and had&#13;
a weatherboard plank exterior sheathing. No cases of foundation failure as a result of whole-&#13;
structure overturning were seen. One of the 1982 Tonga Hurricane houses did however&#13;
experience sub-floor racking failure, where the piled foundation was in an advanced stage of&#13;
decay.&#13;

Component Objective (B.3)&#13;
16.   Improvement of Building standards (US$0.20 million, 3% of total project cost): The&#13;
objective of this component is to assist the GOT in the implementation and dissemination of&#13;
improved building codes, and training of the building industry, through advisory services,&#13;
training and workshops.&#13;
Component description&#13;
17.   This subcomponent B.3 would include the following:&#13;
B.3. 1 Review of legislation under which the Code is to be enacted, the structure under&#13;
which it is intended to operate, and the technical approach upon which it has been&#13;
derived.&#13;
B.3.2 Development of a training program for the building control authorities to enable&#13;
the introduction of the Code.&#13;
B.3.3 Development of a public awareness campaign to bring the requirements and&#13;
implications of the new Code to the notice of local building contractors and&#13;
building owners.&#13;
B.3.4 Development of a set of guidelines describing how to retrofit existing houses to&#13;
improve their cyclone resistance.&#13;
Each of these activities is further described below.&#13;
B.3.1 Lezislative Review of Building Code&#13;
18.   Scope: Review of legislation supporting introduction of the Code, the structure under&#13;
which it is intended to operate and the technical approach upon which it has been derived.&#13;
19.   Issues:&#13;
(i)  Legislation initiating the enactment of the Code is set down for consideration by&#13;
Parliament within its next setting. The Code is available (3rd draft) and appears&#13;
closely aligned with the Building Code of Australia. Significant amendments are&#13;
to be called up within the Building Code of Australia in the July 2002 revision,&#13;
the implications of which need to be assessed prior to the adoption of the Code.&#13;
(ii)  While a local review of the Code has occurred during its preparation and has&#13;
resulted in the 3rd draft being prepared, changes have recently occurred in both&#13;
the regulations (stipulating the societal values and acceptable probability of&#13;
actions being exceeded) and the referenced standards (e.g. the publication of&#13;
AS/NZS 1170 parts 0 1 and 2 which require design return periods and acceptable&#13;
probability of failure of different classes of buildings to be nominated). These&#13;
changes create contradictions within the proposed Code that need to be resolved&#13;
before it is enacted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -                            Appendix 2&#13;
(iii)  Technical inconsistencies exist within this draft that need to be urgently rectified&#13;
if the adoption and application of the Code is to progress smoothly.&#13;
20.   Implementation Strategy:&#13;
(i)   A review of the proposed legal framework under which the Code is to operate is&#13;
required so as to ensure an appropriate structure is available to implement the&#13;
Code.&#13;
(ii)  A technical audit of the Code is required to ensure the current inconsistencies&#13;
between the referenced documents and proposed application procedures are&#13;
consistent and to not conflict of contradict each other.&#13;
21.   Procurement Requirements: A building performance specialist would be engaged to&#13;
review the proposed legislation under which the Code is to operate so as to ensure the intended&#13;
building performance criteria are consistent with and appropriate for the Kingdom. The specialist&#13;
is to allow for consultation with the Code drafting committee to ensure a clear understanding of&#13;
the performance objectives of the Code. This phase of work is expected to extend over 2 months&#13;
and has an estimated consultancy value of US$30,000 plus disbursements US$5000.&#13;
B.3.2 Training Program for Building Control Authorities&#13;
22.   Scope: Development of a training program for the building control authorities to enable&#13;
introduction of the National Building Code.&#13;
23.   Issues.&#13;
(i)  Need to cause a paradigm shift in the way that buildings are authorized and built.&#13;
This is particularly the case for the housing sector where there are currently no&#13;
approval requirements in place and no baseline against which performance levels&#13;
can be assessed.&#13;
(ii)  The successful implementation of the new Code requires suitably qualified and&#13;
trained building control officials to be in place to assist the industry and the&#13;
community as the new controls are brought into force.&#13;
(iii)  The building unit established to implement the Code must be well trained in the&#13;
procedures by which building consent applications are processed, the compliance&#13;
of the building in the field and the quality of that building is consistent with the&#13;
consent application, the occupancy certification that recognizes completion of the&#13;
building, compliance with the Code to the quality appropriate and the&#13;
responsibility of all parties in ensuring the requirements of the Code are met.&#13;
24.   Implementation Strategy: Develop a set of training programs for the building control&#13;
officials which:&#13;
(i)  Outline the legal framework under with the Code will operate with particular emphasis&#13;
on the role, responsibilities and limitations of the officials under that legislation. A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -                            Appendix 2&#13;
disputes resolution procedure for cases where compliance or approval issues can be&#13;
resolved would be included.&#13;
(ii)  Detail the new building code requirements and how they are to be satisfied.&#13;
(iii)  Provide a ready source which the inspectors can use reference as to the specific&#13;
requirements (particularly with regards housing) and the means of compliance&#13;
25.   Procurement Requirements: A professional training specialist would be engaged to&#13;
prepare a detailed training plan and workbooks that can be used and referenced by building&#13;
control officials on a day-by-day basis as they implement the new National Building Code. This&#13;
work should be implemented during the first 3 months of the program so as to be in place when&#13;
the regulations covering the Code are enacted. This phase of work is expected to extend over 6&#13;
months.&#13;
B.3.3 Public Awareness Campaign&#13;
26.   Scope: Development of a public awareness campaign to bring the requirements and&#13;
implications of the new Code to the notice of local building contractors and building owners&#13;
27.   Issues:&#13;
(i) The new Code will introduce a degree of building control never previously&#13;
present in Tonga. There is a very large knowledge gap throughout the community&#13;
and within the building industry as to what the implications of the Code are both&#13;
to the building occupier and to the building contractor.&#13;
(ii)  The new Code is performance oriented and has clearly stated performance&#13;
objectives within each of the section (e.g. Structural Stability, Fire, Electrical&#13;
reticulation, Hygiene, etc.). While the performance objectives are stated, they are&#13;
not quantified but rather rely on equivalence with deemed-to-satisfy provisions.&#13;
This concept is quite different from all previous experiences of the building&#13;
industry and will result in widespread confusion unless it is accompanied by a&#13;
well targeted education campaign.&#13;
(iii) There will predictably be a reluctance by many to accept the new controls since&#13;
there will be both an increase in the cost of buildings (as the quality of building&#13;
increases from its current very low base) and a control system which will preclude&#13;
much of the casual owner-builder approach which appears currently widespread&#13;
in Tonga.&#13;
28.   Implementation Strategy:&#13;
(i)  Prepare a wide-ranging public relations campaign with the specific aim of&#13;
introducing the new Code and its intended improvements to the public end users.&#13;
This campaign is likely to cover a limited Television public awareness campaign,&#13;
radio and the newsprint media. It is expected to specifically outline the intent and&#13;
benefits that improved building controls will have (e.g., building safety, cyclone&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -                             Appendix 2&#13;
resistance, healthier living standards, etc.) and the implications that such controls&#13;
have in constraining current non-consented building practices.&#13;
(ii)  Preparation of public information handouts which outline the essential features of&#13;
the new Code, the range of performance objectives contained within the Code and&#13;
a clear outline of the new procedures (and penalties) required under the code for&#13;
obtaining a building consent and final occupancy certificate. These handouts&#13;
would be available to the public both at the building control unit and from town&#13;
officers.&#13;
(iii)  Organize a series of public meetings that aim to bring the requirements of the&#13;
Code to community level. Such meetings are expected to be convened by the local&#13;
building official and will include the distribution of the public information&#13;
handouts&#13;
29.   Procurement Requirements: A public relations specialist would be engaged to work in&#13;
conjunction with the technical advisor to the building control unit to develop a structured&#13;
program which brings the introduction of the Code to public notice. This work should be&#13;
implemented within the first year of the program so as to ensure public awareness of the&#13;
introduction of the new Code and the responsibilities within it. This phase of work is expected to&#13;
extend over 2 months.&#13;
B.3.4 Guidelines on Retrofitting of Existing Houses&#13;
30.   Scope: Development of guidelines describing how to retrofit existing houses to improve&#13;
their resistance to natural hazards such as cyclone and earthquake attack.&#13;
31.   Issues:&#13;
(i)  With the successful implementation of the new Code, buildings of the future will&#13;
be assured of attaining a reasonable level of safety to safeguard against collapse&#13;
during both cyclonic wind storms or under severe earthquakes. However the&#13;
resistance of the current building stock to such events is highly doubtful. Yet&#13;
much of this stock will continue to be used for the next 20 to 50 years.&#13;
(ii)  Providing a degree of assured resistance to rare, extreme events is possible in&#13;
many cases and generally at costs which are a small fraction of the reinstatement&#13;
cost of those buildings once they have been damaged.&#13;
(iii)  While retrofitting of existing buildings often does not attain the same level of&#13;
resistance as can be expected from a new building, it has been found to be&#13;
economically feasible to retrofit buildings to obtain a moderate degree of assured&#13;
resistance against severe wind or earthquake attack.&#13;
32.   Implementation Strategy:&#13;
(i)  Home owners or occupants who intend to renovate or restore buildings to a higher&#13;
level of wind or earthquake resistance would give notice of this intent to the&#13;
building control unit. A representative from the unit would, in consultation with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -                            Appendix 2&#13;
the owner or their building advisor, determine a suitable course of action&#13;
appropriate for the specific building being considered. (Note there will be&#13;
instances where the current state or condition of the building or its particular plan&#13;
layout is not appropriate for retrofitting and such actions are not to be&#13;
recommended.) Once the retrofit strategy is agreed, a details of the retrofit&#13;
procedures would be developed. Upon completion a final inspection would be&#13;
required to verify the repairs have been completed as specified.&#13;
(ii)  Guidelines would be prepared outlining the principles of both cyclone and&#13;
earthquake resistant house design. The guidelines would include a set of common&#13;
retrofit measures which can be employed for different types of houses.&#13;
33.    Procurement Requirements: A structural engineering specialist would be engaged to&#13;
prepare suitable guidelines for assessing retrofit techniques for typical housing systems. This&#13;
work should be implemented with urgency if the schedule for enactment of the Code is to be&#13;
met. The work is expected to extend over 2 months.&#13;

KINGDOM OF TONGA&#13;
CYCLONE EMERGENCY RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT (CERMP)&#13;
EMERGENCY AND RISK MANAGEMENT COMPONENT&#13;
Background on the Existing ERM approach and structure&#13;
1 .   TC Waka severely tested the disaster response capability of the Tongan authorities as no&#13;
emergency has done since TC Isaac 20 years ago in 1982, or since the magnitude 7.2 earthquake,&#13;
25 years ago in 1977. It destroyed or seriously damaged a minimum of 20%, and perhaps as&#13;
much as 35%, of the housing stock in the Vava'u Division, as well as seriously affecting the&#13;
Niuas Division.&#13;
2.    Although, coincidentally, moves were already underway to legislate for building codes in&#13;
Tonga, TC Waka served to underline the generally poor quality of buildings in Tonga and the&#13;
lack of awareness, and control, of building standards.&#13;
3.    The existing disaster management mechanism of Tonga was found to be slow in&#13;
responding (lack of resources and an inadequate authority structure were cited amongst other&#13;
reasons), to the extent that the function was subsumed under a special body set up for the&#13;
disaster.&#13;
4.    TC Waka was a typical of the infrequent, fast-onset hazards common across the Pacific&#13;
region - the recurrence interval of these hazards for each particular country is generally long&#13;
enough so that preparedness tends to deteriorate between events, but short enough so that several&#13;
such impacts might be felt within the useful lifetime of a given building. The impacts of disasters&#13;
of this size are guaranteed to cause a shock to the struggling national economies of Pacific Island&#13;
Countries.&#13;
Appraisal of TC Waka damage by SOPAC&#13;
5.    The South Pacific Geoscience Commission (SOPAC carried out an appraisal of damage&#13;
on Vava'u island in order to analyse the effect of TC Waka on typical Tongan building stock,&#13;
and to use the resulting model to predict damage from future cyclones (see details description of&#13;
appraisal in Appendix ). The appraisal logged 685 buildings and assessed the degree of damage.&#13;
Of the 685 structures, 43% suffered only light damage while the remainder lost at least part of&#13;
their roof or worse. Although the survey was not exhaustive and did not identify every damaged&#13;
building on the mainland of Vava'u, it provided a very large sample. 82% of the buildings were&#13;
classified as households, while the remaining 18% were distributed over12 other classifications,&#13;
as shown in Table 1. Of the 685 damaged buildings inspected and logged, 274 buildings (or&#13;
40%) had a floor area of less than 50 m . Of these small buildings, 152 (or 55%) had suffered&#13;
significant damage (CDV &gt; 0. 0) during TC Waka.&#13;

6.     While undertaking this survey, SOPAC observed that the rigid coordinates of the country&#13;
maps are conflicting with the World Geodetic System as established by precision geographic&#13;
positioning system (GPS) reference points. New maps and map products are needed to reconcile&#13;
this conflict.&#13;
7.     The inter-relationship between the Central Damage Value and wind loading class&#13;
indicates that all of the total collapses occurred in the lowest wind loading Class D, and that only&#13;
light damage occurred in Class A buildings, as might be expected. The greatest losses were&#13;
among the Class C wooden bungalows where 272 (or 40% of the total) of the buildings suffered&#13;
significant damage.&#13;
Current situation in Tonga and basis for recommending changes&#13;
8.     Despite the ongoing and recently completed projects, Tonga still remains at some&#13;
distance from achieving the objective of an integrated and effective national risk management&#13;
system. Because of the infrequency of large natural disasters, NDMO offices in the Pacific&#13;
region are rarely afforded the status, authority or resources for operation or training to be able to&#13;
effectively handle a quick-onset disaster. Depending on the point of view, this might be&#13;
considered as under-resourcing, or alternatively, might reflect realistic risk-prioritisation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -                            Appendix 3&#13;
risk-acceptance, and may or may not be viewed as a valid approach given the limited means&#13;
available within Tonga. Following the risk management process through would more clearly&#13;
define the issues and assist the Government to prioritise the provision of capability to the NDMO&#13;
to respond to disasters.&#13;
Current hazard and risk mitigation environment in Tonga&#13;
9.    There are several activities relating to disaster and risk mitigation currently underway in&#13;
Tonga. Activities under the CERM Project would complement and perhaps augment these&#13;
parallel activities.&#13;
10.   The SOPAC Pacific Cities program was initiated in 1996 in five of the highest risk&#13;
capitals of the Pacific, including Nuku'alofa, and is currently active. The program is&#13;
concentrated specifically in the cities of the Pacific, based on the need to bring about the greatest&#13;
benefit for the most people. The methodologies established by that program 6 years ago are&#13;
fundamental to the type of solutions being proposed in the CERMP, albeit on a wider&#13;
geographical basis. The World Bank successfully demonstrated the success of scaling up such a&#13;
concept in the recent coastal hazards project in Samoa.&#13;
11.   Pacific Cities uses a risk-GIS (Geographic Information System) approach to facilitate a&#13;
quantitative assessment of risk in Tonga - the impact and frequency of hazards on the populace,&#13;
infrastructure and economy. The program is based on establishing a database which not only&#13;
brings up-to-date all of the existing information related to risk management, but also becomes&#13;
the foundation for accumulating information from that day onward. The concept of keeping&#13;
records, which is critical to taking past lessons on disasters forward into the future, has been&#13;
greatly underplayed in the past in Tonga. Moreover, the database that is established is geo-&#13;
referenced, giving each record a three-dimensional location on a common, world-wide reference&#13;
system. The advantages of this are two-fold: it then becomes possible to interact between&#13;
databases from different areas with queries (for example, how many people live in the area of&#13;
highest potential cyclonic wind speed?), and by using the world-wide satellite GPS, it becomes a&#13;
simple matter to relocate on a given reference point and check or add information to the&#13;
database. The benefit of such a system is that information accumulates in the one place and is not&#13;
lost to the system, is easily stored, readily accessible, and readily compared with other&#13;
information at the same and different locations, and easily manipulated to provide answers to&#13;
pressing problems.&#13;
12.   The SOPAC Disaster Management Unit (DMU) Project addresses the wider problem of&#13;
instituting a system of risk management in Tonga on a national basis. It is two-thirds completed&#13;
for the current three-year cycle with an application for extension into a second cycle currently&#13;
underway. The objective of the DMU is to reduce the compound risks of natural, human&#13;
induced, technological and environmental hazards through risk management; and to encourage&#13;
the development of an efficient response and recovery process.&#13;
13.    The DMU project is working, through the guidelines of the Australia and New Zealand&#13;
Standard on Risk Management (AS/NZS Standard 4630), to implement a comprehensive hazard&#13;
and risk management system (CHARM) in its member countries. Recently, the project has&#13;
concentrated its resources on four countries, which include Tonga. The DMU project aims to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -                            Appendix 3&#13;
institute a national risk management culture at all levels, across all arms of Government and all&#13;
concerned communities in Tonga. The DMU program currently underway is focussed on closing&#13;
the performance gap in 6 discrete areas:&#13;
* National Disaster/Risk Management Legislation, Policy and Planning Arrangements&#13;
* Capacity of the National Disaster Management Office&#13;
* Public Awareness&#13;
* Professional Development&#13;
* Comprehensive Hazard and Risk Management (CHARM)&#13;
* Risk Reduction Support Programs and Systems&#13;
An important part of this process has been supporting and bolstering the development of the&#13;
National Disaster Management Office (NDMO). This task has been approached, within the&#13;
implied limits set by the Government, based on the status, authority and resources which are&#13;
allocated to the NDMO.&#13;
Component objective and scope&#13;
14.   The objectives proposed for the CERMP component are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Strengthened community resilience to natural disasters in Tonga&#13;
(b)   Increased capacity for national emergency and risk management and effective&#13;
response to future disasters&#13;
Description of the components and sub-components&#13;
15.   It is proposed that the component would focus on three outputs, i.e.:&#13;
(i)   Improved institutional framework and operational procedures for emergency and&#13;
risk management;&#13;
(ii)  Reduction of the risks of damage from natural hazards, through development and&#13;
implementation of a national risk mitigation strategy; and&#13;
(iii)  Establishment of a land and spatial information system to support emergency and&#13;
risk management and other national information needs.&#13;
Implementation plan&#13;
16.   The approach should follow the general principles of risk management as set out in the&#13;
Australia and New Zealand Standard on Risk Management (AS/NZS Standard 4630), i.e.:&#13;
Establish the context, identify, analyse and evaluate the risks, and with appropriate raising of&#13;
community awareness, set out to treat the risks with appropriate monitoring, and review the&#13;
procedures in place. A series of ten output activities have been identified to be implemented&#13;
under this component, as follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Output   2   National risk mitigation strategy revised&#13;
Output   3   Effective national emergency and risk management system implemented&#13;
Output   4   National spatial geo-referencing system established&#13;
Output   5   Potential effects of major hazards assessed&#13;

Output   7   Building code implementation revised&#13;
Output   8   Community awareness raised&#13;
Output   9   Risk reduction plans prepared and implemented&#13;
Output   10 Progress monitored and reviewed&#13;
Output 1 addresses the immediate needs arising from the emergency of TC Waka. This event is&#13;
the stimulus for the project. Directly confronting the issues thrown up by Waka will help define a&#13;
framework for further action.&#13;
Output 2 sets the context of the problem facing Tonga. Here, assistance is provided to see the&#13;
national risk management strategy, already in the process of development, worked through to&#13;
finality. Output 3 puts the disaster management framework firmly in place to carry through the&#13;
risk strategy.&#13;
Before the risks to Tonga can be assessed and dealt with, the physical framework of a spatial&#13;
land management and reference system, Output 4, which includes geodetic surveying, aerial&#13;
photography and digital elevation models, must first be realised. On this basis, Output 5, the&#13;
development of a risk-GIS database and numerical modelling of hazards to identify frequencies&#13;
and impacts can then be achieved and the risks identified and analysed.&#13;
Evaluation of risk to the communities of Tonga (Output 6) can be realised only after the&#13;
quantitative effects of hazard impacts are analysed together with the elements at risk including&#13;
people, buildings, infrastructure and economy, and consultation is undertaken with the&#13;
communities of Tonga to identify treatment options.&#13;
Implementation of the building code provisions (Output 7) will be an important step in treating&#13;
and reducing the risk facing Tonga, while the preparation and implementation of risk reduction&#13;
plans at a divisional and district level (Output 9) will provide specific treatments for problems&#13;
identified in Output 6.&#13;
Output 8, community awareness is achieved through a variety of direct and indirect means as&#13;
the project progress, while regular monitoring and review of the project components will provide&#13;
continual feedback to the direction of the project (Output 10).&#13;
Implementation arrangements&#13;
17.   In order to keep the physical activity to a manageable size, some restrictions are&#13;
recommended on the area to be surveyed, photographed and modelled. The five administrative&#13;
Divisions are represented as well as the next five islands by population size as shown in Table 3.&#13;

CYCLONE EMERGENCY RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT (CERMP)&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
1.    The assessment of the Financial Management Specialist indicates the need to strengthen&#13;
the financial management system of the various implementing agencies, which could not be&#13;
addressed because of the emergency nature of this project. However, there is an on-going&#13;
Australian Aid-funded program for computerization of the accounting systems of the Ministries&#13;
of Finance and Health, and the Government has recently negotiated financial assistance from&#13;
ADB for the Economic and Public Sector Reform Program (EPSRP), with the objectives of&#13;
ensuring overall macroeconomic stability and enhancing private sector-led economic growth.&#13;
Among several advisory services and support for capacity building, the assistance addresses&#13;
financial management issues that are relevant to the World Bank's project, i.e., good governance&#13;
practices and strengthening the planning, monitoring and reporting capability of the ministries.&#13;
Any future involvement of the World Bank in this area would require a broader and an in-depth&#13;
review of the various on-going programs for strengthening of the financial management and&#13;
accounting systems in the country in order to be consistent with existing assistance.&#13;
Financial Management Arrangements&#13;
2.    A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be responsible for daily management,&#13;
monitoring and coordination of tasks under the Project. They will report progress on project&#13;
implementation on a monthly basis. The PMU will be supported by staff of the MOF, MOW and&#13;
MLSNR, and will be appointed on a full-time basis to monitor and supervise progress under the&#13;
project.&#13;
3.    The PMU, comprising a Project manager/procurement officer, finance officer/Project&#13;
accountant, and an administrative assistant will be located at the office of the Ministry of&#13;
Finance, which is responsible for coordinating the donor funds, as well as the Government&#13;
borrowings from various international agencies, i.e., EU, ADB and the World Bank. The PMU&#13;
will be directly responsible to the Project Coordination Committee, consisting of representatives&#13;
from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Works, the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Natural&#13;
Resources, Central Planning, the National Disaster Management Office and the Vava'u Disaster&#13;
Management Committee. The Project Coordination Committee will be established under the&#13;
Ministry of Finance.&#13;
4.    The Government has agreed to install an integrated financial management information&#13;
and accounting system that can generate the reporting information required to meet both&#13;
international accounting standards (IAS) and World Bank requirements. The FMS evaluated the&#13;
proposed system and confirmed that it meets the Bank's minimum requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -                            Appendix 5&#13;
Project Accounting&#13;
5.    The Chart of Accounts for the project will comply with the International Accounting&#13;
Standards (IAS) for proper project financial management, to enable its system to show cost&#13;
categories or commitments by contract. The Chart of Accounts will conform to the classification&#13;
sources of funds and expenditures, as detailed in the project documents (Operational Manual and&#13;
Memorandum and Recommendation and Technical Annex Documents). The PMU will be in&#13;
charge of project financial management, including accounting functions and reporting activities,&#13;
and will utilize its current computerized accounting system that will suit the project's&#13;
components. The system will facilitate reporting of financial transactions and enable the&#13;
Accountant to maintain accounting records, including receipt and disbursement of funds and&#13;
commitments and accruals, in a timely manner. Some of the basic accounting records included&#13;
in the computerized accounting system are the cash journal, bill register, contractors/consultants&#13;
ledger, etc. The availability of data from the computerized accounting system will help the PMU&#13;
focus on meeting project management information needs. And internal control system will be&#13;
built into the system to clearly define and document the accounting methodology to be followed&#13;
for recording individual project related transactions.&#13;
6.    All government accounts are maintained uniformly on a cash basis. For the Special&#13;
Account, the chart of accounts will be modified to comply with the International Accounting&#13;
Standards (IAS) for proper project financial management, to enable its system to show cost&#13;
categories or commitments by contract. The PMU will use accrual accounting. The financial&#13;
statements will be subject to external audits, which are to be carried out by the private local&#13;
auditors.&#13;
Staffing and Training&#13;
7.    The coordinating team will have two key staff, the Project Manager/Procurement&#13;
Specialist and the Finance Officer/IT staff.&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
8.    A Project Operational Manual (POM) will be developed for the Project; the Financial&#13;
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) would be developed to suit the Project and produced within three&#13;
months after the Project has been declared effective. The POM encompasses all levels of project&#13;
financial management, procurement and administration It includes accounting system and&#13;
internal control mechanisms including information flow and flow of documents, chart of&#13;
accounts, organization and staffing for both operations and financial management functions,&#13;
procurement procedures, procedures for cash and asset management, budgeting, accounting and&#13;
auditing policies and procedures used for the project, auditing arrangements, and terms of&#13;
reference of auditors.&#13;
Internal Controls&#13;
9.    The internal control starts with clearly written administrative, accounting and operational&#13;
procedures that define levels of authority and responsibilities, ensure an orderly and efficient&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

procurement and payment process, and properly record and safeguard project related assets and&#13;
resources. Specifically, this includes:&#13;
* a budgeting system with regular monitoring of financial performance;&#13;
* a process to identify and track sources of project financing, including the flow of funds&#13;
and&#13;
* the timing of such flows (whether direct to the project or through government entities);&#13;
* a suitable authorization process for award of contracts and purchase of equipment and&#13;
* supplies, including documentation procedures, which are in compliance with IDA&#13;
policies;&#13;
* an appropriate segregation of duties and responsibilities, including invoice processing,&#13;
* accounting duties and payment functions;&#13;
* the design and use of standard forms for recording and controlling financial transactions;&#13;
* a manual of accounting policies and procedures, which addresses all aspects of financial&#13;
* management, including staffing arrangements and responsibilities, the flow of funds and&#13;
funds management, internal control procedures, the accounting system and software used,&#13;
reporting formats and procedures, and storage of financial documents; and&#13;
* arrangements for storing projects documents and restricting access to authorized&#13;
personnel only.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
10.   The Borrower will open and maintain a Special Account (SA) at the National Reserve&#13;
Bank of Tonga, which is capable of providing efficient payment and clearing facilities. IDA&#13;
would, upon request, make an authorized allocation of US$585,000. Initially, the allocation&#13;
would be limited to US$200,000, until disbursements have reached SDR2.0 million, at which&#13;
time the full authorized allocation could be claimed. The SA will be maintained by the&#13;
coordinating team. These amounts would be used only for the purposes of the project to cover&#13;
its project expenditures. Disbursements under the credit will be made on a transactional basis,&#13;
using SOEs, for (a) grants, (b) goods, (c) contracts for the employment of consulting firms&#13;
costing less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract, (d) contracts for the employment of&#13;
individual consultants costing less than $50,000 equivalent per contract; (e) training and&#13;
workshops, and (f) incremental operating costs. In addition, the Borrower will open a Local&#13;
Project Account in the Central Bank, for depositing the GOT's counterpart financing&#13;
contributions for the project&#13;
Supporting documents will be maintained by the coordinating team, and made available to the&#13;
IDA's visiting missions and auditors as required. The coordinating team will also prepare and&#13;
provide to IDA its quarterly reports on implementation progress along with FMRs in formats&#13;
agreed with the IDA. The Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) will be used for monitoring&#13;
purposes. These arrangements are discussed in detail in Appendix 6.&#13;
11.   Financial Reporting. The PMU will coordinate the project activities; it would be&#13;
responsible for consolidating and processing all reimbursement claims, as well as the submission&#13;
of quarterly FMRs. The Accountant would be responsible for producing a full array of financial&#13;
statements and reports, including sources and uses of funds, balance sheets and cashflow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39 -                             Appendix 5&#13;
statements. In addition, a full set of quarterly FMRs, as listed below, using accrual model will be&#13;
generated from the computerized accounting system for the quarter beginning December 2002,&#13;
and will be submitted to IDA quarterly.&#13;
*  Sources and application of funds (by components and expenditures categories) and key&#13;
*  physical parameters and unit rates for selected key items;&#13;
*  Expenditures by disbursement categories (Goods and Works, Consultant's Services); and&#13;
*  Procurement process monitoring (Goods and Works; Consultant's Services). The&#13;
formats of&#13;
* these reports would be agreed upon with IDA and would be incorporated in the OM.&#13;
12.   Quarterly FMRs should correspond with the annual financial statements that will be&#13;
audited and submitted to IDA. In addition, monthly bank reconciliation statements for the&#13;
Special Accounts would be prepared.&#13;
Audit&#13;
13.   Project accounts will be audited on a semi-annual and annual basis in accordance with&#13;
international auditing standards by an independent auditor acceptable to the IDA. The auditor's&#13;
report will be made available to the IDA within six months of the close of the fiscal year for the&#13;
annual audit and within 45 days of the closing of the books for the semi-annual audit, every&#13;
August 15 and February 15. The audits will include a separate opinion on the SOE and the&#13;
Special Account. The first audit (for the.financial year 2002) would include a review and&#13;
commentary on the adequacy of internal controls and a post-review of 2002's financial&#13;
statements. A qualified, independent external auditor, acceptable to the IDA, would be&#13;
appointed prior to project effectiveness. The costs of annual audits will be met from the proceeds&#13;
of the Credit.&#13;

CYCLONE EMERGENCY RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT (CERMP)&#13;
PROCUREMENT CAPACITY AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Procurement Capacity Assessment And Action Plan&#13;
1.    Summary ofprocurement capacity assessment. A Country Procurement Assessment&#13;
Review has never been conducted for this country so this assessment has considered the national&#13;
legal framework as well as the country procurement capacity. A World Bank procurement&#13;
accredited staff (PAS) carried out the assessment of the implementing agencies. The assessment&#13;
(available in the project files) was discussed and agreed with the implementing agencies. The&#13;
main findings are as follows.&#13;
2.    Overall capacity of the implementing agencies involved with procurement is weak and&#13;
the associated risks are in the high category. They have no prior World Bank procurement&#13;
experience, but some limited procurement capacity with other donor agencies (e.g., ADB,&#13;
AusAID and NZODA) was present within the Central Planning Department. Therefore, in order&#13;
to mitigate the risk and ensure timely procurement of civil works, a Project Manager/&#13;
Procurement Officer will be hired. He/she will have the overall responsibility for procurement&#13;
for the CERM Project. The PM will have several years experience with World Bank financed&#13;
projects. The PM will add capacity to the implementing agencies by conducting a procurement/&#13;
implementation workshop, and reviewing all procurement under the project. After negotiations,&#13;
but before the PM is appointed, several start-up procurement documents including TORs for&#13;
Project Management Unit (PMU) officers, the ICB bidding documents for basic housing civil&#13;
works and the hiring of supervision consultant, will be prepared by an individual consultant with&#13;
substantial Bank civil works procurement experience.&#13;
3.    There is no national procurement law 'per se' and no NCB is proposed under the Project,&#13;
therefore there is no risk of inconsistency of local procurement procedures with World Bank&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
Procurement Reporting Requirements&#13;
4.    Procurement reporting will be presented in the FMS, described in the Financial Annex,&#13;
produced and submitted to the Bank in the quarterly FMR. Reporting procedures will be&#13;
established in the Project Operating Manual (POM).&#13;
Risk Assessment and Prior Review Thresholds&#13;
5.    The risk assessment of procurement implementation for this Project is considered high&#13;
and in consideration of the mitigation measures cited above the thresholds were set accordingly.&#13;
The prior review thresholds are commiserate with the level of risk.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -                             Appendix 6&#13;
Procurement Guidelines&#13;
6.    The procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines on Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA credits (January 1995, Revised January&#13;
and August I 996, September 1997, and January 1999). Procurement of services will be done in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on Selection and Employment of Consultants by the&#13;
World Bank Borrowers (January 1997, Revised September 1997, and January 1999).&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
7.    The BarLk's standard bidding documents for goods and works, standard evaluation reports&#13;
and stadard request for proposals for consulting services will be used under the Project. A&#13;
model ouotation solicitation form and draft contract for civil works and goods will be provided&#13;
in the Ch'I` f-or procurement to be carried out through community works subprojects.&#13;
Advertisement&#13;
8.    A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in the United Nations&#13;
Development Business in April 2002, announcing all procurement of works on the basis of&#13;
internationai Competitive Bidding (ICB) and major consulting services to be procured under the&#13;
project. Specific Procurement Notices (SPNs) in Development Business will also be required for&#13;
all consulting assignments exceeding US$200,000 per contract. SPN will be published along&#13;
with the GPN for the basic housing civil works construction using modified ICB procedures, in&#13;
accordance with the provisions in paragraphs 2.63 and 2.64 of the Guidelines.&#13;
Impiementation Arrangements&#13;
9.    The government will establish a Project Coordination Committee (PCC), chaired by the&#13;
Secretary of Finance. The PCC is composed of representatives of Ministry of Works (MOW),&#13;
MLSNR, Central Planning, NDMO and VDMC. The PCC will be responsible for the overall&#13;
coordination of project implementation. A Project Management Unit (PMU) under the PCC will&#13;
be responsibte for the day-to-day management, monitoring and coordination of the project&#13;
act:vities. The PMU will be located within the Ministry of Finance, and comprise a Project&#13;
Manager/Procurement Officer, Finance Officer, Accountant and Administrative Assistant. There&#13;
are three implementing agencies - MOF, MOW and MLSNR - that will implement the&#13;
respective components under the project. Under the guidance of the PMU the implementing&#13;
agencies will be responsible for project procurement, including preparation of bidding&#13;
documents, evaluation and contract award, inspection and certification of completion of works,&#13;
and management of contracts. The PMU will be responsible for project accounting and financial&#13;
management in cooperation with the Treasury Department, Ministry of Finance.&#13;

Assessment Of Agency's Capacity To Implement Procurement&#13;
10.   The appraisal mission carried out a capacity assessment of 5 agencies in four ministries&#13;
(Reference Assessment Report on file). There is no national policy and/or procedure manual for&#13;
public procurement, therefore none of the ministries has a written policy for procurement and&#13;
only some of these agencies have recent experience in implementing projects financed either by&#13;
the World Bank, i.e. MOF in early 1990, or Asian Development Bank or both. In general, the&#13;
assessment of project implementation under these agencies reports ad hoc procurement&#13;
procedures and some significant delays. Based on the risk assessment and the findings of the&#13;
procurement capacity of the implementing agencies the thresholds for prior review and&#13;
supervision plan have been set accordingly and are presented in Table C. A consultant with&#13;
expertise in World Bank procurement procedures will be appointed to the PMU in part to&#13;
supervise the preparation and process of procurements under the Project by the line Ministries.&#13;
All agencies will need to be strengthened by immediate training in World Bank procurement and&#13;
reporting requirements and procedures. The PMU Project Manager will conduct a procurement&#13;
workshop for the implementing-agencies and provide continued support throughout the Project.&#13;
Procurement Methods&#13;
Procurement of Civil Works (US$4. 11 million approximately)&#13;
11.   International Competitive Bidding (ICB). One civil works contract for cyclone recovery&#13;
houses will follow the Modified ICB procedures per paragraphs 2.63 and 2.64 of the guidelines.&#13;
The total IDA financing is estimated at about US$3.33 million.&#13;
12.   Community-Based Works. A firm will be selected to supervise civil works subprojects&#13;
for subcomponent A.3: retrofitting of existing houses and enterprises, and to provide technical&#13;
advice for A.2: rehabilitation of community buildings. The community-based works are&#13;
budgeted at US$750,000 in aggregate for about 440 subprojects and the supervision services are&#13;
estimated at approximately US$30,000. The firm will be selected competitively based on&#13;
consultant qualifications. The selection criteria, supervision and monitoring responsibilities,&#13;
procurement procedures in accordance with the Bank Guidelines' national shopping procedures.&#13;
All grant payments for the works would be made directly by the PMU.&#13;
Procurement of goods (US$0.42 million approximately)&#13;
13.   ICB and/or Limited International Bidding (LIB). Procurement of goods, i.e. Aerial&#13;
Photography and Map Products, may be procured through LIB at an estimated cost of&#13;
US$400,000.&#13;
National Shopping (NS). Procurement of computer and office equipment, office furniture and&#13;
supplies for the PMU will be through National Shopping procedures using due diligence as&#13;
outlined in the Guidelines. The aggregate amount through national shopping procedures does&#13;
not exceed US$50,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -                            Appendix 6&#13;
Consulting services (US$1.68 million approximately)&#13;
15.   Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS). This method will be used for consulting&#13;
firms to assist in (i) strengthening emergency and risk management and (ii) civil works&#13;
supervision. Aggregate cost estimated about US$1.3 million.&#13;
16.   Quality Based Selection (QBS). A consulting firm to assist with improving building&#13;
standards and provide training for the building industry will be procured through QBS, with an&#13;
estimated cost of less than US$160,000.&#13;
17.   Consultant Qualifications (Co). Selection of a firm or NGO for the public information&#13;
and education program, and of an auditing firm, will be made using CQ methods, for contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent each.&#13;
18.   Single-Source Selection (SSS). Given the emergency nature of this project, the financial&#13;
management system for the project needs to be established before the main activities begin. An&#13;
international firm will be contracted to assist in setting up the financial management system and&#13;
to provide training to the staff in the PMU.&#13;
19.   Individual Consultants. An individual consultant for project management and&#13;
procurement, will be hired to head the PMU with the over all responsibility of coordination of&#13;
project implementation and strengthening the capacity of three project implementation agencies.&#13;
Another individual will be hired as Project Accountant with the overall responsibility to maintain&#13;
Project accounts. Selection of individual consultants will be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
provisions 5.1 through 5.3 of the Guidelines on Selection and Employment of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers.&#13;
Training and Workshops (TJS$0. 04 million approximately).&#13;
20.   Implementation of annual training programs including TORs, selection of trainees, and&#13;
venues will be subject to Bank's prior approval. Annual training work programs will be&#13;
submitted for Bank's approval.&#13;
Incremental Operating Costs (US$0. 06 million approximately).&#13;
21.   Incremental operating costs consist of audit services using consultant qualifications&#13;
selection method, communication expenses and postage, small office consumables, supervision&#13;
activity expenses, i.e., per diem and in-country travel. All will be availed of in accordance with&#13;
government administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Advance Procurement And Retroactive Financing&#13;
22.   Given the nature of the emergency rehabilitation project, selection of project management&#13;
and implementation personnel, bidding for civil works and request for quotations for additional&#13;
office equipment will need to be carried out immediately. All procurement activities, including&#13;
procurement of goods, works, and consulting services must comply with the Bank's procurement&#13;
&#13;

KINGDOM OF TONGA&#13;
CYCLONE EMERGENCY RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT (CERMP)&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The proposed Cyclone Emergency Recovery and Management project aims to assist the&#13;
Government of Tonga to respond to the damage caused by the Tropical Cyclone Waka through&#13;
measures aimed at replacement of social infrastructure, and risk management. The main civil&#13;
works component in the project consists of replacing damaged housing and community&#13;
buildings, as well as retrofitting residential and small enterprise structures.&#13;
2.    Since the project is an emergency recovery one, it has not required a full environmental&#13;
assessment (ref. OP 8.50). The IDA review of the project concept concluded that the project is&#13;
an environmental category B project which is not likely to have significant environmental&#13;
consequences. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take into account environmental and social issues&#13;
during the planning, design and implementation of project components to ensure that they meet&#13;
the Bank's environmental and social safeguard requirements.&#13;
Environmental issues&#13;
3.    The magnitude of adverse impacts is expected to be minor. Potentially negative&#13;
environmental issues are primarily associated with the replacement housing component, and the&#13;
retrofitting of residential and small enterprise structures. The types of environmental issues that&#13;
may arise relate to land clearing for site preparation, movement of workers, equipment, and&#13;
materials to and from project site, and proper disposal of debris. Given the small scale of works&#13;
in each location, these impacts are expected to be minimal. National guidelines for handling&#13;
environmental issues are contained in a Cabinet decision from 1987; an Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment bill is under review by government before submission to Parliament. The existing&#13;
guidelines do not appear to include any direct policy on EIA for housing.&#13;
4.    Compliance with environmental requirements of the Bank will be achieved through the&#13;
contractual arrangements with civil works contractors. Civil works contracts for housing&#13;
reconstruction works will include special technical provisions specifying good environmental&#13;
practices. The supervising consultants will be responsible for ensuring that environmental&#13;
requirements as contractually stipulated are followed.&#13;
Social issues&#13;
5.    The social impacts of the cyclone have been widespread, roughly 1,500 households or&#13;
under 50 per cent of the Vava'u population was affected by TC Waka. Approximately 500&#13;
households (about 19%), had their houses completely damaged. A rapid assessment of the&#13;
affected areas shows that the majority of those living in temporary shelters, or with neighbors&#13;
and relatives are from socio-economic groups least able to cope with loss of home and income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47 -                             Appendix 7&#13;
The affected households tend to be large in size, 6-8 household members, and are engaged&#13;
primarily in subsistence agriculture and fishing. Cash incomes are low and tentatively in the&#13;
range of TOP 1,200 to TOP 2,000 per year per household. Financial capacity to re-build homes&#13;
to cyclone resistant standards is therefore considered to be limited.&#13;
6.    It appears that women headed households are disproportionately represented in those&#13;
without housing (to be verified by the detailed survey); in some cases women whose houses were&#13;
not damaged by the cyclone have had to give up their house to a male relative who lost his&#13;
house. It is therefore anticipated that the replacement of housing under the project will have&#13;
positive social impacts.&#13;
7.    Participation: Civil society has been extensively consulted during the preparation of the&#13;
project. The project design has been presented to and reviewed by NGO representatives and&#13;
local church organizations; views and information were obtained from local tradesmen, builders,&#13;
and private commercial banks. Continued involvement of the beneficiaries is built into the&#13;
project implementation arrangements.&#13;
8.    The update of the damage assessment and eligibility list would be completed by a team&#13;
composed of the MOW, the town official, and the local Church minister. The update team will&#13;
also gather detailed household information which provides a baseline socio-economic status of&#13;
the affected households. The list of households selected for participation, based on agreed&#13;
eligibility criteria, in the project will be presented to and discussed with communities by a&#13;
representative from the Governor's office. The beneficiary lists will also be posted in community&#13;
halls, churches, schools, and the governor's office. Further, implementation of the community&#13;
buildings and retrofitting sub-components and the awareness campaign would be monitored by a&#13;
local NGO.&#13;
Dealing with potential land tenure issues&#13;
9.    Most of the activities under the project are restoration works and do not therefore require&#13;
any new land acquisition from local land owners, or alienation of land under different tenure&#13;
systems. Since no new land, which is being otherwise used by anyone for residence or&#13;
cultivation, would be acquired or alienated, there would be no clearance of squatters or&#13;
encroachers.&#13;
10.   Bank guidelines require that households establish ownership or usufruct to the land where&#13;
the houses will be rebuilt. According to the 1996 population census, 80 percent of households&#13;
own the houses they live in, about 13 percent have houses provided free of charge, and&#13;
approximately 6 percent rent or have other tenure arrangements. All land in the kingdom is the&#13;
property of the Crown. Hereditary estates are held by the nobles and matapules (estate&#13;
spokesmen) who can allot or lease land to landholders. Though all Tongan males are entitled to&#13;
land, as per the 1927 Land Act, in reality, continued sub-division of land is not possible and not&#13;
all Tongan males and households have such allotments. Due to the practice of land and estate&#13;
holders allowing occupancy and use of land through "words", that is, verbal commitments, there&#13;
may be some beneficiaries who lack documentation establishing the right to use of the land they&#13;
occupy. Women are more likely to be dis-franchised than men as hereditary land passes through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                             Appendix 7&#13;
sons; women can at best lease land or have a land "permit" for use of the land during their&#13;
lifetime.&#13;
11.   To ensure that land required for the project is legally available, and to ensure that current&#13;
occupants are not dispossessed of the houses provided under the project, all beneficiaries would&#13;
be required to produce one of the following documentary evidence establishing ownership or&#13;
usufruct:&#13;
* Deed of grant (registration)&#13;
* Deed of lease&#13;
* Certificate of apportionment (blue form) from the MLSNR&#13;
* letter from the land owner in favor of the current occupant, establishing continued&#13;
occupation of the land and replacement house. The letter can be either witnessed by a&#13;
third party or duly sworn affidavit before a Magistrate or Commissioner of Oaths.&#13;

steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.&#13;
II.D. la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any&#13;
potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.&#13;
Environmental&#13;
The magnitude of adverse environmental impacts is expected to be minor. Potentially negative environmental issues&#13;
are primarily associated with the replacement housing component, and the retrofitting of residential and small&#13;

environmental issues are contained in a Cabinet decision from 1987; an Environmental Impact Assessment bill is under&#13;
review by government before submission to Parliament. The existing guidelines do not appear to include any direct&#13;
policy on EIA for housing.&#13;
Social:&#13;
The social impacts of the cyclone have been widespread, roughly 1,500 households or under 50 per cent of the Vava'u&#13;
population was affected by TC Waka. Approximately 500 households (about 19%), had their houses completely&#13;
damaged. A rapid assessment of the affected areas shows that the majority of those living in temporary shelters, or&#13;
with neighbors and relatives are from socio-economic groups least able to cope with loss of home and income. The&#13;
affected households tend to be large in size, 6-11 household members, and are engaged primarily in subsistence&#13;
agriculture and fishing. Cash incomes are low and tentatively in the range of TOP 300 to TOP 2,000 per year per&#13;
household. Financial capacity to re-build homes to cyclone resistant standards is therefore considered to be extremely&#13;
limited. It appears that women headed households are disproportionately represented in those without housing (to be&#13;
verified by the detailed survey); in some cases women whose houses were not damaged by the cyclone have had to give&#13;
up their house to a male relative who lost his house. It is therefore anticipated that the replacement of housing under the&#13;
project will have strong positive social impacts.&#13;
Land:&#13;
The activities under the project are restoration works and do not therefore require any new land acquisition from local&#13;
land owners, or alienation of land under different tenure systems. Since no new land, which is being otherwise used by&#13;
anyone for residence or cultivation is expected to be acquired or alienated, there is no clearance of squatters or&#13;

passes through sons; women can at best lease land or have a land "permit" for use of the land during their lifetime.&#13;
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or due to&#13;
multiple project component.&#13;
Cumulative impacts due to secure weatherproof housing for these largely poor households are expected to be positive,&#13;
resulting in better managed village environment.&#13;

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues&#13;
Environmental&#13;
Compliance with environmental requirements of the Bank will be achieved through the contractual arrangements with&#13;
civil works contractors. Civil works contracts for housing reconstruction works will include special technical&#13;
provisions specifying good environmental practices. The supervising consultants will be responsible for ensuring that&#13;
environmental requirements as contractually stipulated are followed.&#13;
Social:&#13;
The update of the damage assessment and eligibility list would be completed by a team composed of the Ministry of&#13;
Works, the town official, and civil society representative, e.g., local Church minister. The update team will also gather&#13;
detailed household information which provides a baseline socio-economic status of the affected households. The list of&#13;
households selected for participation, based on agreed eligibility criteria, in the project will be presented to and&#13;
discussed with communities by a representative from the Governor's office. The beneficiary lists will also be posted in&#13;
community halls, churches, schools, and the governor's office. Implementation of the community buildings sub-&#13;
component will involve the local Vava'u Disaster Management Committee and local officials. For implementation of&#13;
the retrofitting subcomponent, an NGO will monitor and facilitate selection of the subprojects; civil works will be&#13;
completed by communities themselves with technical advise and supervision from a technical adviser under Ministry of&#13;
Works.&#13;
Land:&#13;
To ensure that land required for the project is legally available, and to ensure that current occupants are not&#13;
dispossessed of the houses provided under the project, all beneficiaries would be required to produce one of the&#13;
following documentary evidence establishing ownership or usufruct: (i) deed of grant (registration); (ii) deed of lease;&#13;
(iii) Certificate of Apportionment (blue form, from the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Natural Resources); (iv) letter&#13;
from the land owner in favor of the current occupant, including provisions to allow the affected household the use of&#13;
the house to be built under the same land tenure arrangements existing prior to the cyclone, and for a period of time of&#13;
not less than the economic life of the house to be built. The letter to be registered in the District Court of Vava'u.&#13;
At appraisal, it was determined that all the houses are to be replaced on the existing land, so land acquisition will not&#13;
be required. Accordingly, no Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) is required, consistent with the&#13;
decision of the safeguards review meeting on 4/4/02.&#13;
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies,&#13;
with an emphasis on potentially affected people.&#13;
Civil society has been extensively consulted during the preparation of the project. The project design has been&#13;
presented to and reviewed by NGO representatives and local church organizations; views and information were&#13;
obtained from local tradesmen, builders, and private commercial banks. Continued involvement of the beneficiaries is&#13;
built into the project implementation arrangements.&#13;
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of&#13;
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of&#13;
that policy apply.&#13;
[ ] S,. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in&#13;
management of one or more safeguard areas&#13;
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are technically and&#13;
institutionally manageable&#13;
[]S3. - No safeguard issues&#13;
[]SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar projects&#13;
which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard issues.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Cyclone
            Emergency Recovery and Management Project, are to assist the
            Government of Tonga in recovering the standard of living of
            its population affected by the cyclone, through the
            rehabilitation of the social infrastructure in selected
            damaged areas; and, in strengthening and upgrading its
            emergency, and risk management capacity, through the
            improvement of its nationwide resilience to natural hazards.
            Provision of shelter to the poor, and others made homeless,
            or affected by the cyclone, and, increased resilience to
            natural hazards of social infrastructure nationwide will be
            beneficial, in addition to better preparedness for future
            disaster management. Arrangements for procurement, financial
            management, and implementation address the fiduciary risks
            of the project.
