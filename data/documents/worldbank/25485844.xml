2     IDA MANAGEMENTâ&#128;&#153;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015&#13;
&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
This document should be read in conjunction with the International Development Associationâ&#128;&#153;s (IDA) financial&#13;
statements and managementâ&#128;&#153;s discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A) issued for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.&#13;
IDA undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Box 1 provides IDAâ&#128;&#153;s selected financial&#13;
data as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2015 (FY16 YTD) and September 30, 2014 (FY15&#13;
YTD) as well as for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
I.    Organizational Overview and Business Model&#13;
IDA is an international organization established in 1960 and is owned by its 173 member countries. It is the&#13;
largest multilateral channel for providing concessional financing and knowledge services to the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poorest&#13;
countries, and is one of the five institutions of the World Bank Group (WBG); the others are the International&#13;
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral&#13;
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes&#13;
(ICSID). Each of these organizations is legally and financially independent, with separate assets and liabilities.&#13;
IDA is not liable for their respective obligations. The WBGâ&#128;&#153;s two goals, to be achieved by 2030, are to end&#13;
extreme poverty by reducing the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 per day to no more than 3%&#13;
globally, and to promote shared prosperity in a sustainable manner by fostering income growth for the bottom&#13;
40% of the population in every developing country. In October 2015, the WBG raised its poverty line figure&#13;
upwards, from $1.25 to $1.90 a day, to reflect the increase in prices worldwide based on updated purchasing-&#13;
power-parity data.&#13;
IDA plays a pivotal role in the global aid architecture and pursues the WBG goals by providing concessional&#13;
development credits, grants and guarantees to the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poorest countries for programs and operations that&#13;
help meet their development needs. IDA provides technical assistance through reimbursable advisory services,&#13;
policy advice and global knowledge services through economic sector work and country studies. It also supports&#13;
member countries with disaster risk financing and insurance to help increase their financial resilience against&#13;
natural disasters, as part of their broader disaster risk management agenda. In addition, IDA provides or&#13;
facilitates financing through trust fund partnerships with bilateral and multilateral donors.&#13;
The resources available to IDA for funding its activities constitute its commitment authority. IDA finances its&#13;
development credit, grant and guarantee commitments primarily from partner contributions and loans, funds&#13;
from its internal resources, as well as transfers from IBRDâ&#128;&#153;s net income, and grants designated out of IFCâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
retained earnings. The three-year replenishment process allows IDA to be responsive to changes in the needs of&#13;
its borrowers and the development environment. Given that the disbursements of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s credits and grants take&#13;
place over several years, commitments do not have to be fully funded at the time of approval and this allows&#13;
partner contributions to be encashed over several years, and internal resources to be committed in advance of&#13;
their expected receipt.&#13;
Since its inception, IDAâ&#128;&#153;s resources have been replenished seventeen times, complemented by an additional&#13;
replenishment agreed to in 2006 for financing the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Details of the&#13;
Seventeenth Replenishment of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s Resources (IDA17), which is effective from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2017,&#13;
are provided in Chart 1.&#13;
&#13;
II.   Funding and Resource Allocation&#13;
The funding of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s lending, grant financing and guarantee activities is presented and discussed below.&#13;
Sources of Funds&#13;
Partner Resources (Subscriptions and Contributions and Borrowings from Partners): IDA finances its&#13;
commitments for development credits and development grants primarily through partner resources. The partner&#13;
resources that are in the form of subscriptions and contributions are assigned voting rights. Prior to IDA17, IDA&#13;
had not entered into long-term borrowings, even though it is allowed to do so under its Articles. Whilst grant&#13;
contributions from members remain at the core of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s financing framework, borrowings from partners were&#13;
introduced in IDA17 to increase the lending envelope available by incorporating a limited amount of debt&#13;
funding into the financing framework in a sustainable manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             IDA MANAGEMENTâ&#128;&#153;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015                  3&#13;
&amp;#12;Internal Resources: These primarily comprise contractual principal repayments (including any contractually&#13;
accelerated repayments and voluntary prepayments), interest income on blend term credits, income from the&#13;
investment portfolio and any carryover of residual resources from previous replenishments.&#13;
Transfers and Grants from affiliated organizations: These are transfers from IBRDâ&#128;&#153;s net income and grants&#13;
from IFCâ&#128;&#153;s retained earnings.&#13;
Applications of Funds&#13;
Disbursement of development credits and grants: Through its development operations IDAâ&#128;&#153;s development&#13;
credits, grants and guarantees benefit the poorest and least creditworthy countries, which are eligible to borrow&#13;
from IDA.&#13;
Administrative Expenses: IDAâ&#128;&#153;s policy is to maintain its service and commitment charges at a level that will&#13;
cover its administrative expenses. Commitment charges are set annually and take into account the extent to&#13;
which service and certain interest charges, and partner compensation for development grant financing and&#13;
forgone charges on development credits forgiven under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) and&#13;
the MDRI, cover administrative expenses. FY16 commitment charges are set at nil.&#13;
Commitment Authority&#13;
The IDA17 Commitment Authority Framework amounts to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 33.7 billion&#13;
(approximately U.S. dollar equivalent $50.8 billion using the IDA17 foreign exchange reference rate).&#13;
Chart 1 provides a breakdown of the principal sources making up the total lending envelope under IDA17 and&#13;
the extent to which these sources have been used for commitments of development credits, grants and guarantees&#13;
through September 30, 2015.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 a. Commitment Authority is measured and monitored in SDR. The chart represents the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts for&#13;
    presentational purposes only, based on the IDA17 foreign exchange reference rate of U.S. dollar/SDR 1.50718. Actual&#13;
    commitments are recorded based on historical U.S. dollar rates.&#13;
 b. Amounts may not add due to rounding.&#13;
 c. Includes U.S.dollar equivalent 4.5 billion of partner commitments for compensation of debt relief provided under MDRI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
III. Basis of Reporting&#13;
IDA prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United&#13;
States of America (U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the â&#128;&#156;reported basisâ&#128;&#157;. The financial statements&#13;
provide a basis upon which users are able to analyze IDAâ&#128;&#153;s sources and uses of resources. Under the reported&#13;
basis, IDAâ&#128;&#153;s Statement of Income alone does not reflect the true economic results of IDA due to a number of&#13;
asymmetries, which are explained in the MD&amp;A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;IV. Statement of Activities Analysis&#13;
The Statement of Activities (Table 1) is designed to reflect how IDA manages its sources and applications of&#13;
funds in executing its operating activities. Specifically, it presents the flows associated with IDAâ&#128;&#153;s operating&#13;
activities and the impact of these activities on the net asset value of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s investment portfolio. This&#13;
presentation addresses the majority of the asymmetries (explained in IDAâ&#128;&#153;s June 30, 2015 MD&amp;A) embedded in&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s reported basis results.&#13;

Results from Operating Activities&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s operating activities resulted in a net outflow of $764 million for FY16 YTD. This primarily reflects the&#13;
$2,358 million of outflows for disbursements of development credits and grants, partially offset by $528 million&#13;
of cash receipts relating to membersâ&#128;&#153; subscriptions and contributions and, $960 million of cash receipts relating&#13;
to principal repayments and prepayments.&#13;
The $981 million variance in FY16 YTD as compared to FY15 YTD is primarily due to the $1,000 million in&#13;
borrowings from partners received in FY15 YTD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                   IDA MANAGEMENTâ&#128;&#153;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015            5&#13;
&amp;#12;The following are additional details of the key drivers of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s results from operating activities:&#13;
Membersâ&#128;&#153; Subscriptions and Contributions&#13;
The subscriptions and contributions of $528 million represent the cash contributions received from members and&#13;
the encashment of demand notes. This excludes $60 million of member contributions received to finance&#13;
foregone charges for debt relief and development grant financing, which is reflected as part of administrative&#13;
activities.&#13;
Borrowings from Partners&#13;
There were no receipts from partner borrowings during FY16 YTD , as compared to $1,000 million which was&#13;
received over the same period in FY15 YTD. At September 30, 2015 borrowings from partners was $2,152&#13;
million as compared to $1,000 million as at September 30, 2015. (See Note D in the Financial Statements for&#13;
more details). The increase in FY16 YTD borrowing expenses is in line with the increase in borrowing balances&#13;
over the period.&#13;
Transfers and Grants from Affiliated Organizations&#13;
On October 9, 2015, IBRDâ&#128;&#153;s Board of Governors approved a transfer to IDA of $650 million, under IDA17.&#13;
This transfer was received on October 15, 2015.&#13;
Development Operations&#13;
Gross disbursements of development credits and grants&#13;
during FY16 YTD were $2,358 million, with Africa and&#13;
South Asia together accounting for 83%. The largest&#13;
declines in disbursements were in South Asia and Middle&#13;
East and North Africa which decreased by $125 million&#13;
and $40 million respectively, over the period.&#13;
&#13;
Of the $1,977 million in development credit disbursements,&#13;
33% related to commitments made under IDA17, 39%&#13;
under IDA16, and 28% related to commitments made&#13;
under earlier replenishments.&#13;
Of the $381 million in development grants disbursements,&#13;
30% related to commitments made under IDA17, 48%&#13;
                                                                       (a.Includes adjustments for certain PPA activity)&#13;
under IDA16, and 22% related to commitments made&#13;
under earlier replenishments.&#13;
In June 2015, the Board approved a Policy-based Guarantee for up to $400 million equivalent, to support the&#13;
issuance of up to $1.0 billion of long-term debt by a borrowing member country. This guarantee became&#13;
effective in October 2015. (See note F in the Financial Statements for more details). This was followed by an&#13;
approval by the Board in July 2015 for the same member country of an IDA payment guarantee for $500 million&#13;
in conjunction with an IBRD enclave loan guarantee of $200 million. This is the first time an IBRD enclave&#13;
instrument has been used in combination with an IDA instrument. It is structured to protect both investors and&#13;
lenders against debt service default of principal and interest. These gurantees are expected to attract significant&#13;
private sector participation in the project. They were not effective as of November [ ], 2015.&#13;
Table 2, shows a reconciliation of the results from operating activities as presented in Table 1, Statement of&#13;
Activities, to the reported basis, net income (loss). The reconciling items are presented as either (i) items in the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Development Credits Outstanding and Accumulated Provision for Debt Relief&#13;
and for Losses on Development Credits&#13;
Development credits outstanding increased by $253 million during FY16 YTD, primarily due to positive net&#13;
disbursements of $1,015 million offset by the $524 million MDRI write-off of credits pertaining to Chad&#13;
reaching completion point under the HIPC Debt Initiative, and by negative translation adjustments of $238&#13;
million resulting from the 0.2% depreciation of the SDR against the U.S. dollar. The majority of the decrease of&#13;
$443 million in the accumulated provision for debt relief and for losses on development credits reflects the&#13;
MDRI write-off. All eligible members of the HIPC Debt Initiative in accrual status have now reached their&#13;
completion point.&#13;
Investment Assets, net of related Liabilities&#13;
The net investment portfolio decreased from $28,418 million as of June 30, 2015 to $27,754 million as of&#13;
September 30, 2015, a decrease of $664 million. The main driver for the decrease was the net outflow of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
operating activities as reflected in the Statement of Activities (Table-1), as well as the $40 million negative&#13;
impact of exchange rate movements, reflecting the depreciation of the non U.S dollar component currencies of&#13;
the SDR against the U.S dollar. See Section IV for variance analysis of operating activities.&#13;
Subscriptions and Contributions&#13;
The $136 million decrease in subscriptions and contributions paid-in is primarily attributable to the negative&#13;
translation adjustment of $212 million which was partially offset by receipts from members of $39 million of&#13;
demand notes and $37 million of cash contributions.&#13;

8    IDA MANAGEMENTâ&#128;&#153;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015&#13;
&amp;#12;VI. Financial Risk&#13;
IDA is subject to four main types of financial risk: funding risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk.&#13;
Funding Risk is managed using the Commitment Authority Framework and monitored, in part, by the funding&#13;
position ratio, see Section II, Funding And Resource Allocation and Section VII, Funding and Liquidity&#13;
Positions.&#13;
Liquidity Risk is managed through a combination of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s daily cash flow monitoring and management, timing&#13;
of partner contributions, and prudent investment policies under an established financial framework. A key&#13;
indicator of liquidity management is the core liquidity position which reflects the number of months of gross&#13;
disbursements (based on the average for a particular year) that can be met out of the core liquidity (comprised of&#13;
investment portfolio tranches 2 and 3) available at any point in time, see Section VII, Funding and Liquidity&#13;
Positions.&#13;
Credit Risk includes two types: Country credit risk and Commercial credit risk.&#13;
Country credit risk is managed by the Development Finance Resource Mobilization Department, which regularly&#13;
reviews the credit risk of its recipient countries in terms of countryâ&#128;&#153;s debt sustaining capacity. These reviews&#13;
provide an input into the composition of development credits versus grants for new operations. Reviews are also&#13;
performed to determine the adequacy of provisions for losses on credits and other exposures.&#13;
Table 5 provides details of the top five borrowers with the largest development credits outstanding as of&#13;
September 30, 2015. These borrowers represented 50% of total development credits outstanding as of that date.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Commercial Credit Risk: The monitoring and managing of this risk is a continuous process due to the changing&#13;
market enviroment. IDA's commercial counterparty credit risk is concentrated in investments in debt instruments&#13;
issued by sovereign governments, agencies, corporate entities and banks, as shown in Table 6. The credit quality&#13;
of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s investment portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit spectrum, with 82% of the&#13;
portfolio rated AA or above, reflecting IDAâ&#128;&#153;s continued preference for highly rated securities and counterparties&#13;
across all categories of financial instruments. Total commercial counterparty credit exposure, net of collateral&#13;
held, was $31,139 million as of September 30, 2015.&#13;

                                   IDA MANAGEMENTâ&#128;&#153;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015                            9&#13;
&amp;#12;Market Risk: IDA faces foreign exchange risk with respect to its future partner contributions, which it manages&#13;
using currency forwards and by rebalancing the currency composition of its investment portfolio, and interest&#13;
rate risk on its investment portfolio, which is managed by aligning the duration of the investment portfolio with&#13;
that of the projected net cash requirements. The impact of these strategies is reflected on IDAâ&#128;&#153;s Statement of&#13;
Income, however, the economic offset is not reported as it relates to future net cash outflows. Further details can&#13;
be seen in IDAâ&#128;&#153;s June 30, 2015 MD&amp;A. The analysis below discusses the impact of these activities on IDAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Statement of Income and the corresponding economic offset.&#13;
Foreign Exchange Risk&#13;
IDA conducts its operations in SDR and its component currencies of U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen and pound&#13;
sterling. These constitute the functional currencies of IDA, and all other currencies are considered non-functional&#13;
currencies. Any translation adjustments due to exchange rate movements against the U.S. dollar for non-&#13;
functional currencies and functional currencies, are reflected in the Statement of Income, and in Accumulated&#13;
Other Comprehensive Income in the Equity section of the Balance Sheet, respectively.&#13;
IDA faces foreign exchange rate risk exposure as a result of the currency mismatch between its commitments for&#13;
development credits and grants, which are denominated in SDRs; partner contributions, which are typically&#13;
denominated in national currencies; and the portion of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s internal resources and expenditures that is&#13;
denominated in U.S. dollars and euro.&#13;
IDA uses currency forward contracts to convert the majority of partnersâ&#128;&#153; encashments provided in national&#13;
currencies into the four currencies of the SDR basket. These transactions are intermediated by IBRD for efficiency&#13;
purposes.The payable leg of the currency forward contracts economically hedging partner pledges are&#13;
denominated in non-functional currencies. Accordingly, appreciation (depreciation) of these currencies against&#13;
the U.S. dollar results in exchange rate losses (gains), which are reported in the Statement of Income.&#13;
The translation adjustment on future inflows from partners is the economic offset to the translation adjustment&#13;
on non-functional currencies of currency forward contracts. The translation adjustment gain on non-functional&#13;
currencies of $234 million in FY16 YTD was due to the depreciation of the non-functional currencies against&#13;
the U.S. dollar. This was offset by the effect of foreign exchange movements on the economic offset to the&#13;
currency forward contracts, i.e., the future inflows from partners, which was a loss of $278 million in FY16&#13;
YTD. In FY15, the translation adjustment gain on non-functional currencies of $389 million in FY15 YTD was&#13;
due to the depreciation of majority of the non-functional currencies against the U.S. dollar. This was offset by&#13;
the effect of foreign exchange movements on the economic offset to the currency forward contracts, which was a&#13;
loss of $479 million in FY15 YTD. The difference between the reported translation adjustments and the effect of&#13;
foreign exchange movements on the economic offsets, primarily represent the effect of foreign exchange&#13;
movements on the partner contributions in non-functional currencies that are not economically hedged through&#13;
forward contracts due to their relatively small contribution amount or the unpredictability of the expected&#13;
payment date. These residual partner contributions are hedged using a currency correlation methodology under&#13;
the overall currency management framework.&#13;
In addition, IDA also mitigates the currency exchange rate risk by aligning the currency composition of its liquid&#13;
asset portfolio and the hedges of its non-SDR cash flows with the SDR composition.&#13;
Interest Rate Risk&#13;
The primary objective in the management of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s investment portfolio is to provide a ready source of liquidity&#13;
when needed by IDA to meet projected net cash requirements. Accordingly, IDAâ&#128;&#153;s assets are invested so that&#13;
their duration closely matches the duration of these projected net cash requirements. Given IDAâ&#128;&#153;s lengthy&#13;
disbursement profile, the duration of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s investment portfolio is therefore relatively long. This long duration,&#13;
combined with volatility in market interest rates, results in significant year-on-year variability in unrealized&#13;
mark-to-market gains/losses on the portfolio. The economic offset to the unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses&#13;
on the investment portfolio would be the change in the present value of the projected net cash outflows.&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s investment portfolio had a duration of approximately three years as of September 30, 2015, and has two&#13;
components: core liquidity and partner asset and liability management. During FY16 YTD, the investment&#13;
portfolio experienced unrealized mark-to-market gains of $122 million as compared to unrealized mark-to-&#13;
market gains of $53 million in FY15 YTD, as a result of the more pronounced tightening of the yield curves for&#13;
the major currencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10   IDA MANAGEMENTâ&#128;&#153;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015&#13;
&amp;#12;The non-trading portfolios incurred unrealized mark-to-market gains of $7 million during FY16 YTD,&#13;
comprising of unrealized mark-to-market gains of $17 million on investments with IFC, partially offset by&#13;
unrealized mark-to-market losses of $10 million on the currency forward contracts. This is compared to&#13;
unrealized mark-to-market losses of $91 million in FY15 YTD, comprising unrealized mark-to-market losses of&#13;
$56 million on the currency forward contracts, resulting from the more pronounced downward movement of&#13;
yield curves of the majority of the payable currencies during FY15 YTD, and unrealized mark-to-market losses&#13;
of $35 million on investments with IFC.&#13;
&#13;
VII. Funding and Liquidity Positions&#13;
Management monitors IDAâ&#128;&#153;s funding and liquidity positions to assess IDAâ&#128;&#153;s ability to conduct its operations.&#13;
Since IDA has not borrowed from the capital markets, even though it is allowed to do so under its Articles of&#13;
Agreement, it is important that IDA has sufficient funding resources and liquidity to meet its contractual&#13;
obligations to disburse approved development credits and grants in a timely manner.&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s funding position is determined as the total of its investment portfolio and unrestricted demand notes as a&#13;
percentage of undisbursed commitments of development credits and development grants payable. Any remaining&#13;
funding gap will primarily be covered by future receipts of cash, demand notes already committed by partners,&#13;
and repayments on outstanding credits by recipient countries. At all times, IDA enters into new commitments&#13;
based on the commitment authority available. See Section II for further details on IDAâ&#128;&#153;s Commitment&#13;
Authority.&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s liquidity position is determined as the number of months of average gross disbursements covered by&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s core liquidity, comprised of investment portfolio tranches 2 and 3.&#13;
Funding Position                                           Liquidity Position&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As of September 30, 2015, the investment portfolio         As of September 30, 2015, IDAâ&#128;&#153;s liquidity position&#13;
and unrestricted demand notes covered 68% of all           was sufficient to cover approximately 9 months of&#13;
undisbursed commitments of development credits and         average monthly gross disbursements, within the 5&#13;
grants as compared to 70% at June 30, 2015. The 68%        year historical range of 9 to 14 months of average&#13;
funding position is slightly below the 5 year historical   monthly gross disbursements and above the minimum&#13;
range of 70% to 81%. This is due to the relative           requirement of 4 months. The liquidity position as of&#13;
reduction in the investment portfolio and unrestricted     September 30, 2014 of 7 months, was an outlier to&#13;
demand notes balance as result of the net outflows for     this historical range.&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s operating activities, being greater than the&#13;
relative reduction in the undisbursed commitments and&#13;
grants balance.&#13;
&#13;

                 IDA CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)                  17&#13;
&amp;#12;NOTES TO CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
NOTE Aâ&#128;&#148;SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
Basis of Preparation&#13;
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2015&#13;
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been&#13;
derived from the June 30, 2015 audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management, the&#13;
condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s financial&#13;
position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States&#13;
of America (U.S. GAAP).&#13;
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and&#13;
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the&#13;
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in&#13;
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have&#13;
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for debt relief and losses on development credits and other&#13;
exposures, and valuation of certain financial instruments carried at fair value. The results of operations for the first&#13;
three months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full&#13;
year.&#13;
Certain reclassifications of the prior yearâ&#128;&#153;s information have been made to conform with the current yearâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
presentation.&#13;
These financial statements were approved for issue on November [ ], 2015 which was also the date through which&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s management evaluated subsequent events.&#13;
Accounting and Reporting Developments&#13;
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act&#13;
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over&#13;
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various&#13;
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IDA continues to assess the impact&#13;
on its business. As of September 30, 2015, IDA believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its&#13;
business.&#13;
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of&#13;
the Effective Date. The ASU defers for one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with&#13;
Customers. As a result, for IDA, ASU 2014-09 will be effective beginning from the year ending June 30, 2020, with&#13;
earlier application permitted as of the quarter ending September 30, 2017.&#13;

&amp;#12;NOTE Câ&#128;&#148;INVESTMENTS&#13;
The investment securities held by IDA are designated as either trading or non-trading. These securities are carried&#13;
and reported at fair value, or at face value which approximates fair value.&#13;
During the year ended June 30, 2015, IDA purchased a security which is held in a non-trading portfolio. While IDA&#13;
does not plan to sell the security, IDA elected to measure it at fair value, so that all its investment securities would&#13;
be measured on the same basis. The changes in fair value for this security are reflected in the Condensed Statement&#13;
of Income. For details regarding this transaction, see Note G â&#128;&#147; Affiliated Organizations.&#13;
As of September 30, 2015, the majority of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s Investments comprised government and agency obligations (91%),&#13;
with all the instruments being classified as either Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.&#13;
A summary of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s Investments as of September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015, is as follows:Â &#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Valuation Methods and Assumptions&#13;
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of investments.&#13;
Investment securities&#13;
Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include&#13;
most government and agency securities and futures contracts.&#13;
For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined using model-based&#13;
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash&#13;
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and constant prepayment spreads.&#13;
Where applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default, and loss severity&#13;
are used.&#13;
Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are reported at face value, which approximates fair value, as they&#13;
are short term in nature.&#13;
Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and securities lent&#13;
under securities lending agreements&#13;
These securities are of a short term nature and are reported at face value, which approximates fair value.&#13;
Commercial Credit Risk&#13;
For the purpose of risk management, IDA is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve&#13;
elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible nonperformance&#13;
by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IDA limits trading to a list of&#13;
authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, credit limits have been established for counterparties by type of&#13;
instrument and maturity category.&#13;
Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through a credit approval process, volume limits, monitoring procedures&#13;
and the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements. IDA may require collateral in the form of cash or other&#13;
approved liquid securities from individual counterparties to mitigate its credit exposure.&#13;
IDA has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting provisions.&#13;
These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk with financial&#13;
assets subject to a master derivatives arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the extent that&#13;
payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a result of these&#13;
netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new transactions. The&#13;
extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of time following the&#13;
balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions, see note E-Derivative Instruments.&#13;

&amp;#12;The following is a summary of the collateral received by IDA in relation to swap transactions as of September 30,&#13;
2015 and June 30, 2015.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Securities Lending: IDA may engage in securities lending and repurchases, against adequate collateral, as well as&#13;
securities borrowing and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations, and ABS.&#13;
These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow IDA to&#13;
reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. As of September 30, 2015, amounts which could&#13;
potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master netting arrangements were $415 million ($457 million-&#13;
June 30, 2015).&#13;
Transfers of securities by IDA to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as IDA still retains control over these&#13;
securities and therefore the accounting criteria for the treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are&#13;
permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase date.&#13;
Securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements expose IDA to several risks, including counterparty risk,&#13;
reinvestment risk, and risk of a collateral gap (increase or decrease in the fair value of collateral pledged). IDA has&#13;
procedures in place to ensure that trading activity and balances under these agreements are below predefined&#13;
counterparty and maturity limits, and to actively monitor net counterparty exposure, after collateral, through daily&#13;
mark-to-market. Whenever the collateral pledged by IDA related to its borrowings under securities lending&#13;
agreements and repurchase agreements declines in value, the transaction is re-priced as appropriate by returning&#13;
cash or pledging additional collateral.&#13;

lending agreements, and the related liabilities:Â &#13;

Â &#13;
As of September 30, 2015, the liabilities relating to securities transferred under repurchase or securities lending&#13;
agreements included $575 million ($765 millionâ&#128;&#148;June 30, 2015) of repurchase agreement trades that had not&#13;
settled at that date. Of this amount, $354 million ($168 millionâ&#128;&#148;June 30, 2015) represented replacement trades&#13;
entered into in anticipation of maturing trades of a similar amount.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
In the case of resale agreements, IDA receives collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to repledge&#13;
these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the securities&#13;
received are not recorded on IDAâ&#128;&#153;s balance sheet as IDA has not obtained control over these securities and therefore&#13;
the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have not been met. As of September 30, 2015, securities purchased&#13;
under resale agreements included $396 million of securities which had not settled on that date ($181 millionâ&#128;&#148;June&#13;
30, 2015). For the remaining purchases, IDA received securities with a fair value of $281 million ($418 millionâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
June 30, 2015 million). Out of this amount, $27 million of these securities had been transferred under repurchase or&#13;
securities lending agreements ($81 millionâ&#128;&#148;June 30, 2015).&#13;
&#13;
NOTE Dâ&#128;&#148;BORROWINGS&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s borrowings comprise concessional partner loans. These borrowings are unsecured and unsubordinated fixed&#13;
rate debt in SDR component currencies. IDA may prepay some or the entire outstanding amounts without penalty.&#13;
These borrowings are carried and reported at amortized cost.&#13;
As of September 30, 2015, IDAâ&#128;&#153;s borrowings outstanding were $2,152 million. These borrowings have original&#13;
maturities of 25 and 40 years, with the final maturity being 2054. This does not include the effect of the amounts&#13;
relating to proceeds received under the grant component of the concessional partner loan agreements, for which&#13;
voting rights have been provided and are reflected in equity.&#13;

Offsetting assets and liabilities&#13;
IDA enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with&#13;
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IDA the&#13;
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in&#13;
the event of default by the counterparty.&#13;
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.&#13;
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.&#13;

adjustments) that are reflected on IDAâ&#128;&#153;s Condensed Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015.&#13;
Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of&#13;
legally enforceable master netting agreements. The net derivative asset positions have been further reduced by the&#13;
cash and securities collateral received.&#13;

Valuation Methods and Assumptions&#13;
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, TBA securities, swaptions, exchange traded options and&#13;
future contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps. These are valued using the standard discounted cash flow&#13;
methods using market observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates and basis spreads and funding&#13;
spreads.&#13;
&#13;
NOTE Fâ&#128;&#148;DEVELOPMENT CREDITS AND OTHER EXPOSURES&#13;
Development credits and other exposures are generally made directly to member countries of IDA. Other exposures&#13;
include irrevocable commitments, guarantees and repaying project preparation facilities.&#13;
Development credits are carried and reported at amortized cost. Of the total development credits outstanding as of&#13;
September 30, 2015, 90% were to the South Asia, Africa, and East Asia and Pacific regions combined.&#13;
Based on IDAâ&#128;&#153;s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of the development credits outstanding are in the&#13;
Medium and High risk classes.&#13;
As of September 30, 2015, development credits outstanding totaling $2,548 million (representing about 2% of the&#13;
portfolio) from five borrowers, were in nonaccrual status.Â &#13;

32 IDA CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)&#13;
&amp;#12;Credit Quality of Sovereign Development Credits&#13;
&#13;
Based on an evaluation of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s development credits, management has determined that IDA has one portfolio&#13;
segment â&#128;&#148; Sovereign Exposures. Development credits constitute the majority of sovereign exposures.&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowersâ&#128;&#153; ability and willingness to repay IDA on time and in&#13;
full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of&#13;
both quantitative and qualitative factors. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IDAâ&#128;&#153;s exposures,&#13;
exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the&#13;
likelihood of loss: Low, Medium and High risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status.&#13;
IDAâ&#128;&#153;s borrowersâ&#128;&#153; country risk ratings are key determinants in the provisions for development credit losses.&#13;
IDA considers a development credit to be past due when a borrower fails to make payment on any principal, service,&#13;
interest or other charges due to IDA, on the dates provided in the contractual development credit agreements.&#13;
The following tables provide an aging analysis of development credits outstanding as of September 30, 2015 and&#13;

Accumulated Provision for Losses on Development Credits, Debt Relief (HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI)&#13;
and Other Exposures&#13;
Provision for Losses on Development Credits and Other Exposures&#13;
Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provision for losses, which reflects the probable losses&#13;
inherent in IDAâ&#128;&#153;s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of losses arising from default and nonpayment of&#13;
principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Management reassesses the adequacy of the accumulated&#13;
provision and the reasonableness of the inputs used, on a periodic basis, at least annually, and adjustments are&#13;
recorded as a charge against or addition to revenue.&#13;

&amp;#12;Provision for Debt Relief&#13;
HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI provisions are based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of various factors,&#13;
including estimates of Decision Point and Completion Point dates. These factors are reviewed periodically as part of&#13;
the reassessment of the adequacy of the accumulated provision for debt relief. Provisions are released as qualifying&#13;
debt service becomes due and is forgiven under the HIPC Debt Initiative, and are reduced by the amount of the&#13;
eligible development credits written off when the country reaches Completion Point, and becomes eligible for&#13;
MDRI debt relief.&#13;
Changes to the accumulated provision for losses on development credits and other exposures, as well as the debt&#13;
relief under HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the fiscal year&#13;
ended June 30, 2015 are summarized below:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
During the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, no development credits were placed&#13;
into nonaccrual status.&#13;
During the three months ended September 30, 2015, service charge revenue recognized on development credits in&#13;
nonaccrual status was less than $1 million (less than $1 millionâ&#128;&#148;September 30, 2014).&#13;
Guarantees&#13;
Guarantees of $440 million were outstanding at September 30, 2015 ($411 millionâ&#128;&#148;June 30, 2015). This amount&#13;
represents the maximum potential undiscounted future payments that IDA could be required to make under these&#13;
guarantees, and is not included on the Condensed Balance Sheet. The guarantees issued by IDA have original&#13;
maturities ranging between 9 and 23 years, and expire in decreasing amounts through 2035.&#13;
As of September 30, 2015, liabilities related to IDAâ&#128;&#153;s obligations under guarantees of $36 million ($33 millionâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
June 30, 2015), have been included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These include the&#13;
accumulated provision for guarantee losses of $6 million ($6 millionâ&#128;&#148;June 30, 2015).&#13;
During the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, no guarantees provided by IDA were&#13;
called.&#13;
Subsequent event:&#13;
On October 14, 2015 a new financial guarantee issued by IDA became effective. The maximum potential&#13;
undiscounted future payments that IDA could be required to make under this guarantee is $400 million. The&#13;
guarantee has an original maturity of 15 years, and expires in 2030. Given that this guarantee became effective&#13;
subsequent to September 30, 2015, liabilities related to IDAâ&#128;&#153;s obligation under guarantees as of September 30, 2015,&#13;
do not reflect $46 million of amounts related to this guarantee, of which $10 million was charged to the statement of&#13;
income in the period this guarantee became effective.&#13;

&amp;#12;Segment Reporting&#13;
Based on an evaluation of its operations, Management has determined that IDA has only one reportable segment.&#13;
Charge revenue comprises service charges and interest charges on outstanding development credit balances and&#13;
guarantee fee revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, charge revenue from 2 countries of $52&#13;
million and $34 million, respectively, was in excess of ten percent of total charge revenue.&#13;

Retirement Plan and Trust, a Retired Staff Benefits Plan and Trust and a PEBP that cover substantially all of their&#13;
staff members.&#13;
While IDA is not a participating entity to these benefit plans, IDA shares in the costs and reimburses IBRD for its&#13;
proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD, as part of IBRDâ&#128;&#153;s allocation of staff and&#13;
associated administrative expenses to IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio.&#13;

plans totaled $57 million (three months ended September 30, 2014â&#128;&#148;$68 million).&#13;
The cost of any potential future liability arising from these plans would be shared by IBRD and IDA using the&#13;
applicable share ratio.&#13;
