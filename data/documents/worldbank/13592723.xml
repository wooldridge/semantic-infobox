to give advice and should consult with&#13;

Focus on the pragmatic. Without&#13;
being    insensitive   to   community&#13;
sentiments, it is important that&#13;
external support agencies help project&#13;
stakeholders focus on practical issues.&#13;
Sometimes, the ideal approach will&#13;
require such a comprehensive reform&#13;
it becomes unlikely to materialize,&#13;
e.g., the resolution of asset transfers.&#13;
Instead, support agencies and CBOs&#13;
might be more able to address some of&#13;
the "symptoms" of underlying problems&#13;

            The hard way to the high road : transition
            of community-based water groups to professional service
            providers in Indonesia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            As significant numbers of Indonesian
            villages are outside the reach of utility service, since the
            1990s the Government of Indonesia (Government) has been
            supporting the construction of village water infrastructure
            to be managed by users through community-based water
            organizations (CBOs). Emphasizing project ownership and
            democratic involvement, community-based management is
            thought to allow systems to be better maintained and
            operated post-project. Although community involvement in
            water supply has been going on through national projects in
            Indonesia for years, it was not until 2004, through the
            Water Resources Law, when the role of CBOs in water supply
            development was formally recognized. Before 2004, most
            policy pronouncements and official project documents
            considered CBOs to be a vehicle for project implementation
            rather than a long-standing approach to rural water
            development and management. The perhaps unexpected success
            of some CBOs is fomenting a discussion among policy-makers
            and project designers around whether CBOs might not
            transition from the original concept of a post-construction
            'coping mechanism' into a real engine for
            accelerating access to water in rural areas through a
            service-oriented enterprise of the community. Using the
            project inputs as genuine start-up capital, can CBOs create
            value? Is there sustainability after project? And if there
            is, what can be done to encourage more of it?
