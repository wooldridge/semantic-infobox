          SLOVAK REPUBLIC            - Enterprise   and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan&#13;

&#13;
                         Release of the Third Tranche -Full Compliance&#13;
&#13;
1.      The Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL) to the Slovak Republic (the&#13;
Borrower) was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on August 2, 2001, and became effective on&#13;
November 8, 2001. The EFSAL was designed to support the Government's enterprise and financial&#13;
sector reform program (the Program). The objectives of the Government's reform program in these two&#13;
sectors were to improve the stability and efficiency of the banlung system, to promote enterprise&#13;
restructuring through the workout of bad assets and improvements in the legal framework, to attract&#13;
foreign direct investment, and ultimately to facilitate the growth of output and employment in the longer&#13;
run.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The Loan of EUR 200 million was designed to be released in three tranches. The arrangements&#13;
for withdrawal of the Loan proceeds are described in the Loan Agreement, dated September 25, 2001.&#13;
The conditions for the release of the second and third tranches are described in Schedule 3 to the Loan&#13;
Agreement. The first tranche of EUR 58 million (of the EUR 60 million first tranche allocation, EUR 2&#13;
million was paid out upon effectiveness for the fiont-end fee in accordance with the Loan Agreement&#13;
stipulation) was made available to the Borrower upon Board presentation in August 2001, and was&#13;
disbursed on December 21, 2001. The second tranche, in the amount of EUR 70 million, on a full&#13;
compliance basis, was released on November 5,2003 and disbursed on November 10,2003.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The purpose of this memorandum is to inform the Board that all conditions for release of the&#13;
EUR 70 million third tranche of the Loan have been met, and that the Borrower is being informed&#13;
accordingly. In accordance with Section 2.02 (d) (11) of Article I1 of the Loan Agreement, discussions&#13;
were held with the Borrower and the National Bank of the Slovak Republic (NBS) in January and April&#13;
2004 to review the overall progress in implementing the Program and progress achieved in fulfilling the&#13;
conditions for release of the third tranche. This memorandum summarizes the results of the review and&#13;
concludes that the general macroeconomic conditions and the sixteen conditions for release of the third&#13;
tranche have been met.&#13;

&#13;
                         Release of the Third Tranche -Full Compliance&#13;
&#13;
 I.      BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
 1.      In the initial period after independence in early 1993, Slovakia achieved impressive&#13;
 economic results, and seemed poised to become a star performer among transition countries.&#13;
However, in the mid-1990s the country experienced severe internal and external imbalances, and&#13;
its economic performance deteriorated sharply under an isolationist and dirigiste Government.&#13;
During the period 1994-98 Slovakia privatized a large number of enterprises, but the&#13;
privatization program was fraught with problems, favoring politically connected parties and&#13;
practically excluding foreign investors. The pervasive presence of the State in the banking&#13;
system opened room for extensive political interference in lending decisions. The legal&#13;
framework for banking, enterprises and capital market activities remained weak, depriving&#13;
supervisors, creditors and small shareholders of essential rights. The outcome of these policies&#13;
was devastatingwith large enterprise losses, insolvency in the banking system, large contingent&#13;
fiscal liabilities, and the incapacity of the economy to generate growth and employment despite&#13;
large investment outlays.&#13;
&#13;
2.      A new reform minded Government came to power in September 1998 and immediately&#13;
announced its intention to undertake a comprehensive enterprise and financial sector reform&#13;
program to address the above referenced problems, and requested Bank support in the form of an&#13;
Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan. The Government's enterprise and financial&#13;
sector reform program comprised four components: (i) restructuring and privatization of the&#13;
banking system, centered on the privatization of the three large state banks, but also including&#13;
resolution of all troubled medium-sized banks; (ii) substantial strengthening of banking&#13;
regulation and supervision; (iii) implementation of a strategy to resolve the large stock of&#13;
problem loans taken off the books of the state banks; and (iv) improving the legal framework,&#13;
centered on the bankruptcy and collateralregime, and laws dealingwith corporategovernance.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Several other Bank activitieswere undertaken in conjunction with the EFSAL to provide&#13;
further support to the Government for implementation of the enterprise and financial sector&#13;
reform program, including (in that order) an IDF Grant for Bankruptcy Reform, an Accounting&#13;
&amp; Auditing Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), a Financial Sector&#13;
Assessment (FSAP), FSAP follow-up Technical Assistance for the creation of an integrated&#13;
financial sector regulatory and supervisory agency, an IDF Grant for Accounting &amp; Auditing&#13;
Reform, a Corporate Governance ROSC, a Corporate Governance Assessment of Private&#13;
Pension Funds, and a GDLN-based training program on private sector accounting &amp; auditing.&#13;
These activities were intended to deepen the understanding and buy-in of the reforms needed,&#13;
and to help build institutional capacityto implementnew laws and regulations.&#13;
&#13;
4.     During the initial period after Loan effectiveness, rapid progress was made with&#13;
implementation of the first two components (bank restructuring &amp; privatization and&#13;
strengtheningbank supervision). However, as a result of electionsheld in 2002 and also because&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 it took longer than expected to design more credit-oriented legislation, selected reforms&#13;
 supporting implementation of the last two components (bad loan workout and strengthening&#13;
 creditor rights) were noticeably slower to materialize. Therefore, release of the second tranche&#13;
 slipped from its original target date of early 2002 well into 2003. The new Government that&#13;
 came to power in the autumn of 2002 has proven to be even more reform minded than its&#13;
 predecessor,however, and was able to break through any remaining resistance to reform, and as&#13;
 a result the pace of reform implementation accelerated noticeably during late 2002 and early&#13;
 2003, also due to Slovakia's pending EU accession in May 2004. Consequently, the second&#13;
 tranche of the loan was released on November 5, 2003 and the conditions for the release of the&#13;
 third tranche were met as of April 21, 2004, ahead of Slovakia's EU accession on May 1, 2004&#13;
 and the original Loan closing date of end June 2004.&#13;
&#13;
 11.     RECENT ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
 5.      Slovakia has emerged as one of the leading reformers and fastest growing European&#13;
 Union accession countriesover the past two years. The Government elected for a second term in&#13;
 September2002 embarked on an ambitious program of enhancing macroeconomic stability and&#13;
accelerating structural reforms. The positive results are clearly emerging in terms of solid and&#13;
balanced growth and reduced macroeconomic imbalances. Nevertheless, high unemployment is&#13;
easing only slowly, and social instability and general dissatisfaction among voters appears to be&#13;
on the rise. This could slow the reform momentumgoing ahead.&#13;
&#13;
6.&#13;
direct investment and exports as well as robust domestic demand. The fiscal deficit has been&#13;
         Output is growing steadily at around 4 percent per year, supported by strong foreign&#13;
reduced from more than 7 percent of GDP in 2002 to less than 4 percent of GDP currently              -&#13;
against a backdrop of buoyant tax revenues and compression of expenditures, and the&#13;
Government's target of reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2006 looks feasible. This&#13;
would pave the way for Euro adoption in 2008-09. Meanwhile, the external current account&#13;
deficit has contracted sharply to a sustainable level, and core inflation remains low at around 3&#13;
percent (although consumer price inflation is significantly higher owing to large administered&#13;
price adjustments and increases in indirect taxes). Monetary policy continues to balance a fine&#13;
linebetween containing inflationarypressures and upward pressures on the currency arising from&#13;
the strong balance of payments. The only dark cloud on the horizon at this time is persistently&#13;
high unemployment,with only a weak response so far to the rapid output expansion.A large part&#13;
of this is structural in nature, reflecting skills mismatches, high social contribution rates, and a&#13;
benefit systemthat creates disincentivesto work.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Significantprogress has been made on structuralreforms in general and fiscal reforms in&#13;
particular. A comprehensivetax reform was implemented in the context of the 2004 budget, with&#13;
a loweringand harmonization of tax rates (including a flat income tax) and broadening of the tax&#13;
base. The pension system is also being reformed, with increases in and equalization of retirement&#13;
ages for men and women, a strengtheningof the link between contributionsand benefits, and the&#13;
introduction of a fully-funded pillar from 2005. At the same time, the social welfare system is&#13;
being overhauled. Health and educationreforms are also being introduced,but remain at an early&#13;
stage. Broad public sector reforms are needed to enhance efficiency and service delivery. In&#13;
parallel, measures are being implementedto stimulatelabor demand through reforms to the labor&#13;

&#13;
 111.    PROGRESS AGAINST THIRD TRANCHE RELEASE CRITERIA&#13;
&#13;
 LA, Section 2.02(d)(Io(A).&#13;
&#13;
      0  Progress achievedby the Borrower in the carrying out of the Program.&#13;
&#13;
 The Slovak authorities have completed the implementation of the Program, as evidenced by the&#13;
 successful restructuring and privatizationof the three large former state-owned banks, resolution&#13;
 through sale, closure or corrective action of all smaller problem banks, strengthening of bank&#13;
 supervision, and enactment of new, modem legislation in the areas of banking, insurance and&#13;
 securities markets, commercial law and secured lending. Additionally, satisfactoryprogress has&#13;
been made towards resolving public sector arrears and bad loans taken off the books of the state&#13;
banks, and preparationof new laws on bankruptcyand regulation of bankruptcytrustees.&#13;
&#13;
These reforms have contributed to higher economic growth, a reduction in unemployment and&#13;
&#13;
basis of which compliance with macro-economic targets and policies was to be judged at the&#13;
substantial foreign direct investment inflows. The IMF Staff Monitored Program (SMP), on the&#13;
time of third tranche release was completed in March 2002, and hence is no longer availableas a&#13;
reference. However, the IMF Article IVconsultation in August 2003 and staff visit in October&#13;
2003 confirmed that the current macro-economic framework is satisfactory. This assessment&#13;
remains valid as of now. On this basis, and also taking into account that all third tranche release&#13;
conditions specified in the Loan Agreement have been met, it is justified to release the third&#13;
tranche of the Loan.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
     0   Maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework, as measured on the&#13;
         basis of indicatorsagreed between the Borrower and the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The 2001 CAS for Slovakiadefined the macro-triggerfor disbursement of adjustment lending as&#13;
satisfactorymacroeconomic performance, including fiscal developments in line with medium-&#13;
term projections that envisaged a reduction in the primary deficit and containment of the debt-&#13;
GDP ratio. In particular, the fiscal deficit in 2001 was to be limited to the 2000 level, with a&#13;
further reduction of 0.5 percent of GDP per year in 2002-03. While there were some fiscal&#13;
slippages in 2001-02, with a shortfall in the targeted deficit reduction of about 1.5percent points&#13;
of GDP, the fiscalprogram was brought back on track in 2003 with an adjustment of 2.4 percent&#13;
points of GDP relative to the outcome for 2002. Major tax reforms aimed at lowering the tax&#13;
burden as well as expenditurereforms (focused on rationalizing the social securitysystem) were&#13;
introduced in the context of the 2004 budget. In addition to major reforms of the health care&#13;
system, a pension reform with the introduction of a second, fully-funded pillar is being&#13;
implemented. The Government targets a fiscal deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2004 and is on&#13;
track for meeting its objective of reducingthe deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2006.&#13;

Austria on July 4, 2003. A stake of 6.61 percent in the bank held by the formerly state-owned&#13;
Slovenska Sporitelna (Slovak Savings Bank) was transferred earlier into private hands through&#13;
the privatization of Slovenska Sporitelnaitself in 2001. Together,these two transactionsmeet the&#13;

    0   Enactment of amendmentsto the AccountingLaw, in substancesatisfactoryto the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
An amendment to the Accounting Law No. 431/2002 giving the Ministry of Finance the power&#13;
to set accounting standardsfor banks was enacted in the autumn of 2002. In November 2002, the&#13;
Ministry of Finance issued an implementing regulation (Measure 70/2002), effective January 1,&#13;
2003, containing the standards applicable to banks. These standardsare very close to IFRS and&#13;
as such satisfactory to the Bank. However, the regulation did not require reversal of accruals&#13;
already booked as interest income, resulting in income overstatement. Also, banks initially&#13;
interpreted the suspension requirement to be voluntary rather than mandatory. The Ministry of&#13;
Finance therefore amended the regulation effective July 1, 2003 to clarify that suspensions are&#13;
mandatory. Additionally, on March 12, 2004, the NBS disclosure rule for banks (NBS Decree&#13;
No. 5/2004) was amended to require banks, with effect of March 31,2004 to fully disclose non-&#13;
reversed interest income amounts in their published financial statements, so that financial&#13;
statement users can adjust income data and indicators based thereon. Further reforms to the&#13;
accounting standards setting process are envisaged to allow Slovakia to comply with the&#13;
requirements of the EU Acquis Communautairein this area, and are currently prepared by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance with assistance provided by the IDF Grant for Accounting &amp; Auditing&#13;
Reform.&#13;

&#13;
 A new audit law (No. 466/2002) enacted in June 2002 properly addresses the issues related to&#13;
 auditors'independence and ethics code. Article 28 (1) of the new law states that the Chamber of&#13;
 Auditors will publish a Code of Ethics in conformity with the Code of Ethics issued by the&#13;
 International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The Chamber of Auditors during its October&#13;
 2003 Annual Meeting formally issued the IFAC Ethics Code, and also mandated the use of&#13;
 International Standardson Auditingby all its members.&#13;

&#13;
As the core measure of its plan to strengthenthe finances of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF),&#13;
the Government prepared and Parliament enacted an amendment to the Deposit Insurance Act&#13;
(Law No. 118/1996)effective as of December 1, 2001 allowing the DIF to permanently raise&#13;
deposit insurance premiums collected from banks, and also extended the existing NBSMnistry&#13;
of Finance (MOF) majority on the DIF Board beyond Slovakia's EU accession. The resulting&#13;
increasein depositpremium income,coupled with steady growth in the banking system'sinsured&#13;
deposit base, has allowed the DIF to reduce its outstanding loan balance to the NBS from its&#13;
peak of around 16 Sk billion in late 2001 to 8.75 Sk billion (approximately US260 million&#13;
equivalent) as of April 20, 2004. The loan from the NBS is expected to be repaid by the DIF in&#13;
full by the end of 2005. Additionally, to clarify that any new NBS loans to the DIF in futurewill&#13;

&#13;
into a Memorandumof Understandingdated April 20,2004 and published on the MOF's website&#13;
on April 21, 2004 outlining this distribution of labor between the two institutions. Together,&#13;

&#13;
After the above referenced amendment to the Deposit Insurance Act (No. 118/1996) was&#13;
enacted, a working group was created comprisingrepresentatives of the NBS, the MOF and the&#13;
DIF to study the need for, and the feasibility of, a capital injection by the MOF in the DIF. The&#13;
working group concludedthat the DIF does not need a capital injection at this stage of Slovakia's&#13;
banking system development, given the dominanceof foreign bank ownership in the sector after&#13;
the completion of the bank restructuring and privatization program. Nevertheless, the working&#13;

group decided that the DIF should build up its capital base to healthy levels once it has&#13;

level for some time to come, using the rapid ongoing growth of the banking system's insured&#13;

The new corporateincome tax law (No. 595/2003) in effect as of January 1,2004has introduced&#13;
a favorable provisioning and debt write-off regime for non-bank claims falling due after 1-1-&#13;
2004. The new law does not contain any wording on the tax treatment of debt-equity swaps,&#13;
because legally such swaps are not yet possible under existing bankruptcy legislation. The new&#13;
draft bankruptcy law, submitted to the Legislative Council of the Government on April 15,2004&#13;
as a precedent condition specified in Para (1l), Section I1of Schedule 3 of the Loan Agreement,&#13;
formally introduces debt-equity swaps as a debt resolution mechanism, and the Government&#13;

Amendments were enacted during 2002 allowing more flexibility (including sale at a discount)&#13;
in the resolution of social security and health insurance premium arrears. However, insufficient&#13;

to public sector arrears resolution became apparent when selected resolution attempts were&#13;
undertaken (e.g., tax secrecy provisions in the previous corporate income tax law turned out to&#13;
preclude the transfer of tax arrears to third parties, and a 10percent of nominal value minimum&#13;
sales price to be received for sale of health insurance premium arrears at a discount resulted in&#13;
the failure of a tender offering such claims for sale, as all bids came in below this threshold).&#13;
Enactment of amendments to existing laws (Law No. 461/2003 on Social Insurance as amended&#13;
with effect as of February 1, 2004 and Law No. 511/1992on the Administration of Taxes and&#13;
Fees as amended with effect as of January 1, 2004) have eliminated remaining obstacles to&#13;
public sector arrearsresolution.&#13;

&#13;
 A package of amendments to the Civil Code reforming the collateral regime, prepared with&#13;

&#13;
A new modern securitieslaw satisfactoryto the Bank is in effect as of January 1, 2002. The law&#13;
brings the legislative framework for capital markets activity in line with the EU Acquis&#13;
 Communautaire. In selected areas, further improvement is still possible as outlined in the&#13;
International Organization of Governmental Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Assessment&#13;
undertaken in the context of the Slovak FSAP undertaken in FebruaryMarch 2002, and in the&#13;

       Enactment of amendments to the Commercial Code, in substance satisfactory to the&#13;
       Bank.&#13;
&#13;
A major overhaul of the Commercial Code, satisfactoryto the Bank, was enacted in late 2001.&#13;
Notwithstanding the fact that the overhaulmet the condition, the Bank communicated its view to&#13;
the Government that in selected areas further improvements could usefully be considered to&#13;
bring Slovakia's corporate governance regime fully in line with emerging international best&#13;
practice standards, and for this purpose suggested to undertake a stand-alone Corporate&#13;
Governance ROSC. The Government agreed to this suggestion and a Corporate Governance&#13;
ROSC was undertaken during the spring of 2003. Its findings were formally endorsed by the&#13;
Governmentin July 2003 and a seminarwas held in February2004 to disseminatethe findingsof&#13;
the ROSC.&#13;

Met through Act 9612002 on the Supervision over the Financial Market and on the Change and&#13;
the Amendment of Certain Acts, effective as of April 1, 2002. Ideally, the Financial Markets&#13;
Authority (FMA) should also have the power to issue regulations (this power now rests with the&#13;
MOF). This will be possible afterthe planned merger of the FMA with the NBS by 2006. Further&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                - 9 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
improvements could also be made in salary levels for FMA staff to allow it to attract and retain&#13;
sufficiently qualified people. This issue also likely will be resolved through the planned merger&#13;
of the FMA with the NBS.&#13;

            Slovak Republic - Enterprise and Financial
            Sector Adjustment Loan Project : release of the Third
            Tranche - Full Compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Slovak authorities have completed
            the implementation of the Program, as evidenced by the
            successful restructuring and privatization of the three
            large former state-owned banks, resolution through sale,
            closure or corrective action of all smaller problem banks,
            strengthening of bank supervision, and enactment of new
            legislation in the areas of  banking, insurance, and
            securities markets, commercial law and secured lending.
            Additionally, satisfactory progress has been made towards
            resolving public sector arrears, and bad loans taken off the
            books of the state banks, and preparation of new laws on
            bankruptcy, and regulation of  bankruptcy trustees. These
            reforms have contributed to higher economic growth, a
            reduction in unemployment, and substantial foreign direct
            investment inflows.  On this basis, and also taking into
            account that all third tranche release conditions specified
            in the Loan Agreement have been met, it is justified to
            release the third tranche of the Loan. In view of the
            overall performance and progress with the implementation of
            the Program supported by the Loan, and in compliance with
            the specific conditions of release as described in Schedule
            3, Section II of the Loan Agreement, the Bank has informed
            the Borrower of the availability of the third tranche of EUR
            70 million.
