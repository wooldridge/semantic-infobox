Introduction&#13;
This report presents the Second Mexican Basic Health Project for which an IBRD Loan&#13;
of US$310.0 million to Nacional Financiera S.N. C. (NAFIN) is proposed. The project is consistent&#13;
with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)2 for Mexico. It will improve the health status of&#13;
the poor in the eleven most disadvantaged states at a total cost of US$443.4 million. The proposed&#13;
project builds on the First Basic Health Care project (PASSPA 1)3 which is expected to close in 1996.&#13;
Chapter I on the Health Sector describes the socioeconomic sector settings, health care&#13;
financing, analyzes prominent health sector issues, lessons learned and sets forth the Government's&#13;
strategy and rationale for Bank involvement. Chapter II on the Project describes the three project&#13;
components which include: a strategy for providing a basic health care package selected from a menu&#13;
of cost-effective interventions; the support that the project will provide for institutional development to&#13;
decentralize services and functions from the federal level to the states and transfer responsibilities from&#13;
the states to the health jurisdictions; and the initiative for modernizing and restructuring of the&#13;
Secretariat for Health (SSA) to assume an active leadership and regulatory role. Chapter III on&#13;
Agreements summarizes agreements reached and lists conditions to be applied to the loan. Additional&#13;
background information is provided in the Annex section.&#13;
1. THE HEALTH SECTOR&#13;
A. SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
1.1    Background: The peso devaluation in late December 1994 triggered an economic and&#13;
financial crisis which is resulting, during 1995, in negative economic growth, high interest rates and&#13;
inflation of about 42 percent.  With the assistance of the international financial institutions, the&#13;
Government is taking the necessary steps to avert a banking crisis, which would plunge the economy&#13;
into an even deeper recession. In addition, a Program of Essential Social Services (PROSSE),&#13;
supported by the Bank Group and IDB, intends to support the Government to establish a social safety&#13;
net, by financing emergency programs in health, education and labor markets.&#13;
1.2    Despite this recent financial crisis, however, Mexico's overall development over the past decade&#13;
has been substantial. The country overcame the debt crisis of the 1 980s and achieved economic growth&#13;
after structural adjustment. The Salinas administration introduced macroeconomic stabilization and an&#13;
ambitious public sector reform program. Many social issues were addressed, in particular health,&#13;
education and rural poverty. The increase in social expenditures accounted for over 40 percent of all&#13;
program expenditures. Government's health measures consisted primarily of improving access to basic&#13;
health and social services, expanding immunization coverage and other primary health care (PHC)&#13;
programs, and increasing the provision of safe water and waste disposal. As a result, life expectancy&#13;
increased over the last two decades, from 58 to 70.3 years, and infant mortality declined from 74 to 35&#13;
deaths per 1,000 live births.&#13;
2 CAS: Report No. 14518-ME; May 22, 1995, discussed by the Board on June 22, 1995 with the Financial Sector Restructuring Loan&#13;
and the Program of Essential Social Services.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.3    There is an unfinished agenda, however. Nearly 30 million people still live in poverty without&#13;
adequate access to health and social services. Of a total population of 84 million, 25 percent are&#13;
considered poor, and another 16 percent (13 million) are extremely poor and not able to meet their&#13;
basic needs.4 Real per capita income in the richer (mainly northern) states is more than twice that in&#13;
the poorer (mainly southern) states. Urban centers and the northem states have health indicators&#13;
similar to OECD levels, while in urban slums, rural areas and the southern states the poor are still&#13;
subject to an epidemiological pattern,5 characterized by common infections and malnutrition. Life&#13;
expectancy stands at 55 years in rural areas versus 71 years in urban areas, and 53 years among the&#13;
poor compared to 73 years among the wealthy. Similarly, infant mortality ranges from under 20 per&#13;
1,000 in the wealthier northern states, to more than 50 per 1,000 in the poor southem states. Urban&#13;
elites and the middle class are increasingly subject to an epidemiological pattem7 with a higher burden&#13;
of chronic diseases. These disparities place conflicting demands on health services and represent a&#13;
major challenge for the Mexican health care system.&#13;
1.4    While trying to address these new  pattems of chronic disease, the health system  must&#13;
simultaneously provide equitable access to primary health care for the poor, who suffer from a heavy&#13;
burden of communicable diseases. The Government is committed to the goals laid out in the UN-&#13;
sponsored "World Summit for Children"6 and has achieved considerable progress in reaching the&#13;
Summit's principal objectives. It has addressed health problems through large scale vertical programs&#13;
such as universal childhood immunization and diarrhea control, which have substantially reduced&#13;
infant mortality. However, much more remains to be done. Many services do not reach the poor and&#13;
the quality of services is often unsatisfactory. According to national estimates, about 11 percent of the&#13;
poor have no access to health services. Moreover, according to national survey data, one third of the&#13;
population feel that their health needs are currently not met by the health care system, although the&#13;
proportion dissatisfied with services received varies widely, from 20 percent among the middle class,&#13;
7&#13;
to 31 percent among the poor and reaches a high 47 percent among indigenous people.  Prenatal care&#13;
barely reaches 25 percent of pregnant women, (mostly living in pen-urban slums and rural areas), and&#13;
34 percent give birth without any professional assistance.8&#13;
1.5    As part of its poverty alleviation policy and to ease the most prominent health problems facing&#13;
the uninsured, the Government has adopted several strategies. These include targeting interventions to&#13;
reach the most disadvantaged areas in the poorest states. In addition, social security was expanded and&#13;
coverage of the IMSS-Solidandad program  increased (a Government financed basic health care&#13;
program for the uninsured, rural poor under the auspices of the Mexican Social Security Institute -&#13;
Instituwo Mexicano de Seguro Social - IMSS). An attempt has also been made to augment the mandate&#13;
of the Secretariat of Health (Secretaria de Salud - SS4) to determine sector priorities, to re-allocate&#13;
resources from  curative to public health and transfer decision-making power from  federal to state&#13;
health authorities (SHAs). The Bank financed First Basic Health Care project (Loan No.3272-ME;&#13;
FY 1990) supports these initiatives in four states9 and marginal areas in the Federal District (Annex 1).&#13;

President Salinas, signed an agreement to reduce infant and maternal mortality, reduce malnutrition, provide drinldng water, sanitation, access to&#13;
education and protect children in difficult circumstances.&#13;

1.6   However, these measures, which increased federal health spending to 2.8 percent of GDP by&#13;
1994 (accounting for 23 percent of total federal expenditures),'0 have been only parfally effective.&#13;
Health service access and poor service quality continue to be problems. The effectiveness of the health&#13;
budget is impaired by institutional fragmentation, managerial weakness and duplication of services,&#13;
resulting in a loss of efficiency, equity and quality. The Government intends to rationalize resource&#13;
allocation, to search for alternatives to sole government provision and financing of health services, and&#13;
to strengthen the role of the private sector.&#13;
B. HEALTH SECTOR ORGANIZATION AND FINANCING&#13;
1.7   The Second National Health Survey" found in 1994 that people who had sought fonmal health&#13;
care during the previous 15 days had done so through the following sources:&#13;
Private sector providers (32.9 percent);&#13;
IMSS, for fonnal sector employees and their families (31.5 percent);&#13;
Social Securty Institute for Federal Government Employees (Inslituo de Salud y Servicios&#13;
Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado - ISSSTE) (6.4 percent);&#13;
IMSS-Solidanidad (2.8 percent);&#13;
SSA (18.4 percent); and&#13;
Others (8 percent).&#13;
Some 98,624 physicians, 4,730 dentists, and 148,957 nurses and auxiliary nurses work for public&#13;
institutions; about 56.5 percent are employees of IMSS and ISSSTE and serve the half of the Mexican&#13;
population that is insured by these agencies. The other 43.5 percent of health workers are employed&#13;
by the SSA and state health authorities. These workers provide fewer services per capita to the&#13;
uninsured population than are available to social security affiliates. The main providers of health&#13;
services and the affiliates/population they cover are presented in Annex 2, and summarized as follows:&#13;

1.8 Overview of Health Hnancing. After 1988 the Salinas administration made health care a&#13;
priority. As a result, federal health spending increased nearly 15 percent per year in real terms and&#13;
has now reached an estimated 2.8 percent of GDP, or around 17 percent of the federal programmable&#13;
budget. Overall, IMSS and ISSSTE account for 68 percent of federal health expenditure; the SSA, for&#13;
27 percent; and the Anned Forces and other parastatal entities, such as PEMEX, account for the&#13;
remaining 5 percent. Spending increases, however, have not been evenly distributed between the main&#13;
providers. Between 1987 and 1993, IMSS increased spending by 80 percent, ISSSTE by 23 percent,&#13;
and the SSA by 44 percent. Although spending increased in the SSA, resources are disproportionately&#13;

allocated to salaries and administrative costs. In addition to the increases in spending by the SSA and&#13;
the social security institutes, the decline in quality of public services and increases in income levels&#13;
have led to a rapid increase in private sector spending, which now accounts for at least 2 percent of&#13;
GDP, or an estimated US$79 per capita. (Annex 3 provides a description of health care financing).&#13;

C. HEALTH SECTOR ISSUES&#13;
1.9    Despite increases in public health care spending and a notable improvement in the SSA's&#13;
service network over the past six years, issues grouped under equity, quality and efficiency continue to&#13;
affect the health care delivery system, particularly in the poorest states.&#13;
Equity&#13;
1.10 Lack of Access. Access to health care is a constitutional right for all Mexicans. Yet more&#13;
than 10 percent of the population do not have access to permanent health services at all. About 39&#13;
million Mexicans are uninsured and depend on services provided mainly by the SSA and IMSS -&#13;
Solidaridad.14  Among factors limiting access, the following are the most prominent: (a) geographic&#13;
isolation as a result of difficult terrain and lack of roads or transport (in the project states, about 55&#13;
percent of the population live in rural communities of less than 5,000 inhabitants, which usually do not&#13;
have health facilities); (b) poor quality of care and lack of health personnel, basic medicines and&#13;
supplies in many rurl health centers, which lead users to skip the first level of the system and seek&#13;
assistance in secondary and tertiary level facilities; (c) cultural barriers which limit the use of modem&#13;
health services, mostly in indigenous communities where the population relies on taditional healers&#13;
and midwives; and (d) a poor referral system which constrains access to secondary and teriary care.&#13;
Many of these issues would be addressed through both the basic health care and the institutional&#13;
development components of the proposed project. More services can be made available, if states&#13;
participate in budget planning, service administration gets improved, the basic service network is&#13;
expanded and rehabilitated, private sector participation is promoted and incentives are used to attract&#13;
personnel for hardship areas.&#13;

14 In 1992, 55S% (48 million) of the population had access to services through the social security system, and only 2% of the population is&#13;
covered by private in_ure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.11   Structural barriers to access to health services, including shortages of essential drugs and&#13;
supplies in public clinics, force many families to pay out-of-pocket to satisfy their health needs, at&#13;
costs that are prohibitive in relation to low incomes. A FUNSALUD"5 study revealed that in 1994,&#13;
38 percent of citizens had to estrict family expenses to pay their medical bills. About 1.6 million&#13;
families experienced catastrophic illnesses in 1992, with costs so high that basic family needs were&#13;
jeopardized. These issues would be addressed through the proposed project both in the basic health&#13;
care and the institutional development components, by increasing coverage in the niml areas through&#13;
the use of Primary Health Care Technicians (TAPS), 16 auxiliary nurses and health promoters,&#13;
rehabilitating of the basic health network and reallocating and training personnel. Basic health services&#13;
will be made available to those states and health jurisdictions which are most in need. Furthermore,&#13;
the project would promote community involvement in health: participation in mainning health&#13;
posts, incentive schemes to induce health personnel to work in remote areas and testing of innovative&#13;
approaches to health provision and financing involving the private sector. Additionally, where user&#13;
fees are collected, the project would support their reinvestment at the facility level under supervision of&#13;
community authorities (Presidentes Mwnicipales).&#13;
1.12 Inequitable Distribution of the Burden of Disease. Another recent study by FUNSALUD&#13;
demonstrated that Mexico lost 12.8 million disease-ad4usted life years (DALYs) due to premature&#13;
death and disability in 1991, mostly in poor niral areas  where the burden of disease and disability is&#13;
largest, particularly among males. Children under 5 years account for more than a third of the disease&#13;
burden, mostly due to infectious diseases. The economically active population (15 to 44 years) is&#13;
subject to an ever increasing burden of chronic diseases and traumas. In addition to this FUNSALUD&#13;
study, the Banks 1993 World Development Report (WDR) and a policy study commissioned by the&#13;
SSA18 set the framework to define health priorities for Mexico.'9 The basic health care component of&#13;
the proposed project would address these priorities by providing access to a basic health care package&#13;
including both public health and basic clinical services. The targeting mechanism of the project would&#13;
maximize the impact of investments by selecting communities with the highest disease burden.&#13;
1.13  Inequitable Distribution of Fmancial Resources.  Despite increases in federal health&#13;
expenditures and considerable investments in the poorer states, the distribution of resources between&#13;
states remains highly inequitable. The project states receive 25 percent fewer resources per capita&#13;
from the SSA budget than the national average, although the burden of disease in those states is&#13;
significantly higher than the national average. Resource allocation to the states does not consider their&#13;
revenue generating capacity; in fact, states with the highest tax revenues per capita receive higher per&#13;
capita resources from the SSA. The First Basic Health Care project addressed these issues by directing&#13;
additional resources to the poorest states. The proposed new project would continue to correct this&#13;
inequitable distribution by: (a) targeting reGources, using as criteria epidemiological and demographic&#13;
indicators; (b) defining resource allocation according to public health and basic curative service&#13;
priorities; and (c) testing altematives for health care financing and service provision.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Quality&#13;
1.14 Low Quality of Services. The quality of the health services provided to the uninsured&#13;
population is generally poor. This was confirmed by a qualitative study on customer satisfaction20&#13;
which found that 83 percent of users were dissatisfied. The principal reasons were: (a) poor service;&#13;
(b) lack of resources, such as drugs and well trained personnel; (c) lack of access; and (d) high costs.&#13;
In addition, the study revealed that quality issues are not limited to the lack of resources, personnel and&#13;
technical problems; 40 percent of patients felt that they were not treated adequately, 61 percent&#13;
considered services too bureaucratic, 8 percent did not receive medical treatment when needed, and 26&#13;
percent had to postpone an intervention for economic reasons. These perceptions are not limited to&#13;
users of health services; physicians and local health authorities also identify them as major constraints.&#13;
An expert panel found quality problems in 73 percent of SSA health center visits. The main reasons&#13;
for these shortcomings are linked to deficiencies in infrastructure, health personnel involved in service&#13;
delivery, and lack of accountability of managers. As a consequence, the poor, who rely on SSA's&#13;
health services, have to incur out of pocket expenses for pnvate care or, in extreme cases, have to&#13;
forego medical treatment. The proposed project would address these issues through: (a) improving the&#13;
provision of services; (b) rationalizing procurement and distribution of drugs; (c) enhancing regulation,&#13;
accreditation and evaluation procedures; (d) providing technical and total quality management training&#13;
to health personnel; (e) empowering local communities to provide feed-back on the perceived quality&#13;
of health services through participating in the staff incentives program.&#13;
1.15 Deterioration of Health Services Network. Health facilities in the project states are generally&#13;
in poor conditions. The overall deterioration of the delivery system was demonstrated in the&#13;
infrastructure inventory carried out before the implementation of the ongoing health project. It showed&#13;
that many facilities in fact were no longer operational. This was mainly due to insufficient funding for&#13;
basic maintenance, lack of personnel, supervision and managerial constraints. While the First Basic&#13;
Health Care project restored the most seriously damaged facilities in four states, many of the&#13;
deficiencies are also present in the new project states. As a consequence, patients bypass first level&#13;
care and go directly to second and third level facilities, at higher costs both for patients and&#13;
institutions.&#13;
1.16  The physical decay of infrstructure and equipment contributes to a vicious cycle. Staff are&#13;
demotivated to work in a deteriorated workplace and patients refuse to attend those facilities and prefer&#13;
to attend district hospitals, despite high opportunity costs for travel and waiting time.  The&#13;
Government tried to break this cycle with programs such as the Hospital Digno and with interventions,&#13;
supported by the ongoing project, to engage the community more in the maintenance of facilities after&#13;
their rehabilitation or construction. Once the civil works program is concluded, 1,141 mostly nurl&#13;
health post and 25 hospitals will have been upgrded and 267 new first level care facilities will have&#13;
been constructed. In order to reduce deterioration in the poorest areas, the proposed project would&#13;
finance construction and rehabilitation of first level facilities only if justified as cost-effective means to&#13;
delivering the basic health package. The project will also address the issue of preventive maintenance&#13;
for existing health facilities, by encouraging the states to allocate resources for infrastructure&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
1.17 Staff Skill Mix and Allocation. Overall, Mexico has 24 hospital beds per 10,000 people, but&#13;
the distribution is inequitable; only 5 public hospital beds per 10,000 people are available to the&#13;
20 Fwicuesta de SatAcd6n con los Servwos de Salod en Mczw. F'USA4LUD; 05/94&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
uninsured poor in the project states (Annex 5 provides data on health facilities in the project area).&#13;
Mexico has one doctor for every 652 people, but too few health professionals, such as nurses and&#13;
primary care technicians. There is only one nurse per 495 people, which is 50 percent less than in&#13;
other middle income countries.21 In addition, doctors tend to be concentrated in urban areas, whereas&#13;
most rural areas cannot attract permanent health professionals. Newly graduated doctors are supposed&#13;
to practice a year of social service in nral municipalities as part of the licensing requirement (medcos&#13;
pasantes). However, due to poor pay, poor living conditions and inadequate supervision, an ever&#13;
shnnking proportion of graduates actually fulfills this requirement, leaving many rural health posts&#13;
empty. Because of a centrally managed staff roster and a number of unauthorized positions, SSA staff&#13;
are distributed unevenly. In reviewing the staffing pattem of the project states, the SSA found that&#13;
about 10 percent of staff were appointed outside civil service norms. Frequently, actual functions and&#13;
tasks performed by SSA staff differ considerably from the job description and assignment originally&#13;
intended. Attempts to reassign or reclassify staff in the past have met strong union resistance and&#13;
reluctance of some SSA central offices. The proposed project would address this issue by: financing&#13;
the training of primary care technicians (TAPS) for rural health posts; helping the SSA to rationalize&#13;
the staff skill mix and staff allocation; devolving to the states greater autonomy in allocating staff&#13;
according to actual needs; supporting staff incentive programs for hardship areas; and providing&#13;
technical training to health staff at state and jurisdictional levels.&#13;
Efficiency&#13;
1.18 Decentralization. Greater efficiency can be achieved by decentralizing management functions&#13;
and budgets to the states and transfer responsibilities to health jurisdictions. SSA management at the&#13;
federal level has not been sensitive to local needs in the past or has been limited in its ability to act, due to&#13;
bureaucratic requirements and processes. Distance and several layers of administration often delay&#13;
remedial actions at the local level. During previous administrations, 14 of the 32 states were&#13;
decentralized; this transferred some, but not all decision-making power such as planning, budgeting&#13;
and personnel from the federal to the state level. However, decentralization came to a halt in the past&#13;
administration. The new administration intends to complete and deepen decentralizaton in all statesW2&#13;
Experience in the ongoing project shows that after investing in institutional development and de facto&#13;
transferring functions and decision making from the federal to the state level the base for de jure&#13;
decentralization is established. The proposed project would support the transfer of more management,&#13;
technical and administrative functions (including planning, budgeting, procurement, and personnel&#13;
management) from the federal to the state and from the state to the health jurisdictions.&#13;
1.19  Management Constraints. The efficiency of health spending and provision has been impaired&#13;
in the past by managerial weakness at all levels. Inappropriate management practices have prevented&#13;
adequate responses to both the epidemiological dynamic and the health needs of the population. For&#13;
example, although health, financial and administrative data are routinely collected, the quality of the&#13;
data is often unreliable and indicators are not used as management tools. Surveillance and research are&#13;
often seen as ends in themselves, rather than means for facilitating decision making. To coriect this&#13;
problem, the Institutional Development and Decentraization Component of the project would finance&#13;
Management Information Systems (MIS) and management training at all service levels. A special&#13;
training program would be designed to enable health managers to use data, hence allowing staff to use&#13;
the resources at their disposal more effectively and to evaluate the effects of their interventions.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
1.20 Management Information Systems (MIS). Over the past several years, the SSA has&#13;
considerably improved the epidemiological information system. However, the lack of parallel&#13;
financial, accounting, and management information systems to generate indicators for policy-making,&#13;
planning, and management puiposes has limited the use of the systems for decision making.&#13;
Information on the regulatory functions of the federal SSA (such as supervision, sanitary regulation&#13;
and quality control) is highly fragmented or non existent. And, frequently the available information is&#13;
not used for policy-maling. At the state levels, a lack of computers, software and trained staff has&#13;
also constrained the effectiveness of the information systems and information on personnel,&#13;
pharmaceuticals, and inventories is inadequate. The proposed project would support the development&#13;
of management information systems by consolidating the MIS started under the ongoing project and&#13;
implementing the improved MIS system in the new project states. In addition, it would finance&#13;
training of SSA staff at the federal and state level so that they can make timely, better informed&#13;
decisions.&#13;
1.21 Health Financing. Total health spending has reached an estimated 4.8 percent of GDP, and&#13;
annual spending of the SSA has increased 44 percent in real terms since 1987. In 1992, federal&#13;
expenditures for health reached 2.8 percent of GDP, or US$106 per capita, while private outlays&#13;
amounted to US$79 per capita (Annex 3). Although health expenditures have nearly recovered to&#13;
levels seen before the economic crisis in 1977, several constraints still limit efficiency of health sector&#13;
spending: (a) a bias towards costly interventions; (b) centralized decision making and resource&#13;
allocation; (c) lack of financial management tools at die central and local levels; and (d) constraints on&#13;
resource availability for dnigs and medical supplies, maintenance, and well trained personnel. The&#13;
proposed project would address these issues through institutional development, improvement in&#13;
resource allocation and by creating opportunities for testing alternatives for health financing involving&#13;
the private sector.&#13;
1.22 Misallocation of health spending also constrains quantity and quality of health services for the&#13;
uninsured population and prevents improvement in health conditions.  To improve the health&#13;
conditions of the poor, more resources must be allocated to neglected areas and the orientation to&#13;
costly interventions has to be addressed by reducing overspending on administration (currently 31&#13;
percent) and increasing preventive programs, now at a low 5 percent compared to 64 percent for&#13;
curative programs. Financing a basic package of interventions would focus resources on the most cost&#13;
effective interventions and ensure that critical inputs to the delivery of health services, pharmaceuticals&#13;
and appropriate categories of trained staff are provided in priority areas.&#13;
1.23  Centalized decision making contributes to inefficient resource use too. Health care spending&#13;
levels and priority areas detennined at the central level result in ineffective allocation and lack of&#13;
accountability and transparency for resource use. Annual budgeting decisions are based on a centrally&#13;
defined health care model and on historical budgets, with limited flexibility and lack of incentives to&#13;
optimize resource use. The lack of financial, accounting and control systems both limits local decision&#13;
making and impedes informed central policy making.&#13;
1.24  Reductions in federal resources have led to increased user fee revenues and increasing&#13;
participation of state governments. In the project states, user fee revenues (cuotas de recuperaci6n)&#13;
have increased annually at over 68 percent in real terms, and now account for almost 10 percent of&#13;
total revenues. At the facility level, user fee revenues surpassed the federal budget allocation 2 to 3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
times in some cases. Many of the poorest families seek care in the private sector due to poor quality&#13;
or unavailability of equipment and resources. This suggests that if the quality of public services can be&#13;
enhanced, there is considerable scope for increasing cost recovery for services, pharmaceuticals, and&#13;
supplies. The autonomy and efficiency with which these revenues are spent, however, is limited by&#13;
federal regulations requiring that 15 percent of all revenues be retumed to the central level and by&#13;
strict guidelines on the use of the resources at facilities.23  Allowing facilities and state health&#13;
authorities to retain all user fees and revising the regulations goveming user fee expenditures would&#13;
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of these expenditures. Contributions from state and municipal&#13;
govemments have also been increasing, in response to the decline of federal resources. State&#13;
contributions, an average 3 percent of total sector spending, are typically used to finance projects of&#13;
special interest to the state, such as infrastructure in priority areas, or the response to epidemiological&#13;
emergencies. Devolving functions from federal to state levels would increase accountability and&#13;
transparency in state spending, and also improve community participation. The proposed project would&#13;
achieve efficiency gains by targeting resources, promoting disease prevention, providing a cost-&#13;
effective basic health package and implementing a decentralized budgetary process and improving&#13;
accounting, control, and auditing systems at the state and local levels.&#13;
D. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.25   Lessons Learned.  The First Basic Health Care project was the first health related Bank&#13;
experience in Mexico and provided the most valuable lessons to consider for the proposed project.&#13;
Most prominent lessons are: (a) Targeting. While the First Basic Health Project targeted poor states,&#13;
resources often did not reach populations most in need within the state. Therefore, it is necessary to&#13;
target delivery of a cost-effective basic health care package to the most disadvantaged municipalities&#13;
within a poor state. This is the approach being followed under the proposed project by focusing on&#13;
jurisdictional investment programs. (b) Improve Access to Basic Health Care. The First Basic&#13;
Health Project supported infrastructure rehabilitation of first level health centers and second level&#13;
hospitals in order to provide an environment suitable for basic services of high quality for the&#13;
uninsured. It has been demonstrated that the use factor of rehabilitated facilities with adequate medical&#13;
staff and supplies increased significantly.  The proposed project will continue to finance the&#13;
rehabilitation of the first and second level care network to provide quality services to the uninsured and&#13;
operate mobile units to support effective outreach to small communities without health centers. (c)&#13;
Rural Staffing. The First Basic Health Care project supported the training and recruitment of&#13;
community health care workers (TAPS) who are selected from the community where they wil serve.&#13;
They were utilized in the project for staffing health posts in communities where no medical doctor was&#13;
available and they have been instrumental in increasing the user rate of the basic health service&#13;
network. The proposed project will build on this successful experience and finance training of more&#13;
TAPS to serve remote communities. (d) Build Ownership in the States. The First Basic Health&#13;
Care project featured institution building by decentralizing procurement of essential supplies and&#13;
improving the management capacity and information systems. The proposed project will continue to&#13;
support project states' institutional capacity through the training programs and decentralizing project&#13;
implementation. It would also promote the involvement of political stakeholders, particularly the State&#13;
Governors, to guarantee continued support for the project, foster ownership and sustainability. (e)&#13;
Joint Annual Review Meetings: The First Basic Health Project featured joint annual project review&#13;
23 Although the decenbalzed sates retain 100 percent of the revenues, the facilites are obligated to return between 25 and 30 percent to&#13;
the state level. In the centazed states, the facilities retain approximately 70 pecent, then return 15 percent to ihe federal level and 15%&#13;
to the state level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
meetings and a mid-term review with the Bank and the Government. The proposed project would&#13;
continue this practice and use these meetings to review the preparation of annual implementation and&#13;
work plans and evaluate the performance of subprojects and other project elements.&#13;
E. GOVERNMENT AND SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
1.26  Improving the effectiveness, efficiency and quality of health services, particularly in the four&#13;
poorest states was a high priority in the development agenda of the past Govemment. But recent&#13;
developments, especially social unrest in Chiapas, demonstrated that equitable access to health care has&#13;
not yet been achieved. This hampers economic development in poor regions, jeopardizes investments&#13;
in basic education and deprives citizens of their constitutional right to health care.  The new&#13;
Government will continue a strategy of reducing inequities in access to basic health care, targeting&#13;
those states with the lowest poverty indicators, and improving quality and resource use.&#13;
1.27 In addition, administrative reforms of the SSA will take place. To promote them, a Health&#13;
Cabinet (Gabinete de Salud) was established to guide the SSA restnucturing and to promote&#13;
coordination among sectors, in particular for decentralizing services to the states and providing better&#13;
access to health care for the poor. This Cabinet, created by presidential decree, is headed by the&#13;
President and includes reprsentatives from social security, finance and other social sector entities.&#13;
1.28  The SSA would redefine its institutional structure and functions, by assuming the lead role in&#13;
the sector in: (a) defining national health policy, policy analysis, monitoring norms and regulations;&#13;
(b) strengthening the state health services by transfening functions and responsibilities from the central&#13;
level to the state and from the state to jurisdictional levels; and (c) guaranteeing the delivery of basic&#13;
24&#13;
health interventions, regardless of social, economic, cultumal or geographic factors. In a recent study&#13;
commissioned by the SSA to assess the needs for sector modernization and the implications for the&#13;
institution, the following essential strategies were outlined:&#13;
* Secure universal access to a basic package of health seruces&#13;
Einphasize public health and disease prevenion&#13;
I *ncrease insitutional response to the needs of the most vulnerable population groups&#13;
Focus on development of human resources and incentives for community participation&#13;
* Foster institutional development and provide better quality service&#13;
* Decentralizefinctions and responsibilities from federal to state and transfer responsibilities to&#13;
health jurisdictions.&#13;
1.29  There exists broad consensus in Mexico that implementing these strategies would be achieved&#13;
by supporting a three pronged approach: (i) promote access to basic health care services, 2 (ii) foster&#13;
institutional development and decentalization of services and functions; and (iii) support the&#13;
modernization of the SSA at the federal level. The project with its three components (i) Basic Health&#13;
Care Services, (ii) Institutional Development and Decentralization and (iii) Modernization and&#13;
Restructuring of the SSA, is in line with this strategy. Specifically, the Government would use the&#13;
project to: (a) correct imbalances in the eleven poorest states carrying the greatest burden of disease by&#13;
offering a basic health care package; (b) decentalize services in all states by supporting institutional&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
development; and (c) assist the SSA in institutional modernization by implementing the&#13;
recommendations of studies and pilot projects on sector reform, policy, legal and operational issues.&#13;
F. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEM'LENT&#13;
1.30  The proposed project is consistent with the Bank Group's country assistance strategy (CAS)&#13;
discussed by the Board on June 22, 1995 together with the Financial Sector Restructuring Loan and the&#13;
Program of Essential Social Services which inter alla emphasizes poverty reduction, human resource&#13;
development and institutional development. The First Basic Health Care Project provided an effective&#13;
model for improving the health status of the poor in five project states; the new project would expand&#13;
and deepen this experience in seven additional target states. This would complement the objectives of&#13;
other Bank-financed projects (Primary Education I and II, Initial Education, Low-Income Housing,&#13;
Decentralization and Rural Development II, Water Supply and Sanitation Projects) that contribute to&#13;
poverty alleviation and equitable access to social services in many of the same states. The proposed&#13;
project provides an opportunity for the Bank to support the Mexican Government in carrying out the&#13;
Bank's recommendations for the health sector, presented in the 1993 World Development Report,&#13;
especially to redirect health expenditures to the most cost-effective interventions ('buy the cheap&#13;
DALYs first").&#13;
1.31 The last administration laid the groundwork for enabling the new Government to alleviate the&#13;
most prominent health problems facing the uninsured. The Bank would support these efforts through&#13;
the proposed project, which draws on the experience of the First Basic Health Care Project, health&#13;
sector work and the project preparation effort:&#13;
(a)    The First Basic Health Care project (Ln. No. 3272 - ME)26 was initiated in 1991 and is&#13;
expected to close in June 1996. It promotes an integrated approach to decrease the disease burden of&#13;
the poor in the country's four poorest states and the Federal District (Annex 1). It also provided&#13;
valuable experience and lessons learned for the preparation of this project.&#13;
(b)   A health sector study was initiated by last administration, with the assistance of the Bank, IDB,&#13;
and WHO. Its purpose was to: (a) define sector policies and priorities for cost-effective health&#13;
interventions and investments; (b) by outline the appropriate roles of the SSA, social security, non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector in the provision of health care services; (c)&#13;
identify means of strengthening sector financing and more efficient use of resources.&#13;
(c)    The preparation of the Second Basic Health Care Project, which aims to eliminate many of the&#13;
constraints of the health sector, such as the lack of access, equity, productivity, efficiency, and quality,&#13;
the Government plans to expand basic health coverage for uninsured and underserved populations,&#13;
using a health risk-focused and decentralized approach. At the same time, it plans to strengthen the&#13;
institutions at federal, state and jurisdictional levels and to decentralize services in order to achieve a&#13;
more efficient and effective service delivery and to modernize the SSA to enhance its leadership&#13;
function in the health sector.&#13;

.2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT CONCEPT AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1   Concept. The overall purpose of the second Basic Health Care project is to improve the health&#13;
status of the uninsured population by supporting the Government's strategy for the health sector, which&#13;
aims at a targeted delivery of basic health care, and implementing policy, institutional and operational&#13;
reforms to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of health services. The proposed project&#13;
draws on the experience of the First Basic Health Care project and continues to support the&#13;
Government' s policy of providing assistance to the less developed states and jurisdictions and improve&#13;
the health conditions of 15 million uninsured and underserved poor living in eleven project states.&#13;
2.2   Objectives: (a) support equitable access to a cost-effective package of quality health services&#13;
for the uninsured and underserved; (b) support institutional development through the modernization&#13;
and decentralization of technical, managerial, and financing processes in the states; and (c) support the&#13;
modernization and restructuring of the SSA to assume an active leadership role in the sector. This will&#13;
be achieved through three components:&#13;
2.3   I. Basic Health Care Component. This component supports a basic health care package,&#13;
with interventions selected from a predefined menu and targeted to the most disadvantaged areas. The&#13;
health care package will be prepared and implemented by states and jurisdictions through annual&#13;
investment plans, considering local priorities and focusing on cost effective preventive and curative&#13;
interventions.&#13;
2.4 II. Institutional Development and Decentralization Component. This component improves&#13;
the management and decision-making capacity in the states and jurisdictions through training,&#13;
strengthening of support systems (planning, supervision, procurement and MIS) and decentralizes&#13;
functions and services from the center to the states and transfers responsibilities from the states to the&#13;
health jurisdictions.&#13;
2.5   m. Modernization and Restructuring of the SSA. This component supports institutional&#13;
and operational reforms in the SSA, to restructure its central office, to modernize management,&#13;
budgeting and resource allocation, evaluation and information systems, and finances studies and pilot&#13;
tests for alternative health care delivery and financing.&#13;
B. PROJECT AREAS&#13;
2.6   The project covers the four states where the first project has been implemented (Oaxaca,&#13;
Chiapas, Guerrero and Hidalgo) and includes health risk areas in seven additional states (Puebla,&#13;
Veracruz, Zacatecas, Michoacdn, San Luis Potosi, Campeche and Yucatan). The inclusion of these&#13;
states is justified because of high poverty incidence, combined with health and epidemiological&#13;
indicators below the national averages. Specifically, project states and health jurisdictions were&#13;
selected with the help of a matrix of poverty indices27 and epidemiological and demographic2s&#13;
27 Indadores Socdoewwonucos e Indwe de Marginaci6n; Instiuto Nacional de E&amp;astfsca y Geografica, (INEGI) 1990/ CONAPO,&#13;
1990.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
surveillance data (Annex 2). Investments would be targeted to: (a) poor states, as determined by a&#13;
poverty index and health indicators; (b) selected health risk areas within project states; and (c)&#13;
uninsured and underserved populations. Specifically, the goals would be accomplished through an&#13;
innovative project design and a "bottom up" strategy that promotes investment at the local level.&#13;
Under state guidance and supervision, health jurisdictions would define health risk areas and prepare&#13;
annual action plans for contending with their principal health problems.&#13;
2.7     Selection Process. 29   The eleven project states and priority health jurisdictions were selected&#13;
based on three indicators: (i) the CONAPO (Consejo Nacional de Poblaci6n- National Population&#13;
Council) poverty index,30 (ii) routine epidemiological surveillance data3' on disease incidence and&#13;
prevalence and (iii) general mortality data (Annex 2 and 5). Poverty is usually associated with poor&#13;
heath status: In the project area, average life expectancy is 67 years, 5 percent below the national&#13;
average, and infant mortality is 42/1,000 compared with 35/1,000 for the national average. (Annex&#13;
5). In 1990, 32 percent of the population and 38 percent of the country's uninsured poor lived in the&#13;
eleven project states. Within the selected states, a similar procedure was followed for choosing&#13;
priority health jurisdictions and municipalities. Each participating state conducted a diagnostic survey&#13;
to detennine those health jurisdictions that should be included into the project area. As a result of this&#13;
exercise, the project would target the neediest people living in areas where both economic and health&#13;
conditions are worst. In its first year of operation, the project would be implemented in 16 of the total&#13;
of 78 health jurisdictions in the eleven project states benefiting a population of 3.8 million. In the&#13;
following years it would be gradually expanded to include a total of 60 jurisdictions, based on the&#13;
same targeting criteria, a competition mechanism for project funds, but also taking into account the&#13;
absorptive capacity of health jurisdictions. It is expected that a total population of 15 million,&#13;
constituting 53 percent of the entire population in the project states, would benefit from the project's&#13;
interventions. The Bank would require that the same selection criteria be followed if during the&#13;
duration of the project any other state would be added to the project area.&#13;

30 The CONAPO poverty index ranks staes, jurisdictions and mumcipalities based on results of "prinpl components analysis", using&#13;
the 1990 INEGI census, which takes the following variables into account: (a) population density; Q,) illiteracy in populon &gt; 15 years; (c)&#13;
population &gt; 15 years without pnnwy schooling; (d) saaon; (e) pertage of households without electicity; (f) drinking water; (g)&#13;
percentage of overrowded households; Oh) percentage of households with dirt floor; (1) percentage of population in localties of fewer&#13;
than 5000 inhabitants; j) per capita income of less than two minum salaries; and (k) presnce of indigenous population. The national&#13;
average would receives the index "0". A composite index between 0 and 1 would be considered as "high" , between 1 and 2 as 'very&#13;
high". A negative index (below 0) would indicate a better than national average poverty ituaon ('low") and would not be considered for&#13;
the project.&#13;

Component I: Basic Health Care Services (US$335.3 million or 75.6 penten tof total costs, induding&#13;
contingencies)&#13;
A. Public Health Interventions&#13;
B. Essential CliniCal Care&#13;
2.8    Basic Health Care Services.32  The objectives of the Basic Health Care Services component&#13;
are disease and injury prevention and health promotion through two strategies: (a) public health&#13;
programs that have a broad impact and generate positive externalities in the community and (b) a&#13;
predefined, cost-effective package of essential clinical care, responding to the health needs of the&#13;
individual, that reduces the burden of disease in the target population. In order to address the health&#13;
conditions of the uninsured poor this component would include: (i) public health outreach, covering&#13;
highly cost effective interventions in preventive health and (ii) public health education, promoting&#13;
lifestyle changes to prevent disease. Essential clinical services would be offered in clusters of cost&#13;
effective curative interventions. The investments financed through this component are included in a&#13;
menu of interventions prepared according to cost-effectiveness and epidemiological impact criteria&#13;
(Annex 4). Selected health jurisdictions (para. 2.7) would use this menu to fonnulate annual&#13;
investment subprojects.&#13;
2.9    Jurisdictions would prepare annual work and investment plans according to criteria, including&#13;
state health priorities, epidemiological profiles, poverty index, definition of beneficiaries, expected&#13;
increases in efficiency and quality, costs, and available technical and management capacity to&#13;
implement the plan. Furthermore, the project would use a new process for timely release and rapid&#13;
flow of budgetary funds to the states and jurisdictions. A federal Advisory Committee (Annex 14),&#13;
32 This component is striAusred in Pubhc Health Interventions and Essential Clinical Services. However, since it is impossible to separte&#13;
die delivery of those two subcomponents, the entire component was costed as one package.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
composed of representatives from the agencies directly involved in project implementation, would&#13;
review and approve annual work and investment plans.&#13;
2.10 The proposed project would support the primary health care network and the cost-effective&#13;
delivery of the basic health care package through the financing of: (a) civil works, including the&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of f[ealth infrastructure; (b) vehicles, including fully equipped medical&#13;
mobile units; (c) equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies; (d) personnel, technical assistance&#13;
and training; and (e) supervision (Annexes 7, 9, 10, 14).&#13;
Subcomponent I. A. Public Health Interventions:&#13;
1. Public Health Education&#13;
2. Public Health Outreach&#13;
2.11  This subcomponent has two main strategies: (a) public health education; and (b) public health&#13;
outreach. Public Health Education: Health education and promotion are cost-effective tools to&#13;
prevent infectious and chronic degenerative diseases and create awareness to prevent accidents and&#13;
addictions. Examples of health education and promotion programs that would be eligible for financing&#13;
through this component include priority topics such as: (a) children's health; (b) food hygiene; (c)&#13;
reproductive health; (d) nutritional education; (e) early detection of cancer; (f) mental health issues; (g)&#13;
prevention of accidents; (h) prevention of addictions; (i) healthy lifestyle promotion; 0) prevention of&#13;
vector bome and zoonotic diseases; and (k) promotion of oral health. The subcomponent would&#13;
support the preparation, printing and distribution of educational pamphlets, posters and air time for&#13;
spots in electronic media, including in native languages spoken by the major ethnic groups in the&#13;
project areas to reach effectively the indigenous population. In addition, the project would support&#13;
health education programs for schools and the community, by financing seminars and teaching&#13;
materials. The component would also finance the design and implementation of social marketing&#13;
programs to target specific regions in the states to promote health programs such as immunization,&#13;
diarrhea control or accident prevention.&#13;
2.12 Public Health Outreach. The project would strengthen public health outreach programs by&#13;
supporting the following groups of activities: (a) Prenatal, pregnancy, delivery care, family&#13;
planning, control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Training and equipment for midwives&#13;
would be provided to address prenatal, pregnancy and delivery care in remote areas. The project&#13;
would provide devices for reversible family planning, including contraceptive pills and barrier&#13;
methods. STD control would be achieved through condom distribution in high risk groups. (b) Well&#13;
baby clinics, child care and immunization: The project would finance immunization against&#13;
measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus and the immunization of women of childbearing age&#13;
to prevent neonatal tetanus. It would also finance the provision, storage and delivery of vaccines and&#13;
supplies, including syringes and needles, cold chain equipment such as refrigerators, mobile units and&#13;
the construction and maintenance of storage rooms for vaccines; further the project would promote and&#13;
finance well baby clinics for growth monitoring and of infants and nutrition counseling for their&#13;
mothers. (c) School Health: Comprehensive school health and dental programs are a cost-effective&#13;
method of preventing the development of more complicated clinical conditions later on. The project&#13;
would finance school health programs in the project jurisdictions with an emphasis on nutrition&#13;
counseling, ophthalmologic testing, bucodental health programs, deparasitation and school-based&#13;
reproductive health education programs.  (d) Infectious Diseases and Vector Control:  The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
component would finance detection, surveillance, follow-up and controlled treatment of infectious&#13;
diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy. Vector borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue would be&#13;
controlled through fumigation of endemic areas with environmentally safe residual insecticides. The&#13;
project would finance portable fumigation equipment and mobile outreach teams for early detection&#13;
and treatment of cases in endemic areas. (e) Water and sanitation: The project would provide for&#13;
water testing and monitoring of drinking water quality and chlorination, in order to reduce the&#13;
incidence of waterbome infections, particularly cholera. It would also support the construction of&#13;
adequate systems for the disposal of human feces, (latrines) in order to reduce the transmission of&#13;
infectious diseases and the contamination of food and agricultural products.&#13;
Subcomponent I. B. Essential Clinical Care&#13;
2.13  Subprojects would be selected by the jurisdictions from among four main categories:&#13;
1. Reproductive Health&#13;
2. Child Health and School Health&#13;
3. Infectious and Vector Borne Diseases&#13;
4. Chronic Diseases, Palliative Treatment, Consultations&#13;
The above programs would be selected by each jurisdiction on the basis of the epidemiological profile&#13;
and health priorities (para. 2.7). Priority interventions in the clinical package are: (a) reproductive&#13;
health, which includes prenatal and delivery care, treatment of gynecological and obstetric&#13;
emergencies, provision of family planning devices, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and&#13;
detection of breast and cervico-uterine cancer; (b) child health and school health, which would treat&#13;
acute respiratory diseases, diarrhea, rash and fever illnesses and meningitis;  (c) treatment of&#13;
infectious and vector borne diseases such as tuberculosis, intestinal infections, parasitic diseases,&#13;
mycosis, hepatitis, pneumonia, genito-urinary infections, leprosy and where endemic, malaria,&#13;
dengue, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease and onchocercosis; (d) treatment of chronic diseases, limited&#13;
or palliative treatment and consultations for conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma,&#13;
AIDS, arthritis, pain management, and treatment for traumas and acute abdominal conditions. Each&#13;
cluster would also include the consultations necessary to determine whether a patient's condition is to&#13;
be included into the package.&#13;
2.14 The Basic Health Care component would finance the health infrastructure, manpower and&#13;
outreach facilities necessary to carry out the above mentioned activities in the target areas and to&#13;
deliver the public health package. More specifically, proposals presented by health jurisdictions would&#13;
include financing for: (a) construction, upgrading, expansion and maintenance of physical facilities&#13;
such as health posts and centers, second-level hospitals, birth centers and community health clinics&#13;
located in small rural and other underserved areas. The selection of infrastructure investments (new&#13;
construction or rehabilitation) would need to be justified in terms of cost-effective investrnents in&#13;
comparison to alternative ways of delivering the respective basic health care package, (e.g.,&#13;
contracting with private or other public health care providers, existing local government facilities,&#13;
etc.); (b) basic equipment for first and second level care, such as medical instruments (surgical&#13;
instruments, scales, delivery tables and instrument packages for midwives); (c) essential office&#13;
equipment; (d) procurement of essential pharmaceuticals (according to essential drug list), family&#13;
planning devices; (e) laboratory equipment; (f) radio equipment to improve referrals; (g) vehicles,&#13;
such as ambulances, fully equipped four wheel drive medical mobile units, bicycles and motorcycles;&#13;
and (h) technical training, incentives for hardship posts, incremental fixed-tern staff, including&#13;
Primary Care Technicians (TAPS), community volunteers and midwives (Annex 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.15  Incentives: Given the difficulty in recruiting and particularly retaining health care professionals in&#13;
remote rural areas, this subcomponent would provide financing for hardship incentives on a declining&#13;
basis. These incentives would be used to attract and retain recent medical school graduates (pasantes&#13;
medicos), nurses and TAPS by offering a premium in addition to their base salary which together&#13;
represents more than they would earn in urban areas. The incentives would be controlled and awarded by&#13;
the community based on their level of satisfaction with the service provided. The operational manual will&#13;
specify the selection criteria, incentive amounts and procedures to be followed by the municipality (para.&#13;
2.16). This process would be supervised by the respective SHA.&#13;
2.16  Each year, the selected health jurisdictions would prepare an investment plan, based on the&#13;
epidemiological profile of the population. However, investments in infrastructure and equipment&#13;
would be subject to a detailed diagnostic infrastructure review, before their inclusion in the proposal&#13;
(para 2.7). For the first year, subproject proposals of nine states were reviewed by the Bank during&#13;
appraisal and considered satisfactory. The proposals of two states33 will be presented during the first&#13;
year of operation. The appraisal mission also reviewed an outline of the operational manual (Annex&#13;
9). At negotiations, it was agreed that the project would be implemented and subprojects submitted,&#13;
approved, supervised and evaluated accordivng to critenia defined in the Operational Manual (pam.&#13;
3.1(a)). As a condition of loan effectiveness, the SSA will have put into effect the Operational&#13;
Manual satisfactory to the Bank (pam. 3.2(a)).&#13;
Component IU: Institutional Development and Decentralization: (US$61.1 million or 13.8 permt of&#13;
total costs, induding oingencies)&#13;
A. Transfer of Planning and Budgeting Functions to the States&#13;
B. Human Resources Development&#13;
2.17 This component would strengthen and decentralize management and services of the SSA, with&#13;
special emphasis of the needs of the 32 states and 234 health jurisdictions. It would make available the&#13;
support systems and processes required for effective decision making at all levels of the health care&#13;
system (para. 1.18). It would support the SHAs to: (a) improve the planning and execution of budgets&#13;
through more efficient financial management; (b) support training of state managers to better identify&#13;
and respond more rapidly to epidemiological problems using management information systems (MIS)&#13;
data for decision-making; (c) improve the coverage and quality of sanitary regulation and health&#13;
services accreditation; (d) reduce losses of drugs and materials through improved procurement, stock&#13;
management and preventive maintenance; and (e) improve the overall quality of basic health care&#13;
service delivery. This component would also finance the training needed to strengthen the states' basic&#13;
information systems which complement the MIS financed under Component m. C. (paras. 2.31 to&#13;
2.39).&#13;
Sub-component II A. Transfer of Planning and Budgeting Functions to the States&#13;
2.18  The project would provide technical assistance and consulting services to help the SSA to&#13;
define the service functions to be transferred to the states and jurisdictions, respectively, with the&#13;
objective of improving efficiency, efficacy, and quality of service provision. The subcomponent would&#13;
prepare the states for the decentralization of functions from the federal to the state level, and transfer&#13;
33 Campeche and San Luis Potosi.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
responsibilities from the state to the jurisdictional level. It will ensure that the state and juiisdictional&#13;
health authorities are in a position to assume their new responsibilities.&#13;
2.19 The subcomponent would finance decentralization support units (DSUs) in each state, which&#13;
assist the SHAs in management training, facilitate consulting services and provide technical assistance&#13;
to define and implement new functions at the state levels. Specifically, DSUs would support: (i)&#13;
definition and adaptation of the new functions and responsibilities to be transferred to state and&#13;
jurisdictional levels; (ii) decentralization of operational and financial responsibilities from the federal to&#13;
the state and transfer of functions from the state to jurisdictional levels, including relevant positions of&#13;
the health budget; and (iii) assessment and adaptation of the policy and regulatory framework to&#13;
coordinate and eventually merge the services provided by the SSA and by IMSS-Solididad (paras.&#13;
1.5-1.6). A proposed set of specific functions to be transferred (such as: health budget, integral&#13;
supervision of health programs, procurement of drugs and medical supplies and civil works, staff&#13;
allocation, technical and managerial training, and sanitary regulation) was reviewed and found&#13;
acceptable by the appraisal mission. Al negotations the SSA presented a decentralization tinetable&#13;
specifying the functions to be transfened to the states, and it was agreed that the SSA would&#13;
cooperate with the states to ensure adherence to this timetable (pam. 3.1(b)).&#13;
Sub-component II. B. Human Resources Development:&#13;
1. Genemal Management TIaining&#13;
2. Data-for-Decision-Making (I)DM) Thining&#13;
3. Training for Management Information Systems (MIS)&#13;
2.20 This sub-component would focus on the human resources and manpower development needed&#13;
for planning, managing and implementing more efficient, high quality health services at the state,&#13;
jurisdictional and municipal levels. The overall objectives of this subcomponent are to improve the&#13;
capacity of state and jurisdictional staff to: (a) implement the decentralization of services; (b) plan,&#13;
execute and monitor budgets, procure goods and services, control logistics and stocks of drugs and&#13;
supplies; (c) manage human resources; and (d) identify and respond to epidemiological needs. The&#13;
sub-component would support three areas: (a) geneml management training; (b) data for decision-&#13;
making training; and (c) training for MIS.&#13;
2.21  (a) General Management Training: This training program would be directed to managers&#13;
responsible for developing health strategies, determining priority programs and establishing norms and&#13;
procedures, including for the basic health care package (para. 2.8).  (i) Training for senior&#13;
management: It would finance courses, seminars and study tours, in response to the need for&#13;
management skills of state health staff, directly responsible for managing newly decentralized functions&#13;
and for providing technical support to jurisdictions. It would also offer seminars on management of&#13;
organizational change and strategic planning, health sector reform, alternative health care delivery&#13;
systems, and altemative public and/or private financing schemes in countries of Latin America and/or&#13;
Europe' where health reform has already advanced. About 70 senior staff from both the SSA and the&#13;
SHAs would participate in this program. (ii) Training for state and jurisdictional officials: About&#13;
500 staff of both state and jurisdictional levels, directly involved in the implementation of the&#13;
decentralization process and sector modemization at state and jurisdictional levels would benefit from&#13;
the general management training during the life of the project. The implementation of this training&#13;
34 Specific coutitnes to be detenmined. Candidates are Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Spain, England, Genmany.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
program would be coordinated at the national level by the central PCU which, in cooperation with&#13;
other departnents in the SSA, would contract training institutions or consultant firms to carry out the&#13;
training. During appraisal, the mission reviewed the training program proposed for 1995 and found it&#13;
satisfactory. Duing negotiations, agreement was reached that the fina proposal for the CY 1996&#13;
traunng progran, including its content and cost, drm1t contrads for the taining hstitutions or&#13;
TORs for consultant firms to cany out the training would be submitted to the Bank for its eview by&#13;
December 31, 1995 (para. 3.1(c)).&#13;
2.22  (b) Data-for-Decision-Making (DDM) Training. lb define priority programs and improve&#13;
decision making, the SSA started a training program under the First Basic Health Care project, to&#13;
strengthen the management and technical capacity of state health services. It applied the concept of&#13;
total quality management CIQM)35 in obtaining, organizing and analyzing epidemiological information.&#13;
This sub-component would expand this program to those states not yet covered, in order to: (a)&#13;
increase the ability of decision makers at jurisdictional and state levels to use appropriate data for&#13;
setting health priorities, establishing policies, allocating resources, and managing programs in the&#13;
health sector; (b) help technical staff to manage information in an understandable and compelling&#13;
fashion; and (c) support the health information systems to improve data quality and access. This&#13;
training prgram  would benefit about 1,000 staff.  Linked with the National E4idemiological&#13;
Surveillance System (para 2.35), it would allow the state and jurisdictional health services to apply&#13;
management and decision-making sldlls to diagnose problems in programmatic areas, identify&#13;
solutions, prepare action plans, budget resources, implement decisions that are within their authority&#13;
and finally evaluate the effectiveness of actions taken or communicate recommendations for action to&#13;
authorities. SSA's General Directorate of Epidemiology (DGE) would be responsible for carrying out&#13;
the training program. Jointly with the PCU, the DGE would subcontract consulting firns or academic&#13;
institutions to assist in preparing and implementing the training modules. The DGE has prepared the&#13;
teaching materials and manuals and has experience in the implementation of this training, including in&#13;
distance based learning methodology in close collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control&#13;
and Prevention (CDC). The DGE would also be responsible for monitoring, supervising and&#13;
evaluating the application of the training program by the states and jurisdictions. At the appraisal, the&#13;
Bank reviewed the training program and the draft contract for the training program starting in 1995,&#13;
and found it satisflactory.&#13;
2.23 (c) Training for MIS. In its sector strategy, the new administration is proposing the&#13;
decentralization and modemization of the SSA, granting states and jurisdictions greater management&#13;
and decision making power (para. 1.28). As decentralization takes place, new management tools and&#13;
information systems will be needed.  lb implement those, the project would support technical&#13;
assistance for training technical staff at state and jurisdictional levels in MIS, and it would finance&#13;
related operations to be agreed upon in the annual investment plans (i.e., seminars on epidemiology,&#13;
sanitary regulation, services administration, hospital management, budget preparation, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of indicators). The actual demand under this training category will vary from state to state&#13;
in function of the existing technical capacity and assessment of specific local needs. The hardware for&#13;
the different MIS modules would be financed under Component m (paras. 2.31 - 2.39).&#13;
2.24 The proposed MIS will require training in the following areas: (a) Health Services: for&#13;
allocating and managing resources, preparing budgets, monitoring and evaluating indicators,&#13;
35 Total Quafity Management (TIQM) was described for tie first time by W.E. Denung (M1T, 1992). Its concet centers on extenal&#13;
customer satisfaction and dte role of intenal customers in an orgaizataon as the key to improve producivity and efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
establishing financing mechanisms, accounting and controlling funds for health services; (b)&#13;
Procurement and Stock Control: for procurement methods, bidding documents, procurement&#13;
financing, stock control, logistics and distribution of drugs and medical supplies; (c) Epidemiological&#13;
Surveillance: for management of data on morbidity, mortality, program coverage, demographic&#13;
registration; (d) Hospital Management and Accounting: for training hospital managers to improve&#13;
management and decision making within the SSA's hospital network; and (e) Sanitary Regulation: for&#13;
the coordination, implementation and quality control of sanitary regulations in states and jurisdictions.&#13;
About 2,000 staff from the state health services would participate in these training programs during the&#13;
life of the project.&#13;
Component m. Modernization and Restructuring of the SSA   (US$47.0 miion or 10.6 p t of&#13;
total cost indludig contangenes)&#13;
(A) Restructuring of the SSA&#13;
(B) iblicy and Operational Studies and Pilot Tlesting:&#13;
(C) Management InformationSystem   MIS)&#13;
(D) Project Administration, Monitoring and Impact Evaluation.&#13;
2.25  While the second component was geared to the institutional development in the states and&#13;
jurisdictions, this third component would support policy, institutional and operational reforms of the&#13;
central level SSA. It would support the framework for the Government's decentralization strategy,&#13;
which, inter alia, intends to merge services for the uninsured population and make the 32 states&#13;
responsible for their administration (para. 1.26). The component would also upgrade the hardware for&#13;
the health sector MIS (para. 2.38). The SSA's institutional mission and functions would be redefined&#13;
to regain its sector leadership role while transferring many administrative and service delivery tasks to&#13;
the states. Specifically, this component would support the SSA to concentrate on: (a) formulating&#13;
national health sector policies, strategies, programs, and standards to ensure a comprehensive and&#13;
harmonious development of the National Health System; (b) monitoring and evaluating the impact of&#13;
these policies and strategies whether they meet the objectives and targets defined for the health sector;&#13;
(c) improving hospital management and establishing standards for services and accreditation of health&#13;
facilities; (d) enhancing budget planning, evaluation, auditing and supervision functions; and (e)&#13;
revising current norms and regulations to boost flexibility and efficiency of health care services in the&#13;
32 states.&#13;
Sub-component m. A. Restructuring of the SSA&#13;
2.26  This subcomponent would have two phases. During the frst phase, which akeady started&#13;
during project preparation, the SSA jointly with consultants is (a) defining its new mission, objectives&#13;
and functions, (b) proposing a new organizational model, specifying human resources, infrastructure,&#13;
technology and the legal framework needed for its operation and (c) identifying the requirements for&#13;
training and MIS to support the modernization and decentralization process. This first phase was&#13;
initiated in November of 1994 and will be concluded by the end of 1995.&#13;
2.27  The second phase consists in the implementation of the studies findings after approving an&#13;
action plan. Expected results would include the implementation of: (a) the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework for modifying the internal structure of the SSA, in light of the decentralization; (b) the&#13;
procedures to improve the SSA's capacity to fonnulate, monitor and evaluate policies, programs, and&#13;
norms; and (c) the human resources training program and skills mix. The subcomponent would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
finance training workshops on health reform, health financing and resource allocation, and training in&#13;
other topics to facilitate the restructuring process. Specifically, it would finance about 60 person-&#13;
months of technical assistance to help the SSA to implement the action plan, in addition to equipment&#13;
and materials. Based on the diagnostic survey of the existing MIS, carried out in the first phase, the&#13;
component would finance its modernization to facilitate the information flow within SSA departments&#13;
and between the center, the states and the jurisdictions.  The MIS would facilitate policy and&#13;
operational decisions and speed up the response to problems presented at different service levels. The&#13;
design of the required network for both central and state levels, as well as the purchase of the required&#13;
hard and software, would be financed under the proposed loan (para. 2.31 - 2.39). During appraisal,&#13;
the mission reviewed the draft terms of reference for the MIS and a model contract for the first phase&#13;
survey and found them satisfactory. A pre-investment assessment and feasibility study has started.&#13;
Sub-component m  B. Policy and Operational Studies and Pilot Testing&#13;
2.28 Under this sub-component, the project would support policy and operational studies, pilot&#13;
testing of alternative health delivery and financing models which would allow the SSA to define new&#13;
policies and strategies for the health sector, as well as to improve the efficiency and quality of service&#13;
delivery. It would be implemented under the auspices of the General Directorate of Evaluation and the&#13;
General Directorate of Economic Studies of the SSA, which would subcontract with academic&#13;
institutions or consulting firms (such as the National Institute of Public Health - INSP, FUNSALUD).&#13;
The project would finance technical assistance, equipment, and implementation costs of the results of&#13;
these studies and pilot models.&#13;
2.29 Policy Studies. Further to the recommendations to be developed by the current study' on the&#13;
new role and functions of the SSA, there are several other policy issues that need to be addressed in the&#13;
health sector, such as: capacity, cost, quality and efficiency of the main groups of health service&#13;
providers, particularly the social security systems, the private sector and alternative financier/provider&#13;
arrangements that could be adopted to optimize the provision and utilization of health services. The&#13;
studies grouped under this sub-component have the purpose of providing a decision maling basis for&#13;
administrative, legal and financial requirements of health reform. The proposed policy studies would&#13;
cover the following topics: (a) technical regulation and efficient regulatory instruments; (b) alternative&#13;
financing mechanisms for purchase or sale of services to third parties, including the private sector; (c)&#13;
introduction of better health budgeting mechanisms for a more equitable resource allocation to the&#13;
states and better evaluation of output targets and indicators; and (d) feasibility study on public-private&#13;
joint ventures for vaccine production and quality control. Outlines of the TORs for these studies were&#13;
discussed during appraisal and are available in the project files. Additional topics could be identified,&#13;
presented and agreed upon during the annual project reviews.&#13;
2.30 Pilot Tests. The project would support pilot testing of those institutional, policy or operational&#13;
models that the Government suggests to adopt as part of the modernization of the health sector. The&#13;
following topics could be subject to pilot design and testing: (a) alternative models of health care&#13;
provision involving communities, municipalities or non-governmental organizations; (b) purchasing&#13;
health care services and support services from the private sector; (c) provision of cost effective health&#13;
care packages through the social insurance sector; and (d) incentives models (educational, bonuses,&#13;
clinic group incentives) to improve productivity and quality among the health staff of public&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
institutions. Proposals for these studies were discussed during appraisal and outlines of TORs are&#13;
available in the project files. At negotiations, the SSA submitted draft proposals for polcy studies&#13;
and pilot tests. It was agreed with the SSA that (i) fial TORs for policy stuides and pilot tests for&#13;
implementation during CY 1996 would be furmished to the Bank no later than December 31, 1995;&#13;
and (u) for the subsequent years, proposals for policy studies and pilot tests would be presented by&#13;
the SSA and reviewed with the Bank during the joint annual project review meetings (pam. 3.1(d)).&#13;
Sub-component El. C. Management Information Systems:&#13;
1. Health Services Administration&#13;
2. Procurement and Stock Control&#13;
3. Epidemiological Surveillance&#13;
4. Health Care Facilities&#13;
5. Sanitary Regulations&#13;
2.31  The improvement of the quality and timeliness of the MIS would be a prerequisite to improve&#13;
the delivery of basic health care and successful decentralization of services. The objective of this sub-&#13;
component is to strengthen the existing MIS and to introduce new systems for health services,&#13;
budgeting and financial management, hospital administration and program evaluation to improve the&#13;
decision making capacities of all levels in the SSA (para. 1.19-1.20). The sub-component would also&#13;
strengthen and expand systems developed under the First Basic Health Care project. In order to&#13;
encourage consistency and avoid duplications, the proposed project would undertake, as a first step, an&#13;
inventory and assessment of existing procedures, hardware and software. In a second step, the design&#13;
and implementation of additional modules would be financed by the proposed project.&#13;
2.32  The MIS would consider the specific needs of the central level, states and jurisdictions and of&#13;
health care facilities. The six proposed modules are: (a) epidemiological surveillance; (b) health&#13;
services administration; (c) human resources administration; (d) financing, budgeting, accounting and&#13;
evaluation for health care facilities; (e) pharmaceutical procurement, stock control and distribution; and&#13;
(f) sanitary regulation.&#13;
2.33 Health Services Administration MIS: This first module would support the development of a&#13;
national health services information system. The experience gained by the SSA's General Directorate&#13;
of Statistics (DGS) in processing and analyzing national data will be used to provide guidance for&#13;
states participating in the project in structuring their own data networks. The capacity for collection,&#13;
analysis and interpretation of data on resource allocation and management, budgeting, financing&#13;
mechanisms, accounting and control of funds and use of infrastructure will be developed to foster&#13;
decision-making at state, jurisdictional and municipal levels. This system would require the network&#13;
integration at all levels and would connect jurisdictions and state levels with national systems.&#13;
2.34 Procurement and Stock Control MIS: The second module would build on a procurement&#13;
and stock control system developed and tested in the ongoing health project and will be expanded into&#13;
the new project states. The respective computer software allows budgets, disbursements and stocks to&#13;
be monitored. The software for pharmaceutical supply system developed in the Federal District wiU&#13;
be extended to all states to enhance logistics and distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.&#13;
In addition, a new standardized software package for bidding, comparison purchases and direct&#13;
purchases would be introduced. Eventually the system would be expanded to accommodate all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
accounting data handled at the state levels. This system would be implemented at the state levels and&#13;
linked to the national level.&#13;
2.35  Epideniological Surveillance MIS:  The third module would finance an epidemiological&#13;
surveillance system to enhance the capture, processing, analysis and interpretation of epidemiological&#13;
and biostatistical data on morbidity, mortality and program and service coverage for the purpose of&#13;
public health decision making at the national and local levels. The information system would be&#13;
closely linked to the "Data for Decision-Making (DDM)" and management training programs which&#13;
would be implemented and supervised by the SSA's DGE. A number of state staff were already&#13;
trained during the ongoing project in DDM. The system would be implemented both at the&#13;
jurisdictional and state levels, the central level systems would be upgraded.&#13;
2.36 Health Facilities MIS: The fourth module would finance the design and implementation of&#13;
systems to improve data management on hospital production, quality, cost accounting systems, and&#13;
financial management. This system would be introduced in all third level and in selected second level&#13;
hospitals and be linked to the state systems.&#13;
2.37 Sanitary Regulations MIS: The fifth module would facilitate infonnation management and&#13;
decision making for sanitary regulation and quality control of food and beverage processing businesses&#13;
and the marketing of food products, beverages and medicines. This system will strengthen the states'&#13;
abilities to monitor and effectively implement sanitary health control measures based on speedier and&#13;
more efficient handling of data and will strengthen the task of sanitary inspectors in conjunction with&#13;
public health laboratories. This system would be implemented at the state levels with datalinks to the&#13;
central level.&#13;
2.38  For implementation of the five modules of the MIS, the project would finance the purchase of&#13;
computers and the accessories (modems, communication facilities) needed to install a statewide MIS37&#13;
and to link it both to jurisdictional, state, and national levels. Before computer equipment is assigned,&#13;
state health authorities will appoint staff, responsible for system implementation at all levels. Apart&#13;
from the purchase of hardware, the component would finance (a) temporary staff for the installation&#13;
and initial start-up of the system; (b) licensed commercial software for word processing, spreadsheets,&#13;
graphics, data bases, geographic information systems and statistical processing; (c) additional&#13;
telephone lines and equipment as needed for transmission of data between districts and state capitals&#13;
and to the central SSA; and (d) custom software development as necessary for the implementation of&#13;
the MIS modules.&#13;
2.39  During the first year of the project, the MIS will be implemented only in the state capitals,&#13;
linked to selected jurisdictions. In subsequent years the remaining jurisdictions would be included&#13;
according to their absorption capacity. All jurisdictions would be incorporated by the end of the fourth&#13;
year of the project. During negotations, agreement was reached that no disbursement for computer&#13;
equipment shall be made in any state unless a feasibility study has been completed for that state and&#13;
the Bank has approved the expenditure (pam. 3.1(e)).&#13;
37 In the case of the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, Hidalgo and Oaxaca, which currently have a more advanced computer inrructure&#13;
than the other sates, resource requirements will be lower&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
Sub-component HI. R  Project Administration, Monitoring and Impact Evaluation&#13;
2.40 This sub-component would support project administration through the central and state project&#13;
coordinating units (PCUs and SPCUs, respectively), project monitoring and supervision assistance,&#13;
continuous process evaluation, periodic impact evaluation and final evaluation for each component of&#13;
the proposed project. The PCU together with the General Directorate for Evaluation of the SSA&#13;
would be responsible for managing the evaluation activities by sub-contracting individual tasks to&#13;
national and international consultants, fimns or academic institutions, in accordance with specific&#13;
TORs. During appraisal, the mission reviewed performance, outcome and policy indicators and&#13;
(Annex 10) and found them satisfactory. Processes for project monitoring and evaluation will be&#13;
included in the Operational Manual. The PCU would also provide technical assistance to the states as&#13;
required to implement the evaluation designs and to measure effective udlization of the resources to be&#13;
provided by the loan.&#13;
2.41  The project intends to positively impact health conditions of the target population through: (i) a&#13;
novel approach of selecting cost-effective basic health care services to be offered to the uninsured&#13;
population (component I); (ii) institutional development aimed to assist in the decentralization of health&#13;
services to the states (component II); and (iii) restructuring and modernize the SSA, to lead and reform&#13;
the health sector (component III). Accordingly, the evaluation would need to measure three different&#13;
aspects: (i) project impact on the health status of the beneficiary population; (ii) effectiveness of the&#13;
state health services in carrying out the specific interventions under a more decentralized regime; and&#13;
(iii) the impact of the institutional development, decentralization and reform processes on the central&#13;
level SSA to oversee a modem health system. It is also necessary to monitor the execution of the&#13;
project according to the implementation plan, appraise success and failures and analyze lessons&#13;
learned. Data for process indicators and impact indicators will be obtained from the M[S at the states&#13;
and central level SSA, through routine epidemiological and demographic information, and through&#13;
special surveys and studies, identified, discussed and approved during annual implementation reviews&#13;
(Annex 10). Regarding components II and m, evaluation would focus on decentralization of health&#13;
services, effective management of health resources at the state level, the restructuring of the SSA, and&#13;
the monitoring and of policy indicators (Annex 10). The evaluation plan would also assess the shift&#13;
from input-based to outcome based planning and budgeting, and the extent to which the findings of&#13;
studies and analyses are used at the state and local level for decision making and rapid response to&#13;
local health needs. At negotiations, the SSA submitted an evaluation scheme of subproject&#13;
inplementation, which will be part of the Operational Manual. It was agreed a project progress&#13;
report wiU be presented every year by the SSA to the Bank at the joint annual projed review&#13;
meetings (paiu. 3.1(f)).&#13;
D. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
2.42 Project Costs. The proposed project costs, which were reviewed at project appraisal, have&#13;
been estimated at US$443.4 million, including physical and price contingencies. Investment costs&#13;
amount to about 54 percent of base costs and incremental recurrent costs account for about 46 percent.&#13;
Project costs were estimated at October 1994 price levels. Given the current economic situation and&#13;
factoring in an anticipated project launch in January 1996, an estiinated inflation rate of 52 percent was&#13;
used between data collection and project start. An inflation rate of 2.2 percent per annum was used&#13;
for the period 1996 to 2000, and an exchange rate of 6.0 nuevos pesos (N$) per US dollar (Annex 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
2.43   Estimated rehabilitation and construction costs for SSA health facilities are based on average&#13;
contract and costs analysis carried out under the ongoing project. Estimated contact costs for medical,&#13;
computing, office equipment and vehicles are based on prices quoted in recent international&#13;
competitive bids. Estimates for technical assistance and studies are based on current rates for local and&#13;
foreign experts, and cost estimates for training are based on costing standards prepared by the SSA.&#13;
2.44 Project Financing. The proposed loan of US$310.0 million would finance 69.9 percent of&#13;
total project costs (net of taxes and duties), which would represent 100 percent of foreign exchange and&#13;
65.4 percent of local expenditures. The remaining US$133.4 million would be financed by the&#13;
Mexican Govermment over the 5 years of the project. Retroactive financing of up to US$3.1 million (1&#13;
percent of the total proposed loan amount) would be provided to help cover eligible start-up&#13;
expenditures for technical assistance and other eligible expenditures.&#13;

2.45   Financing for the proposed project would be included under the SSA's standard budget&#13;
category  (Ramo X71); however, funds would  be channeled  directly  to  the SPCUs and health&#13;
jurisdictions and municipalities through the use of a direct budget allocation mechanism (Annex 3).&#13;
Counterpart funds for the project would flow from the Federal Treasury's IDB-IBRD line of credit&#13;
through NAFIN directly to a commercial bank in each state. The release of funds would be authorized&#13;
by the SPCUs in accordance with the authorized annual investment plan. Details on the operation of&#13;
this mechanism would be included in the Operational Manual. In order to promote the sustainability&#13;
of the project, the state and comnunity levels would contribute at least 10 percent of the program&#13;
costs, excluding salaries financed by the executing agency and states.&#13;

2.46 Incremental Recurrent Costs. The project would add an estimated US$41.4 million average&#13;
annual recurrent expenditures. Incremental operating costs for the first year are estimated at US$24.3&#13;
million. In 1993, total recurrent expenditures for 9 project statesm were estimated at US$389 million&#13;
for health care services provided by the SSA and IMSS-Solidandad. Average annual incremental costs&#13;
would remain below 10 percent of total operating expenditures by the end of the project; first year&#13;
costs would amount to just over five percent of the total project costs. *The annual increases in&#13;
recurrent expenditures would be offset by:  (i) counterpart financing from  state and municipal&#13;
govermments to be laid out in the implementation agreements with the states; (ii) Government's will to&#13;
address overall the current inequitable distribution of the health budget among the states; (iii) better&#13;
targeting of the SSA budget within the states, focusing on the most cost effective interventions in the&#13;
poorest areas. Such strategies would be also supported by the proposed project supporting the&#13;
decentralization of functions and services and providing technical assistance for resource mobilization&#13;
and cost recovery.&#13;

2.47 The project would include procurement of civil works for new construction, replacement and&#13;
rehabilitation of medical facilities for primary and secondary care in the project states. The project&#13;
would also finance the procurement of medical, office, radio communication, and computing&#13;
equipment for the MIS, office and lab furniture, drugs and supplies, ambulances, fully equipped&#13;
mobile health units, motorcycles and bicycles, printing of health education booklets in indigenous&#13;
languages and other manuals, information campaigns, studies and technical assistance services.&#13;
Procurement of goods and works would be carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines (January&#13;
1995). States participating in the First Basic Health Care project have acquired experience in&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB) and lessons learned would be transferred to the SPCUs for all&#13;
ICB and limited international bidding (IJB) contracts. The project states would be supported by&#13;
experienced staff in the federal PCU. Specific procurement and disbursement procedures would be&#13;
incorporated into the Operational Manual for distribution in all participating states.  Technical&#13;
assistance and training will be made available to all participating agencies at central, state,&#13;
jurisdictional, and municipal levels (para. 2.20).&#13;
2.48 All procurement under ICB and LITB for medical equipment and supplies, MIS equipment, and&#13;
drugs will be done by the PCU and SPCUs, following standard Bank procedures, to take advantage of&#13;
the economies of scale, and to ensure the quality of the goods and services procured and their&#13;
consistency with the project objectives. Other procurement of small miscellaneous goods would be&#13;
done by the jurisdictions through national shopping. For ICB, the PCUs would use the standard&#13;
bidding documents (SBDs) issued by the Bank, with such modifications as agreed by the Bank to be&#13;
necessary for the purpose for the project. For national competitive bidding (NCB), SBDs as agred by&#13;
38 excluding Campeche and San Llis Potosi&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
the Bank with the Government of Mexico would be used. For the purpose of comparing foreign and&#13;
local bids for goods dunng ICB evaluation, domestic manufacturers would be allowed a margin of&#13;
preference in accordance with Appendix 2 of Bank guidelines. The Procurement Table below shows&#13;
project costs breakdown by procurement method.   During appraisal, detailed procurement&#13;
arrangements were discussed and agreed. Due to the demand-driven nature of the project, specific&#13;
procurement methods and packaging anrangements, for each category of procurement, would be&#13;
selected after subprojects have been approved during the annual review process.&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
2.49 The project would finance new construction and rehabilitation works totaling US$45.2 million,&#13;
or 10.2 percent of total projects costs. Annex 12 describes detailed procurement arrangements for&#13;
contracting civil works in the project. It is not anticipated that there will be any ICB for works within&#13;
the project.&#13;
2.50 Under the state-managed model (Annex 12), the project would finance the procurement of&#13;
small-size new construction, extensions or rehabilitation or purchases of construction materials with&#13;
contract amounts equal to or more than US$350,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$23.7 million&#13;
under NCB; lumpsum fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of three quotations would be used for&#13;
contracts estimated to cost less than US$350,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$9.1 million. If&#13;
feasible, the PCUs would group contracts in packages expected to cost not less than US$60,000.&#13;
Under the community-based model, the project would finance procurement of small works for&#13;
primary care service facilities, estimated to cost less than US$60,000, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$12.2 million.  Jurisdictions and municipalities would procure these works through direct&#13;
contracting with local health committees or with small local contractors. The project would finance&#13;
technical assistance to enable the jurisdictions to prepare technical proposals and budgets and to&#13;
supervise implementation. Detailed arrangements for the supervision of works are included in Annex&#13;
12. During appraisal, technical assistance plans to support jurisdictions and terms of reference to&#13;
contract consultants from the private sector, including the development of a self-help handbook, were&#13;
reviewed and agreed upon. Also, during appraisal, it was agreed that the flow of actions and control&#13;
mechanisms to supervise works under the community model, would be included in the Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;

Goods&#13;
2.51 Equipment and Furniture. The project would finance procurement of a diverse set of goods&#13;
totaling US$104.7 million or 23.6 percent of project costs. Since the bulk of equipment purchases&#13;
would be distributed among the states through the subprojects approved each year, and would be&#13;
subject to the phasing in of new jurisdictions, there will be few opportunities to package purchases,&#13;
valued at US$300,000 or more. Therefore, whenever possible, packages of equipment and furniture&#13;
and miscellaneous goods valued at US$100,000 or more and less than or equal to US$350,000, up to&#13;
an aggregate of US$13.4 million, not expected to attract foreign bidders, would be procured by the&#13;
SPCUs, using NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Other goods costing less than US$100,000&#13;
would be procured by the jurisdictions and municipalities, on the basis of comparison of price&#13;
quotations from at least three qualified suppliers (national shopping), up to an aggregate of US$1.3&#13;
million.&#13;
2.52  Medical Equipment  The project would finance the procurement of medical equipment,&#13;
estimated to cost US$15.9 million. Most of which would be packaged in contracts of more than&#13;
US$100,000, to be procured by the central SPCUs following LIB among manufacturers with established&#13;
servicing facilities in Mexico. During appraisal it was agreed that procurement of medical equipment&#13;
would be limited to primary and secondary care. For contracts valued at less than US$100,000,&#13;
jurisdictions and municipalities would procure these items under national shopping, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$1.6 million.&#13;
2.53 Management Information Systems. The project would finance the implementation of MIS,&#13;
including hardware and software (paras. 2.31-2.39), estimated to cost US$26.1 million. Consulting&#13;
services for the design would also be financed under the project. All equipment for the information&#13;
systems would be procured by the central PCU following 1IB procedures. During appraisal, terms of&#13;
reference for the feasibility study for the implementation of the information systems were reviewed&#13;
and agreed and are included in Annex 13.&#13;
2.54 Vehicles and Mobile Units. The project would finance the procurement of ambulances, four&#13;
wheel drive fully equipped mobile health units, motorcycles and bicycles, up to an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$40.5 million. ICB procedures would be used to procure ambulances and mobile units;&#13;
however, due to the limitations imposed by the phasing-in mechanism of jurisdictions, other tranwsport&#13;
equipment may be procured by national shopping, up to an aggregate limit of US$3.4 million.&#13;
2.55 Printed Materials. The project would finance printed materials such as manuals, handbooks,&#13;
and training materials, estimated to cost approximately US$7.5 million, and would be procured&#13;
thrugh national shopping procedures.&#13;
2.56 Consultants, Studies, Technical Assistance, and Information Campaigns. The project&#13;
would finance a total of approximately US$78.1 million, or 17.6 percent of project costs for&#13;
consultants services. The project would finance the design and production of relevant materials in&#13;
health information campaigns, estimated to cost approximately US$30.2 million. Contracts for these&#13;
services would be awarded, at the state level, on the basis of the most creative, comprehensive and&#13;
cost-effective solutions to the terms of reference, under a specific fixed budget for each campaign, and&#13;
would include the production and reproduction of both electronic and printed media. Individual&#13;
consultants and consultants firns would be hired following Bank Guidelines for Consultants (August&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
1981).' During appraisal, programs for technical assistance to support jurisdictions, municipalities,&#13;
SPCUs and central PCU were reviewed and agreed. During appraisal, it was agreed that for contracts&#13;
with individual consultants and firms, the project would use the standard invitation packages and&#13;
contracts agreed by the Bank for Mexico.&#13;
2.57 Drugs and Medical Supplies. Drugs and medical supplies included in the basic package of&#13;
the SSA, totaling approximately US$54.3 million would be financed on a declining basis and procured&#13;
by the SPCUs, in packages of US$150,000 or more, through L1B from a list of qualified suppliers, up&#13;
to an aggregate amount of US$48.9 million. For purchases of less than US$150,000 shopping&#13;
procedures would be used by the jurisdictions and municipalities to procure these items, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$5.4 million.&#13;
2.58 Maintenance. The project includes incremental maintenance costs, with estimated contract&#13;
values of approximately US$6.8 million but would be entirely financed by the SHAs.&#13;
2.59  Other Costs Not Involving Pmrement4    Approximately 34.4 percent of project costs or&#13;
approximately US$152.5 million, would not involve procurement and include (a) incremental fixed-&#13;
term technical staff hired under the project to support the delivery of the basic package and to staff the&#13;
central PCU and SPCUs, (b) incentives, (c) travel costs and per diems, and (d) other recurrent&#13;
operational costs, including those of the PCU and SPCUs. Incremental fixed-term staff and&#13;
operational expenses would be financed on a declining basis.&#13;
2.60 Prior Review. Prior review by the Bank of procurement procedures and documentation would&#13;
be required for (a) items for which statements of expenditure are not applicable, (b) all tender&#13;
packages and contracts for ICB and LIB, and (c) the first tender package and related contracts for NCB&#13;
for each participating state. Although the level of Bank review of procurement in investment&#13;
categories is low (approximately 50 percent) due to the demand-driven nature of the project, it would&#13;
be compensated through: (i) cost comparison of similar subprojects in the project states to be prepared&#13;
by the PCU; (ii) annual review of subprojects submitted to the Advisory Committee (see Annex 14)&#13;
by the jurisdictions and municipalities and the close physical supervision to be done by the private&#13;
sector consultants at central and state level, (iii) during random ex-post reviews to be conducted of&#13;
subprojects by Bank supervision missions, including field visits and review of subproject&#13;
documentation, and (iv) periodic physical audits conducted by extemal auditors. TORs for technical&#13;
assistance and studies would be subject to ex-wne review by the Bank. Documentation for contracts&#13;
with consultants' firms, valued above US$100,000 and for individual consultants, valued above&#13;
US$50,000, as well as all those of critical nature, would be reviewed ex-ante by the Bank under the&#13;
special arangement for the autonomous limit (lbmte aut6nomo) agreed with NAFIN. All supporting&#13;
documentation will be retained by the PCU and SPCUs. During appraisal it was agreed that&#13;
procedures for prior and ex-ante review would be incorporated in the Operational Manual.&#13;
2.61 Country Procurement Assessment. No recent Country Procurement Assessment on Mexico&#13;
is available. However, Mexico's procurement regulations (Ley de Adquisiciones y Contrataciones,&#13;
January 1994), clearly authorize, as a special provision, application of procurement procedures of&#13;
39 Bank Guideines for dte Use of Conulat by Worid Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency&#13;
40 Inremental staff and operating costs are covered imder the SSA budget line item as follows: 1200 (personal transitorio); 1300&#13;

F.  DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
2.62 The proposed project would be implemented over a peiiod of approximately five years and is&#13;
expected to be completed by December 31, 2000 and close by June 30, 2001. The proceeds of the&#13;
loan would be disbursed over a 5 year period as shown in Annex 8. The loans' funds would be&#13;
disbursed as follows: (a) civil works, 70 percent of expenditures for new construction, expansion and&#13;
rehabilitation; and (b) medical, office and computer equipment for the MIS, furniture, vehicles,&#13;
mobile health units, printed materials and other goods 100 percent of foreign CIF or CIP expenditures,&#13;
100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 87 percent for locally procured goods.&#13;
Proceeds of the loan would also be disbursed for training, consultants, studies, technical assistance and&#13;
information campaigns at 100 percent. To help the Government absorb operating costs, the Bank's&#13;
contribution for incremental recurrent costs would total US$77.5 million over the life of the project.&#13;
Incremental recurrent costs would be comprised of salaries of incremental fixed-term technical staff&#13;
hired under the project; incentives; drugs and medical supplies; and miscellaneous operating costs,&#13;
travel and subsistence for supervision activities carried out by the PCU and SPCUs and participating&#13;
jurisdictions and the cost of the PCU and SPCUs. These costs would be financed on a declining rate&#13;
in the following manner: 87 percent for pharmaceuticals and consumable medical supplies up to&#13;
US$8.2 million, 66 percent up to US$15.0 million and 33 percent thereafter. Other incremental&#13;
operating costs would also be financed on a declining basis as follows: 87 percent up to US$25.6&#13;
million, 66 percent up to 48.5 million and 33 percent thereafter. Retractive financing of up to&#13;
US$3.1 million (1 percent of the total loan amount) would be provided to help cover eligible start-up&#13;
expenditure for technical assistance made on or after November 21, 1994 for which budget has been&#13;
allocated.&#13;
2.63 Withdrawal applications would be fully documented except for goods and equipment contracts&#13;
of less than US$350,000, for consultant contracts with individuals of less than US$50,000 and with&#13;
firms less than US$100,000, as well as civil works under US$2.0 million. Claims for expenditures&#13;
under contracts below those amounts and other expenditures not covered by a contract, such as&#13;
incentives, training costs, incremental salaries for fixed-term staff, travel allowances and other of&#13;
similar nature, would be disbursed against presentation of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). SOEs&#13;
should contain information as agreed upon with the Bank and supporting documentation related to&#13;
SOEs would be retained by the SPCUs for periodic inspection by the Bank and by external auditors.&#13;
In order to facilitate project implementation, information required for the SOEs prepared by SPCUs&#13;
would be available in the project data base (para. 2.67), updated monthly by the SPCUs based on&#13;
supportive documents received by jurisdictions and municipalities. All SOEs would be reviewed by&#13;
the central PCU and transmitted to NAFIN. New subprojects would be reviewed by the SSA and the&#13;
Bank on an annual basis during the joint annual reviews and after they have been approved by the&#13;
Advisory Committee.&#13;
2.64 A Special Account in US dollars with an initial deposit of US$13.0 million would be established at&#13;
the Banco de Mexico. The maximum authorized allocation would be US$20.0 million after aggregate&#13;
disbursements have reached US$37.0 million. The Special Account should be replenished monthly and&#13;
should be used for all transactions with a value of less than 20 percent of the amount advanced to the&#13;
Special Account. Normal documentation requirements apply, except that in addition, a copy of the bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
statement from the institution holding the account detailing the transactions made and reconciled by the&#13;
borrower would accompany each replenishment request.&#13;
2.65 The SSA would sign implementation agreements (Convenios) with each participating state. At&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached that loan proceeds shall not be spent for subprojed&#13;
implementation in any State unless that State has entered into and is complying with the tenns of&#13;
such implementation agreement (pam 3.1(g)).&#13;
2.66  Disbursement Procedures. Each executing agency, with the technical support from NAFIN,&#13;
would prepare the necessary documentation for prompt disbursement from the Special Account. SOEs&#13;
will be prepared on the basis of Cuentas por Liquidar Certificadas stamped by an appropriate financial&#13;
institution (i.e. canceled government payment checks) as evidence of actual expenditures made. NAFIN&#13;
would be in charge of overall coordination, logistical support and field supervision of the program.&#13;
During appraisal, the mechanism for flow of funds to participating states and jurisdictions was&#13;
reviewed an agreed.&#13;
G. ACCOUNTS AND AUDM&#13;
2.67 The PCU, in collaboration with SPCUs, would maintain records and accounts adequate to&#13;
reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources and expenditures in connection&#13;
with the execution of the project. These records would reflect the resources and expenditures in&#13;
connection with the execution of the entire project. Dunng negotiations, agreement was reached that&#13;
the Guarantor would cause to: (i) have the records and accounts for each fiscal year audied by&#13;
independent and qualfd auditors with a separate opinion provided on SOEs, in accordance with&#13;
generaly accepted auditng standards and procedures, and with the specific currnt undertanding&#13;
with the Mexican authoiies; (ii) furnish to the Bank, no later than six months after the end of&#13;
each year, a cenifed copy of the agreed audit repoils; (iii) furnish to the Bank such other&#13;
infonnaaion concemning the records and accounts as wel as the audit as the Bank wouldfrom tine&#13;
to time reasonably request. Terms of reference of the auditors would provide for a specific opinion&#13;
on the acceptabilty of the procurement procedures as weU as reasonabilty of costs paid (pxu&#13;
3.1(h)). For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Loan Account were made on&#13;
the basis of SOEs, and for all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals were made from the&#13;
Special Account, the PCU would ensure that records and accounts and supporting information&#13;
provided by SPCUs in the project data forms, as described in para. 2.63 above, are available for&#13;
review by Bank supervision missions and for NAFIN to allow timely performance of its obligations,&#13;
and to the independent auditors.&#13;
H. IMPMNTATION&#13;
2.68 Status of Project Preparation: The project has been jointly prepared by the SSA, which has&#13;
the primary implementation responsibility, the SHAs and the health jurisdictions of the target areas,&#13;
with periodic input from Bank missions. The Government, particularly SSA, SHCP, NAFIN and the&#13;
state and jurisdictional health authorities, have given full support to the project. The SSA has been&#13;
gaining valuable experience with the First Basic Health Care project. The SSA, the SHAs and&#13;
jurisdictions have already prepared first year subproject proposals for the Basic Health Care&#13;
component, which were jointly reviewed by the SSA and the Bank during appraisal. The additional&#13;
project states (Veracnrz, Michoacan, Yucatan, Zacatecas, Campeche, San Luis Potosi and Puebla)&#13;
benefited from the experience of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero and Hidalgo, where the First Basic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
Health Care project is currently under implementation. The SSA organized cross-fertlization seminars&#13;
with participating states and jurisdictions during project preparation. Consultants assisted the health&#13;
jurisdictions in project preparation. To sustain this transfer of technical capacity to health jurisdictions,&#13;
continuous technical assistance from the SSA, the SHAs and consultants has to be assured. The&#13;
appraisal mission reviewed and agreed upon: (a) jurisdictional project proposals for the first year" of&#13;
project implementation (b) proposals for infrastructure, training, studies and personnel; (c) sample&#13;
bidding documents; (d) building and biomedical equipment maintenance plans. Two states (Campeche&#13;
and San Luis Potosi, selected by the new Government in addition to the nine states originally&#13;
proposed at appraisal, will prepare subprojects in the second semester of 1995, to be approved for&#13;
implementation in 1996. In addition, it was agreed with the new administration to expand the second&#13;
component gradually (Institutional Development and Decentralization) to all 32 states. After the&#13;
economic crisis starting in December 1994, characterized by the peso devaluation and high inflation,&#13;
the project costs were reviewed and accordingly adjusted (para. 2.42).&#13;
2.69 Institutional Responsibilities and Implementation Arrangements: The executing agencies&#13;
for the proposed project are the SSA and the SHAs. The SSA is in charge of overall coordination,&#13;
logistical support and supervision of the project, and technical clearance of all subproject proposals&#13;
submitted by the states. The SSA would sign implementation agreements with the participating states&#13;
governments. The health jurisdictions, with the assistance of SHAs, will be the main executors of the&#13;
subprojects approved for financing under the proposed loan. PCUs and SPCUs would assist in the&#13;
oversight of project implementation, provide technical assistance to the states and jurisdictions, and&#13;
supervise and monitor project activities (paras. 2.72-2.73). Implementation responsibilities would&#13;
eventually be integrated into line departments of the SHAs, the central level would provide technical&#13;
assistance. Private banks, in the project states will receive authorized subproject funds, transfer them&#13;
to jurisdictions or provide for direct payment of contractors. As a condition of effectiveness, an&#13;
implementation agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, would be signed with at leastfive of the eleven&#13;
project states (para. 3.2(b)).&#13;
2.70 Project Administration: The project would be administered by a federal PCU and the&#13;
SPCUs in the participating project states. (a) federal PCU:4 The PCU will be responsible for&#13;
overseeing all implementation aspects of the project. The organization of the PCU draws from lessons&#13;
learned in the First Basic Health Care project, particularly the need for: (i) a lean organizational&#13;
structure that promotes empowerment and initiative at state and jurisdictional levels; (ii) emphasis on&#13;
analytical rigor and qualitative analysis to cope with changing epidemiological needs and a complex&#13;
institutional renovation process; (iii) a greater integration of the SPCUs within the health services&#13;
given the anticipated decentralization of functions to SHAs; (iv) a MIS to improve the management&#13;
capacity in the states; (v) institutional strengthening, particularly planning, budgeting and&#13;
administration to boost performance. (b) Advisory Committee: The Advisory Committee (composed&#13;
of the SSA and its line departments, NAFIN, SHCP, and other stakeholders) wil assist the PCU in&#13;
facilitating and ensuring effective execution of the project. Its functions include: (i) approval of the&#13;
annual investment plans and budgets; (ii) monitoring of project implementation; (iii) adjudication of&#13;
agreements and legal covenants; (iv) unification of technical norms and implementation criteria among&#13;
executing agencies; and (v) provision of technical assistance to the PCU and the SPCUs. (c) SPCUs:&#13;
The SHAs, namely the State Health Directors (Jefes de Servicios Coordinados de Salud) have the&#13;
overall responsibility for project implementation. For coordination and oversight of the project, small&#13;
41 to be reviewed and updated during the second semester of 1995&#13;
42 Orgamgram and staff conposition in Annex 13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
SPCUs would be created in the project states (or continue operating in states the of First Basic Health&#13;
Care project). These SPCUs would function within the SHAs and would be responsible for: (i)&#13;
coordination and supervision of the implementation of all project components; (ii) monitor project&#13;
implementation at the state and jurisdictional level; (iii) prepare periodic progress reports as requested&#13;
by the federal PCU. To strengthen the management and implementation capacity of the SPCUs, the&#13;
project would finance consultants or rely on existing staff trained under the First Basic Health Care&#13;
project, in areas such as planning, supervision, administration, financing and procurement. All states&#13;
participating in the institutional development and decentralization component (Component I1) would&#13;
have a Decentralization Support Unit (DSU), consisting of two consultants and support staff to assist&#13;
state health directors in the execution of the component.&#13;
2.71  The loan would finance office equipment, supplies, technical assistance and training of PCU&#13;
and DSU staff. During appraisal, agreement was reached on the TOR for the federal Advisory&#13;
Committee. As a conditon of loan effectiveness, the federal PCU, and Adisory Committee will&#13;
have been established with staffing level and composition satisfactory to the Bank and SPCUs would&#13;
have been established with tenms of reference, and staff composition satisfactory to the Bank in at&#13;
least five of the eleven project states (pam. 3.2(c)).&#13;
2.72  The implementation responsibilities of the SHAs for the Basic Fealth Care component&#13;
(Component I) would include to: (a) assist the health jurisdictions in the design of subprojects to be&#13;
financed through the annual investment plan, and in the execution of the respective subproject; (b)&#13;
evaluate past and authorize new subprojects; (c) submit, in coordination with the PCU, the annual&#13;
investment plans (POAs) to the central SSA; and (d) participate in the annual negotiations of state and&#13;
municipal contributions for the project.&#13;
2.73 The SSA, in particular the Undersecretariat for Planning, the PCU and external consultants&#13;
would be in charge of implementing component II (Institutional Development and Decentralization)&#13;
and of Component m (Modernization and Restructuring of the SSA). The General Directorate of&#13;
Evaluation and the General Directorate of Economic Studies of the SSA would have the overall&#13;
responsibility for Component II and for project monitoring and evaluation. Specifically, they would&#13;
review the decentralization process, including targets for the transfer of functions and responsibilities.&#13;
Jointly with the PCU, they would present to the Bank the project implementation status during the&#13;
annual implementation reviews.&#13;
2.74 Subproject Preparation and Pipeline: The project features a new preparation pipeline and&#13;
budget flow mechanism, which allows for targeting the poorest jurisdictions within selected states. ¶Ib&#13;
become fully operational, it requires the annual preparation of subproject proposals by the health&#13;
jurisdictions. Strict criteria for selecting investment areas and for evaluating expeditiously proposals&#13;
will be applied (Annex 7). Such criteria will also introduce incentives to increase efficiency and&#13;
quality, by directly linking resource availability to performance. The annual evaluation of subprojects&#13;
will be based on a combination of process and outcome indicators, including epideirdological impact,&#13;
budget and program execution, which measure changes in health status, financial performance, and&#13;
quality improvements. The Operational Manual will descnbe the specific procedures for subproject&#13;
preparation and pipeline, such as: (a) how to select target jurisdictions; (b) how to manage project&#13;
funds; and (c) how to monitor and supervise project implementation. Project operation includes also&#13;
control mechanisms, such as physical inventory surveys before receipt of new equipment and annual&#13;
audits by external auditors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
2.75  The Operational Manual will outline preparation of subproject proposals by health jurisdictions&#13;
(Annex 9). Proposals must include information on the selection of target areas, appraisal of projects,&#13;
timetable for implementation, flow of funds, financing (community, state and federal), operation and&#13;
maintenance. Specifically, such proposals would include: (a) an overview of the state's demographic&#13;
and epidemiological profiles; (b) general objectives of the subproject; (c) proposed health interventions&#13;
that will be used to achieve the stated objectives; (d) identification of the project location, including&#13;
justification of the priority area; (e) current resources available in the state and the priority jurisdiction,&#13;
including physical, institutional and financial resources; (f) identification of the executing unit within&#13;
the state; (g) estimated benefits, in termns of health impact for the population; (h) estimated costs,&#13;
including the incremental recurrent costs; and (i) mechanisms to ensure commitment and ownership.&#13;
By delegating responsibility for design and implementation to jurisdictions and municipalities, the&#13;
proposed project encourages community participation, in planning, budgeting and execution of&#13;
subprojects. But this requires the transfer of authority and responsibility for subproject selection,&#13;
execution, financial management and operation and maintenance from the states to health jurisdictions&#13;
and further to participating municipalities.&#13;
1. PROJECT SUPERVISION AND REPORTING&#13;
2.76 Annual Progress and Investment Plan Review. The annual review to be prepared by the&#13;
PCU by September each year would focus on overall project implementation, including training,&#13;
technical assistance, health services delivery, disbursement and procurement issues. The review&#13;
would: (a) analyze the previous year's project performance based on an activi.y report and recurrent&#13;
budget allocation; (b) analyze the proposed subsequent year's investment plan and budget, including&#13;
plans for maintenance, human resources and training, staffing and contracts, institutional development,&#13;
MIS, civil works and environmental impact analyses; (c) analyze annual research plans and proposed&#13;
pilot projects, including a review of the TORs of studies and projects, submitted for Bank approval&#13;
and (d) analyze indicators and evaluation reports presented by the SSA.&#13;
2.77 Mid Term Review: In September 1998 a midterm review would assess project impact and&#13;
performance with regard to project development and performance objectives. The review would also&#13;
assess project results in extending services in the target area, its organization, coordination, quality,&#13;
effectiveness, and efficiency. It would review the scope of the decentralization process and the degree&#13;
of institutional development and advances made in the organizational modernization of the SSA. The&#13;
SSA would coordinate with participating institutions to analyze and present indicators and evaluation&#13;
reports for the performance of each component. The PCU would be responsible for hiring consultants&#13;
and preparing their TORs; (which would be submitted to the Bank for comments), for coordinating the&#13;
mid term review, and for incorporating the findings and recommendations into a final report. At&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached that the SSA would conduct jointly with the Bank annual&#13;
reviews by September each year, and a mid-term review by September 1998 (pam. 3.1(i)).&#13;
2.78 Project Monitoring: Health projects often suffer from the lack of clear progress and/or&#13;
outcome indicators. This is a particular problem where data collection is poor or non-existent. Also,&#13;
concrete indicators are often unavailable and the calculation of economic returns is unreliable. This is&#13;
currently the case for most project jurisdictions. Baseline indicators are unavailable or flawed due to&#13;
underreporting; the latter causing indicators to deteriorate once the reporting system starts to improve.&#13;
A baseline survey is currently underway in the entire project area. Process, implementation, impact&#13;
and policy indicators have been defined for this project and will be monitored thrmughout&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
implementation. Indicators will also be used to monitor the quality of services and user satisfaction in&#13;
the target jurisdictions. Besides being a powerful tool for project management in the participating&#13;
states, indicators will lay the groundwork for subsequent subproject preparation (Annex 10). In&#13;
addition, the results of the Second National Health Survey43 have become available for the target&#13;
states. The SSA will ensure: (a) the validity of a baseline survey to be carried out during project&#13;
preparation simultaneously with the diagnostic survey of infrastructure in the participating health&#13;
jurisdictions; (b) the inclusion of this baseline indicators and expected process and final indicators in all&#13;
subproject proposals for Component I and their evaluation during the subproject approval process; (c)&#13;
reviews of project impact in the participating states as reflected in standard epidemiological&#13;
surveillance data and the review of policy indicators for Component II and m; and (d) the final impact&#13;
evaluation of the entire project prior to its completion. The SSA would present the obtained&#13;
information at the joint annual reviews and make it available for the implementation completion report.&#13;
J. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
2.79 Project Benefits: The proposed project is expected to engender improvements in the health&#13;
status of the uninsured population in eleven states through the implementation of a basic health care&#13;
package of cost effective interventions. By transferring more programming, managing and budget&#13;
responsibilities to all 32 states and 243 health jurisdictions, the project would promote improvements&#13;
in the efficiency and equity of resource allocation and increased quality of service delivery. The main&#13;
benefits of the project would include: (a) the strengthening of the delivery of PHC, reducing the&#13;
prevalence of infectious diseases and reducing maternal mortality for a population of about 15.5&#13;
million people; (b) the institutional strengthening at the state and federal levels resulting from a&#13;
decentralization of functions and responsibilities and (c) the modemization of the SSA and&#13;
improvements in the efficiency and equity in the allocation and utilization of federal resources.&#13;
2.80 Although it is difficult to quantify the monetary and non-monetary benefits of the project, over&#13;
the medium- to long-term, the benefits can be grouped into:  (a) real per capita increases in&#13;
expenditures; (b) reductions in the burden of disease; (c) efficiency and equity gains in the allocation&#13;
o resources by modernizing the SSA, resulting in a reduction of administrative costs; and (d) greater&#13;
resource mobilization through increased revenues from user fees and state govemments and the&#13;
implementation of alternative models of resource mobilization.&#13;
2.81  In the project area, per capita expenditures for health were estimated at US$44 in 1993. It is&#13;
also estimated that the proposed project would increase annual health expenditures by 15 percent, or to&#13;
approximately US$52 annually. Over the short-term, these additional resources would reverse the&#13;
decline in per capita spending, experienced between 1986 and 1993, and provide the target health&#13;
jurisdictions with additional resources to ensure adequate delivery of basic health care services.&#13;
Reorienting spending toward the most cost-effective interventions would reduce the long-term costs by&#13;
ensuring the delivery of preventive care which decreases medium-to long-tenn costs by reducing&#13;
morbidity and mortality.&#13;
2.82  The project would support institutional strengthening in states and jurisdictions and decentnlize&#13;
decision-making to improve resource allocation. Savings would also be achieved by redistributing&#13;
fedexal health msources among the states. The third component of the project aims to modernize the&#13;
organizational and operational structure of the SSA, thereby freeing-up resources that can be invested&#13;
43 Fncuesta Nacional de Sald (ENSA I), SSA 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
in the direct provision of health services. It is estimated that a target reduction of 2 percent of current&#13;
administative spending would produce US$20.0 million in annual savings. These potential savings&#13;
could finance the 15 percent annual increase in spending necessary to sustain the project and free-up&#13;
additional resources to extend the basic package to the entire Mexican population.&#13;
2.83  Given the constraints on public spending, the Govemment is aware of the need to mobilize&#13;
additional resources to finance the health sector. Under the proposed project, this goal would be&#13;
achieved by improving efficiency and autonomy in the collection of user fees. State contributions to&#13;
the project are subject to annual negotiations with the Sate Govemors but would be fixed at least at 10&#13;
percent of total project costs. In terns of monetary benefits denived from these two mechanisms, it is&#13;
estimated that a 10 percent increase in user fee revenues would produce an additional US$2.4 million&#13;
in average annual revenues for the project, while increases in state contributions would add an&#13;
additional US$4.3 million, assuming only 50 percent compliance. These estimates are based on a&#13;
range of conservative assumptions (Annex 3). While many of the benefits may not fully materialim&#13;
during the life of the project, over the medium-term, expected retums would account for&#13;
approximately US$20.6 million, just about the annual recurrent costs of the proposed project.&#13;
Cost-Benefit Analysis&#13;
2.84 The proposed project is expected to engender significant improvements in the health status of&#13;
about 15.5 million uninsured people in eleven states through the implementation of a cost-effective&#13;
basic health care package.   By transferring more programming, managing and budgeting&#13;
responsibilities to states and jurisdictions, the project would promote improvements in the efficiency&#13;
and equity of resource allocation, quality of service delivery and institutional capacity of states and&#13;
jurisdictions. The project would also modemize and restructure the SSA so that it may resume its&#13;
leadership function in the sector. These components would impact the financial equilibrium of the&#13;
health sector by reducing admiistrative expenditures of the SSA and improving the health of the&#13;
uninsured population. Although many of the benefits of the project are not amenable to quantitative&#13;
estimates, a cost-benefit analysis of the Basic Health Care component, improved pharmaceuticals&#13;
management and reduced admstrative expenditures of the SSA, reveals that the project would pay&#13;
back the investment over the five year period of the loan. The following table displays the summary&#13;
msults of the quantitative retums of these aspects of the project.&#13;

The estimates for DALYs are based on the number of DALYs saved by the year 2000, while the other project interventions are&#13;
based on the expected monetary retWns in US$ millions.&#13;
2.85   Taking a conservative estimate of a 50 percent implementation success rate, the selected project&#13;
components would produce estimated cumulative savings of US$1,074 million by the year 2000.&#13;
Discounting the economic costs and benefits to reflect inflation and uncertainty, the net present value&#13;
(NPV) of these benefits would amount to over US$414 million by the year 2000. Based on estimated&#13;
expenditures of US$358 million in the above mentioned areas, the NPV of the benefits and costs&#13;
indicates a high rate of return, as the project would potentially pay back the investment within five&#13;
years. Furthermore, these investments would continue to produce significant gains, both quantitatively&#13;
and qualitatively, well into the next century.&#13;
2.86 Project Risks: Because the proposed project builds on the experience of the First Basic Health&#13;
Care project, many potential risks can be mitigated. However, risks remain in the following areas:&#13;
(a) institutional weaknesses of health sector agencies at the federal, state and jurisdictional levels, and&#13;
poor coordination between them; (b) resistance to change from strong interest groups, frequent&#13;
administrative changes and high staff turnover, affecting efficiency of project implementation; (c)&#13;
uncertain budgetary situation due to the recent currency devaluation. These risks will be minimized&#13;
by: (a) experience acquired in the first project and cross-feriXlization of lessons learned between&#13;
experienced and new project states; (b) the Government's commitment to the health sector&#13;
decentralization and reform in the near future; (c) preparation of annual implementation plans by the&#13;
state and federal agencies and annual and midterm reviews by the Bank.&#13;
K. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
2.87   The proposed project carries no environmental risk and is rated category "C". Standard safety&#13;
and environmental procedures already approved by the Bank for the ongoing project will be used for&#13;
civil works rehabilitation, installation and operation of medical equipment and handling of medical&#13;
waste. But a favorable environmental impact will be generated through: (a) improved training of&#13;
health workers in handling of medical waste; (b) the replacement and appropriate disposal of outdated&#13;
equipment and vehicles; and (c) the emergency rehabilitation of first level service facilities by&#13;
repairng inoperative or malfunctioning basic systems for water, sanitation and electricity.&#13;
L. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES&#13;
2.88   The project, especially the basic health care component, is in the poverty reduction category&#13;
and is a program of targeted interventions. It benefits the vulnerable poor and indigenous population,&#13;
which caffy a disproportionate burden of disease in the project areas. By supporting the SSA's health&#13;

network in the eleven least developed states it is geared to the uninsured and underserved. It invests in&#13;
basic health interventions as detenrined by the national poverty index developed by CONAPO.&#13;
Specific risk areas within these states are selected according to local epidemiological and socio-&#13;
economic conditions. These conditions were identified through health and nutrition surveys and&#13;
epidemiological studies carried out during 1993 and 1994.&#13;

BASIC HEALTH I&#13;
THE FIRST BASIC HEALTH CARE PROJECT&#13;
The ongoing Bank-financed $250 million "First Basic Health Care Project" becme effective in&#13;
1991. The project objectives are to: (a) strengthen and target basic health care services to about 13 million&#13;
|mnured poor in 47 health jurisdictions in Oaxaca, Chiapas, Hidalgo, Guerro and marginal zones in the&#13;
Federal District; (b) support institutional improvements to strengthen management capability to enhance&#13;
the eficiency and effectiveness of the health care system-; and (e) strengthen the implementation of sectoral&#13;
reforms to decentralize budgetary, management and operational responsibilities from the federal to the state&#13;
level. The project consists of two major components:&#13;
(a) Health Services Comnonent: (89 percent of total project costs).&#13;
This component focuses on improving and extending delivery of basic heath care to 13 million&#13;
uninsured people in the project states. Specific subcomponents are: 0) rehabilitating, upgrading and&#13;
expanding the health network and developing a maintenance progtam  for facilities and biomedical&#13;
equipment; (ii) providing equipment, furniture, vehicles and basic medical supplies; (iii) hiring,&#13;
teassigning, and regarding personnel to fit the BASIC HEALTH CARE program (iv) improving the&#13;
supervision system and technical training for professional and auxiliary health staff; and (v) producing and&#13;
distributing operational manuals and materials.&#13;
l b)J mtialoW Development Component (11 percent of toal project costs).&#13;
At the federal level, the project: () provides assistance to facilitate the decentralization process&#13;
and conducts operational research to promote services delivery and set policies and priorities; (ii) mobilizes&#13;
additional resources fot basic health care and carries out operationa  searh ad impact evaluation; and&#13;
(iii) stegthens management information systems to improve plannig, analysis and mnnagement&#13;
capacities.l&#13;
At the  stat lovel, this component assists in improving: (i) managoment, administation, and&#13;
planning capacities of state health authorities; (H) personnel policies and management; and (ii) training&#13;
opportaities inmanagement and administration for managers and adrinistrative staff. The project&#13;
benefits 13 million uninsured people in the prject states by reducing the prevalence of infectious diseases,&#13;
in pariclar assisting more than 3 million women of ehildboeaing age (1545 yea) and 1.7 million infants&#13;
and children under age five. In addition, the project contributes to improvements in the management,&#13;
administration, client rtsponsiveness aad overall efficiency of public health servloes in the proje  states,&#13;
partly as a result of system decentralization. The project increases the proportion of overall public health&#13;
resourcesgoing to preventive health care for vulnerable gtoups in the poorest stawte of Mexico.&#13;
Appraisal of the First Basic Health Care Project Implementation Status&#13;
Project Overview&#13;
The Bank is financing a five-year health project in Mexico with a loan of US$180 million, (First&#13;
Basic Health Care Project - Loan 3272-ME) that began implementation in 1991 and is expected to close in&#13;
1996. The project objectives are to: (a) strengthen and extend basic health care services and targeted&#13;
nutrition assistance to about 13 million uninsured poor in selected health jurisdictions of four states -&#13;
Oaxaca, Chiapas, Hidalgo, and Guerrero and the Federal District; (b) support institutional improvements&#13;
and strengthen management to enhance health care efficiency and effectiveness; and (c) support sector&#13;
reforms to decentralize budget, management and operations to the states. This is being accomplished&#13;
through two components: (a) Health Services, focused on improving and extending delivery of basic&#13;
health care and nutrition to target areas, through improving and expanding health facilities,  and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                     ANNEX 1&#13;
BASIC HEALTH I&#13;
reorganizing and training staff to meet program requirements; and (b) Institutional Development at&#13;
Federal and state levels, to accomplish the stated objectives of decentralization and increased services&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
Implementation is proceeding reasonably well after initial delays in project execution mainly&#13;
resulting from an inefficient system for transferring funds from the central SSA to the states and for&#13;
preparing the budget (see Annex 3, Section IV) and also as a consequence of frequent changes in the state&#13;
governments of the four project states and unfamiliarity with the Bank procurement process. The pace of&#13;
project implementation experienced a steady improvement since 1991. Beginning in the second year,&#13;
utilization of the total resources (i.e., Government funds and Loan financing) available annually for the&#13;
project improved from a low rate of 49 percent in 1991, to 84 percent in 1992 and 88 percent in 1993.&#13;
Another indication of improvement in the pace of implementation is given by stepped up disbursements,&#13;
which as of December, 1994 reached $113.2 million or 87 percent of original SAR estimates, compared&#13;
to a low 23 percent in October, 1992.&#13;
These significant improvements in project implementation are due in large part to substantial&#13;
efforts and time invested by the state health authorities and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) at SSA to&#13;
overcome an inefficient system. Nevertheless, difficulties with the release of funds to the states continued&#13;
to afflict the project until last year. For the execution of the remainder of the First Basic Health Care&#13;
Project, and starting in 1995, project managers will use new mechanisms for budget preparation and flow&#13;
of funds to the states agreed for the second Basic Health Care Project. These new procedures are intended&#13;
to increase flexibility, decentralize planning and execution, and increase budgetary transparency at federal&#13;
and state levels. The new system also introduces competition into the budget process and incentives to&#13;
execute the budget efficiently by making the health districts compete annually for a fixed pool of&#13;
resources.  Future allocations of budget resources to districts will take into account past annual&#13;
performance based on specific indicators which would measure the success of the respective districts in&#13;
using funds in effective health interventions (e.g., appropriate allocations for preventive programs,&#13;
selection of basic packages of health interventions most relevant to health conditions in each area, use of&#13;
private sector contractors when more suitable and less costly for certain types of services).&#13;
In October 1993, a mid-term review of this project was conducted jointly by the Bank and the&#13;
Federal Government. The conclusions and recommendations of that review provided a good basis for: (a)&#13;
emphasizing unimplemented features of the project; (b) reorienting efforts to reach project objectives&#13;
including introduction of the already mentioned new mechanisms for transfer of fund to the states; and (c)&#13;
recommendations on staffing and training. The mid-term review also identified the sluggish performance&#13;
of the Institutional Development Component, the need to streamline the project evaluation process, and&#13;
the desirability of much more emphasis on improving the quality and effectiveness of the SSA health&#13;
services.&#13;
Under the First Basic Health Care Project, the program for construction and rehabilitation of&#13;
health facilities including centers, hospitals, warehouses and laboratories, as well as purchase of new&#13;
equipment and hiring and training of new staff made reasonable progress. However, there were several&#13;
implementation problems that led to reassessment and adaptation of the original plans. Agreement was&#13;
reached on contracting technical assistance for supervision of construction and improvements in building&#13;
design, studies on service utilization and effectiveness, and on institutional development. Findings will&#13;
have wide application in the next project.&#13;
Regarding institutional development, there has been no progress in legal decentralization of&#13;
SSA's health service functions to the states, nor in institutional revisions or management strengthening.&#13;
These are areas of emphasis in the new project in which new strategies and programs will be adopted to&#13;
achieve results. Regarding monitoring and evaluation, the first round of data collection for the baseline&#13;
&#13;

BASIC HEALTH I&#13;
study to assess project progress and community impact took place beginning in 1993; first results and&#13;
analyses were presented at a seminar conducted in July 1994. Consequently, no measurement of project&#13;
impact on the health situation of communities is yet possible.  Nevertheless, the establishment of&#13;
benchmarks for the project states is an important accomplishment that will enable evaluation in years to&#13;
come, as comparative surveys are conducted in the same states. There are, however, process indicators&#13;
concerning building and remodeling of facilities and information on staff recruitment and training, as well&#13;
as information on actions related to improvement of administrative processes, contained in several&#13;
volumes prepared by the PCU, and presented below.&#13;
Civil Works Program&#13;
The program of construction and rehabilitation of health facilities had a slow beginning. In 1992&#13;
and 1993, there were difficulties due to lack of familiarity in the states with Bank's procurement&#13;
procedures, unavailability of funds in the first few months of each of those years due to the complicated&#13;
budget process and problems with its execution, as well as a low institutional capacity. However, since&#13;
late 1993 (after the mid-term review), the programn experienced good progress, with the PCU at the&#13;
central level offering technical assistance through its own staff and by hiring private sector consultants.&#13;
Quality of construction remodeling and new buildings, as well as relevance of the civil works programs to&#13;
health service needs also improved through careful definition of priorities according to demand for&#13;
services, preparation of inventories of existing facilities with specification of condition, use of private&#13;
sector consultants for supervision, and employment of private consultants for redesign of building&#13;
prototypes. Regarding the latter, the PCU hired consultants who prepared designs and working drawings&#13;
for the 1994-95 civil works program, based on standard plans but with improved technical specifications&#13;
and designs, and clearer descriptions of specifications for contractors.&#13;
In 1990 there were 1,352 SSA primary care units in the project areas, of which 1,141 needed&#13;
rehabilitation; it was also appraised that 25 hospitals would be rehabilitated, although this program was&#13;
later reduced to 17 hospitals. During 1991-94, 787 primary level units were rehabilitated (or 69 percent&#13;
of the proposed work). Contracts were signed to remodel 14 hospitals (82 percent of target); work in two&#13;
hospitals has already been completed and in other 10 remodeling work is underway. Regarding new&#13;
buildings, the original appraisal plan was to build 267 new health centers, 3 state warehouses, 2 anti-&#13;
rabies centers and one centro de salud mixto; this plan was later revised decreasing the number of new&#13;
units and adding to the construction program 3 state laboratories and 5 warehouses. By October, 1994,&#13;
91 (or 34 percent) centers as well as 3 state warehouses, had been built. Although the pace of the civil&#13;
works was slower than programmed at appraisal, and there were changes regarding numbers and types of&#13;
facilities built, these adaptations resulted in more relevant and effective improvements in the network of&#13;
health physical facilities in the project states. Moreover, the strategy adopted of giving priority in the&#13;
first three years to rehabilitation works over new construction and of establishing priorities in the&#13;
program for new buildings on the basis of staff availability and overall impact on operational efficiency&#13;
allowed for the optimal use of resources. For example, the new warehouses in Chiapas, Oaxaca and&#13;
Hidalgo have improved significantly the control and distribution of materials and equipment in those&#13;
states, while postponing new construction of health facilities allowed the PCU to reassess needs and&#13;
prepare more functional designs for buildings.&#13;
Maintenance of Health Centers and Hospitals&#13;
The project provides financing of a permanent corrective and preventive maintenance program,&#13;
construction of workshops, and use of private contractors for specialized maintenance. Progress in&#13;
carrying out a significant maintenance program  has been slow  in all project states.  Obstacles to&#13;
implementation are a lack of conviction on the part of managers that maintenance is important and that a&#13;
specific budget should be allocated annually for that purpose. Although a manual of maintenance and&#13;
conservation of health centers was prepared and distributed to the states, its use has been limited. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44                                      ANNEX 1&#13;
BASIC HEALTH I&#13;
mid-term review recommended that each state should develop appropriate pilot maintenance plans, test the&#13;
application of the IMSS maintenance program to SSA's state systems, and design a training program for&#13;
managers and staff to develop the right attitudes and skills for maintenance. Training of staff and testing&#13;
of innovative and effective systems of maintenance of health facilities, vehicles and equipment, including&#13;
alternatives to state-run maintenance programs involving use of private contractors, will continue to be a&#13;
priority in Bank supervision for the remainder of the project period. The goal at project completion is for&#13;
the state authorities to have assessed results of the trials for maintenance systems and to assume&#13;
responsibility for appropriate state-wide maintenance plans.&#13;
Health Network Operation and Management&#13;
The original project plans provided funds for hiring approximately 6,800 staff to fill vacant&#13;
positions in underserved areas of the project states, during the 5-year project period. In 1991-92, 4,838&#13;
new positions were authorized (71 percent of target). Of these, 65 percent were assigned to improvement&#13;
of health service delivery and 35 percent to support institutional development at central, state and district&#13;
levels. In 1993, 715 new positions were requested but they were not authorized by the Secretariat of&#13;
Finance because of budget constraints; the same situation prevailed in 1994.  The Bank and the&#13;
Government agree that the original estimate of 6,800 new staff requirements was too high and that&#13;
improvements in health service coverage and in service quality could be achieved more cost-effectively&#13;
through a reassessment of existing staff categories and functions, staff training and suitable incentives. In&#13;
1993, there was a study in the Federal District to match and adjust staff requirements to functions. With&#13;
reclassification of over 900 positions, requirements for new positions would decrease from 280 at&#13;
appraisal, to just 86. However, in order to make these adjustments in personnel, which would result in&#13;
future budgetary savings, the Federal District would have needed $960,000 for paying for redundancies,&#13;
retirement benefits and relocation expenses, that were unavailable in the annual budget. Similar staff&#13;
reclassification studies are being conducted in the other project states and the PCU will continue its&#13;
dialogue with the Public Service Commission on the subject of health staff rationalization. The goal at&#13;
project completion is the implementation of staff rationalization within the health services of the project&#13;
states in response to new, more effective service designs, and increasing pressures to streamline budgets.&#13;
The project is successfully supporting the training and hiring of a newly created category of health&#13;
worker, the rural health technician (TAPS) to promote primary health care and preventive measures,&#13;
particularly in remote rural areas where it has been difficult to retain services of doctors and nurses.&#13;
TAPS are selected from the respective communities. Training began in July 1991 and until the end of&#13;
1993, 844 TAPS had been trained and in position in the four states. In January 1993 two states -&#13;
Guerrero and Hidalgo - began training a second batch (135 and 35 respectively), and Oaxaca requested&#13;
funding for training 61 TAPS. The central SSA has not authorized the new positions of the second batch,&#13;
because of budgetary restrictions. The PCU is pursuing this matter with SSA so that this program can be&#13;
fully implemented, to the benefit of the underserved population. Approval of these new positions would&#13;
be facilitated if savings could be made in other areas of the health services, particularly in urban areas&#13;
where overlapping services are known to exist. Such changes would address the current deficit of&#13;
primary level health care services and preventive programs in rural communities.&#13;
Training&#13;
Between 1991 and 1993 (at the time of the mid-term review), a total of 63,079 service staff and&#13;
4,077 management level staff had received some type of training well above project plans. The project&#13;
helped complement the regular training in the states by placing 28 training coordinators at jurisdictional&#13;
level and provided materials and equipment. While training emphasis in the first three years of the project&#13;
was on service staff, management training will be the major thrust during the last two years of the project.&#13;
There are plans to contract management training to universities, and to technological and public&#13;
administration institutes. Identification of training needs has improved considerably, with the training of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

BASIC HEALTH I&#13;
coordinators in appropriate methodologies. Also, SSA organized a training and evaluation committee to&#13;
oversee the quality and impact of training, in addition to keeping up with the quantitative targets.&#13;
Institutional Development&#13;
The legal decentralization of health services to the states has not taken place as originally planned,&#13;
with the exception of Guerrero. However, several processes have been de facto decentralized in the other&#13;
project states A major step in this direction has been the decentralization of the planning and budgeting&#13;
process. The health jurisdictions, under the guidance of the state health offices, are currently preparing&#13;
their own annual plans (including training plans responsive to their particular needs), which are&#13;
subsequently reviewed by the PCU and presented to the Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL)&#13;
without prior approval by the central SSA. For program execution, budgeted funds are transferred&#13;
directly from the Secretariat of Finance to the states. Another processing improvement introduced by this&#13;
project is in the procurement of civil works, good and supplies. The states prepare their respective&#13;
procurement plans, and bidding documents, evaluate bids, award contracts and authorize payments. These&#13;
innovative changes in the project states have been difficult, because of the long tradition of rigid&#13;
procedures applied by the central SSA. However, these efforts have been rewarded with increased&#13;
efficiency and expediency and they have been well received by the state health authorities, which&#13;
increasingly demand greater autonomy in managing the health services. It is up to the new Mexican&#13;
Administration to move further ahead with the health services decentralization process.&#13;
First steps to address institutional weaknesses have taken place in individual states. For instance,&#13;
Chiapas conducted a state-wide survey of health infrastructure in 1992-93 that led to an accurate count of&#13;
facilities by type. The survey also showed that both SSA and IMSS Solidarity tended to concentrate their&#13;
facilities in urban or more developed rural areas, leaving remote, poor rural areas with no access to&#13;
services. This led to a revision of the civil works program to make it more responsive to outstanding&#13;
needs in underserved areas throughout the state. By the time of the mid-term review, Hidalgo and Oaxaca&#13;
states had began similar surveys and reviews. However, the problem of overlapping services by both&#13;
organizations still persists, because its solution implies closing facilities and reducing personnel. As&#13;
budgetary and service responsibilities are transferred to the state governments in the future, and&#13;
institutional development is tackled in earnest, this issue will become more prominent, since its settlement&#13;
could represent significant savings and efficiency gains.&#13;
This first health project included financing of operational research and studies aimed at studying&#13;
specific issues hampering institutional development, management and delivery of health services, as well&#13;
as monitoring and evaluation. During the first two years of the project, there were no funds in the budget&#13;
to carry out any studies. At the mid-term review in October, 1993, this problem was identified and&#13;
resources were allocated in 1994 to contract consultants to undertake priority studies. At a July, 1994&#13;
meeting to review the entire research program for this project, fourteen studies were presented and their&#13;
scope and design were assessed by the PCU and the Bank; these studies are now at various stages of&#13;
development. Noteworthy are the studies for evaluation of the First Basic Health Care Project, being&#13;
conducted in three phases: (1) operations; (ii) health and nutrition profiles for indigenous groups; and (iii)&#13;
evaluation of the health impact. Data for the evaluation of the project operations by states were compiled&#13;
for the project's three years and analyzed and presented to the 1994 annual review meeting; data for the&#13;
second phase on health and nutrition conditions of indigenous populations were compiled and a&#13;
preliminary analysis completed. The third phase, on health impact, will not be possible to complete until&#13;
another round of surveys is conducted in subsequent years and compared with the 1994 baseline data.&#13;
The project is also financing analyses of the National Health Survey II: data for the project states; this is a&#13;
representative sample at state level. Other studies include one on cervico-uterine cancer and another on&#13;
diarrhea.&#13;

HEALTH COVERAGE&#13;
AND POPULATION&#13;
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS&#13;
The public sector: The public sector consists of those institutions which provide medical&#13;
services to the uninsured (34 percent of the population) and implement public health programs (SSA,&#13;
the state health authorities and IMSS-Solidaridad). The SSA and the state health agencies have a&#13;
network of 13,339 first level health posts, 676 second level district hospitals and 157 third level&#13;
hospitals in all states; SSA also maintains ten national centers (Institutos Nacionales de Salud) for&#13;
research and teaching purposes in Mexico City. In addition, the SSA is responsible for setting national&#13;
policies and norms for the health sector. The entire health sector has 426,924 staff, (the SSA accounts&#13;
for 121,0681) of which 30 percent are allocated in the Federal District, 37 percent in the 14&#13;
decentralized states and 33 percent in 17 states that have not yet been decentralized.  A total of&#13;
103,354 or 24 percent of the staff from the above mentioned agencies are medical doctors, 177,334 or&#13;
42 percent are paramedical and nursing staff and the remainder (34 percent) are administrative and&#13;
service personnel. They spend US$50 per user, 11 percent of which is dedicated to public health&#13;
purposes.&#13;
In addition to the SSA, IMSS-Solidaridad also provides basic health services to the marginal,&#13;
often indigenous areas in 16 states. This program is financed through federal funds and managed by&#13;
IMSS. The coverage of IMSS-Solidaridad varies by state, but amounts to 13 percent on a national&#13;
average (or about 11 million persons). Between 1988 and 1992, the infrastructure available increased&#13;
by 40 percent. It currently operates a network of 3,323 rural medical units and 57 rural hospitals, with&#13;
radio communication and staff available 24 hours a day. Estimates show that in 1993 the above&#13;
mentioned coverage amounted to an annual cost of US$30 per individual entitled to the service under&#13;
the Solidarity Program. The provision of services emphasizes preventative public health interventions,&#13;
with over 20 percent of the budget allotted to this purpose.?&#13;
The social security sector:3  The IMSS covers employees of the private sector and their&#13;
families. The IMSS has a three level care network with 1,476 family medicine units (first level care),&#13;
209 district hospitals with specialized departments (second level care) and 10 National Medical&#13;
Centers, as well as three highly specialized third level care institutes. Nationwide, the IMSS employs&#13;
a total staff of 328,470, which amounts to more than 11 insured persons per staff. A total of 37.5&#13;
million Mexicans are insured by IMSS. The insured receive additional fringe benefits, such as daycare&#13;
centers, vacation facilities and cultural institutions.  The IMSS spends about US$150 per insured&#13;
person per year, of which only 3 percent is devoted to disease prevention. The ISSSTE insures&#13;
Federal employees and their families. Its has 1085 first level care facilities, 165 second level district&#13;
hospitals and 11 third level National Medical Centers. ISSSTE employs 52,653 staff which provide&#13;
services to 8.5 million insured. Insured members of ISSSTE also receive fringe benefits. It spends&#13;
US$107 per insured person. There are also state level ISSSTE agencies that provide insurance to state&#13;
government employees. The smaller social security institutions such as the agency of the Mexican&#13;
Petroleum Company (Petroleos Mexicanos - PEMEX), and the armed services (Secretarta de la&#13;
Defensa Nacional, Secretar(a de la Marina - SEDENA, MARINA) cover the petroleum industry, the&#13;
armed forces and the navy, respectively and offer first, second and third level care to their insured&#13;
population. Various other institutions, such as the Instituto para el Desarrollo Integral de la Familia&#13;
(DIF) and the Instituto Nacional Indigenista (INI), provide social services to specific groups (families&#13;

percent of the total population, but account for 81 percent of total health expenditures.&#13;
The private sector: The private sector is made up of a heterogeneous body of individuals and&#13;
corporations that provide traditional health care, alternative therapies and outpatient care, in clinics,&#13;
hospitals and through insurance companies. According to the 1987 Health Survey, this sector covers&#13;
37 percent of the effective demand for services in the country. In urban areas it consists mainly of fee-&#13;
for-service practices and a rapidly emerging market of unregulated private health insurance and Health&#13;
Maintenance Organizations (HMO), while in rural areas private practitioners are mainly traditional&#13;
healers, widely used by the rural people. There are about 2,000 private hospital units in operation.&#13;
Most of them (81 percent) have fewer than 14 beds and half of those have fewer than 5 beds. The&#13;
Government only recently passed laws to regulate the private sector including the accreditation of&#13;
hospitals. A demand survey, carried out in five of the First Basic Health Care Project states showed&#13;
that at least 50 percent of physicians working in first level health care centers act also as private&#13;
providers.&#13;

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TRANSITION&#13;
Mexico is subject to an epidemiological transition under a dilated-polarized model, which is&#13;
characterized by a heterogeneity of disease patterns, all present at the same time. Infectious diseases&#13;
and malnutrition coexist with non-communicable, chronic diseases and injuries. Despite significant&#13;
reductions in mortality by infectious diseases, these conditions have not been brought fully under&#13;
control. While total fertility (TFR) will continue to decline, the total number of births will not decrease&#13;
in the short run (currently 2.5 million per year and 400,000 more than in 1988) and annual absolute&#13;
additions of population will increase. The demands of an aging population with an ever higher&#13;
prevalence of non-communicable diseases, which require more costly and complicated treatment, will&#13;
compete for resources. At the same time, the health system needs to allocate resources for prevention&#13;
and treatment of infectious diseases and reproductive problems related to the increase in births. Under&#13;
these circumstances, the specific health needs of the population may grow faster than the ability of the&#13;
health system to respond to these new conditions.&#13;

HEALTH CARE FINANCING IN MEXICO&#13;
I. Introduction. In 1988, the government of President Salinas made health care a priority in&#13;
the new government's political agenda. As a result, total federal health spending has been increasing&#13;
at nearly 15 percent per year in real terms and has now reached an estimated 2.8 percent of GDP.&#13;
Private sector spending, which has increased in response to the decline in the quality of public services&#13;
and increases in income levels, has increased to 2 percent of GDP, or an estimated US$79 per capita.&#13;
Despite the increases in health care spending, Table 1 shows that the current levels of health care&#13;
spending in Mexico remain below the levels of other middle-income countries in Latin America.&#13;

The Mexican health sector has made important progress in the past 6 years in extending&#13;
coverage and improving the health status of the population. Since 1989, per capita health spending has&#13;
increased in real terms from US$89 per capita to US$185, reflecting the expansion of public health&#13;
services provided by the SSA and the increase in private sector spending. Through the increase in&#13;
expenditure and more comprehensive primary health care programs, the government has reduced many&#13;
of the structural problems which arose as a result of the economic crisis that embraced most of the&#13;
Latin American countries during the 1980s. And while the comparison in spending to other middle-&#13;
income countries would suggest that the Government of Mexico may be under-spending on health care,&#13;
the unfinished agenda in the sector is oriented toward improvements in the efficiency and equity in the&#13;
allocation of health spending and increasing the quality of service provision.&#13;
This annex will describe the basic elements of health financing, trends in health expenditures,&#13;
and the problems which limit efficiency, equity and quality of health sector spending. The annex is&#13;
divided into 6 sections. Section I provides an overview of health financing, followed by a description&#13;
of trends in health sector expenditures over the past several years and a description of current health&#13;
expenditures in the 11 project states in Section II. Section III reviews the existing recurrent costs in the&#13;
project states in comparison to the projected incremental recurrent costs of the Second Basic Health&#13;
Care Project. Section IV will describe the budget process and its problems and the problems with&#13;
efficiency and equity in the allocation of resources. Section V outlines the basic elements of the&#13;
financing mechanism that will be employed by the Second Basic Health Care Project to improve the&#13;
flow of resources and reduce many of the inefficiencies which limit the timeliness and effectiveness of&#13;
health sector investments. The last section outlines the predicted economic benefits of the project.&#13;

HEALTH CARE FINANCE&#13;
II. Overview of Health Care Financing.&#13;
Health care financing in Mexico follows the standard model of financing and provision in the&#13;
Latin American health sector. The social security system provides services to public (ISSSTE) and&#13;
private sector workers (IMSS) with tripartite financing from the employers, workers, and the&#13;
government, while the Secretariat of Health (SSA) provides services to the uninsured and the indigent&#13;
population with financing from the central government budget. In addition, the SSA and IMSS-&#13;
Solidaridad are responsible for providing the Mexican population with many pure public health&#13;
activities such as vaccinations and health education campaigns. Coordination between the various&#13;
institutions in the sector is low, resulting in a considerable overlap in the functions performed by each&#13;
respective institution.&#13;
Aside from the contributions from the central government budget and income from payroll&#13;
taxation, health sector revenues are generated through three additional sources: (i) state government&#13;
contributions; (ii) PRONASOL; and (iii) user fee revenues. During the 1980s, the share of revenues&#13;
from these three sources increased significantly in response to the declining resources of the federal&#13;
government. The state government contributions, which accounted for between 3 and 5 percent of&#13;
total health care spending, now account for between 5 and 15 percent of total spending at the state&#13;
4&#13;
level. The resources of PRONASOL, which account for just 2 percent of total SSA spending, finance&#13;
selected investment at the local level under the overarching objective of eliminating poverty and&#13;
improving the infrastructure of the public sector. The third component of health sector revenues, user&#13;
fee revenues, have increased from under 5 percent of the total SSA spending to just under 10 percent.&#13;
Despite the fact that approximately 75 percent of all user fee revenues remain at the state level, the&#13;
expenditure of these revenues is highly regulated by the central government, thereby reducing the&#13;
efficiency and efficacy of the expenditures.&#13;
Figure 1: Health Sector Spending, By Institution       Overall, Figure  1 shows that&#13;
IMSS and ISSSTE account for 75&#13;

expenditure, the SSA 21 percent,&#13;

The Mexican health sector is&#13;
strongly biased towards the least cost interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality. The allocation&#13;
of resources between programs of the SSA displayed in Figure 2 reflects the misallocation of&#13;
resources. The distribution of spending in the sector is highly skewed toward the delivery of less cost&#13;
effective interventions: of total SSA expenditures, under 10 percent of total spending is allocated to&#13;
preventive programs and public health outreach activities, while 65 percent is spent on curative care&#13;

increased from under US$100 per&#13;
year  to  over  US$185.    This&#13;
demonstrates that aside from the&#13;
population increase over the past&#13;
several years, health inflation has risen more rapidly than the price increases in the economy in&#13;
general. In the poorest states, however, the per capita spending has declined in real terms since 1989.&#13;
In the 4 project states included in the First Basic Health Care Project, per capita spending has declined&#13;
by 25 percent overall, demonstrating that although health care spending has increased overall, the&#13;
distribution of SSA spending remains inequitable.&#13;
Table 2 shows that the high cost of curative care and the higher quality of services in IMSS has&#13;
increased per capita spending to over US$140 per capita, or over twice the per capita spending of the&#13;
SSA.&#13;

IMSS-Solidaridad offers many of the primary health care services provided by the SSA, but at&#13;
half the cost. The relatively high spending levels per capita, despite the fact that nearly 12 million&#13;
uninsured are technically without coverage, points to the need to improve efficiency and equity in the&#13;
use of health sector resources.&#13;
Due to the constraints on public sector spending, federal spending, as a share of the total&#13;
spending of the SSA, has been declining over the past six years. In response to the decline in federal&#13;
funding, the SSA has increased revenues from user fees, investment from PRONASOL and Basic&#13;
Health Care I (3272-ME). Between 1987 and 1993, federal resources declined from over 90 percent of&#13;
the total resources of the SSA to 70 percent, while user fee revenues increased from just under I&#13;
percent to 6 percent of total revenues; at the state level, user fee revenues have increased to roughly 10&#13;
percent of total SSA revenues. In addition, contributions from the state governments have been&#13;
increasing at roughly 15 percent annually in real terms. These trends however, in light of the current&#13;
economic situation, are not expected to continue.&#13;
Health Care Spending in Second Basic Health Care Project States. The impact of real&#13;
expenditure increases over the past 6 years has remained limited in terms of improvements in health&#13;
status and consumer satisfaction due to the numerous inefficiencies in the allocation between the states&#13;
and among the different programs. In the project states, per capita expenditures in 1993 were estimated&#13;
at average of US$44. With the increase in spending by the proposed project, it is estimated that the&#13;
project would increase annual expenditures by 15 percent, on average, or to about US$52 per capita.&#13;
The impact of the incremental recurrent costs added by the project will be discussed in the following&#13;
section.&#13;
The resources of the SSA are neither targeted to the poorest states nor allocated to the&#13;
programs which would have the greatest health impact per dollar spent. Figure 3 displays the how the&#13;
Basic Health Care II project states deviate from national average per capita SSA spending. The project&#13;
states receive between 25 to 50 percent fewer resources per capita than the national average, despite&#13;
the fact that the burden of disease in these states is significantly higher than the national average. The&#13;

allocation of resources to the states also does not consider the revenue generating capacity of the state,&#13;
as the states with the highest revenues per capita from taxation also receive higher per capita resources&#13;
from the SSA. The Second Basic Health Care Project would continue the targeting approach initiated&#13;
under the First Basic Health Care Project to address many of these issues by directing additional&#13;
resources to the poorest states.&#13;
III. Sustainability of Project Recurrent Costs.&#13;
As discussed in previous sections, federal allocations to the health sector have been increasing&#13;
steadily over the past six years. The ability to continue increasing health spending is constrained,&#13;
however, by the government's macroeconomic strategies which aim to limit public sector spending and&#13;
to improve the efficiency of public sector institutions.  In addition to the need to improve efficiency&#13;
and equity in the allocation of federal resources and to improve the quality of service provision, it is&#13;
essential that future investments in the sector are in-line with the government's ability to finance health&#13;
care provision. The proposed project would address these two issues by improving efficiency and&#13;
equity in the allocation of resources by promoting decentralization of resources and decision-making&#13;
and directly targeting the poorest states with additional resources. By channeling investment to the&#13;
priority health districts within these states and maintaining recurrent costs within the range of expected&#13;
annual expenditure increases within the states, the proposed project would increase efficiency while&#13;
ensuring that the proposed investment is sustainable over the medium- to long-term.&#13;
Table 3 shows the current distribution of spending within the project states, in comparison to&#13;
the incremental recurrent costs that the would be added by the project. In sum, the proposed project&#13;
would add US$34 million annually to the budgets of the project states. In comparison to the current&#13;
spending levels in the states, the burden of these expenditures would remain below 10 percent per year&#13;
in the project states. Expenditures on salaries for incremental fixed-term staff and a small share of&#13;
total expenditures, which are estimated at US$13.1 million, would be absorbed by the SSA at the&#13;
federal level. As a share of the total recurrent budget of the SSA, these expenditures would amount to&#13;
approximately 3 percent. As a share of current federal SSA spending on recurrent resources, the total&#13;
recurrent costs of the proposed project would account for 0.24 percent.  It is expected that the&#13;
incremental costs would be absorbed into the annual budgets of the state health authorities and the SSA&#13;
at the federal level.  Moreover, it is expected that part of these and future resources would be&#13;
generated through cost savings, expected contributions from state governments, which would be&#13;
expected to contribute up to 25 percent of the annual operating and investment budgets of the SSA, and&#13;
the generation of new sources of revenue.&#13;

IV. The Budgeting Process.&#13;
Tlhe budget of the central government is divided into 26 main budgetary categories, or Ramos,&#13;
each one corresponding to a line ministry. The budget of the SSA is composed of resources from two&#13;
of these budgetary categories, which together account for over 85 percent of the annual revenues of the&#13;
SSA. The standard annual budget of the SSA, which includes resources for salaries, operating costs,&#13;
and a small share of investment, is distributed through Ramo Xfl. The second budget account through&#13;
which the SSA receives resources is Ramo XXVI. At the central level, Ramo XXVI is the budget&#13;
mechanism for the PRONASOL program which promotes investment in infrastructure and&#13;
rehabilitation in the poorest states in a number of sectors; as a share of the total PRONASOL budget,&#13;
the health sector accounts for only 12 percent5. In addition, the federal resources included under Ramo&#13;
XXVI are matched by local (state) contributions of approximately 25 percent.&#13;
The key differences between Rawno XI and Ramo XXVI is the manner in which the projects are&#13;
programmed and how the resources flow to the states for execution. Under Ramo XIi, the annual&#13;
budget is prepared on a historical basis under strict guidelines from the SSA at the federal level, with&#13;
little opportunity to alter significantly - neither qualitatively nor quantitatively - the program from the&#13;
previous year. Only approximately 20 percent of the total resources are managed by the state level:&#13;
the federal level pays salaries, purchases drugs and supplies, decides on the allocation between&#13;
programs, and makes all human resource decisions. In contrast, the PRONASOL (Ramo XXVI)&#13;
prepares the annual investment program at the local level where proposals are evaluated by state&#13;
planning commissions (COPLADEs) and then channels the resources directly to the local level where&#13;
5Resources included under Ramo XXVI excluded recurrent costs, until the First Basic Health Care Project modified the&#13;
operating procedures to allow operating costs of the the project to be included with the objective of improving die flow of&#13;
resources to the state.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57                                        ANNEX 3&#13;
HEALTH CARE FINANCE&#13;
the municipalities have significant autonomy to contact providers and make resource allocation&#13;
decisions under the supervision of the federal level.&#13;
Despite the apparently more fluid flow of resources described above under the Ramo XXVI&#13;
mechanism, the separation of the resources for the SSA and the First Basic Health Care Project created&#13;
a numerous delays during the implementation of the First Basic Health Care Project. First, the number&#13;
of steps required to present and approve health projects under Ramo XXVI is excessively long and&#13;
administratively inefficient. Second, poor planning at the state level often precludes decision-makers&#13;
from allocating resources before the current year's tax revenues have been generated, given the need&#13;
for state participation. Third, the heavy involvement of the State Planning Committees (COPLADE),&#13;
in terms of defining priorities and allocating resources, often delayed the presentation of the year's&#13;
project proposals thereby resulting in a shortened implementation period for the respective First Basic&#13;
Health Care Project state.&#13;
On the Ramo XII side, the main problems are related to the centralized nature of the budgeting&#13;
mechanism and the lack of information on the expenditures and performance of prior years. Current&#13;
budgetary practices, which are based on a historical basis and outdated program targets, provide no&#13;
incentive to improve overall efficiency; moreover, the lack of a link between program output and the&#13;
estimated budget needs makes it difficult to program annual expenditures, and even more difficult to&#13;
evaluate the impact of a given program, or expenditure, in order to determine if the investment should&#13;
be made in the place of other potential investments. Only recently have the state level authorities&#13;
begun the process of estimating resource needs for planning-purposes. The basic package described in&#13;
this annex would provide the basic framework from which the project states would be able to select&#13;
cost-effective interventions. The basic guidelines for allocating investment have been developed by the&#13;
government along with the indicators to measure performance. In the future, it is possible that the&#13;
basic package, which has been estimated at between US$50 and US$60 per capita, could serve as a&#13;
means to allocate resources per capita to a given region. This alternative financing mechanism would&#13;
encourage efficiency, as long as adequate controls are established to measure performance and mitigate&#13;
the risk of a decline in quality.&#13;
The financing mechanism described above is one mechanism to decentralize financial resources&#13;
to the SHAs. Decentralization of functions and resources is expected to increase efficiency in resource&#13;
allocation and increase accountability and transparency of sector spending. The current government&#13;
has completed a comprehensive analysis of the sector with the cooperation of the Bank, IDB and&#13;
PAHO, which presents alternative strategies to increase efficiency, quality and effectiveness, Reducing&#13;
administrative costs, improving resource allocation mechanisms, and revising the norms and&#13;
regulations of the SSA to increase flexibility of resource allocation, would allow the health system to&#13;
use the same level of resources to provide even greater health benefits to the population.&#13;
V. Strengthening the Budgeting Process&#13;
Although the separation of financing sources for the First Basic Health Care Project discussed in&#13;
the previous section was envisioned to facilitate the flow of resources, the centralized nature of the SSA's&#13;
budget and delays in the preparation and authorization of annual budget plans on the part of SEDESOL&#13;
has impeded the flow of resources to the states. The proposed project would strengthen the existing&#13;
budgeting mechanisms by consolidating the resources under Ramo XI. Annual, or bi-annual, budgets&#13;
would be prepared at the health district level with the support of the PCU and submitted to a advisory&#13;
committee for financing under the budget category Ramo X1I. The main objectives of the new mechanisms&#13;
would be to increase flexibility, decentralize project planning and execution, and increase budgetary&#13;
transparency at the federal and state levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                                        ANNEX 3&#13;
HEALTH CARE FINANCE&#13;
The financing mechanism would also introduce elements of competition into the budgeting process&#13;
and incentives to execute the budget efficiently by encouraging the health districts to compete annually for&#13;
a fixed level of resources and then by evaluating the performance of the health districts and states in&#13;
carrying-out the year's proposal. The financing mechanisms has been defined by SCHP, in collaboration&#13;
with the SSA, NAFIN and the PCU of the current Basic Health Care Project. In order to reduce the delays&#13;
experienced with the current separation between the budgets of the SSA and SEDESOL, the SHCP has&#13;
authorized the use of the Second Basic Health Care Project budgeting mechanism for the execution of the&#13;
1995 budget of the First Basic Health Care Project (Loan 3272-ME). The lessons learned from other Bank&#13;
projects that utilize similar investment funds indicate that the decentralized planning and execution of the&#13;
resources proposed for the Second Basic Health Care Project investment fund would: (1) reduce the delays&#13;
in the flow of resources; (ii) increase efficiency in spending since the local levels are better informed about&#13;
the actual needs; and (iii) strengthen decision-making at the local level.&#13;
Description of Flow of Project Funds.&#13;
The proposed health investment fund would reverse the more centralized nature of the financing&#13;
mechanisms used under the First Basic Health Care Project by designing projects from the local level and&#13;
then transferring the resources directly to state level banks to be executed by the jurisdictions. Figure 4&#13;
describes the flow of resources and the institutions involved in the operation of the health investment fund.&#13;
Figure I in Annex 7 also identifies the timeframe in which the action would be implemented. Once&#13;
approved, the resources would be included in the annual budget along with matching funds from the state&#13;
governments. The PCU and the SSA would then prepare an annual expenditure schedule for each state to&#13;
be financed with resources from Second Basic Health Care Project.&#13;
In accordance with the expenditure schedule, counterpart resources would be transferred from the&#13;
federal government's IDB-IBRD external credit account to a Second Basic Health Care Project account&#13;
established in a state bank. The State Health Authorities would then present authorization for payments&#13;
directly to the state banks, under the guidelines established by NAFIN. Disbursement eligibility would&#13;
initially be determined by the state banks, although all disbursements would be reviewed ex-ante by the&#13;
SSA at the state and central level and ex-post by the NAFIN. The proposed operating guidelines for the&#13;
health investment fund are described in the following section.&#13;
The process of presenting autorizacion c.e pago (AP - payment authorizations) would be carried&#13;
out by the PCU, which would present the AP to the bank. The state bank, which would be selected from a&#13;
series of qualified banks defined by NAFIN, would then submit electronically to NAFIN the proposed AP&#13;
for authorization. Within a period of no more than 8 days, NAFIN would receive and return the&#13;
authorization to a private Bank located in the state and the resources would be made available in the bank&#13;
in the project states to pay contractors or for use by the State Health Authorities.&#13;

BASIC HEALTH&#13;
CARE PACKAGE&#13;
TfEE BASIC HEALTH CARE PACKAGE&#13;
Mexico is one of the few countries that already defined a national basic package of&#13;
interventions to be offered to those populations currently without access to health services. While&#13;
many countries have begun to calculate their respective burden of disease, so far only Colombia and&#13;
the state of Oregon advanced in the definition and partial implementation of a basic package of cost-&#13;
effective interventions, accessible to all citizens  to reduce the  burden of disease, measured in&#13;
Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).&#13;
It was established through the assessment of the specific burden of disease for Mexico and the&#13;
formulation of a series of cost-effective public health and essential clinical interventions, chosen to&#13;
reduce morbidity and mortality and hence reduce the burden of disease and increase life expectancy.&#13;
The cost-benefit calculations were based on the model suggested by the Bank's 1993 WDR (Investing&#13;
in Health) using the concept of "Disability Adjusted Life Years" (DALYs). The concept is further&#13;
elaborated in: FUNSALUD: "El paquete universal de servicios de salud", Documento #11 para el&#13;
analisis y la convergencia, 1994.&#13;
Implemented on a national basis, the package would reduce 2.5 million DALYs until the year&#13;
2000, 65 percent through essential clinical services and 35 percent through public health interventions&#13;
and health education. This would represent a reduction of 20 percent of the burden of disease in terms&#13;
of total DALYs observed in 1991. The individual costs of specific interventions were obtained&#13;
through the analysis of fixed and variable costs which currently incur for the national health system,&#13;
including the social security institutions. The estimated cost of the Basic Health Care Package is based&#13;
on the marginal cost of extending PHC services to the uncovered population. As an average, total cost&#13;
were divided into 80 percent fixed costs and 20 percent variable costs. Fixed costs were defined as&#13;
salaries and medical equipment, variable costs were defined as the direct costs of the basic package,&#13;
transport costs and the maintenance of the installed infrastructure. For the costs of the implementation&#13;
of the basic package, the population universe without current access to health was determined for five&#13;
zones in the country; and an average grade of marginalization and average existing health coverage was&#13;
assumed. For the purpose of the proposed project, the basic health care package would be delivered in&#13;
the entire zone V, characterized by very high grade of marginalization (Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero,&#13;
Hidalgo, Veracruz, Puebla) and five of the nine states in zone IV (Zacatecas, San Luis Potosf,&#13;
Yucatan, Campeche, Michoacan). Demographic data were projected for 1995 by the National Center&#13;
for Population and Health Studies. If the package were to be implemented in all states, benefiting a&#13;
population of 15 million without current access to health services, total cost would amount to US$790&#13;
million, or US$ 66 per capita per year.&#13;
The cost for the delivery of the complete package is US$66 per capita per year (76 percent for essential&#13;
clinical services and 24 percent for public health interventions). As a national priority, the SSA aims&#13;
to assure access to the Basic Package for the entire uninsured population (15 million in 1994) until the&#13;
year 2000.&#13;

LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.    The preparation of this project took into account lessons learned from the on-going First&#13;
Basic Health Care Project and other Bank-financed health care projects. The most important and&#13;
successful innovations of the First Basic Health Care Project are as follows: At the state level it has&#13;
(a) built the capacity to plan annual investment plans and budgets; (b) transferred from the federal&#13;
level to the states budget, procurement, supervision, training and manpower planning functions; (c)&#13;
introduced monitoring and evaluation systems and annual project audits which review physical and&#13;
financial implementation; (d) provided technical assistance to the states to improve their&#13;
management and technical capacity to implement health care programs. Through its annual and&#13;
mid-term reviews process, the project provided the flexibility needed to make adjustments in&#13;
project design to meet specific needs of individual states or programs. These positive lessons will&#13;
be incorporated in the proposed project and will be implemented in the new project states.&#13;
2.     At the same time, the implementation of the First Basic Health Care Project and other Bank-&#13;
financed projects have been affected adversely by the following factors, which have been taken into&#13;
consideration for the proposed project design:&#13;
3.     Executing Agencies Commitment, Inter-agency Coordination and Implementation&#13;
Capacity: Some projects, including the First Basic Health Care Project, have experienced problems&#13;
in implementation due to lack of full commitment of the implementing agencies, their insufficient&#13;
implementation capacity, or both. In the case of the First Basic Health Care Project, this situation&#13;
was aggravated by high turnover of management staff at the federal level and changes in state&#13;
governments which in turn led to changes in the management staff at the state level. As a result,&#13;
there is a need for constant training of new staff, often leading to unnecessary changes in project&#13;
priorities.&#13;
4.    In the case of the proposed Second Basic Health Care project, state health authorities have&#13;
actively participated in the project preparation process from the beginning. They have a clear&#13;
understanding of current institutional constraints, and have been active partners in the analysis of&#13;
organizational and managerial problems and in the selection of solutions. States would prepare&#13;
annual investment programs by selecting investments from a menu of subprojects prepared by the&#13;
SSA in consultation with the states. Therefor, change of state officials would not minimize their&#13;
commitment to the project: new officials can prepare new investment programs annually.  In&#13;
addition, to improve project ownership and minimize the effects of frequent turnover of managerial&#13;
staff at federal and state levels, project preparation incorporated the jurisdictional level, where the&#13;
staff is less affected by changes and are closer to the target population. This involvement has&#13;
already created a climate of receptiveness on the part of state and municipal governments and&#13;
health staff towards the proposed project. Lastly, to improve the implementation capacity of the&#13;
executing agencies, the role and responsibilities of the existing First Basic Health Care Project&#13;
coordination unit (PCU) was revised to provide more effective technical assistance to the states.&#13;
5.    Financing Mechanisms: The First Basic Health Care Project financed project investment&#13;
plans under three budget categories: (i) the SEDESOL budget, (ii) the SSA budget and (iii)&#13;
contributions of the state governments. Although this separation was envisioned to facilitate the&#13;
flow of resources to the states, the centralized nature of SSA's budget and delays in the preparation&#13;
and authorization of annual budgets by the SEDESOL impeded a timely flow of funds to the states.&#13;
The excessive number of steps to be followed by the project executing agencies from the&#13;
preparation of the annual investment plans to authorization and release of funds, reduced the time&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75                                ANNEX 6&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
frame for implementation of the annual work plans to an average of five months. At the state level,&#13;
the flow of funds for the project was impeded by the unwillingness to commit state government&#13;
resources due to a lack of flexibility in the use of the resources during the fiscal year and poor&#13;
revenue forecasting resulting in lower than expected resource levels. State contribution was higher&#13;
in those states where state health authorities negotiated with the state government to finance&#13;
specific project activities, such as training of local health workers, construction, rehabilitation or&#13;
maintenance of infrastructure.&#13;
6.     To address the above problems, the proposed Second Basic Health Care Project would&#13;
consolidate the financing sources of the federal government under Ramo XII and directly channel&#13;
resources to the state level using a new financing mechanism described in Annex 3. The main&#13;
objectives of the investment fund would be to shorten the period for review of the state's work&#13;
program and budget proposals, increase flexibility, decentralize project planning and&#13;
irnplementation. Regarding the state government c,witributioxt, , Le state health authorities would&#13;
have to negotiate with the state governments ihose activities or programs that would be funded by&#13;
the states. In addition, the project targets for both tle federal and the state governments would be&#13;
separated in the project accounting system to allow for greater transparency in the allocation and&#13;
use of state funds and to provide incentives for the state governments to make timely contributions.&#13;
7.    Project Investment in Infrastructure.   The First Basic Health Care Project has&#13;
demonstrated that large project investment in infrastructure is not enough to improve health sector&#13;
performance; complementary measures are needed. There should be strengthened management&#13;
capacity to implement priority health programs, supervision systems should be carefully designed&#13;
to facilitate on-the-job training; norms and procedures should be flexible enough to facilitate health&#13;
programs' implementation.  In line with this, a well designed information system  must be&#13;
established for rapidly detecting issues and problems; the system should also assist managers to&#13;
take action to maximize health sector productivity. The Second Basic Health Care Project will focus&#13;
less on infrastructure, but will provide to the states the resources needed to continue to implement&#13;
and improve support systems such as supervision; procurement, stock control and distribution of&#13;
drugs; epidemiological surveillance and financing, accounting and control and management&#13;
information systems (MIS). These actions are expected to contribute to the improvement of the&#13;
efficiency and quality of service delivery.&#13;
8.    Related to the above, in the construction and rehabilitation of health facilities, some Bank-&#13;
financed projects ended up with poor quality construction due to inexperienced contractors and&#13;
inappropriate building designs for the project areas. The implementation of the First Basic Health&#13;
Care Project faced similar experiences. Large contractors from Mexico City would be responsive&#13;
to the local competitive bidding process, but had no experience in the construction of health&#13;
structure in peri-urban or rural areas. As a result, construction was often not completed on time,&#13;
or when completed was often of poor quality, whereas, a study on school construction under the&#13;
Municipal Funds demonstrated that schools constructed by communities or local contractors, cost&#13;
less than one-half the cost of the federally contracted schools. The same study revealed that in the&#13;
TEscuela Digna' school rehabilitation program, community participation and quality of these&#13;
simple works were very high when properly supervised. In the Second Basic Health Care Project,&#13;
the procurement of civil works program will allow for greater participation of local communities&#13;
and small contractors in the construction of health infrastructure of a smaller scale, particularly in&#13;
rural communities and remote areas. Instead of relying on the project coordinating unit or the&#13;
federal or state health services, supervision of the civil works component will be done by hiring&#13;
local private contractors. In addition, state health officials would be trained for administrative and&#13;
financial supervision of this component. This system which is already used in the First Basic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76                                ANNEX 6&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
Health Care Project for the hospital rehabilitation program has shown to be very effective. The&#13;
proposed civil works program would be based on an infrastructure micro planning study of already&#13;
completed for the on-going First Basic Health Care Project. A similar study is currently in process&#13;
for the new project states.&#13;
9.     Staff Mix and Assignment in Remote Areas: Health projects have faced problems of&#13;
inadequate staff mix, poor training for auxiliary health workers, and lack of qualified staff in&#13;
hardship or remote areas. A problem for both developing and developed countries alike is the&#13;
resistance by health staff to move to and remain in hardship or remote areas. Past experience in&#13;
other countries with the reassignment of health staff to remote areas has had only limited results in&#13;
the absence of appropriate incentives. In the proposed project, staff incentives (financial resources&#13;
and career advancement) will be introduced on an experimental basis. As started in the on-going&#13;
First Basic Health Care Project, the proposed new project will also continue to support the training&#13;
of local health workers (TAPS) for the delivery of health services in remote areas. The supervision&#13;
system for these workers will be strengthened to provide them on-the-job training for the delivery&#13;
of quality services.&#13;
10.   Project Sustainability:  Several project evaluation reports noted that the inability of&#13;
governments to continue financing recurrent costs limited the effect of projects to the length of&#13;
their implementation. In the proposed project, new staff requirements were kept to a minimum;&#13;
moreover, the SSA in each state would prepare a staff rationalization plan to be implemented&#13;
during the first two years of project implementation. Expansion of services and improvements in&#13;
quality would be accompanied by the rationalization in the employment and distribution of staff. In&#13;
addition, sustainability will be improved by introducing reform of financing mechanisms, which are&#13;
intended to rationalize expenditures and improve efficiency in the state health program and finding&#13;
alternative models of delivery and financing of services. Moreover, improvement of management&#13;
capacity and devolving important decision-making functions to the states and jurisdictional levels&#13;
should result in more savings on recurrent costs.&#13;
11.   Monitoring and Evaluation: Projects in the past have suffered from the lack of explicit&#13;
indicators to measure progress and end-results. The proposed project takes advantage of the&#13;
implementation of the monitoring and evaluation system of the on-going project, by improving it&#13;
with further rationalization and computerization and combine it with the epidemiological&#13;
surveillance system to monitor the effects of the health delivery services on health conditions of the&#13;
local population.&#13;

THE PREPARATION AND SELECTION OF SUB-PROJECTS&#13;
I. Introduction.&#13;
The Mexican government has developed a basic package of cost-effective interventions designed&#13;
to maximize the health impact per dollar spent.  The proposed project would promote the&#13;
implementation of the Mexican Basic Package by financing projects designed by the jurisdictional level&#13;
health authorities, using the basic package as the framework for investment. Compared to the current&#13;
centralized programming and budgeting mechanisms used by the SSA, the proposed project cycle&#13;
would decentralize many of the decision-making functions with respect to the annual programs and&#13;
investments within the project states. At the same time, the role of the Federal SSA would be&#13;
strengthened in order to assume a more normative and policy oriented role to guide and provide&#13;
technical assistance to the project states during project preparation and implementation. The objective&#13;
of the proposed subproject preparation cycle would be to increase flexibility, decentralize project&#13;
planning and execution, and increase budgetary transparency at the federal and state levels.&#13;
Lessons learned from other Bank projects that utilize similar planning and financing&#13;
mechanisms indicate that the decentralized planning and execution of the resources proposed for Basic&#13;
Health Care II would reduce the delays in the flow of resources, increases efficiency in spending, as the&#13;
local levels are better informed about the actual needs, and strengthen decision-making at the local&#13;
level.&#13;
II. The Design and Selection of Second Basic Health Care Projects.&#13;
During project preparation, 60 jurisdictions have been selected within the I I project states. To&#13;
promote decentralization, the jurisdictions, in collaboration with the State Health Authorities and&#13;
technical assistance from the PCU, would be responsible for preparing projects eligible for financing&#13;
under the Second Basic Health Care Project. Projects would be designed on an annual, or bi-annual,&#13;
basis using the basic package identified by the Mexican government as a framework for investment.&#13;
Sub-projects, which would fall within the list of interventions identified by the package, would be&#13;
eligible for financing on a competitive basis. To establish the annual programs that would be financed,&#13;
the jurisdictions and states would follow standard operational procedures. The steps described below in&#13;
points (a) to (g) are also displayed graphically in Figure 1. The basic steps would include following&#13;
steps:&#13;
(a)   Identification. The health authorities at the jurisdictional level, in coordination with&#13;
the project coordinating units (PCUs) at both the federal and the state levels, would identify the&#13;
priority health problems in terms of morbidity and mortality, and the cost-effectiveness of the&#13;
intervention. The initial analysis necessary for project identification would begin in March or&#13;
April of each year.&#13;
(b)    Project Preparation. According to the needs assessment completed in step (a), the&#13;
health jurisdictions would prepare annual subproject proposals using the basic package as a&#13;
guideline for project preparation.  The completed proposal would then be submitted to the&#13;
State Health Authorities and the PCU for prior review. The preparation phase would be&#13;
completed by the first half of July.&#13;
&#13;

PREPARATION AND SELECTON&#13;
OF SUB-PROJECTS&#13;
(c)    Technical Review. The PCU at the federal level would review all the proposals&#13;
submitted by each of the 11 project states according to the criteria defined in the Operating&#13;
Manual. For those projects that meet the basic criteria, the PCU would prepare an estimated&#13;
annual budget and expenditure schedule and submit all of the proposals to the federal Advisory&#13;
Committee. It is estimated that the proposal would be submitted in the first half of August of&#13;
each year.&#13;
(d)    Approval at Federal Level. It would be the responsibility of the Advisory Committee&#13;
to consider the proposals submitted by each of the 11 project states and to select the sub-&#13;
projects that would be financed by the available annual resources. The approval would be&#13;
based on the selection criteria identified in section B and C of this annex and the additional&#13;
elements outlined in the Operational Manual. Approval by the Advisory Committee would be&#13;
given by the second half of August, at which point the SSA-Budget Office would authorize the&#13;
budget resources necessary for the subsequent years.&#13;
(e)   Implementation. Once approved, the states would be notified of the sub-projects and&#13;
the annual budget approved by the Advisory Committee. The State Health Authorities in&#13;
coordination with the Health Jurisdictions would be responsible for implementing the projects.&#13;
Implementation would begin once the official authorization of the budgetary resources is&#13;
finalized in early January.&#13;
(f)    Evaluation.  Procedures and routines for evaluation would be followed as outlined in&#13;
the Operation Manual for Second Basic Health Care Project. The PCU, at the federal and state&#13;
levels, in addition to independent academic and private institutions would be responsible for&#13;
evaluating the performance and impact of the project.&#13;
&#13;

The actual design and preparation of project proposals would be developed according to a&#13;
standardized model, which is described below. These projects would then be ranked according to&#13;
the criteria described in section C and then selected for financing by the Basic Health Care II.&#13;
A. Model of Subproject Design.&#13;
The project proposals would be prepared by the Health Districts on an annual basis and then submitted&#13;
by the state level authorities to the Federal Advisory Committee and the PCU for evaluation and approval. The&#13;
projects would be prepared using the basic guidelines described in the box on the following page. According to&#13;
the guidelines the proposal submitted must fall into the following four categories: (i) primary health care; (ii)&#13;
local institutional strengthening and research; (iii) infrastructure necessary to carry-out the delivery of the basic&#13;
package; and (iv) vertical programs that fall outside of the basic package would be financed only if financing is&#13;
justified on the basis of cost-effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

PREPARATION AND SELECTON&#13;
OF SUB-PROJECTS&#13;
* Primary health care: The component will support primary health care projects, provided that they are&#13;
completed within a basic package of interventions defined as having high impact and/or cost-benefit and&#13;
which are aimed at dealing with those health problems that are considered as priorities. fInnovative or&#13;
expermnental projects using local initiative, can be submitted, provided that they are primary health care&#13;
projects based on a solid technical justification. Jurisdictional and state subprojects proposals should&#13;
target municipalities and regions using the INEGI poverty index and epidemiological indicators.&#13;
* Local institutional develooment and local research:  The component will support institutional&#13;
developmnent proposals at state, district or local level, provided that they are aimed at achieving greater&#13;
efficiency in the operation, supervision, training and evaluation of basic health care. The component will&#13;
support those subprojects prepared by the project states and the selected health jurisdictions in which the&#13;
active participation and commitment of the authorities has been assured. Local operational research&#13;
projects can be submitted for funding if the expected results are expected to be used for local decision&#13;
malkng to solve priority health problems.&#13;
* Infrastructure: Authorization for civil works would be given only in those cases where the proposal&#13;
justifies the need for infrastructure for the delivery of the basic health care package., Investment&#13;
expenditures for new infrastructure will be authorized for the primary care level, provided that the new&#13;
unit's operation and maintenance are guaranteed. Expenditures for rehabilitating and supplying primary&#13;
level units will only be authorized if the establishment of a working, efficient maintenance. system is.&#13;
guaranteed. In the case of projects that consider expenditures for hospitals (secondary leveli of care),&#13;
proposals will only be approved in exceptional cases, where the investment directly supports the primary&#13;
level of health care, for example in the case of a patient referral and counter-referral system.&#13;
Expenditures for specialized tertiary care hospitals will not be authorized for fimding under this project.'&#13;
Funds authorized under the yearly investment plan must may not be used for emergency situations.&#13;
* Funds managed by the state: Proposals for funding vertical health programs managed by the state,as&#13;
opposed to those implemented by health jurisdictions can be submitted only if they demonstrate greater.&#13;
cost-iciency than local interventions.  However, the state may submit proposals for funding of&#13;
operating and investment expenditures related to supervision, evaluation, technical assistance: and&#13;
financial control of jurisdictional projects&#13;
B. Format for Subproject Proposals&#13;
During project preparation, the jurisdictions and the states would be required to supply basic&#13;
information that would be used be included in the proposals and form the basic criteria for project&#13;
selection. The following sections outlines the basic infonnation that each subproject should contain&#13;
and the criteria that would be applied during evaluation by the Federal Advisory Committee. The&#13;
operational manual would contain detailed guidelines for the evaluation process regarding the&#13;
selection of appropriate subprojects, using the following questions:&#13;
A. Nature of the problem&#13;
1)   General description of the type of population with this problem.&#13;

PROJECT COSTS&#13;
AND FINANCING&#13;
GOODS AND SERVICES FINANCED BY THE PROJECT&#13;
(a) Civil Works: The project would improve the basic health network through financing those civil works&#13;
which contribute to the delivery of the Basic Health Care package. The needs of each state will be carefully&#13;
reviewed in a diagnostic survey. Special emphasis will be placed on rehabilitation of existing infrastructure as&#13;
opposed to new construction. The local community would be involved for construction and rehabilitation of&#13;
small civil works in remote municipalities (rural health posts, additions of birth centers, "casas de salud')&#13;
and will be supported under the project.&#13;
(b) Vehicles: The purchase of vehicles will be supported by this component with regard to the acquisition of&#13;
primary care mobile units for reaching those communities without health infrastructure and ambulances for&#13;
referring patients from first level to higher level care facilities. No other vehicles will be financed through&#13;
the project due to reserved procurement.&#13;
(c)  Equipment,  pharmaceuticals  and  medical supplies:    Basic  medical equipment, essential&#13;
pharmaceuticals, vaccines and medical supplies necessary for the delivery of the Basic Health package will be&#13;
financed under the project. For this purpose, the project would use the essential drug and equipment lists&#13;
which were already .reviewed and approved by the Bank for the ongoing First Basic Health Care Project.&#13;
(d) Fixed-term staff, technical assistance and training: The project will only finance only fixed term&#13;
health staff positions. There will be no incremental staff as a result of this project (no "plazas", regular SSA&#13;
positions, would be created). Major emphasis will be placed on the training of TAPS (Tecnicos de Atenci6n&#13;
Primaria a la Salud), which are recruited from the same community where they will serve after having&#13;
received specific training in primary care. In addition, incentive schemes for attracting doctors for rural&#13;
communities would be financed under the project. The component would also finance technical training for&#13;
both health care personnel, the informal sector (traditional midwives) and community members (mothers). A&#13;
basic training program was agreed upon during appraisal.&#13;
(e) Supervision: Supervision will play an integral part in the delivery of the Basic Health Care package and&#13;
would be financed under this component. The supervision system supported under First Basic Health Care&#13;
Project would be improved and expanded into the new project states. The supervision teams would be&#13;
composed by a medical doctor, a nurse and a technician/driver. Those teams are based in the health&#13;
jurisdictions and are in charge of integral supervision of health post and centers in monthly visits. The&#13;
improved supervision strategy would be adjusted to the individual needs and conditions in each project states&#13;
and will be described in the operational manual.&#13;

MONITORING AND&#13;
EVALUATION INDICATORS&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION INDICATORS&#13;
I. Indicators for the Basic Health Component:&#13;
Project Performance will be measured by quantitative and qualitative performance indicators,&#13;
as well as a set of outcome indicators. It has to be understood that indicators are not only influenced&#13;
by the project's interventions; on the one hand, factors outside the project's intervention may influence&#13;
indicators, on the other hand, different interventions may influence the same indicator.&#13;
A. Quantitative and Qualitative Performance Indicators:&#13;
Project performance can be measured through coverage, reflecting a proportion of the target&#13;
population receiving a health service or engaging in a specific program. The proposed coverage&#13;
indicators serve as well as placeholders for overall service performance and quality. They constitute&#13;
the minimum requirements for health services. If those indicators are not of acceptable quality, it is&#13;
likely that more sophisticated services are not available as well.&#13;
B. Outcome Indicators:&#13;
Outcome indicators are more closely tied to the objectives of the project. They are less&#13;
specific, less sensitive and will improve only after some delay, but they are more robust. The&#13;
complementary and simultaneous evaluation of both performance and outcome indicators shows if a&#13;
project is on target.&#13;
The following indicators represent an example which should be costume tailored to the specific&#13;
activities of the subproject and the epidemiological needs of the target area. They are divided in (i)&#13;
coverage indicators, reflecting the outreach capability of services for the most vulnerable groups and&#13;
for the most cost-effective interventions and (ii) outcome indicators showing an improvement in health&#13;
outcomes, departing from baseline indicators to be assessed prior to project implementation. They&#13;
include data on institutional development, reflecting advances in personnel training and institutional&#13;
processes and data on the progress in the rehabilitation and construction of infrastructure to support the&#13;
delivery of a basic health package.&#13;

Component:&#13;
Through this component, studies on topics such as health financing and resource&#13;
mobilization, quality of care, administration and decentralization issues, health policy studies,&#13;
specific pilot testing of new health care models and project monitoring and impact evaluation will&#13;
be conducted. Specific indicators will be reviewed and agreed upon during the annual review of the&#13;
work program and the specific terms of reference of applied research, studies and pilot project.&#13;
The PCU, jointly with the SSA will be in charge to prepare annual work programs and terms of&#13;
reference, including productivity indicators, satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;

MONITORING AND&#13;
EVALUATION INDICATORS&#13;
Policv Indicators for the Mexico-Basic Health Care 11 Project:&#13;
Component 1:&#13;
1.     One target jurisdiction per project state will have executed an investment project by 12/31 1996 and&#13;
at least two target jurisdiction per project state will present a new investment subproject for CY 1997.&#13;
2.     All 57 jurisdictions in the target areas of the 11 project states will have presented and executed and&#13;
evaluated at least one investment project by the time of the midterm review (10/1998).&#13;
3.     At least 150 jurisdictional subprojects in 57 jurisdictions in 11 project states should have been&#13;
approved, financed and evaluated according to the guidelines of the Operational Manual during the&#13;
implementation period of the project (1996-2000).&#13;
4.     At least 90% of the installed health infrastructure in the project areas for first and second level care&#13;
should be functional, adequately equipped and adequately staffed by either TAPS or medical personnel using&#13;
the project's incentive scheme for hardship areas by the end of the project (12/2000). A maintenance plan&#13;
involving states-jurisdictions and municipalities should be implemented by 12/98.&#13;
5.     Of the population in the project jurisdictions which currently has no access to basic health services, at&#13;
least 50% should gain access to basic curative and preventive services by 12/98 (measured through first time&#13;
visits of patients without prior access to curative services and first time services of preventive outreach&#13;
campaigns), and at least 90% should gain access to basic services until the end of the project by 12/2000.&#13;
6.     At least 60% of randomly surveyed clients of first and second level care facilities in the project area&#13;
should be satisfied with the overall quality of services rendered by midterm (10/98) and at least 75% of&#13;
patients should express satisfaction by the end of the project (12/2000).&#13;
Component II&#13;
1.    In all 32 states the decentralization units should be in place and have initiated their support for the&#13;
state health services for the transfer of functions from central to state and from state level to jurisdictions&#13;
according to the decentralization chronogram (operational manual) by 12/96.&#13;
2.     The decentralization process should be completed in all 32 states by 12/98 with functions and&#13;
responsibilities transferred to states and jurisdictions as outlined in the decentralization protocol. By 12/98 at&#13;
least 50% of the budget for the procurement of pharmaceuticals, human resources and operating budget&#13;
should be controlled by the states. By 12/2000, this share should increase to at least 80%.&#13;
3.     To guarantee efficient response to organizational challenges and management focus on problem areas,&#13;
at least 50% of state and jurisdictional managerial staff should have received at least one module of&#13;
management training by 12/98. 80% of SSA managerial staff in states and jurisdictions should receive&#13;
management training as offered by the project by 12/2000.&#13;
4.     Through the introduction of new management systems and technical staff profiles, the SSA intends to&#13;
guarantee adequate long-term operation of health services and service administration at the central and state&#13;
levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

MONITORING AND&#13;
EVALUATION INDICATORS&#13;
5.     The flow of funds as outlined in the operational manual should be implemented and operational by&#13;
12/96, managing project funds at the state and jurisdictional levels through Cuentas por Liquidar (CLC's) and&#13;
through bank accounts at the state and jurisdictional levels.&#13;
6.    Integral supervision through specially selected and trained teams should be carried out regularly by&#13;
the states and jurisdictions with periodic input and guidance from the central SSA with emphasis on problem&#13;
solving and capacity building at the local levels should be pilot tested by 12/96 and implemented in all&#13;
project states by 10/98. By the end of the project (12/2000) the experience gained should be transferred to&#13;
the rest of the 32 states.&#13;
Component III&#13;
1.    A new MIS in the fields of health services, procurement and stock control, epidemioiogical&#13;
surveillance, hospital management, and sanitary regulation should be pilot tested by 12/97, implemented in&#13;
1  states by 10/98 and should be fully operational in all states by 12/2000.&#13;
2.     The 11 project states should initiate procurement of pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, of distribution&#13;
and stock services, and consulting services by using standard bidding documents by 12/96 (unless the&#13;
consolidated purchase is more cost effective). The experience should be promoted to other states, and each&#13;
state will be evaluated on their performance in this area by 12/97.&#13;
3.     A new more equitable and rational budget allocation mechanism, departing from historic budget&#13;
allocation should be pilot tested by 12/98, where budget allocation is linked with indicators in states such as&#13;
per capita, uninsured population, installed capacity, burden of disease and epidemiological profile. By&#13;
12/2000 a new budget allocation system should be fully operational.&#13;
4.     Through the help of policy studies, pilot projects and feasibility studies, the SSA should regain&#13;
control of regulatory and oversight functions for the entire health sector. A portfolio of studies and pilot&#13;
projects has been presented to the Bank for implementation in 1996. Policy studies and pilot project&#13;
proposals for 1997-2000 will be reviewed and evaluated and agreed upon annually during the annual review&#13;
meetings.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators:  Project performance will be measured by quantitative and&#13;
qualitative performance indicators and outcome and policy indicators. Indicators generally are not only&#13;
influenced by the project's interventions; on one hand, factors outside the project's intervention may&#13;
influence indicators, on the other hand, different interventions may influence the same indicator.  (a)&#13;
Quantitative and qualitative performance indicators: Project performance can be measured through&#13;
coverage, reflecting a proportion of the target population receiving a health service or engaging in a specific&#13;
program. The proposed coverage indicators serve both as placeholders for overall service performance and&#13;
service quality. They constitute the minimum requirements for health services. If those simple indicators are&#13;
not of acceptable quality (such as the availability of patient records), it is unlikely that more sophisticated&#13;
services are rendered. (b) Outcome indicators: Outcome indicators are more closely tied to the objectives&#13;
of the project. They are more specific but less sensitive and will improve only after some delay, but they are&#13;
in general more robust. The simultaneous evaluation of both performance and outcome indicators monitors if&#13;
a project is on target. Project supervision would be conducted according to an operations manual, which&#13;
includes a chapter on supervision, monitoring and evaluation and prescribes how to use key indicators.&#13;

ECONOMIC BENEFITS&#13;
ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT&#13;
1.    The economic analysis of health sector projects attempts to quantify the efficiency gains that&#13;
will result from  the implementation of the proposed project.  Traditionally, this analysis has&#13;
concentrated on the extension of health services to an uncovered segment of the population, with the&#13;
emphasis on the size of the population that will receive benefits, irrespective of the cost of the project.&#13;
Additional project cost-benefit analysis have attempted to identify the qualitative effects of selected&#13;
project components, such as improved quality of primary health care services. The present analysis,&#13;
however, uses several indicators of the net benefits in terms of the health of the population and the&#13;
resources that will be gained as a result of implementation to identify the economic benefits that will&#13;
accrue as a result of the implementation of the Project.&#13;
2.     Although it is more difficult to quantify economic benefits of health projects due to the long-&#13;
term effects and the high degree of variance related to the economic value of improved health, the&#13;
following section attempts to quantify the monetary returns that will accrue as a result of discrete&#13;
project interventions. On the qualitative benefit side, significant improvements would be expected as&#13;
result of an expansion of the SSA's coverage of health services for the uninsured population and&#13;
structural changes within the SSA that will improve the long-term sustainability of the proposed&#13;
reforms. Specifically, the economic gains from the proposed project can be classified to include: (a)&#13;
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved through the provision of over 100 priority health&#13;
interventions; (b) economic benefits resulting from the decentralization of services and the subsequent&#13;
reduction of administrative costs at the central level; and (c) economic benefits accruing from the&#13;
improvements in the procurement and distribution of pharmaceuticals.&#13;
(A) Economic Benefits of Selected Health Programs&#13;
3.     Based on detailed surveys of the burden of disease and the disability adjusted life years&#13;
(DALYs) estimated by FUNSALUD and the Government of Mexico, this section presents estimates of&#13;
potential DALYs saved in the project states, as a result of public health programs, outreach and&#13;
strengthening of the PHC delivery.  The analysis is measured by the contributions to reduce the&#13;
estimated 12.8 million DALYs lost prematurely in 1991.&#13;
4.     Using the methodology developed by the Bank in the context of the 1993 World Development&#13;
Report "Investing in Health", the study determined the total number of DALYs lost prematurely in&#13;
1991, and the examined over 100 health interventions to establish their effectiveness and costs. These&#13;
analysis were used to determine that the provision of the basic health package to the Mexican&#13;
population could save an estimated 2.5 million DALYs by the 2000. The activities financed by the&#13;
project have all been evaluated as dealing with a significant source of ill health and whose cost per&#13;
DALY saved is less than N$3000 (1991). In addition, each DALY represents an implicit economic&#13;
benefit resulting from the preservation of life, or the increased worker productivity that results from&#13;
the health intervention that allows the worker to return to work. While it is difficult to quantify these&#13;
benefits in monetary terms, the following analysis highlights the expected savings from the delivery of&#13;
the Basic Package in terms of DALYs gained.&#13;
5.     Estimates of the burden of disease by state reveal that approximately 39 percent of all DALYs&#13;
are lost in the states where the project will focus investment in basic health services. It was thereby&#13;
assumed that 39 percent of the potential DALY gained by the year 2000 would accrue to the project&#13;
states. The following table presents the estimated DALYs saved from the three main project&#13;

6.     Taking a conservative estimate of 50 percent effectiveness of the project interventions, the&#13;
investments in the basic health care component would produce expected savings of 469,494 DALYs by&#13;
the year 2000. This represents over 10 percent of the total burden of disease in the project states. In&#13;
addition to DALYs saved, these programs will clearly have a significant impact on productivity of the&#13;
population and on the economy overall. Assuming that the figure of two minimum wages constitutes a&#13;
subsistence income for Mexico, and therefore serves as a proxy for the economic value of each DALY&#13;
gained, the 50 percent assumption of '69,494 DALYs gained can be translated into a Net Present&#13;
Value of $342 million  (938.9 million undiscounted) by the year 20002. In essence, the project is&#13;
buying 469,494 healthy life years for about $335 million (cost of component), for an average cost of&#13;
$713 per disability adjusted life year. In combination with the returns to improved productivity, the&#13;
investment would indicate a fairly high rate of return, as the project benefits would outpace the costs&#13;
over the first 5 years and continue to contril-ute to the health and productivity of the Mexican&#13;
population.&#13;
(B) Economic Benefits of Decentralization and Improved Administration of the SSA&#13;
7.     The proposed project would support a number of activities aimed at fostering decentralized&#13;
delivery and financing of health services and reducing central level bureaucracy of the SSA. The&#13;
institutional strengthening of the state level health services, combined with a restructuring of the SSA&#13;
at the central level, would have a significant impact on reducing the administrative expenditures&#13;
estimated at nearly 25%  of the SSA  budget.  Using a 10 percent potential reduction in the&#13;
administrative expenditures of the SSA as a proxy for the economic outcomes of the component, the&#13;
following table presents various scenarios which reflect the total economic returns over a 5 year&#13;
period.&#13;
8.     Using conservative estimates, the results presented in Table 2 show that the cumulative savings&#13;
from reduced administrative expenditures would reach $94 million during the 5 year period of the&#13;
proposed project. In comparison to the estimated total investment costs of $15 million necessary to&#13;
Analysis based on a target population of 15,145,721 million and an estimated (1991) loss of 4,945,620 DALYs in the&#13;
project states.&#13;
2 The minimum wage in Mexico at the time of writing was approximately US$3 per day. Yearly wages were based on a&#13;
250 day work year, adjusted to reflect the fact that many of the uninsured population is in the unproductive,&#13;
unemployed sector thereby lowering the yearly incomes.&#13;
&#13;

reduce administrative expenditures, the net present value of the proposed interventions, projected over&#13;
a 5 year period, is estimated at $51.2 million. These reductions would allow the SSA to improve&#13;
service delivery at the local level and to dedicate additional resources to the regulatory and control&#13;
functions that will characterize the restr-uctured SSA.&#13;

Estimates include the following assumptions: (i) 1992 administrative expenditures of $3' h mnillion; (ii) a discount rate of 10%;&#13;
(iii) a 50 percent success rate in achieving a 10% reduction in administrative expenditures; and (iv) total investment costs&#13;
include the disbursements considered under loan component Im, excluding project administration and the MIS modules for the&#13;
other components.&#13;
(C) Economic Benefits from Improvements in Procurement and Distribution of Pharmaceuticals&#13;
9.     The proposed project would enhance the logistics and distribution of pharmaceuticals and&#13;
medical supplies, building on the procurement and stock control systems developed during the First&#13;
Basic Health Care project. Based on expert assessments of the pharmaceutical sector, it has been&#13;
estimated that roughly 70 percent of every dollar spent on pharmaceuticals is wasted due to the&#13;
numerous problems in the system.  The estimated loss per dollar spent can be attributed to the&#13;
following areas: (i) expiration and loss, $0.18; (ii) high unit costs, $0.10; high administrative costs,&#13;
$0.02; and (iii) inappropriate use and prescribing, $0.35.&#13;
10.    The project will use these figures and the 1993 estimated SSA expenditure on pharmaceuticals&#13;
of approximately $120 million as baseline data to estimate the potential economic benefits of the&#13;
project. Through the implementation of a procurement and stock control system, the proposed project&#13;
would help to reduce the cost of procuring drugs and supplies and to increase the effectiveness, in&#13;
terms of health status, of each dollar spent on pharmaceuticals.&#13;
11.    The project would attempt to achieve the following reductions:&#13;
* 30% reduction in losses due to product expiration and deterioration in storage&#13;
* 10% reduction in unit costs paid for pharmaceuticals and supplies&#13;
* 15% reduction in operating and administrative costs of the system&#13;
* 20% reduction in inappropriate use, on both the demand and supply sides&#13;
&#13;

12.    These estimated savings have been developed based on successful experiences from the reform&#13;
of pharmaceutical logistics systems in other countries3. Performing sensitivity analysis depending on&#13;
the various possible degrees of success of the project's interventions, the following table presents the&#13;
cumulative savings (benefits) that accrue over the 5 years of the project. Table 3 also presents the net&#13;
present value of the proposed interventions, employing a discount rate of 10 percent over the 5 year&#13;
projection period. Based on the results achieved during the First Basic Health Care project, the&#13;
analysis presented will use a 50 percent implementation success rate.&#13;

Net Present Value: 5 year period                                      9.72       1..... ....    3 .1&#13;
13.    The summary statistics presented in Table 3 assess the likely impact of the project on the&#13;
overall cost of administering the pharmaceutical supply and distribution systems over a 5 year period.&#13;
Using conservative assumptions, it is assumed that 50 percent of the target improvements are achieved&#13;
by each year of the project. According to these estimates the project would yield estimated savings of&#13;
approximately $41 million by year 5 in cumulative savings.   The improved drug supply and&#13;
procurement systems would produce an estimated net present value of $21 million. Based on estimated&#13;
expenditures for the system of $8 million, the net present value of the benefits and cost indicates a high&#13;
rate of return, as the project would potentially pay-back the investment in the first year of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(D) Cost-Benefit Analysis&#13;
14.    The proposed project is expected to engender significant improvements in the health status of about&#13;
15.5 million uninsured people in eleven states through the implementation of a cost-effective basic health care&#13;
package.   By transferring more programming, managing and budgeting responsibilities to states and&#13;
jurisdictions, the project would promote improvements in the efficiency and equity of resource allocation,&#13;
3 Estimated loss per dollar and the potential savings of interventions in the pharmaceutical sectors are based on work by&#13;
Management Sciences for Health and the Nicaragua Health Sector Reform Project 2556-NI.&#13;
4 The net present value employs a 10% discount rate disocunted back over the 5 year period used for the estimates.&#13;
Investment costs are limited to the disbursements for information systems realted to supply and distribution and&#13;
training cost under loan components II and III. The total expected yearly benefit reflects the expected gain on the&#13;
investment, by area of loss, during each year of the project. The total potential savings reflected in column 4,&#13;
however, reflects the sensitivity analysis based on the cummulative savings resulting from the improvements over a 5&#13;
year period.&#13;
&#13;

ECONOMIC BENEFITS&#13;
quality of service delivery and institutional capacity of states and jurisdictions.  The project would also&#13;
modernize and realign the SSA so that it may resume its leadership function in the sector.&#13;
15.    These components would  impact the financial equilibrium  of the health  sector by  reducing&#13;
administrative expenditures of the SSA and improving the health of the uninsured population. Although&#13;
many of the benefits of the project are not amenable to quantitative estimates, a cost-benefit analysis of the&#13;
Basic Health Care component5, improved pharmaceuticals management and reduced administrative&#13;
expenditures of the SSA, reveals that the project would pay back the investment over the five year period of&#13;
the loan. The following table displays the summary results of the quantitative returns of the project.&#13;

16.    Taking a conservative estimate of a 50 percent implementation success rate, the selected project&#13;
components would produce estimated savings of US$1,074 million by the year 2000.  Discounting the&#13;
economic costs and benefits to reflect inflation and uncertainty, the net present value (NPV) of these benefits&#13;
would amount to over US$414 million by the year 2000. Based on estimated expenditures of US$358&#13;
million in the above mentioned areas, the NPV of the benefits and costs indicates a high rate of return, as the&#13;
project would potentially pay back the investment within the five year period of the loan. Furthermore, these&#13;
investments would continue to produce significant gains, both quantitatively and qualitatively, well into the&#13;
next century.&#13;
5 Although the additional investments of the project were not amenable to cost-benefit analysis, it is likely that the NPV of these&#13;
components, in combination with the above analysis, would exceed the total project costs of US$443.4 million.&#13;

CIVIL WORKS&#13;
IMPROVEMENT OF PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    In the First Basic Health Care Project procurement of works was done mostly through LCB and&#13;
shopping by the states PCUs. The review of this experience demonstrates that rural medical facilities in scattered&#13;
areas were not attractive to larger local or national contractors, and therefore some communities endured limitations&#13;
to deliver medical services. Also, decisions on technical proposals were made at the central level thus restricting&#13;
the participation in the process of local medical teams. The review of this experience indicates that increasing their&#13;
participation and accountability, allowing health jurisdictions to establish physical targets in the subprojects, and&#13;
contracting and supervising small works, would effectively accelerate implementation.&#13;
2.     Primary health care infrastructure construction and/or rehabilitation would be implemented by the&#13;
health services in the states (Servicios Coordinados de Salud (SCS)), following two main strategies: the&#13;
community-based model and the state management model. For each subproject including civil works, the&#13;
SCS would select one of the two models depending on the needs, location, access, and capacity of the&#13;
municipality or the community.&#13;
Community-based Model&#13;
The community-based model is a community-based strategy modeled after the successful&#13;
SOLIDARIDAD program, which would be used for the construction and/or rehabilitation of health posts&#13;
(Unidades de Asistencia para a la Salud (UAS)), rural health centers (centros de salud rural dispersos) and&#13;
delivery inns (posadas de nacimiento) located in remote areas. These units are unlikely to generate interest of&#13;
contractors beyond the immediate vicinity. The model would be selected when the community is willing and&#13;
able to contribute the required 20 percent of labor. It is expected that about 20 percent of new construction&#13;
and 30 percent of rehabilitation works would be carried out under this modality.&#13;
Designs and Prototypes.  A basic design for each type of facility would be selected by the&#13;
jurisdiction, in consultation with the community or municipal health committees, from the SSA menu of&#13;
prototypes, with applicable variations to accommodate local and jurisdictional diversity in climate, ecology,&#13;
and available materials in the immediate community. In addition, technical supervision would be provided by&#13;
the civil works department of the SCS in the states, with guidance from a self-help handbook. Consultants&#13;
would be hired to design the handbook and would include the options available, according to the type of&#13;
works to be done pointing out local or jurisdictional conditions in each state.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
Approximately 510 small works would be contracted each year under the community-based model. Local&#13;
health jurisdictions and municipalities would carry out works contracting directly with small local contractors.&#13;
Contracts under this modality would be awarded when: (a) implementation of works would not attract large&#13;
contractors because of their small size, inaccessible locations, and wide scattering throughout each state's rural&#13;
areas; (b) poor rural communities or municipalities are able to directly manage investments and to make the&#13;
required 20 percent contribution to the works through the donation of unskilled labor and local materials; (c)&#13;
selection of works to be limited to those works for which the community, where the medical facility is located, is&#13;
willing to both contribute to and physically supervise; (d) jurisdictions, municipalities or local community have met&#13;
the eligibility criteria to participate or have maintained an active role in meeting the development objectives of the&#13;
component and, through this process, strengthened their ability to deliver the basic care package. This modality&#13;
would not require national competitive bidding procedures and its implementation would be done through&#13;
health committees, under the oversight of municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
109                                   ANNEX 12&#13;
CIVIL WORKS&#13;
Under the community-based model, the project would finance the procurement of small works for&#13;
primary care medical facilities, estimated to cost less than US$60,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$12.2&#13;
million. Jurisdictions and municipalities would contract works directly with local health committees or with small&#13;
local contractors. The project would finance technical assistance to enable the jurisdictions to prepare technical&#13;
proposals and budgets and to supervise implementation under this model . In those cases where the health&#13;
jurisdictions lack the capacity to contract works or materials, the state health authority would carry out procurement&#13;
on their behalf. Small works of rehabilitation of existing infrastructure would be contracted directly with&#13;
local contractors for all or parts of the work, using regionalized reference prices, revised annually, and the&#13;
community would contribute unskilled labor and local materials. The Operational Manual would detail the flow&#13;
of actions and control mechanisms to supervise works under this model.&#13;
Funding&#13;
Once a work has been approved through a subproject, the jurisdiction would be given an advance payment&#13;
by the SPCU in order to begin implementation. Proof of successful implementation of the work, and justification&#13;
for reimbursement through the Special Account, however, would be provided by the acta de entrega y recepci6n,&#13;
where the completion of the work, and the total budget expended, is certified by the state health authorities.&#13;
State-Managed Model&#13;
The state-managed model would be chosen when size or conditions under the community-based&#13;
model warrant the transfer of the procurement arrangements to the SPCUs. These entities would procure,&#13;
administer and supervise the remaining of the works program not contracted under the community-based&#13;
model. Normally, medical facilities to be managed under this model are expected to be located in urban and&#13;
in rural areas, with easy access. (Contracts equal to or more than US$350,000, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$23.7 million under NCB; lumpsum fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of three quotations would&#13;
be used for contracts estimated to cost less than US$350,000, up to and aggregate amount of US$9.1 million.&#13;
If feasible, contracts would be packaged to cost not less than US$60,000).&#13;
Supervision&#13;
To ensure the quality of the civil works constructed and/ or rehabilitated under the project, regardless&#13;
of their size, the PCU would hire consultants from the private sector to spot check the civil works program.&#13;
Summary terms of reference for these consultants are included in this annex. Jurisdictions would be legally&#13;
responsible for the works to the state and federal governments.&#13;
Infrastructure Maintenance&#13;
The project would support an innovative maintenance program. Municipalities would receive each&#13;
year a fixed amount based on the number and type of facilities in the municipality (an average of US$320 per&#13;
facility) for infrastructure and furniture maintenance. The municipalities (ayuntamientos), in coordination&#13;
with the health committees, would ensure that maintenance is carried out either by obtaining the services of a&#13;
local contractor or by purchasing materials and organizing maintenance programs with the help of the&#13;
community. Since there is no previous local experience with systematic maintenance programs, during the&#13;
first two years, the project would phase in implementation of the maintenance program in selected areas in&#13;
the First Basic Health Care Project states in order to test mechanisms for transfer of maintenance funds to the&#13;
municipalities and to monitor their performance. Based on the results of this pilot maintenance modality, the&#13;
program would be expanded to the rest of the project areas. The project would also finance the design and&#13;
printing of the construction and maintenance handbook, and technical assistance from qualified consultants to&#13;
prepare the handbooks, which would be widely disseminated in the project areas.&#13;
&#13;

CIVI:L WORKS&#13;
Prioritization of Works&#13;
Prioritization of construction and/or rehabilitation works would be made by the SPCU's the states, in&#13;
consultation with the State Advisory Committee and the COPLADEs, according to criteria defined in the&#13;
Operating Manual (Annex 9). The Operational Manual would further ensure that: (a) the improved&#13;
prototype designs would include technical drawings, budgets and technical specifications; (b) evidence of&#13;
rightful ownership of land by the health jurisdictions or municipal governments, through donation or&#13;
purchase; (c) in the case of the civil works carried out through the community model, financial resources&#13;
would have been transferred to the respective municipal government (ayuntamientos). All investments in&#13;
medical facilities would be subject compliance with these conditions before approval.&#13;
Supervision of physical infrastructure&#13;
Summary of Terms of Reference&#13;
Background. Substantial gains were achieved in the quality and in the implementation of the&#13;
physical infrastructure program for hospital rehabilitation in the First Basic Health Care Project, through the&#13;
supervision services provided by a specialized private sector firm. The technical assistance provided by the&#13;
firm proved to be an asset in the decision making process during implementation, since qualified and timely&#13;
information received by the PCU and SPCUs ensured that remedial actions were put in place, supporting the&#13;
activities of local supervision teams and contractors, while maintaining managerial levels fully involved in the&#13;
advance of the activities. By contrast, other physical infrastructure programs for medical units throughout&#13;
the proiect states where by the PCU and SPCU supervision was limited, lagged substantially. To unify the&#13;
supervision plans under the Second Basic Health Care Project, it has been agreed that the PCU would&#13;
engage the services of qualified private sector firms to carry out the overall physical infrastructure program.&#13;
This program would include the construction/rehabilitation of health centers (unidades de asistencia para la&#13;
salud), rural health centers (centros de salud dispersos) and delivery inns (posadas de nacimiento), and state&#13;
laboratories.&#13;
Objectives. The main objective of the overall supervision services in physical infrastructure is to&#13;
provide qualified technical assistance in the overall supervision of the physical infrastructure program under&#13;
the project, to assist executing agencies in the achievement of the overall objectives of the Basic Health&#13;
Package.&#13;
Main Tasks. The consultant will be responsible for: (a) designing the supervision methodology for&#13;
the component, reflected in an Infrastructure Supervision Action Plan (ISAP) to be adopted for the project&#13;
(strategy, procedures, formats, organization and information mechanisms); (b) implementing the ISAP in the&#13;
participating states according to the annual program of approved subprojects; (c) providing technical&#13;
assistance to local health authorities and community teams in the preparation of works subprojects; (d)&#13;
providing qualified periodic random review the technical specs (expedientes tecnicos) and contracting&#13;
mechanisms proposed for the subprojects; (e) overseeing the implementation of the upkeep and maintenance&#13;
program, (f) providing periodic reports to the managerial and technical levels in the PCU and in the SPCUs&#13;
evaluating the appropriateness of the procedures used to implement projects, and the quality of the&#13;
infrastructure program in each state, according to the criteria established under the community-based and&#13;
state-managed models; and (g) contributing with specific recommendations: (i) to maintain the level of effort&#13;
of all parties involved in the ISAP, (ii) to modify or rectify actions, based on supervision reports, (iii)&#13;
transfer technology to supervision teams in participating states.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
11l                                    ANNEX 12&#13;
CIVIL WORKS&#13;
Specific Activities. For the implementation of the ISAP, the consultant would organize its activities&#13;
to carry out overall supervision both at the central and state levels. The consultant would assign a team of&#13;
specialists to carry out specific activities related to: (a) the technical review of subprojects and specs, (b) to&#13;
select the works to be supervised in accordance with agreed procedures in the ISAP, to review on site the&#13;
advance of specific works chosen for supervision, (c) to verify randomly compliance of contractors against&#13;
the obligations in their contracts, (d) to evaluate the quality and quantity of supervision provided by the state&#13;
health authorities and local groups under the community-based and state-managed models, (e) to verify the&#13;
quality of the works performed and clear the certificates of acceptance delivery reports (actas de recepcion),&#13;
and (f) to prepare periodic reports and recommendations to be submitted to decision-making bodies agreed in&#13;
the ISAP.&#13;
Products. The services provided by the consultant would include:&#13;
(a)    An Infrastructure Supervision Action Plan (ISAP), including the supervision handbook, at&#13;
central, state and community level for both construction/rehabilitation modalities selected for the project and&#13;
proforma reports for periodic supervision and for specific recommendations/actions;&#13;
(b)    Periodic reports, as agreed for the ISAP for each participating state;&#13;
(c)    Annual Report to support the annual review  of the project;&#13;
(d)    Final Completion Report for each individual state physical infrastructure program and for the&#13;
project as a whole.&#13;

INFORMATION SUPPORT SYSTEMS&#13;
ESTUDIO DE FACTIBILIDAD DEL SUBCOMPONENTE "INFORMATICA"&#13;
Terminos De Referencia -&#13;
Antecedentes y Objetivos&#13;
1.    A traves de la Secretarfa de Salud (SSA), el Gobierno de Mexico esta negociando con el Banco&#13;
Mundial un prestamo para consolidar los resultados que estan siendo obtenidos en el Programa de Apoyo a&#13;
los Servicios de Salud para la Poblaci6n Abierta (PASSPA I) corrientemente en ejecuci6n.  El nuevo&#13;
proyecto, denominado PASSPA II, tiene como principales objetivos: (a) soportar el acceso de la poblaci6n&#13;
no asegurada a los servicios de salud; (b) promover el eficiente uso de los recursos utilizados por los&#13;
servicios de salud, y (c) proveer servicios de salud de alta calidad. PASSPA II sera implementado en nueve&#13;
estados (Chiapas, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz, Yucatan y Zacatecas),&#13;
afectando a una poblaci6n de aproximadamente 15 millones de personas.&#13;
2.     En parte, el proyecto PASSPA II estara orientado a desarrollar varias actividades en el campo de la&#13;
informatica, tal como se describe en detalle mas adelante. El prop6sito de este Estudio de Factibilidad, cuyo&#13;
costo sera cubierto con fondos provenientes de un donativo otorgado por el Gobierno de Jap6n, es determinar&#13;
la inversi6n requerida para informatica y el posible cronograma de trabajo.&#13;
3.    Desde un punto de vista funcional, PASSPA 1. afectara cuatro niveles bien diferentes: (a) la SSA a&#13;
nivel nacional; (b) los organismos del Sector Salud a nivel de cada Estado; (c) los hospitales de cada Estado,&#13;
y (d) las jurisdicciones sanitarias (cada Estado tiene de 5 a 10 jurisdicciones sanitarias, cada una de las cuales&#13;
supervisa centros asistenciales que proveen servicios basicos de salud a la poblaci6n).&#13;
4.     Situaci6n actual: Durante los ultimos afnos, la SSA ha hecho considerables avances en los campos de&#13;
recolecci6n y procesamiento de datos, especialmente en lo referente a epidemiologia. Sin embargo, dicha&#13;
informaci6n no esta siendo bien aprovechada debido a la inexistencia de sistemas que apoyen la toma de&#13;
decisiones. En los distintos niveles organizativos, es sensible la falta de equipamiento adecuado, software, y&#13;
personal especializado que han limitado la utilizaci6n de informatica.&#13;
5.     Evoluci6n futura: La politica de decentralizaci6n iniciada con PASSPA I va a ser reforzada con&#13;
PASSPA II mediante la implementaci6n de sistemas de informaci6n que permitan la toma de decisiones a&#13;
nivel local y estatal. Especificamente, se desea:  (a) mejorar la calidad general de la provisi6n de los&#13;
servicios basicos de salud; (b) mediante el uso de herramientas informaticas, identificar y responder&#13;
rapidamente a problemas epidemiol6gicos y de salud pdblica; (c) mejorar la operaci6n y calidad de las&#13;
acciones de regulaci6n sanitaria; (d) mejorar la planeaci6n y la ejecuci6n presupuestal a traves de un manejo&#13;
financiero mas eficiente, y (e) optimizar el uso de drogas y medicamentos, materiales y equipos a traves del&#13;
mejoramiento de los metodos de compra, manejo de inventarios, distribuci6n y mantenimiento preventivo.&#13;
6.     A tal efecto, se prevee la implementaci6n de los siguientes sistemas:&#13;
(a) TECNICOS&#13;
Atenci6n Medica: En base a informaci6n sobre cantidad de pacientes atendidos, duraci6n de las&#13;
internaciones, medicamentos utilizados, etc., el sistema establecera la calidad de la atenci6n medica,&#13;
niveles de productividad, costos unitarios por intervenci6n, etc.&#13;
Control Epidemiol6gico:  Este sistema mejorara la capacidad de recoger, procesar, analizar e&#13;
interpretar datos epidemiol6gicos y bioestadisticos tales como morbilidad, mortalidad, etc.,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
113                                    ANNEX 13&#13;
INFORMATION SUPPORT SYSTEMS&#13;
fundamentalmente haciendo uso de sistemas de informaci6n geograficos (Geographic Information&#13;
Systems - GIS). La Direcci6n General de Epidemiologia de la SSA supervisara el desarrollo y la&#13;
implementaci6n del sistema a nivel estatal.&#13;
Gesti6n Hospitalaria:  El prop6sito de este sistema es mejorar la informacion disponible sobre&#13;
productividad, calidad de la atenci6n y administraci6n hospitalaria, incluyendo contabilidad de costos&#13;
y manejo financiero.&#13;
Regulaci6n Sanitaria: Este sistema facilitara el manejo de informaci6n y la toma de decisiones&#13;
respecto a las regulaciones y control de calidad en la producci6n de bienes y la provisi6n de&#13;
servicios. El objetivo es que los estados tengan la capacidad de controlar e implementar en forma&#13;
efectiva medidas de regulaci6n sanitaria, facilitando asi el trabajo de los verificadores sanitarios y de&#13;
los laboratorios de salud publica.&#13;
(b) ADMINISTRATIVOS&#13;
Control Financiero: Aprovechando la experiencia ganada por la SSA, se desea dar a los estados&#13;
participantes en PASSPA II la capacidad para recolectar, analizar e interpretar datos sobre manejo y&#13;
asignaci6n de recursos, presupuesto, mecanismos de financiaci6n, contabilidad y control de fondos y&#13;
uso de la infraestructura para facilitar la toma de decisiones a nivel estatal, jurisdiccional y&#13;
municipal. Estos sistemas, que utilizaran redes de transmisi6n de datos, estaran interconectados a&#13;
nivel nacional.&#13;
Abasto: En una primera fase, los sistemas de compra y control de stock desarrollados bajo PASSPA&#13;
I seran utilizados por los estados participantes en PASSPA II. Entre otros, se adoptara el sistema de&#13;
suministros de productos farmac6uticos implementado en el Distrito Federal. Un sistema standard&#13;
para licitaciones, y compras directas se desarrollara en una segunda etapa. Por uiltimo, la tercera&#13;
etapa expandira el sistema para que las adquisiciones a nivel estatal, corrientemente bajo&#13;
responsabilidad de la SSA, sea procesada en los estados con consolidaci6n a nivel nacional.&#13;
Conservaci6n v Mantenimiento: Con base en la experiencia de la SSA adquirida a traves de la&#13;
implantaci6n del Programa de Conservaci6n y Mantenimiento y la operaci6n de ese subcomponente&#13;
en el PASSPA 1, se desea implantar un sistenia permanente de conservacion y mantenimiento, de&#13;
caracter tanto preventivo como correctivo, cubriendo infraestructura fisica, equipo y vehiculos, con&#13;
miras a optimizar la utilizaci6n de dichos recursos.&#13;
7.     Resultados Esperados: El presente Estudio de Factibilidad debe determinar, para cada uno de los&#13;
niveles mencionados en el parrafo 3.:&#13;

PROJECT ADMINISTRATION&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION, MONITORING AND IMPACT EVALUATION&#13;
A.    Advisory Committee&#13;
1.    The Advisory Committee will be an advisory body to the SSA and the Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU), to facilitate and ensure an effective execution of the project. Its functions will include: (a) approval&#13;
of the annual work plans and budgets; (b) supervision of project implementation as agreed with the Bank;&#13;
(c) adjudication on agreements within the project's overall framework, and unify norms and criteria among&#13;
executing agencies; (d) information to authorities on progress in project implementation; and (e) provision&#13;
of technical assistance to the PCU and the SPCUs on specific aspects of the project ( i.e. budget, flow of&#13;
funds, impact evaluation).&#13;
2.    The Advisory Committee will be chaired by the Undersecretary of Health and will be composed of&#13;
representatives of the SSA. The Oficialia Mayor, NAFIN, SHCP and other members indicated by the SSA&#13;
would be invited to participate at the annual plenary meetings.&#13;
B.    Project Coordination Unit (PCU)&#13;
3.    The PCU will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the project. The organization of&#13;
the PCU draws from the experience accumulated by the PCU of the First Basic Health Care Project,&#13;
particularly highliting the need for: (a) a lean organizational structure that promotes empowerment and&#13;
initiative at the state and jurisdictional levels; (b) strong emphasis on analytical and qualitative measures as&#13;
opposed to the meeting of rigid preset targets; (c) a greater integration of the SPCUs within the health&#13;
services given the future decentralization and autonomy of the Health Services in the States; (d) an improved&#13;
information system which would provide the basis for improving the management capacity in the states; (e)&#13;
institutional strengthening, particularly of planning, budgeting and financial functions.&#13;
4.    The proposed organizational structure rests on two principles: (a) small, dynamic units composed of&#13;
experienced and high-quality staff; and (b) transfer of technical, administrative and management functions&#13;
from the center to the states and to the jurisdictions, which would facilitate the implementation of priority&#13;
programs and take timely management actions.&#13;
5.    In line with the project objectives, the PCU main responsibilities would be to: (a) implement and&#13;
manage project resources, monitor expenditures and provide assistance to the Health Services in the states, in&#13;
planning, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of project impact; (b) analyze and consolidate the annual&#13;
work plans and budgets; (c) plan and conduct the annual and mid-term reviews and preparation of periodic&#13;
reports; (d) liaise with the Advisory Committee, the offices within the SSA directly involved in project&#13;
implementation, the Health Services in the states, NAFIN, SHCP and the Bank; (e) manage contracts for&#13;
technical assistance, studies; management training for the central level; and for the improved management&#13;
information system; (f) monitor the implementation of the project and follow up on actions taken by the&#13;
executing agencies; (g) consolidate periodic progress reports for each component and the project as a whole&#13;
in collaboration with the Advisory Committee and executing agencies; and (h) prepare the Project Completion&#13;
Report (PCR).&#13;
6.    Staff Composition.   The PCU will be headed by a Director General (temporary, fixed term&#13;
position) appointed by the SSA, who will report directly to the Undersecretary of Health, and will be&#13;
responsible for: (a) coordination and supervision of project implementation; (b) liaison between the Advisory&#13;
Committee and other federal and state institutions for coordination of project activities; and (c) regular&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

communication with NAFIN and the Bank, including the periodic preparation of progress reports and the&#13;
organization of annual and mid-term reviews. To strengthen the staffing of the PCU, in order to meet the&#13;
demands of the project, the existing technical positions would be reviewed and if needed, new ones would be&#13;
created. The technical positions for senior staff of the PCU would be filled by experienced professionals in&#13;
the areas of planning and supervision, human resources development, and administration, financing and&#13;
procurement. Wherever possible, key officials involved and trained in the implementation of the First Basic&#13;
Health Care Project and in the preparation of this project would be retained to provide assistance to the&#13;
implementation of the Second Health Care Project, particularly in the new states.&#13;
7.    The Director General will oversee three units, each headed by a separate Director: (i) a unit for the&#13;
implementation of the first component; (ii) a unit for implementation of the third component; and (iii) an&#13;
administration, financing and procurement unit. The second component will be managed by the SSAs&#13;
General Directorate of Evaluation, but will be organizationally integrated into the PCU (See Organigram).&#13;
The terms of reference for the senior PCU staff include::&#13;
a)     Planning and Supervision.&#13;

components; consolidating periodic progress reports for each component and the&#13;
project as a whole, through the use of an information system to be developed by the&#13;
project and agreed with the Bank;&#13;
v)     Monitor the delivery and quality of products or studies, by consultants or consulting&#13;
firms, in accordance with their terms of reference.&#13;

PROJECT ADMINISTRATION&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
vi)    Preparation of a roster of consultants, consulting firms, universities and other&#13;
institutions specialized in health sector reforms, policies, administration to be used&#13;
during the project implementation;&#13;
vii)    Design the incentive program for staff located in remote areas;&#13;
viii)   Oversee and coordinate jointly with the states the development of training and&#13;
educational materials.&#13;
c)     Administration, Financing and Procurement.&#13;
i)     Coordination administration, accounting, and planning of project activities. Maintain&#13;
and ensure that the states maintain adequate records for Bank review (prior and ex-&#13;
post reviews);&#13;
ii)    Ensure the availability of counterpart funds through NAFIN, including providing in a&#13;
timely manner all the information requested by NAFIN, SHCP, for the preparation of&#13;
the annual budget, processing of disbursement applications and replenishment of&#13;
Special Account, according to procedures agreed with the Bank;&#13;

facilitate the annual budgeting process and secure the counterpart funds on a timely&#13;
manner;&#13;
iv)    Implement a financial management system, including accounting  and control,&#13;
disbursement, and auditing system.&#13;
8.     The PCU will also assist the project states in the preparation of annual procurement plans; training&#13;
on procurement (preparation of the standard bidding documents, and invitation packages, criteria for&#13;
evaluation of bids, technical specifications), and other information needed for the procurement of civil works,&#13;
goods and services, and the hiring of consultants. It will also jointly with NAFIN, assist the states in&#13;
resolving procurement and disbursement bottlenecks.&#13;
State PCUs (SPCUs) and Decentralization Support Units (DSUs)&#13;
9.     The responsibility for the implementation of project activities at the state and jurisdictional levels&#13;
lies with the State Health Authority (Jefe de Servicios Coordinados), in each state. To strengthen the&#13;
coordination and oversight of the project, a small SPCU would continue to exist (in the case of the First&#13;
Basic Health Care Project states) or be created in the new Second Basic Health Care Project states. The&#13;
SPCUs would function within the state health services, and would be responsible for: (a) coordination and&#13;
supervision of the implementation of all project components; (b) monitor project implementation at the state&#13;
and jurisdictional level; (c) liaise with the state advisory committee and other agencies for project&#13;
implementation; and (d) preparation of periodic progress reports as requested by the PCU. In order to&#13;
strengthen the implementation capacity of the SPCUs, the project would finance high-quality and experienced&#13;
consultants or would as far as possible, use the existing staff trained under the First Basic Health Care&#13;
Project, in the areas of planning, supervision, administration, financing and procurement.&#13;
10.    Staff Composition. The PCU will be headed by a Director (Director de airea) appointed by the&#13;
SSA. The Director (a temporary fixed term staff) will respond administratively to the SHAs and technically&#13;
to the Director General of the federal PCU (see organigram). The Director will oversee the two Assistant&#13;
Directors (also temporary fixed term staff - Subdirectores) responsible for (i) an implementation and&#13;
supervision unit; and (ii) and administration, financing and procurement unit. Their TORs would include&#13;
inter alia:&#13;
&#13;

following responsibilities:&#13;
i)    Assistance to the states in the implementation of all the components in the project;&#13;
ii)    Assistance to the states and jurisdictions in the timely preparation of the annual work&#13;
plans and budgets;&#13;
iii)    Review jointly with the State Health Authorities of the annual work plans and&#13;
budgets prepared by the executing agencies and prepare recommendations to be&#13;
considered by the state advisory committee, to be submitted to the federal PCU for&#13;
technical review.&#13;

auditing system, to facilitate the processing of disbursements.&#13;
11.   For the implementation of the Institutional Development and Decentralization Component (II)&#13;
Decentralization Support Units (DSUs) would be created in participating states or on a regional basis, staffed&#13;
with two consultants and the necessary support personnel (see organigram) to assist the State Health Director&#13;
in the implementation, operation and evaluation of the second component and all aspects related to the&#13;
decentralization process. The DSU consultants would report to the State Health Director, but would be&#13;
financed through the project. They would closely liaise both with the federal and state PCUs. The SSA's&#13;
General Directorate for Evaluation has the overall responsibility and oversight for the second component of&#13;
the project and the DSU network.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Second Basic
            Health Care Project are: 1) to support equitable access to a
            cost-effective package of quality health services for the
            uninsured and underserved; 2) support institutional
            development through the modernization and decentralization
            of technical, managerial, and financing processes in the
            states; and 3) support the modernization and restructuring
            of the Federal Secretariat of Health (SSA) to assume an
            active leadership role in the sector. This will be achieved
            through three components: 1) basic health care component
            which supports a basic health care package, with
            interventions selected from a predefined menu and targeted
            to the most disadvanted areas; 2) institutional development
            and decentralization component which improved the management
            and decision-making capacity in the states and
            jurisdictions; and 3) modernization and restructuring of the SSA.
