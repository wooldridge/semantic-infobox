         In fiscal year 2009, the total amount of guarantees issued for projects in MIGA's developing&#13;
         member countries reached $1.4 billion, representing a decline from 2008 when the agency issued&#13;
         a record amount of new gross exposure. The decline in new business resulted from the reduced&#13;
         investment flows stemming from the global economic crisis. At the same time, the particularly&#13;
         low cancellation of existing business underscored the importance clients placed on MIGA's&#13;
         coverage, especially in these difficult times. As a result of low run-off, MIGA's outstanding&#13;
         portfolio grew by a significant $800 million last year to $7.3 billion.&#13;

         this year, MIGA's operating income was $50.6 million, compared with $55.0 million in fiscal year 2008. the decrease of&#13;
         $4.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in investment income. Fiscal year 2009 net income decreased by $34.5 million&#13;
         compared to fiscal year 2008, primarily due to currency translation losses. (see Management's Discussion and Analysis&#13;

This has been a year of testing for the World Bank&#13;
Group and our ability to respond to the needs of our&#13;
clients. Financial crisis has spiraled into an economic&#13;
and unemployment crisis, which could become a&#13;
social and human crisis with political implications.&#13;

MIGA's 2009 Annual Report reflects how the agency is&#13;

Challenging Times&#13;
&#13;
This has been an extremely difficult year characterized by&#13;
challenges and uncertainty throughout the world. Looking&#13;
back, it was less than a year ago that the financial crisis&#13;
emerged and quickly transcended national borders to&#13;
include most, if not all, of the developed world. The opti-&#13;
mistic predictions that emerging and developing countries&#13;
might escape the tsunami proved false and the situation&#13;
soon turned into a global economic crisis.&#13;

The Latin America and Caribbean region has registered strong economic growth in&#13;
recent years--but the global financial crisis has exacted a heavy cost. Even before the&#13;
crisis, infrastructure spending by countries in the region had fallen sharply. In Costa&#13;

average of $75 million annually in road maintenance alone.&#13;

Following a record year in fiscal year 2008, new issuance of guarantees fell from $2.1 billion to $1.4&#13;
billion in 2009. The limited availability of credit had a significant impact on our portfolio as many&#13;
proposed investments requiring large amounts of debt financing were delayed. However, as a result of&#13;
a sizeable amount of new guarantees issued and a low amount of portfolio run-off, MIGA's outstanding&#13;
gross portfolio grew by $800 million last year, closing at $7.3 billion, a record high. In addition, MIGA's&#13;
support for South-South and small equity-driven investments grew in fiscal year 2009. MIGA also played&#13;
a significant role in the financial sector by providing coverage to support continued bank lending in&#13;
Europe and Central Asia--a region that has been hit particularly hard by the financial crisis.&#13;

China        Project Name: chongqing Water Project&#13;
             Guarantee Holder: suez environnement sAs&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA has issued two guarantees totaling $72.2 million for suez environnement sAs ("se"), a French company,&#13;
             covering its investments in Chongqing Water Group Co., ltd ("CWG") and Chongqing sino-French tangjiatuo&#13;
             Wastewater treatment Co., ltd ("tangjiatuo Wastewater Co.") for the Chongqing Water project in China. the&#13;
             coverage is for a period of up to 15 years against the risks of transfer restriction and expropriation.&#13;
&#13;
             the project involves the acquisition of a minority stake in CWG by se, the expansion of the existing Chongqing&#13;
             tangjiatuo Wastewater treatment plant, and the installation of sludge dryers. Its major development impacts are&#13;
             to attract FDI to this under-developed region and sector and to restructure and improve the water and wastewater&#13;
             sector in Chongqing municipality by introducing se as a strategic investor. the project will also increase the&#13;
             municipality's wastewater treatment capacity, help address the issue of sludge treatment, and contribute to the&#13;
             improvement of water quality in the yangtze River. under the expansion, the capacity of the tangjiatuo wastewater&#13;
             treatment plant will be increased from 300,000 m3/d to 400,000 m3/d and sludge dryers will be installed to allow&#13;
             transportation and treatment of the sludge.&#13;
&#13;
             China's western provinces have experienced rapid growth, but they continue to lag behind in attracting foreign&#13;
             direct investment. Chongqing municipality, in southwest China, has a population of about 32 million. the fast&#13;
             urbanization and industrial growth in the region have resulted in serious wastewater issues. It is estimated that the&#13;
             municipality generates nearly one billion tons of wastewater a year. Most of the untreated wastewater is discharged&#13;
             directly into the yangtze and Jialing rivers, threatening the quality of water supply. the wastewater treatment rep-&#13;
             resents a major environmental challenge for Chongqing, one of the largest cities in China, situated upstream of the&#13;
             three Gorges dam on the yangtze River.&#13;
&#13;
             the Chongqing municipal government has actively encouraged participation and involvement of foreign companies&#13;
             in the water sector to address these challenges. se and a Hong Kong co-investor nWs Holdings limited will&#13;
             together bring in e154 million of investment. the involvement of foreign companies will also facilitate the intro-&#13;
             duction of advanced water and wastewater treatment technologies and management, including improvement of&#13;
             project management and corporate governance. this project is fully consistent with the World Bank Group's China&#13;
             Country partnership strategy (2006-2010) and the Chinese government's western development strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             the project is also aligned with MIGA's strategy of promoting investment in infrastructure projects.&#13;

China        Project Name: second darco Water (Qianyuan Water) Project&#13;
             Guarantee Holder: Darco environmental pte., ltd.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA has issued additional coverage in the amount of $3.12 million for the second Darco Water (Qianyuan Water)&#13;
             project in China. the additional coverage is for Darco environmental pte., ltd. (Darco) of singapore's equity&#13;
             investment in the project and covers the risk of expropriation.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA's Board approved the issuance of guarantees to the project up to $19.5 million in May 2007. the investor&#13;
             signed a contract in the amount of $7.56 million in fiscal year 2007. the additional coverage of $3.12 million is sup-&#13;
             porting the project's financial restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
             the project consists of the construction of a water treatment plant, on a build-operate-transfer (Bot) basis, that&#13;
             will supply 100,000 cubic meters per day of potable water to residents and industries in Deqing County. Raw water&#13;
             will be sourced from the Dui Hekou reservoir and piped to a water treatment facility 20 kilometers away.&#13;
&#13;
             Deqing is one of the fastest developing counties in Zhejiang province with an estimated population of 430,000.&#13;
             Due to its rapid growth, the county has been facing a serious shortage of potable water as well as degradation in&#13;
             water quality. the project will address the water supply shortage and is expected to contribute to local economic&#13;
             development, urbanization, and public health.&#13;
&#13;
             Managing resource scarcity and environmental challenge is one of the five themes of the World Bank Group's&#13;
             Country partnership strategy for China. Construction of water supply and wastewater treatment plants is a key&#13;
             element of this theme.&#13;

                        equity investment in Kashf Microfinance Bank (KMB) in pakistan. the coverage is for a period of up to ten years&#13;
                        against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
                        the project involves the establishment of the Kashf Microfinance Bank in conjunction with the Kashf Foundation, a&#13;
                        foundation which uses group lending to provide finance to the country's poorest people. Kashf will transfer its indi-&#13;
                        vidual lending portfolio (i.e., the upper end of microfinance in the local context) to KMB, as a base portfolio to the&#13;
                        new bank. KMB aims to reach significant scale quickly by offering savings and deposit products, individual loans,&#13;
                        and other value-added services to micro and small business owners, especially women.&#13;
&#13;
                        KMB intends to operate across pakistan starting with branches in punjab and sindh, but expanding into&#13;
                        Balochistan, northwest Frontier province, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Within five years, KMB expects to&#13;
                        establish 100 branches and to have a loan portfolio of above $270 million equivalent to approximately 375,000 bor-&#13;
                        rowers and over one million small depositors.&#13;

                        MIGA has issued guarantees of $47.72 million to Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich A.G.(RZB) in Austria covering&#13;
                        its e35 million shareholder loans to its subsidiary Raiffeisen leasing d.o.o.sarajevo (RlBH) in Bosnia and&#13;
                        Herzegovina. the loans will fund RlBH's leasing portfolio. MIGA's coverage is for a period of up to six years&#13;
                        against the risks of transfer restriction and expropriation of funds.&#13;
&#13;
                        RlBH leases vehicles, including cars, trucks and trailers, various types of equipment, including processing,&#13;
                        packaging and construction equipment, as well as leasing of industrial and office buildings. loan proceeds are&#13;
                        expected to be used to finance vehicle leases to micro and small-size enterprises and car leases to individuals.&#13;
&#13;
                        this project is expected to contribute to the development of the financial sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina by&#13;
                        improving access to finance, particularly to segments of the economy that are currently underserved.&#13;
&#13;
                        the shareholder loans support RlBH's ongoing leasing business, thereby contributing toward the continued&#13;
                        development and strengthening of the country's leasing sector. the leasing sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina is&#13;
                        still relatively small compared to West european countries. small and medium-size enterprises (sMes) are espe-&#13;
                        cially expected to benefit from the development of leasing in the country, as they often do not qualify for bank&#13;
                        financing and lack the capital to purchase fixed assets to grow their businesses. sMes and corporates account for&#13;
                        more than 90 percent of RlBH's leasing volume.&#13;
&#13;
                        MIGA's support for this investment is aligned with the World Bank Group's country assistance strategy in Bosnia&#13;
                        and Herzegovina for 2008-2011 and the country's development objectives, particularly with regard to improving&#13;

&#13;
                        uBA's shareholder loan will provide BACH with long-term liquidity, help restructure BACH's operations by&#13;
                        improving the bank's asset-liability management, and improve its structural liquidity. the loan is part of a broader&#13;
                        funding strategy of the uniCredit Group to finance its subsidiaries and is particularly important in view of the&#13;
                        current turmoil in financial markets worldwide, including Hungary.&#13;
&#13;
                        MIGA supports this project in conjunction with the Financial sector Initiative framework recently presented&#13;
                        to MIGA's Board of Directors as part of a coordinated international response to the ongoing global financial&#13;
                        crisis. Hungary, like many other countries in the europe and Central Asia region, is currently facing difficult&#13;
                        fiscal adjustments along with the need for external financing. MIGA's support to the project will supplement the&#13;

             Guarantee Holder: uniCredit Bank Austria AG&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA has issued a guarantee of up to $190.0 million covering uniCredit Bank Austria AG's (uBA) $200 million&#13;
             shareholder loan to its subsidiary, AtF Bank Kazakhstan. the coverage is for a period of five years against the risks&#13;
             of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
             the loan will improve AtF Bank's asset-liability management through better matching of maturities in light of the&#13;
             shortage of long-term financing available in the Kazakh market. the loan is part of a broader funding strategy of&#13;
             the uniCredit Group to finance its subsidiaries and is particularly important given the current turmoil in financial&#13;
             markets worldwide, including Kazakhstan.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA's support for this project is in conjunction with the Financial sector Initiative (FsI) framework recently&#13;
             developed by MIGA as part of a coordinated international response to the ongoing global financial crisis. MIGA's&#13;
             support will play a critical role in facilitating adequate long-term cross-border flows from uBA into its subsidiary in&#13;
             Kazakhstan by providing liquidity, and will help, in part, Kazakhstan's financial sector to stabilize. this shareholder&#13;
             loan will provide refinancing of existing liabilities in the Kazakh economy. the ultimate beneficiaries of this loan will&#13;

                       shareholder loan to I.C.s. Raiffeisen leasing sRl in the Republic of Moldova (RlMD). the loan will support the&#13;

                       particularly to segments of the economy that are currently underserved. the financial sector in Moldova is also&#13;
                       expected to benefit from the presence of experienced foreign banking institutions like RZB Group, in terms of&#13;
                       strengthening standards by establishing best practices, developing new products, and fostering competition among&#13;

                       the World Bank Group's country assistance strategy for Moldova, covering fiscal years 2009-2012, places emphasis&#13;
                       on the need to enhance competitiveness of the national economy, promote private investment and the expansion&#13;

                       million. the coverage is for a period up to 10 years against the risks of transfer restriction and expropriation.&#13;
&#13;
                       KBC's shareholder loan investment is helping Absolut Bank enhance and strengthen its liquidity, taking into con-&#13;
                       sideration the liquidity constraints in both the Russian and global financial markets. It will also help Absolut Bank&#13;
                       continue its activity throughout Russia.&#13;
&#13;
                       MIGA's support to onDD is in accordance with MIGA's mandate to cooperate with national entities of its member&#13;
                       countries as stated in MIGA's Convention. this will be the first time MIGA has provided reinsurance support to&#13;
                       onDD. MIGA's reinsurance will free up onDD's capacity to facilitate further investments into Russia.&#13;
&#13;
                       one of the main objectives of the World Bank Group's country partnership strategy for the Russian Federation is&#13;
                       to support the development of the country's financial sector. the proposed project is consistent with this objective,&#13;
                       as the project will support private investment in various sectors through the availability of credit at a time when&#13;
                       it is becoming more constrained in the country and worldwide. In addition, given Absolut Bank's strategic goal to&#13;
                       continue to support its banking network operations regionally, the project will help promote private investment at&#13;
                       the regional level outside of the two main urban areas of the country, an objective which is also consistent with the&#13;
                       country partnership strategy.&#13;

             MIGA has issued a guarantee of up to e95 million covering uniCredit Bank Austria AG's (uBA) e100 million share-&#13;
             holder loan to its subsidiary, uniCredit Bank serbia JsC (uBsR). the coverage is for a period of up to five years&#13;
             against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
             the loan will provide uBsR with long-term liquidity and improve uBsR's asset-liability management by matching&#13;
             assets and funding of similar maturities. the loan is part of a broader funding strategy of the uniCredit Group to&#13;
             finance its subsidiaries and is particularly important in view of the current turmoil in financial markets worldwide,&#13;
             including serbia.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA supports this project in conjunction with the Financial sector Initiative framework recently presented&#13;
             to MIGA's Board of Directors as part of a coordinated international response to the ongoing global financial&#13;
             crisis. serbia, like many other countries in the europe and Central Asia region, is currently facing difficult fiscal&#13;
             adjustments along with the need for external financing. MIGA's support to the project will supplement the&#13;
             International Monetary Fund's program for serbia by injecting liquidity into the uBsR, boosting confidence in&#13;
             serbia's financial sector, and contributing to the improvement of the country's financial stability.&#13;
&#13;
             one of the main objectives of the World Bank Group's country partnership strategy for serbia for 2008-2011 is to&#13;
             encourage dynamic private sector led growth. the proposed project is fully consistent with this objective.&#13;

         Ukraine        Project Name: can-Pack (Ukraine) ltd.&#13;
                        Guarantee Holder: Can-pack s.A.&#13;
&#13;
                        MIGA has issued a $4.0 million guarantee to Can-pack s.A. of poland covering its new investment in Can-pack&#13;
                        (ukraine) ltd. the new investment will be in the form of equipment and raw materials, to modernize an existing&#13;
                        production line. MIGA is currently providing coverage to the project totaling $49.4 million against the risks of&#13;
                        transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
                        Can-pack s.A.--through subsidiary Can pack (ukraine) ltd.--is the largest producer of beverage cans in ukraine&#13;
                        and fourth largest beverage can producer in europe. the project involves the replacement of old can necking&#13;
                        equipment, which produces 50-cl beverage cans, and extending line capability with machines and tooling for pro-&#13;
                        duction of 33-cl cans. It also involves transfer into ukraine of technical know-how in operating the new equipment.&#13;
&#13;
                        the plant has been operating since 2003. Can-pack's decision to upgrade the equipment to produce the 33-cl&#13;
                        aluminum beverage cans in ukraine is driven by an increase in demand from the soft drink companies, such as&#13;
                        Coca-Cola and pepsi, as well as from the local and regional breweries. Additionally, the demand for 33-cl cans is&#13;
                        also growing from neighboring countries, especially Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. the production of 33-cl cans&#13;
                        in ukraine will allow Can-pack to maintain its competitiveness in the expanding beverage market in ukraine in par-&#13;
                        ticular and the region in general. Can-pack is currently addressing the need by procuring the 33-cl cans from poland,&#13;
                        in turn incurring high transportation costs, which impact its competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                        MIGA's continuing support to Can-pack (ukraine) is consistent with the World Bank Group Country partnership&#13;
                        strategy (Cps) for ukraine for 2008-2011. enhancing technological updates in the manufacturing sector and pro-&#13;

&#13;
                        MIGA has issued a guarantee of $142.5 million covering Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG's (RZB) $150 million&#13;
                        shareholder loan to its leasing subsidiary in ukraine, Raiffeisen leasing Aval llC (RlAv). the coverage is for a&#13;
                        period of up to seven years against the risks of transfer restriction and expropriation of funds.&#13;
&#13;
                        RZB's shareholder loan will enable RlAv to respond to rapidly growing demand for leasing products in ukraine.&#13;
                        RlAv will use the proceeds of the shareholder loan to extend leases of equipment and machinery to ukrainian&#13;
                        enterprises across various sectors. A substantial part of this funding is expected to benefit small and medium-size&#13;
                        enterprises and support investments in agriculture. the sMe sector is an underserved segment of the ukrainian&#13;
                        market as sMes often do not qualify for bank financing and lack the capital to purchase fixed assets to grow their&#13;
                        businesses. RZB's shareholder loan is also expected to help RlAv to increase the share of long-term leases in its&#13;
                        portfolio. this is MIGA's second guarantee in support of RlAv.&#13;

                        ukraine is among the countries in the region hardest hit by the global economic crisis. until september 2008, it&#13;
                        was one of europe's fastest-growing economies, with annual growth of more than 7 percent for eight years. the&#13;
                        crisis has dried up foreign loans, crippled banks with defaults, and triggered massive layoffs.&#13;
&#13;
                        the World Bank Group's country partnership strategy for ukraine emphasizes the need to support the development&#13;
                        of non-bank financial institutions, including leasing companies, to deepen the financial sector, broaden the avail-&#13;
                        ability of financial instruments to ukrainian enterprises, and support private investment. this investment fits well&#13;
                        with the country partnership strategy. First, it promotes the involvement of strategic foreign investors, such as&#13;
                        RZB, that are playing an important role in the development of the leasing industry in ukraine in these difficult&#13;
                        times. second, this project is expected to support investments in the agribusiness sector, an important area for job&#13;
                        creation and development of local industries.&#13;

             ukraine is among the eastern european countries hardest hit by the global financial turmoil. economic growth&#13;
             averaged above 7 percent in the country between 2000 and 2007, but the global downturn has seen investors and&#13;
             lenders withdraw. the country's stocks, banks, and currency have all suffered. MIGA's support to the country's&#13;
             banking sector is part of the Bank Group's efforts to help crisis-hit countries cope with the turmoil in the global&#13;

Brazil       Project Name: serra da Mesa transmissora de Energia s.A&#13;
             Guarantee Holder: Cobra Concesiones s. l.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA has issued a guarantee of e20.9 million to Cobra Instalaciones y servicios s.A. of spain to cover its&#13;
             equity investment in the serra da Mesa transmissora de energia project in Brazil. the coverage is for a&#13;
             period of up to 15 years against the risks of transfer restriction and breach of contract.&#13;
&#13;
             the project consists of the construction, operation, and maintenance of a total of 675 kilometers of 500 kv&#13;
             transmission lines along the north-south axis of the country. the new lines will stretch from the serra da&#13;
             Mesa hydropower plant on Rio tocantins in the state of Goiás to the embrocação hydropower plant on the&#13;
             Rio paranaíba. the project also includes the construction of two new substations, one near the municipality&#13;
             of luziâna in the state of Goiás, and the other near the Municipality of paracatú in the state of Minas Gerais.&#13;
&#13;
             the project is expected to help alleviate the imbalance of electricity supply and demand caused by the&#13;
             geographic distance and climate difference across regions. transmission lines in Brazil tend to cover large&#13;
             distances, resulting from the fact that most energy is produced in hydroelectric dams located far from major&#13;
             energy consumption centers. Interconnected transmission line systems allow for more consistent distribution&#13;
             of energy, as they permit regions of the country to continue receiving energy even if there is a dry spell.&#13;
&#13;
             A more consistent energy source will help ensure that Brazil continues on a path of economic growth. the&#13;
             proposed project is in line with the World Bank's country partnership strategy for Brazil, one of the key&#13;
             objectives of which is to help the country become more competitive by improving its infrastructure.&#13;

Uruguay      Project Name: sierra de luna s.A. (Microfin)&#13;
             Guarantee Holder: Banco de la Microempresa s.A. (Mibanco)&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA has issued a guarantee of $0.95 million to Banco de la Microempresa s.A. (Mibanco) of peru for its&#13;
             investment in Microfinanzas del uruguay s.A. of uruguay. the coverage is for a period of up to three years&#13;
             against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
             the project consists of the establishment and operation of Microfin, a microlending organization in uruguay.&#13;
             the organization is to be a subsidiary of Grupo ACp. the guarantee covers a non-shareholder loan by&#13;
             Mibanco. Microfin plans to focus on micro-loans between $3,500 and $10,000, but it will also provide loans&#13;
             below that range. It also plans to establish an estimated 100 service points throughout the country in order&#13;
             to reach underserved segments of the microfinance market.&#13;
&#13;
             one of Microfin's objectives is to close the existing gap between the demand and supply of financial services&#13;
             to low-income sectors in uruguay. the country's existing financial infrastructure is dominated by large banks&#13;
             and does not meet the needs of some of the most vulnerable groups. Microfin intends to target micro-&#13;
             entrepreneurs (those with ten employees or less). By supporting small businesses, it should help generate&#13;
             employment and improve living standards and may encourage new entrants to uruguay's microfinance&#13;
             market.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA's participation in this project is consistent with the World Bank Country Assistance strategy for&#13;
             uruguay for 2005-2010 which focuses on helping the government attain equitable and sustainable economic&#13;
             development. this is a south-south investment. the project was underwritten through MIGA's small&#13;
             Investment program.&#13;

&#13;
                        MIGA has issued a guarantee of $1.5 million to société Malienne de promotion Hôtelière (sMpH) of Mali, covering&#13;
                        its $6.8 million equity investment in Compagnie Hôtelière du Golfe in Benin. the coverage is for a period of up to&#13;
                        ten years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
                        the project involves the acquisition of the Hotel de la plage in Cotonou, following a competitively bid privatization&#13;
                        process. the existing facility will be demolished and a new 100-room, four-star hotel of international standing will&#13;
                        be built in its place. For the implementation of the project, sMpH will establish a local company--Compagnie&#13;
                        Hôtelière du Golfe s.A.&#13;
&#13;
                        the existing facility is located along the Atlantic coast in the administrative heart of Cotonou. Despite its prime&#13;
                        location, the condition and architectural layout of the existing hotel are not conducive to attracting business&#13;
                        travelers and tourists. the newly designed facility will cater to the needs of business travelers and vacationing&#13;
                        tourists.&#13;
&#13;
                        the project is expected to support the Government of Benin's efforts to reform the public sector, rehabilitate&#13;
                        state-owned assets, and develop the tourism sector. It is expected to provide much-needed modern hotel facilities,&#13;
                        increase the number of visitors and tourists, and contribute to tax revenues and foreign exchange earnings. the&#13;
                        project will generate both skilled and unskilled jobs and transfer proven managerial and technical skills to locals.&#13;
&#13;
                        MIGA's participation in this project is aligned with its strategic priorities, as the issued guarantee supports a project&#13;
                        in an IDA-eligible (among the world's poorest) African country and a south-south investment. the guarantee was&#13;
                        underwritten through the agency's small Investment program.&#13;

&#13;
                        MIGA has issued a guarantee of $4.32 million to Mr. Ralph Freiha, yousef Freiha &amp; sons, Freiha Feed Company&#13;
                        sAl and African Company for oil and Derivatives of lebanon covering their equity investment in Congo oils and&#13;
                        Derivatives sARl in the Democratic Republic of Congo. the coverage is for a period up to ten years against the&#13;
                        risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
                        the project involves the installation and operation of a vegetable oil refinery in the port town of Boma. the plant&#13;
                        will produce refined, bleached and deodorized palm oil, as well as degummed soya bean oil plant. It will have a&#13;
                        capacity of 140 tons of oil per day and will largely serve the local market, which is partially dependent on imports.&#13;
                        there is also a possibility of exporting to neighboring countries, in particular to Angola, a post-conflict economy&#13;
                        with limited industrial capacity.&#13;
&#13;
                        the project is expected to have a positive impact on the country's economy by creating jobs for the local popu-&#13;
                        lation, generating significant annual tax revenues (after year four) for the government, and local procurement of&#13;
                        goods and services, mostly related to transportation, fuel, and utilities, as well as lodging and boarding for expa-&#13;
                        triate personnel.&#13;
&#13;
                        MIGA's support for this investment fits with the World Bank Group's country partnership strategy for DRC for&#13;
                        2008-2011, particularly with regard to laying the foundation for a medium-term poverty reduction effort.&#13;

&#13;
             MIGA has issued a guarantee of e0.46 million to tamboho International ltd. of Mauritius covering its e0.52 million&#13;
             shareholder loan to tamboho s.A. in Madagascar. the coverage is for up to six years against the risks of transfer&#13;
             restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
             the investment relates to a hotel located in the tana Water Front neighborhood in the capital city Antananarivo&#13;
             that will offer amenities for both tourists and business travelers, including conference and leisure facilities. It will&#13;
             meet international standards and accommodate a steady growth in the number of business and leisure travelers&#13;
             to Madagascar. the number of travelers to Antananarivo has been increasing for the past few years at an average&#13;
             annual rate of 15 percent and a further spike in the number of visitors is expected during the African union summit&#13;
             in 2009 and the Francophonie summit in 2010. the supply of hotel rooms in the city does not meet the growing&#13;
             demand.&#13;
&#13;
             the project is expected to have a demonstration effect as other hotels in Antananarivo will want to improve their&#13;
             own accommodations in order to remain competitive. It is expected that the hotel will generate local jobs as well as&#13;
             taxes for the government over the next five years. the hotel will also support the growth of related industries such&#13;
             as transportation, food and beverage providers, and tour operators.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA's participation in this project is aligned with its strategic priorities as the issued guarantee supports a project&#13;
             in an IDA-eligible (among the world's poorest) country, an investment in an African country; and a south-south&#13;
             investment. the project was underwritten through MIGA's small Investment program.&#13;

             MIGA has issued additional coverage in the amount of $12.8 million for the Aarti steel nigeria ltd. (Asnl) project&#13;
             in nigeria. the additional coverage is for $13.5 million in new non-shareholder loans to the project enterprise from&#13;
             the state Bank of India. the coverage is against the risks of expropriation, transfer restriction, and war and civil&#13;
             disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA issued guarantees of $11.4 million to support the project in 2007. the additional coverage of $12.8 million is&#13;
             supporting an expansion of an existing steel galvanizing facility located in otta, ogun state, nigeria.&#13;
&#13;
             Aarti steel nigeria limited has constructed a greenfield manufacturing plant for steel galvanizing in ogun state.&#13;
             this facility has a manufacturing capacity of 50,000 tons a year, and produces galvanized steel coils, galvanized&#13;
             plain steel sheets, and galvanized corrugated (roofing) steel sheets. the expansion entails an increase in the manu-&#13;
             facturing capacity to 100,000 tons a year by setting up an additional galvanizing line. the increased capacity of the&#13;
             plant will allow Asnl to meet the growing demand for processed steel goods in nigeria and neighboring countries.&#13;
             the expansion will deploy the latest state-of-the-art and environmentally friendly technology. When the facility is&#13;
             fully online, it is expected to be the largest local manufacturer.&#13;
&#13;
             nigeria's increasing wealth and population is driving market demand for galvanized plain and galvanized cor-&#13;
             rugated steel sheets. Galvanized corrugated sheets are used as roofing material on nearly all houses in nigeria and&#13;
             the surrounding region. the plain metal sheeting will also be used in a variety of industries including agricultural&#13;
             implements, consumer durable goods, hardware for domestic and industrial construction, railways, and machinery&#13;
             manufacturing. the project will also bring modernized and efficient processes to nigeria's emerging manufacturing&#13;
             sector.&#13;
&#13;
             this project is consistent with nigeria's strategy to develop the non-oil private sector, as well as the World Bank&#13;
             Group's Country partnership strategy which identifies increased foreign direct investment in the non-oil private&#13;
             sector as a critical element of the country's reform efforts. the project also meets MIGA's priorities of supporting&#13;

                        MIGA has issued a guarantee of $6.04 million to ADC Financial services and Corporate Development (ADC) of&#13;
                        Mauritius covering its equity investment in Banque Rwandaise de Développement (BRD). the coverage is for a&#13;
                        period of up to 15 years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
                        BRD--Rwanda's development bank--is owned by the Government of Rwanda, bilateral development agencies and&#13;
                        private investors. ADC has committed $6.5 million equity to acquire a 25 percent stake in BRD through a capital&#13;
                        increase. BRD has two main business lines: lending to small and medium-size enterprises and making equity&#13;
                        investments in greenfield projects that are seen as central to Rwanda's growth.&#13;
&#13;
                        Fostering broad-based growth in economic activity and in the private sector is important for Rwanda's continuing&#13;
                        economic recovery. BRD plays an important role in the creation and development of companies and products that&#13;
                        can contribute to the economic development of Rwanda by providing capital as well as cash vouchers, subscribing&#13;
                        to bonds, and granting short, medium and long-term credits. this project is expected to have a positive impact&#13;
                        on Rwanda's economy by providing BRD with the necessary capital to increase its lending portfolio in the country,&#13;
                        thereby helping it to increase its support for sMes and greenfield businesses.&#13;
&#13;
                        MIGA's participation in this project is aligned with its strategic priorities. the guarantee supports a project in&#13;

&#13;
                        MIGA has issued a guarantee of $9.5 million to ADC It &amp; payment solutions (ADC) of Mauritius covering its&#13;
                        equity investment in the société Monétique et de télé-Compensation au Rwanda (sIMtel) s.A.R.l. the coverage is&#13;
                        for a period of up to 15 years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
                        ADC has acquired a 70 percent stake in sIMtel, the national electronic payment transactions provider, and&#13;
                        operator of the credit card switch and cash systems in Rwanda. ADC's investment includes an equity stake and&#13;
                        materials and equipment for the project.&#13;
&#13;
                        After the acquisition, sIMtel is expected to transition from a subsidiary of the country's financial institutions to an&#13;
                        independent, for-profit company providing services on a fee basis. established in 2002, sIMtel has made limited&#13;
                        progress in developing its business model of providing cost efficient and effective payment systems for its share-&#13;
                        holders and the Rwandan public. By 2007, sIMtel had accumulated significant losses and was in financial dif-&#13;
                        ficulty. As a result of sIMtel's difficulties, the Government of Rwanda launched a tender process to find a foreign&#13;
                        investor who could provide the capital and expertise necessary to turn sIMtel into a viable business. When the&#13;
                        initial tender process did not produce a bidder able to provide the necessary operational expertise and capital, ADC&#13;
                        was invited by the government to propose a solution to sIMtel's operational and financial issues.&#13;
&#13;
                        ADC's action plan includes increasing the number of AtMs; replacing and improving sIMtel's information tech-&#13;
                        nology hardware and software; improving service levels and functionality (i.e., accepting international vIsA cards);&#13;
                        defining a card strategy and executing the implementation of using national ID cards as credit/debit cards.&#13;
&#13;
                        Fostering broad-based growth in economic activity and in the private sector is important for Rwanda's continuing&#13;
                        economic recovery. there is an estimated potential for 5 million credit cardholders in the country. sIMtel's plan&#13;
                        to bring a large segment of the population into the formal economy is expected to have a positive impact on the&#13;
                        economy. (cont'd)&#13;

             MIGA has issued a guarantee of $9.29 million covering an investment by Cotecna Inspection s.A. (Cotecna) of&#13;
             switzerland in its senegal branch. the coverage is for a period of three years against the risks of transfer restriction,&#13;
             expropriation, breach of contract and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
             the project involves the provision of import verification services to importers on behalf of the Government of&#13;
             senegal. Cotecna will provide the services under a three-year Build-operate-transfer concession, which will include&#13;
             the provision, installation, and operation of x-ray scanners and goods in-transit tracking equipment, as a key part of&#13;
             the import verification system for goods entering senegal.&#13;
&#13;
             the import verification services will consist of a risk assessment and the identification of the dutiable valuation&#13;
             and customs classification of each consignment. Where indicated by the risk assessment, an x-ray scanning of&#13;
             containerized imports at the main ports of entry will also be undertaken to verify their conformity with the import&#13;
             declaration.&#13;
&#13;
             Destination Inspection (risk assessment followed by scanning and/or physical inspection) is expected to signifi-&#13;
             cantly reduce the clearance time of import consignments at the points of entry, as well reduce opportunities for&#13;
             pilferage or damage to goods on arrival. this will in turn contribute to lowering the cost of doing business for&#13;
             importers and their clients.&#13;
&#13;
             A more rapid and effective assessment of the customs value of imports is expected to result in protecting or even&#13;
             raising government revenues from import duties and taxes. Moreover, the transparent audit trail provided by the&#13;
             import verification system can be effective in fighting duty evasion and issues in governance, which will also con-&#13;
             tribute to increasing revenue from duties and taxes.&#13;
&#13;
             the project will create jobs for the local population, provide transfer of technology and skills, and contribute to&#13;
             better governance and enhanced fiscal management in the country by creating a transparent documentation trail of&#13;

&#13;
               Iveri payment technologies is a provider of technology for virtual and mobile commerce. the Iveri system conforms&#13;
               to international card association requirements, focusing on products that allow the merchant to aggregate trans-&#13;
               actions from all available media, including online real-time transactions, in a cost-effective manner.&#13;
&#13;
               Iveri will enable merchants to profitably process transactions in places with minimal infrastructure, thereby&#13;
               increasing their access to revenue. As a result, financial institutions in the country will be able to expand their&#13;
               services to rural populations. the expansion of financial services to these communities offers many benefits,&#13;
               including a more secure and convenient way of transacting business and storing capital; increases the ability of the&#13;
               government to collect taxes; and solves the problem of insufficient cash points in remote areas.&#13;

               MIGA's participation in the project is aligned with the Bank Group's priority of supporting investments in middle-&#13;
               income countries. the guarantee supports a south-south investment. It was underwritten through the agency's&#13;

&amp;#12;         MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION and ANALYSIS FY09&#13;
&#13;
         OVERViEW&#13;
&#13;
         established in 1988, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA or "the Agency") is a member of the World Bank Group. the Bank Group&#13;
         also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International&#13;
         Finance Corporation (IFC), and the International Centre for settlement of Investment Disputes (ICsID). MIGA is a legal entity separate and distinct&#13;
         from IBRD, IDA, IFC, and ICsID, with its own charter (the "Convention"), share capital, financial structure, management, and staff. Membership in the&#13;
         Agency, which currently stands at 174, is open to all members of IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA's mission is to promote foreign direct investment (FDI) into developing countries to support economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve&#13;
         peoples' lives. to this end, the agency acts as a multilateral risk mitigator, providing investors and lenders in the international investment community&#13;
         with the level of comfort necessary to invest in developing countries. MIGA's core business is the provision of political risk insurance. In addition, as&#13;
         part of its mandate, the agency carries out complementary activities such as providing dispute resolution, technical assistance, and online investment&#13;
         information and knowledge services to support FDI.&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA is committed to promoting projects that are economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable, and that promise a strong development&#13;
         impact. By providing political risk insurance (pRI) for foreign direct investment in developing countries, MIGA is able to play a critical role in supporting&#13;
         the World Bank Group's broad strategic priorities.&#13;
&#13;
         An important milestone for MIGA was the approval of the amendments to MIGA's operational Regulations granted by the agency's Board of Directors&#13;
         in the fourth quarter of Fy09. the amendments will enable MIGA to better respond to market needs and provide additional pRI products already&#13;
         available in the marketplace.&#13;
&#13;
         since its inception, MIGA has issued $21 billion of guarantees (including amounts issued under the Cooperative underwriting program), in support of&#13;
         600 projects in approximately 100 member countries. the agency has also conducted hundreds of technical assistance activities, as well as multiple&#13;
         programs at regional and global levels in member countries.&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA is financially self-sustaining, and its activities are supported by a robust capital base and a comprehensive risk management framework. the&#13;
         agency prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of America (us GAAp) and&#13;
         International Financial Reporting standards (IFRs).&#13;

&#13;
         MIGA seeks to fulfill its mission in developing member countries by offering pRI, investment dispute resolution, technical assistance, and online&#13;
         investment information and knowledge services.&#13;
&#13;
         Political Risk Insurance (PRI)&#13;
         MIGA provides investment guarantees against certain non-commercial risks (i.e., political risk insurance) to eligible foreign investors for qualified&#13;
         investments in developing member countries. MIGA covers against the risks of 1) transfer restriction and inconvertibility, 2) expropriation, 3) breach&#13;
         of contract, 4) war and civil disturbance, and, as a result of the Board of Directors' April 14, 2009 decision to amend MIGA's operational Regulations,&#13;
         5) the non-honoring of a sovereign financial obligation. Investors may choose any combination of these covers1 (see Box 1). MIGA insures new cross-&#13;
         border investments originating in any MIGA member country, destined for any developing member country. types of investments that can be covered&#13;
         include equity, shareholder and non-shareholder loans, and loan guarantees (provided the loans have a minimum maturity of three years). other forms&#13;
         of investments--such as technical assistance and management contracts, or franchising and licensing agreements--may also be eligible. table 1&#13;

&amp;#12;During Fy09, MIGA supported 12 projects in IDA-eligible countries and ten projects in sub-saharan Africa, which are areas of special focus for the&#13;
agency. In terms of exposure, IDA-eligible countries accounted for 34 percent of the net portfolio as of June 30, 2009, while coverage for projects in&#13;
sub-saharan Africa accounted for 19 percent.&#13;
&#13;
table 2 details the regional distribution of MIGA's gross and net guarantee exposures over the past three years. the total gross and net exposures at&#13;
June 30, 2009 amounted to $7.3 billion and $4.0 billion compared to $6.5 billion and $3.6 billion respectively at the end of Fy08. the percentage of&#13;
net exposure in the europe and Central Asia region increased by 6.7 percent in Fy09, as a result of supporting financial sector clients in the region.&#13;

&#13;
MIGA is able to provide investors with a higher level of investment insurance coverage through the use of reinsurance arrangements with public and&#13;
private insurers. MIGA cedes exposure to its reinsurance partners, thereby enhancing its capacity and allowing it to better manage its risk profile,&#13;
project and country exposure levels. An example of this is the recent treaty Agreement for reinsurance between Hannover Re and MIGA. Whereas&#13;
MIGA assumes the credit risk for its reinsurance partners under facultative reinsurance arrangements, this risk is borne by the investor under the&#13;
Cooperative underwriting program (Cup). MIGA may also act as a reinsurer, assuming investment portfolio exposure from both public (e.g. export&#13;
credit agencies) and private insurers--thereby freeing up their capacity and allowing them to offer additional support to their policyholders.&#13;

&amp;#12;         Technical Assistance (TA)&#13;
         MIGA's technical assistance (tA) program was integrated with that of the World Bank Group's Foreign Investment Advisory service (FIAs) in Fy07 to&#13;
         achieve operational synergies. the agency continues to provide budgetary support for the tA program as well as guidance on its work program, which&#13;
         focuses on sub-saharan African countries, IDA countries, and frontier regions in middle income countries.&#13;
&#13;
         Online Dissemination of Investment-related Information&#13;
         MIGA's online information services include FDI.net (www.fdi.net) and pRI-Center (www.pri-center.com). these help the Agency fulfill its mandate of&#13;
         conducting research and extending knowledge with regard to FDI and political risk-related issues.&#13;
&#13;
         Investment Dispute Resolution&#13;
         Consistent with Article 23 of the MIGA Convention, the agency seeks both to remove impediments to the flow of investment to developing member&#13;
         countries and to encourage the settlement of disputes between investors and host governments. MIGA actively pursues the resolution of disputes&#13;
         affecting MIGA-supported projects. In many cases, these efforts focus on situations in which either a claim has been or is expected to be filed, but&#13;
         MIGA will also assist in resolving problems that are not related to its cover. During Fy09, MIGA assisted investors in Guinea-Bissau, Afghanistan,&#13;
         Guatemala, the Kyrgyz Republic, and nicaragua.&#13;
&#13;
         In appropriate circumstances, the agency will mediate disputes between states and investors not guaranteed by MIGA if such disputes inhibit the flow&#13;
         of additional investment to the country. In such circumstances, MIGA may seek compensation for these services and reimbursement for its costs in&#13;
         conducting the mediation. MIGA has recently agreed, for example, to mediate a dispute between the Republic of seychelles and private investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Outlook and challenges&#13;
&#13;
         Market Trends&#13;
         the disturbance in the financial markets stemming from the tightening of liquidity has had an effect not only on the availability of credit but also on the&#13;
         capacity of the pRI industry to underwrite coverage. At the same time, however, there has been a general increase in perceptions of global risk. thus,&#13;
         the environment is one of countervailing forces: while there is on the one hand less credit to finance deals and a tightening within the pRI market, there&#13;
         is also a greater general perception of risk which means sponsors proceeding with projects will have a greater desire to identify effective risk mitigants.&#13;
&#13;
         Operational Priorities&#13;
         In 2008, MIGA's Board of Directors endorsed an updated operational Directions paper identifying areas of special strategic focus for the Fy09-11&#13;
         period. there are four main operational priorities that are coupled with three guiding principles to implement the strategy. the operational priorities are:&#13;
&#13;
         r    Investments in IDA countries, a key area of comparative advantage for MIGA.&#13;
         r    Investments in conflict-affected countries, an area of increased engagement for the agency over the past few years and where MIGA remains&#13;
              strongly relevant.&#13;
         r    Investment in complex projects, mostly in infrastructure and the extractive industries, often involving government intervention and resulting in a&#13;
              delicate balance of risk-sharing by stakeholders.&#13;
         r    Support for investments between MIGA Category Two countries2 (South-South investments), given the growing proportion of FDI coming from&#13;
              developing countries and the need to provide underserved corporations with political risk insurance.&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA's delivery of these operational priorities will be guided by the need to:&#13;
&#13;
         r    Support and complement World Bank Group strategies articulated for specific countries, as well as its strategic themes.&#13;
         r    Be responsive to clients and the market through greater flexibility in service and product delivery across all markets.&#13;
         r    Promote financial sustainability which will require an efficient use of MIGA's capital and the maintenance of a balanced portfolio.&#13;

         subscribed capital&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA derives its financial strength primarily from the capital it receives from its shareholders and its retained earnings.&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA's Convention established MIGA's authorized capital stock (membership shares) at 100,000 shares--equivalent to $1,082 million--with a pro-&#13;
         vision that the authorized capital stock shall automatically increase upon the admission of a new member to the extent that the total number of&#13;
         authorized shares are sufficient to allow subscription by the new member. As of June 30, 2009, the authorized shares increased to 106,291, equivalent&#13;
         to $1,150.1 million, subscribed by 174 member countries, which now include Iraq and Kosovo who completed their membership requirements this fiscal&#13;
         year. of the membership shares subscribed, 20 percent or $230.0 million had been paid-in and the remaining 80 percent or $920.1 million was subject&#13;
         to call when needed by MIGA to meet its obligations. At June 30, 2009, $112.2 million was in the form of nonnegotiable, non-interest bearing demand&#13;
         obligations (promissory notes). the notes are denominated in freely convertible currencies and are due on demand to meet MIGA's obligations. since&#13;
         inception, MIGA has not encashed any of the promissory notes.&#13;

&amp;#12;on March 29, 1999, MIGA's Council of Governors approved a General Capital Increase (GCI) of 78,559 shares, equivalent to $850 million. the sub-&#13;
scription period ended on March 28, 2003. on March 17, 2003, the Council of Governors approved an amendment to the GCI resolution allowing&#13;
eligible countries to reserve the GCI shares allocated to them by submitting an instrument of contribution before the end of the GCI subscription&#13;
period, and requesting such countries to subscribe to their GCI shares as soon as possible. the reserved shares are issued and corresponding voting&#13;
power accrues when the subscription process reaches completion, i.e. when the requisite payment has been received. no time limit has been set for&#13;
the payment of the reserved shares. As of June 30, 2009, cumulative subscriptions to the GCI totaled 69,303 shares, equivalent to $749.8 million, and&#13;
GCI shares reserved through instruments of contribution totaled 6,959 shares, equivalent to $75.3 million. of the GCI shares subscribed, $132.3 million&#13;
has been paid-in and $617.5 million is callable.&#13;

As of June 30, 2009, MIGA's total subscribed capital amounted to $1,899.9 million, of which $362.3 million was paid-in and $1,537.6 million was callable.&#13;
since its inception, no call has been made on MIGA's callable capital. Any calls on unpaid subscriptions are uniform on all shares. If the amount&#13;
received by MIGA on a call is insufficient to meet the obligations which necessitated the call, MIGA may make further calls until the amounts received&#13;
are sufficient to meet such obligations. the liability of a member on a call or calls is limited to the unpaid balance of its capital subscription.&#13;
&#13;
Equity&#13;
total shareholders' equity as reported in MIGA's balance sheet as of June 30, 2009 was $900 million compared with $891 million as of June 30, 2008.&#13;
this amount consists of subscribed capital, less uncalled portions of subscriptions, plus retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive&#13;
income (loss). the increase of $9 million in Fy09 primarily reflects the increase in retained earnings of $31 million which was offset by the decrease in&#13;
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $26 million.&#13;

Underwriting capacity&#13;
&#13;
MIGA's equity base ensures the financial sustainability of the agency, over both the short-term and long-term. the subscribed capital and retained&#13;
earnings determine the agency's statutory underwriting capacity. the Council of Governors and the Board of Directors have set the maximum amount&#13;
of contingent liability that may be assumed by MIGA as 350 percent of the sum of its unimpaired subscribed capital and reserves and retained earnings,&#13;
90 percent of reinsurance obtained by MIGA with private insurers, and 100 percent of reinsurance obtained with public insurers. In other words, the&#13;
maximum amount of net guarantee exposure is determined by the amount of available capital, and is expressed on a gross exposure basis by adding the&#13;
current amount of portfolio reinsurance. As of June 30, 2009, MIGA's underwriting capacity was $12,096 million, as follows:&#13;

     capital Adequacy&#13;
&#13;
     Following the adoption of its formal economic Capital-based capital adequacy framework in Fy07, MIGA's measures of capital adequacy and risk-&#13;
     bearing capacity include economic capital consumed by the guarantee portfolio. Modeled economic capital (eC) is the portion of MIGA's capital that is&#13;
     placed at risk by the guarantee portfolio exposure. It provides an analytically rigorous measure for assessing the agency's consumption of risk capital,&#13;
     and incorporates the effects from portfolio diversification and concentration. As of June 30, 2009, the economic capital consumed by the guarantee&#13;
     portfolio amounted to $310 million, compared to $250 million as of June 30, 2008.&#13;
&#13;
     through an annual exercise of gauging the capital adequacy position, the current amount of eC consumed by MIGA's activities is calculated to measure&#13;
     how much of available operating capital is currently utilized. In addition, as part of the capital adequacy framework, MIGA assesses how much eC&#13;
     is projected to be utilized in the future under various scenarios of growth and development of the guarantee portfolio. these are stressed scenarios,&#13;
     estimating the eC consumed under assumptions of continued growth to MIGA's portfolio over five years, in combination with increased concentration&#13;
     of exposures, country rating downgrades, and regional and global contagion effects.&#13;
&#13;
     throughout the year, MIGA's management monitors the level and utilization of available operating capital. this includes paid-in-capital, retained&#13;
     earnings, and the insurance portfolio reserve, net of the corresponding reinsurance recoverable. MIGA management's objective is to have sufficient&#13;
     operating capital to sustain losses associated with claims and to support the ongoing business without facing a significant risk of having to avail itself&#13;
     of the callable capital. As a measure of the current utilization of this capital by the guarantee portfolio, table 5 shows the ratio of eC to operating capital&#13;
     over the past three years. this ratio has increased to 29.7 percent in Fy09 compared with 24.6 percent in Fy08. table 5 also shows the ratio of eC to&#13;
     portfolio net exposure, to gauge year-on-year changes to the relative risk-level of the portfolio. As of end-Fy09, this ratio stood at 7.8, percent compared&#13;
     to 7.0 percent at end-Fy08. Due to increasing portfolio concentration in a few countries and a substantial number of country rating downgrades, this&#13;
     ratio reflected the slight increase in the risk level of the guarantee portfolio, taking into account the increased size of the portfolio. together, the two&#13;
     ratios indicate a strong and stable capital position at the end of Fy09.&#13;

MIGA's investment policy sets the objectives and constraints that must be considered in managing MIGA's investment strategy in light of its contingent&#13;
liabilities, which are the investment guarantees it issues. As claims arise, MIGA's invested assets will be liquidated to pay claims on a pre-recovery basis.&#13;
As such, a certain portion of the portfolio is held in highly liquid assets with the amount determined by MIGA's eC model. the amount is equal to&#13;
the capital loss expected to occur within one year with 1 percent probability, plus the amount of MIGA's specific reserve on a gross pre-recovery basis.&#13;
&#13;
At present MIGA's investment portfolio is managed in two tranches subject to the constraints in the Investment Authorization approved by the Board&#13;
of Directors in June 2004. tranche 1 is managed with a risk tolerance of 1 percent probability of annual capital loss over a one-year horizon, reflecting&#13;
the main objective of this tranche to meet near-term liquidity needs described above. tranche 2 is managed with a 1 percent probability of annual capital&#13;
loss over a three-year horizon, reflecting the objective of providing more long-term capital growth. portfolio management activities, including trading,&#13;
risk analytics and reporting, are provided by IBRD's treasury Department under an Investment Management Agreement and the associated Investment&#13;
Management Guidelines between MIGA and IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
the composition of MIGA's investment portfolio is shown in Figure 1. At the end of Fy09, the portfolio held cash, treasury securities, agency securities,&#13;
mortgage-backed securities (MBs), asset-backed securities (ABs), sovereign and government guaranteed securities and derivatives. Also, the portfolio&#13;
held cash and government securities denominated in currencies other than usD. the portfolio yield was 4.1 percent in Fy09 versus 5.3 percent in Fy08.&#13;
And the market value of MIGA's asset portfolio was $951 million as of June 30, 2009, of which $800 million resided in usD investments.&#13;

cRiticAl AccOUNtiNg POliciEs&#13;
&#13;
the footnotes to MIGA's financial statements contain a detailed summary of MIGA's accounting policies. Described below are those significant policies&#13;
where MIGA management is required to form estimates when preparing the agency's financial statements and accompanying notes to conform to both&#13;
IFRs and us GAAp. Accounting estimates generally involve the establishment of parameters by management based on judgments about the probable&#13;
outcome of future conditions, transactions, or events. Because these are projections, actual results may differ from those estimates in a variety of areas.&#13;
the area which management deems most critical with respect to the application of estimates and assumptions is the establishment of its loss reserves.&#13;
&#13;
Reserve for claims&#13;
&#13;
MIGA's provisioning methodology builds on portfolio risk quantification models which use both individually assessed loss probabilities for projects at&#13;
risk and rating-based loss probabilities that are applied to the entire guarantee portfolio. under this methodology, for the purpose of presentation in&#13;
the financial statements, MIGA's reserve consists of two primary components, the specific Reserve and the Insurance portfolio Reserve.4 these com-&#13;
ponents are defined based on the degree of probability and the basis of estimation.&#13;
&#13;
Reserves are shown on a gross basis on the liability side of the balance sheet, and reinsurance assets on the asset side. A detailed summary of MIGA's&#13;
provisioning policy can be found in the notes to Financial statements ­ note A.&#13;

        related to covered forward contracts is -$5.2 million USD or -0.5% of the investment portfolio.&#13;
4       The Insurance Portfolio Reserve is calculated as the 95th percentile loss less the mean loss from the Economic Capital Model.&#13;

     Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits&#13;
&#13;
     Along with IBRD and IFC, MIGA participates in a number of pension and post-retirement benefit plans that cover almost all of their staff members. All&#13;
     costs, assets, and liabilities associated with these plans are allocated among IBRD, IFC, and MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation&#13;
     in the plans. the underlying actuarial assumptions, fair value of plan assets, and funded status associated with these plans are based on financial&#13;
     market interest rates, past experience, and management's best estimate of future benefit changes and economic conditions. For further details, please&#13;

     Operating income and Net income&#13;
&#13;
     Fy09 operating income was $50.6 million, a decrease of $4.4 million versus Fy08 primarily due to lower investment income offset by an increase in net&#13;
     premium income. Fy09 net income of $31.2 million decreased by $34.5 million mainly on account of currency translation losses. table 6 below shows&#13;

     MIGA issued $1.4 billion in guarantees during Fy09, $721 million lower than in Fy08. the lower volume of business issued was directly related to delays&#13;
     in concluding projects already in MIGA's business pipeline. Investors re-evaluated the viability of proceeding with their projects in light of challenging&#13;
     economic conditions. new issues when combined with lower policy cancellations resulted in growth of MIGA's guarantee portfolio and premium&#13;
     income. In Fy09, gross exposure and gross premium income increased by $822 million and $9.7 million, respectively. premium amounts ceded to&#13;

general governance&#13;
&#13;
Board Membership&#13;
In accordance with MIGA's Convention, members of MIGA's Board of Directors are appointed or elected by their member governments. Directors are&#13;
neither officers, nor staff of MIGA. the president is the only management member of the Board of Directors, serving as a non-voting member (except&#13;
when needed to cast a deciding vote in the case of an equal division) and as Chairman of the Board. the Directors have established several committees&#13;
including:&#13;
&#13;
r    Committee on Development effectiveness&#13;
r    Audit Committee&#13;
r    Budget Committee&#13;
r    personnel Committee&#13;
r    ethics Committee&#13;
r    Committee on Governance and Administrative Matters&#13;
&#13;
the Directors and their committees function in continuous session at the principal offices of MIGA, as business requires. each committee's terms&#13;
of reference establishes its respective roles and responsibilities. As committees do not vote on issues, their role is primarily to serve the full Board of&#13;
Directors in discharging its responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
Audit committee&#13;
&#13;
Membership&#13;
the Audit Committee consists of eight members of the Board of Directors. Membership on the Committee is determined by the Board of Directors,&#13;
based upon nominations by the Chairman of the Board, following informal consultation with the Directors. In addition, the composition of the Com-&#13;
mittee is expected to reflect the economic and geographic diversity of MIGA's member countries. other relevant selection criteria include seniority,&#13;
continuity, and relevant experience. some or all of the responsibilities of individual Committee members are performed by their alternates or advisors.&#13;
Generally, Committee members are appointed for a two-year term; reappointment to a second term, when possible, is desirable for continuity. Audit&#13;
Committee meetings are generally open to any member of the Board who wishes to attend, and non-Committee members of the Board may participate&#13;
in the discussion but cannot vote. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee may speak in that capacity at meetings of the Board of Directors,&#13;
with respect to discussions held in the Audit Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Key Responsibilities&#13;
the Audit Committee has a mandate to assist the Board of Directors in overseeing MIGA's finances and accounting, including the effectiveness of&#13;
financial policies, the integrity of financial statements, the system of internal controls regarding finance, accounting and ethics (including mechanisms&#13;
for dealing with fraud and corruption), and financial and operational risks. the Audit Committee is also responsible for recommending to the Board&#13;
of Directors the appointment of the external auditor, as well as monitoring the performance and independence of the external auditor. the Audit Com-&#13;
mittee oversees the internal audit function, including reviewing the responsibilities, staffing and effectiveness of internal audit. the Audit Committee&#13;
likewise reviews the annual internal audit plan, and discusses periodically with management as well as the external and internal auditors financial&#13;
issues and policies which have an impact on the institution's financial position and risk-bearing capacity. the Audit Committee monitors the evolution&#13;
of developments in corporate governance and reports regularly to the Board of Directors on the execution of its duties and responsibilities.&#13;

&amp;#12;     Communications&#13;
     the Audit Committee communicates regularly with the full Board of Directors through distribution of the following documents:&#13;
&#13;
     r    the minutes of its meetings.&#13;
     r    Reports of the Audit Committee prepared by the Chairman, which document discussions held. these reports are distributed to the Directors,&#13;

     under the Audit Committee's terms of reference, members of the Audit Committee shall meet regularly, as circumstances dictate. the Audit Committee&#13;
     may request any member of MIGA staff or management to attend one of its meetings. Furthermore, the Audit Committee meets periodically in separate&#13;
     executive sessions with management, the Auditor General, and the external Auditor to discuss matters it believes should be discussed separately.&#13;
&#13;
     Access to Resources and to Management&#13;
     throughout the year, the Audit Committee receives a large volume of information, with respect to financial condition, financial statement presentations,&#13;
     risk assessment, and risk management, as well as governance and controls. the Audit Committee meets both formally and informally throughout the&#13;
     year to discuss financial and accounting matters. Directors have complete access to management. the Audit Committee reviews and discusses with&#13;
     management the quarterly and annual financial statements. the committee also reviews with the external auditor the financial statements prior to their&#13;
     publication and recommends these for approval to the Board of Directors.&#13;
&#13;
     the Audit Committee has the capacity, under exceptional circumstances, to obtain advice and assistance from outside legal, accounting, or other&#13;
     advisors as deemed appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
     code of Ethics&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA strives to foster and maintain a positive work environment that supports the ethical behavior of its staff. to facilitate this effort, the World Bank&#13;
     Group has in place a Code of professional ethics--living our values. MIGA has adopted the code, which applies to all staff (including managers, con-&#13;
     sultants, and temporary employees) worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
     this code is available in nine languages on IBRD's website, www.worldbank.org. staff relations, conflicts of interest, and operational issues, including&#13;
     the accuracy of books and records, are key elements of the code.&#13;
&#13;
     In addition to the code, an essential element of appropriate conduct is compliance with the obligations embodied in the principles of staff employment,&#13;
     staff Rules, and Administrative Rules, the violation of which may result in disciplinary actions. In accordance with the staff Rules, senior managers must&#13;
     complete a confidential financial disclosure instrument with the office of ethics and Business Conduct.&#13;
&#13;
     Guidance for staff is also provided through programs, training materials, and other resources. Managers are responsible for ensuring that internal&#13;
     systems, policies, and procedures are consistently aligned with MIGA's ethical goals. In support of its efforts on ethics, MIGA offers a variety of methods&#13;
     for informing staff of these resources. Many of these efforts are headed by the following groups:&#13;
&#13;
     r    the office of ethics and Business Conduct (eBC) provides leadership, management and oversight for MIGA's ethics infrastructure including the&#13;
          ethics Helpline, a consolidated conflicts of interest disclosure/resolu¬tion system, financial disclosure, ongoing training to both internal and&#13;
          external audi¬ences, and communication resources.&#13;
     r    the Integrity vice presidency (Int) is charged with investigating allegations of fraud and corruption in projects benefiting from World Bank Group&#13;
          funding or guarantees. the Department also investigates allegations of misconduct by MIGA staff and trains and educates staff and clients in&#13;
          detecting and reporting fraud and corruption in MIGA-guaranteed projects. the Department reports directly to the president and is composed of&#13;
          professionals from a range of disciplines including financial analysts, researchers, investigators, lawyers, prosecutors, forensic accountants, and&#13;
          staff with operational experience across the World Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA has in place procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received regarding accounting, internal control and auditing mat-&#13;
     ters, including close collaboration with eBC and Int.&#13;

&amp;#12;Auditor independence&#13;
&#13;
In February 2003, the Board of Directors adopted a set of principles applicable to the appointment of the external auditor for the World Bank Group.&#13;
Key features of those principles include:&#13;
&#13;
r    prohibition of the external auditor from the provision of all non audit-related services&#13;
r    Certain extremely and strictly limited audit-related consulting services must be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Board of Directors,&#13;
     upon recom¬mendation by the Audit Committee&#13;
r    Mandatory rebidding of the external audit contract every five years&#13;
r    prohibition of any firm serving as external auditors for more than two consecutive five-year terms&#13;
r    Mandatory rotation of the senior partner after five years&#13;
r    An evaluation of the performance of the external auditor at the mid-point of the five year term&#13;
&#13;
external auditors are appointed to a five-year term of service. this is subject to annual reappointment based on the recommendation of the Audit&#13;
Committee and approval of a resolution by the executive Directors. Following a mandatory re-bidding of the external audit contract during Fy 2008,&#13;
IBRD's executive Directors approved the appointment of KpMG as the WBG's auditors for a five-year term commencing Fy 2009.&#13;
&#13;
As standard practice, the external auditor is present as an observer at virtually all Audit Committee meetings and is frequently asked to present its&#13;
perspective on issues. In addition, the Audit Committee meets periodically with the external auditor in private sessions without the presence of&#13;
management. Communication between the external auditor and the Audit Committee is ongoing, as frequently as is deemed necessary by either&#13;
party. MIGA's auditors follow the communication requirements with audit committees set out under us Generally Accepted Auditing standards and&#13;
International standards on Auditing. In keeping with these standards, significant formal communications include:&#13;
&#13;
r    Quarterly and annual financial statement reporting&#13;
r    Annual appointment of the external auditors&#13;
r    presentation of the external audit plan&#13;
r    presentation of control recommendations and discussion of the Coso attestation and report&#13;
r    presentation of a statement regarding independence&#13;
&#13;
In addition to committee meetings, individual members of the Audit Committee have independent access to the external auditor.&#13;

         PURPOsE&#13;
&#13;
         the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988 and located in Washington D.C., is a member of the World Bank&#13;
         Group which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the&#13;
         International Development Association (IDA). MIGA's activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall development objectives of&#13;
         the other World Bank institutions. MIGA is designed to help developing countries attract productive foreign investment by both private investors and&#13;
         commercially operated public sector companies. Its facilities include guarantees or insurance against noncommercial risks and a program of advisory&#13;
         services and technical assistance to support member countries' efforts to attract and retain foreign direct investment.&#13;

         Basis of Preparation&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting standards (IFRs) issued by the International&#13;
         Accounting standards Board (IAsB) and with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of America (u.s. GAAp). the policy&#13;
         adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA having regard to its legal requirements and to the practices of other inter-&#13;
         national insurance entities. on August 5, 2009, MIGA's Board of Directors approved the financial statements for issue.&#13;
&#13;
         Accounting and Reporting developments&#13;
&#13;
         the IAsB issued IFRs 4, Insurance Contracts in March 2004 to achieve convergence of widely varying insurance industry accounting practices around&#13;
         the world. IAsB has divided the insurance project into two phases. In line with the requirements of phase 1, MIGA included additional disclosures&#13;
         beginning the quarter ended september 30, 2005 that identify and explain the amounts in the financial statements arising from insurance contracts.&#13;
         the IAsB exposure draft on phase 2 of the project is expected to come into effect in 2011. this will address issues relating to insurance accounting.&#13;
&#13;
         In March 2008, the Financial Accounting standards Board (FAsB) issued the statement of Financial Accounting standard no. 161, Disclosures about&#13;
         Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAs 161). FAs 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging&#13;
         activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to better understand their effects on an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.&#13;
         FAs 161 was adopted by MIGA during the quarter ended March 31, 2009.&#13;
&#13;
         In May 2008, the FAsB issued the statement of Financial Accounting standards no. 163, Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts, an&#13;
         Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60 (FAs 163). For certain financial insurance guarantee contracts, this statement addresses premium revenue&#13;
         recognition, claim liability recognition and disclosures related to each. except for certain disclosures that are applicable for quarter ending september&#13;
         30, 2008 onwards, this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. FAs 163 will not impact MIGA's financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
         In April 2009, the FAsB issued Fsp FAs 115-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other Than Temporary Impairments (Fsp FAs 115-2). Fsp FAs 115-2&#13;
         requires a company to recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security classified as available­for-sale or&#13;
         held-to-maturity in income and the non-credit component in accumulated other comprehensive income when the company does not intend to sell the&#13;
         security and it is more likely than not the company will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery. Fsp FAs 115-2 also changes the threshold&#13;
         for determining when an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred with respect to intent and ability to hold until recovery and requires additional&#13;
         disclosures. Fsp FAs 115-2 will not impact MIGA's financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
         In April 2009, the FAsB issued Fsp FAs 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly&#13;
         Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (Fsp FAs 157-4). Fsp FAs 157-4 provides guidance for estimating fair value in accordance&#13;
         with FAs no. 157, Fair Value Measurement (FAs 157), when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and&#13;
         for identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. Fsp FAs 157-4 will not have a material impact on MIGA's financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
         In June 2009, the FAsB issued the statement of Financial Accounting standard no. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets--an amendment&#13;
         of FASB Statement No. 140. the FAsB's objective is to address (1) practices that have developed since the issuance of FAsB statement no. 140,&#13;
         Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, that are not consistent with the original intent and key&#13;
         requirements of that statement and (2) concerns of financial statement users that many of the financial assets (and related obligations) that have been&#13;
         derecognized should continue to be reported in the financial statements of transferors. this statement must be applied as of the beginning of each&#13;
         reporting entity's first annual reporting period that begins after november 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and&#13;
         for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. earlier application is prohibited. this statement must be applied to transfers occurring on or after&#13;
         the effective date. FAs 166 will not impact MIGA's financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
         In June 2009, the FAsB issued the statement of Financial Accounting standard no. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). the FAsB's&#13;
         objective is to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities. the Board undertook this project to address (1) the&#13;
         effects on certain provisions of FAsB Interpretation no. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as a result of the&#13;
         elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity concept in FAsB statement no. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, and (2) constituent&#13;

&amp;#12;concerns about the application of certain key provisions of Interpretation 46(R), including those in which the accounting and disclosures under the&#13;
Interpretation do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprise's involvement in a variable interest entity. this statement shall&#13;
be effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity's first annual reporting period that begins after november 15, 2009, for interim periods within&#13;
that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. earlier application is prohibited. FAs 167 will not impact&#13;
MIGA's financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
differences between Us gAAP and iFRs&#13;
&#13;
on september 29, 2006, the FAsB issued the statement of Financial Accounting standard no. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension&#13;
and Other Postretirement Plans (FAs 158). FAs 158 requires employers to recognize on their balance sheets the funded status of their defined benefit&#13;
postretirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. Gains or losses and prior service&#13;
costs or credits that arise during the period are recognized as part of other Comprehensive Income, to the extent they are not recognized as com-&#13;
ponents of the net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, upon adoption, FAs 158 requires unrecognized net actuarial gains or losses and unrecognized&#13;
prior service costs to be recognized in the ending balance of Accumulated other Comprehensive Income. these amounts will be adjusted as they are&#13;
subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, based upon the current amortization and recognition requirements of statement&#13;
of Financial Accounting standard no. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions (FAs 87) and statement of Financial Accounting standards no. 106,&#13;
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (FAs 106). FAs 158 was adopted by MIGA effective June 30, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
MIGA's accounting policy under International Accounting standards (IAs) 19, Employee Benefits is to recognize all actuarial gains and losses in the&#13;
period in which they occur--but outside profit or loss--"in a statement of changes in shareholder's equity." this is a permitted alternative available&#13;
under IAs 19 and MIGA considers that this will allow it to show the over/under funded position on the balance sheet thereby making its financial&#13;
statements more relevant and complete. sFAs 158 requires prospective application of the standard, while the change in approach under IAs 19 requires&#13;
retrospective application. In addition, sFAs 158 and IAs 19 differ in the treatment of amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. sFAs 158&#13;
requires the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses to be amortized to the statement of Income, and IAs 19 requires the unrecognized actuarial&#13;
gains or losses to remain in Accumulated other Comprehensive Income. MIGA does not believe the differences are material.&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates&#13;
&#13;
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting standards and accounting principles generally accepted in&#13;
the united states of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.&#13;
Actual results could differ from these estimates.&#13;
&#13;
significant judgments have been made in areas which management views as most critical with respect to the establishment of its loss reserves, the&#13;
determination of net periodic income from pension and other post retirement benefits plans, and the present value of benefit obligations.&#13;
&#13;
the significant accounting policies employed by MIGA are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
Cash&#13;
Cash includes cash and cash equivalents which consist primarily of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and remaining&#13;
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.&#13;
&#13;
Investments&#13;
MIGA manages its investment portfolio both for the purpose of providing liquidity for potential claims and for capital growth. MIGA invests in time&#13;
deposits, mortgage/asset-backed securities and government and agency obligations based on its investment policy approved by the Board. Government&#13;
and agency obligations include highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills and other obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments&#13;
of countries or other official entities including government agencies or by multilateral organizations. MIGA makes limited use of derivatives contracts&#13;
such as exchange traded futures, options and covered forward contracts to manage its investment portfolio. the purposes of these transactions are&#13;
to enhance the return and manage the overall duration of the portfolio. With respect to futures and options, MIGA generally closes out most open&#13;
positions prior to expiration. Futures are settled on a daily basis.&#13;
&#13;
MIGA has classified all investment securities as trading. Investments classified as trading securities are reported at fair value using trade-date accounting.&#13;
securities purchased or sold may have a settlement date that is different from the trade-date. securities purchased that could not be settled before the&#13;
reporting dates are recorded as liability. similarly, securities sold that could not be settled before the reporting dates are recorded under other Assets.&#13;
&#13;
For trading securities, unrealized net gains and losses are recognized in earnings. Income from investments includes net gains and losses and interest&#13;
income.&#13;
&#13;
Nonnegotiable, Noninterest-bearing Demand Obligations on Account of Subscribed Capital&#13;
payments on these instruments are due to MIGA upon demand and are held in bank accounts which bear MIGA's name. Accordingly, these instruments&#13;
are carried and reported at face value as assets on the balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Impairment of Reinsurance Assets&#13;
MIGA assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that the reinsurance asset is impaired, and makes a provision for such&#13;
impairment. objective evidence may be in the form of observable data that comes to MIGA's attention periodically. If an impairment is determined,&#13;
the carrying amount of the reinsurance asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the&#13;
statement of Income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          FiNANciAl stAtEMENts MIGA AnnuAl RepoRt 09                             |   89&#13;
&amp;#12;     Reserve for Claims&#13;
     MIGA's reserve consists of two primary components, the specific Reserve and the Insurance portfolio Reserve. these components are comprehensive&#13;
     and mutually exclusive with respect to risk of losses that may develop from each guarantee contract, and from the contingent liability for the portfolio&#13;
     as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
     the specific Reserve is calculated based on contract-specific parameters that are reviewed every quarter by MIGA Management for contracts that have&#13;
     known difficulties. the Insurance portfolio Reserve is calculated based on the long-term historical experiences of the political risk industry.&#13;
&#13;
     Assumptions and parameters used in the calculations are intended to serve as the basis for an objective reserve for probable claims. Key assumptions,&#13;
     including frequency of claim, severity, and expected recovery have been quantitatively derived from the political risk insurance industry's historical claims&#13;
     data. the principal sources of data used as inputs for the assumptions include the Berne union and the overseas private Investment Corporation&#13;
     (opIC). the historical analysis of the data from those sources is further augmented by an internal econometric scoring analysis in order to derive risk-&#13;
     differentiated parameters with term structure effects over time. the historical and econometric analyses cover periods that are over 30 years, and the&#13;
     derived parameters are considered stable in the short term; however the analyses are reviewed every three years. short-term risk changes are captured&#13;
     by changes in internal risk ratings for countries and contracts on a quarterly basis. For the purpose of claims provisioning, MIGA discounts its reserves&#13;
     based on the 10-year u.s. treasury rate.&#13;
&#13;
     For the purpose of the presentation of the financial statements, insurance liabilities (or reserves) are presented on a gross basis and not net of rein-&#13;
     surance. therefore, MIGA's reserve is shown on a gross basis on the liability side of the balance sheet, while establishing reinsurance assets on the&#13;
     asset side. Reinsurance does not relieve MIGA of its primary liability to the insured.&#13;
&#13;
     Currency Translation&#13;
     Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at market exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Income and expenses&#13;
     are translated at either the market exchange rates in effect on the dates on which they are recognized or at an average of the market exchange rates in&#13;
     effect during each month. translation adjustments are reflected in the statement of Income.&#13;
&#13;
     Valuation of Capital Stock&#13;
     under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock of MIGA shall be settled on the basis of the average value&#13;
     of the special Drawing Rights (sDR) introduced by the International Monetary Fund, as valued in terms of united states dollars for the period January&#13;
     1, 1981 to June 30, 1985, such value being equal to $1.082 for one sDR.&#13;
&#13;
     Revenue Recognition&#13;
     premium amounts received on direct insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts assumed can be annual, semi-annual or quarterly and are recorded&#13;
     as unearned premium. premiums are recognized as earned on a pro rata basis over the contract period. A receivable for premium is recorded when&#13;
     the contract has been renewed and coverage amounts have been identified.&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business by obtaining treaty and facultative reinsurance to augment its underwriting capacity and to&#13;
     mitigate its risk by protecting portions of its insurance portfolio. premiums ceded (net of commission) follow the same approach as for direct insurance&#13;
     contracts and are recognized as expenses on a pro rata basis over the contract period.&#13;

     MIGA classifies all investment securities as trading. Investments classified as trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses&#13;
     included in earnings. the unrealized net gains included in Income from investments for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 are&#13;
     $6,240,000 and $394,000 respectively.&#13;
&#13;
     Income from derivatives instruments amounted to $2,831,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Income from derivative instruments mainly&#13;
     relate to interest rate futures, options and covered forwards and are recorded under Income from investments in the statement of Income.&#13;
&#13;
     Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157)&#13;
     FAs 157 defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs&#13;
     used to measure fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements.&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA has an established process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. Financial instruments for&#13;
     which quoted market prices are not readily available are valued based on discounted cash flow models. these models primarily use market-based or&#13;
     independently sourced market parameters such as yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. to ensure that the&#13;
     valuations are appropriate where internally-developed models are used, MIGA has various controls in place, which include both internal and periodic&#13;
     external verification and review.&#13;
&#13;
     Fair Value Hierarchy&#13;
     FAs 157 establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy under which financial instruments are categorized based on the priority of the inputs to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;valuation technique. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1), the&#13;
next highest priority to observable market-based inputs or inputs that are corroborated by market data (level 2) and the lowest priority to unobservable&#13;
inputs that are not corroborated by market data (level 3). When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level&#13;
within which fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.&#13;
thus, a level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable and unobservable. Additionally, FAs 157 requires that the valuation&#13;
techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.&#13;
&#13;
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:&#13;
&#13;
level 1: Financial assets whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.&#13;
&#13;
level 2: Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for&#13;
identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; or pricing models for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly&#13;
for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.&#13;
&#13;
level 3: Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and&#13;
significant to the overall fair value measurement.&#13;

         the MIGA Convention established MIGA's authorized capital stock at 100,000 shares with a provision that the authorized capital stock shall automat-&#13;
         ically increase on the admission of a new member to the extent that the then authorized shares are insufficient to provide the shares to be subscribed&#13;
         by such member. At June 30, 2009, the initial authorized capital stock increased to 184,850 (184,404 ­ June 30, 2008) shares. the Convention further&#13;
         states that 10 percent of the members' initial subscription be paid in cash, in freely convertible currencies, except that developing member countries&#13;
         may pay up to a quarter of the 10 percent in their own currencies. An additional 10 percent of the initial subscription shall be paid in the form of non&#13;
         negotiable, non interest bearing promissory notes. the notes are denominated in freely convertible currencies and are due on demand to meet MIGA's&#13;
         obligations. the remaining 80 percent is subject to call when required by MIGA to meet its obligations.&#13;
&#13;
         on March 29, 1999, the Council of Governors approved a General Capital Increase (GCI) resolution increasing the authorized capital stock of MIGA&#13;
         by 78,559 shares to be subscribed by members during the subscription period ending March 28, 2002. of the additional capital, 17.65 percent is to be&#13;
         paid in cash, in freely usable currency. the remaining 82.35 percent is subject to call when required by MIGA to meet its obligations. on May 6, 2002,&#13;
         the Council of Governors adopted a resolution to extend the GCI subscription period to March 28, 2003. on March 17, 2003, the Council of Governors&#13;
         approved an amendment to the GCI resolution allowing eligible countries to subscribe to the GCI shares allocated to them by submitting an Instrument&#13;
         of Contribution before the GCI deadline of March 28, 2003, and requesting such countries to pay for their GCI shares as soon as possible. the reserved&#13;
         shares will be issued and corresponding voting power will accrue when the subscription process has been completed.&#13;
&#13;
         During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, 815 shares were subscribed by member countries. At June 30, 2009, MIGA's authorized capital stock com-&#13;
         prised 184,850 shares of which 175,594 (174,779 ­ June 30, 2008) shares had been subscribed. each share has a par value of sDR10,000, valued at the&#13;
         rate of $1.082 per sDR. of the subscribed capital, $362,364,000 ($360,694,000 ­ June 30, 2008) has been paid in; and the remaining $1,537,563,000&#13;

         guarantee Program&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss caused by non-commercial risks (political risk insurance) to eligible investors on qualified&#13;
         investments in developing member countries. MIGA insures investments for up to 20 years against four different categories of risk: currency&#13;
         inconvertibility and transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract. Currency inconvertibility and transfer&#13;
         restriction coverage protects the investor against inconvertibility of local currency into foreign exchange for transfer outside the host country.&#13;
         Currency depreciation is not covered. expropriation coverage protects the investor against partial or total loss of the insured investment as a&#13;
         result of acts by the host government that may reduce or eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured investment. War and civil&#13;
         disturbance coverage protects the investor against losses from damage to, or the destruction or disappearance of, tangible covered assets, as&#13;
         well as a total loss due to business interruption extending for a period of at least 180 days, caused by politically motivated acts of war or civil&#13;
         disturbance in the host country including revolution, insurrection, coup d'etat, sabotage and terrorism. Breach of contract coverage protects the&#13;
         investor against the inability to enforce an award arising out of an arbitral or judicial decision recognizing the breach of a covered obligation by&#13;
         the host government. Investors may insure projects by purchasing any combination of the four coverages. MIGA guarantees cannot be terminated&#13;
         unilaterally by the guarantee holder within the first three years from the date of issuance without payment of a termination fee except as provided&#13;
         in the contract. MIGA cannot terminate the contract unless the guarantee holder defaults on its contractual obligations to MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
         premium rates applicable are set forth in the contracts. payments against all claims under a guarantee may not exceed the maximum amount of&#13;
         coverage issued under the guarantee. under breach of contract coverage, payments against claims may not exceed the lesser of the amount of&#13;
         guarantee and the arbitration award.&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA also acts as administrator of some investment guarantee trust funds. MIGA, on behalf of the trust funds, issues guarantees against loss&#13;
         caused by non-commercial risks to eligible investors on qualified investments in the countries specified in the trust fund agreements. under the&#13;
         trust fund agreements, MIGA, as administrator of the trust funds, is not liable on its own account for payment of any claims under contracts of&#13;
         guarantees issued by MIGA on behalf of such trust funds which at June 30, 2009 amounts to $2,714,000 ($3,517,000 ­ June 30, 2008).&#13;

&amp;#12;contingent liability&#13;
&#13;
the maximum amount of contingent liability of MIGA under guarantees issued and outstanding at June 30, 2009 totaled $7,297,113,000 ($6,475,136,000&#13;
­ June 30, 2008). A contract of guarantee issued by MIGA may permit the guarantee holder, at the start of each contract period, to elect coverage and&#13;
place amounts both on current and standby. MIGA is currently at risk for amounts placed on current. the maximum amount of contingent liability is&#13;
MIGA's maximum exposure to insurance claims, which includes "standby" coverage for which MIGA is committed but not currently at risk. At June 30,&#13;
2009, MIGA's actual exposure to insurance claims, exclusive of standby coverage is $6,477,848,000 ($5,159,055,000 ­ June 30, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reinsurance&#13;
&#13;
MIGA obtains treaty and facultative reinsurance (both public and private) to augment its underwriting capacity and to mitigate its risk by protecting&#13;
portions of its insurance portfolio, and not for speculative reasons. All reinsurance contracts are ceded on a proportionate basis. However, MIGA is&#13;
exposed to reinsurance non-performance risk in the event that reinsurers fail to pay their proportionate share of the loss in case of a claim. MIGA&#13;
manages this risk by requiring that private sector reinsurers be rated by at least two of the four major rating agencies (standard &amp; poor's, A.M. Best,&#13;
Moody's and Fitch), and that such ratings be above a minimum threshold. In addition, MIGA may also place reinsurance with public insurers of&#13;
member countries that operate under and benefit from the full faith and credit of their governments and with multilateral agencies that represent an&#13;
acceptable counterparty risk. MIGA has established limits, at both the project and portfolio levels, which restrict the amount of reinsurance that may&#13;
be ceded. the project limit states that MIGA may cede no more than 90 percent of any individual project. the portfolio limit states that MIGA may not&#13;
reinsure more than 50 percent of its aggregate gross exposure.&#13;
&#13;
of the $7,297,113,000 outstanding contingent liability (gross exposure) as at June 30, 2009 ($6,475,136,000 ­ June 30, 2008), $3,331,302,000 was ced-&#13;
ed through contracts of reinsurance ($2,897,318,000 ­ June 30, 2008). net exposure amounted to $3,965,811,000 as at June 30, 2009 ($3,577,818,000&#13;
­ June 30, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
MIGA can also provide both public (official) and private insurers with facultative reinsurance. As of June 30, 2009, total insurance assumed by MIGA,&#13;
primarily with official investment insurers, amounted to $120,000,000 ($0 ­ June 30, 2008).&#13;

Portfolio Risk Management&#13;
&#13;
Controlled acceptance of political risk in developing countries is MIGA's core business. the underwriting of such risk requires a comprehensive risk&#13;
management framework to analyze, measure, mitigate and control risk exposures.&#13;
&#13;
Claims risk, the largest risk for MIGA, is the risk of incurring a financial loss as a result of a claimable political risk event in developing countries. political&#13;
risk assessment forms an integral part of MIGA's underwriting process and includes the analysis of both country-related and project-related risks.&#13;
&#13;
Country risk assessment is a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Ratings are assigned individually to each risk for which MIGA provides&#13;
insurance coverage in a country. Country ratings are reviewed and updated every quarter. Country risk assessment forms the basis of the underwriting&#13;
of insurance contracts, setting of premium levels, and provisioning for claims.&#13;
&#13;
project-specific risk assessment is performed by a cross-functional team. Based on the analysis of project-specific risk factors within the country&#13;
context, the final project risk ratings can be higher or lower than the country ratings of a specific coverage. the decision to issue an insurance contract&#13;
is subject to approval by MIGA's senior Management and concurrence by the Board of Directors. In order to avoid excessive risk concentration, MIGA&#13;
sets exposure limits per country and per project. the maximum net exposure which may be assumed by MIGA is $600 million in each host country&#13;
and $180 million for each project.&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                             FiNANciAl stAtEMENts MIGA AnnuAl RepoRt 09                                |   93&#13;
&amp;#12;     As approved by the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the maximum aggregate amount of contingent liabilities that may be assumed by&#13;
     MIGA is 350 percent of the sum of MIGA's unimpaired subscribed capital and its retained earnings, and insurance portfolio reserve plus such portion of&#13;
     the insurance ceded by MIGA through contracts of reinsurance as the Board of Directors may determine. Accordingly, at June 30, 2009, the maximum&#13;
     level of guarantees outstanding (including reinsurance) may not exceed $12,096,000,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Portfolio diversification&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA aims to diversify its guarantee portfolio so as to limit the concentration of exposure to loss in a host country, region, or sector. the portfolio&#13;
     shares of the top five and top ten largest exposure countries provide an indicator of concentration risk. the gross and net exposures of the top five and&#13;
     top ten countries at June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 are as follows:&#13;

     A regionally diversified portfolio is desirable for MIGA as an insurer, because correlations of claims occurrences are typically higher within a region than&#13;
     between regions. When a correlation is higher, the probability of simultaneous occurrences of claims will be higher.&#13;

amounted to $12,600,000 ($33,600,000-June 30, 2008).&#13;

the charge of $1,853,000 for provision for claims, net of reinsurance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 ($9,000,000- fiscal year ended June 30,&#13;
2008) has primarily resulted from an increase in the level of guarantee exposure and ratings downgrades for a number of countries which were partially&#13;
offset by reduced estimated claims probability for one contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Specific Reserve for claims&#13;
&#13;
the specific reserve for claims is composed of reserves for pending claims and reserves for contracts where a claimable event, or events that may give&#13;
rise to a claimable event, may have occurred, but in relation to which no claim has been filed, but where a loss is probable. the parameters used in&#13;
calculating the specific reserves, i.e. claims probability, severity and expected recovery, are assessed for each contract placed in the specific reserves on&#13;
a quarterly basis. At June 30, 2009, the specific reserves amounted to $24,500,000 ($55,200,000 ­ June 30, 2008).&#13;

&amp;#12;     Pending claims&#13;
&#13;
     on october 6, 2004, MIGA received claims for expropriation of projects in Kyrgyz Republic. the maximum aggregate liability under the contracts is&#13;
     $0.9 million. A settlement Agreement has been negotiated, but is not yet effective. negotiations between the Guarantee Holders and the Government&#13;
     of Kyrgyz Republic are on-going. MIGA is maintaining the provision for this matter until the agreement is implemented. MIGA's ultimate liability for&#13;
     this claim has not yet been determined as the claim has not been settled.&#13;
&#13;
     claims Paid&#13;
&#13;
     For the year ended June 30, 2009, MIGA paid two claims. MIGA paid $491,000 for a war and civil disturbance claim received on January 24, 2008 for&#13;
     losses related to a project in Kenya. MIGA paid $13,000 for a war and civil disturbance claim received on March 25, 2009 for losses related to a project&#13;
     in Madagascar. Reinsurance recovered on the claims paid amounted to $51,000.&#13;

     MIGA uses June 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the amounts presented below reflect MIGA's respective&#13;
     share of the costs, assets, and liabilities of the plans.&#13;
&#13;
     All costs, assets and liabilities associated with these pension plans are allocated between MIGA, IBRD, and IFC based upon their employees' respective&#13;
     participation in the plans. In addition, MIGA and IFC reimburse IBRD for their proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
     Contributions to these plans are calculated as a percentage of salary.&#13;

&amp;#12;Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
the actuarial assumptions used are based on financial market interest rates, past experience, and management's best estimate of future benefit&#13;
changes and economic conditions. Changes in these assumptions will impact future benefit costs and obligations.&#13;
&#13;
the expected long-term rate of return for the sRp assets is a weighted average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for the various&#13;
asset classes, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed using a forward-looking building block approach and are not&#13;
strictly based on historical returns. equity returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected&#13;
long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk premium/spread (as appro-&#13;
priate). other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to equity and bond markets. the expected long-term rate of return for the RsBp&#13;
is computed using procedures similar to those used for the sRp. the discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference&#13;
to the year-end AAA and AA corporate bonds.&#13;
&#13;
Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual results are different from expected results. Amortization of these unrecognized gains and losses will be&#13;
included in income if, at the beginning of the fiscal year, they exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related&#13;
value of plan assets. If required, the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the expected average remaining service lives of the employee&#13;
group.&#13;
&#13;
the following tables present the weighted-average assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic pension&#13;
costs for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008:&#13;

&amp;#12;      Investment Strategy&#13;
      the investment policy for the sRp and the RsBp is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the respective plan's needs and goals,&#13;
      using a global diversified portfolio of various asset classes. specifically, the long-term asset allocation is based on an analysis that incorporates expected&#13;
      returns by asset class as well as volatilities and correlations across asset classes and the liability profile of the respective plans, especially in the case&#13;
      of sRp. this analysis also provides estimates of potential future contributions and future asset and liability balances. In February 2009, the pension&#13;
      Finance Committee approved an interim strategic asset allocation (reflected in the table below) for the RsBp based on the asset allocation as of&#13;
      December 2008, pending resumption of work on a detailed strategic asset allocation review after market conditions stabilize in the wake of the recent&#13;
      crisis. plan assets are managed by external investment managers and monitored by IBRD's pension investment department. the pension plan assets&#13;
      are invested in diversified portfolios of public equity, fixed income, and alternative investments.&#13;
&#13;
      the following table presents the asset allocation as of June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 and the respective target allocation by asset category for the&#13;

&#13;
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between&#13;
market participants at the measurement date. MIGA uses observable market data, when available, and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs&#13;
when determining fair value. the fair values of MIGA's cash and non-negotiable, non interest-bearing demand obligations approximate their carrying&#13;
values. the fair values of government obligations are based on quoted market prices and the fair values of asset backed securities are based on pricing&#13;
models for which market observable inputs are used. the degree to which management judgment is involved in determining the fair value of a financial&#13;
instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and&#13;
have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. substantially all of MIGA's&#13;
financial instruments use either of the foregoing methodologies to determine fair values that are recorded on its financial statements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
the responsibility for approving MIGA's risk management policies lies with the Board of Directors. the Audit Committee of the Board deals with risk&#13;
management issues.&#13;
&#13;
While the executive vice president assumes the responsibility for overall risk management with the support of the senior management team, the&#13;
responsibility for the design and operational implementation of the risk management framework lies with the Finance and Risk Management Group&#13;
with coordination from the legal Affairs and Claims Group, the operations Group and the economics and policy Group.&#13;
&#13;
Risk Categories&#13;
MIGA is exposed to a variety of risks and uses risk management programs such as an economic Capital Framework, and reinsurance arrangements to&#13;
manage its risk. Below is a description of risk management systems of the important risks for MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
insurance Risk political risk assessment forms an integral part of MIGA's underwriting process, and includes the analysis of both country-related&#13;
and project-related risks. Insurance risk arises from MIGA's core business of issuing investment guarantees. MIGA's earnings depend upon the extent&#13;
to which claims experience is consistent with assumptions used in setting prices for products and establishing technical provisions and liabilities for&#13;
claims. If actual claims experience of the Agency is less favorable than underlying assumptions, then income would be reduced. MIGA monitors claim&#13;
activities and provisions for pending claims.&#13;
&#13;
In order to prevent excessive risk concentration, MIGA sets exposure limits per country and per project. MIGA uses an economic Capital model to&#13;
evaluate concentration risk in MIGA's guarantee portfolio and to support decision making in pricing new large projects, or new projects in countries&#13;
with large exposure. Its reinsurance program, including treaty and facultative reinsurance, helps manage the risk profile of the portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          FiNANciAl stAtEMENts MIGA AnnuAl RepoRt 09                              |   101&#13;
&amp;#12;          credit Risk Counter-party credit risk in MIGA's portfolio is the risk that reinsurers would fail to pay their share of a claim. MIGA requires that private&#13;
          sector reinsurers, with which it conducts business, be rated by at least two of the four major rating agencies (standard &amp; poor's, A.M. Best, Moody's&#13;
          and Fitch), and that the ratings be above a minimum threshold. Also, MIGA has established limits at both the project and portfolio levels, which restrict&#13;
          the amount of reinsurance.&#13;
&#13;
          At present MIGA's investment portfolio does not have any significant credit risk exposure. MIGA currently invests in fixed income securities with high&#13;
          credit quality. the Investment Authorization stipulates that government or agency sponsored debt securities be AA-rated or above, time deposits be&#13;
          A-rated or above, and corporate debt securities be AAA-rated.&#13;
&#13;
          interest Rate Risk Interest rate changes affect the market values of MIGA's invested assets. A need to liquidate assets to pay for claims in an unfa-&#13;
          vorable interest rate environment may generate trading losses and reduce investment income. Changes in interest rates will also affect prepayment&#13;
          speeds of mortgage and asset backed security holdings, which may affect the duration of the asset portfolio. A 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield&#13;
          curve could impact the net income in Fy09 by approximately $7.5 million (Fy08: $9.6 million). this interest rate sensitivity is illustrative only and is&#13;
          based on simplified scenarios. the impact of a parallel shift in interest rates is determined using market value weighted portfolio duration applied to&#13;
          invested asset balance at year end.&#13;
&#13;
          Foreign Exchange Rate Risk the majority of MIGA's assets and contingent liabilities are denominated in usD, but some guarantee contracts are&#13;
          issued in other currencies such as euR. to the extent that a claim is made in a non-usD currency and requires payment in excess of MIGA's holdings of&#13;
          that currency, MIGA may face a foreign exchange related loss in converting to the needed currency to pay for a claim. A 10 percent change in the usD/&#13;
          euro year end exchange rate could impact the net income in Fy09 by approximately $12.2 million (Fy08: $12.3 million) and net guarantee exposure&#13;
          by approximately $105.8 million (Fy08: $74.0 million). this foreign exchange rate sensitivity is illustrative only and is based on simplified scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
          Operational Risk operational risk is intrinsic to financial institutions and is an important component of the agency-wide risk management framework.&#13;
          the most important types of operational risk involve breakdowns in internal controls and corporate governance.&#13;
&#13;
          MIGA attempts to mitigate operational risks by maintaining a sound internal control system. since 2000, MIGA has adopted Committee of sponsoring&#13;
          organizations of the treadway Commission (Coso)'s integrated internal control framework, in line with IBRD/IDA and IFC, to regularly evaluate the&#13;
          effectiveness of internal control system. In addition, MIGA has introduced an operational risk management system to strengthen monitoring of the&#13;
          operational risks and controls in the financial reporting process, and the effectiveness of key controls in the financial reporting process are assessed&#13;
          through the internal quality assurance review process. In Fy08, MIGA conducted Coso Risk &amp; opportunity workshops and actions are being taken to&#13;
          address the recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
          MIGA's internal controls are regularly evaluated through independent review by the Internal Audit Department (IAD) of the World Bank Group.&#13;
          Most recently, MIGA's entity level Controls were reviewed by IAD. MIGA Management has been following up on the recommendations for further&#13;
          improvement of internal controls in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
          With regard to information technology, all MIGA Information systems and applications are hosted on the IBRD technology infrastructure that is con-&#13;
          figured and adherent to the information security policy and procedures of the World Bank Group. In addition, increased collaboration with the World&#13;
          Bank Group has allowed MIGA to gain access to a larger pool of specialized skill sets to support its information systems. MIGA's client relationship&#13;
          management system (MIGA CRM) is fully integrated with the Agency's core financial system (Guarantee Database). Its content is reviewed and verified&#13;
          against an external Anti-Money laundering (AMl) and Combating the Financing of terrorism (CFt) database service. In addition, MIGA is currently&#13;
          undergoing a redesign of its core information system for managing and reporting data for activities supporting the guarantee process and its migration&#13;
          to a more robust sAp-based platform. the replacement system will allow for a more efficient and reliable database functionality to manage all key&#13;
          guarantee data, and enable the entire underwriting process to be done online. this is intended to be more efficient and to enhance the quality and the&#13;
          ability to share information internally and externally with the World Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
          For business continuity, MIGA's corporate web services have now been added to MIGA's information systems already hosted at the World Bank Group's&#13;
          Business Continuity Center. In addition, MIGA departments have further documented their business processes required to support the Agency's effort&#13;
          to re-establish basic operations following a crisis. For data security, more robust reporting functions and security monitoring have been implemented&#13;
          to further enhance MIGA's information security&#13;
&#13;
          legal Risk legal risks arise primarily from changes in the legal parameters of MIGA's member countries as a result of legislation or court decisions&#13;
          that may affect MIGA's activities. there are also legal risks associated with MIGA being involved in legal disputes and arbitration proceedings, especially&#13;
          in the context of claim resolution or settlement.&#13;
&#13;
          MIGA manages these risks by monitoring current and prospective future developments by way of ongoing discussions with member countries' rep-&#13;
          resentatives on the Board of Directors and Council of Governors. MIGA also shares information and analyses with other members of the World Bank&#13;
          Group, the IMF and the united nations. In addition, MIGA actively participates as a member of the Berne union in discussions and analyses of the&#13;
          changes in the operating investment environment in its member countries.&#13;
&#13;
          Economic Capital and Portfolio Risk Modeling&#13;
          For portfolio risk management purposes, MIGA currently utilizes an economic Capital Model, based on the latent factor model of the Merton&#13;
          framework in credit risk modeling. the economic Capital (eC) concept is a widely recognized risk management tool in the banking and insurance&#13;
          industries, defining the amount of capital an organization needs to hold in order to sustain larger than expected losses with a high degree of certainty,&#13;
          over a defined time horizon and given the risk exposure and defined risk tolerance. MIGA defines its economic capital as the 99.99th percentile of the&#13;
          aggregate loss distribution over a one year horizon, minus the mean of the loss distribution, which is in line with industry practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
102   |     MIGA AnnuAl RepoRt 09 FiNANciAl stAtEMENts&#13;
&amp;#12;the model helps evaluate concentration risk in the guarantee portfolio and facilitates active, risk-based exposure management by allocating the&#13;
economic Capital to particular regions, countries, sectors, covers, or individual contracts, based on their respective risk contribution.&#13;
&#13;
MIGA employs the eC model to manage its insurance portfolio risks as the cornerstone of its capital adequacy framework. In addition, it provides&#13;
the analytical basis for risk-based pricing of its products as well as quantification of the need for prudent technical provisions for claims and liquidity&#13;
holdings. An extensive review of MIGA's eC and pricing models was completed in the first quarter of Fy08, with the objective to validate critical&#13;
parameters and to fully integrate the two models. this helps ensure consistency between pricing, portfolio exposure management, and provisioning.&#13;
Moreover, beginning in Fy08, eC-based risk measures are combined with exposure and income information for a comprehensive portfolio overview&#13;
report prepared for MIGA management on a monthly basis.&#13;

            For Multilateral Investment Guarantee
            Agency (MIGA), the challenge this year has been promoting
            foreign direct investment (FDI) into developing countries at
            a time when investment flows are slumping. While many
            investors shied away from projects because of the difficult
            investment climate, those who have been doing business
            recognized the need for the kind of political risk
            guarantees MIGA provides. This year, MIGA provided $1.4
            billion in guarantees for a range of projects, down from the
            agency's banner year of $2.1 billion in guarantees in
            2008. But MIGA also experienced far fewer cancellations of
            existing coverage this year than in previous years. MIGA is
            also supporting projects to help the most vulnerable. This
            year, the agency entered into an innovative contract to
            facilitate up to $100 million of investments to small and
            medium-size enterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa, businesses
            which account for most of the continent's jobs. MIGA
            has also focused on internal changes. At a time of financial
            crisis, promoting FDI depends on moving quickly to meet the
            emerging needs of clients. This will enhance MIGA's
            operational flexibility and procedural efficiency, and
            should lead to more business while strengthening MIGA's
            position as a self-standing enterprise.
