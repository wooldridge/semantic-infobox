This project is based on the findings of a July, 1995 pre-appraisal mission comprised of S.&#13;
Lieberman (Task Manager) and F. Saadah, and an October, 1995 appraisal mission made up&#13;
of S. Lieberman, F. Saadah, N. Mattson and E. Iswandi. F. Saadah led the October, 1994&#13;
identification mission, while S. Lieberman and F. Saadah visited Indonesia in February&#13;
1995 for project preparation. During the project development, significant assistance was&#13;
provided by the following JGF-funded consultants -- K. Parker, L. Gelmon, N. Constantine,&#13;
M. Moore, C. Campbell, M. Linnan, and J. Moran -- who worked closely with the Ministry&#13;
of Health preparation team. Tracee Williams handled the processing and production of this&#13;
report in every respect. This project has been endorsed by Marianne Haug (Director).&#13;

1. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND STRATEGY&#13;
Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Indonesia&#13;
1.1    Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were a major public health concern in&#13;
Indonesia in the late colonial period and in the first several decades following&#13;
Independence. I The increasing number of cases led to the establishment in Surabaya of a&#13;
special institute within the Ministry of Health (MOH) to address STD-related issues.&#13;
This institute carried out prevention, control and research activities, including provision&#13;
of weekly penicillin injections to prostitutes working in recognized brothel complexes.2&#13;
Thanks to improved antibiotics and persistent efforts, including the mass prevention and&#13;
treatment program for brothel workers, the incidence of syphilis fell in the 1970s.&#13;
1.2    Along with the decline in incidence rates for syphilis came a lessening of interest&#13;
in and support for STD services. The central MOH budget for STD-related activities fell&#13;
sharply. Central support for the mass treatment of syphilis was terminated in 1987, and&#13;
during the 1987/88-1989/90 interval, no funds were allocated for the subdirectorate&#13;
covering STDs within the overall communicable diseases directorate. Budgetary&#13;
restrictions and shifting priorities took their toll on different aspects of the STDs&#13;
program. For example, STD surveillance and efforts eroded; there was a reduction in&#13;
research on epidemiological and clinical issues including antibiotic sensitivity and&#13;
resistance patterns; health workers' awareness of and ability to diagnose and treat STDs&#13;
were suspect; and laboratories were unprepared to test for and identify STD cases.&#13;
1.3    This situation has persisted despite growing indications that STDs are present in&#13;
high rates within large segments of the Indonesian population. Such evidence is not&#13;
comprehensive and systematic, due to the limited coverage and reliability of the existing&#13;
passive surveillance mechanism which relies on routine reports from government&#13;
hospitals, laboratories and clinics. Among other things, this system refers only to syphilis&#13;
and gonorrhea and fails to cover numerous other STDs which may be present. The&#13;
passive system is also unable to document the very large share of STD cases seen by&#13;
One study estimated that 1.5% of the population of Surabaya suffered from infectious syphilis; other&#13;
studies pointed to very high STD prevalence rates among pregnant women, soldiers and the urban&#13;
population overall.&#13;
2   Beginning in 1957, a weekly injection of 2 ml of penicillin aluminium monostearate was given to brothel&#13;
workers in Surabaya. In 1967, the amount given was increased to 3 ml since many workers were skipping&#13;
injections and not maintaining the required blood level. This program created a public impression that&#13;
regular injections were a guarantee of the good health of prostitutes (Jones, et. al., 1994)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
private practitioners and diagnosed and tested through private laboratories, or which are&#13;
self-treated, sometimes with antibiotics purchased in pharmacies.&#13;
1.4  Indonesia's sentinel surveillance mechanisms for STDs, which ideally would&#13;
include a range of special surveys, longitudinal studies and other active reporting&#13;
arrangements are also inadequate. Nevertheless, available information suggests ample&#13;
grounds for concern. The most reliable findings, based on information collected in&#13;
Surabaya in 1992 and 1993, relates to sex workers and their clients, as well as several&#13;
occupations thought to make extensive use of sex industry services and a sample of&#13;
antenatal clinic clients (Linnan and Surabaya STD Study Group, 1995). STD infection&#13;
rates were high in all of the groups surveyed. For instance, 39 percent of the 1925 sex&#13;
workers who were tested had at least one STD, and 28 percent had two or more&#13;
infections; 22 percent of the clients of sex workers had an STD; and 18 percent of the&#13;
sample (599 women) of antenatal clinic visitors had an STD. The high rates for sex&#13;
workers were consistent with findings from small surveys of prostitutes and transvestites&#13;
carried out in the same period in Jakarta and Batam. What is of special note are the high&#13;
infection rates found among groups, e.g., pregnant women visiting antenatal clinics,&#13;
truckers, sailors and construction workers, drawn from and arguably representative of the&#13;
general population not only in Surabaya but elsewhere in urban Java. Based on such&#13;
findings, the study concludes that prevalence rates for any one STD vary between two&#13;
and five percent within the sexually active population (ages 15-60).&#13;
The Advent of HIV in Indonesia&#13;
1.5   The low priority attached to STDs as public health concerns has begun to change,&#13;
largely because of the arrival in Indonesia of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#13;
which is the causative agent for the deadly Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome&#13;
(AIDS). HIV can be transmitted through blood transfusion, intravenous needle sharing,&#13;
vertical (mother-fetus and mother-child) channels, and through other means. However,&#13;
the main transmission route, accounting for over 95 percent of known cases in Indonesia&#13;
and similar proportions in most other countries, is through unprotected sexual activity.&#13;
HIV is a new, complex and dangerous STD, and as such, interactions between HIV and&#13;
other STDs are of special concern since the presence of a conventional STD can facilitate&#13;
transmission of HIV, and hasten the onset and increase the severity of the symptoms and&#13;
complications experienced by those who are HIV seropositive (Wasserheit,1991). This&#13;
link is clearest between HIV and those STDs that cause genital ulcers, e.g., chancroid and&#13;
syphilis. Other STDs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis can increase the&#13;
risk of HIV transmission as well through genital inflammation (which raises the white&#13;
blood cell count and causes microscopic cuts). On the other hand, infection with HIV is&#13;
conducive to the acquisition of other STDs, prolongs their infectiousness and makes them&#13;
more resistant to standard treatment.&#13;
1.6   HIV was first diagnosed in Indonesia in 1987, though the arrival and initial&#13;
transmission of the virus may have occurred as early as 1984. As of December 1995,&#13;
364 HIV cases had been documented through MOH's passive reporting system. Over a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
third of these individuals lived in Jakarta and adjacent urban areas with another 23&#13;
percent of the cases located elsewhere in Java and Bali. So far, HIV victims have been&#13;
identified in fifteen of the country's 27 provinces and in all of the major islands except&#13;
for Sulawesi.&#13;
1.7   However, these figures have many questionable features. For instance, the high&#13;
ratios of males to females among individuals with HIV and of AIDS victims to all HIV&#13;
cases are uncharacteristic of the epidemic in other countries and point to a significant&#13;
undercount. Similarly, the median white blood cell count for those with HIV is at the low&#13;
level typical of those who have had the disease for five or more years, while the average&#13;
age of reported HIV cases, 30.2 years, is high compared to other countries. In the HIV&#13;
epidemic elsewhere, transmission has hit mainly those in the 15-25 age interval. The&#13;
exclusion from the regular reporting system of vulnerable groups such as the military&#13;
needs be noted as well.&#13;
1.8   Also pointing to underenumeration of HIV cases are various features of the&#13;
Indonesian social and economic scene. As in neighboring countries, rapid economic&#13;
growth has brought changing employment patterns and increased migration to urban&#13;
areas and to special economic zones. Employment shifts and geographic and social&#13;
mobility have raised demand for commercial sexual services and increased exposure to&#13;
STDs and HIV. The commercial sex industry appears to be expanding, in part because of&#13;
rising tourism, but also due to heightened demand from local clients. A second risk&#13;
factor is the increased number of Indonesians who have been visiting neighboring&#13;
countries such as Thailand and Australia which are further advanced in the HIV&#13;
epidemic. A third factor may be transmission of HIV through drug use by injection.&#13;
There appears to be less intravenous drug use in Indonesia than in Thailand or Australia.3&#13;
Nevertheless, such behavior may spread HIV in some subgroups which are not covered&#13;
by existing reporting arrangements.&#13;
1.9   In short, it appears that most HIV cases are not being enumerated by existing&#13;
routine and still limited active surveillance mechanisms. Accordingly, the actual number&#13;
of Indonesians who are HIV seropositive is probably far higher than the reported figure,&#13;
though the size of the undercount cannot be determined with precision.&#13;
Some Regional Dimensions&#13;
1.10  Jakarta. The scale and imminence of the HIV epidemic very likely vary by&#13;
region. As mentioned, Jakarta accounts for a third of Indonesia's reported HIV cases.&#13;
This is not surprising since the country's capital has characteristics that heighten the&#13;
population's exposure to HIV. Jakarta's vulnerability to HIV derives from the large&#13;
inflows to the area of temporary visitors, e.g., tourists, businessmen, truckers, sailors, and&#13;
so forth; students and migrant workers; the large formal and informal industry and&#13;
A 1994 study of high risk behavior in metropolitan Surabaya concluded there were at least 2500&#13;
intravenous drug users in that metropolitan area alone (Linnan, et. al., 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
service sectors that have developed; and from the extensive and flourishing commercial&#13;
sex industry that serves the metropolitan region.&#13;
1.11   Greater Jakart with an estimated population of 9 million in 1990, includes&#13;
Jakarta itself (1990 population, 8.2 million) and the contiguous cities of Bogor, Bekasi&#13;
and Tangerang (combined 1990 population 800,000). The sexually active population in&#13;
this urban region was an estimated 5.4 million in 1990. Although exact data do not exist,&#13;
recent studies suggest there may be 20,000-40,000 individuals in this region earning&#13;
income as sex workers (Jones, et. al. 1994). The commercial sex industry caters to a&#13;
wide range of lower, middle and upper income customers, and includes a range of service&#13;
locations and considerable diversity among service providers. For instance, there are&#13;
recognized and regulated brothel complexes (lokalisasi) such as Kramat Tunggak in&#13;
Tanjung Priok in North Jakarta which are typically visited by lower and middle income&#13;
clients . In addition, there are other places where sexual transactions and activities occur&#13;
including smaller brothel complexes, massage parlors, and single unit brothel houses.&#13;
There are also numerous sites--nightclubs, discotheques, bars, hotel lobbies, beauty&#13;
salons-- which provide a venue for sexual transactions. Finally, there are many call girls&#13;
and streetwalkers working as independent operators. Sex workers vary in their provincial&#13;
origins, educational and media characteristics, access to health information and facilities&#13;
and in their bargaining position vis a vis clients.&#13;
1.12   As discussed, surveys point to very high STD infection rates among commercial&#13;
sex workers. Rapid assessments conducted as part of project preparation suggest that&#13;
some of these individuals, particularly those working in lokalisasi, are informed to some&#13;
extent about conventional STDs as an occupational hazard, and believe they know how to&#13;
prevent infections and respond to symptoms. However, the health remedies sought are&#13;
typically delayed and suboptimal, while condom use is not widely practiced by such&#13;
commercial sex workers. Awareness of STD risks and counteracting behavior were less&#13;
evident outside the lokalisasi complexes.&#13;
1.13   The high STD infection rates in Jakarta are of concern because of the associated&#13;
risks of acquiring and transmitting HIV. As with the national level total, the reported,&#13;
cumulative HIV figure for Jakarta, 118 through October 1995, appears to underestimate&#13;
substantially the actual count. The iwg-AIDS projection model was used to estimate&#13;
current and future numbers of HIV and AIDS cases in Jakarta through the year 2010.4&#13;
The realistic standard scenario explored through this model puts the number of HIV&#13;
seropositives at 2500 in 1993 and 8500 in 1995, and anticipates an increase to 42,500 in&#13;
2000, 75,500 in 2005 and 140,000 in 2010. In this projection, the number of individuals&#13;
with AIDS rises from 3800 in 2000 to 8,500 in 2005 and 17,500 in 2010.&#13;
The iwg-AIDS model determines the number infected within key subgroups and then aggregates these to&#13;
obtain population-level estimates. Needed parameters were drawn from available surveys of commercial&#13;
sex workers and through a Delphian process with a panel of Indonesian experts (see Kosen and Linnan,&#13;
1994, and Annex II on Economic Analysis of AIDS Expenditures). The estimates reported here were&#13;
derived by Dr. M. Linnan, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta.&#13;

1.14  Riau province. Another area of concern comprises Batam, Tanjung Pinang and&#13;
several other sites in Riau province. Batam, Tanjung Pinang, the capital city of&#13;
Kepulauan Riau (KEPRI) district, and adjacent areas in this district are part of a policy-&#13;
stimulated growth triangle which also includes Singapore and Johore in Malaysia.&#13;
Batam's population grew from 6000 in 1973 to 168,000 in 1995 and is expected to&#13;
continue to rise at a rapid pace. KEPRI district has grown more slowly--its population&#13;
increased from 422,712 in 1980 to 477,700 in 1995, but is expected to expand at a&#13;
quickening pace as a result of close ties to Batam and Singapore. Pekanbaru city and&#13;
Bengkalis, Kampar and other districts have grown less rapidly, but are still vulnerable to&#13;
the epidemic.&#13;
1.15  Batam has emerged as an industrial, tourist and entertainment center. Nearly 64&#13;
percent of the labor force is employed in the different manufacturing firms which have&#13;
been attracted to the island by tax, tariff and other incentives. Women account for over&#13;
60 percent of the industrial workforce and roughly 44 percent of island's working&#13;
population. Anther part of Batam's growth is due to its hotel and tourist services. Nearly&#13;
900,000 people, many tourists from nearby Singapore, visited the island in 1994, as&#13;
compared to 60,000 in 1985 and 579,000 in 1990. During the late 1980s and early 1990s,&#13;
the sex industry expanded rapidly at Batam, thanks to restrictions in Singapore and&#13;
Malaysia and a growing inflow of relatively foreign and Indonesian businessmen,&#13;
industrial workers, sailors, and others. Currently, there are an estimated 3000 or more&#13;
women working in Batam's highly differentiated commercial sex sector.&#13;
1.16  There is a comparable concentration of entertainment services and commnercial&#13;
sex workers in KEPRI district adjacent to Batam and in reach of Singapore, Malaysia and&#13;
even Thailand. In particular, there are nine subdistricts in this district, including East and&#13;
West Tanjung Pinang, North and East Bintan. Singkep, Siantan, Moro, Karimum and&#13;
Kundur, with entertainment establishments catering to tourists, soldiers and sailors, Thai&#13;
fishermen and businessmen. There are an estimated 1500- 2000 commercial sex workers&#13;
in these areas.&#13;
1.17  The above factors have made Batam and KEPRI very susceptible to STDs and the&#13;
HIV epidemic. Local health authorities reported six HIV infected persons in Batam and&#13;
eight in KEPRI, and 29 for Riau province overall in December 1995. Of special concern&#13;
are the high turnover rates of those employed as commercial sex workers in the two areas&#13;
and as laborers in Batam's industrial estates and the large number of transient tourists,&#13;
sailors, truckers, and so forth--the region may become a site which transmits HIV to other&#13;
parts of Indonesia and Southeast Asia.&#13;
Economic and Welfare Implications&#13;
1.18  Conventional STDs can cause serious complications, and can result in chronic ill-&#13;
health and death. Typically, infections in men cause mild to severe genital and/or urinary&#13;
tract problems. Complications may include incapacitating urethral stricture, epididymitis,&#13;
infertility, neurological sequelae, cardiovascular infections, chronic liver diseases and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
cancer. The consequences for women include spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy,&#13;
tubal occlusion and other adverse reproductive outcomes; crippling pelvic inflammatory&#13;
disease; infections in infants; and hepatitic and cervical cancer. Particularly in women,&#13;
morbidity and mortality from STDs are not well defined. There may be a long latent&#13;
period before acute problems appear.&#13;
1.19   The health consequences of STDs have not been treated as high priority public&#13;
health problems in most developing countries. (As discussed, government attention to&#13;
these diseases decreased in Indonesia in the 1 970s and 1 980s.) However, recent work&#13;
has reexarnined the health impacts of STDs (Over and Piot, 1991). These studies suggest&#13;
that the burden, measured in terms of healthy days lost per capita, can be significant in&#13;
high prevalence settings, e.g., urban centers and industrial and tourist areas. Because of&#13;
these health consequences, treatment of STDs can yield significant economic benefits,&#13;
since most of those affected are of working age and also have responsibilities towards&#13;
children and aged relatives.&#13;
1.20   Moreover, establishing effective control over STDs is likely to have further&#13;
beneficial impacts by slowing transmission of HIV (please see para. 1.5). Indeed, the&#13;
benefits of averting an HIV case usually dominate those associated with reducing the&#13;
prevalence of conventional STDs. This is because HIV is far more expensive to treat&#13;
than other STDs. HIV and AIDS often entail protracted illness and numerous&#13;
opportunistic infections and other symptoms and complications which require costly&#13;
clinical or palliative interventions. In addition, the economic effects of HIV are more&#13;
serious because AIDS leads to eventual (as opposed to periodic) withdrawal from the&#13;
labor force, growing debilitation and death. All in all, the life days lost due to HIV place&#13;
this disease in the forefront of the list of incapacitating health problems. Even in low&#13;
prevalence urban centers, HIV and conventional STDs ranked eleventh among major&#13;
causes of health loss, ahead of tuberculosis, adult pneumonia and neonatal tetanus (Over&#13;
and Piot, 1991). In high prevalence urban areas, STDs including HIV account for a&#13;
substantial fraction of the entire disease burden of the population-- by itself HIV ranked&#13;
fourth in one study and moved up to third when days lost were weighted by relative&#13;
productivities.&#13;
1.21   These findings point to the potential advantages of reducing the rate and extent of&#13;
HIV transmission. These benefits may be defined in terms of the HIV-related costs to&#13;
individuals and the society which can be averted through public policy. Here, the&#13;
dominant approach in the literature distinguishes between direct and indirect costs&#13;
associated with the epidemic. The former involve various costs of treatment including&#13;
those for HIV and other tests, drugs, consultations and hospital stays. Treatment costs are&#13;
based on assumptions about the typical patterns of symptoms and complications&#13;
associated with HIV/AIDS and standard treatment protocols.5 Such cost figures are often&#13;
AIDS is usually diagnosed when a patient experiences severe weight loss, chronic diarrhea and persistent&#13;
fever, as well as some combination of recurrent coughing, dermatitis, herpes, zoster, candidiasis (in the&#13;
mouth, respiratory tract or vagina), herpes simplex infection and/or enlarged lymph glands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
underestimated because patients may consult several providers simultaneously. In&#13;
addition, there may be specific symptoms or medicines and therapies not included in the&#13;
"standard" treatment package. For example, treatments costs were estimated at&#13;
US$17,000 per HIV/AIDS patient in Brazil in 1992. This high cost reflected extensive&#13;
use of AZT to delay the onset of AIDS.6 In India where AZT and other antiretrovirals&#13;
were not generally used, the costs per AIDS patient were estimated at US$738 in 1991&#13;
(Bloom and Glied, 1992).&#13;
1.22  In Indonesia, the costs of treating AIDS were estimated for patients in Jakarta in&#13;
1995 (Annex 1, Tables 1-2). These costs were higher for those in private (US$1213-6235&#13;
per case) as compared to public (US$489-2899 per case) facilities. These estimates were&#13;
based on the costs of the drug therapies prescribed for a "typical" set of opportunistic&#13;
infections associated with AIDS. AZT and other antiretrovirals are not included in the&#13;
standard treatment regimen. Accordingly, costs per AIDS patient are well below those in&#13;
Brazil, the USA, and Europe (Scitovsky and Over, 1988), and closer to outlays in India.&#13;
Nevertheless, these costs, at roughly US$2700 per patient, are not inconsiderable. Jakarta&#13;
residents, like most urban Indonesians, have access to government and private providers.&#13;
But fewer than 10 percent of the population are covered through prepaid health insurance&#13;
arrangements including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). For this reason, the&#13;
costs of the HIV epidemic will not be shared through insurance-based mechanisms but&#13;
will be absorbed largely by affected households and the govermment budget. Higher&#13;
income patients will likely turn to private providers and hospitals while middle and lower&#13;
income patients will rely on public facilities for treatment of AIDS-related infections and&#13;
symptoms.&#13;
1.23 Several concerns need be noted here. First, as has occurred in Thailand, an&#13;
increasing number of AIDS cases may put significant pressures on the health budget and&#13;
delivery system in Jakarta. This can be seen first by considering the impact of a rising&#13;
patient load on hospital capacity. Currently, there are about 14,400 beds in Jakarta's 60&#13;
general and 33 special (including maternity) hospitals; the bed occupancy ratio is&#13;
approximately 60 percent. Using the standard projection scenario, and assuming no&#13;
increases in bed capacity, AIDS patients would account for six percent of all hospital&#13;
beds in 2005 and 13 percent in 2010. Government spending on health in Jakarta in the&#13;
early 1990s was roughly US$63 million in 1994 (US$7.5 per capita). At an assumed cost&#13;
of US$2700 per case (per year), outlays for the 8500 AIDS patients projected to be&#13;
receiving treatment in 2005 (please see para. 1.13) would account for nearly 36 percent of&#13;
current health expenditures. The fiscal burden of the epidemic would be even larger if&#13;
costs per patient were to rise, as they are likely to do if and when AZT and other&#13;
antiretrovirals are included in the standard treatment protocol.&#13;
6&#13;
In Thailand, only ten percent of new AIDS patients were reported to be using antiretrovirals in 1994.&#13;
Nevertheless, the amount spent on these drugs already accounted for thirteen percent of the AIDS budget&#13;
(Prescott, 1995)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
1.24  Secondly, significant expenses will still have to be met by affected individuals&#13;
and families, even if the government budget finances a large share of possible rising per&#13;
patient treatment costs. Cash payments in advance are normally requested for most drugs&#13;
and procedures, in public as well as private facilities. There will also be outlays for&#13;
transportation, other hospital expenses including food, over-the-counter drug purchases,&#13;
test and consultation fees and so forth. These charges will have to be covered largely&#13;
from savings, loans and/or liquidation of assets. This will be very difficult for poorer&#13;
households who as in other Asian countries likely account for a disproportionate share of&#13;
AIDS patients. AIDS may threaten the viability of such units, resulting in a lasting&#13;
impairment of poorer households' earning capacity and engendering widening income&#13;
inequality&#13;
1.25  The financial viability of affected households would be further weakened by&#13;
various output or income reductions associated witlh AIDS-related morbidity and&#13;
mortality. These income losses comprise the indirect costs of the epidemic. Again using&#13;
Jakarta as an illustration, these costs were calculated by assuming that individuals&#13;
infected with HIV forgo earnings equal to gross provincial product per adult, $3400 in&#13;
1995, from the age of onset of AIDS (assumed to be 35) to the average retirement age&#13;
(assumed to be 60). Two adjustments were made to this projected income stream. First,&#13;
per adult product in Jakarta was reduced by 20% to $2720 to reflect the likely&#13;
disproportionate representation of lower income individuals amongst AIDS patients. On&#13;
the other hand, calculations allowed for future income gains through a yearly growth&#13;
factor of 4%. No account was taken of income reductions that occur due to STD or HIV,&#13;
temporary absences from the labor market before full blown AIDS sets in, or of the losses&#13;
incurred by other family members who reduce their labor force involvement to care for a&#13;
sick relative. Finally, the flows of lost income were discounted at a rate of 8 percent.&#13;
The resulting estimate of income loss per AIDS case, $29,132, is more than ten times&#13;
larger than the estimated direct medical costs, roughly US$2700, of treating AIDS&#13;
patients.&#13;
1.26  These direct and indirect costs of AIDS are substantial on a per patient basis, and&#13;
foreshadow high aggregate costs if large numbers become infected. But these estimates&#13;
may capture only a fraction of the losses potentially associated with this disease. Mention&#13;
has already been made of a possible rise in treatment costs per patient (which may have&#13;
to be absorbed in large part by the government health system), income losses incurred by&#13;
other family members, STD and HIV-related treatment costs and income reductions, and&#13;
possible adverse implications for equity.&#13;
1.27  Moreover, the potential impact of the HIV looms even larger once account is&#13;
taken of individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid pain, discomfort, and restrictions&#13;
on non-working activities. WTP is usually estimated by using wage premiums linked to&#13;
increased mortality risks to estimate the value of a statistical life, i.e., what the society or&#13;
market are willing to pay to reduce each member's risk. In the absence of appropriate&#13;
wage or direct survey data, one approach derived rough estimates of WTP in Indonesia by&#13;
postulating a linkage with per capita, based in turn on findings for the U.S.A. (World&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
Bank, 1994). This study concluded that the implied value of a statistical life in Indonesia&#13;
fell in the US$ 75,000-175,000 interval. This range of values is 2.5-5 times the direct and&#13;
indirect costs of AIDS per case presented above.&#13;
The Government's Strategy and Key Design Issues&#13;
1.28 Overview. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has acknowledged Indonesia's&#13;
vulnerability to HIV and the negative economic effects of a possible epidemic. In the last&#13;
two years, GOI has taken a number of decisive steps to reduce the pace and extent of HIV&#13;
transmission in the country.7 A May 30, 1994 Presidential decree created a National&#13;
AIDS Commission (NAC) headed by the Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare,&#13;
with the Ministers of Health, Religious Affairs, Social Affairs and Population serving as&#13;
vice chairmen and heads of designated working groups. With support from a small&#13;
secretariat and various working groups, the NAC is expected to coordinate national&#13;
policy and program development as regards AIDS. Three specific functions for the NAC&#13;
were cited in the accompanying June 1994 Ministerial decree8: to promote or provide&#13;
technical and social services essential to the national program and which are beyond the&#13;
capacity of communities; to develop guidelines for high quality case management; and to&#13;
support the responsible involvement of community groups and NGOs in AIDS activities.&#13;
The Presidential decree also established a commission in each province, chaired by the&#13;
Governor, and involving appropriate staff from various government departments as well&#13;
as community leaders and other local stakeholders.&#13;
1.29 The June 1994 Ministerial decree identified HIV and AIDS as health problems&#13;
with significant political, economic, social, ethical and legal consequences. For that&#13;
reason, the approach taken in this decree differs from that adopted towards other health&#13;
goals, e.g., control of conventional infant diseases. First, public policy concerns extend&#13;
beyond improving service access and quality particularly for the poor, which is a&#13;
rationale for current government health interventions. Here the justification for public&#13;
involvement lies in the recognition that individuals involved in risky behavior are not&#13;
aware of the health implications of unprotected sex and drug use, and do not bear the full&#13;
costs of their actions since some consequences are shifted via infection to others and to&#13;
the health system. The goal is to urgently educate the public about the risks of&#13;
unprotected sex, to reinforce behavior which does not involve possible HIV transmission&#13;
and to change high risk behavior.&#13;
1.30   Secondly, government leadership is expected to result in a strategy involving&#13;
numerous actors and sectors, including private providers and NGOs. The potential for&#13;
such a comprehensive approach is seen in the case of Jakarta which has a large and&#13;
7As early as 1987, MOH established an AIDS Control Committtee which drew up short and medium term plans&#13;
for HIV/AIDS prevention and control.&#13;
A further Ministerial decree, issued in February 1995, provides guidelines for public and private institutions in&#13;
carrying out HIV/AIDS prevention and control programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
diverse health services sector. In 1993, there were almost 4000 doctors and over 14,000&#13;
nurses working in the city's 93 hospitals and 317 health centers, and in numerous private&#13;
clinics and residential practices. Jakarta is also well endowed with public and private&#13;
health laboratories and pharmacies whose staff and facilities can be mobilized as part of&#13;
an STDs/HIV initiative. In addition, a very high share of Jakarta's population are&#13;
reached by television, newspapers and other mass media, and also are accessible in the&#13;
workplace and in schools. Thanks to this media involvement, there is already greater&#13;
awareness of AIDS in Jakarta than elsewhere in the country. For instance, in 1994 the&#13;
Indonesian Demographic Health Survey found that 87 percent of women ever married&#13;
had heard of AIDS in Jakarta as compared to 69 percent for those living in urban Java and&#13;
38 percent for Indonesia overall. Third, there are many NGOs active in health in Jakarta.&#13;
Several of these, including Yayasan Mitra and Yayasan Kusuma Buana have initiated&#13;
small scale, HIV-related efforts which can be fine-tuned and replicated on a wider scale.&#13;
1.31  There are opportunities for a multisectoral approach in Riau as well. For instance,&#13;
Batam has the health facilities (twelve hospitals and clinics) and staff (over 50 doctors&#13;
and 90 nurses) needed to develop a strong STD program. Another advantage for policy&#13;
development purposes is the accessibility of those who work in Batam or visit the island.&#13;
Most Batam residents are employed in relative large establishments--this applies not only&#13;
to industrial laborers but also to sex workers who are either concentrated in virtual&#13;
lokalisasis or operate in well demarcated entertaimnent complexes. Tourists and&#13;
commercial visitors would also be relatively easy to reach, for example with carefully&#13;
designed health education messages and other behavioral change measures that would&#13;
form part of an HIV program.&#13;
1.32  Key design features. The Ministerial decree and subsequent policy statements&#13;
embody a commitment to a number of program guidelines. The first of these is to&#13;
strengthen surveillance. The decree acknowledged that HIV prevalence exceeds the&#13;
documented number of cases, posing problems for the design of prevention efforts and&#13;
the evaluation of pilot initiatives. This will require capacity building, and improved&#13;
coordination between the epidemiology subdirectorate within the directorate of&#13;
communicable diseases which handles routine reporting of STDs and HIV/AIDS cases,&#13;
and the communicable disease subdirectorate which is responsible for sentinel&#13;
surveillance. Another design principle is the importance accorded to targeting those who&#13;
engage in risky behavior. The decree recognized the need to reach out not only to the&#13;
general public, health care providers, and women and adolescents, but also those&#13;
individuals whose work or lifestyle put them at higher risk of being infected with HIV or&#13;
transmitting the infection. The decree also signaled an intention to rely on and empower&#13;
local bodies. The leadership, management and coordination of HIV activities were&#13;
entrusted to broadly based provincial, district and municipal AIDS Commissions. It was&#13;
felt that such entities had the potential to mobilize and utilize various community&#13;
resources (including NGOs) effectively, and to identify and reach groups with high risk&#13;
behavior. In this regard, the decree designated NGOs as full partners in the national&#13;
program. Here, reference was made to the ability of NGO staff to reach those with&#13;
special needs and interests, such as religious leaders, youth, professionals and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
The decree also cited the credibility of NGOs amongst those, such as sex workers and&#13;
drug users, who were not easily reached by government employees.&#13;
1.33  The final design imperative enumerated in the Ministerial decree was the need to&#13;
improve STD and HIV diagnosis and treatment, including preparing laboratories and&#13;
blood banks to deal with STDs and HIV. Currently, most facilities and providers are not&#13;
-prepared to deal effectively with STD patients-- rapid assessments in Jakarta and Batam&#13;
revealed low levels of knowledge among health workers about STDs with few providers&#13;
aware of the syndromic approach (please see Annex 2) or other promising diagnosis and&#13;
treatment methods. Moreover, these assessments suggested that the accessibility and&#13;
quality of STD services can be improved. Provincial health laboratories appear capable&#13;
of testing for HIV and some but not all STDs, while some private laboratories also have&#13;
adequate testing capacities. Similarly, the Red Cross has excellent testing facilities at the&#13;
central and provincial levels, and the blood supply screened there is probably free of HIV,&#13;
HBV and syphilis. But testing capacity and actual activities are uncertain in many district&#13;
laboratories and blood units. For this reason, the screening of blood units needs to be&#13;
expanded using HIV rapid testing techniques, and STD testing capacity needs to be&#13;
augmented as well. Also, the accuracy of HIV and STD tests needs to be safeguarded.&#13;
The quality of current tests is in question because of the absence of proficiency testing&#13;
and other quality assurance mechanisms.&#13;
1.34  Operationalizing the national AIDS strategy. The Presidential and Ministerial&#13;
decrees have opened the door to significant policy initiatives regarding STDs and AIDS.&#13;
Affordable and effective interventions now need to be designed and implemented.&#13;
Several challenges must be addressed in regard to operationalizing the national AIDS&#13;
strategy. First, careful and intensive pilot testing is required of alternative ways of&#13;
reaching those with STDs and delivering services to them, and of the messages and&#13;
commmunications channels that can have an impact on the behavior of targeted groups.&#13;
1.35  In addition, pilot activities need include not only trials directed at specific target&#13;
groups or service delivery mechanisms but efforts to determine how to assemble cost&#13;
effective, mutually reinforcing packages of interventions appropriate to particular&#13;
locations. What is required, in short, are pilot programs in provinces known to have&#13;
significant STD infection rates, indications of high risk behavior and a growing number&#13;
of reported HIV cases. The aim would be to bring together simultaneously and in a&#13;
unified framework all of the interventions, i.e., behavior change and service delivery&#13;
initiatives, laboratory improvements and upgraded surveillance, thought to be&#13;
indispensable in managing and preventing STDs and HIV. These comprehensive local&#13;
pilots would provide experience for program design and replication in other areas of the&#13;
country, if and when the epidemic continued.&#13;
1.36  The comprehensive local pilots would also provide a vehicle for working out&#13;
coordination and planning mechanisms and organizational arrangements governing the&#13;
different public and private stakeholders concerned with AIDS at the provincial level.&#13;
Matters to be addressed include how the local AIDS Commissions would function, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
best way to involve NGOs, and different ways of channeling funds. It would be&#13;
essential as well to use the pilot provincial programs to institute effective monitoring and&#13;
evaluation procedures and activities-- it would be pointless to invest in numerous,&#13;
possibly expensive trial initiatives if proper assessments could not be conducted. The&#13;
Ministerial decree indicates that staff and resources need to be allocated to this important&#13;
function. To this end, appropriate performance indicators need to be developed and&#13;
derived from existing or newly collected informnation, and a monitoring and evaluation&#13;
capacity and mindset will need to be established within all implementing units.&#13;
1.37 The role of MOH. Coordination of MOH's various AIDS-related activities&#13;
constitutes a second issue with a significant bearing on the operationalization of the&#13;
national AIDS strategy. The Presidential decree designated the Minister of Health as the&#13;
First Vice Chairman of the NAC, with MOH expected to play a strong technical role in&#13;
program development. To date, MOH's AIDS-related activities have been centered in the&#13;
Directorate General for Communicable Disease Control and Environmental Health&#13;
(CDC/EH) under the leadership of the Director General (DG). Within CDC/EH, the&#13;
directorates of Directly Transmitted Diseases, Epidemiology and Immunization and the&#13;
Program and Reporting Division in the DG's office have been involved. However, the&#13;
latter units are also concerned with other diseases and issues and may lack the critical&#13;
mass of skills and focus required for a timely response to STDs and HIV. In addition,&#13;
other MOH units will need tc be involved in a coordinated response to the epidemic. The&#13;
Center for Health Laboratories is crucial for surveillance and STD control, while the&#13;
Center for Health Education can contribute to the design of behavior change strategies.&#13;
The DGs for Medical Services and Public Health, who administer the country's 337&#13;
publicly owned general hospitals and 7000 health centers, will need to endorse changes in&#13;
diagnosis and treatment protocols.&#13;
1.38  Making the best use of donor assistance. The third operational issue relates to&#13;
program financing and focus. AIDS-related interventions can be costly and of long-&#13;
duration. Indonesia is fortunate that several donors have assisted the planning, policy&#13;
development and organizational activities which have taken place thus far. In particular,&#13;
WHO and USAID have supported policy work on AIDS in Indonesia since the late&#13;
1980s. In addition, USAID has made available grant money to initiate program design&#13;
and delivery in several locations. WHO has funded program development, technical&#13;
assistance and related activities relying in part on resources provided by the Global&#13;
Program on AIDS(GPA) which, however, was terminated in December 1995. In&#13;
1994/95, WHO assistance, including long term consultants within MOH, amounted to&#13;
over US$650,000.&#13;
1.39  Looking ahead, USAID and several other donors are supporting initiatives which&#13;
are larger than past AIDS-related activities in Indonesia (Annex 3). For example,&#13;
USAID's five year HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (HAPP), which began in late 1995,&#13;
will provide US$20 million in grant funds to support social marketing of condoms,&#13;
behavioral change trials and diagnosis and treatment of STDs, primarily through&#13;
demonstration activities in North Jakarta and Surabaya and a third location to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
determined later. AusAID's five year grant of US$14.5 million equivalent will fund&#13;
AIDS-related activities, primarily in Bali, NTT and Ujung Pandang. AusAID's&#13;
assistance is directed for the most part at strengthening the NAC, and supporting PACs&#13;
and some NGO activities in the three provinces. KfW's grant of US$13. 1 million&#13;
equivalent will finance private sector condom promotion and improvements in blood&#13;
safety in Surabaya, Bali and Jakarta.&#13;
1.40  Donors have been the mainstay of the limited program developed to date, and will&#13;
continue to provide a major part of AIDS funding during the next three to five years.&#13;
Still, the government has recognized that grant resources in the form made available thus&#13;
far need to be supplemented with more flexible funding, and must be programmed and&#13;
managed carefully. For example, all of the donor-funded initiatives due to start in late&#13;
1995 or 1996 incorporate a stated preference to focus on specific geographical areas and&#13;
or activities. AusAID indicated a strong interest in working in Eastern Indonesia and&#13;
operating through the NAC and PACs, USAID has insisted on channeling nearly all of&#13;
its funds through NGOs, and KfW has emphasized blood safety. Because of such strong&#13;
donor priorities, grant money has not been made available to fund a variety of training,&#13;
capacity building, institutional development and outreach activities. Yet the latter are&#13;
indispensable building blocks for a sustainable program. Second, none of the donors has&#13;
contributed a broad approach or framework through which to prioritize and coordinate&#13;
various grant-funded trials and demonstration efforts. GOI expects that comprehensive&#13;
local pilot projects in different provinces, supported by Central-level technical&#13;
assistance, will provide the missing program design and organizational framework.&#13;
Third, the introduction of funds from different sources has added to the complexity of&#13;
developing and managing a program which involves numerous units within MOH as well&#13;
as many ministries, NGOs, private parties and other stakeholders. These various&#13;
considerations relating to the involvement of different donors, each with specific&#13;
priorities and objectives, have been reflected in the design of this project (see Section 3),&#13;
and are an important element of the rationale for Bank involvement (see para. 2.7).&#13;

2. PAST AND PROSPECTIVE BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
Lessons from World Bank Projects and Other Initiatives&#13;
2.1   Health Projects in Indonesia. The Bank has funded 13 health and population&#13;
projects in Indonesia since 1977. Five of these operations are still under implementation.&#13;
The ongoing and eight completed lending operations together point to lessons that should&#13;
be incorporated in HIV/AIDS policy development in Indonesia. These include: (1)&#13;
vertical interventions with blanket approaches have only limited impact given the&#13;
diversity in health status and determinants across the country; (2) community&#13;
participation and political and religious support are indispensable in such programs; (3)&#13;
the ability of government programs to reach minority and/or hard-to-reach groups has&#13;
been limited and better collaboration with NGOs and the private sector is needed to&#13;
deliver services to such groups; (4) addressing institutional issues and building capacity&#13;
at all level is needed to ensure sustainability; (5) phased implementation can be effective&#13;
if a comprehensive package of services is provided and areas are selected to maximize&#13;
program impact; (6) monitoring and evaluation should be an integral part of each project&#13;
component; and (7) projects can be an effective tool for policy development.&#13;
2.2   HIV/AIDS Projects and Components. There are at least 40 ongoing Bank projects&#13;
with AIDS and STD components. In addition, Bank-funded AIDS operations are&#13;
underway in Zaire, India, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Kenya. One review of early&#13;
project results called on Country Departments to focus increased attention on countries,&#13;
notably those with high levels of STDs but low incidence of HIV, which still have an&#13;
opportunity to slow the epidemic (Lamboray and Elmendorf, 1992). There are other&#13;
emerging findings: (1) government programs are often unprioritized and spread too thin;&#13;
(2) the private sector and NGOs are better equipped typically than governments to reach&#13;
many communities; (3) understanding determinants of behavioral change in different&#13;
settings is crucial for prevention; (4) mass media are more effective if linked with&#13;
community and interpersonal initiatives ; (5) STD prevention and management should be&#13;
an integral part of HIV/AIDS programs; (6) operational research is often needed to&#13;
identify effective approaches; (7) good monitoring and evaluation systems should be&#13;
developed within HIV/AIDS programs; and (8) such programs usually help to strengthen&#13;
overall health policy and disease control efforts.&#13;
2.3   Yet despite these broad findings and growing experience around the world with&#13;
HIV interventions, Bank projects as well as other STD and AIDS initiatives have&#13;
provided little concrete guidance on how to design cost effective interventions of&#13;
appropriate scope. This absence of transferable lessons is surprising at first sight since&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
the literature on AIDS refers to many "success" stories, including documented reductions&#13;
in risky sexual and drug-related behavior and in STD and HIV prevalence. For example,&#13;
a Thai government program has brought increased condom use and a reduction in the&#13;
number of STD cases being treated in public clinics (Brown, et.al., 1994). Promising&#13;
reductions in risky behavior by injecting drug users and young men in general in&#13;
Thailand have also been cited (Sittirai and Brown, 1994). Another recent illustration is&#13;
the reported 42 percent reduction in HIV incidence in Tanzania as a result of improved&#13;
case management of conventional STDs in primary care facilities in rural areas&#13;
(Grosskurth, et.al., 1995).&#13;
2.4   Some cautionary principles need to be kept in view when reviewing such findings.&#13;
First, outcomes may be taken out of context or not evaluated with sufficient rigor. For&#13;
example, the study just cited noted that it was difficult to determine how much of the&#13;
reported drop in STD cases was due to shifts from government to private treatment&#13;
centers. Moreover, results often refer to limited trial initiatives--replication on a larger&#13;
scale usually introduces major complications. Here Thailand is again a good reference&#13;
point. The country's well publicized successes at the pilot stage including those just&#13;
reported do not seem to have materially altered an overall government effort which recent&#13;
observers have found to be "grossly inadequate" (Ungphakom and Sittirai, 1994). More&#13;
generally, findings and lessons appear to be context specific and culture-bound. For&#13;
example, a recurrent observation is that behavior change messages need to be provided by&#13;
credible sources and reinforced by locally reputable community figures. An implication&#13;
is that to achieve success, initiatives directed at groups practicing risky behavior in&#13;
Indonesia will have to be articulated and pursued in culturally acceptable terms.&#13;
Bank Strategy and Rationale for Involvement&#13;
2.5   The proposed project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) which was presented to the Board in February 1995. As indicated in that&#13;
document, the Bank's assistance supports the main features of Indonesia's development&#13;
strategy including enhanced human resource development, poverty reduction through&#13;
greater access of the poor to basic services and assignment of increased responsibility to&#13;
local governments in the provision of health and other services. The CAS notes that&#13;
considerable scope exists to improve the quality of health services through better resource&#13;
use. Bank-supported lending and sector work in Indonesia have addressed health service&#13;
quality by tailoring interventions to local epidemiological patterns; involving provincial&#13;
and district authorities and community members in the design and implementation of&#13;
health programs; improving availability and use of appropriate skills, drugs and&#13;
materials at the facility level; and enabling central units to concentrate on providing&#13;
technical support.&#13;
2.6   The proposed project extends this approach to the specific health circumstances&#13;
now emerging in a metropolitan region (Jakarta) and special economic zones (Batam&#13;
municipality, KEPRI district and other localities in Riau). These areas may provide a&#13;
preview of Indonesia's future. By virtue of rapid urbanization and economic growth,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
nearly half of the population may be living in such settings within a decade. Health&#13;
priorities in Jakarta, as well as Batamn and Tanjung Pinang in Riau province now include&#13;
reducing the risk of transmission of HIV and STDs. This public health agenda needs to&#13;
be addressed with cost-effective interventions.&#13;
2.7   In this regard, the rationale for Bank involvement is to provide the flexible&#13;
resources and planning and coordination framework needed for the emergence of locally&#13;
grounded responses to a possible HIV epidemic. As discussed above (para. 1.40), Bank&#13;
funds, unlike most other donor resources, will be available to finance indispensable&#13;
training, capacity building, institutional development and outreach activities. In addition,&#13;
this Bank-supported initiative will introduce a broad framework, based on comprehensive&#13;
local pilot programs, and other mechanisms which will allow local and central level&#13;
activities, including those funded by different donors, to be differentiated, prioritized and&#13;
coordinated. Besides supporting comprehensive provincial projects in Jakarta and Riau&#13;
and complementary central level activities, Bank funds will assist in establishing an&#13;
HIV/AIDS and STDs Management Unit within MOH. This Central level unit will be&#13;
responsible for managing not only the Bank-supported project but all other donor assisted&#13;
AIDS interventions which involve MOH.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
3.1   The project is intended to help operationalize and implement the AIDS strategy&#13;
presented in the 1994 Presidential and Ministerial decrees. These policy&#13;
pronouncements are aimed at achieving lower STD and HIV incidence and fewer deaths&#13;
from AIDS in Indonesia, and the aim of this "first phase" project is to use intensive pilot&#13;
efforts to develop institutional mechanisms and interventions capable of reducing&#13;
transmission of STDs and HIV in Indonesia. A core program for STD and HIV&#13;
prevention in two pilot areas would be designed and implemented in partnership with&#13;
local NGOs; extensive monitoring and evaluation would identify which trial interventions&#13;
were promising and worth continuing.&#13;
3.2   Proximate objectives and corresponding performance indicators. Due to various&#13;
measurement challenges, progress towards the ultimate goal of reducing HIV&#13;
transmission may not be discernible within the three year duration of the project. STD&#13;
and HIV incidence will be monitored through the surveillance system (see Table 3.1:&#13;
Designated performance Indicators). However, at least initially the reported number of&#13;
STD and HIV cases would be expected to rise, as an indication that a strengthened&#13;
surveillance system was functioning. For this reason, the project is designed to attain a&#13;
number of proximate objectives. These include enhancing awareness about HIV and&#13;
STD transmission and prevention strategies in specific groups; promoting behavior&#13;
change among those participating in risky sexual activities; increasing the knowldege and&#13;
skills of health providers who deal with STDs and HIV; improving the capabilities of the&#13;
health laboratory system as regards STDs and HIV; and establishing effective&#13;
surveillance mechanisms for STDs and HIV and monitoring and evaluation systems to&#13;
gauge the impact of various interventions. The corresponding performance measures will&#13;
include the proportion of sex workers in designated sites who report ever and recent&#13;
condom use; the proportion of persons in particular target groups able to describe correct&#13;
use of condoms, and where and how they most recently obtained condoms; the&#13;
proportion of trained health providers who use the syndromic approach correctly; the&#13;
proportion of STD patients who sought care with 24 hours of noticing symptoms;&#13;
reported condom use and HIV and STD incidence and the scores achieved by different&#13;
laboratories in competency reviews and proficiency panels. Baseline values for these&#13;
indicators will be estimated during the first six months of implementation, and reasonable&#13;
achievement levels for years two and three of project execution will be agreed with the&#13;
government and then reviewed by Bank supervision missions. Various process and&#13;
output indicators will be used to assess the effectiveness of each of the many trials&#13;
included in the project (para. 3.27 and Annex 4).&#13;

3.3   Strategic alternatives. The approach developed in this project was selected over&#13;
several potential alternatives, based on criteria such as the possible dynamics of disease&#13;
transmission, the availability of grant funds to support specified activities, and the likely&#13;
efficacy of government staff and services. One of these alternative options was not to&#13;
introduce, at least in the near term, specific measures which respond to STDs and the&#13;
onset of a possible HIV epidemic. Instead, existing public and private facilities would be&#13;
expected to handle STD and AIDS patients as they presented themselves for treatment.&#13;
This alternative was rejected because there is clear evidence that the HIV infection is&#13;
spreading within Indonesia and because of the long lead time required to change the&#13;
course of an HIV epidemic. A second option was to concentrate on specific trial&#13;
interventions and tasks, e.g., mass media messages, outreach to sex workers particular&#13;
settings, or blood safety improvements. This alternative was rejected because of&#13;
Indonesia has access to donor grant funding which is earmarked for such demonstration&#13;
activities. What has not been made available are flexible resources which can be used to&#13;
assemble and evaluate packages of pilot interventions in individual localities. Another&#13;
option would be to strengthen and rely exclusively on public sector providers and&#13;
facilities. This alternative was found to be insufficient since it is unlikely that&#13;
government workers will have the commitment and empathy required to convey&#13;
persuasive messages to those evidencing high risk behavior.&#13;
3.4   A participatory approach. During project preparation, different beneficiary&#13;
groups, e.g., commercial sex workers, truckers and doctors, were consulted through the&#13;
interviews and focus group discussions that formed part of the needs assessments&#13;
undertaken in Jakarta and Riau. This high level of interaction with target beneficiaries&#13;
and other stakeholders will continue during the implementation thanks to several project&#13;
features. NGOs with credibility among different target groups will play a large role in&#13;
planning, carrying out and evaluating different behavior change interventions. In this&#13;
respect, training and deploying peer educators and counselors, drawn from different target&#13;
groups, will be an important initiative. Finally, beneficiaries will be consulted&#13;
periodically on different aspects of implementation via focus group discussions and other&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
3.5   The project consists of provincial level components and complementary central&#13;
level activities. Provincial (including district and municipality-managed) interventions&#13;
would introduce simultaneously and in the same localities various behavior change and&#13;
service delivery measures thought likely to achieve significant outcomes. These steps&#13;
would be accompanied by intensified surveillance, monitoring and evaluation efforts and&#13;
backed by appropriate coordination, management and funding arrangements. These&#13;
comprehensive pilot initiatives are intended to put in place packages which are cost&#13;
effective and replicable elsewhere in Indonesia. Behavioral trials and other interventions&#13;
to reduce or prevent risk would typically be carried out by NGOs and would include peer&#13;
and workplace education, counseling and other measures targeted at different groups.&#13;
Service delivery efforts, which would also draw on NGO providers, would involve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
improvements in STD case diagnosis and management, antenatal syphilis and other STD&#13;
screening, condom marketing, blood screening, and infection control practices. The&#13;
relative weight and focus of the various elements in the pilot behavior change and service&#13;
delivery packages would be specified and approved by the provincial AIDS commissions.&#13;
3.6   The project will also fund various central level activities which assist in the&#13;
implementation of provincial AIDS programs. Resources will be provided to MOH for&#13;
the development of guidelines, standards and materials needed at the provincial level;&#13;
various forms of technical support to the pilot projects; strengthening surveillance and&#13;
health laboratories in preparation for the extension of the pilot initiatives to new areas;&#13;
and monitoring and evaluation and research to improve interventions and to gauge&#13;
program impacts. The project will also support needs assessments, baseline surveys and&#13;
related preparatory activities in several provinces which could be covered in a follow-up&#13;
operation. Relevant review and coordination activities of the National AIDS&#13;
Commission will be financed as well.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
3.7   Provincial Pilot Programs. Project activities and outlays in the two pilot&#13;
provinces are described below. The amounts in parentheses are base costs (see Table&#13;
4. la for a detailed breakdown).&#13;
3.8   Jakarta (US$8.8 million equivalent). The project will support behavior change,&#13;
STD service delivery, STD and HIV surveillance, laboratory strengthening, NGO&#13;
capacity building, monitoring and evaluation and management activities in the province&#13;
of Jakarta. As regards behavior change, the project will i) increase knowledge of HIV&#13;
risks within the population, while reinforcing traditional values and norms for positive&#13;
behavior, ii) enhance skills in risk reduction for those engaged in high risk behavior, and&#13;
iii) promote use of accessible, confidential and high quality STD services. Behavioral&#13;
interventions will be directed at various groups engaging in high risk behavior, health&#13;
providers and technicians, workplace and school audiences, and community&#13;
organizations. NGOs will play a key role in designing and carrying out behavioral&#13;
interventions in respect of the above groups. For the various audiences, the project will&#13;
support training of district and local trainers, counselors and peer group educators;&#13;
baseline surveys and needs assessments, focus group discussions and other forms of&#13;
message design and formative research; production (including printing) and distribution&#13;
of written educational and informational materials; and purchase and distribution of&#13;
condoms. NGOs and other entities will be contracted to develop and implement various&#13;
outreach activities including telephone "hotlines" and confidential HIV testing and&#13;
counseling services. Finally, projected pilot behavioral initiatives in North Jakarta to be&#13;
financed through the USAID-assisted HAPP project as well as possible European&#13;
Community-supported interventions will be accommodated within the above program,&#13;
once specific activities are clarified.&#13;
3.9   The project will also strengthen delivery of STD services in Jakarta by supporting&#13;
training of staff in the syndromic approach and infection control procedures. Due to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
particular features of the syndromic approach (please see para. 3.16 and Annex 2) not all&#13;
providers can be made proficient in STD case management in the first instance. Initially,&#13;
a relatively limited number of health workers will be targeted, comprising those most&#13;
likely to provide services to those engaging in risky sexual behavior. Funds will be&#13;
provided for skills need assessments; staff training; production of educational materials;&#13;
dissemination of guidelines and techniques to public and private doctors, nurses and&#13;
laboratory staff; purchase of laboratory equipment, test kits, drugs, condoms and&#13;
reagents; and dissemination of infection control and waste disposal techniques. Jakarta's&#13;
health laboratory system will be upgraded as regards STDs and HIV primarily through&#13;
purchase of equipment and materials needed to perform tests. Some retraining of public&#13;
and private laboratory staff will also be funded. Support to the blood banking and&#13;
transfusion system in Jakarta will not be included in this component as it is expected that&#13;
such activities would be financed by KfW (Annex 3).&#13;
3.10 In addition, the project will finance stepped up surveillance of HIV and STDs and&#13;
extensive monitoring and evaluation activities. The project will support collection,&#13;
testing and analysis of blood samples for a wide range of sentinel surveillance groups and&#13;
sites, as well as baseline and follow-up surveys of those providing STD services, and&#13;
women attending antenatal clinics. This will involve funding computers and other&#13;
equipment, reagents and other operating costs including supervision activities.&#13;
3.11   Finally, the project will support (i) establishment and operation of a province-&#13;
level management unit and (ii) review and coordination functions to be carried out by the&#13;
Provincial AIDS Commission.&#13;
3.12  Riau Province (US$7.3 million equivalent). The project will finance behavioral&#13;
and service delivery initiatives and associated surveillance, monitoring and evaluation,&#13;
and management activities initially in Batam and KEPRI, and later in other places in Riau&#13;
province. Behavioral interventions will be directed at health staff whose work makes&#13;
them susceptible to HIV, and at commercial sex workers, the clientele for the sex&#13;
industry, and others at risk. Comparable efforts will be made to reach secondary&#13;
audiences, e.g., employers and employees, educators and so forth. The activities to be&#13;
supported include production and distribution of educational materials; formative&#13;
research to develop effective media messages; counseling by telephone and on a person to&#13;
person basis; purchase of radio and television spots; procurement of condoms; and&#13;
training of district and local level trainers, peer group educators and counselors. An NGO&#13;
in Batam will be asked to develop and implement many of the outreach activities directed&#13;
at sex workers. In addition, Jakarta-based NGOs will be invited to initiate activities in&#13;
Batam, with proposals to be reviewed in a competitive process according to announced&#13;
criteria. For the secondary audience, the project will finance preparation and&#13;
dissemination of messages through different media workshops, needs assessments and&#13;
training of counselors, health education equipment and vehicles and so forth.&#13;
3.13  STD services will be strengthened through project support for skill needs&#13;
assessments; staff training including discussion of guidelines as regards patient&#13;
confidentiality and notification; dissemination of educational materials, standard&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
procedures and new techniques to doctors and other health care and laboratory staff; and&#13;
purchase of equipment, reagents, drugs, syringes and condoms. Guidelines and&#13;
procedures for those with AIDS will be tested and made available to doctors and nurses.&#13;
In existing blood transfusion units, blood banking and screening will be improved&#13;
through support for training of laboratory and blood bank staff, and through purchase of&#13;
equipment and reagents. In addition, the project would support renovation and equipping&#13;
of five transfusion centers together with purchase of reagents and staff training.&#13;
3.14 As in Jakarta, the project will fund intensified surveillance of STDs and HIV and&#13;
various monitoring and evaluation activities, including surveys of those providing STD&#13;
services. Sentinel surveillance will cover several categories of sex workers, their clients,&#13;
women attending antenatal clinics, and other relevant groups. The project will support&#13;
needed training as well as collection and analysis of blood samples, supervision, and&#13;
purchase of computers and other equipment, reagents and test kits.&#13;
3.15  Central activities (US$15.0 million equivalent).9 The project will support&#13;
coordination, technical assistance, media development, monitoring and education,&#13;
research and other activities carried out by central MOH units as well as review and&#13;
related functions performed by the NAC. Activity categories and outlays are described&#13;
below. The amounts in parentheses are base costs (see table 4.1 a for a detailed&#13;
breakdown).&#13;
3.16  STD svice delivery (USS 1.5 million equivalent). Reducing the incidence of&#13;
STDs is the main medical strategy used in this project to prevent HIV. The syndromic&#13;
approach has been chosen as the basis for strengthening the STD program. Successful&#13;
implementation of this strategy requires careful provider training that engenders changes&#13;
in practices regarding patients, the availability and proper use of recommended drugs and&#13;
materials, effective patient counseling and follow-up and a functioning laboratory and&#13;
referral system to back up the syndromic provider. The project will finance development&#13;
and testing of procedures relating to (i) the syndromic approach to STD case management&#13;
at the clinical level (including co-infection with tuberculosis) and though antenatal&#13;
service delivery, (ii) infection control techniques, and (iii) appropriate disposal of&#13;
infected blood products and other materials. Support will be provided for preparation and&#13;
production of training modules, research, fellowships, technical assistance, training of&#13;
trainers, and procurement of supplies, equipment and drugs. Project-funded activities&#13;
including technical assistance will be coordinated with the work program of a WHO-&#13;
financed expert on syndromic methods who will be assigned to MOH during 1996-97.&#13;
3.17 Surveillance (US$2.9 million equivalent!. The phased strengthening of STD&#13;
services will need to be based on an effective local surveillance system. The project will&#13;
focus initially on STD and HIV/AIDS surveillance activities in Jakarta and Riau, and&#13;
then in the second and third years of the project on strengthening surveillance in 65-70&#13;
other districts. Current STD surveillance will be changed to reflect the syndromic&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
approach and a sentinel surveillance system will be established which focuses initially on&#13;
STD and HIV prevalence as well as behavior in high risk groups. The introduction of&#13;
this system will benefit from technical assistance during the first year; a WHO-funded&#13;
resident expert will also contribute to the design to be supported through this project.&#13;
Based on an assessment of experience during the first year, including a review of the&#13;
design and implementation of the system, the pace of expansion to other districts will be&#13;
determined. This expansion to other districts will also be based on epidemiological&#13;
considerations and on demonstrated regency-level capacity. The project will provide&#13;
resources for the identification of sub-populations and sentinel groups of interest and for&#13;
the development of objectives, key indicators and standard methods for each type, e.g.,&#13;
active case detection in hospitals, linked and unlinked serosurveys, and special&#13;
surveillance in selected sites, of surveillance activity. Through this sub-component,&#13;
technical support will be provided for surveillance in the pilot provinces, and also in other&#13;
provinces. Tasks and items to be funded include development of guidelines and manuals&#13;
regarding group/site selection and testing, and notification for those found to have STDs&#13;
and/or HIV; training of staff at different levels; technical assistance; study tours and&#13;
fellowships; development of a database; purchase of supplies and equipment; and&#13;
meetings and workshops. Surveillance activities will involve several sub-directorates&#13;
within the directorates for Directly Transmitted Diseases and Epidemiology as well as the&#13;
Program Planning Unit. During appraisal, agreement was reached on a program of&#13;
coordinated planning and implementation of sentinel and routine surveillance activities&#13;
within MOH and at the provincial level.&#13;
3.18   The laboratory system (US$6.0 million equivalent). The project will strengthen&#13;
Indonesia's health laboratories as regards HIV and STDs by increasing capabilities for&#13;
testing and diagnosis at different levels of the system and establishing tiered&#13;
arrangements for monitoring and training. Centers of Excellence would be established in&#13;
Jakarta, Medan, Surabaya and Ujung Pandang to serve as anchors in a system of quality&#13;
assurance. Improvements at these four sites would prepare staff and facilities to carry out&#13;
training, proficiency testing, trouble shooting and guidance roles as regards provincial&#13;
laboratories and other centers in their "catchment" areas. Provincial laboratories&#13;
throughout the country would be provided increased capacity to handle: HIV ELISA and&#13;
rapid assay tests, alternative HIV coinfirmatory approaches, culture and sensitivity testing&#13;
for gonorrhea, large scale surveillance testing and chlamydia testing. The project would&#13;
assist the national reference laboratory at Cipto Mangunkusomo hospital in establishing&#13;
the capacity to detect early HIV infections and laboratory diagnosis of AIDS. The project&#13;
would also increase accuracy and quality in most laboratories through training, provision&#13;
of educational materials, monitoring through visits and proficiency panels, and&#13;
development of standard procedures. In Jakarta (para. 3.8) and Riau (para. 3.12), as well&#13;
as in selected sites in Irian Jaya, the project would improve testing and diagnosis&#13;
capabilities not only in provincial level laboratories but in district level facilities. The&#13;
project would also make available retraining without cost and inclusion in quality&#13;
assurance prograrns to private laboratory staff. To accomplish the above, the items and&#13;
activities to be funded will include training and related costs; technical assistance;&#13;
purchase of reagents and equipment; and workshop and seminars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
3.19 Behavior change (US$3.1 million equivalent). The project would fund various&#13;
activities needed to support provincial level behavior change interventions. These would&#13;
include design of prototypes for needs assessments, preparation and pretesting of health&#13;
education materials, training of trainers and other forrns of training, technical assistance,&#13;
research, NGO capacity building, fellowships and a wide range of monitoring and&#13;
evaluation activities.&#13;
3.20  Research. As noted, the project would provide funds under different components&#13;
to support research on topics such as health provider attitudes and behavior; infection&#13;
control practices; infection patterns and health seeking behavior of those with STDs&#13;
and/or AIDS; guidelines and practices with respect to removal and disposal of&#13;
contaminated waste; the costs and cost effectiveness of behavioral and service delivery&#13;
interventions; modeling disease trends; quality of care in different facilities; the&#13;
commercial sex industry; and resistance to antibiotics used in treating STDs and the&#13;
opportunistic infections which attack those with AIDS. Prior to negotiations, agreement&#13;
was reached on the terms of reference and level of support required for research activities&#13;
to be carried out in the first year of project execution, and on the mechanisms through&#13;
which research proposals will be reviewed and funded.&#13;
3.21 Preparation areas (US$162,500 equivalent). The project would support needs&#13;
assessments, baseline surveys and other preparatory activities in areas designated for&#13;
possible follow-up STD and HIV interventions.&#13;
Project Management and Implementation&#13;
3.22  Project management, provincial level and below. The project would be executed&#13;
by local government authorities in Jakarta and Riau. In each province, the project would&#13;
be directed by the Assistant III for Social Welfare in the Regional Secretariat in his&#13;
capacity as Secretary to the Provincial AIDS Commission (PAC). The Project Manager&#13;
would be the head of the provincial office of MOH (Kakanwil). The Project Director and&#13;
Manager would be appointed by the Governor. Implementation of activities within the&#13;
health sector would be the responsibility of the head of the provincial health service&#13;
(Dinas), with technical support in health the responsibility of the Kakanwil. A key role&#13;
would be played by the PAC. This body is chaired by the Governor with members drawn&#13;
from government departments and NGOs. The PAC would set program priorities and&#13;
directions, coordinate interventions and management review results. The Project Director&#13;
and Manager and the PAC would be supported by an implementation unit (PIU) located&#13;
in the Dinas, tasked with carrying out program priorities agreed to by the PAC, tracking&#13;
activities and expenditures, and monitoring and evaluating various behavior change and&#13;
service delivery initiatives. The PIU would be headed by a unit Chief, and supported by&#13;
an Executive Secretary and other staff. At the district level, the bupati (chief district&#13;
official) or wali kota (mayor) will have overall responsibility for implementation.&#13;
District level health activities would be delegated to the head of the district or municipal&#13;
health office, while activities outside the health sector would be the responsibility of the&#13;
District (or Municipal) AIDS Coordinator. A PIU at the district level in Riau province&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
would be staffed by a full-time Secretary. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that the governments of Jakarta and Riau provinces will maintain provincial&#13;
Project Directors and Managers and district Project Directors until the project is&#13;
completed Detailed terms of reference covering the roles, functions and staffing of&#13;
provincial and district project implementing units were also agreed at negotiations.&#13;
3.23  Project management. central level. At the center, the project would be headed by&#13;
the Director General (DG) of Communicable Disease Control and Environmental Health&#13;
(CDC/EH). The Project Director would be advised by a Steering Committe chaired by&#13;
MOH's Secretary General, with members drawn from MOH, Bappenas, Ministry of&#13;
Finance and the Ministry of Human Affairs (Annex 5). In light of the new challenges&#13;
posed by HIV/AIDS to MOH, the project would support the establishment within&#13;
CDC/EH of a special unit, called the HIV/AIDS and STDs Program Management Unit&#13;
(PMU, see Annex 5). The head of this unit would report directly to the DG for CDC/EH.&#13;
The unit would be responsible for planning, coordinating and monitoring and evaluating&#13;
all HIV/AIDS and STD-related work within MOH, for providing technical support to&#13;
provinces and districts, and for facilitating MOH's links with and support for the NAC.&#13;
In addition to the Bank-supported project, the unit would also be responsible for all other&#13;
donor assisted activities in MOH related to STDs and HIV/AIDS. This unit would consist&#13;
of technical support, planning, monitoring and evaluation, and administration subunits.&#13;
Staff in the unit would be appointed, hired or seconded from other units in MOH, and&#13;
would include individuals with expertise on surveillance, NGOs, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, and information and communications. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that the government will maintain within MOH a Project Director who shall be&#13;
the Director General of Communicable Diseases and Environmental Health, a Project&#13;
Manager who shall be responsible for day-to-day implementation of the Project, and an&#13;
HIVIA IDS and STDs Program Management Unit of agreed size and skill mix. The role,&#13;
functions and terms of reference of the Program Management Unit were also agreed at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
3.24  NGOs. A defining feature of the project is the role of NGOs in different aspects&#13;
of implementation. NGOs are expected to be actively involved in the deliberations and&#13;
decisions of the PACs. In addition, individual NGOs will be contracted to carry out&#13;
various behavior change, service delivery, training and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
activities as well as operational studies. For specified tasks, NGOs with known expertise&#13;
will be asked by provincial authorities to submit proposals. Funds are earmarked in the&#13;
project to procure training services and instructional materials supplied by NGOs. NGOs&#13;
will have a further option of submitting unsolicited proposals to carry out STD and&#13;
HIV/AIDS related activities including studies. An NGO grant fund of US$566,300 is&#13;
included for that purpose within the Jakarta component. Proposals will be evaluated&#13;
according to technical, management and financial criteria, with submissions to be&#13;
assessed by review panels established and managed by the PIU; these panels would&#13;
include NGO representatives. At the request of such panels, the PIU could assist in&#13;
refining promising proposals, including strengthening the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
components. In addition, the project will finance other capacity building measures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
directed at smaller NGOs some of which have strong ties to particular groups of interest.&#13;
These typically recently established NGOs may not have the experience and financial&#13;
resources needed to submit full-dress proposals and bids, and/or may not have complied&#13;
with all registration steps and procedures. Capacity building measures may include&#13;
needs assessments, financial and organizational audits, orientation and training&#13;
opportunities, quarterly review meetings between NGOs and MOH officials, technical&#13;
assistance, joint NGO-MOH training activities and workshops, seconding MOH staff to&#13;
NGOs, pairing or mentoring arrangements linking established and emerging&#13;
organizations, and endowing a larger NGO with limited grant making authority and&#13;
resources. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that the process of selecting and&#13;
coniracting with NGOs under different project components, including but not limited to&#13;
the NGO fund, will be on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank Also at&#13;
negotiations, GOlpresented guidelines and supporting legal documents defining the&#13;
mechanisms to be used within the project to ensure the fullest possible use of NGO.&#13;
3.25  Channeling of funds. Loan funds would be channeled through development&#13;
budget (DIP) allocations at the central, provincial and district levels. The central level&#13;
health DIP would be employed for various MOH units involved in the project. Money&#13;
for project activities within the health sector in Jakarta and Riau would flow through the&#13;
provincial and district health department DIPs. Funds for activities normally outside the&#13;
purview of the health department would initially be transferred through a provincial&#13;
health department DIP which would be assigned to support activities carried out by other&#13;
departments and NGOs. During the course of project implementation it is expected that&#13;
the latter arrangements will be superceded by decisions creating new mechanisms for&#13;
channeling funds to local governments.&#13;
3.26  Technical assistance. The project would support modest amounts of international&#13;
and local technical assistance, concentrated in the first eighteen months of&#13;
implementation (Annex 6). International technical expertise, estimated at 37 person&#13;
months, would be directed at the development of the syndromic diagnosis/treatment and&#13;
surveillance components, design of evaluation and research activities, and preparation of&#13;
training and quality assurance materials. Local technical assistance of 1 12 person months&#13;
would be used to elaborate training modules and supervise and assess training programs,&#13;
develop testing procedures, improve planning and management capacity in NGOs, and&#13;
carry out needs assessments and other tasks.&#13;
3.27  Performance evaluation and supervision strategy. Monitoring and evaluation have&#13;
a central place in this pilot project-- the aim of the project is to test and assess a range of&#13;
behavioral and service delivery interventions. Accordingly, monitoring and evaluation&#13;
steps were built into each activity and budget, and various input and process indicators&#13;
will be used to monitor implementation of different components (Annex 4). Moreover,&#13;
agreement was reached at negotiations on the indicators which would be used to assess&#13;
project performance (para. 3.2 and Table 3.1: Designated Performance Indicators).&#13;
Annual performance reviews and plans for the project's behavior change, service delivery&#13;
and surveillance interventions will be the key vehicles for project evaluation and&#13;
supervision. Preparation of reviews will be the responsibility of each province's PIU,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
using monitoring and evaluation data collected routinely as part of each intervention and&#13;
focusing in particular on the agreed performance indicators. The central HIV/AIDS and&#13;
STDs Program Management Unit will employ a full-time evaluation specialist, supported&#13;
by technical assistance. The evaluation specialist will be expected to develop and&#13;
disseminate a monitoring and evaluation plan, covering measurement of indicators,&#13;
generation of data and feedback for use of findings by project managers, and feeding into&#13;
the annual performance plan and midterm review. This specialist will liaise with&#13;
evaluation staff at NAC and take responsibility for overseeing evaluation of all activities&#13;
within the central component. The central specialist will also work closely, in a&#13;
technical oversight role, with evaluation staff assigned to provincial and district&#13;
management units. Evaluation personnel at those levels will develop evaluation plans for&#13;
project activities taken up in each local component. The project will also fund visits by&#13;
technical specialists with expertise in behavior change, service delivery and surveillance.&#13;
3.28  The Bank will conduct periodic reviews of project implementation and impact&#13;
whose timing will be linked to specific activities, the preparation of annual plans and the&#13;
availability of key indicators and findings. A detailed supervision plan is presented in&#13;
Annex 7.&#13;

4.2    Base of Costs Estimates. Baseline costs are estimated at October 1995 prices.&#13;
Medical and office equipment, and vehicle costs are based on current prices for similar&#13;
imported or locally available items. Costs for international and domestic consultants are&#13;
in line with recent health projects for appropriately qualified experts. Operational costs&#13;
are consistent with current government practices and recent health projects. Costs for&#13;
short-term, in-country training vary depending on the type of training being given and&#13;
location. Recurrent costs are based on standard government allowances for travel, per&#13;
diem, O&amp;M and consumable materials.&#13;
4.3    Contingency Allowances. Physical contingencies represent 5 percent and price&#13;
contingencies 8 percent of total baseline costs. Physical contingencies have been allowed&#13;
for all categories, as actual expenditures for all project components are expected to differ&#13;
from current estimates.&#13;
4.4   Foreign Exchange Costs. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$11.4&#13;
million (representing about 32 percent of total project costs) based on the following&#13;
percentages: (a) equipment--80 percent, (b) vehicles--90 percent, (c) instructional&#13;
materials-- 30 percent, (d) research and studies-- 20 percent; (e) drugs and reagents-- 80&#13;
percent, (f) international technical assistance-- 80 percent, (g) overseas fellowships-- 100&#13;
percent, (h) domestic consultants -- 5 percent; and (i) training, domestic studies, program&#13;
development expenditures, project management costs-- 10 percent.&#13;
4.5   Taxes and Duties. Identifiable taxes and duties are estimated at US$1.5 million&#13;
(Rp. 3.5 billion). These would be financed entirely by the Government of Indonesia.&#13;
Financing&#13;
4.6   The total project cost of US$35.2 million would be financed by a proposed loan of&#13;
US$24.8 million equivalent, covering 70 percent of total project costs. The Government&#13;
would finance the remaining costs of US$10.4 million equivalent from annual budget&#13;
allocations. Government outlays would amount to 26 percent of total project costs&#13;
excluding taxes (Table 4.3).&#13;
4.7   Incremental Recurrent Costs (US$ 4.6 million equivalent). Incremental recurrent&#13;
costs are for office operating costs, travel and supervision and for consumables, including&#13;
reagents for Jakarta and Riau. These account for 15 percent of total base costs and 13%&#13;
of total project costs.&#13;
4.8   Indonesia is eligible for a single currency fixed rate loan. Total borrowing by&#13;
Indonesia under the single currency loan program including this loan, is projected to&#13;
amount to at most 50 percent of the expected FY96 Bank lending program for the&#13;
country.&#13;
4.9   The Borrower has selected a single currency loan in US dollars in order to better&#13;
manage its external liabilities, in view of i) the weight of US dollars in Indonesia's&#13;
foreign exchange receipts, and ii) the current high exposure to the Japanese yen. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
choice of a fixed interest rate reflects the Borrower's preference to manage its interest rate&#13;
risk in view of its current exposure to floating rate loans.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
4.10  The loan proceeds would be used to finance procurement of goods and services&#13;
under all project components (see Table 4.4):&#13;
(a)   Equipment totaling US$3.4 million equivalent including contingencies.&#13;
Equipment will be handled by central, provincial and district levels&#13;
depending on where the goods are being delivered. Equipment contract&#13;
packages valued at or above US$200,000 equivalent would be awarded&#13;
under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, using the Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January&#13;
1995. Locally manufactured goods would be granted a 15 percent&#13;
domestic margin of preference. Contract packages valued at less than&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent and up to an aggregate amount of US$1.7 million&#13;
equivalent including taxes would be awarded through National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contract&#13;
packages valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate&#13;
limit of US$ 1.0 million equivalent including taxes, may be purchased&#13;
through national shopping on the basis of a minimum of three price&#13;
quotations.&#13;
(b)   Reagents for Central laboratories totaling US$4.3 million equivalent,&#13;
including contingencies. These materials would be purchased under&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures.&#13;
(c)   Vehicle costs totaling US$0.1 million equivalent. The government of&#13;
Indonesia considers the procurement of vehicles as reserved procurement&#13;
and therefore Bank financing would not be used to purchased vehicles.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were received that required vehicles will&#13;
be provided by the Government in accordance with an agreed upon&#13;
schedule.&#13;
(d)   Instructional materials totaling US$3.9 million equivalent including&#13;
contingencies. This would include printed manuals, guidelines, books,&#13;
teaching materials, standard medical forms, and video and media packages&#13;
procured and produced locally. Printing and other production services&#13;
would be procured through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) from&#13;
private printing firms by each provincial project managers and by the&#13;
central project managers. Already printed materials, up to an aggregate&#13;
limit of US$ 1.0 million equivalent, could be procured through national&#13;
shopping on the basis of a minimum of at least three competitive price&#13;
quotations, directly from publishers or distributors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
(e)   Consultant services, studies and research totaling about US$3.4 million&#13;
equivalent including contingencies, would be selected and contracted in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.&#13;
(f)    Grants for NGOs totaling about US$0.7 million equivalent including&#13;
contingencies. Grants from this fund will be awarded by a Review Panel&#13;
that includes NGO representatives based on technical and other&#13;
considerations. Funding would be by Competitive Selection based on&#13;
invitation and submitted proposals, and National Shopping (with at least&#13;
three quotations). At negotiations, agreement was reached on the criteria&#13;
to be used in reviewing proposals and awarding grants and on&#13;
contracting procedures.&#13;
(g)   Overseas and in-country fellowships totaling US$1.3 million equivalent,&#13;
including contingencies. Placement of candidates in foreign institutions&#13;
would be made on the basis of relevance and quality of programs offered,&#13;
cost, and prior experience, according to government procedures acceptable&#13;
to the Bank. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that plans for use&#13;
offellowship funds will be presented annually for Bank review.&#13;

contingencies, would be procured on the basis of relevance and quality of&#13;
the programs offered by government, private institutions and NGOs&#13;
according to government administrative procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
(i)   Project management totaling US$2.2 million equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies. Project management will include expenditures directly&#13;
related to the management of the project, such as travel, consumable&#13;
materials, honoraria, meetings, office supplies and operational costs, but&#13;
excludes salaries. The expenditures would follow government procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(j)    Recurrent costs totaling about US$5.2 million equivalent including&#13;
contingencies. This would cover operations and maintenance, supervision&#13;
and travel expenses, and purchase of other supplies, including reagents and&#13;
condoms for provincial centers. The recurrent costs would be financed by&#13;
the government.&#13;
Procurement Review&#13;
4.11  Review by the Bank would be as follows (see Annex 10):&#13;
(a)   On receipt from the borrower, the Bank will review (i) bidding documents&#13;
(SBD, Januarv, 1995) for goods to be awarded under ICB procedures, (ii)&#13;
letters of invitation, terms of reference and other relevant information for&#13;
consultants, to ascertain their conformity with the Bank guidelines and&#13;
standard form of contract published in June 1995, (iii) standard bidding&#13;
documents for national competitive bidding (NCB) procurement for&#13;
goods. Approved documents would be used for all future bidding.&#13;
Roughly 59 percent of goods purchased through the project will be subject&#13;
to prior review. The relatively low proportion covered by prior review is&#13;
due to the large number of contracts expected to cover small amounts;&#13;
many of these contracts will be the responsibility of district&#13;
implementation units.&#13;
(b)   All contracts for goods valued at or over US$200,000 equivalent and the&#13;
first two contracts for goods in each of the two Project provinces estimated&#13;
to cost less than the equivalent of US$200,000 would be subject to prior&#13;
review by the Bank, whereas all other contracts for goods would be&#13;
subject to post review, and the resident mission (RSI) and supervision&#13;
missions would carry out the review.&#13;
(c)   All individual consultant contracts including those for NGOs valued at or&#13;
over US$50,000 equivalent and contracts for consulting firms valued at&#13;
over US$ 100,000 equivalent would be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
All other consultant contracts would be subject to random post review.&#13;
The terms of reference and single source selection would be subject to&#13;
prior review.&#13;
(d)   Overseas fellowships would be subject to random post review by the Bank&#13;
Beginning in 1996, the plans for each year would be submitted to the Bank&#13;
for review and approval.&#13;
(e)   Beginning in 1996, central andprovincial training and workshop plans&#13;
for each year would be submitted to the Bankfor review and approval by&#13;
December 31 for the forthcoming year.&#13;

(b) consultant services (for firms) contracts valued at or more than US$ 100,000&#13;
equivalent; and (c) individual contracts valued at or more than $50,000 equivalent. All&#13;
other disbursements would be against statements of expenditure (SOE) for which relevant&#13;
documents would be retained by responsible agencies and made available for review as&#13;
requested by visiting Bank missions. To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account in an&#13;
amount of US$2.4 million would be established at Bank Indonesia. This Special Account&#13;
would be held in the name of the Director General of Budget, Ministry of Finance,&#13;
following established procedures. The Special Account would be used for all eligible&#13;
foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment to the Special Account would be made on&#13;
the monthly basis or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever&#13;
occurs first.&#13;
Accounts, Audits and Reports&#13;
4.15  MOH would establish project accounts for all project expenditures at both the&#13;
provincial and central levels, to be maintained in accordance with sound accounting&#13;
practices. Accounts for the SOEs and Special Account would be maintained separately&#13;
for annual audits. Each provincial PIU would send financial statements for all project&#13;
expenditures for each fiscal year to the Central Management Unit. The Central&#13;
Management Unit would consolidate the two provincial financial statements with the&#13;
central level financial statement and prepare a consolidated financial report. The&#13;
financial statements and consolidated financial reports would be audited by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Bank, including a separate audit opinion on SOE expenditures.&#13;
Certified copies of the financial report on the project for each Government fiscal year,&#13;
together with the auditors' statements, would be furnished to the Bank as soon as&#13;
available, but not later than six months after the end of each government fiscal year&#13;
starting September 30, 1997. MOH would also monitor progress in project&#13;
implementation and report to the Bank each semester on this progress. Within six months&#13;
after the completion of disbursement, the Ministry would submit an implementation&#13;
completion report (ICR) to the Bank.&#13;

5. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Program Goals and Potential Benefits&#13;
5.1   HIV is spreading in Indonesia, and the disease will be part of the country's health&#13;
picture for many years. However, the development and replication of effective&#13;
interventions can slow the rate of transmission and lessen significantly the cumulative&#13;
impact of HIV/AIDS and related health problems. An early, effective effort to prevent&#13;
HIV transmission would save many lives. As an illustration, the iwg-AIDS projection&#13;
model predicts 8500 new AIDS cases (deaths) in Jakarta in 2005 and 17,500 in 2010, and&#13;
cumulative figures for AIDS of 55,000 by 2005 and 123,000 by 2010 (Annex 1 1). New&#13;
and cumulative figures for HIV infections are even larger. Jakarta province would spend&#13;
US$8.8 million under the present project to slow the transmission of HIV and reduce the&#13;
number of deaths attributable to AIDS. I IAt issue is whether the likely impact of the&#13;
project in terms of deaths averted justifies the proposed level of spending.&#13;
5.2   Like other health system interventions, this operation can be assessed, with some&#13;
modifications, according to accepted principles of project analysis. Modifications are&#13;
needed because this initiative will not finance interventions, such as a dam or a bridge, of&#13;
known design specifications and inputs and predictable costs, construction and start-up&#13;
phases, and whose consequences can be estimated with some confidence. Instead, this&#13;
project will sponsor, fund and direct an entire "portfolio" of experimental measures in&#13;
the two provinces. Many of these trial activities have not been fully identified, and there&#13;
will be quite a few which fail or need to be modified extensively. Due to these features,&#13;
project analysis must take account of (i) the ultimate impacts on behavior change in key&#13;
respects and on whether there is a reduction in the number of new STD and HIV cases&#13;
(incidence) which is reported, and also (ii) how long it takes to determine which&#13;
approaches seem most promising and to assemble these into coherent, sustainable&#13;
provincial programs. Taking into account these two dimensions of efficiency, i.e.,&#13;
ultimate impacts on behavior and timely and efficient trialing and related processing&#13;
steps, various outcome scenarios can be used to identify different levels of project&#13;
achievement and associated benefits and costs.&#13;
5.3   This approach can be illustrated again using Jakarta as an example. As&#13;
mentioned, the baseline projection developed using the iwg-AIDS model predicts a&#13;
cumulative total of 55,000 AIDS cases in Jakarta by 2005 and 123,000 by 2010. The&#13;
second scenario (Annex 11, Tables 1, 2 and 5 and Figures 1-2) depicts the course of the&#13;
In addition, an estimated outlay of US$2 million under the central component would support activities in&#13;
Jakarta.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
epidemic assuming that interventions begin in January 1997 and achieve frll impact&#13;
within three years. This scenario, which results in 5000 fewer AIDS cases by 2005 and&#13;
22,500 fewer cases by 2010, is based on conservative assumptions about the impact of&#13;
the project on risky behavior. Specifically, the project is expected to result in a 25&#13;
percent reduction in the incidence of STDs and in risky sexual behavior, and a 25 percent&#13;
increase in the use of condoms. In this scenario, the present value of cumulative project-&#13;
related savings in direct treatment costs in Jakarta would amount to US$6.3 million for&#13;
2005 and US$19.2 million for 2010. There would also be substantial, cumulative indirect&#13;
economic benefits by 2005 and 2010. The net present value of the overall outlays and&#13;
benefits in this illustrative calculation amounts to US$140 million for 2005 and US$551&#13;
million for 2010. In short, the project as depicted in scenario two appears to be&#13;
economically justified. Moreover, the calculations exclude such project benefits as&#13;
reduced morbidity and death from a long neglected category of health problems, STDs.&#13;
Risks&#13;
5.4   Several risks arise in designing public policy in response to an unprecedented&#13;
health challenge like AIDS. First, the disease is complex and difficult to detect and react&#13;
to. On the one hand, the current extent and potential for rapid transmission of HIV may&#13;
have been exaggerated. For this reason, the government is well advised to invest initially&#13;
in improving surveillance and laboratory testing facilities, and in pilot projects in areas of&#13;
known incidence. On the other hand, HIV could spread so rapidly that public and private&#13;
response mechanisms prove inadequate. Here, the government's proposed steps through&#13;
the current project are also appropriate since surveillance, laboratory testing and locally&#13;
tailored, pilot initiatives will be key elements in an eventual Indonesian response, as they&#13;
have been in other settings, e.g., Australia and the USA, where some success has been&#13;
recorded in limiting transmission. A second risk relates to possible difficulties in&#13;
reaching and persuading different audiences, including groups which are not part of the&#13;
social mainstream, to modify what has hitherto been a very private aspect of behavior.&#13;
This risk includes a potentially reluctant or even critical reception from mainstream&#13;
religious leaders, and an inability to communicate with and extend program activities to&#13;
groups practicing risky behavior. This eventuality which is anticipated in GOI's broad&#13;
approach towards AIDS (and reflected in the Presidential Decree on AIDS), will be&#13;
addressed in the current project through unobtrusive coalition building, quiet persuasion&#13;
and involvement of key opinion leaders, and reliance on NGOs in reaching out to target&#13;
groups. This points to a third risk, that of overburdening small, recently forned NGOs.&#13;
This latter risk will be overcome through use of pilot initiatives, capacity building steps,&#13;
careful monitoring and evaluation and phased expansion in light of demonstrated NGO&#13;
capabilities. A fourth risk is that HIV initiatives will overwhelm GOI's policies towards&#13;
other health problems--this contingency can and should be avoided by integrating&#13;
HIV/AIDS diagnosis and treatment with high priority reproductive health and child&#13;
survival activities and with ongoing efforts to upgrade service quality in health centers&#13;
and hospitals. Moreover, this risk is more likely to eventuate if program efforts are&#13;
delayed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.5   The implications of several of the risk factors just discussed were assessed&#13;
through sensitivity analysis. Specifically, scenarios were developed in which the project&#13;
takes longer, possibly because of different risk factors cited above, to become fully&#13;
effective, and in which project impact is not only delayed but of lower magnitude (Annex&#13;
11, Tables 1,2, and 5 and Figures 1-2). Scenario three, in which the project takes five&#13;
years to become fully effective, results in 3500 averted AIDS cases by 2005 and 13,000&#13;
by 2010; taking account of direct and indirect savings (benefits, excluding those relating&#13;
to STD treatment) and outlays, the net present value of the project in this scenario is&#13;
US$96 million and US$314 million in the two years respectively. Scenario four, which&#13;
involves delayed and lessened effectiveness, results in 1000 averted AIDS cases by 2005&#13;
and 5000 averted cases by 2010. The net present value of the project in the latter case is&#13;
US$20 million by 2005 and US$114 million by 2010. In short, estimated benefits far&#13;
exceed expenditures even under assumptions of delayed and reduced project&#13;
effectiveness. The net present value of the project is also very high even when highly&#13;
conservative assumptions are made about the present extent and likely spread of HIV in&#13;
Jakarta; this eventuality corresponds to the first risk discussed above. Specifically, this&#13;
latter set of scenarios (Annex 1 1, Tables 3,4 and 6) builds in considerably lower rates of&#13;
sexual activity and casual sex. Despite such stringent and unrealistic premises, the&#13;
project appears to be economically justifiable, even when the impact of interventions is&#13;
phased in over five years and at reduced effectiveness, and when a higher (ten percent)&#13;
discount rate is used. Moreover, the project retains its economic rationale even when&#13;
direct and indirect benefits per case are reduced by 50 percent (Annex 11, Table 6).&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
5.6   Safe disposal of waste materials, including contaminated blood, bandages and&#13;
needles, generated in different facilities is always an issue in communicable disease&#13;
efforts, and of special concern as regards HIV. Accordingly, appropriate guidelines and&#13;
practices with respect to protecting patients and health workers, removing and disposing&#13;
of hazardous materials will be fostered during project implementation. Included in this&#13;
project is a study of waste disposal procedures and practices in government health&#13;
facilities. Current WHO guidelines will provide a point of departure for this study.&#13;
Implications for Women&#13;
5.7   This project addresses important health risks and problems for a vulnerable group&#13;
in Indonesian society which is largely female, commercial sex workers. The project will&#13;
also draw attention to the underreporting of HIV and STD prevalence, especially among&#13;
women, and will include initiatives to reduce transmission of HIV and STDs from brothel&#13;
clients to their wives and to improve diagnosis and treatment for infected women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
Poverty Impact&#13;
5.8   The project promises to have a small but favorable impact on the incidence of&#13;
poverty by reducing transmission of HIV to low income individuals. The poor are&#13;
especially exposed because they have less access to accurate information on the nature of&#13;
this disease, behavior which is risky, and ways of avoiding infection. Not only are low&#13;
income individuals more susceptible to HIV, their families are usually less able to absorb&#13;
the losses of income and treatment costs associated with AIDS. Indeed, poorer&#13;
households may have to liquidate assets and adopt other coping strategies, resulting in a&#13;
permanent reduction in income earning potential and a threat to the economic viability of&#13;
the unit.&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
5.9   The raison d'etre of this project is to identify cost effective and sustainable&#13;
interventions to slow transmission of HIV and STDs in Indonesia. This objective is&#13;
addressed through a number of features of project design. These include: the emphasis&#13;
on monitoring and evaluation in all components and activities; the delegation of planning,&#13;
institutional development and operational decision making in the pilot provinces to local&#13;
government officials; the assignment of responsibilities for priority setting, review of&#13;
results and coordination to local AIDS Commissions with wide representation; extensive&#13;
involvement of NGOs in all dimensions of the project; and the large share of project&#13;
expenditures allocated to one-time outlays, e.g., training, laboratory upgrading, and mass&#13;
media campaigns, which will not need to be funded at similar levels in later years. The&#13;
above aspects are conducive to the emergence by the end of the project of locally owned,&#13;
pilot-tested interventions which are affordable and sustainable.&#13;

6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1   Prior to negotiations, agreement was reached on:&#13;
(a)   a program of coordinated planning and implementation of sentinel and&#13;
passive (routine) surveillance activities within MOH (para. 3.17);&#13;
(b)   the terms of reference and level of support required for research activities&#13;
to be carried out in the first year of project execution, and on the&#13;
mechanisms through which research proposals will be reviewed and&#13;
funded (para. 3.20); and&#13;
(c)   the indicators to be used to measure performance in respect of the project's&#13;
proximate objectives (para. 3.2).&#13;
6.2   During negotiations, GOI provided assurances that:&#13;
(a)   the governments of Jakarta and Riau provinces will maintain the&#13;
provincial Project Directors and Managers and district Project Directors&#13;
until the project is completed. Detailed terms of reference covering the&#13;
roles, functions and staffing of the Project Implementing Units were also&#13;
agreed at negotiations (para. 3.22).&#13;
(b)   the government will maintain within MOH a Project Director who shall be&#13;
the Director General of Communicable Diseases and Environmental&#13;
Health, a Project Mlanager who shall be responsible for day-to-day&#13;
implementation of the Project, and a HIV/AIDS and STDs Program&#13;
Management Uniit of ag,eud size and skill mix. The role, functions and&#13;
terms of reference of the Program Management Unit were also agreed at&#13;
negotiations (para. 3.23).&#13;
(c)   the process of selecting and contracting with NGOs, including but not&#13;
limited to the NGO grant fund, will be on terms and conditions acceptable&#13;
to the Bank. Regarding the NGO grant fund, agreement was reached&#13;
during negotiations on the criteria to be used in reviewing proposals and&#13;
making grants and on contracting procedures (para. 4. 10). Also during&#13;
negotiations, GOI presented guidelines and supporting legal documents&#13;
defining the mechanisms to be used within the project to ensure the fullest&#13;
possible use of NGOs (para. 3.24).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
(d)   the vehicles required for the project will be supplied according to an&#13;
agreed schedule (para. 4.10).&#13;
(e)   beginning in 1996, central and provincial plans for training activities,&#13;
workshops and use of fellowship funds will be presented annually to the&#13;
Bank by December 31 in each year for review and approval (para. 4.11).&#13;
(f)   agreed indicators would be used to assess project performance (para. 3.2&#13;
and Table 3.1).&#13;
6.3   Subject to the above agreements, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan&#13;
of US$24.8 million to the Republic of Indonesia under the standard amortization term,&#13;
grace period and interest rate for fixed rate US dollar, single currency loans with an&#13;
expected disbursement period of three to six years.&#13;

HIVIAIDS AND STDs PREVENTION AND NIANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
THE SYNDROMIC APPROACH TO STD DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT&#13;
1.    The syndromic approach to STD diagnosis and treatment is designed to provide&#13;
STD treatment services where laboratory confirmation is neither possible nor available.&#13;
It is premised on the assumption that certain symptoms associated with STDs are the&#13;
result of a limited number of conditions, and the appropriate medications to treat those&#13;
conditions are known for a certain geographic locale. Combined with a system of partner&#13;
referral and treatment, the syndromic approach can increase access to treatment for both&#13;
symptomatic and asymptomatic STDs, reduce the duration of infectiousness and result in&#13;
a reduced prevalence of STDs in the general population.&#13;
2.    For example, urethritis in males is usually accompanied by a discharge, and in&#13;
many developing countries, the vast majority of discharges are due to gonorrhoea or&#13;
chlamydia. Therefore, if a male presents to a clinic with a urethral discharge, he is given&#13;
drugs for both gonorrhoea and chlamydia, and told to return in a week if his symptoms do&#13;
not improve. If he does return with no improvement, he is given either second-line&#13;
drugs, or referred to a specialist who will then institute a laboratory test.&#13;
3.    Through the use of procedural flow charts (algorithms), personnel at primary&#13;
health care centres are trained to recognise a small number of syndromes -- urethritis,&#13;
vaginitis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and genital ulcer, and dispense&#13;
appropriate medication. It has been shown that this approach results in the successful&#13;
treatment of most of the symptomatic STDs that present at PHC centres, with only a&#13;
minority of cases requiring referral to specialist and laboratory services.&#13;
4.    However, the syndromic approach involves more than diagnosis. Ideally, clients&#13;
who have been diagnosed with STDs should receive treatment at the same time, and there&#13;
are arguments that in order to achieve a high rate of compliance, drugs should be&#13;
available at the clinic. One dose of a drug taken under supervision at the clinic would&#13;
ensure 100% compliance, but some conditions require seven-fourteen days of antibiotics.&#13;
However, receiving at least the first dose of medication at the clinic would improve&#13;
compliance as compared to giving the client a prescription.&#13;
5.    Secondly, clients should be counselled on the importance of informing their&#13;
contacts, many of whom may be asymptomatic, and trying to convince them to come for&#13;
treatment. Besides the importance of partner referral and strategies for assisting in this,&#13;
counselling should also include messages and information about how STDs are&#13;
contracted and how to prevent them, including information on condoms and how to use&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                        ANNEX 2&#13;
6.    Therefore, the syndromic approach is more than simply a tool for diagnosis and&#13;
treatment in the absence of a laboratory, but a co-ordinated programme for diagnosis,&#13;
treatment and counselling towards partner referral and prevention. As such, it is based on&#13;
several assumptions and preconditions which complicate its implementation and add to&#13;
its expense:&#13;
7.    Knowledge about the relative prevalence of STDs in an area, the anti-microbial&#13;
sensitivity patterns, and the recommendations for first and second-line drugs. This&#13;
requires baseline research before the commencement of the programme, and also periodic&#13;
monitoring and surveillance to determine changes in anti-microbial sensitivity. It also&#13;
requires both the availability and the affordability of the recommended drugs, either at the&#13;
clinics or through local pharmacists.&#13;
8.    Health workers trained in the svndromic approach. Health workers who are&#13;
seeing clients with STDs need to be trained in the syndromic approach. A properly&#13;
designed training programme will involve training not only in the use of the flow charts&#13;
or algorithms, but also training in counselling and communication skills in order to help&#13;
health workers to transmit the desired messages and to break down their own prejudices&#13;
about people with STDs. Ideally, training should also include practical supervision at an&#13;
STD clinic, and it has been found that a four-five day training course is the necessary&#13;
minimum. Training courses must be designed to include all health workers who may see&#13;
STD clients -- doctors, nurses, medical assistants, and pharmacists (in those countries&#13;
where people tend to self-medicate and go directly to chemists when symptoms appear).&#13;
Special training courses have also been designed for supervisors in clinics where a large&#13;
volume of STDs are seen.&#13;
9.    Sufficient personnel to deal with the workload. It will be seen that a properly&#13;
implemented syndromic approach will require more time than is usually allotted to PHC&#13;
clients -- besides the time required for diagnosis and treatment (a physical examination&#13;
including an internal speculum exam for women is necessary), time is needed for&#13;
counselling. Some clinics may assign a separate person for the counselling, who may be&#13;
the same person who provides counselling messages in other areas such as family&#13;
planning and nutrition, but the introduction of the syndromic approach at a clinic that sees&#13;
a large number of STD patients will likely necessitate a change in staffing requirements.&#13;
10.   Adequate supplies and materials. Clinics where the syndromic approach is used&#13;
will need flow charts for the staff to refer to, educational posters and materials to use with&#13;
clients, condoms for distribution and demonstration purposes, medications (if the policy&#13;
is to dispense medications directly), etc.&#13;
11.   A referral system. If an STD patient has been given both the first-line and&#13;
second-line treatment with no improvement in symptoms, he/she needs to be referred to a&#13;
specialist for further examination and laboratory diagnosis of what is probably a drug-&#13;
resistant STD or another condition. PHC's or clinics should have access to these services,&#13;
either in the nearest urban centre, the district hospital, a private clinic, and so on.&#13;

HIV/AIDS AND STDs PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The basic goal of this project is to prevent the explosive, exponential growth of&#13;
the HIV/AIDS epidemic that has occurred in other countries. The primary strategy to&#13;
achieve this goal is to strengthen and expand the prevention and control of other sexually&#13;
transmitted diseases (STDs) in two geographic areas of the country with large populations&#13;
at risk. Studies have demonstrated the "synergistic" relationship between STDs and HIV.&#13;
Thus, the planned interventions against the first must include consideration of the other,&#13;
and improve control of "traditional" STDs may have a noticeable impact on the spread of&#13;
[HIV. It is apparent that an approach to HIV/STD control must involve both&#13;
multidisciplinary and multisectoral approaches, including clinical, laboratory and&#13;
educational services.&#13;
2.    As part of a three-year comprehensive pilot effort designed in the above&#13;
framework, the monitoring and evaluation component of this project is one of its most&#13;
important activities. Numerous activities will be planned and implemented in a short&#13;
time frame with multiple groups of people by numerous agencies and individuals in&#13;
different locations. The challenge to the monitoring and evaluation component will be to&#13;
quickly detect and respond to problems of implementation as well to be able to say&#13;
something about "what works" in Indonesia in STD/HIV prevention among different&#13;
groups of people and why, so that "scaling up" of activities can occur in the future.&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation should be carried out by managers at all levels of this project&#13;
(see below), at intervals sufficiently frequent to permit feedback and continuous&#13;
improvement of programns.&#13;
3.    Presented in the following paragraphs is an overview of the project's monitoring&#13;
and evaluation strategy, including designated performance indicators, how and when they&#13;
will be measured and by whom, for each of the principal components of the project.&#13;
Definitions&#13;
4.    Monitoring tracks the process of carrying out activities necessary for program&#13;
implementation. This can be accomplished through routine recording and reporting from&#13;
service delivery sites, supervisory visits, and periodic program reviews. Monitoring is an&#13;
integral part of evaluation; it is used to measure process objectives, that is, to determine if&#13;
and to what extent activities are being implemented as planned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -                          ANNEX 4&#13;
5.    Evaluation measures the progress of the program toward two types of objectives:&#13;
(1) outcome objectives which specify changes in behavior or services as a result of&#13;
project activities; and (2) impact objectives which describe expected changes in STD&#13;
incidence and prevalence, HIV incidence and so forth. Measurement, particularly of&#13;
outcome objectives, can involve clinic-based surveys of STD service providers, pre/post-&#13;
tests of participants in training courses, long-term follow-up surveys of training&#13;
participants, exit interviews of STD patients, disease and behavioral surveillance, and&#13;
cohort studies.&#13;
6.    The term evaluation also includes operational research designed to answer&#13;
questions related to interventions and services of the prograrn; for example, the relative&#13;
effectiveness of using a peer group approach compared to a mass media-oriented&#13;
approach to reach senior secondary school students or the effectiveness of two different&#13;
approaches to work place education in two similar kinds of work places.&#13;
7.    indicators are quantified measurements that can be repeated over time to track&#13;
progress toward the achievement of objectives. They are normally expressed as numbers,&#13;
proportions, percentages or rates. Impact indicators appear at first glance to have&#13;
advantages over outcome indicators because they measure directly the reductions in STD&#13;
incidence and prevalence that are the ultimate objectives of the program. However, the&#13;
utility of impact indicators in this project is limited, for example, by the short time frame.&#13;
Outcome indicators, on the other hand, are based on more reliable data (e.g., the&#13;
performance of health workers or laboratory technicians) and measure variables whose&#13;
improvement should lead to a decrease in the negative impact of STDs. For this reason,&#13;
outcome indicators appear preferable to impact indicators for the evaluation and&#13;
management of this project.&#13;
Overview of Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy&#13;
8.    Monitoring and evaluation activities will be the responsibility of all three levels of&#13;
the project:&#13;
Level 1: The central HIV/AIDS and STD Program Management Unit will have a&#13;
full-time evaluation specialist, supported by technical assistance as well as an&#13;
institutional contractor. The evaluation specialist will be responsible for&#13;
overseeing the development and dissemination of a monitoring and evaluation&#13;
plan by the contractor that will:&#13;
define overall program objectives;&#13;
formulate appropriate evaluation criteria and indicators;&#13;
identify appropriate data sources and determine how often indicators will&#13;
be measured; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                         ANNEX 4&#13;
describe a strategy for feedback and use of the data for ongoing project&#13;
management.&#13;
9.    The evaluation specialist will be responsible for explaining and developing a&#13;
commitment to the evaluation among those participating in project implementation.&#13;
Close coordination with evaluation experts at the National AIDS Commission will be&#13;
essential.&#13;
10.   The central evaluation specialist will have primary responsibility for overseeing&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of all central components of the project, including feedback&#13;
and data use.&#13;
11.   The central evaluation specialist will work closely with evaluation specialists&#13;
from Jakarta and Riau to ensure consistency between central and provincial level&#13;
evaluation plans. He/she will also help the provincial evaluation specialists by providing&#13;
guidance to evaluation planning and implementation by local implementing groups.&#13;
Level II: Each provincial project implementation unit will hire an evaluation&#13;
specialist who will serve as the key link between central project staff and&#13;
implementing agencies as concerns implementation of the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation component. She/he will be responsible for coordinating monitoring&#13;
and evaluation activities among similar groups or similar interventions involving&#13;
more than a single front-line implementing unit.&#13;
Level III: Pursuant to the pilot nature of this project and consistent with the&#13;
Ministerial decree which states that "because of the importance of monitoring and&#13;
evaluation in the strategy [for HIV/AIDS prevention] all plans of all&#13;
organizations/groups should include time, budget and staff for this purpose", all&#13;
implementing agencies will be required to undertake monitoring and evaluation&#13;
activities as part of their terms of reference for implementation of project-&#13;
supported activities. NGOs and other groups will be assisted in this task by the&#13;
provincial evaluation specialist, technical assistance consultants and appropriate&#13;
technical staff from management units.&#13;
Evaluation Contractor&#13;
12.   The comprehensive and pilot nature of this project presents important challenges&#13;
for evaluation. For this reason, the central HIV/AIDS and STDs Management Unit will&#13;
seek proposals from institutions and organizations in Indonesia with the expertise and&#13;
management capacity to provide all evaluation services require by the project. Services&#13;
would be provided by the resident experts of the institution; in some cases, specific&#13;
components of the evaluation, e.g., KABP surveys, or health provider surveys or focus&#13;
group discussions of CSWs participating in project activities, could be subcontracted to&#13;
other groups or individual consultants.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
HIV/AIDS AND STDS PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
Project Management&#13;
1.    The worldwide AIDS epidemic has only developed during the last decade.&#13;
Indonesia itself is in the early stages of the epidemic and no one is certain how fast the&#13;
epidemic will spread. Nonetheless, the potentially devastating impact of HIV/AIDS&#13;
demands an early mobilization on resources to prevent the outbreak of a large epidemic in&#13;
Indonesia. Institutional structures normally evolve over time and are not easily able to&#13;
respond sudden changes, such as the AIDS epidemic. Therefore, it is necessary to&#13;
establish functional arrangement to ensure that the MOH is able to meet the increased&#13;
demands for responsibilities and tasks involved with the HIV/AIDS. Thus, the project&#13;
will support the establishment of management arrangements which will support overall&#13;
activities of the MOH in the area of AIDS prevention and relief, as well as the activities&#13;
of the World Bank-supported project itself.&#13;
2.    Another consideration in establishing management arrangements is the National&#13;
AIDS Commission, recently established by a Presidential Degree. This commission is&#13;
under the Coordinating Ministry for People's Welfare and is responsible for coordinating&#13;
the work of all department, agencies and community organization in HIV/AIDS related&#13;
activities. This intersectoral group also has similar commissions at the provincial and&#13;
district level which are directly under local governments. The project will support the&#13;
work of these commissions and establish linkages with the health sector at all levels.&#13;
Central Level&#13;
3.    A management unit, called the Management Unit for the HIV/AIDS and STDs&#13;
Prevention and Management Program (PMU) will be established in the Ministry of&#13;
Health to guide the planning and technical support for implementing all activities related&#13;
to HIV/AIDS and STDs within the MOH. STDs has been included in this unit since the&#13;
major medical strategy to prevent HIV/AIDS in Indonesia is to reduce the incidence of&#13;
STDs. All work within the MOH will be coordinated by this unit and it will serve as the&#13;
major gateway to the other sector, by way of the National Aids Commission. The head of&#13;
this unit reports directly to the Director General of Communicable Disease Control and&#13;
Environmental Health (CDC/EH) in the ministry. The Unit has subunits for technical&#13;
support planning, monitoring and evaluation and administration.&#13;
4.    The Unit will be responsible for planning all MOH activities related to STDs and&#13;
HIV/AIDS and providing technical support for their implementation. This will include&#13;
the activities in the World Bank-supported project. However, policy and formal decision-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                         ANNEX 5&#13;
making (such as budget authorizations) will be made by officials in the formal MOH&#13;
structure. Depending on the decisions of the Director General of CDC/EH, staff within&#13;
the Directorate General may be seconded to work in this unit and report directly to the&#13;
head of the Unit. Whenever necessary, the Director General may consult with other&#13;
Directors General or the Secretary General to second staff from outside the Directorate&#13;
General for Communicable Diseases Control and Environmental Health.&#13;
5.    The Unit will also have responsibilities to other donor-assisted activities related to&#13;
STDs and HIV/AIDS which will be implemented by the MOH. The Planning,&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation subunit will be responsible for monitoring the implementation&#13;
of various donor-assisted projects and to guide the scheduling of all activities related to&#13;
these. The Technical Support subunit will work closely with all projects to ensure the&#13;
development of appropriate technical materials and to disseminate these materials to&#13;
other projects and regions which might use them. Donor agencies other than the World&#13;
Bank will be encouraged to assign staff or consultants to work in this subunit if this is&#13;
beneficial. However, all donor-supported staff and consultants assigned to this subunit&#13;
will be directly responsible to the Unit Head, who will in turn be accountable to the donor&#13;
agencies as needed.&#13;
6.    The PMU will facilitate MOH support for and communications with the National&#13;
AIDS Commission. For example, if the National AIDS Commission requests support&#13;
from the MOH to work with other sectors or to provide technical information or reports,&#13;
the unit will identify who should provide this support and to follow-up with its&#13;
implementation. If the MOH requires the involvement of other sectors or departments,&#13;
the Unit will be responsible for bringing this need to the attention of the National Aids&#13;
Commission.&#13;
(a)   Technical Support Subunit - This subunit will be responsible for&#13;
developing national STD and HIV/AIDS program protocols and materials,&#13;
as well as to provide technical support to provincial staff involved with&#13;
these programs. This will include biomedical aspects such as the case&#13;
management of STDs and HIV/AIDS patients, surveillance activities for&#13;
HIV/AIDS, diagnostic services for these diseases and universal&#13;
precautions for health workers and STDs. Because of the importance of&#13;
behavioral change in combating STDs and HIV/AIDS, the subunit will&#13;
include IEC (Information, Education and Communications) and evaluation&#13;
specialists. They will concentrate on interventions to reduce high-risk&#13;
behavior related to the spread of STDs and HIV/AIDS activities. This will&#13;
involve development of IEC materials and training materials, such as&#13;
modules and IEC materials and training materials, such as modules for&#13;
training STD counselors. Some development work will be carried out by&#13;
subunit staff, while other will be assigned to research units and&#13;
universities. This subunit will be responsible for evaluating the&#13;
effectiveness of such protocols and materials, either through consultant&#13;
services or studies. The division would be responsible for drawing up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                         ANNEX 5&#13;
terms of reference (TOR) for consultants and studies, as well as to monitor&#13;
performance in these assignments. Subunit staff will also be responsible&#13;
for providing technical support for provincial staff involved with STDs&#13;
and HIV/AIDS activities. Materials and protocols will be sent to these&#13;
staff, training will be provided as needed and there will be periodic visits&#13;
to the provinces to assess progress and assisting in solving problems with&#13;
implementation of program activities.&#13;
(b)   Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Subunit - The main&#13;
responsibilities of this subunit are to plan the smooth execution of all&#13;
activities involved with STDs and HIV/AIDS. This will start with&#13;
activities related to the national budget and activities supported by the&#13;
World Bank project. Eventually, this subunit will also be responsible for&#13;
activities supported by other donor agencies. In order to make appropriate&#13;
plans, the subunit will also monitor the implementation of existing&#13;
activities being carried out at the central level, and to compile monitoring&#13;
reports received from all provinces. If possible, this will also include&#13;
performance indicators, although formal evaluations will be carried out by&#13;
the Technical Division. This should provide a clear picture of the&#13;
implementation of overall activities related to STD and HIV/AIDS. Each&#13;
year, the subunit will be responsible for preparing the draft plan and&#13;
budget for the following year's activities at the central level, and to&#13;
compile provincial plans and budgets. As new national and donor assisted&#13;
projects are being prepared, this subunit will plan an active role in&#13;
identifying special needs and drawing up plans for the period of the&#13;
proposed project. Monitoring of activities in the province will be the&#13;
responsibility of the Provincial Health Office. However, this subunit will&#13;
prepare monitoring protocols and guidelines, help train provincial staff&#13;
and undertake periodic visits to support provincial activities.&#13;
(c)   Administrative Subunit - This section will be responsible for providing&#13;
administrative support to all staff in the PMU. This will involve the&#13;
normal administrative procedures needed to release, use and account for&#13;
expenditures by the PMU. It will also include financial monitoring to&#13;
track current expenditures and compare these to budgets. Contracts for&#13;
consultant services and studies would be drawn up and implemented by&#13;
this section. Especially for the World Bank project, the subunit would be&#13;
responsible for administrative issues involving the Bank, including&#13;
procurement, communications with the Bank and the monitoring of loan&#13;
disbursements. Some of these activities would also be allocated to&#13;
provincial and district staff, under the guidance of this subunit.&#13;
Steering Committee&#13;
7.    A Steering Committee will be established composed as follows:&#13;

Roles of the National AIDS Commission&#13;
8.    The National AIDS Commission, under the Coordinating Ministry of People's&#13;
Welfare or Menko Kesra, plays three key roles in supporting activities for HIV/AIDS&#13;
under the project:&#13;
(a)   Establishment of national policies regarding AIDS - As the AIDS&#13;
epidemic develops, there will be many issues which must be decided at the&#13;
highest levels. For example, what will happen if HIV victims are fired&#13;
from their jobs or released from health insurance coverage? Should&#13;
children with HIV be allowed to attend school? Issues such as these&#13;
involve many sectors and may require the drafting and implementation of&#13;
new laws and regulation. Decisions should only be made after&#13;
investigation of all sides of the issues and consideration of all interests.&#13;
(b)   Central coordination of various ministries and agencies involved with&#13;
HIV/AIDS - The activities of all departments and agencies should be in&#13;
line with national priorities and agreed targets. The commission should be&#13;
responsible for communicating with each sector to ensure that all work is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -                        ANNEX 5&#13;
being done, to prevent duplication of programs and to avoid conflicting&#13;
messages or programs.&#13;
(c)   Support the effective coordination of local AIDS Commissions - Actual&#13;
coordination of the implementation of HIV/AIDS related activities will be&#13;
done at the local levels under the local government. Local AIDS&#13;
commissions have been established to support this work and to encourage&#13;
various actors to work and plan together. The National AIDS Commission&#13;
should support the work of the Provincial AIDS Commissions by&#13;
providing effective training and materials (such as guidelines for preparing&#13;
provincial AIDS plans or for monitoring the work of various sectors), and&#13;
to make periodic visits to AIDS Commissions to explain national policies&#13;
and to help solve local problems related to coordination and planning.&#13;
9.    The project will strengthen the capacity of Menko Kesra in these roles and&#13;
provide funds for implementing activities involving these during the course of the project.&#13;
District or Municipal Level&#13;
10.   The implementation of interventions related to STDs and HIV/AIDS will be the&#13;
responsibility of the district or municipal level. Furthermore, since conditions and&#13;
capacities vary from region to region, the district or municipality will be responsible for&#13;
determining the specific mix of interventions in the region and to decide which institution&#13;
and individuals are responsible for implementing them.&#13;
11.   At this level, the bupati (chief district official) or wali kota (mayor) are&#13;
responsible for the overall implementation of AIDS related activities, as described in the&#13;
Presidential Decree. The mechanism for doing this is the District or Municipal AIDS&#13;
Commission headed by the bupati or wali kota. Membership of this commission consists&#13;
of all local units or agencies involved in AIDS work, along with representatives from&#13;
local NGOs.&#13;
12.   Under this project, the bupati or wali kota will have the overall responsibility for&#13;
implementation. However, in practice, he or she will delegate this authority to other local&#13;
officials. In the project, there will be two centers of delegation. First, activities fully&#13;
under the implementation of the health departments will be delegated to the Head of the&#13;
District/Municipal Health Office (Dinas Kesehatan Tingkat II or DinKes II). Funds&#13;
will be budgeted for this work through the APBN DIP in the health sector, usually&#13;
through the integrated health DIP, which has a sub-project manager at the district or&#13;
municipal level.&#13;
13.   Responsibility for implementing activities conducted by other government units,&#13;
joint activities between health and other sectors and work performed by NGOs will be&#13;
delegated to a local government official, at the discretion of the bupati or wali kota. This&#13;
person, called the District/Municipal AIDS Coordinator, will consult with key&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71-                         ANNEX 5&#13;
government or NGO officials and ensure that they have adequate funds for agreed&#13;
activities and are accountable for their performance. This official will also be responsible&#13;
for ensuring that World Bank procedures and agreement are being followed. In addition,&#13;
the District/Municipal AIDS Coordinator will use the forum of the local AIDS&#13;
Commission to report on AIDS-related activities and to promote an exchange of views&#13;
between various government agencies and NGOs.&#13;
14.   Activities will be carried out by various structural staff within the departments or&#13;
sections responsible for assigned work. During the course of the project, the&#13;
District/Municipal AID Coordinator and the Head of the District/Municipal Health&#13;
Office will hire one full-time professional and two full-time administrative staff to assist&#13;
with the functions of coordination, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. These&#13;
staff may be seconded from government units or hired on a contract basis from local&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
Provincial Level&#13;
15.   The overall role of the provincial level is to facilitate implementation of district&#13;
and municipal activities in the province. This involves planning functions (determining&#13;
where activities will be implemented and ensuring that budgets are prepared), providing&#13;
technical support to district and municipal units (training, assessment and problem&#13;
solving) and holding local units accountable for their performance (including monitoring&#13;
and supervision).&#13;
16.   The overall responsibility of the HIV/AIDS and STDs Prevention and&#13;
Management Program is with the Governor who is also the responsible official of the&#13;

MIV/AIDS AND STDs PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF AIDS EXPENDITURES&#13;
1.    This annex explains how the project benefits discussed in Chapter 5 were&#13;
calculated. This section also touches on other important dimensions of project economic&#13;
analysis, following EAP's guidelines on this topic.&#13;
2.    Estimating the number of AIDS cases: the iwg-AIDS model. Using Jakarta as an&#13;
illustration, the number of AIDS cases 10-15 years from now was estimated using the&#13;
iwg-AIDS, a deterministic model formulated by S.Seitz at the University of Illinois in&#13;
1989. The fourth revision of the iwg-AIDS model was used by M. Linnan, United States&#13;
Centers for Disease Control, in developing the projections for Indonesia which are&#13;
discussed below. Iwg-AIDS incorporates four interacting processes: demographic&#13;
(births, deaths, migration); host/virus contact (infectivity per contact, susceptibility per&#13;
contact, circumcision, and other factors bearing on risk of infection); sexual mixing&#13;
factors (marriage, divorce, rate of sexual contacts and number of partners); and modes of&#13;
infection (sexual, intravenous drug use, transfusion, and perinatal). Parameters relating to&#13;
these processes were taken from available data, or were estimated by Indonesian experts.&#13;
3.    Some of these parameters are as follows:&#13;
* Demographics: Birth, death, and migration data were drawn from the 1980&#13;
and 1990 censuses. The population is assumed to be 9 million.&#13;
*  Host/virus contact: Virus specific parameters were based on the major strains&#13;
being transmitted, which are related to those which predominate in Thailand.&#13;
The HIV "seed" used was 1000 in 1990. Infectivity and susceptibility were&#13;
based on the Thai strains. Circumcision rates were assumed to be 90%, and&#13;
condom use rates were estimated at 10% for high risk groups and below 5&#13;
percent for other groups. STD rates were set according to risk groups.&#13;
Inflammatory rates fell in the 0-12% range for sexually active adults, and&#13;
ulcerative rates were in the 0-10 % range.&#13;
*  Sexual mixing: Marriage and divorce rates were taken from the 1990 census&#13;
and cross checked with community surveys. Estimates for number of&#13;
partners, sexual contact rates, and sexual behavior specific parameters were&#13;
drawn from community surveys in urban Java and adjusted as needed by&#13;
Indonesian experts.&#13;
*  Mode of infection: all modes were built into the model; however, sexual&#13;
contact accounts for 95% of infections.&#13;
4.    Projection results. Based on the above parameters, a baseline projection was run,&#13;
which yielded the number of HIV-infected persons and number of persons with AIDS in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89-                        ANNEX 11&#13;
Jakarta at the mid-point of the year noted ( Annex 13, Tables 1 and 2, and Figure 1). The&#13;
baseline case projection was also used to observe the impact of project-related&#13;
interventions. Project impacts were introduced through various assumptions about the&#13;
phasing in of interventions and their eventual effectiveness. For example, service&#13;
interventions were assumed in scenario 2 (Annex 11, Tables 1 and 2) to be phased in&#13;
over two years, begininning in 1997, and to have achieved a 25 percent reduction in&#13;
STDs at the end of that two year span. Also in scenario two, the behavior change&#13;
interventions were assumed to take two years of piloting before becoming fully effective&#13;
and to result in a 25 percent decrease in specific risk behavior (casual sex, multiple&#13;
partners, and so forth) and a 25 percent use rate for condoms. The final effectiveness&#13;
figures were chosen in light of what has been achieved through comparable programs in&#13;
other developing countries. Scenario three assumes a five year phasing in of the project&#13;
but with the same ultimate effects as in scenario two (Annex 11, Tables 1 and 2), while&#13;
scenario four assumes a five year phasing in of the project and ultimate impacts which are&#13;
50 percent of those in scenarios two and three.&#13;
5.    Benefits--direct treatment costs. Treatment costs for AIDS patients were&#13;
estimated from data collected at Cipto Mangunkusomo Hospital in Jakarta and from&#13;
consultations with private hospitals (Annex 1). Costs included outlays on drugs, AIDS&#13;
tests, outpatient visits and hospital stays. Patients are assumed to live one year after&#13;
developing full blown AIDS. The estimated treatment cost in 1995, US$2700,&#13;
represents the arithmetic mean of costs in public and private facilities. AZT was not&#13;
included in the standard treatment regime and in the estimate of per patient costs, even&#13;
though some patients in private hospitals are being given this antiretroviral (which is&#13;
brought in from Singapore). At an 8 percent discount rate, the present value of these&#13;
costs arnounts to US$1251 per patient in 2005 and US$851 per patient in 2010; using a&#13;
10 percent discount factor these figures come to US$1041 in 2005 and US$646 in 2010.&#13;
6.    Benefits--indirect costs. The indirect costs of AIDS are assumed to be the&#13;
product lost to the economy due to the death of adults of working age. An average loss&#13;
per AIDS death of 25 years is assumed, and the provincial product per adult in Jakarta,&#13;
US$3400 in 1995, is used as the marginal product of labor. This figure is assumed to&#13;
grow at an annual rate of four percent. The estimate of per adult product is reduced by 20&#13;
percent in light of the disproportionate representation of lower income, possibly&#13;
unemployed individuals amongst those who get AIDS. Using an eight percent discount&#13;
rate, the present value of income lost for each person with AIDS in 2005 is US$29,132;&#13;
the estimate for individuals with AIDS in 2010 is US$24,118. Using a ten percent&#13;
discount rate, these figures come to US$19,840 in 2005 and US$14,990 in 2010.&#13;
7.    Project costs and benefits--net present value. The province of Jakarta will spend&#13;
US$8.8 million through this project to prevent HIV transmission, and an additional US$2&#13;
million will be spent under the central MOH budget through this project on activities in&#13;
Jakarta, resulting in overall project spending of roughly US$ 11 million. The overall&#13;
benefits attributable to the project were derived for different scenarios and discount rates (&#13;
Annex 11, Table 5); a notional rate of return was calculated for each cost and benefit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                        ANNEX 11&#13;
stream (scenario). For each scenario, the cumulative number of deaths averted was&#13;
multiplied by total direct and indirect benefits per person for 2005 and 2010. For the&#13;
second scenario and using an 8 percent discount rate, total benefits, i.e. the direct and&#13;
indirect costs which are saved, are US$327 million through 2005 and US$1.78 billion&#13;
through 2010. The net present value of the combined benefits and outlays expected in this&#13;
scenario is US$140 for 2005 and US$551 for 2010. In scenarios three and four, the net&#13;
present value of the combined benefits and outlay stream is lower. For scenario three,&#13;
these amount to US$96 for 2005 and US$314 for 2010. For scenario four, the figures are&#13;
US$20 for 2005 and US$114 for 2010. Estimated net benefits, in present value terms,&#13;
using a 10 percent discount rate are shown in Table 5. In sum and looking ahead only as&#13;
far as 2005, the net present value of the project is quite substantial even when a 10&#13;
percent discount rate is applied. This is also the case when 2010 is taken as the cut-off&#13;
point. Perhaps, an even stronger economic rationale for the project emerges when the&#13;
number of HIV cases averted under the different scenarios, e.g., 90,000-12 1,000 in 2005,&#13;
is brought into the analysis. The projected cost per averted HIV infection is&#13;
approximately US$110, and if each HIV case causes a loss on average of at least ten&#13;
discounted "disability adjusted life years," then the project is purchasing a year of healthy&#13;
life for roughly US$11. Finally, taking account of individuals' willingness to pay (WTP)&#13;
to avoid pain, discomfort, and restrictions on non-work activities provides further&#13;
justification for the project. One recent study estimated that the implied value of a&#13;
statistical life in Indonesia was in the US$75,000-175,000 interval (World Bank, 1994).&#13;
This range of values is 2.5-5 times the estimated direct and indirect benefits per case&#13;
discussed above.&#13;
8.    More conservative premises. Scenarios were also developed based on more&#13;
conservative but unrealistic assumptions about risky behavior (Tables 3,4 and 6).&#13;
Specifically, couples were assumed to be monogamous and casual sex rates were&#13;
reduced. Despite such strigent and highly optimistic premises, the net present value of&#13;
the project remains very high under different scenarios, even when the impact of&#13;
interventions is phased in over five years and at reduced effectiveness and when a higher&#13;
discount rate is used. Moreover, the project retains its economic rationale even when&#13;
direct and indirect benefits (costs) per case are reduced by 50 percent (Table 6).&#13;
Checklist of Topics for Economic Analysis&#13;
9.    Linkage to CAS and ESW. The rationale for Bank involvement in Indonesia's&#13;
health sector is set out in the February 1995 CAS. That document identifies human&#13;
resource development including health as one of the focal points for Bank assistance, and&#13;
points to quality improvements through better resource use as an important challenge&#13;
within the health sector. This project is consistent with the approach the Bank has taken&#13;
towards quality improvement in other health projects: there is a focus on local&#13;
epidemiological needs and priorities and an emphasis on involving local authorities and&#13;
NGOs in designing and implementing interventions; efforts will be made to improve&#13;
availability of skills, drugs, and other inputs and to enable central units to provide&#13;
whatever technical assistance is needed. No formal ESW has been completed on HIV in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-                           ANNEX 11&#13;
Indonesia, but the Bank has used boxes in recent Indonesia CEMs and informal notes to&#13;
sustain a dialogue with GOI about AIDS. AIDS became part of the ongoing policy&#13;
dialogue with GOI in 1992, with discussion turning increasingly to the details of program&#13;
and policy design.&#13;
10.   Analysis of alternatives. The alternatives which were reviewed and rejected&#13;
included not responding with AIDS-related policies and interventions, at least in the near&#13;
term, and relying exclusively on government staff and facilities to deliver HIV-related&#13;
services. This topic is discussed further in the SAR, para.3.3. Also of relevance is the&#13;
paucity of lessons learned from projects in other countries. Most reported successes are&#13;
for limited trial initiatives which have been affected by various contextual factors. As a&#13;
pilot effort, this project is intended to help identify and explore various alternative&#13;
approaches, thereby generating Indonesia-specific examples which can help shape&#13;
national policy.&#13;
11.   Fiscal analysis and cost recovery. The fiscal impact of this small scale pilot&#13;
project is negligible. Many of the STD-related services to be strengthened are in the&#13;
private sector where cost recovery is extensive; fees and charges are also relatively high&#13;
in public facilities. A large share of project expenditures are one-time outlays, e.g., on&#13;
training, laboratory upgrading and health education campaigns, which will not need to be&#13;
fimded at similar levels later on. Sustainability is built into the project in other ways&#13;
including the emphasis on monitoring and evaluation, and the extensive involvement of&#13;
local governments and NGOs.&#13;
12.   Benefit-cost analysis. Using a range of assumptions, project benefits under&#13;
different scenarios were estimated and compared to estimated project expenditures (see&#13;
above). Some sensitivity analysis was carried out in regard to different assumptions&#13;
about sexual behavior and for different discount rates.&#13;
13.   Institutional analysis. Institutional issues are paramount in this project. The role&#13;
allocated to NGOs stems in part from concerns that government agencies and staff would&#13;
be unable to communicate effectively with and deliver services to many of those&#13;
engaging in high risk behavior. Similarly, the differentiation of roles at different levels of&#13;
government that is a defining feature of the design reflects an assessment that central&#13;
MOH can best play a technical support function.&#13;
14.   Poverty analysis. The likely higher incidence of HIV amongst the poor is&#13;
highlighted in Chapter 1 of the SAR. The prospective poverty impacts of the project are&#13;
summarized in para. 5.8 of the SAR.&#13;
15.   Environmental analysis. The project will support a study on current waste&#13;
disposal practices and recommended alternatives.&#13;
16.   Economic performance criteria. The indicators agreed with GOI for project&#13;
peformance assessment are discussed in Chapter 3 of the SAR.&#13;

            The HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted
            Diseases (STDs) Prevention and Management Project is
            intended to help implement the AIDS strategy presented in
            the 1994 Presidential and Ministerial decrees. These policy
            pronouncements are aimed at achieving lower STD and HIV
            incidence and fewer deaths from AIDS in Indonesia, and the
            aim of this project is to use intensive pilot efforts to
            develop institutional mechanisms and interventions capable
            of reducing transmission of STDs) and HIV in Indonesia. A
            core program for STD and HIV prevention in two pilot areas
            will be designed and implemented in partnership with local
            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); extensive monitoring
            and evaluation will identify which trial interventions were
            promising and worth continuing. The project consists of
            provincial level components and complementary central level
            activities. Provincial (including district and
            municipality-managed) interventions will introduce
            simultaneously and in the same localities various behavior
            changes and service delivery measures thought likely to
            achieve significant outcomes. Behavioral trials and other
            interventions to reduce or prevent risk will typically be
            carried out by NGOs and will include peer and workplace
            education, counseling and other measures targeted at
            different groups.
