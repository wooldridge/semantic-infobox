        <abstracts>
            Some people think the best way to give
            aid is through grants. Others advocate aid embedded in
            subsidized loans. Mostly, incentive effects on donors and
            recipients are ignored in this debate. But grants and loans
            carry different incentives and in some settings can be
            complementary. Donors should offer a wider menu of options,
            including ongoing forgiveness of loans, unbundled subsidies,
            and loans combined with output-based grants. Donor agency
            staff should be rewarded for outcomes, not volume of funds
            out the door.
