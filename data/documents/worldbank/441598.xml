Pooling Water Projects to Move Beyond&#13;
Project Finance&#13;
Davlid            Many commercial banks have had little interest in water and sanitation projects not only because&#13;

credit, and high transactions costs (the legal, consulting, and financial costs of structuring). Most&#13;
projects have been financed on a limited recourse basis, that is, with project cash flows and assets&#13;
as the main security for lenders. The move from project to corporate (balance sheet) financing is&#13;
occurring in stages. Financing project debt from the sponsor company's balance sheet exposes that&#13;
company to significant risk and thus requires a strong and large balance sheet. Designed in part to&#13;
shield a company's balance sheet and improve a project's credit strength, innovative structures and&#13;
financial instruments are emerging. Ultimately, the goal is for water utilities to raise debt and&#13;
equity from capital markets on the basis of their own balance sheets, strengthened by a diversified&#13;
and stable rate-paying customer base. This Note reviews the new trends.&#13;

            To date most private sector water
            projects have been financed on a limited recourse basis,
            that is, with project cash flows and assets as the main
            security for lenders. The move from project to corporate
            (balance sheet) financing is occurring in stages. Financing
            project debt from the sponsor company's balance sheet
            exposes that company to significant risk and thus requires a
            strong and large balance sheet. Designed in part to shield a
            company's balance sheet, innovative financing
            structures and instruments are emerging. Ultimately, the
            goal is for water utilities to raise debt and equity from
            capital markets on the basis of their own balance sheets,
            strengthened by a diversified and stable rate-paying
            customer base. The authors review the new trends.
