        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Exploration for petroleum occurs on the
            basis of government-granted concessions, leases, or
            contracts whose terms and conditions are established by law
            or negotiated case by case. An important part of these
            arrangements is the fiscal terms and conditions-bonuses,
            rentals, royalties, and taxes. The author looks at fiscal
            systems around the world and draws some conclusions about
            how governments compete for exploration investment.
