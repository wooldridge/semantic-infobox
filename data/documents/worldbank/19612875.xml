                                               Foreword&#13;
&#13;
One of the major challenges before India is to provide sustainable sanitation and hygiene to its vast diverse and&#13;
growing population. The Government of India has declared its commitment towards achieving MDG goals and&#13;
universal sanitation coverage in the country by the year 2022, but with the current rural sanitation coverage&#13;
of 32.7 percent, this is a challenging task. The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has already risen&#13;
to the occasion with renewed strategies and approaches. The existing Total Sanitation Campaign has been&#13;
revamped and renamed as the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) in April 2012 by adopting community-led and&#13;
people-centered strategies with a saturation approach backed by post-achievement incentives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One of the major shifts in the approach under NBA has been to adopt a more holistic approach in addressing&#13;
issues related to sanitation. Apart from addressing the issues of building individual household toilets, community&#13;
toilets, and constructing toilets in anganwadis and schools, the Government has placed a lot of emphasis on&#13;
providing the much-needed flexibility to households to choose the sanitation technology they prefer from a&#13;
variety of options based on socio-cultural aspects, hydro geographical conditions, and economic status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Government has also streamlined steps to make available sanitation material and equipment within the&#13;
reach of the common people by providing incentives for the setting up of Production Centers and Rural Sanitary&#13;
Marts in rural areas. These Marts ensure that a variety of pans, soakages, compost pits, vermin-composting&#13;
processes, and washing platforms are made available at nominal cost to the general public. Another area that&#13;
has been accorded prime importance is the management of solid and liquid waste (SLWM), which is essential&#13;
for promoting a hygienic and healthy environment. Under the SLWM component, the Government is promoting&#13;
innovative and adaptable initiatives like compost pits, vermin composting, common and individual bio gas&#13;
plants, and low cost drainage apart from collection, segregation, and disposal of household waste at the&#13;
village level.&#13;
&#13;
These initiatives will be unsuccessful if the general public is not educated about the benefits of incorporating&#13;
safe sanitary practices and if they remain unaware of the various facilities and incentives being provided by the&#13;
Government. A comprehensive Sanitation and Hygiene Advocacy and Communication Strategy Framework&#13;
(2012-2017) has been launched by the Ministry with the objective of rolling out a number of communication&#13;
activities in a phased manner to sensitize the general public about various aspects of sanitation. An intensive&#13;

&#13;
    audio visual and radio campaign has been launched at the national level while the States and the Gram&#13;
    Panchayats have been urged to also include Interpersonal Communication and direct media activities. The&#13;
    need to broaden communication on rural sanitation and its various facets has been accepted and is being&#13;
    initiated with vigor.&#13;
&#13;
    As a part of this information dissemination approach to be able to bring about much-needed behavioral change,&#13;
    it is essential that we share stories of successes that have emerged from various States and UTs over the last&#13;
    decade. One State and 28,002 Gram Panchayats across the length and breadth of the country have been&#13;
    awarded Nirmal Gram Puraskars so far, as an acknowledgment of the significant sanitation initiatives taken&#13;
    up in their areas. Many of these GPs are shining examples of how to overcome extraordinary odds to achieve&#13;
    this status.&#13;
&#13;
    The Ministry, with the assistance of Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), has put together a second volume&#13;
    of Compendium of Best Practices on Rural Sanitation titled â&#128;&#152;Pathway to Successâ&#128;&#153;. This is in continuation&#13;
    with the first volume, titled â&#128;&#152;From Dreams to Realityâ&#128;&#153;, released in 2010. The 16 success stories documented&#13;
    in the Compendium can be lessons of great inspiration and serve as models for various Gram Panchayats,&#13;
    Districts, and States across India in overcoming hurdles and obstacles in various fields as diverse as&#13;
    Community Participation, Sustainability, Resource Mobilization, Solid and Liquid Waste Management, Program&#13;
    Implementation, IEC Practices, and Institutional Reforms.&#13;
&#13;
    I would like to place on record our deep appreciation to all the community members, grassroot sanitation&#13;
    workers, Panchayati Raj Institutions, and government officials who have been documented here for the&#13;
    wonderful work and sincere efforts they have put in to provide a clean and healthy environment and hope&#13;
    that they will continue to be role models for the NBA program.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One might cite endless legitimate excuses if Nirmal&#13;
Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) failed to bring about the&#13;
desired results in Bikaner. The district is a vast&#13;
desert terrain with an area comparable to that of&#13;
many Indian states. From district headquarters, an&#13;
officer would need a full day to visit the farthest&#13;
village in the district by car. People in these remote&#13;
villages live in dhanis surrounded by sand dunes.          prompt them to abandon the age-old practice of&#13;
Gram Panchayats in Bikaner can reach a radius              open-defecation in favor of a dignified and healthy&#13;
of up to 40 kilometers, an area comparable to that         future. It was provided by Arti Dogra, who was&#13;
of blocks in other districts. There is no dearth of        named District Collector of Bikaner in October 2012&#13;
space in which to answer natureâ&#128;&#153;s call. On the             after having served in the same capacity in Bundi,&#13;
other hand, the basic task of fetching drinking            where her efforts to run a community-led sanitation&#13;
water requires painstaking efforts on the part of          campaign in the district, under Nirmal Bharat&#13;
women, let alone lugging home water for use in             Abhiyan, were recognized at the national level. Now&#13;
toilets. A campaign to stop open-defecation in this        Bikaner district has witnessed an unprecedented&#13;
environment would seem doomed to fail.                     campaign by the name of â&#128;&#152;Banko Bikanoâ&#128;&#153; to&#13;
                                                           eliminate open-defecation completely. Moving along&#13;
Nothing is impossible for the people of Bikaner,           at an impressive pace, the campaign has already&#13;
however; after all, they have survived and                 reached important milestones toward achieving&#13;
prospered in this hostile desert environment for           Open-Defecation Free (ODF) Gram Panchayats, as&#13;
generations. A simple trigger was all it took to           shown in the graph.&#13;

The Active Role of Women&#13;
Womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment is an issue close to Arti&#13;
Dograâ&#128;&#153;s heart. The priority she placed on the&#13;
sanitation campaign is attributable in part to the&#13;
fact that it recognizes and emphasizes the dignity&#13;
of women. It was the women of Bikaner who&#13;
showed the greatest support for the Banko Bikano&#13;
campaign, turning out in large numbers for every&#13;
meeting and taking a lead role in the construction&#13;
of toilets in their respective households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Proactive Involvement of PRIs&#13;
The campaignâ&#128;&#153;s success is additionally due to the&#13;
support and guidance of elected representatives,&#13;
such as Zilla Pramukh, MLAs, Sarpanchs, as well as&#13;
leaders of all parties, irrespective of political divides.&#13;
Conceived as restoring the pride of Bikanerâ&#128;&#148;an                 Mass Communication&#13;

     The message was reinforced through mass&#13;
     media communication, with the help of major&#13;
     newspapers and TV channels in the district.&#13;
     Prominent news coverage comes almost on&#13;
     a daily basis in all the leading newspapers,&#13;
     highlighting the success stories of villages,&#13;

&#13;
     Regular Review and Monitoring&#13;
     The importance of regular review and&#13;
     monitoring cannot be overstated when running&#13;
     a campaign at scale. The District Collector,&#13;
     Zilla Pramukh, CEO, ACEO, SDMs, and BDOs&#13;
     hold regular meetings of key officers at their&#13;
     respective levels with the express purpose of&#13;
     discussing the sanitation campaign. Moreover,&#13;
     these officers visit villages on a regular basis to&#13;
     review the campaignâ&#128;&#153;s progress.&#13;

  A Total 81 GPs Became ODF in Four&#13;
  Months and Countingâ&#128;¦&#13;
  The Banko Bikano campaign is progressing at a&#13;
  rapid pace, with more and more communities&#13;
  coming forward to embrace change. Within four&#13;
  months, 81 Gram Panchayats have become ODF&#13;
  and more are pledging their commitment all the&#13;
  time. As demand for change grows exponentially,&#13;
  it has become clear that nothing is impossible for&#13;
  the Bikaner community. Surprisingly, even after&#13;
  achieving ODF, some communities are reluctant to&#13;
  approach the government to obtain the promised&#13;
  incentive. The district support unit has had to&#13;
  literally remind the communities to submit their&#13;
  applications for releasing the reward funds. People&#13;
  are using toilets not for personal gain but rather&#13;
  for the sake of their pride and dignity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Banko Bikano reminds all of us that stopping&#13;
  open-defecation throughout Rajasthan and even&#13;
  India would be quite possible, if we were ready to&#13;
  learn from Bikanerâ&#128;&#153;s success. There are no longer&#13;
  any excuses.&#13;

     The campaign was launched in Tarangar block&#13;
     with a one-day workshop led by the District        Financing&#13;
     Collector and Zilla Pramukh in November 2012.      It is widely known from the experience of&#13;
     The selection of Taranagar block as the kick-off   implementing CRSP that providing toilets alone&#13;
     site helped to provide a necessary momentum        would not ensure the desired result. The true&#13;
     for the â&#128;&#152;Chokho Churuâ&#128;&#153; campaign. Thanks to the     indicator of real and sustainable behavior change&#13;
     proactive leadership of SDM Haritima, BDOs         would be for people to construct toilets for&#13;
     Imilal Saran, and Gopiram Mehla, along with        themselves. However, the financial circumstances&#13;
     that of Pradhan Ankori Devi Kaswa, all the GPs     of poor households do not always permit this&#13;
     in the block became ODF within two months.         sort of undertaking, a fact that cannot be ignored.&#13;
     This accomplished, the campaign was extended       The district administration made every effort to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Compendium of Best Practices in Rural Sanitation in India&#13;
                                                                                                                  43&#13;

provide labor through MGNREGA and to release&#13;
NBA incentives immediately after the desired&#13;
outcomes were achieved. The available incentives&#13;
were transferred to Gram Panchayats and the GP&#13;
then transferred them directly to the bank accounts&#13;
of all eligible households that had constructed&#13;
and were using toilets. To enable this, sanctions&#13;
were completed for all eligible households before&#13;
starting the two-day triggering exercise at the GP&#13;
level. Since government support is guaranteed&#13;
for the poor, wealthier portions of the population&#13;
joined shop keepers in providing materials on&#13;
credit to poor households in their communities&#13;
in order to make their villages ODF and achieve&#13;
recognition and dignity for the entire community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Because people are motivated to construct and&#13;
use toilets as a matter of pride, dignity, and&#13;
health and not in order to obtain a government&#13;
subsidy, people in Churu construct toilets of their&#13;
own preference, mostly of a higher value than&#13;
those covered in the government incentive. Since&#13;
people are allowed to construct toilets according&#13;
to their preference, even poor households invest&#13;
additional resources, considering long-term usage.&#13;
In many cases, they even construct an additional&#13;
bathroom alongside the toilet. Nevertheless, the&#13;
district administration ensured that appropriate&#13;
technologies are used for toilets by showcasing&#13;
various toilet designs and by training masons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and Verification&#13;
Traditionally, government sanitation programs&#13;
monitor the number of toilets. But a campaign&#13;
that aims to make more and more villages ODF&#13;
has to monitor nothing but the number of ODF&#13;
villages. This shift in monitoring outcomes rather&#13;
than outputs has been evident in routine review&#13;

           stakeholders, inspiring similar                  open-defecation. If the team was convinced that&#13;
               initiatives in other districts               open-defecation had completely ceased in the GP,&#13;
                                                            they would recommend declaring it ODF. Once&#13;

A Campaign That Could Bring Swift&#13;
Progress at Scale&#13;

&#13;
Mandi district in Himachal Pradesh encompasses           Since the TSCâ&#128;&#153;s launch, swift progress in the&#13;
an area of 3,953 square kilometers housing a             sanitation sector resulted in 473 GPs of Mandi&#13;

0.93 percent reside in rural areas spread across 473     Free (ODF) by the end of 2010. The district also&#13;
Gram Panchayats (GPs). The district is divided into      claimed 283 Nirmal Gram Puraskars within a short&#13;
seven sub-divisions composed of 10 community             period of time. The most interesting fact is that&#13;
development blocks. Mandiâ&#128;&#153;s literacy rate is             the campaign never supported the construction of&#13;
73.7 percent, which is slightly lower than the state     toilets per se, but communities were motivated to&#13;

Under the TSC, incentives are provided to families&#13;
living below the poverty line (BPL). In other states,&#13;

However, in Mandi and in other districts of HP,                          rather than incentivizing&#13;
it was strategically decided that these incentives&#13;

Villages of Punjab                                            pursuing similar effective sewerage management&#13;
The management of human waste in large villages,              projects in other villages.&#13;
especially peri-urban villages, has been a challenge.&#13;
With tightly congested habitation, it has become              Both of these sites are large villages with religious&#13;
difficult for households to find space for properly           significance; in addition to the residents, there is a&#13;
designed septic tanks; most of the septic tanks are           huge floating population that makes regular visits&#13;
poorly designed and contaminate the environment,              for religious purposes. The houses are congested.&#13;
as their outlets are designed to feed into the open&#13;
drain. The only available technical solution in               The technology involved in this project includes the&#13;
these circumstances is a sewerage scheme, which               collection of sewage from households through UPVC&#13;
transports the waste and treats it effectively.               pipes, its transportation to a Sewerage Treatment&#13;
However, the experience of using these in other               Plant, where it is treated, and the subsequent drying&#13;
places, especially urban centers, has not been                of the sludge in a drying bed. Finally, the dried&#13;
encouraging, as they are disposed with very limited           sludge is composted for use as fertilizer. These&#13;
or no treatment into water bodies.                            projects were planned and implemented by the&#13;

  year in most parts of the district.                                        the coming year&#13;
l	Proactive support of senior district officials.&#13;
l	Cooperation of teachers and students.&#13;
l	Commitment     of GPs to make timely&#13;
  payments and ensure regular follow-up on&#13;
  the installation and functioning of Force&#13;
  Lift Pumps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key Achievements and Impact&#13;
l	The   use and maintenance of toilets has&#13;
  improved considerably in all schools.&#13;
l	Personal hygiene practices (hand-washing at&#13;
  critical times) of school children improved.&#13;
l	Children are now spared the drudgery of&#13;
  carrying water from handpumps to toilets in&#13;
  the schools.&#13;
l	More than 28 percent of schools in&#13;
  Hoshangabad have been covered under the&#13;
  Force Lift Pump program. There are further&#13;
  plans to cover all feasible sites over the&#13;
  coming year.&#13;
l	In many schools, the frequency of hiring&#13;
  paid labor to clean the washrooms has been&#13;
  drastically reduced. Prior to installing Force&#13;
  Lift Pumps, schools had to hire cleaners at&#13;
  least once a month; now they only need to&#13;
  call on such services every five to six months,&#13;
  saving schools between `450 and `600&#13;
  per month.&#13;
l	Water waste is minimized.&#13;
l	Point drainage at handpumps has&#13;
  improved considerably.&#13;

      Key Learning                                         l	Force  Lift Pumps are working well wherever&#13;
      l	Force Lift Pumps installed on the handpumps          groundwater is available year-round.&#13;
        of schools and anganwadis that are protected       l	Though Force Lift Pump technology is simple&#13;
        (thanks to boundary walls) were found to be          and easy to operate, spare parts are not readily&#13;
        functioning well, as there are fewer chances for     available in the market. In some areas, Force&#13;
        miscreants to steal or damage these pumps.           Lift Pumps are not operational due entirely to&#13;
      l	Force Lift Pumps installed on handpumps upon         this lack. Hence there is a need to mobilize the&#13;
        which the community does not depend for              private market to sell these parts.&#13;
        drinking water were found to be working well.&#13;
        In other cases, Force Lift Pumps were removed      For more information contact: District Coordinator,&#13;
        or damaged, presumably due to concerns over        Total Sanitation Campaign, Zilla Panchayatâ&#128;&#147;&#13;

            Pathway to success : compendium of best
            practices in rural sanitation in India

        <abstracts>
            One of the major challenges before India
            is to provide sustainable sanitation and hygiene to its vast
            diverse and growing population. The Government of India has
            declared its commitment towards achieving MDG goals and
            universal sanitation coverage in the country by the year
            2022, but with the current rural sanitation coverage of 32.7
            percent, this is a challenging task. The Ministry of
            Drinking Water and Sanitation has already risen to the
            occasion with renewed strategies and approaches. The
            existing Total Sanitation Campaign has been revamped and
            renamed as the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) in April 2012 by
            adopting community-led and people-centered strategies with a
            saturation approach backed by post-achievement incentives.
            One of the major shifts in the approach under NBA has been
            to adopt a more holistic approach in addressing issues
            related to sanitation. Apart from addressing the issues of
            building individual household toilets, community toilets,
            and constructing toilets in anganwadis and schools, the
            Government has placed a lot of emphasis on providing the
            much-needed flexibility to households to choose the
            sanitation technology they prefer from a variety of options
            based on socio-cultural aspects, hydro geographical
            conditions, and economic status.
