The Little Green Data Book 2007 is based on World Development Indicators&#13;
2007 and its accompanying CD-ROM. Defining, gathering, and disseminating&#13;
international statistics is a collective effort of many people and organizations.&#13;
The indicators presented in World Development Indicators are the fruit of&#13;
decades of work at many levels, from the field workers who administer&#13;
censuses and household surveys to the committees and working parties&#13;
of the national and international statistical agencies that develop the&#13;
nomenclature, classifications, and standards fundamental to the international&#13;
statistical system. Nongovernmental organizations have also made important&#13;
contributions. We are indebted to the network of World Development Indicators&#13;
partners, as detailed in World Development Indicators 2007. The financial&#13;
assistance of the Government of Sweden is also gratefully acknowledged.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Green Data Book 2007 is the result of close collaboration between&#13;
the staff of the Development Data Group of the Development Economics Vice&#13;
Presidency and the Environment Department. Mehdi Akhlaghi, Richard Fix,&#13;
Kirk Hamilton, Beat Hintermann, M. H. Saeed Ordoubadi, Giovanni Ruta, and&#13;
Alexandra Sears contributed to its preparation. Meta de Coquereaumont,&#13;
Christopher Trott, and Elaine Wilson of Communications Development&#13;

Welcome to the 2007 edition of The Little Green Data Book. This year's&#13;
edition includes a new Focus section, four introductory pages that focus&#13;
on a specific issue related to development and the environment--in this&#13;
edition, carbon dioxide emissions.&#13;
&#13;
Public discussion of climate change intensified during 2006 and early 2007.&#13;
The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change published the fourth in its&#13;
series of reports on the current scientific understanding of the impacts of&#13;
climate change on natural, managed, and human systems; the capacity of&#13;
these systems to adapt; and their vulnerability. The reports deem human&#13;
causation of climate change to be very likely. Late 2006 saw the publication&#13;
of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, which emphasizes&#13;
the major economic costs of climate change under different emission&#13;
scenarios and suggests that early action to curb emissions will reduce costs&#13;
substantially. As a response to this renewed attention to climate change,&#13;
the Focus section of The Little Green Data Book 2007 takes a closer look at&#13;
carbon dioxide emissions.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Green Data Book 2007 is a collaboration between the Development&#13;
Data Group of the Development Economics Vice Presidency and the&#13;
Environment Department of the World Bank. We welcome your suggestions&#13;
for how to improve future editions and make them more useful.&#13;

Trends in global carbon dioxide emissions&#13;
&#13;
Emissions worldwide topped 27 billion metric tons in 2003, an increase&#13;
of 19 percent over 1990 levels. During that time the relative share of&#13;
emissions coming from high-income and developing countries has changed&#13;
substantially.&#13;

Global distribution of carbon dioxide emissions, 2003&#13;
&#13;
In 2003 nearly half the world's carbon dioxide emissions from cement&#13;
manufacturing and the combustion of fossil fuels came from high-income&#13;
countries. The largest emitter is the United States. In the developing world&#13;
China and India are the major emitters.&#13;

Under the Kyoto Protocol, ratifying countries agreed to cut their 1990&#13;
emissions of greenhouse gases by amounts averaging 5.2 percent by&#13;
2008­12. Most industrial countries will not meet the target, and the United&#13;

Developing countries and the need for a new regulatory framework&#13;
&#13;
Worldwide, emissions increased 4 billion metric tons between 1990 and&#13;
2003. In addition to the emissions coming mainly from industrialized&#13;
countries, emissions increased substantially from China (1.7 billion metric&#13;
tons) and India (0.6 billion metric tons).&#13;

listed in Annex 1 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Annex&#13;
1 countries that have ratified the convention's Kyoto Protocol are committed to binding&#13;
emissions targets to reduce greenhouse gases. Non­Annex 1 countries are developing&#13;
countries, which have no specific greenhouse gas emissions obligations.&#13;

Emissions by source, developing countries, 2000&#13;
&#13;
In the developing world carbon dioxide emissions stem mostly from defor-&#13;
estation and the production of certain agricultural products. Electricity and&#13;
heat generation is also an increasing source of emissions.&#13;

&amp;#12;Data notes&#13;
The data in this book are for the most recent year available; for details, see&#13;
the Glossary. Regional aggregates include data for low- and middle-income&#13;
economies only. Aggregates for regions and income groups are shown only&#13;
if data are available for 66 percent of the economies in that group.&#13;
&#13;
Symbols used:&#13;
&#13;
        ..   indicates that data are not available or that aggregates cannot&#13;
             be calculated because of missing data.&#13;
&#13;
 0 or 0.0    indicates zero or small enough that the number rounds to zero&#13;
             at the displayed number of decimal places.&#13;
&#13;
        $    indicates current U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or for&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. The word country&#13;
(used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political independence&#13;
or official recognition by the World Bank but refers to any economy for which&#13;
the authorities report separate social or economic statistics.&#13;
&#13;
In keeping with World Development Indicators 2007, this edition of The Little&#13;
Green Data Book uses terminology in line with the 1993 system of National&#13;
Accounts (SNA). In particular, gross national product (GNP) is replaced by&#13;
gross national income (GNI).&#13;
&#13;
The selection of indicators in these pages includes some that are being used&#13;
to monitor progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. For more&#13;
information about the eight goals--halving poverty and increasing well-being&#13;
by 2015--please visit our Web site www.developmentgoals.org or see the&#13;

&amp;#12;                   Income group tables&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bank's main criterion&#13;
for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Every&#13;
economy is classified as low income, middle income (subdivided into lower&#13;
middle and upper middle), or high income. Low-and middle-income economies&#13;
are sometimes referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is&#13;
convenient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are&#13;
experiencing similar development or that other economies have reached a&#13;
preferred or final stage of development. Classification by income does not&#13;
necessarily reflect development status.&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $875 or less&#13;
in 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than&#13;
$875 but less than $10,726. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income&#13;
economies are separated at a GNI per capita of $3,465.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $10,726 or&#13;
more.&#13;

            The 2007 edition of the little green
            data book includes a new focus section, four introductory
            pages that focus on a specific issue related to development
            and the environment in this edition, carbon dioxide
            emissions. The reports deem human causation of climate
            change to be very likely. Late 2006 saw the publication of
            the Stern review on the economics of climate change, which
            emphasizes the major economic costs of climate change under
            different emission scenarios and suggests that early action
            to curb emissions will reduce costs substantially. As a
            response to this renewed attention to climate change, the
            focus section of the little green data book 2007 takes a
            closer look at carbon dioxide emissions.
