REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL&#13;
WATER SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:           Republic of Senegal&#13;
Beneficiaries:      The Government of Senegal (Ministry of Hydraulics, SONES and ONAS)&#13;
Poverty Category:   Program of Targeted Interventions&#13;
Amount:             SDR 63.5 million (US$100 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:              Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Onlending Terms:   US$85 million equivalent of the IDA credit would be provided by the&#13;
Government to SONES, of which 45 percent would be onlent to SONES&#13;
at IBRD terms (20 years including 5 years of grace, at an annual interest&#13;
rate of 7.1 percent), and the remaining 55 percent would be provided in the&#13;
form of equity. SONES would bear the foreign exchange risk. The&#13;
remaining US$15 million equivalent of the IDA credit would be provided&#13;
to the Ministry of Hydraulics through a budgetary allocation.&#13;
Financing Plan:     See para. 4.46&#13;
Project Objectives:   The proposed project supports the second of Senegal's three step strategy&#13;
for the long-term development of its water sector. The first, supported by&#13;
the Eleven Centers Water Supply Project (Cr. 1554-SE, closed in 1993),&#13;
helped to establish SONEES, a competent parastatal.  The second,&#13;
supported by the proposed operation, deepens the institutional reform,&#13;
makes critical investments to meet the demand for safe water for the year&#13;
2000, and sets the stage for the third step. The third step would assure the&#13;
long-term sustainability of the sector and could be supported by a future&#13;
operation. The overall development objectives of the proposed project are&#13;
to address: (a) sustainability, by improving management, pricing, and&#13;
cost recovery and reducing the Government subsidy for industrial,&#13;
domestic, and irrigation water; (b) poverty alleviation and health, by&#13;
increasing access to safe potable water and adequate and more affordable&#13;
sanitation for the urban poor; and, (c) private sector participation, by&#13;
engaging a private company to manage urban water supply. The specific&#13;
project implementation objectives are: 1. In water resource management:&#13;
to formulate an integrated, multisectoral strategy for the shared use of&#13;
water by households, industry, and agriculture that will be coordinated&#13;
with future development projects in these sectors. 2. In institutional&#13;
capacity building: to strengthen the capacity of SGPRE to monitor aquifer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v&#13;
exploitation, that of the newly established SONES to formulate and&#13;
enforce policy and strategy, and that of the newly established ONAS to&#13;
develop a strategy for urban and peri-urban sanitation improvement. 3. In&#13;
urban water production and distribution: to reduce leakages in the&#13;
Greater Dakar water distribution system (from the current estimated 27 to&#13;
15 percent), and to increase the Dakar region's water production capacity&#13;
from the current 202,000 cubic meters a day to 271,000 cubic meters, an&#13;
increase of 34 percent.  4. In urban sanitation:  to increase the&#13;
effectiveness of the existing Dakar sewerage system, develop sanitation in&#13;
secondary towns, and, promote the reuse of treated municipal wastewater&#13;
for irrigation.&#13;
Project Description:  1. Institutional Capacity Building (base cost: US$8.1 million).  To&#13;
achieve a better water resource management, the proposed project would&#13;
support the Ministry of Hydraulics and SGPRE in the preparation of a&#13;
national water resource management strategy. To make more potable&#13;
water available, it would support the newly created SONES in managing&#13;
sector policy (including auditing and cost accounting).  To improve&#13;
sanitation services, it would support the newly created ONAS in the&#13;
formulation of a national strategy for sanitation in urban and peri-urban&#13;
areas.&#13;
2. Urban Water Supply (base cost: US$207.5 million). To increase the&#13;
production of safe water drinking for Dakar, the proposed project would&#13;
rehabilitate physical works and also expand water production and&#13;
transport through the use of boreholes, treatment works, pipelines, clean&#13;
water storage, and the building of a remote control and management&#13;
system. It would improve and extend urban water distribution through&#13;
network rehabilitation, renovation, and expansion (including new pipes,&#13;
large water meters, and new connections to low-income households). It&#13;
would provide such logistical support as consulting services (with regard&#13;
to final studies, bid documents, and work supervision); and, a pilot plant&#13;
and environmental impact studies of the long-term water needs in Dakar.&#13;
It would also provide necessary laboratory equipment and rehabilitate&#13;
office facilities.&#13;
3. Urban Sanitation (base cost: US$32.0 million). The proposed project&#13;
would increase connections to the existing sewer system in Dakar, treat&#13;
and reuse pern-urban municipal sewage for irrigation, prepare sewerage&#13;
masterplans for nineteen secondary cities and riparian centers, implement a&#13;
rainwater sanitation project in the St. Louis area, and, implement the&#13;
Rufisque sewerage and urban drainage subproject.&#13;
Benefits:           The proposed project would help deepen the reforms of the water sector by&#13;
improving its management, financial accountability, and resource&#13;
allocation capacity. This would help the Government to keep water&#13;
shortages in the Dakar region within manageable levels until a long-term&#13;
solution can be implemented. It is estimated that 1.8 million people would&#13;
benefit from the project, which would reduce the water deficit and make&#13;
distribution more equitable and reliable. By providing a steady supply of&#13;
potable water, the project would relieve one of the major hardships bome&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI&#13;
by those living in poverty.  In pen'-urban areas, women, who are&#13;
traditionally charged with the family water supply duties, would realize&#13;
substantial savings in effort and time. Under the proposed project, the&#13;
Rufisque population (estimated at 150,000), would also benefit from&#13;
improved sanitation. For nineteen other urban centers recently provided&#13;
with a safe piped-water supply, sewerage and sanitation master plans&#13;
would be prepared to improve sanitation services to a total population of&#13;
735,000.  Construction activities under the project, moreover, would&#13;
create about 15,000 person-years of temporary employment.&#13;
Risks:               The proposed project poses four primary risks. (a) at the institutional&#13;
level, it is uncertain that: SONES will assume responsibilities from&#13;
SONEES in an effective and timely manner. To address this risk, capacity&#13;
building for SONES would include:  (i) water sector planning and&#13;
development; (ii) project management and implementation; (iii) selection&#13;
of appropriate water supply and sanitation technologies;  and (iv)&#13;
performance monitoring, including maintenance audits;  (b) at the&#13;
financial level: whether the objective of sector equilibrium in 2003 will be&#13;
met within the established timeframe given the country's precarious&#13;
economic and fiscal situation which remains difficult. To address this&#13;
risk, (i) a politically and socially sustainable tariff policy would be applied&#13;
to achieve sector financial equilibrium by the year 2003, and key&#13;
performance indicators would be used during project supervision, with&#13;
clear targets; (c) at the private sector level: whether there will be a&#13;
sufficient interest from several private companies, given the complexity of&#13;
the Dakar situation and the introduction of renewal of the distribution&#13;
network as part of the affermage contract. To address this risk, several&#13;
upfront actions were taken before negotiations, namely: the creation of&#13;
SONES, and, the information workshop for prequalified firms.  In&#13;
addition, as a condition of effectiveness, Government would enter into an&#13;
affernage contract satisfactory to IDA, with the private operator; and (d)&#13;
at the private operator level: whether the lowest bid will be sufficiently&#13;
low to allow for financial viability of the water sector at a tariff level&#13;
acceptable to the Senegalese authorities. This issue has been addressed&#13;
through measures including (i) the capacity building program devised for&#13;
SONES (see (a) above), (ii) the actions adopted in order to ensure&#13;
sufficient interest from different candidates private companies (see (b)&#13;
above) and (iii) the specific measures aimed at minimizing the risks of&#13;
non-payment or late payment of water bills by Government.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL&#13;
WATER SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   Senegal is a medium-sized country (196,722 kIn2) with 550 kilometers of Atlantic&#13;
coastline. It is located at the westermnost point of the African Continent. Senegal is generally flat&#13;
and lies in the Senegal-Mauritanian Depression. Elevations above 100 meters are found only on its&#13;
eastern and southeastern borders with Mali and Guinea and near Dakar at the tip of the Cap Vert&#13;
peninsula. Three-fourths of the country lies in the Sahel, which has suffered from a lower-than-&#13;
normal average rainfall for the last forty years. The country itself has a tropical subdesert climate,&#13;
with wet summers and dry winters. Senegal's development options are severely constrained by its&#13;
arid climate. The rainy season is limited to a seasonal monsoon, wetter in the south (less than 1000&#13;
milimeters from May to October) than in the north (greater than 300 milimeters from June to&#13;
September). Rainfall is about 500 milimeters a year in Dakar (Annex 1-1). The duration,&#13;
intensity, and seasonal distribution of the rains at any one location varies considerably from year to&#13;
year, particularly in areas of lowest rainfall. It is now accepted that Sahelian rainfall depends on&#13;
features outside of its range, primarily ocean temperatures off the coast of South America.&#13;
1.2   The large sand dunes that give northeastern Senegal its undulating and ribbed surface are a&#13;
reminder that Senegal borders the Sahara Desert and that, in the recent past, Senegal was much&#13;
drier than it is today. Evaporation rates are extremely high, and everywhere in the country,&#13;
potential annual evaporation rates exceed potential rainfall. The harmattan, a hot wind that blows&#13;
out of the Sahara for part of the year and exacerbates this problem, carries dust as far south as&#13;
Casamance in southern Senegal (see map IBRD 23122).&#13;
Economy&#13;
1.3    At the time of Senegal's independence, it had one of the most developed economies in West&#13;
Africa. But its economy declined with the loss of markets in newly independent sister states and&#13;
because of long periods of bad weather and weak management. According to World Bank and&#13;
IMF estimates, the gross national product (GNP) of the Republic of Senegal in 1994 was CFAF&#13;
2,060,300 million. Based on the estimated population, the per capita GNP was US$611.2 in 1994,&#13;
at an exchange rate of 555.2 CFAF to the US dollar, using the Atlas method.&#13;
1.4   The primary, secondary, and tertiary (including nonmercantile services ) sectors account&#13;
for 20.9 percent, 19.3 percent and 59.8 percent of the 1994 GDP, respectively. In the past decade,&#13;
the primary sector has been shrinking and the secondary sector expanding, while the tertiary sector&#13;
has maintained its level. The agriculture sector employs about 70 percent of the labor force, and&#13;
half the cultivated land is in groundnut production. Government policy is to diversify agriculture&#13;
and reduce dependence on groundnuts. With that end in mind, cotton, rice, sugar, and vegetables&#13;
are now being planted in increased quantities. Senegal also has a relatively developed, but&#13;
somewhat inefficient manufacturing sector, primarily located around Dakar.  Much of the&#13;
industrial output is in food, beverages, and tobacco products. Tourism also grew substantially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
substantially in the 1970s, and again after the January 1994 devaluation. But Senegal still depends&#13;
on foreign assistance to offset a chronic balance-of-trade deficit.&#13;
Population and Urbanization&#13;
1.5    While the economy of Senegal grew at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent from 1982 to&#13;
1992, the population also grew at a relatively high rate of 2.5 percent per year. The population&#13;
was 3.5 million at independence in 1960, 6.9 million in 1988, and 8.5 million in 1992. The&#13;
population growth rate is not expected to slow in the near future and by the year 2006, it is&#13;
estimated that Senegal will have nearly 12.4 million inhabitants - a figure that will be more than 18&#13;
million by the year 2021. In the urban areas (defined here as agglomerations of more than 10,000&#13;
inhabitants), the average population growth is about 3.7 percent per year, and in the Cap Vert&#13;
Peninsula (including the capital city of Dakar), it reaches a rate between 5 and 6 percent. In&#13;
Senegal there is sustained migration from rural to urban areas, particularly to Dakar and its&#13;
surroundings. In 1902 the Government was transferred from Saint Louis to Dakar. The&#13;
population of the city has since grown from 18,000 in 1902 to 350,000 in 1960, and then to 1.8&#13;
million in 1992 (48.2 percent of urban population and 22 percent of total population). It is&#13;
expected to reach 2.3 million by the year 2000. Whereas in the 1960s 73 percent of the population&#13;
lived in rural areas and 27 percent in urban areas, in 1992 only 45.6 percent lived in rural areas&#13;
with 54.4 percent in urban areas.&#13;
1.6    Today approximately 54 percent of Senegal's urban population has access to a safe supply&#13;
of piped water. Another 42 percent has access only to public fountains, and the remainder obtains&#13;
water from conventional sources or from water vendors. In rural areas only about 65 percent of&#13;
the population has access to a safe and reliable water supply, and service levels for waste-water&#13;
and sewage disposal are considerably lower. Only about 20 percent of the urban population is&#13;
connected to a water-bome sewerage system, and only about 12 percent of urban dwellers are&#13;
connected to a sewerage system. The remainder relies on seepage pits or has no disposal system at&#13;
all. Because of the serious backlog and the tremendous financial backing required to upgrade&#13;
service levels, the system is likely to deteriorate further before improvements can be achieved.&#13;
2. WATER RESOURCES&#13;
Renewable Resources&#13;
2.1    Surface water. Senegal is served by four major rivers: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, and&#13;
Casamance, all of which are wide and meandering for most of their length. The Senegal River is&#13;
by far the major source of surface water in Senegal (Figure 2.1). Since the completion of the&#13;
Manantali dam in 1988, the minimum regulated flow of the Senegal River at Richard Toll is 26&#13;
million cubic meters per day. With the decrease in rainfall over the last forty years, river flows in&#13;
the lower Senegal River have decreased from average levels of more than 30 billion cubic meters&#13;
per year to averages of less than 20 billion, reaching a new low in 1984 of less than 10 billion&#13;
cubic meters per year. Because of high evaporation rates, Senegal has practically no permanent,&#13;
significant, surface-water bodies-with the exception of the Lac de Guiers, which is replenished&#13;
yearly by the floods of the Senegal River. But since the completion of the dams at Manantali and&#13;
Diama, ponds that used to dry out periodically are now more or less perennial.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
2.2    Groundwater. Except in the southeastern region, Senegal sits on a sedimentary basin that&#13;
contains   large   quantities   of   groundwater.&#13;
Figure 2.1. RelatiDistribution ofSurface   Groundwater resources often have more buffer&#13;
Water Resources in Senegal&#13;
capacity for variations in rainfall than do rivers,&#13;
since the latter respond more directly to seasonal&#13;
Other surface              variations.  Groundwater resources are therefore&#13;
water resources             relied upon extensively in many rural and urban&#13;
1%                      areas in Senegal and are a viable alternative to&#13;

abstraction exceeds replenishments over the long&#13;
run, the source will be depleted.&#13;
2.3    Western wells typically reach down  30&#13;
meters to aquifers, but in the Ferlo, they can be as&#13;
Senegal river   deep as  100 meters.   Renewable groundwater&#13;
83°    resources are dependent on recharge from the annual&#13;
rainfall to retain long-term  sustainibility.   The&#13;
deepest aquifers, in the sandstone and sand are located at the bottom of the Maestrichtian&#13;
sedimentary basin. Boreholes to these aquifers reach down 100 meters in the eastern part of the&#13;
basin and nearly 300 meters elsewhere. The water there is under pressure and rises naturally close&#13;
to the ground surface. These aquifers are partly replenished by river floods but in large part are&#13;
inherited from earlier times.&#13;
2.4    Exploitation of groundwater from old sources, or sources with negligible recharge, is&#13;
regarded as mining of a finite resource and violates the principle of sustainable development where&#13;
the abstraction volume is larger than the capacity of the aquifer. Other sub-regionally important&#13;
aquifers include the infrabasaltic aquifer of the Dakar Region, the Miocene aquifer in Casamance,&#13;
the alluvial aquifers of the Senegal River, and the aquifers of the coastal sand dunes in the north.&#13;
Groundwater is also found in the old formations of the geological platform in South Eastern&#13;
Senegal (south-southeast of Bakel and southeast of Simenti, in the foothills of the Fouta Djalon).&#13;
The volume of total groundwater resources is about 410 to 585 billion cubic meters, with a&#13;
recharge capacity of approximately 3 to 4 billion cubic meters per year distributed among the&#13;
various aquifer systems.&#13;
2.5    Groundwater represents an important source of water for urban, semi-urban, and rural&#13;
areas throughout the country, and the number of new boreholes and wells is rapidly increasing.&#13;
Forty-one urban centers are served mainly by groundwater resources, as are the majority of&#13;
industrial companies, mining companies, and tourist resorts.   For irrigated  agriculture,&#13;
groundwater accounts only for a small share as compared to surface water. Of 50,000 hectares of&#13;
irrigated land in Senegal, only 2,000 hectares use water from groundwater resources.&#13;
Groundwater-fed agriculture is predominantly horticulture (market gardening) located near Dakar,&#13;
which consumed 24,000 cubic meters per day on average in 1994 (para. 3.19, Annex 8).&#13;
2.6    Water Quality.  Along the coast and near estuaries, over-exploitation of groundwater&#13;
resources has led to saline intrusions and a dramatic decline in water quality. In the Dakar region,&#13;
groundwater resources are overexploited, resulting in an excessive draw-down of the water table&#13;
and the increasing danger of salt-water intrusion from the ocean. In certain well-field areas near&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Pout and Sebikhotane, the groundwater level is being depleted by up to 1.5 meters per year, which&#13;
has had an impact on the vegetation.&#13;
2.7    Senegal's urban areas have met part of their water needs by drawing from shallow wells,&#13;
which are often polluted by the latrines and septic tanks that filter directly into the water table.&#13;
Most of the wells in Thiaroye, for instance, contain traces of ammonium and nitrite, suggesting&#13;
fecal contamination or seepage from fertilizers. This is even more probable for private wells,&#13;
generaly located near sanitation facilities. Concentrations of nitrate observed in many wells&#13;
particularly in Thiaroye generally exceed the limit prescribed in the WHO's drinking water&#13;
guidelines and may cause methemoglobinemia. This suggests that groundwater in the area may be&#13;
affected by seepage from on-site sanitation facilities.&#13;
2.8   In fast-growing urban areas, experience has shown that intermittent supply of water and&#13;
chronic water shortages have a detrimental impact on public health. An intermittent water supply&#13;
also leads to water waste and disrupts industry causing economic losses. The proposed project&#13;
would help to alleviate this problem.&#13;
2.9    Other water quality concerns are pollution from  chemical products (in particular&#13;
pesticides) in agriculture, which could be contaminating large areas, the most vulnerable being&#13;
Richard Toll and the Lac de Guiers.&#13;
2.10   Water Reuse. Despite serious water shortages in Dakar, about 11 percent of the drinking&#13;
water production is currently being used for horticulture, although according to the directives of the&#13;
Societe nationale d'exploitation des eaux du Sdndgal (SONEES) it should not exceed 7 percent&#13;
(para. 3.19). The feasibility of reusing urban sewage (after treatment) for market gardening&#13;
irrigation has been studied but not implemented. While reuse of wastewater for agricultural&#13;
irrigation is often considered as an additional water resource in arid areas like the region Dakar-&#13;
Thies, it is not Senegal's only, or even major reason for water recycling. Wastewater is a public&#13;
health and environmental concern. If the means are economically and technically feasible and&#13;
socially acceptable, agricultural or industrial reuse would dispose of wastewater in a sanitary&#13;
manner. Reuse of sewage could thus become a key feature in future water demand management&#13;
and help reconcile Dakar's water needs. But, because of the limited number of connections to the&#13;
existing sewerage system in Dakar, the volume of treated wastewater today is relatively limited&#13;
(approximately 4,000 to 5,000 cubic meters per day) as compared to horticultural demands (more&#13;
than 15,000 cubic meters per day).&#13;
2.11   Urban Runoff. Increasing urbanization affects all phases of the water cycle in settlement&#13;
areas, with far-reaching changes taking place in precipitation, evaporation, evapotranspiration,&#13;
infiltration, and runoff. Urban drainage is becoming a key issue in the management of water&#13;
resources. According to a recent study on urban drainage and wastewater systems in the greater&#13;
Dakar area-financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-drainage of all areas&#13;
having an elevation of higher than four meters should be done by infiltration. Depressed areas in&#13;
each closed catchment area (except for the proposed pump drainage areas) should be kept for&#13;
infiltration and retention, and on-site infiltration should be applied in high areas. In the Central&#13;
Pikine area, an urban drainage priority pilot-project is being prepared which will address an&#13;
environmental health problem caused by bodies of stagnant water in this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Demand and Resource Allocation&#13;
2.12   Urban Water Demand   Demand forecasts in the Dakar/Cap Vert regions show a&#13;
constrained water supply with unsatisfied demand growing by as much as 30 percent in the coming&#13;
decade. Population growth in the Dakar/Cap Vert region is projected to decrease from the present&#13;
5.3 percent to 3.8 percent a year during the 1990s, to 3.2 percent a year during the first decade of&#13;
the next century, thereafter to 2 percent a year.  Basic per capita consumption for house&#13;
connections is estimated to remain at 110 liters per capita per day until the year 2000 and to&#13;
increase to 120 liters per capita per day by the year 2020. Water consumption at public standpipes&#13;
is projected to remain constant at 20 liters per capita per day.&#13;
2.13   In 1994, the total theoretical demand of the Greater Dakar region, which comprises four&#13;
agglomerated urban areas, Dakar, Pikine, Rufisque and Sebikotane, and two rural communities&#13;
Sangalkam and Bambylor, with a total estimated population of 1,96 million, is estimated at&#13;
230,000 cubic meters per day. This demand figure assumes a 100 percent population supplied,&#13;
with 80 percent household consumption by house connection and 20 percent by public standpipes.&#13;
In addition, water consumption by industry, commerce and governmental agencies would account&#13;
for about 50,000 cubic meters per day. By the year 2000, taking into account a 3.8 percent annual&#13;
growth rate of the population in the Dakar region, total demand will increase to about 275,000&#13;
cubic meters per day. In 1994, about 80,2 percent of the total population in the Dakar region was&#13;
served with piped drinking water supply, or about 1,57 million people. In order to provide 24&#13;
hours of service per day, a drinking water supply of about 210,000 cubic meters per day would be&#13;
required. This was calculated on the basis of 129,414 house connections (with 10 inhabitants&#13;
served per connection) and 928 public standpipes (with 300 inhabitants served per standpipe).&#13;
(Annex 2-2).&#13;
2.14   In 1994, SONEES supplied 94 million cubic meters for all of Senegal's urban areas. The&#13;
drinking water volume available to meet demand in 1994 in the Dakar region was however only&#13;
equal to 128,000 cubic meters per day, which translates into a deficit of about 82,000 cubic meters&#13;
per day. This deficit lead, on average, to only 16 hours of service per day, which has a detrimental&#13;
impact on water quality as a result of intermittent water supply (para. 2.8). Water losses from&#13;
leakage and illegal connections, were estimated at 27 percent of production in 1994 but are&#13;
projected to be reduced to 15 percent by the year 2000. As altemative sources are developed, the&#13;
use of costly potable water for market gardening (11 percent of production in 1993, or 23,000&#13;
cubic meters per day) is targeted to diminish to 4 percent (or 14,000 cubic meters per day) in the&#13;
year 2000. Works included in the proposed project will increase drinking water production&#13;
capacity from 202,000 to 266,000 cubic meters per day, of which 60,000 cubic meters per day&#13;
additional capacity will directly benefit the Dakar region. As location of demand does not coincide&#13;
with the location where water is available, new transmission systems will have to be built. A new&#13;
transmission from the Senegal river, planned within the framework of the long-term solution for&#13;
water supply for Dakar, would not be ready before 2003-2005, when unsatisfied demand in Dakar&#13;
will have risen again to about 30 percent of the total estimated water demand.&#13;
2.15   In addition to running the Dakar water supply system, SONEES also manages water&#13;
supply facilities in 48 secondary centers. Although the situation in these areas is less serious than&#13;
in Dakar and present demand is being almost fully met, considerable investment will have to be&#13;
made to meet future demand. The estimated long-term water supply demand for the Dakar region&#13;
as a whole is projected to grow from about 100 million cubic meters per year (275,000 cubic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
meters per day) in 2000 to about 160 million cubic meters per year (435,000 cubic meters per day)&#13;
in 2020.&#13;
2.16   Rural Water Demand It is estimated that one-fifth of Senegal's rural population of about&#13;
4.2 million is scattered or nomadic and can not be provided with water by conventional supply&#13;
systems. These people will continue to use such traditional water sources as rivers, springs, and&#13;
ponds. The remaining 80 percent of Senegal's rural population-some 3.4 million people-depend on&#13;
constructed wells or bore-hole systems. From 1981 to 1994, the number of deep wells increased&#13;
from 101 to 697 units, with a total capacity of 80,000 cubic meters per day. The average rural&#13;
dweller, therefore, has about 24 liters of water available per day, although some regions and&#13;
villages are in fact more advanced, while others receive almost no service. The Govemment's&#13;
objective is to supply all of Senegal's sedentary rural population with a volume of 35 liters per&#13;
capita per day by the year 2010. By then, the target population will have grown to about 4.7&#13;
million, and the total required capacity will be 165,000 cubic meters per day. Additional capacity&#13;
of over 80,000 cubic meters per day must consequently be created. All rural water supply&#13;
networks will have to be extended, 800 new wells and 2,880 boreholes will have to be constructed,&#13;
and 4,500 wells and boreholes will have to be rehabilitated and deepened.&#13;
2.17   Senegal River Left Bank. This project, which is under preparation with IDA assistance,&#13;
aims to irrigate the left bank of the Senegal River Valley, where anticipated water demand is on the&#13;
order of 2 billion cubic meters per year.&#13;
2.18   The Compagnie Sucriere du Sne6gal (CSS). Located on the left bank of the Senegal&#13;
River near Richard Toll, has developed some 8,000 hectares of sugar cane fields, which require&#13;
approximately 188 million cubic meters of water a year.&#13;
2.19   The Canal du Cayor. This proposal, in the making for almost a decade, would offer one&#13;
altemative way to satisfy the long-term demand for domestic water in the Dakar region. The canal&#13;
would be 240 kilometers long from the Lac de Guiers to the Thies Region (Map IBRD 23122).&#13;
The canal would also supply water for aquifer recharge along its course and irrigation water for&#13;
some 8,500 hectares in the Cap Vert and the Cayor area. Its maximum transport capacity for&#13;
domestic water supply in the year 2020 is estimated at about 880,000 cubic meters per day, while&#13;
the peak water demand for irrigation water during March-April is 610,000 cubic meters per day.&#13;
In 2020, the canal would have an average total hydraulic capacity of 1.73 million cubic meters per&#13;
day. As agreed by Governments concerned (Mali, Mauritania, Senegal) at the Organisation pour&#13;
la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Senegal (OMVS) meeting (para. 2.23) in Nouakchott in July 1994,&#13;
the total water allocation to Senegal from the Senegal River for the Canal du Cayor project would&#13;
be 820 million cubic meters per year (or 26 cubic meters per second). An IDA-financed feasibility&#13;
study has indicated that the conveyance of water through an open canal seems to be the most&#13;
economic long-term solution for the Dakar water supply. It is necessary to re-assess the alternative&#13;
solutions from a technical and from a multisectoral water resource management perspective before&#13;
a definitive decision can be taken. The Canal du Cayor proposal is not expected to have financial&#13;
impact until the year 2003, when the definitive solution would be agreed and the water supply&#13;
sector finances would be in balance (para. 5.3).&#13;
2.20   The Vall6es Fossiles. This proposal aims at revitalizing the hydrological systems in the&#13;
fossil valleys to preserve their groundwater resources while supporting the development of&#13;
agriculture, livestock production, and fisheries, and the reforestation and restoration of ecosystems.&#13;
The water would be partly abstracted from the Senegal River at Bakel and partly from the Diama&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Dam via the Lac de Guiers. Cooperation has been established between the Vallees Fossiles project&#13;
and the Canal du Cayor project to share the water allocated to Senegal from the Diama Dam&#13;
operations. Projected water demand for the Vallees Fossiles proposal is approximately 1.4 billion&#13;
cubic meters per year (3,836 million cubic meters per day), which would be diverted from the&#13;
Senegal River during the flooding period, when an estimated excess of 10 billion cubic meters of&#13;
water from the river flows into the sea.&#13;
2.21    Hydroelectric power. The hydroelectric operations at Manantali, to be completed in 1998,&#13;
will reduce downstream flow-rates by 10 to 15 percent. Hydroelectric operations require timing of&#13;
water flows to meet electricity demands, which do not necessarily match demands for irrigation,&#13;
artificial flooding (the Vallees Fossiles), or other uses downstream. These concerns are under the&#13;
responsibility of OMVS. They will have implications for the operation of the Manantali and the&#13;
Diama Dam and are to be addressed in a broader water resource management strategy (para. 4.9).&#13;

2.22    Even if the current groundwater extraction stipulated in table 2.2, is only about 5 percent&#13;
of the estimated national groundwater recharge capacity, some aquifers in densely populated areas,&#13;
such as the Cap Vert region, are prone to over-exploitation. The main environmental concern is the&#13;
impact of the temporary over-exploitation of the littoral soil aquifers, which could lead to salt-&#13;
water intrusion, which would ruin traditional shallow wells now used for rural water supply. An&#13;
environmental impact assessment study based on a groundwater model concluded that another&#13;
35,000 cubic meters per day can be drawn from Senegal's north coastal groundwater resources&#13;
with moderate environmental consequences (para. 7.12)&#13;

Institutions&#13;
2.23    By joint agreement with Senegal, Mauritania, and Mali, the OMVS was established in&#13;
1972 to foster irrigation development along the Senegal River (Guinea is not a signatory). OMVS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
is a river basin management organization responsible for coordination and harmonization of&#13;
projects in the Senegal River catchment area. It is responsible for hydrological services, long-term&#13;
water allocation among the riparian countries, and ensuring that the operation of the dam systems&#13;
(including hydropower, for instance by artificial floods) is environmentally sustainable. The treaty&#13;
requires member states to inform the OMVS of any works undertaken on the river, which must be&#13;
approved by the Conseil des Ministres de l'OMVS before they can be implemented. OMVS also&#13;
proposes to its member countries how the financing of its operations shall be shared.&#13;
2.24   In spite of its relatively modest track record, OMVS is still a key partner in developing the&#13;
region's water resource management strategy and in preparing similar strategies for other riparian&#13;
countries. The Canal du Cayor was endorsed by OMVS and integrated in its water allocation&#13;
budgets, whereas the Vallees Fossiles is still under OMVS consideration. Meetings between&#13;
OMVS and representatives of the Canal du Cayor and Vall&amp;es Fossiles projects help to assure&#13;
coordination in the use of land and water resources between these two ventures.&#13;
2.25   The Organisation de Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Gambie (OMVG) was originally&#13;
established by Senegal and the Gambia in 1978. Guinea joined in 1980 and Guinea Bissau in&#13;
1983. Guinea Bissau contains only 0.02 percent of the Gambia catchment. The OMVG does not&#13;
confine its concern solely to development within the Gambia River basin but also sponsors studies&#13;
on other basins within the member states.&#13;
2.26   Ministry of Hydraulics.  The overall responsibility for water resource management,&#13;
drinking water supply, and sewerage in urban and rural areas lies with the Ministry of Hydraulics.&#13;
The Ministry of Hydraulics has three departments: (Annex 2-1)&#13;
*    The Service de Gestion et de Planification des Ressources en Eau (SGPRE) is&#13;
responsible for water resource studies, the determination of the water balance, the&#13;
monitoring of water resources, water resource management and allocation, the&#13;
preparation of laws and regulations related to the management and protection of&#13;
water resources, and regulatory enforcement. It comprises the Central Bureau and&#13;
three Regional Brigades responsible for hydrological data collection, processing,&#13;
analysis and study. This department also disseminates data and information to&#13;
users.&#13;
*    The Direction de l'Hydraulique et de l'Assainissement (DHA) is responsible for&#13;
engineering studies and the supervision of works on dams and other hydraulic&#13;
projects in rural areas (wells, reservoirs, etc.), and sewerage and waste-water&#13;
treatment plants. It also supervises SONEES.&#13;
*    The Direction de  'Exploitation et de la Maintenance des Ouvrages d'Hydraulique&#13;
Rurale (DEM) is responsible (with DHA), for the development and implementation&#13;
of water supply projects in rural areas, for technical support to and coordination of&#13;
the actions of village committees, and for the maintenance and renovation of rural&#13;
water supply installations.&#13;
2.27   Other Water Resource Management Actors. The Ministry of Hydraulics oversees both&#13;
the Mission d'Etude et d'Amenagement du Canal du Cayor (MEACC) and the Mission d'Etude et&#13;
dAmenagement des Valles Fossiles (MEAVF). MEACC carries out studies and works related to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
the long-term supply of water from the Senegal River via the Lac de Guiers to the Dakar/Cap Vert&#13;
regions. MEAVF is responsible for the execution of studies and the development of all fossil&#13;
valleys in the country (Ferlo, Sine, Saloum, Baobolong, and Sandougou). Its works include river&#13;
profiles, dikes, water intakes, and canals that reintroduce water into the valleys. Its aim is to&#13;
reconstitute the national hydrographic network.&#13;
2.28   The Ministere du developpement rural (MDR) has the supervision of the Unite de&#13;
politique agricole (UPA) dealing with agriculture policy matters, and linked to the use of water&#13;
resources. The Ministere de I 'Economie, des Finances et du Plan (MEFP) supervises the Cellule&#13;
apres barrages (CAB), an institution in charge of preparing a master plan for the development of&#13;
the left bank of the Senegal River, the Plan Directeur de la Rive Gauche (PDRG). The Direction&#13;
de la Sante Publique under the Ministere de la Sante is responsible for the establishment and&#13;
enforcement of the national drinking water quality standards.&#13;
2.29 Creation of the Conseil superieur de l'environnement et des ressources naturelles&#13;
(CONSERE) in 1993 ushered in a new era in environmental management in Senegal. It is&#13;
necessary to coordinate the water resource management strategy with the Ministry of&#13;
Environment's new National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), which sets forth the institutional,&#13;
legal, economic, and technical measures needed to safeguard the environment while pursuing&#13;
development goals.&#13;
2.30   Water Resource Information Systems. Two information systems were created as part of&#13;
the Planification des ressources en eau project. The Systeme d'information geographique sur les&#13;
ressources en eau du Senegal (SIGRES) is an information system on water resources, water use,&#13;
and users. The Banque informatique de suivi et d'evaluation des projects du secteur eau&#13;
(BISEPSE) is a data base with information about water-related projects. SIGRES and BISEPSE&#13;
served as the basis for the report Bilan diagnostic des ressources en eau du Senegal (September&#13;
1994), prepared by a group of national and international experts. These systems will also serve as&#13;
the basis for the Schemas directeurs regionaux d'amenagement hydraulique (SDAH), which&#13;
proposes to establish seven water management zones selected on the basis of water resources and&#13;
water development typologies, and the national Plan directeur de developpement des ressources&#13;
en Eau (PDRE).&#13;
Emerging Strategy&#13;
2.31   Although many studies have been conducted on Senegal's surface water and groundwater&#13;
resources, no comprehensive water resource management strategy has yet been devised for&#13;
balancing these resources with demand. Water has been extracted on an ad hoc basis and -except&#13;
for the Senegal River-, no authority controls water use. The discharge of domestic, industrial, and&#13;
agricultural wastewater is also not regulated and lack of water resource management has resulted&#13;
in mineral accumulation in the Lac de Guiers from agricultural runoff, over-exploitation of the&#13;
Cape Vert aquifers at the risk of salt intrusion, and the discharge of untreated urban domestic&#13;
sewage into surface and groundwater bodies. With no coherent sector development strategy in&#13;
place, furthermore, no major expansion work have been realized since 1975.&#13;
2.32   Coordination among several large water development programs, (like Dakar Water&#13;
Supply, Rive Gauche, Vallees Fossiles and Canal du Cayor) has now been established, and the&#13;
OMVS is engaged in overall water allocation among the three major countries bordering the&#13;
Senegal River. Basic principles guiding the allocation of water to large development projects in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Senegal from the Senegal River include the aim of promoting agriculture and rural development&#13;
through synergy between the projects and equitable allocation of water; ensuring efficient and&#13;
coherent water resource management; rehabilitating and protecting the environment; and securing&#13;
long-term and sustainable urban and rural water supplies.&#13;
2.33   Proposed Framework. To establish a commonly recognized water resource management&#13;
strategy for managing water resources, Senegal's Government is implementing new laws and&#13;
institutional adjustments based on the Decrets du Code de l'Eau (Loi 81-13 du 4 mars 1981). The&#13;
recent consolidation of the Ministry of Hydraulics and the creation of SGPRE aim to improve the&#13;
management of water resources. The Government's intention is to strengthen this division, give it&#13;
responsibility for managing and allocating all national water resources, and give it full authority&#13;
over permits for water extraction. The SGPRE recently established a data base for water resource&#13;
planning and management (through the UNDP-supported Water Master Plan Project). That&#13;
includes a Geographical Information System (GIS) for the processing of water and other natural&#13;
resource information from various bases (such as water supply, sanitation, agriculture, livestock,&#13;
industry, fisheries, mining, energy, and tourism).&#13;
2.34   The Conseil Superieur de l'Eau (CSE) is being created to act as a steering committee of&#13;
the water resource management process, once its structure is formally approved by the Cabinet of&#13;
Ministers. Representation on the CSE includes: consumers associations, farmers associations, the&#13;
Association des presidents de communautes rurales, the Ministry of Hydraulics, the Ministere de la&#13;
Sante, the Ministere du Developpement Rural, the Ministere du Environnement, the Patronat des&#13;
industriels, the Associations d'eleveurs, the mayors; SONEES (or the new Societe de Patrimoine,&#13;
SONES, after the institutional reform of the water supply subsector), and the Water and Forestry&#13;
Associations.&#13;
2.35   The planned Comite Technique de l'Eau (CTE) will be a consultative committee where all&#13;
water-related ministries, organizations, consumer associations, and other stakeholders engaged in&#13;
water development can discuss common concerns and prepare proposals for new interventions&#13;
(CTE is already functioning as an informal water forum while awaiting its formal establishment).&#13;
2.36   The proposed water resources management strategy would further harmonize the functions&#13;
of these new bodies with existing institutional arrangements with regard to water-related&#13;
responsibilities. It would help establish mechanisms to secure the representation of all parties&#13;
involved in the management and allocation of water resources in the strategy formulation process.&#13;
Further legislation is also needed to cover waste-water management, environmental quality&#13;
standards (particularly with respect to the protection of water resources), drinking water quality&#13;
standards, and the reuse of sewage waters (user rights, property rights, and quality standards for&#13;
treated waste-water to be reused for crop irrigation and aquifer recharge). Developing new&#13;
regulations would be task of the proposed, integrated water resource management strategy for&#13;
managing water resources.&#13;

3. THE SECTOR&#13;
Drinking Water and Sanitation&#13;
Urban Water Supply&#13;
3.1    Outside the Senegal River valley, provision of water is restricted by the lack of adequate&#13;
water resources. Dakar is currently dependent on water drawn from fossil aquifers as far inland as&#13;
Thies, which are already over-exploited and risk being contaminated by salt water intrusion.&#13;
Water for Dakar is also drawn from shallow aquifers in the Niayes area that were traditionally&#13;
used for market gardening. Although SONEES only manages 41 of the 75 towns with more than&#13;
5,000 inhabitants (plus 8 localities with less than 5,000 inhabitants), SONEES' service area covers&#13;
close to 90 percent of the total urban population in Senegal. However, only 54 percent of Senegal' s&#13;
urban population has access to a safe water supply of piped water (para. 1.6).&#13;
3.2    Since 1984 the overall responsibility of the urban water supply sector has been with&#13;
SONEES, a financially independent enterprise now under the administrative supervision of the&#13;
Ministry of Hydraulics. Over the past decade SONEES developed into a capable organization,&#13;
particularly with regard to its technical responsibilities. It implemented the Eleven Centers Water&#13;
Supply Project efficiently, completing it well within the planned time-frame (Project Completion&#13;
Report No. 13833). Compared with similar companies in West Africa, SONEES has kept water&#13;
supply facilities generally in good condition, but its preventive maintenance and sewerage&#13;
operations need to be improved.&#13;
3.3    The responsibilities of SONEES and the Government are laid down in a Contrat-Plan, to&#13;
be renewed every five years. The first Contrat-Plan was concluded on December 31, 1988. A&#13;
second version, which took into account experience and sector developments over the first five-year&#13;
period, covered 1990 to 1994. Results have been mixed. Some of SONEES' water sales targets&#13;
were over-ambitious, and the Government was not able to honor its financial obligations. Physical&#13;
targets for secondary centers were attained.&#13;
3.4    The 1990 sector institutional reform  aimed to strengthen SONEES in operations,&#13;
maintenance, and project implementation. New institutional and financial arrangements were to&#13;
give SONEES full responsibility for the urban water supply and institute measures to ensure that&#13;
the Government and municipalities would pay regularly for the water they consumed. But while&#13;
the first objective was achieved to some extent, the second was not.&#13;
3.5    SONEES departments include finance, data processing, human resources, administration,&#13;
operations, and technical matters. Planning and studies, audit, and management control units&#13;
report directly to the general manager. The Division of Studies and New Works now has qualified&#13;
staff and technical equipment to carry out feasibility studies, do appraisals of projects for small&#13;
centers, implement projects, and introduce preventive maintenance programs.  Management&#13;
positions are staffed with competent Senegalese professionals. Intermediate level staff, while also&#13;
competent, needs further training.&#13;
3.6    To correct the growing imbalance between supply and demand and reduce the enormous&#13;
cost of new fresh-water catchment works, SONEES has embarked on a leakage reduction program,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
an extensive water conservation and waste reduction campaign, and a number of other measures&#13;
(such as a dissuasive, high-tariff block and a public awareness media program). SONEES also&#13;
recently privatized its public standpipes, which resulted in substantial water consumption savings.&#13;
The privatization program  was 97 percent effective, with 2,534 of 2,621 formerly public&#13;
standpipes now being privately managed. A high-priority investment program was also devised to&#13;
increase production capacity to at least cover the demand until the year 2000-including the&#13;
construction of 14 additional boreholes and transmission pipelines to the existing transport system,&#13;
the temporary over-exploitation of the Littoral Nord aquifer, the upgrading of the drinking water&#13;
production plant Ngnith, the construction of a booster pumping station at Carmel on the existing&#13;
Thies-Dakar pipeline, the duplication of the pipeline Thies-Gudoul, the expansion of the&#13;
distribution networks, construction of an additional reservoir at Mamelles, and the addition of fifty&#13;
piezometers to monitor groundwater level and salinity. Germany (KfW) has already financed the&#13;
first, urgent phase of the work-construction of a booster pumping station at Carmel and of ten&#13;
boreholes in the Thies area. It has also supplied the equipment and pipelines needed to connect&#13;
these boreholes to the existing water supply system.&#13;
3.7    Ratio comparisons amongst other water utilities in Subsahara Africa show that the staffing&#13;
of SONEES with 1,459 employees in 1994 for water supply (1,559 employees in total of which&#13;
100 work in the sanitation subsector) is within acceptable norms. In 1994, the actual ratio of&#13;
population served per employee is about 1,075, personnel expenditures per operating revenue ratio&#13;
is about 21.5 percent, personnel expenditures per cash operating cost is about 26, and the number&#13;
of house connections per employee is about 89.&#13;
3.8    Since its creation, SONEES' financial performance has been uneven. It has evolved from a&#13;
poor performance during the 1980's to more encouraging but not sustainable today. As can be seen&#13;
in the table below, water sales have stagnated mainly as a result of serious constraints in water&#13;
production capacity. Also, inadequate tariff increases did not allow SONEES to fully recover&#13;
operating expenses which have been increasing mainly as a result of the costs of fuel, materials and&#13;
supplies for operations and maintenance. Moreover, due to Senegal's overall fiscal situation,&#13;
Government agencies and municipalities have not paid their water bills within the four month&#13;
period agreed under a covenant of the previous project. Faced with cash shortfalls, the company&#13;
has often delayed payment on its debt service obligations to Government and of its electricity bills&#13;
to SENELEC, the State-owned electricity company. The resulting low net income of SONEES has&#13;
therefore limited the financing of new investments from its own resources, which should be at least&#13;
10 percent of SONEES' total gross annual revenues. Financial results for the period from 1990 to&#13;
1993 are shown in Annex 3-1 and summarized below. The 14.4 percent increase in revenues from&#13;
1991 to 1992 was essentially due to a 16 percent increase in the average tariff and a 3.1 percent&#13;
increase in the volume of water sold. This large tariff adjustment was made to reflect cost&#13;
increases over the years, since no significant tariff adjustments had been made since early 1986.&#13;
The increase in volume sold is due to urgency investments in water supply capacity. The balance&#13;
of the revenue increases in 1992 was due to the amortization of subsidies corresponding to the&#13;
transfer from Government to SONEES of fixed assets previously State-owned. The large increase&#13;
in non-operating expenses was due to an exceptional write-off on unpaid receivables, particularly&#13;
including those of the market garden sector, which had been rolled over during many years and&#13;
were finally recognized as non-collectable. The financial situation of SONEES was severely&#13;
affected after the 100 percent devaluation of the CFAF on January, 1994. While Government&#13;
authorized an increase of 30 percent in the water tariffs in April, 1994, this was not sufficient to&#13;
fully offset the increased cost of imported goods and the debt service payment requirements on the&#13;
external debt.&#13;

3.9     SONEES has a commercial double-entry accounting system, which is in accordance with&#13;
sound and internationally recognized accounting principles and practices. Under the previous IDA&#13;
operation, several actions aimed at improving the financial performance of SONEES: the use of&#13;
cost-center accounting and budgetary accounting, making a physical inventory and evaluation of&#13;
the fixed assets previously owned by the Government and passed on SONEES in 1983, improving&#13;
the recording of new investments, and the use of data processing as part of SONEES management&#13;
information system MIS. Audited 1993 accounts were submitted to IDA in August 1994 for&#13;
review. The audit report was qualified due to unexplained differences in the accounts receivable,&#13;
lack of provision for benefits for staff retiring, and the inability of the auditors to certify the value&#13;
of the stocks. It is expected that these items will be dealt with in the report for the period ending&#13;
December 1994.&#13;
3.10    Challenges. The country's fiscal situation has had major a impact on SONEES. Non-&#13;
payment for water consumed by Government and municipal institutions, combined with&#13;
Government's reluctance to increase tariffs, endanger SONEES' solvency. Government has&#13;
therefore agreed to implement a number of corrective measures to redress the problem  of&#13;
Government arrears, high water consumption by public agencies, non-reliable water quality, tariffs&#13;
below cost recovery for water services, potable water used for market gardening, and the lack of a&#13;
safe water supply for the urban poor:&#13;
Arrears. In 1984, legislation was passed requiring Government to settle arrears for&#13;
water consumed and to pay its water bills regularly. But liquidity problems&#13;
prevented many municipalities in particular, from settling their arrears. To lighten&#13;
their charges, public standpipes were privatized. Consumers now pay for their&#13;
water directly, which has resulted in a decrease of about 51 percent in municipal&#13;
water bills. In the framework of the Structural Adjustment Program, the national&#13;
Government had settled its arrears to SONEES and other public enterprises by the&#13;
end of 1990. Arrears among public enterprises, and from these enterprises to the&#13;
Government, were also settled or renegotiated in February 1992. In April 1994 the&#13;
Government signed a new convention to settle its arrears to SONEES as of&#13;
December 31, 1993, which resulted in a net debt of US$3.9 million from SONEES&#13;
to the Government. In June 1994, the mid-term balance was US$1.8 million in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
favor of the Government, not including accounts payable by municipalities and&#13;
public agencies, which amount to US$1.16 million.&#13;
Tariffs. According to the "cahier des clauses et conditions generales", water tariffs&#13;
should be reviewed twice a year (on January I and July 1), using a formula that&#13;
takes into account all price components (operation, renewal, growth, sanitation,&#13;
rural water supply, and taxes). When the formula suggests more than a 2-percent&#13;
increase, SONEES must submit the proposed tariff increase to the Ministry of&#13;
Hydraulics for approval. If no response is received within fifteen days, the increase&#13;
will go into effect automatically. This schedule was followed, however, only in&#13;
1985 and 1986. Tariffs were increased in 1989 by about 21 percent, in 1992 by&#13;
about 12.9 percent (with the exception of the social tariff and tariffs for standpipes&#13;
and agricultural water use), and again in 1994 -following the CFAF devaluation- by&#13;
about 30 percent (Annex 3-2). Tariff policies should support the principle of cost&#13;
recovery for water services. Tariff adjustment formulas should reflect changes in&#13;
costs, inflation, and the exchange rate for local and hard currency. Senegal's&#13;
macroeconomic objectives (presented in a Letter of Intent submitted to the IMF in&#13;
January 1994 and in a Policy Framework Paper agreed upon with the Bank and the&#13;
IMF in July 1994) include increasing energy and utilities prices to reflect current&#13;
production costs more closely.&#13;
Drinking water quality. An ad hoc analysis of drinking water quality showed that,&#13;
in a number of cases in the four secondary cities targeted by the Conmmunity&#13;
Nutrition Project, fecal streptococcus and coliforms were present at the end of the&#13;
distribution system. In most of these cases, no chlorine remained. In Kaolack and&#13;
Ziguinchor, coliforms have been noted at the exit of the water-towers. These&#13;
findings underscore the need for water sector and policy reform to guarantee safe&#13;
and reliable drinking water for the population.&#13;
*    Water Consumption by Public Agencies. A recent study indicated that in 1991&#13;
water losses and wastage amounted to about 47.2 percent of the total volume of&#13;
water billed to public agencies, which corresponded at that time to 15,000 cubic&#13;
meters per day. Stopping 70 percent of these losses is a realistic objective. The&#13;
Government is committed to move rapidly on its new water sector action plan to&#13;
rehabilitate water meters, reduce water leakage, rationalize public administration&#13;
water usage, budget annual public agency water consumption, and schedule&#13;
payment of Government water bills. During negotiations, Government agreed as&#13;
part of its sector policy, to take all necessary measures to implement the water&#13;
sector action plan with time table, acceptable to IDA (Annex 8).&#13;
Market gardening. The practice of using potable water for irrigation in the market&#13;
gardening sector in the Cap Vert area continues. More than 10 percent of SONEES'&#13;
annual production was consumed in 1993 for irrigation. The action plan in order to&#13;
discourage this practice and eventually phase out the use of potable water for&#13;
irrigation is discussed in paras. 3.19 to 3.23.&#13;
*     Water for the urban poor. SONEES has not yet provided the bulk of Dakar's poor&#13;
with access to affordable drinking water, except through public fountains. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
proposed sector and policy reform aims to make safe drinking water available to&#13;
about 460,000 additional poor people in Dakar (paras. 4.17 and 4.31).&#13;
3.11   Rationale for Institutional Reform. Senegal aims at reforming the water supply sector&#13;
institutions to create a regulatory environment conducive to sector growth, to ensure continuity of&#13;
management and rational organization, to encourage the development of human resources, to&#13;
support operation and maintenance improvements, to institute a new tariff policy for better cost&#13;
recovery, and to enforce new increased block tariffs in the market gardening subsector. Although&#13;
the water supply subsector is currently handled by a reasonably efficient parastatal, SONEES,&#13;
private sector participation is required to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. The sector is&#13;
indeed facing two major issues which cannot be addressed by the public company: (a) a medium&#13;
term shortage of production and distribution capacity in the Dakar area requiring heavy immediate&#13;
investments; (b) the future need to have access to large sources of private capital for the future&#13;
large investment program needed to meet the long-term demand for water in the Dakar area (para.&#13;
5.4). Financial viability of the sector, independent from Government, will therefore be an essential&#13;
condition for the development of the sector (para. 5.3). The analysis of various levels of tariff&#13;
increases necessary to achieve financial viability showed that without any private participation, a&#13;
tariff increase of about 6 to 7 percent would be required to reach equilibrium by the end of the year&#13;
2003. The participation of the private sector in the water supply operation would reduce the&#13;
necessary increase for two main reasons. First, progress could be achieved by a professional&#13;
operator in terms of productivity. Secondly, increased managerial autonomy would result in higher&#13;
operational efficiency. In December 1993, the Senegalese Government confirmed its preference for&#13;
entrusting a private company with the task of managing day-to-day operations through an&#13;
affermage contract, while a public holding company will remain in charge of managing the assets&#13;
of the sector. More broadly, privatizing water sector operations fits within the overall Government&#13;
strategy to disengage from production and commnercial activities and to focus on a limited number&#13;
of priority services.&#13;
Urban Sanitation&#13;
3.12   Sanitation installations throughout Senegal are very poor. According to the 1988 census,&#13;
only 13 percent of households are connected to the sewerage system and 40 percent relieve&#13;
themselves outdoors. The percentage of households without any sanitary facilities is 62 percent in&#13;
rural areas and 33 percent in urban areas. The sanitation subsector is hampered by an inadequate&#13;
institutional structure and by insufficient investment. Sanitation sector issues include lack of&#13;
coordination among the actors involved, inadequate financial resources for capital expenditures,&#13;
lack of clarity about the respective boundaries for storm drainage works and on-site sanitation,&#13;
inadequate cost recovery for operating and maintaining subsurface systems (mainly as a result of&#13;
the low sanitation surcharge on drinking water distribution), inadequate individual on-site or&#13;
collective sanitation system coverage of the urban and peri-urban areas, and extensive use of&#13;
shallow wells in areas where sewage can pollute shallow aquifers.&#13;
3.13   Since January 1990, SONEES has operated and maintained sewerage installations on a&#13;
management-contract basis. In centers with sanitation services, SONEES collects a surcharge of&#13;
CFAF 28.90 (about US$0.05) per cubic meter of water sold, but Government continues to service&#13;
the related sewerage sector debt. Only Dakar, Kaolack, Thies, Louga, and Saint Louis have&#13;
standard sewerage systems, but even there the rate of connection is less than 30 percent. Urban&#13;
households not connected to the sewer system generally dispose of wastewater into drainage&#13;
ditches, which adds to unsanitary conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
3.14   The sewerage infrastructure consists of 640 kilometers of main sewers, 200 kilometers of&#13;
stormwater channels and pipes, 40 pumping stations- including four for stormwater and six water&#13;
treatment plants. The investment plan of the Government proposes increasing connections to the&#13;
existing sewer system, building decentralized small-scale treatment plants for the reuse of peri-&#13;
urban municipal wastewater in the Greater Dakar area, constructing a new Rufisque sewerage&#13;
system, preparing sewerage master plans for six riparian centers (to serve a population of 133,570)&#13;
and thirteen secondary centers (serving a population of 600,580). Other secondary cities and 44&#13;
percent of all Senegalese households rely on such independent sanitary facilities as septic tanks&#13;
with sumps or watertight pits.&#13;
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
3.15   Over 4 million Senegalese live in some 12,000 villages and have very limited financial&#13;
means to invest, operate, and maintain water systems. In large parts of Senegal where groundwater&#13;
is situated at great depths (150 to 300 meters), wells and small boreholes equipped with hand&#13;
pumps are impractical and ground water must be extracted by motorized equipment with high&#13;
discharge and held in elevated reservoirs. In 1989, 661 deep boreholes existed, of which 495 were&#13;
well-equipped. The remaining 166 were either not equipped or were equipped only with hand-or&#13;
wind-driven pumps.&#13;
3.16   Large-diameter boreholes equipped with mechanically driven pumps connected to small&#13;
distribution systems are the only feasible solution, but operation and maintenance of these systems&#13;
is not within the scope of the country's villages. The new DEM directorate was given sole&#13;
responsibility for the operation and maintenance of rural water supply systems in December 1993.&#13;
Over the next four years, DEM's workload is expected to more than double with the construction of&#13;
350 new boreholes.&#13;
3.17   Government strategy aims to transfer responsibility for the larger rural water supply&#13;
schemes to the urban sector, while the operation and maintenance for smaller schemes will be&#13;
privatized, gradually transferring responsibility for them to the communities they serve. Village&#13;
committees have been formed to collect contributions from the villagers. At the moment, the&#13;
contributions cover about 90 percent of the cost of fuel. This contribution is to be increased&#13;
gradually to cover the total cost of operations and maintenance. Responsibility for debt service&#13;
will remain for the foreseeable future with the Government, because rural communities are not&#13;
financially strong enough to support these charges. But, in fifteen to twenty years, when normal&#13;
demand will have grown and all presently constructed boreholes will need to be renewed, new&#13;
problems will arise. A proposed study would review the feasibility of increasing the voluntary&#13;
contribution; introducing water tariffs; or imposing Government, municipal, or village taxes.&#13;
3.18   With few regulation latrines in rural areas, excreta is generally deposited outdoors. While&#13;
rural sanitation services in Senegal are hardly adequate, activities in the proposed project to&#13;
improve them are presently limited to including sanitation and health information programs in rural&#13;
water supply projects and constructing pilot VIP latrines. The strategy envisaged for the future&#13;
would be to continue the program to provide villages with latrines and other low-cost sanitation&#13;
systems of proven efficacy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Irrigation in the Dakar and Thies Areas&#13;
3.19   The scarcity of water in Dakar is exacerbated by the fact that SONEES is currently&#13;
delivering potable water for irrigation to market gardens at below cost, encouraging wasteful&#13;
consumption. This practice threatens the sustainability of water resources and requires greater&#13;
volumes of wastewater to be treated. The use of potable water for irrigation in Dakar is difficult to&#13;
defend in view of Dakar's chronic water shortages. In some areas, it deprives the urban poor and&#13;
industry of water for up to 22 hours per day. This was the rationale for the Government to prepare&#13;
an irrigation action plan to phase out the use of drinking water for irrigation (para. 3.23).&#13;
3.20   The Dakar region's limited water production potential puts a limit on the production of&#13;
crops. To prevent the depletion of the shallow aquifers in the Niayes area, which are traditionally&#13;
used for market gardening, Government has established a water quota for horticulture equivalent to&#13;
7 percent of SONEES' production. But in 1993 11 percent of the drinking water production was&#13;
being used for market gardening - 12 percent in the Dakar area and 10 percent in the Thies area.&#13;
From 1985 to 1990, unpaid water bills by the market gardening subsector in the Niayes area&#13;
amnounted to 1.18 billion CFAF; from 1991 to 1993, they amounted to 585 million CFAF. This&#13;
corresponds to the accounts receivable of 759 horticulture consumers, with the 22 largest&#13;
consumers accounting for about half of arrears and the three largest consumers for a quarter. The&#13;
irrigation action plan contains measures to ensure that, after a short transition period (ending&#13;
1995), the bill collection rate and the collection period for accounts receivable of marget gardeners&#13;
become equal to these of other private water consumers. Consumers currently in large arrears may&#13;
be asked to provide equity for the new operating company SdE, thus giving them an incentive to&#13;
pay up, or would be provided with autonomous boreholes.&#13;
3.21   After the devaluation of the CFAF, market gardening became highlv competitive. This&#13;
wvas considered as a window of opportunity to increase the water tariffs to discourage, or even&#13;
phase out entirely, the use of potable water for agricultural purposes. A socio-economic study&#13;
showed that an average tariff increase applied to the market gardening sector by 45 percent, or up&#13;
to 100 CFAF per cubic meter on average (in 1995 francs), would be affordable by the majority of&#13;
low-income gardeners. On that basis, and as part of the irrigation action plan, Government&#13;
therefore committed itself to impose as from July 1, 1995, a new, increasing block-rate structure&#13;
for market gardening water consumption, and to dissuade enterprises from continuing market&#13;
gardening that is not profitable without a water subsidy. Furthermore, a training and education&#13;
program is envisaged by Government, to promote the use of new and more efficient irrigation&#13;
techniques to achieve water savings and reduce wastages.&#13;
3.22   Even with the new tariff increase, the water tariff currently charged to market gardeners&#13;
remains well below the average operational cost per cubic meter of production of potable water for&#13;
urban use. The irrigation action plan contains a gradual increase of the water tariff charged to the&#13;
market gardening sector, with the aim of charging the opportunity cost of potable water once the&#13;
solution to the long-term water demand in the Dakar area is operational (para. 7.12). In the mean&#13;
time, linked with the provision of alternative, less costly water (treated wastewater) being made&#13;
available to market gardeners by the end of 1997 (paras. 2.10 and 4.18), as of January 1, 1998,&#13;
average tariff will be increased to 160 CFAF per cubic meters (in real terms, in 1995 francs),&#13;
which corresponds to the marginal cost of operations at the point of water supply in the Niayes.&#13;
3.23   During negotiations, Government agreed, as part of its sector policy, to take all necessary&#13;
measures to implement the irrigation action plan with time table, acceptable to IDA (Annex 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Environment and Health&#13;
3.24   Environmental health hazards-brought on by contaminated drinking water, lack of access&#13;
to clean water, and unreliability of water supply-can cause disease and death. Water is necessary&#13;
for drinking, cooking, personal hygiene, and the maintenance of hygienic living conditions, that&#13;
prevent disease.&#13;
3.25   Established standards for drinking water are needed to monitor the quality of treated water&#13;
and to estimate potential health hazards. Insufficient treatment (due to shortages of chlorine,&#13;
intermittent water supply, break-down of equipment, and leakages) leads to contamination of the&#13;
water supply. In well-operated and well-maintained water treatment plants and distribution&#13;
systems, moreover, leakages can be kept as low as 2 to 5 percent. In Senegal, the results of water&#13;
quality assessments are usually skewed by water tested from the capital and other big cities, which&#13;
have generally better-quality water. While no national drinking water quality standards have yet&#13;
been developed, the WHO drinking water quality guidelines are followed in Senegal.&#13;
3.26   Malaria. The incidence of malaria can be used as an indicator for the presence of stagnant&#13;
water that is a threat to human health. In the Pikine neighborhood of Dakar, for instance, the&#13;
malaria incidence was higher for those living near a marsh where Anopheles mosquito breeding-&#13;
sites were located. A one-year study of 343 schoolchildren showed that, during the period of&#13;
maximum transmission, malaria was responsible for 36 percent of school absences for medical&#13;
reasons. Another study showed that 34 percent of fevers showing up at Dakar hospitals were due&#13;
to malaria, as opposed to 23 percent of fevers in rural Casamance.&#13;
3.27   Sanitation. The spread of fecal contamination is a constant threat to public health,&#13;
primarily where inadequate and unsanitary disposal of excreta, results in the pollution of both soil&#13;
and drinking water. Infections and epidemics attributable to fecal matter cause both death and&#13;
disability. The absence of a sanitation strategy and coordination among the various agencies&#13;
responsible for waste disposal and the shortage of resources available for sewerage in Senegal,&#13;
have both added to the country's environmental and health problems.&#13;
3.28   Public awareness and participation. There is presently little information provided to the&#13;
general public regarding water resources and quality and projections for the future. Yet public&#13;
awareness and community management are necessary to improve the effectiveness of&#13;
environmental and health control in Dakar. Currently, thousands throw refuse into drainage&#13;
canals. No city-and especially one with small crews and limited resources-would be able to keep&#13;
these canals clear without the public's cooperation. An education and demand management&#13;
program is therefore essential to improve water use and sanitation practices in Senegal. A first step&#13;
int this direction will be implemented by the AGETIP in the context of the Community Nutrition&#13;
Project (para. 4.11).&#13;
Emerging Policy&#13;
3.29   Government's emerging water sector policy aims to provide affordable access to potable&#13;
water and adequate sanitation facilities to all urban and agglomerated rural populations and, at the&#13;
same time to reduce the dependency of the sector on the Government's budget. Accordingly, the&#13;
Government's sector policy (Annex 8 has the following objectives:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
*    In the area of urban water supply, it aims to satisfy the total urban demand by the&#13;
year 2000 and to reduce the cost of potable water by giving full responsibility for&#13;
managing the subsector to an autonomous, financially independent enterprise. An&#13;
institutional reform to be completed by the end of 1995 includes the creation of an&#13;
asset holding agency SONES (Societe Nationale des Eaux du Senegal) and a private&#13;
operating company SdE (Societe d'Exploitation) (para 3.11). Further institutional&#13;
reforms included defining the functional relationships between the state, SONES,&#13;
and the SdE and establishing terms of reference and financial projections for needed&#13;
investments and operating costs. Financed by charges paid by the SdE and by&#13;
external resources, SONES will program and execute investments it will own. The&#13;
SdE will be private, owned by a technical, professional, majority partner (51&#13;
percent) and private Senegalese minority partners (49 percent). The public and staff&#13;
of the former SONEES will be allowed to buy shares in SdE.&#13;
*    In the area of rural water supply, it aims to make available 35 liters per capita a day&#13;
by the year 2000 to all rural households. Users are to be responsible for generating&#13;
funds to cover operations and maintenance. No cost recovery for investments is&#13;
envisaged in the short term. Institutional reform will give the responsibility for&#13;
planning and implementation of projects to DHA and privatize DEM, which is to&#13;
operate and maintain the system.&#13;
*    In the area of urban sanitation, it aims to set up by December 31, 1995-in&#13;
conjunction with the institutional reform of the urban water supply sector-an&#13;
autonomous national sanitation office (Office National d'Assainissement, ONAS) in&#13;
charge of managing and developing the existing collective sanitation infrastructure&#13;
and developing and promoting individual sanitation systems.  DHA is to retain&#13;
overall responsibility for setting policy, doing long-term planning, and implementing&#13;
the investment program.&#13;
As a condition of Board presentation, Government submitted to IDA the signed letter of Sector&#13;
Policy, satisfactory to IDA. (para. 8.2)&#13;
IDA Involvement&#13;
3.30   Lessons from previous IDA involvement. Past  IDA-financcd   projects  have   been&#13;
instrunental in Senegal's water sector reorganization and the establishment of SONEES. During&#13;
the 1970s, the Government, IDA, and the Caisse francaise de developpement maintained a&#13;
continuing dialogue regarding institutional and sector reform that resulted in IDA's first project in&#13;
the sector, the Senegal Engineering Project (Credit S23-SE, approved in April 1979 and closed on&#13;
December 31, 1984). This credit provided funds for the preliminary studies needed for sector&#13;
reorganization, training, financial and tariff reform, and the technical aspects of the Eleven Centers&#13;
Water Supply Project (Cr. 1554 - SE). IDA also assisted in the preparation of a sector report,&#13;
completed in May 1990, which served as a basis for a donors' meeting.&#13;
3.31   The Eleven Centers Water Supply Project helped transform a Governnent Department into&#13;
a parastatal, SONEES, an agency that is technically effective and has excellent procurement&#13;
performance. Its bidding was done on schedule, and its contracts were concluded without problems&#13;
and below appraisal cost. Continuing issues that were not resolved, but which are specifically&#13;
addressed in the proposed project, included (paras 3.10 and 3.12):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
*    Insufficient autonomy for SONEES.&#13;
*    Irregular payment of water bills by Government agencies.&#13;
*    Lack of a tariff policy that will ensure long-term financial viability.&#13;
*    Lack of attention to and investment in sanitation infrastructure.&#13;
IDA delayed the proposed project, which was originally appraised in 1991, because of lack of&#13;
progress in implementing institutional and financial reforms. A consensus has now been reached&#13;
with Govermment on sector reform, building upon and extending successful western Africa&#13;
experiences reviewed in the 1994 World Development Report: e.g. Guinea, where water supply is&#13;
owned by a state enterprise and operations leased to a private operating company since 1989; and&#13;
CMte d'Ivoire, where an urban water supply concession was given to a private consortium, which&#13;
receives no operating subsidies and self-finances investments. The lessons of the Lima and Buenos&#13;
Aires operations have also been taken into consideration.&#13;
3.32   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed operation fits within the overall Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy presented at the Board on February 16, 1995. Senegal is maintaining the&#13;
momentum on the implementation of its reform program, allowing IDA to increase commitrnents in&#13;
FY95 to reflect its satisfaction. As the CAS emphasized the need for change with both the power&#13;
and water sectors this operation supports the Govermment's efforts to redefine and focus its role&#13;
away from commercial activities and to improve the competitiveness of the economy. On the water&#13;
side, continued IDA support is necessary to deepen sector reform, ensure financial discipline&#13;
through a private operating company, and help consolidate cofinancing. On the sanitation side,&#13;
IDA support will help define a strategy and investments to address the growing peri-urban low-&#13;
income population. The proposed operation is part of a comprehensive, long-term water sector&#13;
development strategy to improve the competitiveness of the economy by reducing the cost of inputs&#13;
and to reduce poverty through safe water and sanitation for low-income households.&#13;
4. THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
4.1    Long-term development of Senegal's water sector began with the Eleven Centers Water&#13;
Supply Project (closed in 1993) which helped to establish SONEES, a competent parastatal. A&#13;
second project aims to deepen these institutional reforms and to make critical investments so that&#13;
Senegal can meet its demand for safe water in the year 2000. This is the proposed project.&#13;
Ensuring long-term sustainability of the sector, will require a future operation. The overall&#13;
development objectives of the proposed project are to address: (a) sustainabilUty, by improving&#13;
management, pricing, and cost recovery and reducing Government subsidy for industrial, domestic&#13;
and irrigation water; (b) poverty alleviation and health, by increasing access to safe potable water&#13;
and adequate and more affordable sanitation for the urban poor; and, (c) private sector&#13;
participation, by engaging a private company to manage urban water supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
4.2    Specific project objectives are:&#13;
*  Water resource management. to formulate an integrated, multisectoral policy and&#13;
strategy for the shared use of water by households, industry, and agriculture that&#13;
would also be coordinated with future development projects in these sectors.&#13;
* Institutional capacity building. to strengthen the MH's capacity to monitor aquifer&#13;
exploitation, to strengthen the newly established SONES, for policy and strategy, to&#13;
strengthen the newly established ONAS and develop a strategy for urban and peri-&#13;
urban sanitation improvement.&#13;
* Urban water production and distribution. to reduce leakages in the Greater Dakar&#13;
water distribution system (from the current estimated 27 to 15 percent), and to&#13;
increase the Dakar region's water production capacity by 34 percent (from the current&#13;
production capacity of 202,000 to 266,000 m3 per day).&#13;
* Urban sanitation. to increase the effectiveness of the existing Dakar sewerage&#13;
system, develop sanitation in secondary towns, and promote the reuse of treated&#13;
municipal wastewater for irrigation.&#13;
Description&#13;
4.3    The proposed project is sector-wide in scope and promotes sector strategy development,&#13;
institutional capacity building, and investment programs. It is supported by key donors involved in&#13;
the water sector. To create more sustainable development, institutional reform and the design of&#13;
investments are coupled with the building of capacity in the newly established entities SGPRE,&#13;
SONES, SdE, and ONAS.&#13;
4.4    The proposed project includes the following features:&#13;
* Discrete Implementation Phases. The proposed implementation schedule is designed&#13;
in three discrete, free-standing phases designed to reflect donor financing&#13;
commitments more realistically and to permit a gradual approach to the staging of&#13;
large civil works.&#13;
*  Private operator targets.  As an incentive for the private operator to renew&#13;
investments and limit water losses, nonrevenue water performance targets are included&#13;
m the contractual agreement.&#13;
* Sector financial equilibrium. To ensure long-term sustainability and free up fiscal&#13;
resources for other sectors, a specific timeframe is stipulated for reaching cash-flow&#13;
equilibrium.&#13;
* Commercial loan. To cover the temporary cash flow shortfall of the sector until such&#13;
equilibrium is reached, the project includes a commercial loan from a local and&#13;
regional bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
* World Bank's water policy. The proposed operation builds upon the principles of the&#13;
Bank's stated 1993 Water Sector Policy, namely the environmentally sustainable use&#13;
of water resources through a set of coherent measures in the regulatory (water demand&#13;
management), institutional (privatization and decentralization) and economic (cost&#13;
recovery) areas.&#13;
4.5    The Project contains components in institutional capacity building (particularly in water&#13;
resource management, increasing the water supply to urban and pen'-urban areas improving&#13;
sanitation facilities in urban and peri-urban areas. About 65 percent of all investments would go to&#13;
increase water production transport to greater Dakar; about 15 percent would go to reduce&#13;
leakages in the water distribution network and improve the accessibility to a safe water supply; the&#13;
remaining 20 percent would go to support water resource management, urban sanitation and&#13;
capacity building. A list of all project components is shown in Annex 6-5.&#13;
Component A: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building&#13;
4.6    This component (base cost US$8.1 million) consists of three subcomponents: (a) in water&#13;
resource management, support Ministry of Hydraulics and SPGRE, prepare a national water&#13;
resource management strategy and prepare future projects, (b) in potable water, support the newly&#13;
created SONES in managing sector policy, including auditing and cost accounting; and (c) in&#13;
sanitation, support the newly created ONAS in the formulation of a national strategy for sanitation&#13;
in urban and peri-urban areas (para. 3.29).&#13;
4.7    The water resource management subcomponent supports a broad-based, intersectoral and&#13;
participatory process for developing a country-wide strategy in water resource management. It&#13;
also supports related water resource management project preparation which would be required to&#13;
attract investments for the long-term water supply solution of the Dakar region. The water&#13;
resource management process will build on earlier studies and project proposals, which have been&#13;
supported by UNDP and other donors. It will be launched with a stakeholder workshop, supported&#13;
by EDI, to be held soon after project effectiveness. To set in motion this first workshop, the&#13;
following steps are planned: (a) prepare terms of reference for the appointment of the members of&#13;
the CSE; (b) appoint short-term consultants to plan and implement the workshop, identify key&#13;
stakeholders at the national, regional and local levels and help draft the water resource management&#13;
objectives; (c) outline an information and dissemination program; (d) prepare a draft water&#13;
resource management strategy document; and (e) set up a mechanism to monitor the water&#13;
resource management process after the launching workshop.&#13;
4.8    To ensure that the improvements in the potable water supply sector and water resource&#13;
management efforts are closely coordinated, the water resource management activities will be&#13;
linked to the project's phases, as follows: Phase I will set the process in motion, build consensus&#13;
and prepare the draft strategy.  Phase II will begin implementation of the water resource&#13;
management strategy, so that it prepares the ground for the long-term water supply solution&#13;
proposed for Greater Dakar (para 2.19). The water resource management process will also build&#13;
upon and coordinate the activities related to the Water Master Plan for Greater Dakar and the&#13;
ongoing NEAP process.&#13;
4.9    The first stakeholder workshop is planned for March 1996 and would launch the water&#13;
resource management process. Its aims are: (a) to create greater awareness among key users and&#13;
decision makers of the physical, social, economic and environmental interdependencies involved in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
water resources; (b) to improve the understanding of formulating a comprehensive, country-wide&#13;
strategy; (c) to develop the foundations for establishing a shared vision of water resources and&#13;
uses; and (d) to prepare recommendations to underpin the national strategy. The workshop should&#13;
be attended by representatives from related sector ministries, public service, the private sector,&#13;
NGOs, donors, and other stakeholders concerned with or having an interest in water resources&#13;
development. At appraisal, agreement was reached on the nature and timing of the launching&#13;
workshop for the water resource management strategy.&#13;
4.10   The water resource management subcomponent supports specific hydrological studies,&#13;
including the Lac de Guiers, the revitalization of the Vallees Fossiles. and the study of the&#13;
Maestrichtian aquifer. In addition, (a) technical advisory services will be provided to MH ir. the&#13;
subject area of water resource management, and (b) training in the use of PC-based groundwater&#13;
modelling, will be given to key staff of SGPRE, who are preparing a special groundwater control&#13;
program to monitor saline water movements and the ground water level in water catchment areas.&#13;
(para 7.12)&#13;
4.11   The potable water institutional capacity building subcomponent would support and help&#13;
further develop the newly created SONES (a) to develop and manage the national water sector&#13;
policy, (b) to control the SdE, and (c) to develop capacity in financial management, cost accounting&#13;
and maintenance auditing. The project would provide (a) technical, advisory services in these&#13;
areas., and (b) organization of short and long-term training programs for the benefit of SONES&#13;
staff, including participation in specialized conferences and technical visits to other water utilities.&#13;
In addition, a public health education and demand management campaign throughout Senegal is&#13;
included in the project dealing with issues as: (i) proper use of a clear and safe water; (ii) cost of&#13;
access to safe water (use water wisely); and (iii) basic sanitary and healthy behaviors (para 3.28).&#13;
This program will use the same approach as the Information, Education and Coordination (IEC)&#13;
program developed for the Community Nutrition Project (Cr. 2723-SE) implemented by the&#13;
AGETIP. Coordination between the two programs will be ensured.&#13;
4.12   The sanitation institutional capacity building subcomponent would support the newly&#13;
created ONAS (para. 3.29) to prepare and implement a sustainable, urban sanitation development&#13;
strategy. The proposed project would provide technical, advisory services in the following areas:&#13;
(a) conducting institutional, technical and financial studies, including inter alia a willingness to pay&#13;
study (para. 4.31); (b) providing management assistance and modernization of financial&#13;
management and cost recovery; (c) designing a sector investment and maintenance program for&#13;
Dakar and secondary cities to include a menu of technological options; and, (d) developing a public&#13;
information and stakeholder consultation process to include non-governmental organizations. The&#13;
strengthening of the institutional, financial and technological framework of ONAS represents a&#13;
number of challenges, including the improved access to sustainable sanitation services to all&#13;
segments of the urban population. A launching workshop will be organized with the support of&#13;
GREA for early 1996 to support the formulation of the national urban sanitation strategy (Annex&#13;
4). In addition the proposed project would provide the organization of short and long-term&#13;
training programs for the benefit of ONAS staff, including participation in specialized conferences&#13;
and technical visits to other urban sanitation projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
Component B: Urban Water Supply&#13;
4.13   This component (base cost US$207.5 million) consists of three subcomponents:  (a)&#13;
drinking water production (base cost: US$162.5 million); (b) water supply and distribution (base&#13;
cost US$29.7 million); and (c) logistic support (base cost US$15.3 million). The increase of water&#13;
supply capacity to Dakar and its surroundings from 202,000 to 266,000 cubic meters per day, to&#13;
meet the short-term demand, is summarized in the table 4.1.&#13;

4.14   The drinking water production component comprises the following subcomponents: (i) the&#13;
increase of production capacity for Dakar and its pen'-urban areas, (ii) the transport of the&#13;
additional volume to the Dakar area; and (iii) the optimization of water supply operations. The&#13;
project supports:&#13;
(a)   carrying out of water treatment works to increase the capacity of the existing&#13;
Ngiith intake and treatment works from 39,000 to 64,000 cubic meters per day;&#13;
(b)   constructing 11 boreholes in the Littoral Nord including the related pipework&#13;
linking them to the existing transmission system, for an additional production&#13;
capacity of 35,000 cubic meters per day;&#13;
(c)   installing piezometers to monitor the Littoral Nord groundwater table;&#13;
(d)   constructing about 103 km of buried transmission main of 1000 mm diameter&#13;
between Ngnith and Thies;&#13;
(e)   constructing about 55 km of buried transmission main of 1,200 mm diameter&#13;
between Thies and Point B;&#13;
(f)   constructing a 25,000 cubic meters reservoir at Mamelles, increasing the storage&#13;
capacity from 10,000 cubic meters to 35,000 cubic meters;&#13;
(g)   constructing 2 boreholes near Thies including the related pipework linking them to&#13;
the existing transmission system, for an additional production capacity of 4,000&#13;
cubic meters per day;&#13;
(h)   installing a remote control and management system to optimize operation of the&#13;
production and transmission system of the Dakar water supply.&#13;
4.15   The water supply distribution component comprises the following subcomponents: (i) the&#13;
reduction of water losses; (ii) the installation of low income house connections and public&#13;
standpipes; and (iii) the extension of the distribution network. The project supports:&#13;
(a)   reducing leakages in the secondary distribution network in the Dakar area, by&#13;
rehabilitating about 100 km pipe of equivalent diameter (100 mm) and about&#13;
30,000 connections;&#13;
(b)   expanding the existing water distribution network following an indicative five-year&#13;
masterplan prepared by SONES, to be updated yearly;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
(c)  installing about 34,000 low-income house connections and 200 standpipes in the&#13;
Dakar region;&#13;
(d)  installing large diameter water meters in the primary distribution system of the&#13;
Dakar region.&#13;
4.16   The subcomponent logistical support, including engineering, studies and supervision&#13;
comprises:&#13;
(a)   provision of technical advisory services to SONES in the carrying out of final&#13;
studies, preparation of bid documents, and supervision of works;&#13;
(b)   preparation of the future water sector project (long-term solution of water supply&#13;
to Dakar) including designing and operating a pilot plant as model for a new&#13;
treatment plant; and, conducting an environmental impact study for the said&#13;
treatment plant;&#13;
(c)   conducting maintenance and financial audits of SdE for the period covering 1996-&#13;
2000;&#13;
(d)   provision of laboratory equipment for water quality control and computer&#13;
equipment and software for modernization of management;&#13;
(e)   rehabilitation of office facilities for SONES.&#13;
4.17   An important feature of the proposed project is to increase accessibility to safe drinking&#13;
water for the urban poor (Annex 4-2). Recommendations of a willingness to pay/affordability&#13;
study will serve as a basis for defining priority areas for extending and installing low-income house&#13;
connections and public standpipes (para. 4.31). Recently the possibility was offered by SONEES&#13;
to pay water bills in instalments, which would free households from the obligation to pay a major&#13;
amount (on average, US$8-10 every two months) in a single payment. A major constraint in&#13;
providing the peri-urban areas with safe drinking water is the high cost of connections compared to&#13;
the low incomes of the population. Therefore, it is necessary to allocate some subventions for their&#13;
installation, as provided in this component. Public standpipes will be considered in less densely&#13;
populated areas and in urban poor fringe areas. This increased accessibility to safe piped drinking&#13;
water will go along with lower costs for households and a positive impact on health and hygiene.&#13;
Component C: Urban Sanitation&#13;
4.18   To improve sanitation in urban and peri-urban areas and to deal with increased amounts of&#13;
sewage as a result of the increased drinking water supply of the proposed project, this component&#13;
(base cost US$32.0 million) comprises:&#13;
* Dakar region&#13;
(a) carrying out of works to increase with about 25 percent the connections to the&#13;
existing sewer system in Dakar (10,000 new connections are planned);&#13;
(b) carrying out of works related to the treatment and reuse of periurban municipal&#13;
waste waters in peri-urban areas of Dakar; the project will support the equipment&#13;
of the Camberene wastewater treatment plant with tertiary treatment facilities and&#13;
the construction of three small-scale decentralized wastewater treatment plants.&#13;
* Secondary towns and riparian centers&#13;

4.19   Two criteria will be used to determine the locality of the planned 10,000 new connections&#13;
to the existing sewer system in the Greater Dakar area: first, the willingness to pay of the&#13;
population for a sustainable sanitation service (para. 4.31); second, environmental, the fact that in&#13;
some urban areas the groundwater level is close to the surface, which makes the application of on-&#13;
site sanitation and latrines not feasible. The willingness to pay study for sanitation services will be&#13;
integrated in the planned study for water supply services (para. 4.17).&#13;
Project Preparation&#13;
4.20   The proposed project is a result of a continuing dialogue between the Government,&#13;
SONEES, IDA, and other interested donors (France (CFD), Germany (KfW), BEI and BOAD)&#13;
regarding how to develop Senegal's water sector, and to finance SONEES' investment plan. The&#13;
project was prepared by SONEES, with the assistance of consultants, under the Eleven Centers&#13;
Water Supply Project (Cr 1554-SE)&#13;
4.21   The project was first appraised in April 1991 and focused on an interim solution to provide&#13;
water to the Dakar area, SONEES' major problem. Final agreement was not reached with the&#13;
Government of Senegal on a number of issues (paras 3.10 and 3.23), which were finally resolved&#13;
and consensus reached during the February 1995 appraisal. In the interim, a hydrogeological study&#13;
was conducted. It was completed in 1992, and demonstrated that the aquifer of the Littoral Nord&#13;
could be temporarily overexploited for a period of up to ten years without serious environmental&#13;
consequences.&#13;
4.22   Since 1991, Germany (KfW) has been financing the first (high priority) stage of the Dakar&#13;
water supply program, which has been implemented. This stage covered the construction of ten&#13;
boreholes near Pout, the piping system linking them to the Thies-Dakar transmission main, and a&#13;
booster pumping station in Carmel. Subprojects in secondary centers include: AEP Petite C6te&#13;
(financed by France (CFD)), AEP Six Centres (financed by Germany (KfW)), and AEP Huit&#13;
Centres (financed by Japan (JICA)). Feasibility studies for the Dakar water supply component&#13;
have been completed. Final design studies and the preparation of bidding documents, financed by&#13;
France (CFD), started in June 1994 and are expected to be ready in mid-1995.&#13;
Studies and PPF&#13;
4.23   An IDA advance (P 864-0 SE) to the Government of Senegal for US$820,000 was&#13;
approved to finance studies on the actualization of recommendations from the environmental&#13;
impact study of August 1990, an institutional and financial and economic feasibility study of the&#13;
long-term solution for water supply to the Dakar/Cap Vert region's (Canal du Cayor), a study of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
institutional reform in the urban sanitation subsector, consultant services for the evaluation of bids&#13;
to establish and run the private operating company, training in project planning and management,&#13;
improving the local ability to audit maintenance and to select appropriate water supply&#13;
technologies, and support for Senegalese staff training missions to other water utilities. A second&#13;
IDA advance (P 864-1 SE) to the Government of Senegal for US$1,180,000 was approved on May&#13;
30, 1995 to support the implementation of the institutional reform of the urban water supply&#13;
subsector (para. 3.29), including financial studies, the study of staffing of SONES, assistance to&#13;
Government for bid evaluation and contract negotiation of the SdE (para. 4.37), the willingness to&#13;
pay study (paras. 4.17 and 4.19), and capacity building workshops for SONES, and to support the&#13;
implementation of the institutional reform of the urban sanitation subsector (para. 3.29).&#13;
Donor Coordination&#13;
4.24   Two donor meetings were held, the first in December 1994 and the second in March 1995.&#13;
The Government prepared a report on institutional reform of the urban water subsector, a report&#13;
summarizing the proposed investment plan, and a strategy for Senegal's water sector from 1994 to&#13;
2000. The reports were distributed to the donors community in November 1994 and are included&#13;
in the project file. These donors meetings allowed the financing gap of the first phase of the&#13;
proposed project to be bridged. France (CFD), Germany (KfW) and EIB are to participate in&#13;
negotiations. The financing gap of US$20.5 million relates to phases II and III of the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
Client consultation&#13;
4.25   During the preparation of the project, a series of workshops were organized to ensure there&#13;
was extensive and systematic client consultation on the central features of the project, namely:&#13;
pricing, privatization options, irrigation versus industrial and human consumption, water resource&#13;
management, etc. With the assistance of EDI and GREA, further client consultation workshops&#13;
will be held before credit effectiveness and during implementation.&#13;
4.26   During project preparation in Spring 1994, an IDA-financed fact-finding mission studied&#13;
institutional reforms in C6te d'Ivoire, Guinea and the Gambia. All parties (representatives of the&#13;
Government, Ministries, SONEES, and the unions) concemed in the reform process, discussed&#13;
conclusions and recommendations from this mission at a workshop in Saly Portudal, Senegal, in&#13;
July 1994&#13;
4.27   Workshop on communication of water sector reforms. A workshop will be organized in&#13;
December 1995 to help the Government of Senegal develop an appropriate strategy to&#13;
communicate effectively the objectives of the reform process to the general public. The experience&#13;
of other African countries which have already implemented similar reforms will be studied in order&#13;
to draw lessons from the successes and failures of the different communication policies which they&#13;
adopted. Communication experts from Senegal, from other African countries and public relation&#13;
specialists working for some of the best known professional operators will be called upon to give&#13;
advise on the elaboration of a communication strategy adapted to the specific environment of&#13;
Senegal. The success of such a communication strategy is indeed crucial to dispel misconceptions,&#13;
increase support for the reform process and ultimately enable and motivate the public to exert&#13;
pressure on the authorities to ensure that the reform process stays on track.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
4.28   This workshop will be planned and delivered in partnership with the Government of&#13;
Senegal. It will be prepared by EDI with support from the External Affairs Unit of the African&#13;
Region (AFREA). It will be the first in a series of workshops prior to credit effectiveness, to assist&#13;
Senegal in the implementation of the reforms. A panel of specialists in communication will&#13;
intervene to help formulate practical and immediately implementable recommendations. The&#13;
discussions will be based on a survey of the public's attitude toward the reforms, carried out&#13;
shortly before the workshop. The main objectives of the workshop are: (i) to inform the&#13;
participants of the reforms' background, their content and intended impact; (ii) to give participants&#13;
the opportunity of exchanging views on the issues and challenges of the reforms and the way to&#13;
communicate them to the public; (iii) to inform them of experiences outside Senegal; and (iv) to&#13;
enable the participants to identify target groups among the public and to define the respective roles&#13;
of the various stakeholders.&#13;
4.29   Workshop on the actors' functions and roles. Sustainable reform of the urban water&#13;
supply sector is vital to the success of the water sector project and requires a complex relationship&#13;
between the State, SONES and the SdE. The main objective of this workshop is to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of the reform of the water supply sector. It will therefore (a) clarify the&#13;
responsibilities, roles and tasks of the newly created SONES; and (b) define the scope of the&#13;
relationship between the three actors : the State, the SONES and the SdE. Finally, the workshop&#13;
will address the issue of the private sector development, especially the infrastructure use. This&#13;
workshop is planned for December 1995 after the establishment of the SdE.&#13;
4.30   Selection of appropriate water treatment techniques. This workshop will be the final in&#13;
the series of workshops aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the water sector reform. It is&#13;
planned for January 1996 and aims at: (a) to improve the awareness of the participants to the&#13;
available technologies in water management and treatment, and (b) to establish a conceptual design&#13;
for the future pilot plant to prepare the future investment program (para 4.16). This workshop will&#13;
contribute to the selection of appropriate water treatment techniques adapted to local conditions, in&#13;
preparation of a future water production plant within the context of the long-term water supply of&#13;
Dakar.&#13;
4.31   Finally, Government will undertake a study in collaboration with GREA to determine the&#13;
population's willingness to pay/affordability of water supply and sanitation services in 1995. This&#13;
study will serve as the basis on which recommendations will be formulated for the installation of&#13;
low income house connections and connections to the sewer system in Greater Dakar (paras. 4.17&#13;
and 4.19)&#13;
Establishment of SONES&#13;
4.32   The law implementing the institutional reform of the urban water supply sector was passed&#13;
on March 24, 1995. The new asset holding company, SONES, is a national company. It will&#13;
accordingly be governed by Law No. 90-07 of June 26, 1990, on supervision of parapublic sector&#13;
enterprises. This status was adjusted in order to give SONES the autonomy necessary to ensure&#13;
total synergy with the future operator. It was agreed that SONES, who would control the lease&#13;
contract, should be effective and efficient, strong in competence but lean in staffing, and have&#13;
credible autonomy (para. 5.18).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Establishment of the SdE&#13;
4.33   Role of the State. The success of the institutional reform of the urban water sector in&#13;
Senegal will depend on the state's ability to limit its role to defining strategy for the water sector,&#13;
the country's ability to form a small, competent holding company to manage sector assets, and the&#13;
efficiency of the private operating company's technical and commercial management (Annex 4-3).&#13;
Lessons learned from similar institutional reforms indicate that unless responsibilities are clearly&#13;
defined between the state, SONES and SdE, the sustainability of the reform will suffer from&#13;
tensions between stakeholders (Annex 4-4). The parties involved in urban water supply following&#13;
the institutional reformn of this subsector will be three in number: the State, SONES and SdE. The&#13;
relations between these parties will be both legal and functional in nature (Annex 4-3). In Annex&#13;
4-4, a matrix of SONES and SdE responsibilities is shown.&#13;
4.34   Transfer of stafffrom previous SONEES. During the Parliamentary discussions preceding&#13;
the passage of the law at the National Assembly which authorized the creation of SONES, the&#13;
deputies requested Government's commitment to guarantee employment of SONEES' current&#13;
pernanent staff (excluding fixed-term and temporary staff) (para. 3.7). An agreement was reached&#13;
between Government and the unions, that the 1559 staff members of SONEES (situation as per of&#13;
December 31, 1994) would be divided up among the three new entities in the following way:&#13;
&#149; SONES:  About 100 staff members, with totalled personnel expenditure not exceeding ten&#13;
percent of the SONEES' personnel expenditure (para. 4.32);&#13;
&#149; ONAS:   100 staff members, currently working in the sanitation sector (para. 3.29);&#13;
* SdE:     The remaining 1359 staff members.&#13;
Among the staff to be taken over by the SdE, 54 staff members will have retired by the end of&#13;
1995, and it is estimated that 430 staff members will be retiring by the year 2004. In December&#13;
1994, Senegal has adopted a new law amending article 47 of the labor code, allowing any private&#13;
enterprise in Senegal, to layoff personmel for economic reasons. This would allow the SdE the&#13;
necessary flexibility to build an effective and efficient utility.&#13;
4.35   An overview of technical and financial objectives of the management-lease contract which&#13;
includes water quality, level of service standards sought, levels of flow, levels of leakage, and&#13;
credible target values is given in Annex 4-4. Contractually binding performance targets for non-&#13;
revenue water will be imposed on the private operator whose remuneration serves as an incentive to&#13;
limit wastage and water losses, which would internalize the incentive to use existing capacity more&#13;
efficiently (Annex 4-5). This is linked to making the private operator responsible for renewing&#13;
investments in the distribution network (at a contractual rate of 17 km pipe of equivalent diameter&#13;
100 mm per year and 6,000 house connections), thus securing the funding of these investments&#13;
(para. 6.2). As SdE has a direct financial interest in reducing water losses, SdE will be closely&#13;
associated with the design, the bid evaluation and the supervision of the rehabilitation component&#13;
of the distribution network (para 4.17).&#13;
4.36   Selection of the private professional partner for the SdE. The following selection&#13;
procedure is being applied: prequalification of private operator candidates, information day on&#13;
draft tender documents and on key features of Government/SONES/SdE relations, organized by the&#13;
Borrower for prequalified private operators candidates; and launching of the call for bids following&#13;
a two-stage bidding procedure. The contract will be awarded based on IDA Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents, to the successful bidder whose second stage bid has been determined to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
substantially responsive and has been determined as the lowest evaluated bid. Credit effectiveness&#13;
will be subject to the establishment of SdE, under the terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, and&#13;
the Government having entered into the affermage contract with SdE and the concession contract&#13;
with SONES, both under the terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA (paras. 5.19 and 8.3(b)).&#13;
4.37   Stakeholder Participation. As part of the process for selection of the professional partner&#13;
for the new private operating company, a prebid conference, during which prequalified firms were&#13;
invited to comment on the draft bidding documents, was held in Dakar on May 11 and 12, 1995.&#13;
This meeting provided an opportunity for the key Senegalese sector actors and the potential bidders&#13;
to engage in a frank exchange on a number of issues. In addition to the selection process itself,&#13;
discussions revolved around issues such as the transition period, the remuneration of the operator&#13;
and of the future SONES, the content of the renewal program to be implemented by the operator,&#13;
the performance standards to be respected by the operator, and SONEES' experience with regard to&#13;
the collection of payment from users, particularly the public agencies. The tenor of this meeting&#13;
was very constructive. It showed that there existed a high degree of interest on the part of the&#13;
prequalified operators and it demonstrated a high level of understanding of the issues on both sides.&#13;
4.38   Minimizing the risks of non-payment by the public sector. Given the importance of water&#13;
consumption by Public Agencies and the poor payment record of the Government (para. 3.8), the&#13;
risk of non-payment or late payment of water bills by public entities is a very serious one for the&#13;
private operator. A high level of risk perceived by the candidates could drive bidding prices up,&#13;
jeopardizing the financial viability of the water sector except with tariff increases which would be&#13;
socially and politically unacceptable for Senegal, or it could even prevent the candidates from&#13;
presenting any bids.&#13;
4.39   The project addresses the issue in a variety of ways: (a) Within the framework of the&#13;
water sector action plan, measures have been adopted (i) to force the Government to schedule&#13;
payment of its water bills and (ii) to limit the water consumption of Public Agencies (para.3. 10);&#13;
(b) The SdE will prepare annual forecasts of water bills for each Government agency no later than&#13;
three months before the end of the preceding year and the Government will budget funds for its&#13;
future bills on the basis of those forecasts. (c) The way in which the monthly payments of the SdE&#13;
to SONES will be calculated also protects, to a certain extent, the operator against late payment or&#13;
non-payment by Government.&#13;
4.40   The exact amnount to be paid to SONES by the SdE during each year of the leasing&#13;
agreement period can only be determined after the end of the year for which those sums are due&#13;
(Annex 4-5). It has therefore been decided that the SdE would pay every month to SONES a&#13;
prespecified amount and that, at the end of the year, any sum which would remain due by one&#13;
entity to the other would be transferred as soon as the data required to calculate the exact value of&#13;
that sum becomes available. The predetermined monthly payments are calculated, not on the basis&#13;
of an estimate of volumes produced or sold, but on the basis of the amount of money actually&#13;
collected by the operator. Non-payment or late-payment by the Government would therefore result&#13;
into lower monthly payments to SONES. The operator's incentives to increase the collection ratio&#13;
remain however intact because, when the exact amount due to SONES for a given year is precisely&#13;
calculated after the end of that year on the basis of the relevant data, it is not the amount of&#13;
collected revenues but the volume of water produced which is then taken into account, as indicated&#13;
in Annex 4-5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
4.41   In addition, a transitory regime will be devised with respect to the SdE's monthly&#13;
paymrents. This regime will take into account the fact that Government Agencies will have four&#13;
months to pay their bills (para. 3.10) and that consequently, during the first few months of its&#13;
activities, the SdE will receive lower revenues. Most of the sums which it will collect during that&#13;
period will have to be transferred back to SONES, as those sums will relate to services rendered&#13;
prior to the establishment of the SdE.&#13;
4.42   The design of the project in three distinct, self-contained, consecutive phases, with each&#13;
phase starting once the previous one is successfully completed, contributes to ensure that the&#13;
government does comply with its obligations, in particular those related to the payment of its water&#13;
bills.  Threats of suspending disbursements can of course be effective only until the last&#13;
disbursement has been carried out. In the long run it is therefore preferable to rely on pressure&#13;
from the consumers themselves to force the Government to comply with its obligations with respect&#13;
to the private operator. The project also promotes that long-term objective by providing for the&#13;
organization of different workshops aimed at increasing understanding and support of the reforms&#13;
on the part of the public (para. 4.27).&#13;
Establishment of ONAS&#13;
4.43   Parallel to the implementation of the institutional reform of the urban water supply sector,&#13;
the Government decided to establish ONAS before the end of 1995 parallel with the establishment&#13;
of the SdE, which would make it possible for SONEES' current sanitation functions to be&#13;
transferred when the SdE is established. (para. 3.29) (Annex 4-1 . ONAS' immediate duties would&#13;
be to ensure the operation and maintain collective sanitation structures, which are now managed by&#13;
SONEES. It was furthermore agreed that the SdE would be given the task of billing, collection and&#13;
transfer of the sanitation payments to ONAS. A follow-up study, financed by the PPF, will identify&#13;
staffing needs as well as the financial equilibrium conditions allowing for the prompt establishrment&#13;
of the public sanitation agency.&#13;
Cost Estimates&#13;
4.44   Project costs (net of direct and indirect taxes and duties) are based on SONEES investment&#13;
plan and on the findings of a feasibility study for the Dakar region financed by France (CFD). A&#13;
summary of cost estimates is presented in table 4.2 (detail cost tables appear in Annex 4-6). Base&#13;
costs are expressed at January 1995 levels, with 10 percent added for physical contingencies.&#13;
Inflation for imported goods and services was estimated in accordance with Bank guidelines (1.5&#13;
percent for 1995, 1.8 for 1996, 2.6 for 1997, and 2.5 for 1998, 1999, and 2000). Local inflation&#13;
was estimated at 2.5 percent per year during the project period. Total project costs amount to&#13;
CFAF 155.2 billion or US$290.1 million in current prices.&#13;
4.45   The Government agreed to defer the collection of taxes and duties during the previous&#13;
project (Cr. 1554-SE) to lessen the impact of these taxes and duties on SONEES during the project&#13;
period. This deferment is still in effect. Prior to negotiations, the Government confirmed that this&#13;
deferment continues to be applied to the newly established public holding company, SONES.&#13;

Financing Plan&#13;
4.46    Project costs would be financed by an IDA credit of US$100 million equivalent, which&#13;
would account for about 34.5 percent of the total project costs. France (CFD) (who jointly&#13;
appraised the project) would finance US$65.7 million. Other financiers include: Germany (KfW)&#13;
(US$25.5 million), Belgium (AGCD) (US$4.1 million), IEB (US$18 million), NDF (US$10.3&#13;
million), BOAD (US$11.9 million), BADEA (US$10.9 million). SONES would provide US$23.1&#13;
million, or 10 percent of potable water investments, which will be generated through sales revenues&#13;
of potable water. Other donors, still to be confirmed, will be providing the remaining US$20.5&#13;
million for Phases II and III of the proposed project. The detailed financing plan is present in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
Annex 4-7. As a condition of credit effectiveness, cofinancing agreements have been executed on&#13;
behalf of Government and cofinanciers, and all conditions of effectiveness and initial disbursement&#13;
of funds thereunder (except the effectiveness of IDA's agreement) have been satisfied (para.&#13;
8.3(h)). Furthermore, credit effectiveness will be subject to the execution of the Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement on behalf of Government and SONES (para. 8.3(a)).&#13;
4.47   The Government would pass US$85.0 million equivalent of IDA's credit to SONES of&#13;
which 45 percent will be onlent to SONES at IBRD terms to signal the cost of capital, and 55&#13;
percent would be provided in the form of equity. SONES would bear the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
During negotiations, Government agreed to the proposed IBRD terms of 20 years, including 5&#13;
years of grace, at an annual interest rate of 7.1 percent (para 8.1 (a)). The loan/equity breakdown&#13;
has been deternined taking into account three constraints: (a) adequately capitalized public&#13;
holding company, (b) financial equilibrium of the potable water sector by the year 2003&#13;
(cumulative cash shortfall equal to zero or positive), and (c) politically and socially sustainable&#13;
tariff increases, required to achieve such financial equilibrium. The need to maintain tariffs within&#13;
an affordable range in the early years of the project (1995-1998) when efficiency gains are not yet&#13;
fully realized, will create a temporary cash shortage, which commercial banks have agreed to&#13;
finance (para. 5.14). The potable water sector would generate all the counterpart funds and carry&#13;
the debt service for water supply investments.&#13;
4.48   US$15.0 million equivalent of the IDA credit would be passed on to the Ministry of&#13;
Hydraulics through a budgetary allocation for the implementation of strengthening the newly&#13;
established public enterprise for urban sanitation (ONAS), for capacity building of SGPRE and the&#13;
Conseil Superieur de l'Eau, and for executing projects and studies for water resources management&#13;
and urban sanitation. The Government would make available to ONAS an amount not exceeding&#13;
US$9.0 million equivalent on a grant basis for the purpose of the implementation of the urban&#13;
sanitization component of the proposed project.&#13;
Advance Contracting&#13;
4.49   Construction work should begin as soon as possible in order to relieve the burden of water&#13;
shortages in the Dakar region. The preparation of final studies and bid documents for the&#13;
production part of the project is ongoing, and is being financed by France (CFD). Advance&#13;
contracting is proposed in order that instructions to begin the work can be given immediately upon&#13;
credit effectiveness. No retroactive financing is considered.&#13;
5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
5.1    SONEES' past financial performance is discussed in Chapter 3. This chapter discusses the&#13;
finances of the sector as well as the six scenarios prepared to estimate tariff increases needed to&#13;
reach financial equilibrium and the rationale for the initial tariff increase. The analysis also&#13;
quantifies the rationale for the institutional reform of the urban water supply sector, without which&#13;
much higher increases would have been necessary to achieve financial equilibrium in 2003 while&#13;
implementing an ambitious investment program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
Future Scenarios&#13;
5.2      The financial equilibrium  of the sector is affected by three main factors: (a) level of water&#13;
tariffs; (b) efficiency of water distribution of the sector linked to a reform of the sector; and (c) the&#13;
proposed project. To evaluate the relative impact of these three factors on the equilibrium of the&#13;
sector, six scenarios were developed. The six scenarios aim to: (a) project into the future the&#13;
current situation assuming no reforms, no tariff increases nor the proposed project investments; (b)&#13;
evaluate the impact of the proposed reforms supported by the proposed project and its investments;&#13;
and (c) estimate alternative water tariff increases, resulting cash flow shortfalls and time framnes&#13;
required for achieving financial equilibrium. The following table summarizes these scenarios.&#13;
Table 5.1. Overview of financial scenarios&#13;

1995 through 2008, the sector is in equilibrium&#13;
in 2008. To maintain year 2003 as the year o&#13;
equilibrium, tariff increases of 5% from 1995&#13;
through 2003 would be required.&#13;

I__________  =__________          _______________   ____________  in     2002.&#13;
Scenario 2 would be acceptable as it would result in a financially viable sector vis-a-vis the State,&#13;
but does not address the serious impact on productivity and poverty alleviation which would be&#13;
exacerbated by the acute shortage of potable water, particularly in the Dakar area. Scenario 4&#13;
demonstrates the positive impact of the tariff increases without the planned reforms. This would&#13;
result in financial equilibrium in the year 2008. Scenario 6 is the base case upon which the&#13;
financial projections were prepared for the proposed operation and is described below. Scenario 6&#13;
shows that financial equilibrium would be attained earlier than Scenarios 4 or 5. The chosen&#13;
scenario assumes that a tariff increase of 3 percent is implemented in July 1, 1995 and annual real&#13;
increases of 2.4 percent are implemented starting in January 1996.&#13;
Financial Equilibrium&#13;
5.3      Restoring financial equilibrium to the water sector is necessary to: (i) alleviate the burden&#13;
of direct and indirect subsidies, or other forns of fiscal support to urban water supply in order to&#13;
liberate finds for other sectors; (ii) bring the level of indebtedness to a level compatible with the&#13;
sector's capacity to service it; (iii) generate enough resources to finance part of the future capital&#13;
expenditures which cannot be financed with loans and also contribute as counterpart funding; and&#13;
(iv) help create the conditions for future private lenders and equity investors to finance an&#13;
increasing part of investments through new financial instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
5.4    The specific target date of 2003 for bringing the sector to financial equilibrium is justified&#13;
for several reasons. First, this is also the current estimated target date for putting in place the&#13;
required financing for the long-term solution to the water problem of the Dakar area, and a sound&#13;
financial footing is necessary before new financial obligations are assumed for the sector. Second,&#13;
Government aims to involve the private sector further through direct financing of future&#13;
investments, in which case, a sound financial footing is also a precondition. And third, a shorter&#13;
time period to achieve financial equilibrium requiring higher tariff increases would be socially&#13;
difficult to implement and inflationary (para. 7.14).  The year 2003 of financial equilibrium&#13;
corresponds to scenario 6 in Table 5.1 which shows equilibrium in year 2002. The year of&#13;
equilibrium of the sector is delayed by one year from 2002 to 2003 as account is taken of the&#13;
additional interest charges on the financing of the temporary cash shortfall of the sector which is&#13;
discussed later in this chapter (para. 5.9).&#13;
Future Tariffs&#13;
5.5    Although both historical and current water vendor rates indicate that consumers are in fact&#13;
willing to pay for services at tariffs that reflect the quality of service, this would need to be&#13;
confirmed by the ongoing willingness to pay study. The method proposed to adjust tariffs would&#13;
reflect changes in urban operating costs and debt service throughout the project period. Except for&#13;
market gardening which is treated separately (paras. 3.19, 3.20 and 3.21) the 2.4 percent real&#13;
increase would be initially applied to all tariff categories. However, beginning in 1998, tariff&#13;
increases would be applied differentially to the various categories on the basis of demand studies to&#13;
be completed during the first two project years. These studies would assess the impact of social&#13;
tariffs which, at minimum, cover operating costs. Currently, there is little information on the price&#13;
elasticity of demand by service categories or cross elasticities for alternative sources of supply to&#13;
justify an approach by categories.&#13;
5.6    For purposes of determining the effect on the tariff, it was assumed that the worst case&#13;
scenario would be where the price of the private operator would be so high so as to eliminate all&#13;
gains achieved through the reform. The results of this analysis indicate that the tariff increase&#13;
would have to double in order to achieve equilibrium in the year 2003 (Scenario 4 in Table 5.1).&#13;
5.7    A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to determine the effect on the tariff and the year&#13;
of equilibrium if the distribution efficiency indicator (as defined in Annex 4-5) is varied. As the&#13;
table below illustrates, if the distribution efficiency target is delayed by 2 years (for instance 85%&#13;
distribution efficiency achieved in 2002 instead of 2000), the year of equilibrium is attained in&#13;
2004 with a 2.4% tariff increase, and the peak cash shortfall rises to -21 billion CFAF in 1998.&#13;
Conversely, if 2003 is maintained as the year of equilibrium, a 3. 1 % tariff increase is required. If&#13;
the distribution efficiency target is delayed even further (85% only achieved in 2005), the year of&#13;
equilibrium is 2006 with a tariff increase of 2.4%. It will require a tariff increase of 3.8% to&#13;
maintain 2003 as the year of equilibrium.&#13;

5.8     During negotiations, Government agreed to take all necessary measures to increase,&#13;
annually, the tariff of water, except for water for market gardening, starting January 1, 1996, so as&#13;
to allow SONES to achieve a targeted financial equilibrium in the water supply sub-sector by&#13;
December 31, 2003. (para. 8.1 (g)). The Govenmment furthermore agreed to, not later than October&#13;
31 of each year, commencing October 31, 1996, review the updated financial projections, and if&#13;
necessary, readjust the annual tariff increase, so as to permit the realization of the targeted&#13;
financial equilibrium referred to. For the purposes of the preceding, the increase of water tariff, in&#13;
1996 and 1997, shall be across the board to all tariff categories (para. 8.1(h)). In addition, the&#13;
Government agreed to, not later than July 1, 1997, prepare and furnish to IDA: (a) a proposal on a&#13;
new tariff structure for water, except for market gardening, to be implemented as of January 1,&#13;
1998; (b) a proposal on a mechanism to apply the annual percentage increase of the water tariff&#13;
differentially to the various tariff categories, excluding market gardening; and (c) subject to&#13;
approval from IDA, implement these proposals (para. 8.1 (i)). As a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness, in a manner satisfactory to IDA, Government would have increased the tariff for&#13;
water by 3 percent in real terms, and applied the increase as of July 1, 1995, except for the market&#13;
gardening sub-sector(para. 8.3 (c)).&#13;
Cash Shortfall/Surplus, Rescheduling and Equity Capital&#13;
5.9     The financial projections as detailed in Annex 5-1 and 5-2 indicate that it will not be until&#13;
the year 2000 that the sector will generate sufficient revenues which would cover operating&#13;
expenses, increases in working capital requirements, debt service payments and a portion of capital&#13;
expenditures. The investments of phase I would, by the year 2000, become operational and&#13;
revenues increase accordingly. Thereafter, between 2000 and 2003, the annual cashflow generated&#13;
by the sector will be positive and the sector's accumulated cash deficit will decline progressively&#13;
when, in 2002, the sector will start generating a net cumulative cash surplus. Further increases in&#13;
tariffs would not be necessary other than to cover inflation (para. 7.3). It is aso expected that the&#13;
operating and working ratios will decrease substantially when the cashflow becomes positive. By&#13;
the end of the project (year 2000), the working ratio will be at an acceptable level (.57). Although&#13;
the operating ratio in the year 2000 is still high (.92), it is expected that by the year of equilibrium&#13;
it will be within an acceptable range (.87). These ratios are included in the Water Sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Monitoring Indicators (Annex 4-41. The assumptions used in the financial projections are detailed&#13;
in Annex 5-2.&#13;
5.10    Before the year 2000, however, the accumulated cash shortfall in the sector is projected to&#13;
increase substantially until the year 1999 due to the low starting point for tariff levels and the&#13;
magnitude of investments to be made between 1996 to 1998. The evolution of the annual and&#13;
cumulative cash shortfall is shown in the following table.&#13;

5.11    Given the current state of public finance, the financing of this shortfall by the Government&#13;
is not possible. Twelve options were examined to raise the necessary amount of temporary&#13;
financing (Annex 5-3 and 5-4). Out of the options analyzed, four measures (commercial bank&#13;
loans, rescheduling of existing sector debt, 55 percent of IDA and 50 percent of KfW financing as&#13;
equity and sale of equipment to SdE) were retained as having a significant impact on the reduction&#13;
in the temporary cash shortfall. The impact of the other three measures are shown in the table&#13;
below. The impact of the financing as equity is already reflected in the financial projections&#13;
(Annex 5-1 and 5-2).&#13;

5.12    The loans by local commercial banks would be made to SONES.  The corresponding&#13;
interest payments on the commercial bank loans being an additional charge to the sector, the&#13;
equilibrium of the sector is reached one year later, i.e., in the year 2003 instead of 2002. An&#13;
interest rate of 10 percent has been assumed for this purpose. The repayment of the loans could be&#13;
supported through an irrevocable instruction by SONES to SdE to transfer a certain percentage of&#13;
the revenues of the sector, after payment of the remuneration of SdE, to an escrow account held&#13;
with an escrow agent. The funds in the escrow account would be secured in favor of the lending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
banks. As a condition of credit effectiveness, SONES would have entered into agreements with&#13;
commercial banks, under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, to provide a line of credit in an&#13;
aggregrate amount equivalent to US$30.5 million, for the purpose of financing the temporary cash&#13;
shortfall of the water supply sub-sector (para. 8.3 (f)). To closely monitor the changes in cash&#13;
shortfall of SONES, a cashflow management system in the form of a monthly cashflow model will&#13;
be developed. During negotiations, Government agreed that SONES not later than June 30, 1996,&#13;
establish a monthly cashflow model for the purpose of managing cash, acceptable to IDA (para.&#13;
8.1 (c)).&#13;
5.13   The rescheduling of the sector's existing debt to the Government is justified on the grounds&#13;
that the amounts which would be rescheduled correspond to portions of existing donors' loans to&#13;
the Government of Senegal which have been canceled. The corresponding portion of the sector&#13;
debt to the Government would be rescheduled, and not canceled, in order to avoid any long-term,&#13;
favorable treatment of the water sector relative to the other sectors of the economy, which would&#13;
not be acceptable as a matter of sound macroeconomic policy.&#13;
5.14   The impact of the on-lending of 55 percent of the IDA credit and 50% of the KfW loan in&#13;
the form of equity capital on the reduction of the temporary cash shortfall is US$12.33 million&#13;
(CFAF 6,597 million). This corresponds to a subscription of equity capital of US$55.6 million&#13;
(CFAF 29,749 million). The impact on the temporary cash shortfall is equal to the amount of&#13;
interest which would have to be paid on the US$55.6 million (CFAF 29,749 million) of the IDA&#13;
credit and KfW loan which would be on-lent to the sector instead of provided in the form of equity.&#13;
There is no impact of the principal repayment on the temporary cash shortfall since there is no&#13;
principal repayment in the period. The sale of equipment and other assets to SdE is also part of the&#13;
measures needed to implement the reform of the water sector and the financing would be provided&#13;
by the private operator.&#13;
5.15   Surcharge. An analysis was also carried out to determine how much of a surcharge each&#13;
year would be required in order to reduce or eliminate the cash shortfall. The following table&#13;
presents the results of this analysis.&#13;

If a surcharge of 10 percent in real terms for 4 years is implemented starting in 1996, the deficit&#13;
could be brought down to levels that are manageable and the year of equilibrium would be attained&#13;
in 1999. Considering however the current level of water tariffs, other measures discussed in the&#13;
preceding paragraphs are proposed (paras. 5.13 and 5.14).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
Financial Projection of SONES/Capital Structure of SdE&#13;
5.16   The following discussion of the capital structure of SONES is based on the financial&#13;
projections developed for the sector (Annex 5-1 and 5-2). The capital structure of SONES and&#13;
that of the water sector are virtually identical since all the capital investments of the sector will be&#13;
carried on the balance sheet of SONES whereas the private operator will carry on its balance sheet&#13;
only the working capital of the sector.&#13;
5.17   As a result of the large investments in the proposed project, the non current portion of the&#13;
long term debt of SONES is projected to increase from US$68.0 million in 1995 (CFAF 36,366&#13;
rnillion) to US$267.7 million in 1999 (CFAF 143,115). In 1999 it would therefore represent 84.5&#13;
percent of long term capital. To mitigate the impact of this large increase, it is proposed that 55&#13;
percent of the IDA credit and 50 percent of the KfW1 loan be passed on to the sector in the form of&#13;
equity capital instead of debt. The long-term debt would then represent 70.6 percent of long-term&#13;
capital, which is still high but is compatible with the debt service payment capacity of the sector as&#13;
evidenced in the financial projections. During negotiations, Government agreed that (i) SONES&#13;
would not incur any long term debt without IDA's concurrence, unless its net revenues for the fiscal&#13;
year immediately preceding the date of such incurrence or for a latter twelve-month period ended&#13;
prior to the date of such incurrence, whichever is the greater, shall be at least, for the year 1996,&#13;
0.8, for the year 1997, 0.9, for the year 1998, 1.3, for the year 1999 and thereafter, 1.4 times its&#13;
estimated maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding fiscal year on all its debt&#13;
including the debt to be incurred (para. 8.1 (e)); and, (ii), SONES would produce, for each of its&#13;
fiscal years, commencing from the fiscal year 1996, funds from internal sources or from any other&#13;
private commercial sources, equivalent to not less than 10 percent of SONES' annual average&#13;
capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, for that year, the previous year and the&#13;
three next following fiscal years (para 8.1 (d)).&#13;
5.18   One of the objectives of the reform is to increase the efficiency of the sector. One indicator&#13;
of this efficiency will be the amount of fixed costs of SONES, and in particular the amount of&#13;
personnel expenses. The basis for 1996 was derived by applying 10 percent of the salary costs of&#13;
SONEES for 1993. During negotiations, Government agreed that SONES would maintain its&#13;
annual expenditures on personnel to an amount, in constant 1995 CFAF, equivalent to not more&#13;
than CFAF 500 million for the year 1996, CFAF 510 million for the year 1997, CFAF 520 million&#13;
for the year 1998, CFAF 530 million for the year 1999, CFAF 540 million for the year 2000,&#13;
CFAF 550 million for the year 2001, CFAF 560 million for the year 2002, and CFAF 570 million&#13;
for the year 2003.(para. 8.1 (f)).&#13;
Capital Structure of SdE&#13;
5.19   The SdE does not carry any fixed assets other than equipment and vehicles on its books.&#13;
Accordingly, it does not require a significant amount of long term capital either in the form of debt&#13;
or equity capital other than to finance the net working capital requirements. On the basis of an&#13;
extrapolation of the working capital requirements of the sector and projections of revenues, it is&#13;
estimated that the net capital requirement of SdE would be approximately US$9.3 million (CFAF&#13;
5,000 million) in the year 1997. Using a long-term debt/long-term capital ratio of 65 percent, this&#13;
would require CFAF 1,650 million (US$3.1 million equivalent) million in the form of equity&#13;
capital or quasi-equity capital, such as subordinated debt. With the proposed long-term capital&#13;
structure, the ratio of coverage of debt by net working capital will be 1.5:1 which is adequate. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
will be the responsibility of the private operator to raise whatever capital is necessary to finance&#13;
operations, either in the form of equity or debt (para. 4.36).&#13;
6. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Implementing Agencies and Responsibilities&#13;
6.1    Within the Direction of Water Works and Sanitation (DHA) of the Ministry of Hydraulics&#13;
a Coordination Unit will monitor progress of the project in coordination with the implementing&#13;
agencies. The manager of this unit will provide periodic reports monitoring the execution of the&#13;
various components of the Project and will particularly focus on the level of fulfillment of the&#13;
Government's commitments. He will be in charge of organizing the dialogue meetings and&#13;
preparing the donors' meeting on the Senegalese side, in particular for the evaluation procedure at&#13;
the end of each phase (para. 6.21).&#13;
6.2    SONES would manage the urban water production and supply components. The private&#13;
enterprise, SdE, would be contracted by the Government to assume technical and commercial&#13;
management of the urban water supply service. In order to implicate the private operator in&#13;
reducing water leakages and to secure continuity in this effort, the SdE would finance and&#13;
implement renewal of the distribution network as part of its management-lease contract. The SdE,&#13;
will also be closely associated for the preparation of tender documents, bid evaluation and&#13;
supervision of works for the rehabilitation of the distribution network (para. 4.35).&#13;
6.3    The Ministry of Hydraulics would manage the implementation of the institution building&#13;
components (strengthening the public holding company (SONES) and the newly established public&#13;
enterprise for urban sanitation (ONAS), and, capacity building of CSE and SGPRE). The&#13;
Ministry of Hydraulics would oversee the implementation of the urban sanitation components by&#13;
ONAS. Credit effectiveness will be subject to the establishment of ONAS and the Government&#13;
having entered into an implementation agreement with ONAS with the purpose of managing the&#13;
urban sanitation component (para. 8.3(d)).&#13;
6.4    During negotiations, the Government agreed to organize, jointly with SONES and ONAS,&#13;
a Project Launch Workshop not later one month after the effectiveness date (para. 8.1 (n)). Credit&#13;
effectiveness will be subject to the adoption by Government of an implementation manual,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA (para. 8.3(i)).&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
6.5    The implementation schedule for the various components of the proposed project is shown&#13;
in Annex 6-1 and 6-2. Implementation would extend over five-years, 1996-2000, divided in three&#13;
distinct phases of 2, 1.5 and 1.5 years, to ensure that new investment follows improvements in&#13;
sector management expected from the new private-public partnership. Each phase is complete in&#13;
itself and consists of a coherent set of components. Subject to completion of the investments and&#13;
compliance with the reform conditions of the previous phase, the following phase will be&#13;
implemented. Phase I will (i) formulate a national water resource management strategy; (ii)&#13;
prepare a strategy for urban sanitation development; (iii) reduce water leakages and increase safe&#13;
drinking water production capacity; and (iv) implement waste water reuse. Phase II will (i)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
increase drinking water storage and optimize operations, (ii) increase access to safe drinking water,&#13;
and (iii) implement rainwater sanitation for the St. Louis area. Phase III will increase access to&#13;
safe drinking water and implement sanitation for Rufisque. Bidding documents for large water&#13;
supply works (increase of production capacity and transmission mains) will be available end of&#13;
June 1995. Advance contracting is proposed in order to begin works immediately upon credit&#13;
effectiveness (para. 4.49). Recommendations of the willingness to pay study (para. 4.31) will be&#13;
the basis for implementing the components low-income house connections and sewer connections&#13;
(paras. 4.17 and 4.19). The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2000.&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
6.6    Key performance indicators would be used to monitor meeting financial and technical&#13;
targets set for the project (paras. 5.18 and 5.19, Annex 6-3 and 8). During negotiations,&#13;
Government agreed to ensure that the Ministry of Hydraulics, SONES and ONAS report quarterly&#13;
to IDA on the progress of each project component and on the evolution of monitoring indicators,&#13;
and that SONES and Government would take all reasonable, remedial action (after discussion with&#13;
IDA) needed for the proper execution of the project, efficient management of the institutions, or the&#13;
meeting of set targets of performance (para. 8.1(k)). These reports would provide timely and&#13;
updated information on project implementation, highlight problem areas, recommend actions to be&#13;
taken and comment on progress in resolving issues and adopting previous recommendations.&#13;
Progress in the implementation of the project will be based on the indicators in Annex 6-4.&#13;
6.7    During negotiations, Government agreed that within six months following the closing date&#13;
of the credit, Mi-, SONES and ONAS will prepare and furnish to IDA a completion report on the&#13;
execution and initial operation of the project components, the cost of, and benefits derived or to be&#13;
derived from, the project, the fulfilment by SONES and the Government of their obligations under&#13;
the Credit Agreement, and the project's success in accomplishing the project objectives (para.&#13;
8.1(1)).&#13;
Procurement&#13;
6.8    Table 6.1 below  summarizes the project elements by disbursement category, their&#13;
estimated costs, and proposed procurement methods. A Country Procurement Assessment Report&#13;
(CPAR) was completed in July 1994. For this project, findings of the CPAR remain valid. In&#13;
general, Senegal's procurement laws and regulations do not conflict with IDA Guidelines. No&#13;
special exemptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in the Credit documents for&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), since Senegal's procurement practices allow IDA&#13;
procedures to take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations. IDA-financed&#13;
goods and works will be procured in accordance with Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). National Competitive Bidding (NBC) advertised&#13;
locally would be carried out in accordance with Senegal's procurement laws and regulations,&#13;
provided that: (i) any bidders are given sufficient time to submit bids (three to four weeks); (ii)&#13;
bid evaluation and bidder qualification are clearly specified in bidding documents; (iii) no&#13;
preference margin is granted to domestic manufacturers; (iv) eligible firms are not precluded from&#13;
participation; (v) award will be made to the lowest evaluated bidder; and (vi) prior to issuing the&#13;
first call for bids, draft standard bidding documents are submitted to IDA and found acceptable.&#13;
Annex 6-5 summarizes the project elements by disbursement category, estimated cost, and&#13;
proposed procurement method. A list of contracts and estimated cost, to be financed out of the&#13;
IDA credit is shown in Annex 6-6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
6.9    Civil works. IDA credit would finance 29.6 percent of the civil works program  (or&#13;
US$68.8 million equivalent, net of duties and direct and indirect taxes). Contracts for treatment&#13;
plants for urban water supply and wastewater purification using performance specifications, and&#13;
contracts for works above US$500,000 equivalent, will be procured through ICB. For contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$500,000 equivalent, national competitive bidding (NCB) may be&#13;
used, provided that the aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed US$4.7 million&#13;
equivalent. Bidders for the treatment plants and civil works projects will be prequalified using IDA&#13;
standard documents and prior review procedures.&#13;
6.10   Goods. The IDA credit would finance 61.4 percent of the project's goods (or US$20.5&#13;
million equivalent, net of duties and direct and indirect taxes). IDA-financed goods will be&#13;
procured through ICB except for goods that cannot be grouped into packages of at least&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent which would be procured through NCB and adequate competition is&#13;
expected, provided that the aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed US$0.3 million&#13;
equivalent. In accordance with the Bank's Guidelines, a preferential margin of 15 percent (or the&#13;
applicable customs duty, whichever is less), over c.i.f. prices of competing goods for all ICB&#13;
procurement would be given to domestically manufactured goods.&#13;
6.11   Consultant and other services. The IDA credit would finance 38.7 percent of services (or&#13;
US$8.7 million equivalent, net of duties and direct and indirect taxes). IDA-financed contracts will&#13;
be contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981).&#13;

Numbers may not add up due to rounding&#13;
6.12   Contract Review.  IDA-financed contracts for works and goods (above US$500,000&#13;
equivalent for works and US$100,000 equivalent for goods) would be subject to IDA's prior&#13;
review procedures. For consultants services, prior IDA review would not apply to contracts with&#13;
firms selected from a short-list estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent and US$50,000&#13;
for individual consultants, but would apply to the terms of reference for such contracts, single-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
source hiring of firms, assignments of a critical nature (as determined by IDA), and amendments to&#13;
contracts that raise their value to more than US$100,000 or US$50,000, respectively. The review&#13;
process would therefore cover approximately 55 percent of the number of contracts and 95 percent&#13;
of the value contracted. On that basis, approximately 34 contracts or eight contracts per year&#13;
(amounting to about US$95 million equivalent) would be subject to prior review which requires a&#13;
reasonable individual workload for the task manager. The number of contracts is limnited to 19 for&#13;
works and 15 for goods. Random checking of smaller contracts subject to post review would be&#13;
carried out in the field during supervision mission and/or by a procurement officer at the Resident&#13;
Mission. Bank's SBDs and Standard Prequalification Documents will be used under ICB. Draft&#13;
standard bidding documents for NCB would be reviewed by and agreed upon with IDA. Contracts&#13;
for goods and services financed under parallel cofinancing arrangements would be awarded in&#13;
accordance with the cofinancier's procurement regulations.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
6.13    The proposed credit of US$100 million would be disbursed against the cost of the project&#13;
as follows:&#13;

Specific disbursement conditions would assure that the project components were fully funded (by&#13;
IDA, Government and, or other cofinanciers) before contracts were awarded. The table below&#13;
gives the estimated schedule of disbursements for the IDA Credit. The closing date of the credit&#13;
would be June 30, 2001. The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit is&#13;
shown in Annex 6-7. It is faster than the profile for Bank/IDA-financed water projects in Africa&#13;
and in Senegal, which reflects the advanced preparation and action taken to expedite procurement&#13;
in anticipation of the IDA credit as well as the implementation arrangements that have been made.&#13;
It is understood that the percentages in Table 6.2 have been calculated on the basis of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
provisions 309 and 1091 of the law 92-40 of July 9, 1992 of the Govermnent of Senegal, which&#13;
exempt the goods and works to be financed from  taxes and customs duties levied by the&#13;
Government of Senegal. If any change is made to this Law which has the effect of levying taxes or&#13;
customs duties on such goods or works, the percentages referred to above shall be decreased in&#13;
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.08 of the General Conditions.&#13;

Special Account&#13;
6.14    To facilitate implementation of the project, Govermnent would establish a special account&#13;
at a commercial bank in Senegal on terns and conditions satisfactory to IDA. Since the contracts&#13;
for civil works and the supply of naterials and equipment will be large, payment for these can be&#13;
made through direct payment, thus reducing overall need for a Special Account for studies,&#13;
capacity building, and training components. Therefore, the authorized allocation to the account&#13;
would be the equivalent in CFAF of US$1,000,000. Upon effectiveness, IDA woiild advance half&#13;
of this authorized allocation and would release the balance when the cumulative disbursement&#13;
under the category of equipment and capacity building studies reaches US$1,500,000. The Special&#13;
Account would be replenished monthly with all replenishment requests being fully documented&#13;
(except for contracts less than US$500,000 equivalent for works, US$100,000 equivalent for&#13;
goods, and other expenditure, which may be claimed on the basis of statements of expenditures or&#13;
SOEs). Documentation supporting Statements of Expenditure would be retained by the Ministry of&#13;
Hydraulics and SONES and be mnade available to IDA supervision missions and external auditors&#13;
for review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
Accounting, Auditing and Insurance&#13;
6.15   During negotiations, Government agreed to ensure that SONES and ONAS prepare their&#13;
financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standards, have their accounts&#13;
audited in accordance with Internationi Auditing Standards by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA, and SONES and ONAS submit their audited accounts to IDA within six months after the&#13;
close of its fiscal year (para. 8.1 (j)). Furthermore, during negotiations, Government agreed that&#13;
SONES furnishes the audit report for 1994 of SONEES to IDA before July 31, 1995 (para.&#13;
8.1(b)). The audit report will include separate opinions on the project's financial statements, the&#13;
statement of expenditures, and the IDA Special Account. Separate statements on the adequacy of&#13;
SONES' accounting system, internal controls, and compliance with financial covenants will be&#13;
provided to IDA. Credit effectiveness will be subject to the appointment of an external auditor on&#13;
the basis of a multi-year contract for the purpose of carrying out auditing of the instituional&#13;
capacity building, urban water supply, and, urban sanitation parts of the project (para. 8.3(g)).&#13;
6.16   During negotiations, Government agreed to ensure that SONES and ONAS furnish for&#13;
IDA's review and comment their annual capital and operating budgets (para. 8.1 (m)).&#13;
6.17   SONES wili carry insurance covering the risks of public utility institution. SONES will&#13;
also cause SdE to insure all fixed assets.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
6.18   Taking into account the complexity of the project, in particular the institution capacity&#13;
building and cofinancing, clos.e supervision will be required (see Annex 6-8). Supervision&#13;
missions should occur at least twice a year, preferably in conjunction with participating&#13;
cofinanciers. In addition to nonnal supervision activities related to the physical implementation of&#13;
the project and to procurement, monitoring indicators and compliance with covenants would be&#13;
followed closely. Corrective measures must be agreed upon and implemented immediately, should&#13;
a new buildup of arrears occur, or in case of non-compliance.&#13;
6.19   During negotiations, Government agreed to organize not later than December 31, 1997,&#13;
June 30, 1999, and, December 31, 2000, a comprehensive project review involving MH, SONES,&#13;
SdE, ONAS and related donors (para. 8.1 (o)). It would review the status of the entire project in&#13;
detail. During these reviews, particular attention would be paid to compliance with covenants,&#13;
progress in implementation and institution capacity building, and the status of the environmental&#13;
mitigation plan. These reviews could lead to corrective measures and possibly to modifications in&#13;
the scope of the proposed project.&#13;
7. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
7.1    Water is a scarce resource in Senegal. An adequate quantity of safe water is basic to&#13;
health, poverty alleviation and productivity. The supply of water to the Dakar region, which&#13;
generates more than 50 percent of Senegal's GNP and its allocation would be made more efficient&#13;
through the proposed project. It would promote conservation and reduce waste. The proposed&#13;
project covers a part of the urban water supply sector investment program from 1996 to 2000. It&#13;
aims at keeping unsatisfied demand in the Dakar region within manageable limits, pending the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
completion of the long-term Dakar water provision project. IDA has endorsed the project's basic&#13;
assumptions about water use and demand forecast as well as the design for the proposed systems.&#13;
All sub-components represent least-cost solutions based on discount rates of 10 and 12 percent.&#13;
Institutional Capacity Building&#13;
7.2    Establishing a public holding company (SONES) and a private operating company (SdE)&#13;
would strengthen the sector's institutional capacity to implement an ambitious investment program,&#13;
establish the financial viability of the sector, and improve the quality of service. Establishing a&#13;
public company (ONAS) to manage the existing infrastructure in urban sanitation and to develop&#13;
the urban and peri-urban sanitation sub-sector, is a measure to reduce the development lag of this&#13;
sector vis-a-vis the water supply sector. The project includes components to strengthen these&#13;
newly established institutions. The project also includes subprojects to provide technical assistance&#13;
to the Ministry of Hydraulics, and strengthen the capacity of CSE and SGPRE in water resource&#13;
management.&#13;
Poverty Alleviation and Health&#13;
7.3    The proposed project is a poverty-focused intervention, geared to improving accessibility&#13;
of safe drinking water to those who do not have it, and sanitation in targeted poor fringe areas of&#13;
Greater Dakar based on conclusions of willingness-to-pay and affordability studies to be carried&#13;
out during project preparation (para. 4.31). It is estimated that the project will provide, for the first&#13;
time, a safe water supply to approximately 460,000 inhabitants.&#13;
7.4    When provided with house connections low-income families consume an average of 6&#13;
cubic meters of water per month. At the social (subsidized) tariff of US$0.28 (CFAF 152.19) per&#13;
cubic meter they would pay US$0.78 (CFAF 419) per month less than people drawing water at&#13;
privatized public standpipes, where 20 liters cost about US$0.01 (CFAF4.5). The social&#13;
consumption limit of 10 cubic meters per month, would cost just 4 percent of the poverty income&#13;
(assumed to be US$200 per capita per year in urban areas) making water highly affordable and&#13;
leaving room for future tariff increases (Annex 4-3). As the flourishing trade of water vendors who&#13;
get triple or higher the official prices - demonstrates, people are willing to pay higher prices for a&#13;
regular, safe and in-yard water supply.&#13;
7.5   In addition, the project's construction activities would create about 15,000 man-years of&#13;
temporary employment.&#13;
7.6    Dakar's overall population would benefit from the project in varying degrees. The urban&#13;
population in the Dakar region (estimated at 1.8 million) would benefit from reduction of the water&#13;
deficit, while more equitable distribution will relieve the hardship on the poor, particularly in&#13;
periurban areas. Although men and women would equally benefit from improved water supply&#13;
service levels, the women in the Dakar region, who traditionally obtain water from distant&#13;
standpipes for their families, would realize substantial savings in time due to improved access. The&#13;
proposed project would lay the ground work for next operation (long-term solution for the Dakar&#13;
water supply), which would bring additional water from the Senegal River and increase Dakar's&#13;
drinking water production capacity, which, in turn, would eliminate the deficit and convey&#13;
sufficient water to the area to satisfy the total demand until the year 2020. The Rufisque&#13;
population (estimated at 150,000) would benefit from the improved sanitary conditions that result&#13;
from the Rufisque sanitation project. In addition, sewerage master plans would be prepared for 19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
urban secondary centers, recently provided with piped water, with the aim of improving sanitation&#13;
services to about 735,000 people (para. 4.18).&#13;
Financial and Economic Justification&#13;
Financial analysis&#13;
7.7    Financially, the proposed water sector project is sound. Tariffs would be set and annually&#13;
adjusted to a level that would, by the end of the year 2003 bring about financial equilibrium in the&#13;
sector. The project would put no additional burden on the national treasury and would enhance&#13;
financial discipline for the sector in general.&#13;
7.8    The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the water supply project is 6.2 percent. The&#13;
modest rate of return is due in part to the fact that tariffs are currently below the full-cost recovery&#13;
level. The analysis assumes that tariffs will be increased gradually over the next eight years so as&#13;
to ensure financial equilibrium for the sector in the year 2003, i.e. cumulative cashflow equal to&#13;
zero or positive (para. 5.4). A sensitivity analysis was conducted assuming increased investment&#13;
costs of the project without further tariff increases. As the table below demonstrates, although the&#13;
FIRR is not at all sensitive, the year when the sector achieves equilibrium is. The peak cash&#13;
shortfall is also notably affected by an increase in costs.&#13;
Table 7.1. Sensitivity analysis of investment costs&#13;

20%                            4.5%                  2006                38.1 in 1998&#13;
Economic analysis&#13;
7.9    The economic internal rate of return EIRR of the water supply project as a whole is 14.1&#13;
percent. The EIRR of the investments in production capacity alone is 17.0 percent. For the purpose&#13;
of the economic evaluation, financial costs were adjusted downward to eliminate income taxes,&#13;
interest, and the depreciation allowance. The exchange rate was assumed to be in equilibrium as a&#13;
result of the 1994 devaluation. Incremental revenues from the sale of water were taken as a proxy&#13;
for direct use benefits. In addition consumer surplus due to the increase in the volume of water&#13;
consumed was estimated based on an assumed price elasticity of -.2. Sensitivity analyses assuming&#13;
increases of 10 percent and 15 percent in operating and/or investment costs resulted in an EIRR of&#13;
11.8 to 13.8 percent for the project as a whole. (Annex 7-1). In addition to the quantified benefits&#13;
included in the economic analysis, there are a number of non-quantified benefits which, if they&#13;
could be included in the analysis, would further increase the EIRR. These include the income effect&#13;
of lower water prices as a result of the installation of 34,000 new low-income house connections&#13;
and 400 public standpipes. Many of the consumers who will benefit from these components&#13;
currently buy water for cooking and drinking from vendors at prices which are estimated to be at&#13;
least three times higher than the unit cost of piped water. Savings in the time and/or investment and&#13;
maintenance costs associated with other alternative sources of water to meet bathing and cleaning&#13;
needs will also contribute to the income effect. Finally, although some of the direct health benefits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
to household members are probably taken into account in the price paid for water services, the&#13;
indirect benefits accruing to other members of the community are not, and thus represent additional&#13;
benefits.&#13;
7.10    At CFAF 550 per cubic meter, the average incremental cost (AIC) of water sold is&#13;
substantially higher than the projected average tariff for 1996 (CFAF 343). However, it is lower&#13;
than the tariff paid by the largest consumers (CFAF 565). Annual real increases of 2.4 percent&#13;
from 1997 -2003 would result in an average tariff which is about 74 percent of the AIC by the year&#13;
2003. By that time, the tariff for the largest consumers could be substantially higher than the AIC,&#13;
depending on how the increases are distributed among the tariff blocks. Initially, the planned tariff&#13;
increases will be applied across the board to all user groups. Demand studies to be conducted&#13;
during the next two years will determine how tariff increases should be distributed among user&#13;
groups in the future to improve financial and economic performance (para. 5.5). In addition to&#13;
raising tariffs, the government is committed to several other actions which will greatly improve the&#13;
financial and economic viability of the sector over the next ten years. These include the reduction&#13;
of unnecessary water consumption and waste in public facilities, the elimination of potable water&#13;
use in the market garden sector, and educational programs to sensitize the public to the economic&#13;
value of water (paras. 3.28 and 4.11) .&#13;
Environmental and Health Impact&#13;
7.11   The proposed Water Sector Project is category B. A detailed environmental analysis&#13;
showed that the project would affect positively the environment, particularly in the area of public&#13;
health. The environmental impact assessment study was carried out in August 1990, updated in&#13;
1995, and has been made available to the public and to all parties concerned. While the proposed&#13;
project would use some of Senegal's groundwater resources, the overall reserves are comparably&#13;
abundant, despite the low recharge rates. The most easily accessible sources near urban areas are&#13;
overexploited, whereas the remote or less accessible aquifers are still underutilized. The long term&#13;
water supply solution for Dakar will likely be based on surface water from Senegal river. The&#13;
most feasible solution is to allow overpumping of accessible groundwater reservoirs, until the&#13;
surface water sources are fully developed. Every effort is, therefore, required to reduce this&#13;
overpumping as soon as possible.&#13;
7.12   The main enviromnental concern is the imnpact of the over-exploitation of the littoral&#13;
aquifers, which could lead to salt water intrusion and deprivation of the traditional shallow wells&#13;
for 12 villages. Key questions include: how much will the saline front move every year, how much&#13;
will the groundwater level drop in the affected areas, and what will the mitigation measures to&#13;
minimize the negative consequences be. These questions have been addressed in the groundwater&#13;
study, which has served as a basis for the environmental impact assessment. The environmental&#13;
mitigation plan (Annex 7-2) includes the preparation by SGPRE of a special groundwater control&#13;
program to monitor saline water movements and the ground water level in the influence areas.&#13;
Moreover, the plan includes the following measures: (a) terminate the overexploitation from the&#13;
Littoral Nord aquifer not later than the year 2005, and, within the framework of the long-term&#13;
water supply solution for Dakar, bring in additional sources of water to recharge the depleted&#13;
aquifers at that time; (b) intensify the groundwater monitoring performance, including groundwater&#13;
flow and water quality; (c) in order to safeguard the underground watertable, cap the production of&#13;
the Littoral Nord and Pout/Sebikotane according to the conclusions of the "Environmental Impact&#13;
Study", and avoid all under-use of the Ngnith treatment station; and (d) anticipate the possibility of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
linking the villagers affected by groundwater depletion to the new piped water supply system&#13;
Credit effectiveness will be subject to the adoption by Government of the environmental mitiation&#13;
plan, satisfactory to IDA (para. 8.3 (i)).&#13;
7.13   The environmental problems that may occur during the construction period can be&#13;
minimized through careful management of men and materials, especially waste materials.&#13;
Recommended measures are included in the environmental mitigation plan (Annex 7-2). The&#13;
increased amounts of sewage in the Dakar sewerage system as result of this project will be treated&#13;
at the existing Camberene treatment plant, which has the necessary spare capacity to meet the extra&#13;
input (para. 4.18). Additionally, decentralized small-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants&#13;
will be built for wastewater reuse for irrigation. In the secondary urban centres it is important to&#13;
coordinate water supply and waste and wastewater disposal measures. The Water Sector Project&#13;
includes sewerage master plans for 19 centers recently supplied with water. It also includes efforts&#13;
to inform inhabitants about problems involved in wastewater disposal and the need to maintain and&#13;
keep clean engineering structures designed for waste, wastewater and drainage purposes.&#13;
Risks&#13;
7.14   There are four primary risks: (a) at the institutional level, it is uncertain that: SONES&#13;
will assume responsibilities from SONEES in an effective and timely manner. To address this risk,&#13;
capacity building for SONES would include: (i) water sector planning and development; (ii)&#13;
project management and implementation; (iii) selection of appropriate water supply and sanitation&#13;
technologies; and (iv) performance monitoring, including maintenance audits; (b) at the financial&#13;
level: whether the objective of sector equilibrium in 2003 will be met within the established&#13;
timeframe given the country's precarious economic and fiscal situation remains questionable. To&#13;
address this risk, (i) a politically and socially sustainable tariff policy would be applied to achieve&#13;
sector financial equilibrium by the year 2003, and key performance indicators would be used&#13;
during project supervison, with clear targets; and (c) at the private sector level: whether there will&#13;
be a sufficient interest, given the complexity of the Dakar situation and the introduction of renewal&#13;
of the distribution network as part of the affermage contract. To address this risk, several upfront&#13;
actions are taken before negotiations, namely: the creation of SONES, the information workshop&#13;
for the prequalified firms. In addition, as a condition of effectiveness, Government would enter&#13;
into an affermage contract satisfactory to IDA, with the private operator; (d) at the private&#13;
operator level: whether the lowest bid will be sufficiently low to allow for financial viability of the&#13;
water sector at a tariff level acceptable to the Senegalese authorities.  This issue has been&#13;
addressed through a series of measures aimed at decreasing the risks incurred by the professional&#13;
operator. Such measures include (i) the capacity building program devised for SONES (see (a)&#13;
above), (ii) the actions adopted in order to ensure sufficient interest from different private&#13;
companies (see (b) above) and (iii) measures, described under paras. 4.37-4.41, aimed at&#13;
minimizing the risks of non-payment or late payment of water bills by Government.&#13;
International Implications&#13;
7.15   The water resources to be used in the Water Sector Project to increase Dakar-area water&#13;
production would be drawn almost exclusively from aquifers within Senegal, with the exception of&#13;
surface water from the Lac de Guiers, which would pass the existing water treatment plant. The&#13;
amount of the water abstracted from the Senegal River for this purpose will be small,&#13;
approximately 0.05 percent of the average river flow at Richard Toll, the junction of the river and&#13;
canal feeding the Lac de Guiers. This amount is well within Senegal's existing rights under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
OMVS agreements. Even though the portion of total water resources needed for municipal water&#13;
supply is comparably small, necessary steps have been taken under the SWSP to prepare a national&#13;
water resource management strategy, to ensure that future water allocations are harmonized with&#13;
other national and international water interests.&#13;
8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
8.1    During negotiations, Government agreed to the following:&#13;
(a)   the proposed onlending IBRD terms (para. 4.47);&#13;
(b)   to ensure that SONES furnishes the audit report for 1994 of SONEES to IDA&#13;
before July 31, 1995 (para. 6.15);&#13;
(c)   to ensure that SONES not later than June 30, 1996, establish a monthly cashflow&#13;
model for the purpose of managing cash, acceptable to IDA (para. 5.12);&#13;
(d)   to confirm that, unless agreed by IDA, SONES would produce, for each of its&#13;
fiscal years, commencing from the fiscal year 1996, funds from internal sources&#13;
or from any other private commercial sources, equivalent to not less than 10&#13;
percent of SONES' annual average capital expenditures incurred, or expected to&#13;
be incurred, for that year, the previous fiscal year, and the three next following&#13;
fiscal years (para. 5.17);&#13;
(e)   to ensure that SONES would not incur any debt, unless the next revenues of&#13;
SONES for the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of such incurrence or&#13;
for a later twelve-month period ended prior to the date of such incurrence,&#13;
whichever is the greater, shall be, for the year 1996, at least 0.8, for the year 1997,&#13;
at least 0.9, for the year 1998, at least 1.3, and for the year 1999 and thereafter, at&#13;
least 1.4 times, the estimated maximum debt service requirements of SONES for&#13;
any succeeding fiscal year on all debt of SONES, including the debt to be incurred&#13;
(para. 5.17);&#13;
(f)   to ensure that SONES would maintain its annual expenditures on personnel to an&#13;
amount in constant 1995, equivalent to not more than CFAF 500 million for the&#13;
year 1996, CFAF 510 million for the year 1997, CFAF 520 million for the year&#13;
1998, CFAF 530 million for the year 1999, CFAF 540 million for the year 2000,&#13;
CFAF 550 million for the year 2001, CFAF 560 million for the year 2002 and&#13;
CFAF 570 million for the year 2003 (para. 5.18);&#13;
(g)   to take all necessary measures to increase, annually, the tariff of water, except for&#13;
water for market gardening, starting January 1, 1996, so as to allow SONES to&#13;
achieve a targeted financial equilibrium in the water supply sub-sector by&#13;
December 31, 2003. (para. 5.8);&#13;
(h)    not later than October 31 of each year, commencing October 31, 1996, review the&#13;
updated financial projections, and if necessary, readjust the annual tariff increase,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
so as to permit the realization of the targeted financial equilibrium referred to in&#13;
para. 8.1 (g) above. For the purposes of the preceding, the increase of water tariff,&#13;
in 1996 and 1997, shall be across the board to all tariff categories (para. 5.8);&#13;
(i)    not later than July 1, 1997, prepare and furnish to IDA: (a) a proposal on a new&#13;
tariff structure for water, except for market gardening, to be implemented as of&#13;
January 1, 1998; (b) a proposal on a mechanism to apply the annual percentage&#13;
increase of the water tariff differentially to the various tariff categories, excluding&#13;
market gardening; and (c) subject to approval from IDA, implement these&#13;
proposals (para. 5.8);&#13;
(j)   to ensure that SONES and ONAS prepare their financial statements in accordance&#13;
with international accounting standards, have their accounts audited in accordance&#13;
with international auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to IDA,&#13;
and SONES and ONAS submit their certified copies of their financial statements&#13;
and audited accounts to IDA within six months after the close of its fiscal year&#13;
(para. 6.15);&#13;
(k)   to ensure that the Ministry of Hydraulics, SONES and ONAS report quarterly to&#13;
IDA on the progress of each project component and on the evolution of specified&#13;
monitoring indicators, and that SONES and Government would take all&#13;
reasonable, remedial action (after discussion with IDA) needed for the proper&#13;
execution of the project, efficient management of the institutions, or the meeting of&#13;

The figure shows the distribution of the total quota of water from the Senegal river allocated to Senegal,&#13;
over the major projects using Senegal river water. On average, there is a significant part (29 percent)&#13;
unallocated. However, this should be interpreted with caution, taking into account that (i) these are&#13;
average figures; (ii) significant seasonal variations in demand and availability may occur; and, (iii)&#13;
environmental "demands" must also be considered.&#13;

SENEGAL&#13;
WATER SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Reform of the sanitation subsector&#13;
Identification of a scenario for the reform&#13;
1.    Background. The increase in water supply capacity as a result of the project, coupled with the fact&#13;
that the institutional and financial framework of the sanitation subsector is far behind that of water supply,&#13;
raises the issue of the future status of the sanitation subsector and makes sanitation issues even more urgent.&#13;
During the preparation of the Water Sector Project, a study of the sanitation subsector was carried out. The&#13;
purpose of this study was to propose institutional arrangements to assure both sustainable development and&#13;
operational profitability. Its findings were submitted to the Senegalese authorities in February 1995.&#13;
2.     Proposed Institutional Arrangement. Given the underdevelopment of sanitation services, it was not&#13;
feasible to include them in the contract for private operation of water supply. The creation of a separate&#13;
institutional arrangement for the sanitation subsector was deemed necessary to give it a higher profile and&#13;
ensure its development. The study recommended that, for the near term, its management and development be&#13;
entrusted to an autonomous operating agency, and that steps be taken to ensure close coordination with the&#13;
water supply sector. The Government has decided to establish an Autonomous National Office of Urban&#13;
Sanitation (ONAS) to be in place before the end of 1995. SONEES will transfer its current sanitation&#13;
functions to ONAS when the water operating company is established. The water company will continue to&#13;
bill consumers and collect sanitation fees, and will transfer them to ONAS. During an initial phase, ONAS&#13;
will limit its efforts to urban and peri-urban areas. It will deal with individual as well as collective&#13;
sanitation, but its immediate duties will be to ensure the operation and upkeep of the collective sanitation&#13;
structures which are now managed by SONEES. Local communities would remain responsible for planning,&#13;
construction and operation of drainage works and systems.&#13;
3.    Implementing the reform. A follow-up study will propose (i) the legal framework and functional&#13;
relationships between ONAS and the various stakeholders; (ii) its organization and staffing; (iii) conditions&#13;
for ensuring financial equilibrium; (iv) options for making greater use of subcontracting; and (v) a high-&#13;
priority action program to rehabilitate the existing networks and increase connections along with potential&#13;
sources of finance.&#13;
Strengthening the new institutional framework&#13;
4.     Remaining challenges. The water sector project includes studies and investments for sewerage in&#13;
19 cities of Senegal at a total cost of more than US$25 million. The success of this component will be&#13;
ensured only if the new institutional framework constructively addresses a number of challenges, and if&#13;
financial and technological issues are dealt with..&#13;
5.    Institutional principles. Responsibilities must be clearly assigned to create an environment which&#13;
creates incentives for efficiency and financial viability. Although ONAS will play a key role in the&#13;
development of urban sanitation, the efforts of a variety of sector stakeholders (Government and&#13;
municipalities, as well as the private sector, NGOs and communities) will remain important and must be&#13;
coordinated in order to avoid an overlapping of authority and functions. Users must be involved in order to&#13;
ensure the long-term viability of the subsector. The public's understanding of sanitation problems must be&#13;
evaluated and the demand for improved sanitation estimated, for example, through studies to measure&#13;
willingness to pay. The capacity of all stakeholders to manage their new responsibilities should be&#13;
reinforced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 2&#13;
6.    Financing principles. Sustainable mechanisms for financing sanitation and achieving cost recovery&#13;
in the sector must be found. The sanitation tax which is added to the water supply bill should be increased&#13;
gradually to reflect more accurately the value of the service received by the user, while remaining&#13;
affordable. Programs to promote sanitation need to be accompanied by appropriate financing mechanisms.&#13;
Sources of finance for on-site sanitation and new connections to existing networks need to be identified.&#13;
7.     Technological principles.   Senegal has a relatively well developed collective sanitation&#13;
infrastructure, compared to other countries of the subregion. Nevertheless, sewerage networks are under-&#13;
utilized and sophisticated treatment plants impose a burden in terms of maintenance and operating costs.&#13;
Improving urban sanitation services must be consistent with the socio-economic characteristics of the&#13;
population, the physical constraints of the environment and the circumstances of urban development.&#13;
Technologies should be consistent with user preferences and needs, and acceptable from the environmental&#13;
standpoint. In support of low-cost, on-site solutions, a strategy for the treatment of fecal matter from septic&#13;
tanks and latrines, and for final disposal of wastes needs to be elaborated.&#13;
Formulation of a national urban sanitation strategy&#13;
8.    The strategy will be formulated after ONAS is established, but prior to the implementation of the&#13;
sanitation engineering studies and investments, planned in Phase II and III of the Project. All sector&#13;
stakeholders will be involved. In addition to the specific issues of the subsector, the strategy will address&#13;
cross-sectoral issues and the environmental awareness of the population. ONAS will play a leading role in&#13;
the steering committee, which will be chaired by the MI. This committee will include representatives of&#13;
various ministries dealing with sanitation, and SONES. A launching workshop will be organized early 1996&#13;
with support of IDA and GREA, to discuss priorities of the national urban sanitation strategy and to define&#13;
terms of reference.&#13;

SENEGAL&#13;
WATER SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
La consommation d'eau potable dans les quartiers&#13;
urbains defavorises&#13;
1.     La forte densite de l'habitat a Dakar et Pikine a permis que la couverture en reseau&#13;
d'adduction d'eau soit relativement elevee. II reste encore pres de 5000 puits dans le Grand Dakar,&#13;
mais, avec l'extension de la couverture en eau par la SONEES, la plupart sont abandonnes. Seuls&#13;
certains quartiers de Keur Massar, et les extensions de Thiaroye Kao et des zones ponctuelles a&#13;
Guinaw Rail et Darou Salam ont une couverture en eau de la SONEES inferieure a 50%. La&#13;
situation est plus mitigee dans les autres villes. Diourbel, certains quartiers centraux de Kaolack et&#13;
de Ziguinchor presentent des conditions assez similaires a Dakar. Les autres quartiers, recemment&#13;
occupes, peu peuples, avec des constructions en paille, banco ont une couverture en eau tres faiblc.&#13;
2.     Deux causes expliquent le faible taux de couverture en eau de la SONEES: dans les&#13;
quartiers urbanises, la population revendique la couverture en eau de la SONEES a 100%, et la&#13;
volonte de payer l'eau au prix SONEES est independante de la capacite financiere des m6nages.&#13;
Meme les menages les plus pauvres depenseront, si necessaire, bien plus de 10% de leurs revenus&#13;
monetaires pour s'assurer une eau disponible et saine. A Dakar et a Pikine, les zones&#13;
insuffisanmment couvertes en eau sont des zones d'habitat recent. Ces zones sont encore peu peupl6s&#13;
pour justifier une extension importante du reseau. La population demande un approvisionnement&#13;
r6gulier en eau, mais concoit que des bomes fontaines soient bien suffisantes en l'absence d'une&#13;
densification de l'habitat.&#13;
3.     La region de Dakar souffre d'un deficit permanent de la production d'eau, dui a une&#13;
croissance rapide de la demande. En effet, en 1994 la demande moyenne etait de 230,000 m3/j&#13;
pour un volume disponible d'environ 128,000 m3/j. Les autres difficultes qui contribuent a la&#13;
degradation de l'alimentation en eau de la region de Dakar sont essentiellement liees a la vetuste et&#13;
a l'heterogeneite du reseau, notamment a Dakar Centre, Pikine, Sicap, Grand -Yoff, Rufisque - aux&#13;
fuites dans les reseaux (env. 60.000 m3/j), aux extensions successives du reseau initial pour suivre&#13;
I'evolution de l'habitat, au deblocage de l'attribution des quotas maraichers, ce qui entra7ne un&#13;
depassement des volumes alloues au maraichages (9,4% au lieu de 7% autorises). Ces facteurs&#13;
affectent la qualite du service et se traduisent par des manques d'eau et des baisses de pression dans&#13;
plusieurs quartiers de Dakar et de la banlieue. Face a cette situation de deficit, une serie de&#13;
solutions a e  etudiee. Parmi celles retenues et mises en oeuvre on peut mentionner une tarification&#13;
dissuasive pour eviter les gaspillages, la suspension de l'attribution de quotas mara^ichers, la&#13;
diminution des pertes, la privatisation des bornes-fontaines, le renouvellement du reseau de Dakar&#13;
et la realisation de travaux urgents.&#13;
4.     Malgre ces mesures, la production d'eau n'est pas suffisante pour satisfaire les besoins. A&#13;
Dakar, la SONEES est obligee de proceder regulierement a des r66quilibrages de son reseau pour&#13;
alimenter les quartiers periurbains. Toutefois une extension projetee dans les quartiers defavorises&#13;
reste possible du fait de la proximite de ces quartiers par rapport aux conduites maitresses&#13;
d'adduction et des faibles consommations d'eau des populations pauvres. Les zones periurbaines&#13;
des autres grandes villes ne connaissent pas, pour le moment de problemes relatifs a la quantite&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62                                   Annex 4-2&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
d'eau produite. Les extensions realisees ne posent aucun probleme au niveau de la quantite d'eau et&#13;
il n'y a pas de problemes de pression de service.&#13;
5.     L'une des plus grandes contraintes pour l'acces des pauvres a l'eau potable, est le coat&#13;
eleve du branchement qui est incompatible avec les revenus modestes des populations defavoris6es.&#13;
C'est pourquoi, il est necessaire d'inclure dans les nouveaux programmes d'hydraulique urbaine&#13;
des operations de branchements sociaux subventionnes avec une faible participation des&#13;
populations beneficiaires. II ne s'agit bien entendu que du coat d'etablissement du branchement, les&#13;
factures d'eau etant entierement a la charge des abonnes.&#13;
6.     En plus de la lutte contre la pauvrete, ces operations de branchements sociaux permettent&#13;
(i) de reduire sensiblement les depenses d'eau des populations demunies qui, a travers les circuits&#13;
de revente d'eau, paient le metre cube a un prix nettement plus eleve que les usagers raccordes&#13;
(realite tres paradoxale constatee a chaque fois que le nombre de branchements est insuffisant); (ii)&#13;
d'arn6liorer sensiblement les conditions de sante et d'hygiene des populations pauvres; et, (iii)&#13;
d'accroitre le chiffre d'affaire de la societe de distribution d'eau (plus d'eau vendue) et&#13;
corr6lativement permettre un retour rapide de la subvention initialement consentie.&#13;
7.     Pour les branchements domestiques dans les quartiers p6ri-urbains, la consommation peut&#13;
etre estimee a 38 litres par habitant et par jour en hivernage, et a 25 litres en saison seche. Ces&#13;
chiffres sont faibles, parce que de nombreuses coupures d'eau intervenaient r6gulierement. Ils&#13;
doivent etre revus a la hausse, du fait d'une amelioration dans la distribution de nombreux&#13;
quartiers. Une consommation moyenne de 50 litres par personne et par jour est consideree comme&#13;
"normale" quand l'offre peut satisfaire la demande.&#13;
8.     Pour les bornes fontaines, la consommation peut etre estimee a 29 litres par habitant et par&#13;
jour en hivernage, et 19 litres en saison seche, chiffres qui restent sans doute similaires&#13;
actuellement. On retiendra la norme de 25 litres en moyenne par personne et par jour dans des&#13;
villes obi n'existent pratiquement pas des sources d'eau alternatives (Dakar). Une borne-fontaine&#13;
peut a elle seule assurer l'approvisionnement de 200 a 300 habitants environ.&#13;
9.     Pour amidjorer l'acces a l'eau potable aux populations pauvres, le projet prevoit la&#13;
realisation d'un programme de 34,000 branchements sociaux et 400 bornes-fontaines dans les&#13;
quartiers peri-urbaines. Sur la base d'un moyenne de 10 habitants par branchement et 300&#13;
habitants par bornes-fontaines et tenant compte des consommations specifiques definies ci-dessus,&#13;
environ 460,000 pauvres devraient ben6ficier de ce programme pour une consommation totale de&#13;
pres de 20,000 m3/j. Ainsi donc, grace au projet, l'acces permanent a l'eau potable sera garantie&#13;
pour 31% de la population de la ville de Dakar ob le taux de pauvrete moyen est estim6 a 16%&#13;
(voir Rapport No 12517-SE, Senegal, An assessment of living conditions (1995)) . Le debit&#13;
residuel de l'augmentation de production et de reduction des pertes, realise par le projet, c'est-a-&#13;
dire environ 60,000 m3/j, permettra d'att&amp;nuer les deficits d'alimentation en eau des autres&#13;
quartiers et ameliorera sensiblement la qualite de l'eau par la reduction des interruptions dans le&#13;
reseau de distribution.&#13;

The legal relations between the State (supervisory authority) and SONES will derive from the contract granting the concession to manage&#13;
the urban water supply facilities and public works to be concluded between them. Under this contract, SONES will have the exclusive&#13;
right to acquire and construct works and facilities for production, transport, storage and distribution of drinking water in Senegal. In&#13;
return, the State in its capacity as party granting the concession will have a right of superviaion over SONES. This supervision, which&#13;
constitutes a real obligation for the party granting the concession, will be exercised under the conditions specified by the concession&#13;
contract and by pertinent specifications. The functional relations between the State and SONES will be determined by a contrat plan that&#13;
will precisely define the parties' commitments. The legal relations between the State (supervisory authority) and the operating company&#13;
(SdE) will be governed by the affermase contract and the pertinent specifications and annexes. SONES will cosign the affermage contract.&#13;
This contract will entrust drinking water production and distribution to the SdE on an exclusive basis in the specifically designated urban&#13;
sectors for a period of ten years with possibility of renewal. The SdE will also be required to renew the distribution network with a&#13;
contractually specified length per year. On behalf of the State, the leasing authority (SONES) will oversee the SdE, its lessee. This&#13;
oversight will be performed by SONES on the basis of performance criteria defined in the performance contract that will be concluded&#13;
between SONES and the SdE. The lessee will be required to communicate various plans and financial reports and activity reports&#13;

Definitions&#13;
Infrastructure: Water supply infrastructure consists of all fixed assets and those moveable assets that are fixed by destination. The water&#13;
supply infrastructure is owned by the SONES.&#13;
Operating equipnment: Operating equipment consists of all moveable assets that are necessary for efficient and effective operation of the&#13;
system including domestic water meters. The operating equipment is owned by the SdE.&#13;
Maintenance of water supplv infrastructure: Maintenance includes all supplies and works that are valuable or necessary for a reliable&#13;
functioning of the water supply system. Reliable functioning is hereby defined as that all parts of the system, from water extaction&#13;
drinking water production and transportation, and water distribution including domestic water meters, contribute, without interuption, to&#13;
the supply of sufficient water at a suitable pressure and of good quality, that complies with the national prevailing drinking water standards&#13;
and guidelines. Maintenance should be performed in such a way, that any part of the water supply system will properly function at least&#13;
during a period that is equal to the predefned depreciation period. All repairs of damages caused by whatever reason are to be considered&#13;
as maintenance.&#13;
Renewal of water supply infrastructure: Investments for renewal include any studies, engineering designs, civil works, equipment and&#13;
supplies, that are required to replace or renovate any part of the water supply infirastructure, afler, as a minimum, the depreciation period of&#13;
that part has passed, and provided that considerable technical arguments justify renewal. Renewal of any part of the water supply&#13;
infrastructure for technical reasons is considered necessary only if the gained improvement can be demonstrated in technical as in financial&#13;
terms. Therefore any decision for renewal of any part of the water supply infrastructure should be supported by a documented proposal by&#13;
the SdE.&#13;
Extension of water supply infrastructure: Extension of water supply infrastructure include any studies, engineering designs, civil works,&#13;
equipment and supplies, that are required (i) to extend the capacity of drinking water production, of water transportation or storage, and of&#13;
water distribution (including house connections); or, (ii) to upgrade the technical condition of the existing facilities through increased&#13;
performance, better quality of the product; or increased operations reliability.&#13;

INSTITUTIONAL REFORM OF THE URBAN WATER SUBSECTOR:&#13;
REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS, INCENTIVES TO REDUCE WATER LOSSES,&#13;
TARIFF INCREASES AND INDEXATION OF TARIFFS&#13;
I.     REMUNERATION FORMULAS AND INCENTIVES TO REDUCE WATER LOSSES&#13;
A.     Basic Principles&#13;
1.     Amounts payable by subscribers for potable water supply are billed and collected by the&#13;
operating company (Societe d'Exploitation, SdE) for its own account.&#13;
2.     The SdE will pay the public holding company, SONES, a fee based on the amount of water&#13;
produced, adjusted to reflect targets for reducing water losses and for collecting water bills.&#13;
3.     The operator's remuneration covers:&#13;
-     operating and maintenance expenses for production and distribution facilites, including&#13;
all operator charges stipulated in the leasing agreement;&#13;
-    general expenditure and profits of operation;&#13;
-    the cost of renewing the distribution system, as specified in the leasing and the&#13;
performance agreements; and&#13;
-    the cost of assisting SONES to procure and supervise rehabilitation works for the&#13;
distribution system, as stipulated in the leasing agreement (contrat d'affermage).&#13;
4.     SONES's income covers:&#13;
debt service for investments and rehabilitation,&#13;
*      a contribution to the cost of new investments,&#13;
*     SONES's administrative costs.&#13;
5.     The financial arrangements reflect the fact that the costs of the public holding company (i.e.,&#13;
investment costs) are related to the capacity of the system, not to the operations. They also provide an&#13;
incentive for the operator to limit wastage and water losses and to optimize the collection rate for water&#13;
bills. The remuneration formula which has been adopted links the remuneration of the public holding&#13;
company to the volume of water produced (adjusted to reflect the targets for water loss reductions and&#13;
collection of bills) rather than to the volume of water sold. The operator is rewarded for improving&#13;
performance as regards these targets, and is penalized for failing to reach thern.&#13;
B.     Definition ofAverage Tariff&#13;
6.     The average tariff per m3 billed (net of taxes) each year is defined as the weighted average of all&#13;
tariffs, including the market gardening tariff, and tariff brackets applied:&#13;
Tm= {(E Ti * Vi) + ( Tj * Vj)} / Vf                                   (1)&#13;
where:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66                                     Annex 4-5&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
Tm:       average tariff billed, per m3 (CFAF/m3), including market gardening.&#13;
Ti:      tariff for tariff bracket i, per m3 (CFAF/m3) of the tariff schedule, excluding market&#13;
gardening during the year.&#13;
Tj:      tariff for tariff bracket j, per m3 (CFAF/m3) of the market gardening tariff schedule during&#13;
the year.&#13;
Vi:       volume of water billed during the year (m3/year) for tariff bracket i of the tariff schedule,&#13;
excluding market gardening.&#13;
Vj:       volume of water billed during the year (m3/year) for tariff bracket j of the market gardening&#13;
tariff schedule.&#13;
V,:      total volume of water billed during the year (m3/year):&#13;
Vf= Z V1+ Z Vj                              (m3/year)          (2)&#13;
C.     Productvity Ratios&#13;
7.     The ratio of volume of water billed annually to volume of water produced annually, the system's&#13;
technical output, is defined as ilf:&#13;
if = Vf Np                                                     (3)&#13;
where Vp is the volume of water produced (m3/year).&#13;
The indicator of water losses is thus:&#13;
1- Tif = 1- V,'Vp                           ()(4)&#13;
The commercial collection rate during the year in question, the percentage of total billings which is&#13;
actually collected by May 15 following the year in which the water billed was consumed is defined as il,&#13;
The volume of water billed for which payment was collected by May 15 following the year in which the&#13;
water was consumed is thus:&#13;
Vp 'If nc                                   (m3/year)          (5)&#13;
and the actual amount collected by the operator, ME, is:&#13;
ME=TMVP Nf Tc                               (CFAF/year)        (6)&#13;
D.     Remuneration formulas&#13;
8.     The operator is expected to reduce water losses to 0.15 Vp , corresponding to a technical output&#13;
of 0.85, by year 5 of the afferrnage contract. The target value for the water losses ratio in each year n is&#13;
defined as 1 - ilV, ,where ,the target technical output ratio, T1 f ,is defined as follows:&#13;
l's= (ff,0 + 0.01) for n = 1&#13;
TVt = ('r(fO + 0.04) for n = 2;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Anne"4&#13;

rj', = (yf,O + 0.07) for n = 3;&#13;
= (-nf + 0.010) for n = 4;&#13;
rl'fi,= 0.85 for n = 5 and each year thereafter,&#13;
where n = 0 in 1995; n = 1 in 1996; n = 2 in 1997, etc.and&#13;
where 11io is defined as the actual technical output ratio achieved by SONEES in 1995. The water losses&#13;
ratio SONEES expects to achieve in 1994 is 0.27. Thus, 'to = 0,73. This value is to be confined on the&#13;
basis of SONEES' 1994 annual report. It will be assumed that the 1995 value is equal to the achieved&#13;
value in 1994. If the real tl,;is significantly different from 0.73, the requirement to achieve 0.85 by year&#13;
5 may be reviewed.&#13;
The operator will maintain up-to-date statistics on the number of water leaks, for use as an indicator in&#13;
monitoring progress.&#13;
9.     The target values for the collection rate, tVJ, for each year n in which the affermage is effective&#13;
are established as follows:&#13;
11C,, = ilc,o + O   for n = 1;&#13;
r'l' C lc,o+0.01 forn=2;&#13;
1n = tlc,o + 0.02 for n = 3&#13;
'   = 0.,97 for n = 4 and each year thereafter,&#13;
where n = 0 in 1995; n = 1 in 1996; etc., and&#13;
where Tib. is defined as the rate of cost recovery, achieved by SONEES in 1995. The collection rate&#13;
SONEES expects to achieve in 1995 is 0.95 (n,0=0.95) This value is to be confinned on the basis of&#13;
SONEES' 1994 annual report. It will be assumed that the 1995 value is equal to the achieved value in&#13;
1994. If the real no is significantly different from 0.95, the requirement to achieve 0.97 by year 3 can be&#13;
reviewed.&#13;
10.    The amount (Rp) to be paid to the public holding company SONES by the SdE during each year&#13;
n of the leasing agreement period is calculated as follows:&#13;
Rp = (T. - Pc) Vp tl'f 1%1Vc               (CFAF)            (7)&#13;
where Pe is the operator's bid price, as adjusted annually for inflation.&#13;
11.    The amount collected is to be divided into two parts:&#13;
ME = Rp + Re                               (CFAF)             (8)&#13;
where:&#13;
Rp:   remuneration of the public holding company SONES (CFAF/year)&#13;
R,:   remuneration of the operating company SdE (CFAF/year)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4-5&#13;
68                                 Page 4 of 6&#13;
It follows from (8) that&#13;
Re = ME - Rp                               (CFAF)            (9)&#13;
Substituting for ME from formula (6), and for Rp from formula (7), the remuneration realized by the&#13;
operator is thus:&#13;
R. = Tm VpnfqC - [(Tm - Pe) (Vp ¶1'fn ',n)]  (CFAF)         (10)&#13;
Factoring and regrouping results in:&#13;
Re = P. (Vpn 'fs'  ) + Tm[(Vp tf TI) - Vp  'f. T')]  (CFAF)  (11)&#13;
Thus the operator's remuneration consists of two parts. First, the bid price, P., is applied to the target&#13;
volume to be sold and collected for, (Vp rl'f, T'.,n ). Then the full value of the average tariff, Tm is applied&#13;
to the difference between the operator's actual volume sold and collected for, (Vpnf Ir.) and the target&#13;
volume. As a result, the operator realizes the full value of the gain or loss resulting from any&#13;
improvement over, or failure to attain, the targets.&#13;
E.    Monthly Payments to SONES and Annual Payment Adjustment&#13;
12.    To expedite the process of monthly payments from the operator to SONES, monthly payments&#13;
will be made on the basis of the actual amount collected from users during the month following&#13;
anrangements specified in the bidding documents. The operator will transfer to SONES an amount, RP m&#13;
,defined as:&#13;
Rpum = ME. - P. (Vpm nf,n 1cx )-           (CFAF)           (12)&#13;
where&#13;
Rp,:  monthly payment to SONES&#13;
MEEm: actual amount collected from users during the preceding calendar month&#13;
Vp,:  the volume of water produced during the preceding calendar month&#13;
At the end of each year, the annual revenue of SONES, Rp will be calculated on the basis of formula (7),&#13;
and the operator will transfer any amount due to SONES for that year, by a specified date of the&#13;
following year. Any amount due the operator will be subtracted from payments due to SONES on&#13;
account of the current month, and if necessary, subsequent months&#13;
F.     Discussion&#13;
13.    The operator's motivation to reduce losses stems from the fact that the rate of losses and the rate&#13;
of recovery used to determine arnounts owing to SONES rise from year to year. This means that in&#13;
order to continue receiving the same proportion of total revenues, the operator must gradually reduce&#13;
losses and increase the recovery rate. It also implies that if the operator succeeds into reducing losses or&#13;
increasing the recovery rate more rapidly than envisaged in the formula, the operator may keep any&#13;
additional revenues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
69                                  Annex 4-5&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
14.   In view of the above, only the operator has a direct financial interest in reducing losses. The&#13;
amounts received by SONES depend on the volume of water produced. SONES would not benefit&#13;
directly from a more rapid reduction of losses than called for in the leasing agreement. In fact, it could&#13;
be maintained, given the formula, that from a purely financial standpoint SONES has an interest in&#13;
seeing the losses increase. In order to maintain the volume of water reaching the consumer, it will be&#13;
necessary to increase the volume of water produced, augmenting the amounts owing to SONES. The&#13;
risk that SONES will actively seek to prevent losses from being reduced is negligible, however, since the&#13;
current water deficit is of such a magnitude that in the coming years the volume of water produced will&#13;
assuredly remain close to the maximum, regardless of the amount of losses.&#13;
15.    Nevertheless, it is essential that the party having a direct interest in reducing losses (i.e. the&#13;
operator, not SONES) be the one responsible for designing and executing works to reduce unaccounted-&#13;
for water, i.e. works relating to system maintenance, repair, renewal and rehabilitation of the system.&#13;
The documents included in the bidding documents are meant to ensure that this principle be adhered to as&#13;
much as possible. The leasing agreement specifies, therefore, that maintenance and repair are the&#13;
responsibility of the operator, as are renewal of operating equipment, distribution lines and service&#13;
connections.&#13;
16.    The performance agreement assigns responsibility to the operator for rehabilitation of the&#13;
system and service connections. SONES must approve the renewal program and rehabilitation program&#13;
of the distribution system, submitted by the operator; however, in the event of an impasse, the procedure&#13;
detailed in the leasing agreement for the settlement of disputes may be applied.&#13;
II.    FORMULA FOR INDEXING OPERATOR'S PRICE Pe&#13;
17.    To reflect changes in economic conditions, the operator's price P. is indexed. Price Pe will be&#13;
adjusted at the beginning of each calendar year, beginning on the effective date of the leasing agreement,&#13;
by application of an indexing coefficient defined in the bidding documents.&#13;
18.    The operator may request SONES to review the indexing formula at the end of the first five-&#13;
year period of execution of the leasing agreement. Such a request is to be submitted to SONES at least&#13;
six months in advance, and must be justified by a discrepancy between the existing formula and actual&#13;
trends in prices.&#13;
m.    INDEXING FORMULA FOR AVERAGE INVESTMENT PRICE Pp&#13;
19.    To reflect changes in economic conditions, the average investment price Pp is indexed. Price Pp&#13;
will be adjusted at the beginning of each calendar year beginning on the effective date of the affermage&#13;
agreement, by application of an indexing coefficient defined in the bidding documents.&#13;
IV.    ANNUAL INCREASE IN WATER TARIFF IN REAL TERMS&#13;
20.    To achieve the targeted financial equilibrium in the potable water sector, an annual increase by&#13;
the year 2003 of r percent, adjusted annually, is applied to the tariff schedule, excluding market&#13;
gardening. At the same time, given the action plan to reduce the use of potable water for market&#13;
gardening, the trend in the average market gardening tariff in real terms is projected as follows: during&#13;
the period 1995-1997: CFAF 100; during the period 1998-2005 (implementation of the long-term&#13;
solution in ie. sustainable water supply from the Senegal river to the Dakar Region): CFAF 160. (cf&#13;
Annex 8)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70                                  Annex 4-5&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
The different average tariffs are linked by the following formulas:&#13;
The average tariff excluding market gardening, T,,:, and the average market gardening tariff, T., are&#13;
defined as follows:&#13;
T= (z Ti *Vi) / E Vi                                (13)&#13;
T.t =t( T1 *V) / E V,                               (14)&#13;
When formulas (16) and (17) are introduced into formula (1), the following formnula is obtained:&#13;
T. * Vf = (T. * E V  + (T. * E vj)                 (15)&#13;
The projected average water tariff for year n to achieve the targeted equilibrium is calculated by the&#13;
following formula:&#13;
T.w Vgf, = T,,, C VW + T,n (E Vy,                   (16)&#13;
with                            Tmc,nTmco * (1+r/1O0)n+l                            (17)&#13;
taking into account the application of the r percent increase. The annual increase of r percent will be&#13;
adjusted annually.&#13;
T,.,n = 100 or 160 F.CFA                           (18)&#13;

V.   AGREEMENT ON BASE YEAR INDICATORS AND MEiTHODOLOGIES&#13;
22.    Prior to the effe tiveness of the affernage contract, the professional partner selected for the SdE&#13;
and SONES will discuss the calculation of the base year (1994 or 1995 as appropriate) indicators. The&#13;
results of this discussion will be recorded in a convention.&#13;

CHOICE OF SCENARIO&#13;
he folowi g scenanos were nm during project preparaion. Scenario 6 is the Base case for the financial prjections.:&#13;
Scenario No. 1: no PAD, no instiutional reform, no  ff inreas&#13;
Scenario No. 2: scenario No. 1 but an equibium prie is set&#13;
Scenario No. 3: PAD, but no institutonal reform or tariff increase&#13;

on to lines: one line without impact of the reform and one line with the impact When the chosen scenano is No S or 6, the&#13;
model aomcaDly records the data appearing on the with impact line. Otherwise the modd autmaally records the data&#13;
appeaing on the witxxt impact" lines.&#13;
SECONDARY ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
IMPACTS OF INSTrT=lONAL REFORM&#13;
P~o n  anddislibution efficency ratos&#13;
Producfion  fic:&#13;
A production efficieny ratio is defined for the PAD and another for the SW/oP. It is noted that the institu l refrm&#13;
has no impact on production efficiency.&#13;
-      PAD production efficiency ratio (source, consultant (BRL) report of November 1994) is 980% at project stat-&#13;
up;&#13;
-      the production efficiency ratio of the present SONEES is 95% for the entire life of the mode.&#13;
Dilqnbuton diinv&#13;
With respect to diribuon, it is assumed that the water deriving from the PAD has the same prodcion efficiec as&#13;
the netwvk as a whole. On the other hand, the reform has an impact on distnbution eficency;&#13;
The distibuion effic y ratio without impact of the reform is a uniform 730/, whih corresponds to the 1994 raio,&#13;
according to information obtainod from SONEES;&#13;
The efficiny ratio with impact of the reform develops as follows:&#13;

firom 1998 are assumed to be 3%.&#13;
Without the reform, ocstomer credit, expressed in unover month  is 6 months for Govmnt osomers and 4&#13;
months for other acuomem&#13;
With impact of the retrm, the rates evolv duing the fis years of the reform  Tbe Steering Committee has adapted&#13;
the following credits: (i) Govrment acsmers: in 1994: 6 months; in 1995: 5 months; and 1996 onwauds: 4 months For&#13;
privak cusomers: in 1994 and 1995: 4 months and from 1996 onwards: 3 months&#13;
Simplier credit&#13;
Without the impact of the reormn, four months of tunover are asumed. With the reorm, SdE is asked to improe this&#13;

VOLUMES OF WATER SOLD&#13;
The volums sold by the PAD and SW/oP are calblated by multiplying the volumes produed in each modul by the&#13;
gbal rates (production and distruion) in each modble.&#13;
TURNOVER&#13;
A separat unover has been caated for the 'market gardenig tariff category, the public administration category,&#13;
and an overall tunvr for all other catgories The tr   for the water sector is the sum of the these three catgorie&#13;
The average tariff is basod on the SONEES' description of amounts and volumes of sales by production regim fh the&#13;
year 1994.&#13;
The totals in volume and in CFAF were adjusted for the following fctors:&#13;
-      convmon of total billing inclusrve of all taxes into total billing net of tax (VAT is 10%);&#13;

Following thee adjusents, the average tariff was obtained by dividing amnt billed by volume biled, yilding an&#13;

It is assumed that the average tariff will be increased by 1.5% as of July 1, 1995 and 2.4%/. fomm 1996 thmugh 2003&#13;

The volume sold to ma  gardeners reflects losses due to the estimated producion effiency raio for the volume of&#13;
water produced by the PAD. The volume remaining available before distibution dficiency impact for otba tariff caegories is&#13;
thus equal to:&#13;

(m3 per day)&#13;
The volume sold to the public administation category in 1998 is reduced by 10,000 cubic meters per day which is due to the&#13;
campaign to reduce laks and losses in public builings&#13;
If after 2004 (date of enty into effect of the long terme CANAL DU CAYOR), M a  Gader        are stil&#13;
using potable water to irrigate tbeir cmps they will pay fDr the water at a tariffequal to the opporumty cost ofpoable water.&#13;
FINANCING OF THE PAD&#13;
The PAD is finnced partly out of loans from donors and partly from self-financing genrted by water setor activity or&#13;
from financing of the temporary cash shorfoll by commercial atnal sources. An interst rate of 10% has been assumed for the&#13;
lans obtained at the commercial banks .&#13;
Donor financing&#13;
Calculation of finann in relation to investnents&#13;
Ivstment financing under the PAD is deamed to be paid on the first day of the corrsponding investment phase&#13;
Interest is calulated on the increase in lending bdween the begunning and the end of the year.&#13;
Financingt rm  by donor&#13;
The following interest rate and tems were used in the projections:&#13;

OPERATING COSTS&#13;
The eslimates of variable operating costs for 1994 supplied by SONEES' Financial Deparnmet are used to determine an&#13;
average unit cost per m3 of water produced. Earlier, those estimated costs were adjusted for sewerage costs amounting to CFAF&#13;
988 million. The oveall sewage  cost has been eliminated from each cost item concened pro rata to the level of costs in each&#13;
case.&#13;

BALANCE SHEET AND INCOM E STATEM&#13;
Te 1993 SW/oP balance sheet and incom  tatment correspond to the financisal sMaemnts certified by SONEES'&#13;
auditor. Th figures used for 1994 are based on the unaudted acouts for 1994.&#13;
FIXED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATION&#13;
Due to the devaluation of the CFA Franc, fixed assls awe rvaued by applying a rauaon rte (40%) to ther vale at&#13;
December 31, 1994. The sa  applies to the depreciation amnt malued at December 31, 1994. A net fixed asset revuation&#13;
gap (equivalent to the gross fixed asset realuation gap less depreciation revaluation gap) is posted on the liabilities side of the&#13;
balance sheet at December 31, 1994. Te revalued amount is t    deprndiated over 10 years which we assune to be the avuage&#13;
remaining economic lIfe of the assets. A deprcatio amount is posted each year, and at the same time a revse depreciation&#13;
ently reduces the revaluation adjustment in the liabilities.&#13;
REVALUATION OF DEBT&#13;
A mechanisn identical to fixed asset revaluation, but in the opposite direction, is applied to SONEES' debts at&#13;
December31, 1994.&#13;
All of SONEES' debts were multiplied by two at December 31, 1993.&#13;
INCREASE IN STAFF COSTS&#13;
Provision is made for two incrases in staff costs, representig salay adjustmes to oiset the consquences of&#13;
devaluation:&#13;
-      increasein 1994: 15%&#13;
-      increase in 1995: 10°/.&#13;
-      increase staring in 1996: 2/. This increase does not catch up with inflatn, but simply represels a&#13;
"normal" increase in the wage bill due to promotions, seniority bonuses, etc. This increase stops in 2001.&#13;
DEPRECIATION AND PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBTS&#13;
These two items are included under operating costs&#13;

SENEGAL&#13;
WATER SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Financing of The Temporary Cash Shortfall (explanatory note)&#13;
Commercial loans by banks and insurance companies&#13;
1.     Two local commercial banks have expressed an interest in principle in providing 7 to 8 year&#13;
loans to SONES for a total principal amount of up to CFA franc 15,000 million at an interest rate of&#13;
approximately 10% p.a. plus the 17% tax on banking transactions. The terms of the loans are: (i) interest&#13;
rate of 10% p.a. plus tax; (ii) final term not to exceed 8 years; (iii) equal semi-annual repayments; (iv)&#13;
front-end fee of 1 to 2% flat.&#13;
2.     The banks have requested that the financing be structured in such a way as to provide comfort to&#13;
the lenders over and above the debt repayment capacity and the balance sheet of the SONES. Specifically,&#13;
SONES would be required to provide irrevocable instructions to SdE to transfer a certain percentage of the&#13;
payments due to SONES directly to an escrow account secured in favor of the lenders. The payments&#13;
made to the escrow account would be used to make the debt service payment on the secured commnercial&#13;
loans. After full repayment of the commercial loan, any fund remaining in the escrow account would&#13;
revert to SONES, and the account would be closed.&#13;
Rescheduling of part of the existing sector debt&#13;
3.     This concerns the existing loans from Kf(W in German Mark for which 50% of the outstanding&#13;
amounts has been canceled by Kf(W. The cancellation of 50% of the Kf(W loans has not been passed. A&#13;
restructuring by the Government of the principal and interest amounts canceled by KfW would reduce the&#13;
cash disbursements of the sector to the Government by CFA franc 4,342 million for the principal and&#13;
interest for the period from 1994 to 2000. The payment of these amounts would be differed until the year&#13;
2001 and repaid in approximately equal installments over a 5 year period thereafter.&#13;
Sale of certain operating assets of SONEES to SdE&#13;
4.     As a condition of negotiations, it has been requested to make a valuation of certain, operating&#13;
assets which would be sold to SdE as the future operator of the water system. The valuation is now being&#13;
made. It is estimated that the sale of these assets would bring at least CFA 2,000 million to SONES.&#13;
55% of IDA credit to the project to fund an equity injection&#13;
5.    the impact of transfer of 55% of the investment portion of the IDA credit to the sector in the form&#13;
of equity is limited since during the period 1995-2000: (i) there is no principal repayment on the IDA&#13;
credit the debt repayment schedule does not call for any reimbursement of principal amounts on the lDA&#13;
credit; and (ii) the interest payments would be be made on that part of the IDA credit during that period&#13;
amount to CFA franc 9,639 million. Accordingly, the impact of that measure on the cash shortfall will&#13;
be only CFA franc 5,301 million.&#13;
50% of KfW loan to the project to fund an equity injection&#13;
6.     The impact of the transfer of 50% of the investment portion of the KfNW loan to the sector in the&#13;
form of equity is also limited for the same reasons as in the above paragraph. The 5% interest payments&#13;
which would be be made on that part of the KfW loan during that period amount to CFA franc 2,592&#13;
million. Accordingly, the impact of that measure on the cash shortfall will be only CFA franc 1,296&#13;
million.&#13;
Other options examined and rejected&#13;
6.     In the study which was conducted at the request of IDA, several additional options were&#13;
examined and subsequently rejected for specific reasons. A summary of these options can be found on the&#13;
following pages.&#13;

La grille d'evaluation de l'exploitation est reniplie annuellement par 1'exploitant avec les donnees de l'annee ecoul&amp;e. La colonne Critere donne pour les diff6rents indicateuvs le chiffre qui figure dans le&#13;
contrat d'affenrage. Pour les critdres d'6valuations qui ne sont pas repris conune indicateurs darns le contrat, le nornbre repris donne la situation de la SONEES pendant l'ann6e 1994. La colonne Critre (%/6)&#13;
reprend les chiffr qui sont exprimes en % danm la prenuere colonne et indique un % 6gal a 100 pour les indicateurs exprim6s en nombre. La colorme realisation est exprim6e en % par rapport a la colonme&#13;
critere. La colonne Ponderation donne 1'ecnelle d'importance aitribuec s chaque critere. Le chiffre inscrit est a multiplier pour chaque critere par ce nombre pour obtenir le r6sultat Les resultats sont&#13;
additionnes par groupes A, B, C, D, E et repris dans le tableau recapitulatif. Si, pour l'ensemble des critres, 1'exploitant respecte les obligations, le r6sultat fmnal est zero. S'il fait mieux que l'obligation&#13;
impos6e, le total eat un chiffre positif. S'il fait moins bien, le resultat est un chiffre n6gatif. La grille permettra a la SONES d'avoir un apercu de la qualite de l'exploitation, ce qui constitue une indication&#13;
gan6rale mais ne dispense en ricn l'exploitant de respecter toutes les autres obligations pr6vues dans le contrat. La grille est reffplie par 1'exploitant sur la base des chiffres qu'il a fournis pendant l'ann6e dans&#13;
les rapports a la SONES. L'exploitant doit transmettre des grilles a la SONES avant Ic 30 janvier de l'ann6e suivant 1'exercice.&#13;

WATER SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Economic Evaluation&#13;
The EIRR of the proposed water supply project was calculated for the stream of net&#13;
incremental benefits resulting from the project. Incremental net benefits are defined as the&#13;
difference between the net benefits of water services in the scenario in which both the project and&#13;
the institutional reform program are implemented, and the net benefits of water services in the&#13;
scenario in which neither the project nor the reform is implemented.&#13;
Costs. The incremental costs of the project include the fixed and variable operating costs&#13;
for water supply as well as the cost of water supply investments. For the purpose of the economnic&#13;
evaluation, incremental financial operating costs were adjusted to eliminate taxes, interest and the&#13;
depreciation allowance. Adjusting for the shadow wage rate for skilled and unskilled labor in the&#13;
Dakar area resulted in no change in incremental costs because the project will be implemented&#13;
without any increase in staff. The exchange rate was assumed to be in equilibrium as a result of&#13;
the 1994 devaluation.&#13;
Benefits. Incremental revenues from the sale of water were taken as a proxy for direct use&#13;
benefits. In addition, consumer surplus due to the increase in the volume of water consumed was&#13;
estimated based on an assumed price elasticity of -.2 and a linear demand curve in the relevant&#13;
range of the incremental volume consumed with the project.&#13;
Economic Internal Rate of Retuirn. The EIRR of the water supply project as a whole is&#13;
14.1 percent. Sensitivity analyses yielded the following results:&#13;
Assumption                                                    EIRR&#13;
A 10 percent increase in operating costs                      13.8 %&#13;
A 10 percent increase in investment costs                     12.7 %&#13;
A 10 percent increase in total costs                          12.5 %&#13;
A 15 percent increase in operating costs                      13.7 %&#13;
A 15 percent increase in investment costs                     12.1 %&#13;
A 15 percent increase in total costs                          11.8 %&#13;
EIRR of the Prod2uction Component. The investments in water supply production capacity&#13;
were evaluated separately. The EIRR of this component is 17.0 percent.&#13;
Average Incremental Cost. AIC/m3 was calculated by dividing the present value of the&#13;
stream of incremental costs by the present value of the stream of the incremental volume of water&#13;
sold, using a discount rate of 10 percent. AIC is estimated at CFAF 550/m3.&#13;
Details of the economic analysis are shown in the following table.&#13;

WATER SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Assessment and Mitigation Plan&#13;
Background&#13;
The proposed project was placed in environmental screening category B as consistent with&#13;
the provisions of the Operational Directive 4.01, Annex E: Environmental Assessment. A detailed&#13;
environmental analysis (see Project File) showed that the project would affect the environment&#13;
positively, particularly in the area of public health. The environmental impact assessment study&#13;
was carried out in August 1990, updated in 1995, and has been made available to the public and to&#13;
all parties concerned.&#13;
The survey of the impacts of the 3rd water project upon the environment was camied&#13;
during two missions to Dakar, from June 13 to 24, 1994 and from February 8 to 24, 1995&#13;
respectively. The key ministries and institutions involved in utilization of water resources in the&#13;
Cap Vert region were approached, especially the Ministry of Hydraulics, SONEES, and the Cayor&#13;
Canal mission. The consultants also made field visits to the most significant wellfields,&#13;
construction sites and pipeline routes of the proposed project.&#13;
The environmnental analysis includes the following two main aspects: (i) impacts of the&#13;
intermediate exploitation of the pertinent groundwater resources, (ii) consequences of the&#13;
construction activities. As a third aspect (iii) the sanitary and health impacts of the project have&#13;
been addressed as the human living conditions also are important environmental aspects of the&#13;
project. Environmental impacts are not necessarily negative, and the analysis also emphasis&#13;
positive effects, as well as appropriate measures to deal with the unfavorable effects of the project.&#13;
A summary of the main environmental impacts and proposed abatement measures are summarzed&#13;
in a table at the end of this Appendix.&#13;
Impacts on Groundwater Resources&#13;
North Coastal Aquifer&#13;
In 1992 a simulation of the changes in groundwater regimes in the North Coastal Aquifer&#13;
based on BRGM's groundwater model was carried out. This simulation demonstrated that the&#13;
amount of groundwater abstracted for from the additional boreholes (35,000 m3/day) will not&#13;
affect the north-south piezometric dome which protects the North Coastal ground-water table&#13;
against the invasion of salt water. The effect of the new boreholes will only be felt on the Gueoul-&#13;
Thies line i.e. near the layout zone, where the induced drop should be around 2.5 to 5 meters over&#13;
15 years, which is considered acceptable taking into account the depth of the aquifer. As a&#13;
conclusiol the impact of the planned additional abstraction from the North Coastal Aquifer of&#13;
35,000 m /day will be moderate. However, it should be pointed out that under the current climatic&#13;
conditions, the resource of the North Coast is not perennial and the implementation of a long-term&#13;
supply project, like the Cayor canal, should make it possible to reduce the water drawn off.&#13;
&#13;

The Groundwater Resources in the Cap Vert Region&#13;
The groundwater resources in the Cap Vert region are a justified subject of concern, since&#13;
a considerable drop in the water level of some of the aquifers has been observed. This depletion is&#13;
claimed to be a result from the current groundwater exploitation at the peninsula, and from the&#13;
limestone aquifers of Pout and Sebikotane. The amount of water pumped out of these groundwater&#13;
systems exceeds by far the rates of natural recharge. Hence, additional abstraction of water from&#13;
these sources must be accompanied by an intensive monitoring program including piezometric and&#13;
water quality changes. It will be possible to maintain this amount of abstraction in the interim&#13;
phase as long as piezometric evolution are followed up regularly and critically together with the&#13;
chlorine contents, sign of a possible intrusion by salt water. The above stated facts underscores the&#13;
importance of only allowing abstraction of water from these sources as a provisional solution, and&#13;
it would be totally unacceptable to tap these water resources beyond a period of 10 or 20 years.&#13;
As a result of the above mentioned concerns the project has to be accompanied by a series&#13;
of mitigation measures (included in the proposed project), such as: (i) creation of 21 supplementary&#13;
piezometers; (ii) strengthening of SGPRE, so as to follow up on a monthly basis 101 piezometric&#13;
measuring stations including the 21 new piezometers; (iii) establish a forecast model for the&#13;
groundwater regime of the North Coastal Aquifer, in order to monitor changes compared to the&#13;
forecasts, which will be the responsibility of the SGPRE; (iv) institutionalization of a system for&#13;
monitoring the real groundwater abstraction by the various users, and develop regulations for&#13;
restricting the quotas.&#13;
To some extent the recommendations and compensatory measures is proposed to include:&#13;
(i) establishment of routine cleaning of the Panthior Dam to improve the recharge of the Sebikotane&#13;
ground-water table; (ii) a preliminary survey to develop other groundwater recharge measures; (iii)&#13;
a budget provision to enable compensation for declined groundwater levels of several village wells&#13;
near the new wellfields on the North Coast. Alternative measures would be deepening of the wells&#13;
or connection to the piped water systems.&#13;
Impacts of Construction Activities&#13;
The environmental problems that may occur during the construction period can be&#13;
minimized through careful management of operation of equipment and handling of materials,&#13;
especially waste materials. It should be noted that some temporary effects can have more severe&#13;
lasting effects, such as contamination of soil and water, if care is not taken. The appropriate action&#13;
and responsibilities which be undertaken during project implementation are included.&#13;
For all the mitigating measures related to the drilling of boreholes and construction of the&#13;
pumping stations, transmission pipelines, storage basins, access roads, and distribution systems,&#13;
the emphasis will be on a systematic consultation with local communities and users groups in order&#13;
to develop a participatory approach and raise the environmental awareness through the educational&#13;
program, which will be developed as part of the project.&#13;
Three particular impacts that are worth mentioning at this stage are: (i) the crossing of the&#13;
Pikine - Dagoudane - Thiaroye built-up area will require particular attention concerning the work&#13;
on the site in order to minimize the effects of nuisance upon the populations; (ii) the construction of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 5&#13;
the Mamelles reservoir is in a sensitive area; (iii) crossing a number of the "market gardening"&#13;
properties may interrupt the horticulture production.&#13;
The main recommendations made in this study concern: (i) the need to establish particular&#13;
technical arrangements on the site for contractor; (ii) consulting when crossing dense urban zones&#13;
is involved, such as rapid backfilling of trenches, maintained access to homes, and other safety&#13;
precautions to protect the people concerned; (iii) the need to pay attention to the localization of the&#13;
Manelles reservoir to fit the natural topology of the site; (iv) the need to provide for financial&#13;
compensation in the event of temporary market garden production loss; (v) the need to ensure&#13;
repair of the sites for crossing the registered forest of Pout and the reforestation of the perimeter of&#13;
Mbaw.&#13;
Sanitary Impacts&#13;
Today's maximum supply capacity (202,000 m3/day) is rarely obtained and does not, in&#13;
any case, meet the current demand. Water shortages in the Dakar region are chronic, leading to&#13;
degradation of the environment and health risks associated with an intermittent drinking water&#13;
supply. A 34 percent increase in supply, as a result of the proposed project, will notably improve&#13;
the supply of safe drinking water to the people living in the city of Dakar, as well as those living in&#13;
the peri-urban areas, where water bome diseases are endemic. The project will serve districts&#13;
where inhabitants do not have access to adequate water supply today, hence the impacts for the&#13;
populations concemed will be positive. However, some shortage of water will continue and the gap&#13;
between demand and supply will continue to broaden during the interim phase.&#13;
Unless proper measures are being taken, there is a risk of increased pollution of nitrates&#13;
and bacteria in the groundwater of Thiaroye caused by the rapidly increasing urbanization. The&#13;
current nitrate concentrations are already very high (150 to 300 mgll) and therefore, it is advisable&#13;
to: (i) maintain the current device to dilute the local drinking water to reduce the nitrate&#13;
concentration before it supplied to the consumers by connection to ALG 1; (ii) carefully monitor the&#13;
nitrate contents and their bacteriological levels.&#13;
The proposed 34 percent increase in water supplied to Dakar would also increase the&#13;
amount of wastewater which will require treatment and disposal. The disposal and treatment of&#13;
wastewater should, therefor, be considered at the same time as the supply of potable water. The&#13;
increased amount of water supplied by the project will mainly go to areas with low population&#13;
density, where the soil conditions are favorable for infiltration of wastewater via septic tanks or&#13;
seepage pits. The densely populated areas of Dakar are furmished with sewerage systems connected&#13;
to a sewage treatment plant with over-capacity compared to the current amounts of sewage. This&#13;
spare capacity can be utilized to treat additional sewage resulting from increased water supply&#13;
capacity. Hence, there should be no notable risk of increased pollution caused by discharge of&#13;
sewage in the sea. In addition small-scale municipal wastewater plants will be built for&#13;
pretreatment of sewage used for irrigation purposes.&#13;
In the secondary urban centers emphasizes is placed on coordination of water supply and&#13;
wastewater disposal measures. Therefore the Water Sector Project includes preparation of&#13;
sewerage master plans for 19 centers recently provided with new water supplies. This also include&#13;
information programs the enhance people's awareness about wastewater disposal problems and the&#13;
need for keeping water, sewage and drainage works in good condition.&#13;

Washington.&#13;
Monsieur le President,&#13;
Suite aux negociations du Projet Sectoriel Eau du Senegal en vue de sa presentation au Conseil&#13;
d'Administration de l'IDA en Juin 1995, nous voudrions par la presente lettre vous reaffirmer les&#13;
grandes lignes de la politique sectorielle du Gouvernement pour l'hydraulique urbaine et&#13;
l'assainissement. Ce secteur auquel le Senegal attache une grande priorite, joue un r6le important&#13;
dans le developpement economique et social de notre pays. La lettre presente la situation actuelle&#13;
du secteur ainsi que les strategies adoptees pour la realisation des objectifs du Projet Sectoriel Eau&#13;
finance par l'IDA et d'autres partenaires au developpement.&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
La maitrise des ressources en eau, la preservation de la Sante des populations ainsi que la&#13;
protection de l'environnement, constituent des objectifs majeurs que le Senegal s'est assignb dans le&#13;
cadre de sa politique de d6veloppement economique et social. Pour les atteindre des actions&#13;
importantes ont e  realisees au cours des dernieres decennies. Toutefois, des besoins importants&#13;
restent a couvrir dans les domaines de la gestion de la ressource, de l'approvisionnement en eau&#13;
potable et de l'assainissement.&#13;
2. SITUATION ACTUELLE DU SECTEUR&#13;
Les elements caracteristiques de la situation actuelle du secteur de i'hydraulique se presentent&#13;
comme suit:&#13;
2.1. Gestion des Ressources en Eau&#13;
Plusieurs etudes ont e  menees au cours des dernieres annees en vue d'une meilleure connaissance&#13;
des ressources en eau et de la definition d'une strategie adequate pour la gestion de celles-ci. Ces&#13;
etudes ont et accompagnees de la mise en place de reseaux de surveillance comprenant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;

aujourd'hui, 450 piezometres couvrant la quasi totalite des principaux aquiferes et 72 stations&#13;
hydrometriques installees sur les differents cours d'eau du pays.&#13;
En outre, des efforts importants de modernisation des outils de gestion des ressources ont e&#13;
entrepris avec notamment la mise en oeuvre du Projet de Planification des Ressources en Eau&#13;
financd par le PNUD.&#13;
2.2. Hydraulipue Urbaine&#13;
Les caracteristiques essentielles du sous-secteur de l'hydraulique urbaine se presentent conume suit&#13;
. nombre de centres geres:  48&#13;
. population totale concernee:  3.200.000 hbts&#13;
. capacite totale de production: 96 millions m3/an&#13;
. volume totale des ventes:  67,1 millions m3/an&#13;
. rendement technique moyen des reseaux: 73 %&#13;
. nombre d'abonnes:         220.000.&#13;
Il faut signaler que le sous - secteur de l'hydraulique urbaine se caracterise par une situation&#13;
d6ficitaire dans l'agglomeration dakaroise. En effet pour une demande en eau de l'ordre de 300.000&#13;
M3/j la production au profit de Dakar toume autour de 200.000 m3/j. En ce qui concerne les centres&#13;
de l'interieur, la production couvre entierement les besoins.&#13;
2.3. Assainissement&#13;
Le sous-secteur de l'assainissement n'a pas connu le meme developpement que celui de&#13;
l'approvisionnement en eau potable. Ce retard se situe aussi bien au niveau du cadre institutionnel&#13;
qu'a celui de la satisfaction des besoins d'investissement. Par ailleurs plusieurs organismes&#13;
participent actuellement a la gestion des activites relevant de l'assainissement.&#13;
Actuellement, seules six (6) villes du pays disposent de systemes acceptables d'assainissement.&#13;
Dakar, Saint-Louis, Thies, Kaolack, Louga et Saly Portudal. II convient de noter que ces&#13;
installations, qui offrent une capacite globale de traitement de pres de 15.000 m3/j, demeurent sous-&#13;
utilisees a cause du faible taux de raccordement des particuliers resultant du cout 6leve des&#13;
branchements individuels a l'egout. Le nombre total des abonnes raccordes au reseau&#13;
d'assainissement n'atteint pas 50.000 dans l'ensemble des villes assainies.&#13;
3. STRATEGIE DE DEVELOPPEMENT DU SECTEUR DE L'HYDRAULIOUE&#13;
La strategie elaboree pour le developpement du secteur de l'hydraulique urbaine et de&#13;
l'assainissement repose sur une triple preoccupation, a savoir, (i) parvenir a l'equilibre financier du&#13;
secteur en vue d'assurer sa perennite, (ii) impliquer le secteur prive dans la gestion du service&#13;
public de l'eau, (iii) limiter l'incidence des mesures a portee 6conomique sur les revenus des&#13;
menages. Elle avait recueilli l'aval des partenaires au developpement du Sendgal lors de la reunion&#13;
des bailleurs de fonds tenue a Dakar en Juin 1990 qui etait le cadre de reaffirmation des options&#13;
fondamentales prises pour le secteur de l'Hydraulique.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 8&#13;
107                                  Page 3 of 19&#13;
Cette strategie devrait permettre d'ici a la fin de la decennie, (i) de parvenir a une gestion&#13;
rationnelle et a une protection efficace des ressources en eau, (ii) de renforcer les systemes&#13;
d'alimentation en eau potable et d'assainissement, (iii) d'ameliorer le cadre de vie des populations.&#13;
De facon specifique, cette strategie se resume comme suit:&#13;
a /- En ce qui concerne la gestion des ressources en eau, les axes retenus s'articulent autour d'une&#13;
meilleure connaissance et d'une protection efficace des ressources en eau, et de la mise en place&#13;
d'un cadre institutionnel approprie de concertation et de prise de decision garantissant une gestion&#13;
globale et coherente des ressources.&#13;
b/ - Dans le domaine de l'hydraulique urbaine, la strategie definie vise a la fois: (i) I'amelioration&#13;
de la maintenance et de l'entretien des 6quipements, (ii) I'augmentation de la production d'eau&#13;
potable pour la region de Dakar, (iii) le renforcement institutionnel et financier du secteur en vue de&#13;
retablir son equilibre.&#13;
c/ - Pour le sous-secteur de l'assainissement, les actions strategiques ci-apres sont privilegiees:&#13;
la poursuite de l'equipement des centres urbains en infrastructures d'assainissement sur&#13;
la base de plans strategiques bien definis, tenant compte de toutes les options&#13;
envisageables, la rentabilisation, la rehabilitation et le renforcement des installations;&#13;
le traitement et la reutilisation des eaux usees;&#13;
I'accroissement des branchements domiciliaires a l'egout et la promotion  de&#13;
l'assainissement autonome chaque fois qu'il peut apporter une solution acceptable.&#13;
Enfin, pour atteindre les objectifs qu'il s'est fixe dans le secteur de l'Hydraulique et de&#13;
l'Assainissement le Gouvernement du Senegal a initie en etroite collaboration avec ses partenaires&#13;
au developpement un vaste programme d'investissements dont la piece maitresse est le "Projet&#13;
Sectoriel Eau".&#13;
4. PROJET SECTORIEL EAU.&#13;
4.1. Obiectifs du Proeet Sectoriel Eau.&#13;
Le Projet Sectoriel Eau s'inscrit parfaitement dans la politique de developpement economique et&#13;
social du pays, et vise notamment les objectifs suivants:&#13;
a/ - Ameliorer la gestion du secteur de l'eau, en particulier le recouvrement des couits relatifs au&#13;
sous-secteur de l'Hydraulique Urbaine et reduire sa d6pendance vis- a -vis du Budget de l'Etat afin&#13;
d'assurer sa viabilite financiere;&#13;
b/ - Reduire le deficit de l'alimentation en eau de la Region de Dakar et ameliorer l'acces a l'eau&#13;
potable et a l'assainissement dans les zones defavorisees des centres urbains;&#13;
c/ - Assurer une meilleure adequation entre besoins et ressources en eau. et definir une strategie&#13;
globale et coherente de gestion de ces ressources;&#13;
&#13;

4.2.3. Reformes institutionnelles et mesures d'accompagnement&#13;
a) Reforme du sous-secteur de l'hydrauligue urbaine&#13;
La reforme du sous-secteur de l'Hydraulique Urbaine vise la mise en place d'un cadre institutionnel&#13;
approprie garantissant la viabilite financiere dudit sous-secteur. Elle s'articule autour de trois&#13;
acteurs dont les attributions sont les suivantes:&#13;
I'Etat dont les principales missions dans le sous-secteur de I'Hydraulique Urbaine se presentent&#13;
comme suit:&#13;
- la definition de la politique sectorielle;&#13;
- la gestion des ressources en eau et la police des eaux;&#13;
- I'elaboration d'un cadre legislatif et reglementaire;&#13;
- I'approbation du systeme de tarification.&#13;
Une Societe Nationale de Patrimoine (SONES, creee en Avril 1995) chargee de:&#13;
- la gestion du patrimoine : mise en valeur, amortissernent et service de la dette;&#13;
- la programmation des investissements et la recherche de financement;&#13;
- la mailtrise d'ouvrage des travaux de renouvellement de l'infrastructure;&#13;
- la maitrise d'ouvrage des travaux de rehabilitation de reseau;&#13;
- la maitrise d'ouvrage des travaux d'extension de l'infrastructure;&#13;
- la sensibilisation du public;&#13;
- le contr6le de la qualite de l'exploitation.&#13;
Une Societe Privee d'Exploitation (SdE) chargee:&#13;
- de l'exploitation et l'entretien de l'infrastructure et du materiel d'exploitation;&#13;
- du renouvellement du materiel d'exploitation et des compteurs;&#13;
- du renouvellement du reseau et des branchements;&#13;
- de l'extension des reseaux financee par des tiers;&#13;
- de l'etude et la justification de la necessite de renouvellement et d'extension de&#13;
l'infrastructure;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- du recouvrement des factures d'eau potable et de la redevance assainissement;&#13;
- de la communication et des relations avec la clientele.&#13;
L'appel d'offres de la SdE sera lance avant la fin du mois de Juin 1995, en vue de l'etablissement&#13;
de la societe au plus tard a la fin de l'annee 1995.&#13;
b) Reforme du sous-secteur de l'assainissement&#13;
La reforme institutionnelle du sous-secteur de l'assainissement urbain vise la reorganisation du&#13;
cadre institutionnel et la mise en place d'un Office National de l'Assainissement (ONAS) autonome&#13;
ayant l'entiere responsabilite de gestion des activites liees a l'assainissement (eaux usees). Ces&#13;
activites seront financees par la surtaxe d'assainissement collectee par la SdE sur les factures&#13;
d'eau et reversee a l'ONAS. La reforme du sous-secteur de l'assainissement sera mise en place en&#13;
meme temps que celle de l'hydraulique urbaine.&#13;
c) Mesures d'accompagnement&#13;
Gestion des ressources en eau: Le Projet Sectoriel Eau comporte un important volet visant&#13;
l'elaboration d'un plan strategique national de gestion des ressources en eau. Ce plan sera axe&#13;
d'une part, sur une meilleure connaissance des ressources, une protection efficace de celles-ci et&#13;
d'autre part, sur la mise en place d'un cadre institutionnel approprie de concertation et de prise de&#13;
decision. II contribuera a la preparation de la solution a long terme pour l'approvisionnement en&#13;
eau potable de la region de Dakar. Le plan strategique permettra egalement la realisation d'etudes,&#13;
notamment:&#13;
- etudes hydrologiques et hydrogeologiques (en complement du projet PNUD en cours);&#13;
- etude institutionnelle relative au programme de revitalisation des "Vallees Fossiles";&#13;
- etude de preconception sur la r6utilisation des eaux usees en zone urbaine;&#13;
Plans d'actions: Pour garantir la reussite des reformes et assurer la viabilite financiere de&#13;
l'hydraulique urbaine et de l'assainissement, plusieurs mesures administratives et financieres ont&#13;
ete retenues.&#13;
*      Pour la reduction de l'usage de l'eau potable a des fins agricoles (annexe 1): (i)&#13;
I'application des Juillet 1995 d'une nouvelle grille tarifaire aux maraichers, basee&#13;
sur un prix moyen de 100 FCFA par m3, (ii) I'application du cofit marginal a&#13;
partir de 1998 et du tarif plein a l'an 2005. La mise en oeuvre de cette derniere&#13;
mesure suppose la disponibilite de ressources alternatives (eaux usees recyclees&#13;
pour 1998 et disponibilite d'eau apres la realisation de la solution a long terme&#13;
pour l'AEP de Dakar a l'horizon 2005), (iii) a partir du 30 juin 1995, la&#13;
suppression de l'octroi de nouveaux quotas d'eau potable aux maraichers, (iv)&#13;
elaboration et mise en oeuvre d'une campagne de promotion et de vulgarisation&#13;
de techniques d'irrigation plus efficaces permettant d'economiser l'eau. Bien&#13;
entendu, les maraichers restent dans le droit commun seront traites comme tout&#13;
autre abonnes par la SdE (coupures en cas d'arrieres de paiement). La&#13;
problenatique du maraichage sera reexaminee en 1998 au cours de l'evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 7 of 19&#13;
de la premiere phase du projet. Cette revue se fera sur la base d'une approche&#13;
multisectorielle tenant compte des resultats de deux annees d'application du plan&#13;
d'actions.&#13;
*      Pour la reduction des consommations d'eau des Administrations Publiques et&#13;
des etablissements a caractere administratif (annexe 2a): (i) la mise a jour et&#13;
la centralisation du fichier des abonnes administratifs, (ii) I'elaboration des&#13;
budgets sur la base de pr6visions realistes des consommnations, (iii) le&#13;
renouvellement des reseaux d'eau interieurs, des branchements et des&#13;
compteurs des services de l'Administration Publique. Ce plan d'action vise a&#13;
reduire de 70% des pertes d'eau dues aux fuites et au gaspillage, pour&#13;
degager un gain de 10 000 m3/j.   Compte tenu de ces economies&#13;
substantielles d'eau et de leur impact sur les quantit6s qui seront ainsi&#13;
disponibles pour d'autres consommateurs, la mise en oeuvre rapide du plan&#13;
est d'une importance primordiale. C'est pourquoi il est prevu sur le PPF du&#13;
projet, un financement destine aux mesures preparatoires (diagnostic des&#13;
reseaux internes des Administrations, appui logistique pour la centralisation&#13;
des fichiers de consommations, etc). Les travaux de rehabilitation de r6seaux&#13;
constituent 6galement une composante specifique de la premiere phase du&#13;
projet.&#13;
*      Concernant le paiement a bonne date des factures d'eau des administrations&#13;
publiques et des etablissements a caractere administratif (annexe 2b), les&#13;
procedures de certification et de liquidation seront limitees a deux (2) mois. Ce&#13;
qui avec une facturation bimestrielle, permet d'atteindre l'objectif d'un credit&#13;
client ne depassant pas 4 mois des 1996.&#13;
Plan de suivi environnemental, le Projet Sectoriel Eau prevoit le renforcement des moyens de&#13;
surveillance et de suivi des nappes et des eaux de surface. Toutes les mesures d'attenuation des&#13;
imnpacts negatifs, recommandees par les etudes environnementales, ont ete retenues. En ce qui&#13;
conceme particulierement les aquiferes du littoral nord il est prevu: (i) l'arret des pr6levements&#13;
supplementaires d'eau des 2005, (ii) la densification du reseau piezometrique de surveillance, (iii)&#13;
I'application d'une penalite a la SdE pour l'inciter a exploiter l'usine de Ngnith a sa capacite&#13;
maximale et le littoral nord au debit autoris, (iv) le raccordement aux conduites d'eau, des villages&#13;
dont les puits sont susceptibles d'etre affectes par les nouveaux prelevements.&#13;
Equilibre financier du secteur: Le Gouvemement du Senegal s'engage a assurer l'equilibre&#13;
financier du sous-secteur de l'eau potable en 2003. A cet egard, des augmentations tarifaires&#13;
annuelles en termes reels sont prevues. Le premier ajustement interviendra des le ler Juillet 1995.&#13;
La grille tarifaire sera r6vis6e en 1998 en tenant compte des indications pertinentes fournies par&#13;
l'etude sur la structure de la demande a mener par la SONES au cours de la premiere phase du&#13;
projet.&#13;

PLANS D'ACTIONS: REDUCTION DE L'USAGE D'EAU POTABLE POUR&#13;
L'IIRRIGATION&#13;
Considerations Preliminaires&#13;
1.     Ce plan d'action s'inscrit dans le cadre des deux etudes effectuees l'une en niai et l'autre&#13;
en septembre 1994 sur la fourniture d'une eau potable pour l'irrigation des cultures horticoles&#13;
(maraichage, arboriculture et floriculture) dans la region des Niayes entre Thies et Dakar. II vise a&#13;
assurer a terme la fin de la distribution par la SdE de 1'eau potable au secteur horticole pour la&#13;
destiner en priorite a l'alimentation de la region de Dakar. II preconise differentes mesures etalees&#13;
dans le temps pour reajuster immediatement le tarif, ameliorer rapidement les systemes d'irrigation&#13;
et appliquer, au moyen terme un tarif base sur le couit marginal de production de 1'eau et a plus&#13;
long terme (horizon 2005) un tarif maraicher base sur le cout d'opportunite de l'eau potable. Le&#13;
plan d'actions conine tous les autres el6ments du projet sectoriel eau fera l'objet d'une revue en&#13;
1998. Cette revue permettra de redefinir selon une approche multisectorielle, la problematique du&#13;
maraichage dans la region des Niayes.&#13;
2.      Le plan d'action etablit une nouvelle grille tarifaire applicable aux maralchers, a compter&#13;
du Ier Juillet 1995. Tl prevoit des mesures tendant:&#13;
*     A l'application d'un tarif maraicher egal au cout d'opportunite de l'eau, lie a la&#13;
fourniture alternative et plus appropriee d'eau;&#13;
*     au paiement a bonne date des factures d'eau avec un taux de recouvrement analogue&#13;
a celui atteint aupres des consommateurs autres que les producteurs horticoles ; et&#13;
-     a la rationalisation des techniques d'irrigation en vue de reduire les pertes et les&#13;
gaspillages d'eau par la mise en oeuvre rapide et progressive d'un programme.&#13;
3.      Toute politique de l'eau dans les Niayes doit etre la recherche des moyens les plus&#13;
rationnels d'utilisation de la ressource en vue du maintien de l'activite economique dans la region.&#13;
Elle devra se fonder sur:&#13;
*     l'acquisition de donnees fiables et;&#13;
*     la mise en place d'un mecanisme de suivi et d'evaluation, permettant d'apprecier la&#13;
necessite d'une reorientation des actions entreprises.&#13;
Actions et Proeramme&#13;
Application de la nouvelle grille tarifaire et recouvrement des factures d'eau&#13;
4.      L'application de la nouvelle grille tarifaire (copie ci-joint) des le 15 Juin 1995 et le&#13;
recouvrement efficace des factures d'eau se fera selon le schema ci-dessous:&#13;

Page 9 of l9&#13;
5.     L'application de la nouvelle grille devrait en principe dans un premier temps r6duire les&#13;
pertes supportees actuellement par la SONEES pour chaque metre cube d'eau produite et ficturie&#13;
aux maraichers. Cette augmentation du tarif devrait 6galement sensibiliser les utilisateurs i unc&#13;
meilleure gestion de l'eau qui est une ressource rare et chere.&#13;
6.     Un tarif plus r6aliste compte tenu de l'eventail des charges de production et des&#13;
opportunites de vente sur le marche int6rieur ou a 1'exportation a e  propose. 11 comporte une&#13;
tranche basse qui concerne les petits maraichers et une tranche nonnale pour les gros maraichers&#13;
(voir grille en annexe). L'application de ce nouveau tarif des le 15 juin 1995 pernettra de poser les&#13;
nouvelles regles de facturation avant le commencement de la prochaine campagne de production&#13;
pour l'exportation qui devrait commencer apres la fin de la saison des pluies. Le respect de cette&#13;
date est donc imperatif pour clarifier la nouvelle donne avant la mise en place de la prochaine&#13;
campagne.&#13;
7.     Le meilleur recouvrement des factures d'eau des maraichers programnim  a partir de 1996&#13;
par la SdE traduit une volont6 de l'Etat de faire respecter la politique tarifaire et donc de permettre&#13;
a la SdE d'appliquer les sanctions prevues pour penaliser les mauvais payeurs. Le systeme de&#13;
facturation actuel par bimestre n'est pas remis en cause. Cette disposition sera incluse dans le&#13;
contrat d'affermage.&#13;
8.     A partir de 1998, il sera applique aux maraichers un tarif base sur le couit marginal de&#13;
production d'eau potable.&#13;
9.     En 2005, le couit d'opportunite de l'eau sera applique. La mise en oeuvre de ces deux&#13;
dernieres mesures est liee a la solution long terme et a la disponibilit de ressources alternatives.&#13;
Rationalisation des Praticues d'Irrization&#13;
10.    La reduction progressive de la part de consommation d'eau potable vendue aux&#13;
producteurs horticoles en general, et maraichers en particulier, doit egalement resulter d'une&#13;
adoption de techniques d'irrigation amrliorees.&#13;
1l.    Le plan d'actions envisage s'articule autour de deux axes: (i) la prevulgarisation des&#13;
nouvelles techniques, (ii) diffusion des pratiques appropriees d'irrigation et formation des&#13;
maraichers.&#13;
Prevulgarisation&#13;
12.    Elle vise les objectifs suivants:&#13;
*    tester de maniere pragmatique et effective, sur le terrain, des equipements et des&#13;
pratiques d'irrigation avec un bon potentiel d'appropriation par les producteurs&#13;
locaux;&#13;
*    cerner les divers problemes susceptibles de se poser dans l'application des m6thodes&#13;
et proposer des solutions realistes;&#13;
*    choisir finalement les techniques appropriees apres une analyse consequente des&#13;
reactions des producteurs face aux innovations propos6es;&#13;
*    definir le dispositif final a envisager pour la mise en place d'une operation de&#13;
diffusion effective des pratiques dans la region des Niayes en consideration.&#13;
&#13;

114                             Annex 8&#13;
Page 10 of 19&#13;
13.    L'opCration de vulgarisation sera conque et appliquee par le Ministere de l'Agriculture&#13;
avec la collaboration etroite de la SONES et la SdE. Le plan d'action propose les activites&#13;
suivantes avec les modalites organisationnelles de leur execution:&#13;
*    conception de l'operation de prevulgarisation par collaboration etroite entre le&#13;
Gouvemement senegalais (Services du Ministere de l'Hydraulique et de&#13;
l'Agriculture), la SONES, la SdE et les maraichers. Les bailleurs de fonds mettront&#13;
A disposition l'expertise necessaire devant assister l'operation;&#13;
*    selection de producteurs quotataires pour la mise en oeuvre de I'operation. Ces&#13;
producteurs doivent ere representatifs des divers types d'exploitations quotataires et&#13;
avoir un potentiel propre a assurer la reussite de la diffusion de l'equipement et des&#13;
pratiques d'irrigation appropries;&#13;
*    en collaboration avec la SdE, la SONES fournira la liste exhaustive actualisee des&#13;
producteurs quotataires avec la taille et la localisation des diverses exploitations.&#13;
(disposition A inclure dans le contrat d'affermage). Cette operation vise egalement A&#13;
la constitution d'un systeme d'information geographique operationnel relatif a&#13;
l'activite horticole dans la region des Niayes. La realisation pratique de ce systeme&#13;
d'information geographique peut etre confiee au Ministere de l'Hydraulique qui&#13;
dispose d'un service competent en la matiere, la SGPRE en l'occurrence. Etant&#13;
donne la proportion importante des exploitations traditionnelles fnailiales, il est&#13;
souhaitable de considerer au moins un nombre egal au 2/3 des producteurs&#13;
selectionnes pour l'operation de pr6vulgarisation pour ce type d'exploitation. Le&#13;
restant est A repartir entre les exploitations moyennes et industrielles quotataires.&#13;
*    choix des systemes d'irrigation appropries. Compte tenu des criteres de taille et&#13;
d'organisation des diverses exploitations quotataires, et du degr6 de technicite du&#13;
producteur et des parametres de culture et de qualite d'eau, il sera considere les&#13;
systemes d'irrigation suivants:&#13;
a)   le bassin d'arrosage en vue d'ameliorer le systeme d'irrigation l'arrosoir;&#13;
b)   l'irrigation localisee (goute A goute, etc.).&#13;
14.    Le projet prevoit le financement de missions d'expertise pour la dsfinition et le choix de&#13;
systemes d'irrigation appropriees et d'actions d'accompagnement (formation).&#13;
15.    Les organisations des producteurs assureront I'encadrement commercial et de gestion avec&#13;
si necessaire l'appui des ONG et/ou de l'Etat.&#13;
Diffusion des nratiaues a3proprikes d'irriaation et formation&#13;
16.    L'analyse des resultats de l'operation de prevulgarisation doit permettre de lever les&#13;
contraintes majeures pour autoriser la diffusion progressive des pratiques d'irrigation efficaces et&#13;
effectives en mati6re de reduction des pertes et du gaspillage d'eau des la campagne horticole&#13;
suivante.&#13;
17.    L'operation  de diffusion  sera menee par le Ministere de l'Agriculture  a partir&#13;
d'exploitations bien ciblees. le systeme d'inforiation geographique requis au cours de l'op6ration&#13;
de prevulgarisation fournira un excellent outil d'aide a la decision en la matiere. L'effort de&#13;
diffusion doit etre maintenu jusqu'A l'atteinte de l'autonomie en matiere d'approvisionnement en&#13;
eau d'irrigation.&#13;

objectif a court terme du Projet Sectoriel Eau. Les couts et les benefices y afferents seront evalues&#13;
et un tarif acceptable pour toutes les parties sera d&amp;termin6 dans le cadre de 1'etude sur la&#13;
reutilisation des eaux usees pr6vue a cet effet.&#13;
Affectation de 1'eau de la nappe de Thiarove a I'activite aericole&#13;
20.    L'eau du centre de captage est tres chargee en fer et requiert un traitement avant d'etre&#13;
distribuee. De plus elle est de plus en plus polluee suite a la pression exercee par les&#13;
agglomerations de Thiaroye et de Pikine. Cette eau est, comme telle, impropre a la consommation&#13;
humaine A cause de sa teneur elevee en nitrates. Elle constitue cependant une reelle plus-value pour&#13;
l'agriculture.&#13;
21.    L'arrivee A la region de Dakar de l'eau de la solution a long terme entrainera certainement&#13;
la suppression des pompages du Thiaroye. Cependant, si les pompages sont arretes, on assistera a&#13;
ne remontee de la nappe qui pourrait atteindre un niveau ruinant les nombreuses maisons&#13;
construites dans les zones de bas-fonds. II est donc indispensable de continuer A deprimer la nappe&#13;
de Thiaroye au profit des maraichers, pour maintenir sa surface phreatique a un niveau inferieur&#13;
aux c6tes les plus basses du terrain naturel.&#13;
22.    La solution du centre de pompage de Thiaroye devrait de s'inspirer de l'expdeience en&#13;
cours avec le centre de captage de Berr thialane. Cette eau pourrait etre transferee A l'utilisation&#13;
agricole. Un volume d'eau potable equivalent sera recupere des maraichers quotataires localises&#13;
dans un rayon qui rendrait l'operation de transfert viable. II suffirait de trouver une superficie&#13;
d'une centaine d'hectares de cultures maralch6res pour resoudre ce probleme.&#13;

Annexe 2 de la Lettre de Politique Sectorielle&#13;
REPUBLIQUE DU SENEGAL&#13;
MINISTERE DE L'ECONOMIE DES FINANCES ET DU PLAN&#13;
PLAN D'ACTIONS SECTEUR EAU: REDUCTIONS DES CONSMOMMATIONS&#13;
D'EAU DES ADMINISTRATIONS PUBLIQUES ET PAIEMENT A BONNE&#13;
DATE DES FACTURES D'EAU&#13;
Depuis quelques annees, l'etat s'est engage dans une politique d'ajustement en cours&#13;
d'execution qui vise particulierement, a retablir les grands equilibres et a assurer la relance&#13;
de l'economie. La reussite d'une telle politique passe necessairement par la reduction des&#13;
gaspillages de tout genre et surtout par la maitrise des couts des facteurs de production.&#13;
A cet effet, le present plan d'action a pour objectif essentiel d'identifier les mesures a mettre&#13;
en oeuvre pour reduire les consommations d'eau de l'etat et permettre de ce fait, une&#13;
meilleure allocation des ressources au secteur productif. Les pertes d'eau au niveau des&#13;
services publics sont dues essentiellement a:&#13;
Niveau technique: (i) l1'tat des branchements, (ii) l'etat des compteur, (iii)&#13;
1'etat tres obsolete des reseaux, (iv) l'etat de l'appareillage sanitaire et de la&#13;
robinetterie;&#13;
Niveau institutionnel (i) nianque de sensibilisation des utilisateurs, (ii)&#13;
gratuite de l'eau non contr6l6e pour certains agents de I'etat, (iii) absence&#13;
de personnes responsabilisees pour le maintien ou la surveillance des&#13;
reseaux;&#13;
Niveau service rendu par la SONEES actuelle.&#13;
En plus de quelques points lies aux aspects techniques, la SONEES est responsable des autres&#13;
points suivants: (i) les fichiers abonnes qui ne sont pas mis a jour, (ii) la releve des&#13;
compteurs n'est pas reguliere dans certains cas.&#13;
Le plan d' action comprend essentiellement des mesures d' ordre institutionnel et&#13;
organisationnel et des mesures d'ordre technique. Cette r6flexion n'est pas nouvelle et a fait&#13;
l'objet de plusieurs etudes dont celle de Barry-SAFEGE qui est la plus recente et qui date de&#13;
1991.&#13;
Si certaines constatations techniques telles que celles sur les r6seaux, les compteurs et les&#13;
appareillages faites en 1991 ne sont plus d'actualite, les reconunandations y afferentes restent&#13;
valables. En effet, ces aspects cites ci-dessus ont connu un niveau de degradation plus pousse&#13;
du fait du manque d'entretien et de la non application des recommandations issues du rapport&#13;
Barry-SAFEGE. Compte tenu de ces considerations, les recommandations de Barry-SAFEGE&#13;
ont ete toutes reconduites y compris la privatisation des bornes-fontaines publiques.&#13;
I. Mesures d'ordre institutionnel et organisationnel&#13;
I.1. GENERALITES&#13;
Le contr6le des consommations d'eau de I'Etat, le suivi des facturations et des reglements, et&#13;
la definition des modalites d'une reduction des impayes de l'Etat ne peuvent etre mis en&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

oeuvre de maniere efficace, que dans le cadre d'une structure permanente de concertation&#13;
entre I'Etat et la SdE. Des procedures particulieres seront mises en place et une structure&#13;
unique de l'Etat designee pour le traitement des relations avec la SdE.&#13;
Les reamenagements a apporter dans les relations Etat-SdE concerneront, d'amont en aval,&#13;
les procedures suivantes gui seront precisees dans le contrat d'afferrnage:&#13;
-      ream6nagement des relations "Etat-SdE (Societe d'Exploitation)&#13;
-      prise d'abonnements, mise a jour de l'etat des prises administratives&#13;
-      elaboration des budgets des services de I'Etat et responsabilisation des&#13;
gestionnaires;&#13;
-      mesures d'ordre technique liees A la maintenance des r6seaux, a la&#13;
reduction des fuites et au changement des compteurs et branchements par la&#13;
SdE.&#13;
I.2. Mesures prealables: mise en place d'une structure unique de l'Etat chargee du suivi&#13;
des relations avec la SdE&#13;
Le nombre et la dispersion des services de 1'Etat qui seront en relation directe avec la SdE&#13;
pourraient poser en pratique de nombreux problemes de suivi et de contr6le, tant a l'Etat qu'a&#13;
la SdE. Les inter-relations "Etat-SdE" seront plus souples et le contr6le de l'Etat facilite, si&#13;
la SdE n'a en face d'elle qu'une seule structure chargee du suivi du fichier des prises&#13;
administratives et du contr6le des consonmnations en eau des services de l'Etat. Cette&#13;
structure sera log6e au sein de la Direction Generale du Patrimoine Bati (DGPB).&#13;
RWam6naeement des relations de l'Etat et la societ d'Exploitation "Etat-SdE"&#13;
La structure de 1'Etat chargee des relations avec la SdE aura pour taches essentielles&#13;
-      la tenue et la mise a jour du fichier des abonnes administratifs de la SdE et&#13;
sa mise en concordance permanente avec le fichier de la SdE;&#13;
-      le suivi des "Budgets/Consommations Eau" des services de l'Etat et la prise&#13;
de mesures conservatoires avec les services concernes ou la SdE. Lorsque&#13;
les consommations atteignent des niveaux excessifs par rapport aux&#13;
montants budgetises, ces mesures pourraient etre les suivantes: (i)&#13;
demandes adressees aux responsables des services concern6s pour&#13;
l'identification rapide des causes de ces sur-consommations, (ii) demandes&#13;
d'intervention adressees aux services de la SdE pour l 'identification des&#13;
problemes qui se posent au niveau de ces services et I'etablissement d'un&#13;
rapport succinct proposant les solutions A court terme.&#13;
Cette gestion en "pool" des problemes (Services Consonumateurs - Structure Unique de l'Etat&#13;
- SdE) permettra d'introduire une dynamique dans les relations entre I'Etat et la SdE et de&#13;
reduire, si les procedures sont correctement appliquees, de part et d'autre, les consommations&#13;
des services de 1'Etat, de maniere significative.&#13;
I.3 Souscription des abonnements, mise a jour des prises administratives&#13;
L'Etat disposera d'un fichier des prises administratives facturees par la SdE et proceder A sa&#13;
mise a jour reguliere au fur et a mesure de l'acquisition de nouveaux locaux administratifs&#13;
(ou de la liberation d'anciens locaux). A ces rims:&#13;
-      il sera indique a la SdE, le niveau hierarchique du responsable habilite a&#13;
souscrire des abonnements au nom de l'Etat;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
119                                   Annex 8&#13;
Page 15 of 19&#13;
-      chaque nouveau abonnement sera communique par les services de la SdE a&#13;
la structure ci-dessus designee, pour mise a jour du fichier des abonnes&#13;
adminiistratifs tous les mouvements (occupation par I'Etat de nouveaux&#13;
locaux ou liberation d'anciens locaux) seront signales a la structure de&#13;
l'Etat ci-dessus designee, aux fins de mise a jour du fichier des abonnes&#13;
administratifs. Periodiquement (chaque annee), la structure conmmuniquera&#13;
aux services de la SdE une liste mise a jour des prises qu'elle admet comme&#13;
etant des prises admninistratives.&#13;
Dans cet ordre d'idee, il appartient a la SdE en rapport avec la structure de suivi d'apporter&#13;
une solution technique (notanunent, par la mise en place de compteurs divisionnaires) au&#13;
probleme pose par les logements occupes de maniere mixte par des agents de 1'Administration&#13;
et par des particuliers, de maniere a ne pas faire supporter la totalite de la facturation a l'Etat.&#13;
Ceci sera pr6cise dans le contrat d'affermage.&#13;
1.4. Elaboration des budgets, responsabilisation des gestionnaires&#13;
Une nouvelle philosophie sera adoptee pour la confection des budget de consommation d'eau&#13;
des services de 1'Etat et au contr6le des consommations effectives.&#13;
a)    les budgets ne peuvent continuer a etre etablis avec la seule preoccupation&#13;
des restrictions budgetaires a instaurer a tout prix, sans prise en compte des&#13;
consonumations des services fixees a un niveau raisonnable.&#13;
b)     La SdE etablira les previsions de consommation d'eau de l'annee a venir&#13;
pour chaque administration publique, au plus tard 3 mois avant la fin de&#13;
l'annee. Le Gouvernement etablira son budget sur la base de ces&#13;
previsions. Toutefois, en attendant la remise en etat des r6seaux interieures&#13;
des services administratifs programmee dans la premiere annee du Projet&#13;
sectoriel, les budgets de 1996 et 1997 seront etablis sur la base&#13;
d'estimations de consommations normales a determiner avec la SdE.&#13;
c)    les services de I'Etat ne peuvent continuer a faire supporter a celui-ci des&#13;
niveaux de consommations excessifs, sans engagement de leurs&#13;
responsabilites.&#13;
Les procedures a ce niveau seront reamenagees de la maniere suivante&#13;
-      etablissement des budgets des services de l'Etat concemes par concertation&#13;
entre la SdE et la structure designee a cet effet sur la base, non pas des&#13;
consommations anterieures qui comportent une bonne part de "fuites dans&#13;
le reseau" mais de consommations fixees a un nombre de cubage normal, a&#13;
determiner en collaboration avec la SdE;&#13;
-      responsabilisation des gestionnaires concernes sur le respect des budgets&#13;
ainsi elabores: a ce niveau, il est claire que les responsables des services&#13;
concem6s doivent se sentir personnellement concernms par les sur-&#13;
consommations d'eau de leurs services.&#13;
1.5. Mise en place de mesures de maintenance des reseaux, de reduction des fuites et de&#13;
changements des compteurs par la SdE&#13;
Les mesures techniques propres a assurer une reduction des consommations d'eau de l'Etat&#13;
sont explicitees au paragraphe 11. 1 du present rapport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
120                                       Page 16 of 19&#13;
En ce qui concerne plus specifiquement les compteurs inaccessibles, cass6s ou bloques qui&#13;
donnent lieu a une facturation estimee ( pouvant etre, dans certains cas, superieure a la&#13;
facturation normale), il appartient a la SdE, de prendre toutes les dispositions pour permettre&#13;
leur accessibilite ou leur changement.&#13;
La structure a creer selectionnera des entreprises de petite taille chargees des r6parations sur&#13;
les reseaux administratifs. A cet effet, il sera inscrit au budget, un article pour la refection&#13;
des reseaux d'eau des administrations.&#13;
1.6. Amelioration par la SdE du service rendu par I'ancienne SONEES&#13;
L'amelioration par la SdE du service assure par la SONEES est necessaire au niveau&#13;
de la mise a jour des fichiers et de la gestion des compteurs et des branchements.&#13;
Creation d'une cellule de suivi des gros consommateurs au sein de la SdE&#13;
La SONEES avait cree, pour pallier les difficultes rencontrees, une cellule de suivi des gros&#13;
consommateurs. il importe que cette cellule soit dynarnisee et dotee des moyens necessaires&#13;
par la SdE. Les gros consomnuateurs sont: les Ministeres de la Sante, de la Justice, de&#13;
I'Interieur, de I'Education Nationale, des Forces Armees etc... Son programme de travail doit&#13;
etre defini de fagon precise en tenant compte des conclusions des audits effectues en 1989 et&#13;
1991 notamment:&#13;
-      suivi des releves et des consommations des gros consornmateurs&#13;
-      remise en etat des regards et dispositifs de mesures&#13;
-      verification des gros compteurs in situ;&#13;
-      assistance aux abonnes;&#13;
-      tenue de dossiers techniques sur les gros consommateurs administratifs&#13;
-      verification de la mise a jour des fichiers;&#13;
-      etablissement de devis a la demande des gros consommateurs pour&#13;
intervention sur leurs installations interieures (avec concours eventuel du&#13;
bureau d'etudes SdE).&#13;
1.7. Reduction de depenses de I'Admirnistration par transfert de charge aux ayants-droits&#13;
L' Administration doit dans la mesure du possible transferer certaines de ses charges de&#13;
consommation d'eau aux beneficiaires. Ce probleme se pose au niveau des agents dont elle&#13;
accepte de prendre en charge la consommation. II s'agit du probleme des "ayants-droits" a la&#13;
gratuite, habitant le plus souvent dans les logements de fonction de l'Etat et dont la&#13;
consommation d'eau est prise en charge par l'Etat. Le probleme pose est celui du bien fonde&#13;
du droit a la gratuite qui souvent se transmet d'office d'un occupant a un autre. L' Etat&#13;
prendra les dispositions necessaires pour que les personnes visees paient leurs consommations&#13;
d'eau.&#13;
II. Mesures d'ordre technique&#13;
11.1. Evaluation et reparation des fuites sur les reseaux interieurs&#13;
Le premier stade est de reduire le gaspillage et les fuites sur les appareils d'utilisation&#13;
(robinetterie, toilettes, etc.) ce qui permettra une evaluation correcte des fuites invisibles sur&#13;
les reseaux proprement dits et d'apprecier la nature des travaux a effectuer. Le deuxieme&#13;
stade sera la remise en etat des reseaux interieurs apres etude diagnostic et etablissement d'un&#13;
devis par des entreprises specialisees. II faut signaler que la plupart des fuites sont dues a une&#13;
corrosion importante des reseaux galvanises anciens; la corrosion est a la fois interne et&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
121                               Annex 8&#13;
Page 17 of 19&#13;
externe. Il faudra egalement prevoir le renouvellement, des reseaux galvanises anciens et leur&#13;
remplacement par des conduites en PVC ou en polyethylene.&#13;
Selon une etude realisee en 1991, les pertes par fuites et par gaspillage etaient estimees A&#13;
47,2% de la quantit6 totale d'eau facturee A I'administration Independamment de leur impact&#13;
financier pour l'administration, ces pertes apres compteurs ont aussi un impact technique&#13;
important. Ramen6es a 1'ensemble des consomnmations administratives, elles pourraient&#13;
representer jusqu'A 15.000m3/j sur Dakar. Si l'on pouvait reduire ces pertes de 70% par les&#13;
mesures visees dans le present plan d'action, on disposerait ainsi sur Dakar de 1O.OOOm3/j&#13;
supplementaires qui pourraient etre vendus aux autres consommateurs. Ceci viendrait&#13;
s'ajouter des la 1lre phase A la production supplementaire attendue du projet sectoriel eau.&#13;
La SdE devra proceder des sa creation au renouvellement de tous les branchements et&#13;
compteurs defectueux des abonnes administratifs. Elle dotera tous les compteurs des&#13;
administrations d'un regard special muni d'un systeme de fermeture A clef. La clef serait&#13;
detenue au Service concerne par une personne designee par le SAGE ou la DAGE du&#13;
departement. Ladite personne detiendra une fiche de contr6le etablie par la SdE et qui sera&#13;
remplie en sa presence par le releveur apres verification contradictoire de l'index du&#13;
compteur. Ce systeme A I'avantage de faciliter la certification des factures SdE recues par la&#13;
structure centrale creee a la DAGE du Ministere de l'Economie des Finances et du Plan.&#13;
Il est important de noter qu'une premiere estimation du couit des travaux d'urgence a realiser&#13;
a 6te effectuee dans l'etude diagnostic menee par BETURE-SETAME pour la SONEES en&#13;
1989 chez 17 gros abonnes administratifs. Compte tenu de l'importance du volume&#13;
economisable, la conclusion de cette etude est que les investissements recommandes sont&#13;
amortis en moyenne en 39 jours, ce qui constitue un temps de retour particulierement&#13;
attractif. A cet egard une composante de US$ 400 000 est prevu dans la premiere phase du&#13;
Projet Sectoriel Eau, pour le diagnostic et la rehabilitation des reseaux d'eau des&#13;
Administrations. Cette op6ration sera realisee par la SONES (a inclure au contrat-plan).&#13;

PAIEMENT A BONNE DATE DES FACTURES&#13;
D'EAU DES ADMINISTRATIONS PUBLIQUES&#13;
(Annexe 2b)&#13;
L'objectif du Gouvernement est un assainissement adequat de ses relations financieres avec&#13;
les societes nationales de facon generale et particulierement celles avec la SONEES ou la&#13;
future societe d'exploitation (SdE). Pour cela il faut trouver les procedures appropriees pour&#13;
un reglement a bonne date de leurs dettes reciproques par des moyens orthodoxes.&#13;
Le plan d'action visant la reduction des consommations d'eau des administrations publiques&#13;
elabore est un des elements dont I' application urgente est indispensable pour la reussite des&#13;
mesures visees ci dessous. En effet, ce plan permettra de ramener les consommations d'eau&#13;
des administrations publiques au niveau des possibilites budgetaires de I'Etat. Le deuxieme&#13;
element est que, I'Etat traite les societes nationales et la future SdE, comnme tous les autres&#13;
debiteurs du Tresor en leur appliquant une politique de recouvrement rigoureuse.&#13;
Les procedures qui sont listees ci-dessous sont une suite consequente de I'application de&#13;
toutes les mesures visees dans le plan d'action pour la reduction des consommations des&#13;
administrations publiques.&#13;
Les procedures peuvent etre resumees comme suit&#13;
*      Etablir des previsions budgetaires  (MEFP) qui prennent en compte les&#13;

            Senegal - Water Sector Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objectives of the Water
            Sector Project are to address: 1) sustainability, by
            improving management, pricing, and cost recovery and
            reducing the Government subsidy for industrial, domestic,
            and irrigation water; 2) poverty alleviation and health, by
            increasing access to safe potable water and adequate and
            more affordable sanitation for the urban poor; 3) private
            sector participation, by engaging a private company to
            manage urban water supply. The specific implementation
            objectives are: 1) in water resource management - to
            formulate an integrated, multisectoral strategy for the
            shared use of water by households, industry, and agriculture
            that will be coordinated with future development projects in
            these sectors; 2) in institutional capacity building - to
            strengthen the capacity of Management and Planning Unit for
            Water Resources to monitor aquifer exploitation, that of the
            newly established National Water Company of Senegal to
            formulate and enforce policy and strategy, and that of the
            National Office of Urban Sanitation to develop a strategy
            for urban and peri-urban sanitation improvement; 3) in urban
            water production and distribution - to reduce leakages in
            the Greater Dakar water distribution system and to increase
            the region's water production capacity; and 4) in urban
            sanitation - to increase the effectiveness of the existing
            Dakar sewerage system, develop sanitation in secondary
            towns, and promote the reuse of treated municipal wastewater
            for irrigation.
