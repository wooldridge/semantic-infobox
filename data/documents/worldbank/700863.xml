ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper presents estimates of housing demand equation parameters&#13;
separately for owners and renters in Bogota and Cali, Colombia in 1978, and&#13;
for Bogota renters only in 1972. The demand estimation procedure uses a work&#13;
place based stratification to introduce price variation in the equations.&#13;
The demand equations estimated using this procedure give very&#13;
significant results for the income elasticity of the demand for housing, with&#13;
estimates of the income elasticity generally lying in the upper end of the&#13;
rang 0.2 to 0.8, although the price term in the demand appears to be less than&#13;
one. Other household characteristics involved in the demand equations have&#13;
low demand elasticities, typically less than 0.5 in absolute magnitude. The&#13;
age of the head has a positive elasticity over most of its range while family&#13;
size usually has a positive elasticity for renters and a negative elasticity&#13;
for owners. The demand equations suggest that female headed households&#13;
consume more housing than male headed households, but this result is rarely&#13;
statistically significant. Distance from home to work is entered into the&#13;
demand equations as an adjustment to income, but it is undoubtedly also&#13;
representing price variation within the workplace strata that are used as the&#13;
main representation of price variation. The distance elasticity is small,&#13;
less than -0.2, and is almost always negative.&#13;
Comparisons of elasticity estimates with those obtained from U.S.&#13;
data sets indicate that the range of the Colombian estimates generally&#13;
overlaps the range of the U.S. estimates. Simple experiments involving the&#13;
aggregation of the houshold survey data used to obtain micro data estimates&#13;
suggest that income elasticity estimates based on correctly aggregated data&#13;
can be good proxies for estimates based on fully specified models using&#13;
household observations. At the same time, estimates based on micro data that&#13;
are incorrectly aggregated can producs- estimates of the income elasticity of&#13;
demand that are badly biased.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
En este documento se presentan estimaciones sobre parAmetros de la ecua-&#13;
ci6n de la demanda de vivienda en forma separada para propietarios y para&#13;
inquilinos en Bogota y Cali, Colombia, en 1978 y para inquilinos uInicamente en&#13;
Bogota, en 1972.  En el procedimiento de estimaci6n de la demanda se usa una&#13;
estratificaci6n basada en el lugar de trabajo a fin de tomar en cuenta el&#13;
efecto de las diferencias de precio en las ecuaciones.&#13;
Las ecuaciones estimadas con este m6todo presentan resultados muy signi-&#13;
ficativos con respecto a la elasticidad de la demanda de vivienda en funci6n&#13;
del ingreso, la que en general se situa en el extremo superior de la escala de&#13;
0,2 a 0,8, aunque el elemento del precio parece ser inferior a la unidad. Las&#13;
demas caracteristicas de las unidades familiares que intervienen en las ecua-&#13;
ciones de la demanda tienen elasticidades bajas de demanda, generalmente infe-&#13;
riores a 0,5 en terminos absolutos. La edad del jefe de la familia tiene una&#13;
elasticidad positiva en la mayor parte de su gama, en tanto que el tamanio de&#13;
la familia suele tener una elasticidad positiva en lo que respecta a los&#13;
inquilinos y negativa en lo que respecta a los propietarios. Las ecuaciones&#13;
de la demanda indican que los hogares cuyo jefe es una mujer consumen mas&#13;
vivienda que aquellos encabezados por un hombre, pero este resultado rara vez&#13;
es estadisticamente importante. La distancia de la vivienda al lugar de tra-&#13;
bajo se introduce en la ecuaci6n como un ajuste al nivel del ingreso, pero sin&#13;
duda representa tambien una variaci6n del precio dentro de los estratos del&#13;
lugar de trabajo que se emplean como la representaci6n principal de la varia-&#13;
ci6n de precios. La elasticidad de la distancia es pequenia, inferior a -0,2,&#13;
y casi siempre es negativa.&#13;
La comparaci6n de estas estimaciones de la elasticidad con las obtenidas&#13;
de series de datos estadounidenses indica que la gama de estimaciones colom-&#13;
bianas es en general semejante a la gama de las estadounidenses. Experimentos&#13;
sencillos que involucran la agregacion de los datos de encuestas de hogares&#13;
utilizadas a fin de obtener estimaciones de datos al nivel de la unidad fami-&#13;
liar indican que las estimaciones de la elasticidad-ingreso basadas en datos&#13;
agregados correctamente pueden ser buenos sustitutivos de los calculos basados&#13;
en modelos totalmente especificados usando observaciones directas de los hoga-&#13;
res. Al mismo tiempo, las estimaciones basadas en datos al nivel de la unidad&#13;
familiar agregados incorrectamente pueden producir estimaciones de la elasti-&#13;
cidad-ingreso de la demanda sumamente sesgadas.&#13;

Ce document presente une estimation des parametres des 6quations&#13;
de la demande de logement pour les proprietaires et les locataires de&#13;
Bogota et de Cali (Colombie) eni 1978 et pour les locataires de Bogota&#13;
seulement en 1972. Pour etablir les estimations de la demande, on a&#13;
utiiise une stratification fondee sur le lieu de travail pour introduire&#13;
les variations de prix dans les equations.&#13;
Les equations de la demande etablies grace a cette methode&#13;
donnent des resultats tres significatifs sur l'elasticite-revenu de la&#13;
demande de logement, !es estimations de 1'elasticite-revenu se situant&#13;
generalement dans l'extremite superieure de la fourchette 0,2 a 0,8, bien&#13;
que l'element prix de la demande semble etre inferieur a un. Pour les&#13;
autres caracteristiques des menages dont on a tenu compte dans les&#13;
equations de la demande, 1'elasticite de la demande est faible,&#13;
g6n6lalement inferieure a 0,5 en valeur absolue. L'elasticite en fonction&#13;
de l'age du chef de famille est positive pour la plus grande partie des&#13;
tranches d'age considerees, alors que l'elasticite en fonction de la&#13;
taille de la famille est generalement positive pour les locataires et&#13;
n6gative pour les proprietaires. Il ressort des equations de la demande&#13;
que le' menages diriges par des femmes ont une plus forte consommation de&#13;
logements que les m6nages diriges par des hommes, mais ce resultat est&#13;
rarement significatif sur le plan statistique.  La distance du domicile au&#13;
lieu de travail est prise en compte grice a un ajustement du revenu, mais&#13;
il est evident qutelle represente egalement des variacions de prix dans&#13;
les strates etablies en fonction du lieu de travail, qui sont le principal&#13;
moyen de repr6sentation des variations de prix.  L'elasticite en fonction&#13;
de la distance est faible, moins de -0,2, et elle est presque toujours&#13;
negative.&#13;
Si l'on compare ces estimations de l'elasticit6 a celles que&#13;
l'on obtient a partir de series de donn6es pour les Etats-Unis, on&#13;
constate que, dans ltensemble, ces estimations se recouvrent. Il ressort&#13;
d'exp6riences simples comportant l'agregation des donnees provenant&#13;
d'enqu6tes sur les m6nages utilisees pour obtenir des micro-donnees que&#13;
les estimations de l'lasticite-revenu etablies d'apres des donnees&#13;
correctement agregees peuvent etre un bon substitut aux estimations&#13;
etblies d'apres des modeles complets et d'observations sur les menages.&#13;
Mais des estimations de l1'lasticit6-revenu de la demande tirees de&#13;
micro-donnees mal agreg6es peuvent etre fortement biaisees.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
This paper forms part of a large program of research grouped under&#13;
the rubric of the "City Study" of Bogota, Colombia, being conducted at the&#13;
World Bank in collaboration with Corporacion Centro Regional de Poblacion.&#13;
The goal of the City Study is to increase our understanding of the workings of&#13;
five major urban sectors -- housing, transport, employment location, labor&#13;
markets, and the public sector -- in order that the impact of policies and&#13;
projects can be assessed more accurately.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
This paper reports three sets of results related to the&#13;
estimation of housing demand equations. First, it presents estimates&#13;
of housing demand parameters based on household interview data from&#13;
Bogota and Cali, Colombia. A comparison of parameter values to those&#13;
obtained from North American data sets shows that the Colombia demand&#13;
elasticities are generally comparable in magnitude to those from the&#13;
United States. Second, the approach employed to represent housing&#13;
price variation in the demand equations uses a theoretically attractive&#13;
and computationally straight forward procedure that is based on&#13;
residential location theory. Finally, a simple exercise illustrates the&#13;
magnitude of bias of the income elasticity of demand that can result&#13;
from incorrect data aggregation techniques. Moreover, correctly aggregated&#13;
data produce' income elasticity estimates that are similar to those&#13;
obtained from disaggregate or micro data.&#13;
II. THE PRICE TERM IN HOUSING DEMAND EQUATIONS&#13;
Estimating demand equations for housing from cross sectional&#13;
data presents many challenges, but measuring the variation in the unit&#13;
price of housing is probably one of the greatest difficulties. Data&#13;
sets typically report the total expenditure on housing rather than a&#13;
-unit price and quantity of housing. Hence the unit price must be inferred&#13;
by relating variations in expenditure to variations in quantity.&#13;
Moreover, housing is inherently multidimensional, including attributes of&#13;
size, dwelling quality, location, public services, and neighborhood&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
amenities that are obtained in a single tied purchase. Since there is&#13;
no widespread agreement as to how we should measure the quantity of&#13;
housing,one analyst's price variation may be another analyst's quantity&#13;
variation. Finally, even if we can agree that housing prices may vary,&#13;
it is not obvious that all price variation is relevant for inclusion in&#13;
a housing demand equation.  For example, if a metropolitan area's&#13;
housing prices vary with the quantity of housing but households can&#13;
locate anywhere, we cannot simply put the price actually paid by the&#13;
household into the demand equation because the household faces the&#13;
whole schedule of prices. Simple inclusion of price indices in a demnnd&#13;
aquation requires that households be in different market segments.&#13;
Numerous approaches have been employed to deal with one or&#13;
more of these difficulties. Some examples include:&#13;
(i) Assume intra-metropolitan price variation does not exist&#13;
so that all variation in expenditures reflects variations&#13;
in quantities; use expenditures in demand analysis as an&#13;
index number to measure quantities. (Muth).&#13;
(ii) Allow intra-metropolitan prices to vary across neigh-&#13;
borhoods; estimate neighborhood based price indices;&#13;
then estimate demand equations assuming that residents&#13;
of each neighborhood face only the prices in their own&#13;
neighborhood. (King)&#13;
(iii) Allow intra-metropolitan prices to vary by individual&#13;
dwelling units; estimate a dwelling unit price index&#13;
using a production function for housing and varying input&#13;
prices; estimate demand equations assuming that occupants&#13;
of each dwelling unit face only the price of their own&#13;
dwelling unit. (Polinsky and Elwood)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
(iv)    Allow the marginal cost of attributes to differ within a&#13;
metropolitan area; estimate a non-linear hedonic price index and&#13;
use the first derivative of the index with respect to specific&#13;
attributes as the price term in a demand equation for the&#13;
attribute. (Witte, et al)&#13;
Each of these approaches has potential shortcomings.    Omitting&#13;
price variation, as in (i), can bias other demand equation parameters if the&#13;
omitted price term is correlated with included variables. Assuming that&#13;
households face only their neighborhood or dwelling unit prices, as in (ii)&#13;
and (iii), may fundamentally mis-state the price variation in the sample if&#13;
households are not limited in their choices to specific neighborhoods or&#13;
dwelling units. If all purchasers face all prices, the price "chosen" may&#13;
reflect the impact of other household characteristics. Neighborhood-based or&#13;
dwelling unit-based price variation requires a justification for market&#13;
segmentation based on those dimensions. Estimating demand equations for&#13;
specific attributes of housing, as in (iv), may not be relevant if we are&#13;
really interested in the demand for housing as a composite good.&#13;
A relatively simple application of residential location theory&#13;
suggests an alternative way of incorporating price variation into a demand&#13;
equation for housing as a composite good. Simple models of residential&#13;
location theory are essentially based on the precepts of cost minimization. A&#13;
worker surveys the housing market from his workplace, J, and he typically&#13;
observes that housing prices , R, decline with distance, d, from his workplace&#13;
in at least one direction. However, travel costs, t, increase with distance&#13;
from his workplace.  For any given amount of housing, H, he faces a total&#13;
expenditure on housing, Z, composed of a housing expenditure plus a transport&#13;
expenditure,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
Z.  -  Rj(d).H + t.(d).                        (1)&#13;
For quantity E the worker can solve for the least cost distance by&#13;
taking derivatives&#13;
I      I             I&#13;
Z.      R R.d) (.Ho + t. (d) - 0               (2)&#13;
and solving the expression for d;, the optimal distance or location&#13;
for quantity H0 and workplace j. This least cost distance can be&#13;
substituted back into equation 1 to calculate the minimum total&#13;
expenditure for quantity H0, as&#13;
Z.  -  R.(d. ).H  + t   d                      (3)&#13;
Consider carrying out this exercise for different work-&#13;
places in a metropolitan area. The decline of housing prices with&#13;
distance, R. (d), will differ systematically across workplaces, very&#13;
likely showing steep rates of decline with distance for centrally&#13;
located workplaces and gradual rates of decline for peripheral work-&#13;
places.   Travel costs per unit distance may also differ by workplace&#13;
but in ways that may be difficult to generalize. For example, transit&#13;
speeds may be higher but transit headways longer at peripheral locations&#13;
as compared to central locations. As the workplace varies, however,&#13;
there will be variation in the optimal housing and travel expenditure&#13;
required for housing quantity H . This variation in expense by workplace&#13;
0&#13;
for a given quantity of housing will be used as a measure of price&#13;
variation in the housing demand equations estimated here. A price index&#13;
will be estimated for each workplace zone. Households whose heads work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
at a particular workplace zone will face the same housing price index.&#13;
Households with heads at another workplace will face the price index at their&#13;
workplace, and so forth. Price.variation will be across workplaces.&#13;
If housing prices vary by workplace, it is worth asking why all&#13;
workers do not try to obtain jobs at the workplace that has the lowest housing&#13;
price index. Urban economists have long argued that a metropolitan area with&#13;
multiple workplaces and a price gradient for housing will have to have&#13;
differential wage levels across workplaces for households to be in equilibrium&#13;
(Moses). The existence of wage gradients across workplaces thus becomes a&#13;
necessary condition for the workplace based housing price variation approach&#13;
taken here.*/&#13;
III. HOUSING DEMAND AND WORK PLACE-BASED PRICE VARIATION&#13;
In developing a workplace based price index for housing, two possible&#13;
definitions of the price of housing can be used. Different definitions will&#13;
alter the specification of the demand equations that we estimate. In one&#13;
formulation the price of housing will be based only on the housing expenditure&#13;
and will not include the travel expenditure. In this case the budget&#13;
constraint will be written&#13;
Y  =  PH H + Pv V + t(d)            (4)&#13;
*/Preliminary empirical work indicates that a wage gradient with a peak in&#13;
the Central Business District does exist in Bogota.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
where Y is income; PH, the price of housing; and Pv, the price of a&#13;
composite commodity V. In this formulation, the travel expenditure,&#13;
t (d), is included in the income constraint, and the derived demand&#13;
equation will be of the form&#13;
H  - f [PH, O-t [dl                            (5&#13;
That is, travel costs will have to be subtracted from income in the&#13;
demand equation. If travel costs are an unknown function of distance,&#13;
d, then   d will be included in the demand equation as a separate&#13;
variable.&#13;
In the second possible formulation the price of housing will&#13;
be the so-called gross price and will be based on the housing expenditure&#13;
plus the travel expenditure. In this case the budget constraint will&#13;
be written.&#13;
y  -  ZH H. + Pv. V,                           (6)&#13;
where ZH is the gross price term. In this case the travel cost does&#13;
not enter separately into the budget constraint and the distance term&#13;
will not appear in the demand equations. However, to implement this&#13;
second approach one must be able to specify a priori the travel cost&#13;
function which will be a combination of out of pocket cost and the&#13;
opportunity cost of travel time. Since not enough information is avail-&#13;
able for Bogota and Cali to allow us to specify the travel cost function&#13;
with confidence, the first approach has been implemented here. Therefore,&#13;
the estimated demand equations will have distance to the workplace in&#13;
them as in Equation 5, and the workplace based price term will be based&#13;
on housing expenditure only.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The relevant housing expenditure that will be used to define a&#13;
price index for a given workplace will be the "efficient" or optimal&#13;
expenditure implicit in the solution of equations 2 and 3 above.&#13;
Corresponding to each quantity of housing, H, will be an optimal location&#13;
or optimal distance, d, and an optimal expenditure, R Cd ).H.&#13;
If households are employing the kind of locational calculus embodied in&#13;
residential location theory, the choices made by households with a&#13;
head employed at a particular workplace will be at or near the optimal&#13;
location for that workplace, and their housing expenditure will ap-&#13;
proximate the optimal expenditure for their workplace and housing&#13;
quantity.   The relation between housing expenditures and housing&#13;
quantity for a given workplace can be captured by regressing the observed&#13;
housing expenditure on measures of housing quantity for households whose&#13;
heads work at the same work zone. The relation between housing expenditure&#13;
and housing quantity can then be used to formulate a price index for&#13;
the given workplace. This procedure can be repeated for each workplace&#13;
so that price indices can be calculated for each workplace. These work-&#13;
place-specific price indices then can be used as a price term in demand&#13;
equations for housing as a composite good.&#13;
The specific procedure that has been implemented in this paper&#13;
can be summarized as follows. We have a sample of M households whose&#13;
.household heads have jobs located at one of J workzones, and there are N.&#13;
*1 Equation 3 can be solved for the expansion path of expenditures&#13;
as the quantity of housing increases,as shown in Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
households associated with workplace j. We know for household i (i - 1 to N )&#13;
at workplace j the monthly expenditure on housing (or the dwelling unit&#13;
value), R.j, and a set of K dwelling unit characteristics, Xij.  For&#13;
each of the J workzones we estimate the equation&#13;
K&#13;
.j- E       B.   .X..                         7&#13;
k .     ik      ijk&#13;
by regressing housing expenditure on the measure of dwelling characteristics,&#13;
and we obtain J sets of parameters which indicate how the cost of housing&#13;
attributes varies by workplace. We then define a representative dwelling&#13;
unit in the housing market as the unit that has the sample wide average&#13;
amount of each dwelling unit characteristic,. where the average quantity&#13;

The dwelling with attributes Xk then becomes the standard unit or the&#13;
equivalent of the standardized market basket for housing. For each&#13;
workplace we use the estimated parameters in equation 7 to calculate&#13;
the cost of the standard unit as&#13;
ij  - jjk  -    '-                             (9)&#13;
This cost of a standardized unit is used to formulate a workplace price&#13;
index by choosing workplace 1 as a numeraire and calculating a price index&#13;

The households in the sample also have C household characteristics,&#13;
RCc, associated with them that affect household demand for housing.&#13;
These characteristics of the households and the distance from home to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
work, di., are used in a demand equation whose dependent variable is&#13;
housing expenditure divided by the price index in equation 10, or a&#13;
quantity index of housing. The demand equation is of the form&#13;
R..&#13;
f (I. , HC.. dj.)                      (11)&#13;
and is, estimated over the sample of all M households as a single pooled&#13;
demand function. ln this paper both linear and double log specifications&#13;
are used for equation 11.&#13;
IV. THE SETTING AND THE DATA&#13;
The household interview data used to implement the housing&#13;
demand procedure just outlined are from Boggta and Cali, Colombia.&#13;
The major data set used was collected in 1978 and covers both owners&#13;
and renters, for whom equations are estimated separately, in both&#13;
Bogota and Cali. A second data set is available for Bogota in 1972&#13;
but data for only renters can be used to estimate the demand for&#13;
housing in 1972.&#13;
In 1978 Bogota had a population of roughly 3.5 million and&#13;
Cali, a population of roughly 1.1 million. Both cities have experienced&#13;
rapid rates of population growth in the past, e.g. Bogota's population&#13;
in 1972 was 2.8 million, but current population growth rates are&#13;
moderating in both cities. Per capita income in 1978 was about $800&#13;
per annum in the two cities. The cities differ significantly in climate&#13;
because of their differences in altitude. Bogota is 8000 feet above&#13;
sea level and has temperate weather with cool nights.  Cali, at 3000 feet&#13;
above sea level, is semi-tropical and warmer than Bogota. Differences&#13;
in size and climate may well explain some of the differences in housing&#13;
demand in the two cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
To implement the workplace-derived price indices it was&#13;
necessary to divide the two cities into a number of workzones. The&#13;
work zones that resulted are arbitrary but are based on considerations&#13;
including compactness, respect for significant internal boundaries,&#13;
and a requirement that there be an adequate number of observations in&#13;
each work zone. The same work zone system was used in Bogota in 1972&#13;
and 1978 and the same work zone system was used for renters and owners&#13;
in each city. Tabulations of residence and workplace by annular ring&#13;
and radial sector indicate a high degree of association between place&#13;
of work of the household head and place of residence of the household.&#13;
Empirical analyses indicate that the workplace of secondary workers may&#13;
have a slight influence on a households' residential location, but the&#13;
workplace of the household head is clearly a dominant determinant of&#13;
residential location (Pineda). Average comute lengths in kilometers&#13;
for each work zone and tenure type are shown in Exhibit 1 for Bogota and&#13;
Exhibit 2 for Cali. In both cities these averages differ by up to a factor&#13;
of 3. In both cities comute lengths are long for centrally located work-&#13;
places and also for workplaces located along the mountains.&#13;
V. THE HEDONIC PRICE EQUATIONS&#13;
Separate hedonic equations were estimated for each work zone&#13;
and tenure type in Bogota and Cali in 1978. For 1972 in Bogota a hedonic&#13;
equation was estimated for renters only because no data were available&#13;
about the value of owner occupied units in thel972 sample. For renters&#13;
the dependent variable is the monthly rent and for owners the dependent&#13;
variable is the value of the dwelling unit in thousands of pesos. The&#13;

1978 data were all collected in the same survey with the same questionaire&#13;
so it is possible to use the same specification for the four sets of&#13;
1978 equations. In the 1978 equations the independent variables used&#13;
included the dwelling unit area in square meters, DUAREA; the lot&#13;
area in a2 , LQTAREA; the number of blocks to the nearest bus line,&#13;
BLKTOBUS; a dummy variable equal to 1 if the residence had a private or&#13;
public}phone, DPHONACSS; a dummy variable equal to 1 if the dwelling unit&#13;
had its own non-shared kitchen and bathroom facilities, DEXCLUSE; and a&#13;
dummy variable equal to 1 if the dwelling unit had its garbage picked&#13;
up by municipal authorities, DGARBCOL. The average values for the&#13;
dependent and independent variables for the 1978 data are shown in&#13;
Exhibits 3 through 6. It is interesting to note the similarities&#13;
and differences between tenure classes and cities in these exhibits.&#13;
Renters in Bogota and Cali, for example, have similar sized units&#13;
on similar sized lots but Bogota renters have more phones while Cali renters&#13;
have better garbage collection. Bogota owners have larger, more&#13;
expensive homes on larger lots than Cali owners.  Between renters and&#13;
owners the most striking differences are in the average area of the unit&#13;
and the proportion of units having exclusive bath and kitchen facilities;&#13;
owners are better housed than renters. Finally, there is more variability&#13;
in the average dependent variable across work zones than there seems to&#13;
be in the average independent variables.&#13;
The independent variables used in the 1972 equations differ&#13;
from those used in 1978 because the questionaire was quite different.&#13;

tripled from 47 in 1972 to 150 in 1978.&#13;
The coefficients from the hedonic price equations are shown in&#13;
Exhibits 8 through 12. Again, the 1978 results are the most comparable.&#13;
In 1978 there are equations for 13 Bogota and 8 Cali work zones and for&#13;
2 tenure types, or a total of 42 equations. The only variable that&#13;
always has the correct sign in all 42 equations is dwelling unit area.&#13;
Access to a phone, exclusive bath and kitchen facilities, and garbage&#13;
collection also perform well, having the expected sign 36, 37, and 32&#13;
times respectively. The number of blocks to a bus is only positive&#13;
half of the time, but it is possible that there is some disamenity&#13;
associated with being too close to the nearest bus route. Lot area&#13;
does not perform well in the hedonic equations, and it does very&#13;
poorly in Cali where owners in particular do not seem to value additional&#13;
lot size. The hedonic equations for the 1972 Bogota renters, shown in&#13;
Exhibit 12, are similar to those for 1978 in that the measure of interior&#13;
space, the number of rooms, has a positive effect on rent.&#13;
A measure of the explanatory power of the hedonic price equations&#13;
is shown in Exhibit 13 which summarizes the explanatory power of the&#13;
regression equations and the workplace stratification in an analysis of&#13;
variance framework. Overall the analysis explains from 45 to 69 percent&#13;

of the variation in housing prices with the equations having much more&#13;
explanatory power than the workplace stratification. Interestingly,&#13;
the workplace stratification has much more explanatory power for owner&#13;
occupied units than for renter occupied units. This is consistent with&#13;
the empirical regularity that owner occupied units have steeper price&#13;
gradients in urban areas than do renter occupied units. Hence, work-&#13;
place location matters more in the owner market than in the renter&#13;
market.&#13;
The "standardized" rents and values obtained by plugging the&#13;
average renter and owaer unit characteristics for Bogota and Cali into&#13;
their respective workplace hedonic equations are shown in the last row&#13;
of Exhibits 3 through 7 above. For-use in the demand equations these&#13;
rents and values are transformed into spatial price indices by dividing&#13;
through by the relevant rent or value for workzone 1, the central&#13;
business district. The resulting normalized price indices are displayed&#13;
for Bogota in Exhibit 14 and for Cali in Exhibit 15. There obviously&#13;
is variation in these price indices across workzones.   In both Bogota&#13;
and Cali there is more variation in the price index for owners (the&#13;
range covers a factor of 2) than for renters.&#13;
VI.  THE HOUSING DEMAND EQUATIONS&#13;
The dependent variable in the demand equations is the monthly&#13;
rent or value divided by the workplace-specific price index as shown&#13;
in equation 11. The independent variables are monthly household income&#13;
(a measure of current income) in pesos, the price index described above,&#13;
and the airline distance from home to work in meters. Three additional&#13;

household characteristics are included in the demand equations: a dummy&#13;
variable for the sex of the household head (1- male); family size&#13;
measured by the number of persons in the household; and the age of the&#13;
household head in years. These three characteristics are hypothesized&#13;
to capture differences in taste  (sex of head), differences in the need&#13;
for housing (family size), and differences in assets or wealth (age of&#13;
the head). Two functional forms are estimated, double log and linear.&#13;
In the linear specifications squaredte=s for family size and the age&#13;
of the head are entered to capture non-linearity in the effects of those&#13;
variables.&#13;
Five sets of equations are estimated for each year, tenure&#13;
choice, and city combination. The ten fully specified equations are&#13;
displayed in column 1 (linear specificationsy and column 3 (log-log&#13;
specification) in the tables in Annex II. Column 5 shows the mean value&#13;
of each variable in the demand equations.   A comparisofn of these mean&#13;
values across the five samples shows that renters have younger heads,&#13;
smaller families, and lower incomes than owners. Differences between&#13;
Bogota and Cali are slight-except for income: Bogota owners have much&#13;
higher average incomes than Cali owners whereas Bogota renters have&#13;
average incomes similar to Cali renters. In comparing Bogota renters&#13;
over time, 1978 Bogota renters had smaller families and younger heads&#13;
than did 1972 Bogota renters.&#13;
The demand equations in Annex II perform well with R  statistics&#13;
ranging from 0.25 to 0.6. Income is by far the most important explanatory&#13;

variable. Age of the head and family size are usually significant&#13;
while sex of the head is usually not significant, although it always&#13;
has a negative sign. The housing price index is significant in two of&#13;
the five samples, and it always has the correct sign. Distance from&#13;
home to work is significant in four of the five samples and has the correct&#13;
sign in 9 of the 10 equations.&#13;
A summary of the fully specified demand equation results are&#13;
displayed in Exhibits 16 and 17 for renters and owners in the form of&#13;
of elasticities f6r each independent variable. These elasticities are&#13;
calculated in the linear equations using the mean value of each independent&#13;
variable except income. The linear elasticities are shown for approximately&#13;
the first, second, and third quartiles of each sample's income distribution.&#13;
In each case, the sample mean and the 75th percentile of the income&#13;
disttibution are essentially identical.&#13;
The magnitude of the various elasticities obviously vary across&#13;
the samples shown, but they also display a consistent and stable pattern&#13;
for most of the variables. All income elasticities are less than one,&#13;
and at the sample mean they lie in a narrow range of 0.6 to 0.8 except&#13;
for the Cali renter equations. The elasticity of the sex of the head&#13;
is always negative and small being absolutely less than -0.2. Family&#13;
size elasticities show an interesting pattern, being negative for owners&#13;
and usually positive for renters. Since renter occupied units are usually&#13;
smaller than owner occupied units, it appears that space is a binding&#13;
constraint for renters, and larger renter families obtain more housing.&#13;
Owner occupants, on the other hand, seem to be able to reduce the quantity&#13;
of housing demanded as family size increases because they have larger units&#13;

on the average, and the quantity of housing is not constrained by family&#13;
size. Age of the household head has a consistently positive demand&#13;
elasticity when evaluated at the sample mean. Using the linear demand&#13;
equation with the squared term for head's age, it is possible to calculate&#13;
the age at which housing demand is a maximum. This is consistently&#13;
within the range 50 to 57 except for Bogota owners, for which it is 112.&#13;
The price elasticity of demand is consistently less than one and becomes&#13;
absolutely quite small for some of the linear specifications. Finally,&#13;
the distance elasticity is almost consistently negative and quite small.&#13;
Exhibit 18 summarizes the range of demand elasticities obtained&#13;
from Cali and Bogota and compares them with estimates obtained from&#13;
household surveysfrom the United States and Korea.   The general pattern&#13;
of results is quite similar between the U.S. and Colombia, with both&#13;
countries differing somewhat from Korea.   The Colombian income elasticities&#13;
are somewhat higher than those obtained in the U.S. while the Colombian&#13;
price elasticities may be lower than those from the U.S. The elasticities&#13;
of housing demand with respect to family size and age of the head&#13;
cannot be compared with numbers from the U.S. but are somewhat similar&#13;
to the Korean estimates. Finally, the effect of the sex of the household&#13;
head, although usually statistically insignificant in Colombia, is also&#13;
always negative as in the U.S. There are three possible explanations&#13;
for this result. First, female headed households may have stronger&#13;
preferences for housing than male headed households. Second, female&#13;
headed households may be discriminated against and face higher prices&#13;

which could produce larger expenditures on housing. Those larger ex-&#13;
penditures could show up as a preference for larger quantities in the&#13;
demand equations for renters, but the discrimination hypothesis is&#13;
unconvincing for owner occupants. Third, female household heads have&#13;
shorter commute distances than male household heads and may therefore&#13;
systematically pay higher prides for housing because they commute less&#13;
far down the rent gradient. The demand equations used should account&#13;
for this, however, because distance is included. Accordingly, the&#13;
first explanation, based on preference differences, may be the most&#13;
plausible.&#13;
In order to investigate the effect of distance on the sex of&#13;
head coefficient, and to see how sensitive the other parameters were&#13;
to both the price and distance terms, the housing demand equations&#13;
were estimated without the price and distance terms. The results&#13;
are shown in columns two and four in the tables in Annex II.&#13;
Examination of these tables indicates that omitting the price and distance&#13;
terms tends to reduce the income coefficient very slightly, often only&#13;
in the third significant digit. The family size effects are also&#13;
minimally affected by the omission of these two terms. The sex of&#13;
head and age of head coefficients do change quite a bit in percentage&#13;
terms, however. This seems to be largely due to the omission of the&#13;
diitance term. Female headed households live closer to the head's&#13;
workplace than do male headed households, as do households with older&#13;
heads as compared to households with younger heads. In general, however,&#13;
the parameter estimates for the included variables are very stable&#13;
with respect to the omission of the price and distance terms.&#13;

These exercises suggest that neither the housing prices as&#13;
specified in these demand equations nor the distance from home to work&#13;
are collinear with household income. Indeed, in Bogota and Cali, as&#13;
in many other cities, the use of micro data dramatically reduces&#13;
problems of multi-collinearity in the estimation of housing demand&#13;
equations.&#13;
VII. AGGREGATE ESTIMATES OF INCOME ELASTICITIES&#13;
All of the parameter estimates that have been presented so&#13;
far have been obtained from computer based multivariate regressions&#13;
using individual households as observations. In many situations it&#13;
may not be possible to gain access to individual household records&#13;
because of confidentiality restrictions while in other situations&#13;
sufficient time or adequate computer facilities may make parameter&#13;
estimation with micro data impossible. In this section we briefly&#13;
investigate the adequacy of parameter estimates that could be estimated&#13;
from published aggregated data. We focus on the estimation of the&#13;
income elasticity of the demand for housing because that parameter&#13;
is often of interest in both the design and evaluation of housing&#13;
programs,policies, and projects.&#13;
Each of the five samples we have analyzed was summarized&#13;
in a matrix dimensioned by rent or value and income. Eight income&#13;
categories were used for the 1978 data and nine for the 1972 data.&#13;
The average rent or value was calculated for each income category;&#13;
this average was then regressed on the mid-points of the income&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
categories in a log-log specification using a hand held calcularor.&#13;
The equations resulting from this exercise are shown in Exhibit 19,&#13;
and the resulting income elasticities are compared to those from&#13;
the disaggregate, fully specified equations in Exhibit 20.   The&#13;
aggregate estimates each differ by less than 20 percent from the&#13;
disaggregate 16g-log estimates, and in 4 out of 5 cases the aggregate&#13;
log-log estimates lie between the linear and log-log disaggregate&#13;
estimates. It is obvious that aggregate based estimates of income&#13;
elasticities of the expenditure for housing could be a very good&#13;
approximation for the income elasticity of demand for housing in&#13;
the samples used here.&#13;
It is important to note, however, that the aggregate estimates&#13;
obtained are very sensitive to the way in which the underlying micro&#13;
data are aggregated. Two experiments illustrating this were performed&#13;
with the 1972 sample of renters. First, the sample was aggregated&#13;
to the level of 63 zones for the city of Bogota,and average rents and&#13;
incomes were calculated for each zone. A hand held calculator was then&#13;
used to calculate a log-log regression of average z6nal rent on average&#13;
zonal income using all 63 observations. The resulting income elasticity,&#13;
0.95, was substantially higher than the 0.71 estimate obtained using&#13;
nine observations from the correctly aggregated sample. A third&#13;
experiment was then run on the 1972 Bogota data. For this experiment&#13;
the data in the rent-income matrix were incorrectly aggregated by&#13;
calculating the average income for each rent category and regressing&#13;
the rent category midpoints on the mean incomes. This rent stratified&#13;
approach yielded an income elasticity estimate of 1.36, nearly twice&#13;

VIII. CONCLUSION&#13;
This paper has described and implemented a two step estimation&#13;
procedure for incorporating price variation in the estimation of demand&#13;
equations for housing using household survey data from Bogota and Cali,&#13;
Colombia. The demand equations estimated using this procedure give&#13;
very significant results for the income elasticity of the demand for&#13;
housing, with estimates of the income elasticity generally lying in&#13;
the upper end of the range 0.2 to 0.8. Although the price term in&#13;
the demand equations gave less significant results, the price elasticity&#13;
of demand appears to be less than one. There is, however, greater&#13;
uncertainty about the magnitude of the price elasticity than about the&#13;
magnitude of the income elasticity. Other household characteristics&#13;
involved in the demand equations have low demand elasticities, typically&#13;
less than 0.5 in absolute magnitude. The age of the head has a positive&#13;
elasticity over most of its range while family-size usually has a positive&#13;
elasticity for renters and a negative elasticity for owners. The demand&#13;
equations suggest that female headed households consume more housing than&#13;
male headed households, but this result is rarely statistically significant.&#13;
Distance from home to work is entered into the demand equations as an&#13;

adjustment to income, but it is undoubtedly also representing price variation&#13;
within the workplace strata that are used as the main representation of&#13;
price variation. The distance elasticity is small, less than -0.2, and&#13;
is almost always negative.&#13;
Comparisons of elasticity estimates with those obtained from&#13;
U.S. data sets indicate that the range of the Colombian estimates generally&#13;
overlaps the range of the U.S. estimates.   This similarity of values&#13;
may seem surprising at first, but is much less so on reflection. Housing&#13;
is a non-traded good and its price is endogenous to the local economy,&#13;
reflecting, among other things, local income levels.  Perhaps we should&#13;
be more surprised at the similarities between Bogota and Cali, two cities&#13;
whose climates differ markedly.&#13;
Simple experiments involving the aggregation of the household&#13;
survey data used to obtain micro data estimates suggest that income&#13;
elasticity estimates based on correctly aggregated data can be good&#13;
proxies for estimates based on fully specified models using household&#13;
observations. At the same time, estimates based on iicro data that are&#13;
incorrectly aggregated can produce estimates of the income elasticity&#13;
of demand that are badly biased.&#13;

ANNEX I. Housing Expenditure and Housing Quantity&#13;
The residential location model used has been formulated in&#13;
the location rent/transport cost trade off mode as a surface of total&#13;
expenditure as&#13;
Z (H, d)  -  R(d).H  +  t (d),                 (Al-1)&#13;
where R(d) is a rent gradient, H is the quantity of housing, t(d) is&#13;
a travel cost function, and d is a measure of distance or location.&#13;
The relevant set of Z(H,d)'s for a household to consider are those where&#13;
for each H, Z(H,d) is a minimum. These minimum points constitute a&#13;
locus of efficient expenditure points for a household on a graph whose&#13;
axes were labelled Z and R. This total expenditure expansion path can&#13;
obviously be disaggregated into an expenditure expansion path for each&#13;
of its two-components, transport and housing. We can solve for the housing&#13;
expenditure expansion path, using general notation, by taking the&#13;
derivative of Equation Al-l.&#13;
Z'  (H,D)  - R' (d).H.+ t'(d) - 0              (Al-2)&#13;
and solving for the optimal location, d*, as&#13;
d*  - g (R', t', R).                           (Al-3)&#13;
This can be substituted back into the housing expenditure expression&#13;
.to form an expansion path of housing expenditures as&#13;
R (d*).H - R [g(RL, t' IH)]  .,                (Al-4)&#13;
which is a function of workplace-specific price gradients  and travel&#13;
costs,as well as the quantity of housing consumed. It is this expenditure&#13;
expansion path that we are trying to sumarize with our workplace-&#13;
specific price index.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Note that one could substitute a housing demand equation for&#13;
E into equation Al-3 and get an expression for d* as a function of&#13;
R', t', and income plus other household characteristics.-/ We have&#13;
not employed this completely reduced from approach because the goal of&#13;
this exercise is the estimation of housing demand equations. Hence,&#13;
we deal only with cost minimization concerns in order to define an&#13;
efficient consumption possibility locus for a household.&#13;
*l I owe this point to Joseph DeSalvo.&#13;

            Housing demand in the developing metropolis
            : estimates from Bogota and Cali, Colombia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper presents estimates of housing
            demand equation parameters separately for owners and renters
            in Bogota and Cali, Colombia in 1978, and for Bogota renters
            only in 1972.  The demand estimation procedure uses a
            workplace based stratification to introduce price variation
            in the equations. The demand equations estimated using this
            procedure give very significant results for the income
            elasticity of the demand for housing.  Other household
            characteristics involved in the demand equations have low
            demand elasticities. The age of household head has a
            positive elasticity over most of its range while family size
            usually has a positive elasticity for renters and a negative
            elasticity for owners.  Female headed households seem to
            consume more than male headed households, but this result is
            rarely statistically significant. Distance from home to work
            is entered into the equations as an adjustment to income,
            but it is undoubtedly also representing price variation
            within the workplace strata that are used as the main
            representation of price variation. The distance elasticity
            is small and almost always negative.  Comparison with US
            data sets indicate that the range of the Colombian estimates
            generally overlaps the range of the US estimates.
