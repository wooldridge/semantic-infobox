&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of 16&#13;
countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systems â&#128;&#147; in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Over the course of the last few years, the water supply and       The greatest challenges are found in rural areas, which are&#13;
sanitation sector in the Central African Republic has seen        severely neglected, particularly in the case of sanitation for&#13;
intense reforms; however, the country is progressing from         which levels of anticipated investment are still very low.&#13;
a very challenging baseline.                                      Implementation or water supply and sanitation interventions&#13;
                                                                  are hampered by very low population density and limited&#13;
Comparison of the historic access trends with set targets         access to parts of the country. Though the political situation&#13;
shows that the current pace of infrastructure development         has stabilized some areas remain insecure.&#13;
is insufficient. To reach these targets, annual investment will&#13;
need to increase nine-fold compared to the sum invested           The urban water supply subsector has gone from one crisis&#13;
in 2008.                                                          situation to the next. The water tariff structure combined&#13;
                                                                  with underfinancing in the subsector has led to financial&#13;
The prospects for this are unlikely: only 44 percent of           instability of services, feeding a vicious cycle of deteriorating&#13;
the investment required to meet the countryâ&#128;&#153;s water               service standards, and low cost recovery.&#13;
supply and sanitation targets has so far been committed.&#13;
There are also challenges in utilizing this investment            More generally, criteria for allocating finance need to be&#13;
effectively, exacerbated by inadequate road and transport         clarified urgently and capacity building is required to ensure&#13;
infrastructure, geographic inaccessibility, and instability.      improved operation and maintenance of services.&#13;
Nevertheless, the sector, which has long benefited from&#13;
emergency aid, is in transition: it is slowly gaining in          This second AMCOW Country Status Overview (CSO2) has&#13;
structure and long-term development activities are now            been produced in collaboration with the Government of&#13;
starting to be put in place.                                      the Central African Republic and other stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
    Sectorwide&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Develop a coherent framework for managing the sector (policies, technical standards and implementation guidelines&#13;
         for state and non-state actors).&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Ensure improved coordination of activities: improve communication between stakeholders, systematize coordination&#13;
         meetings and agree targets and priorities.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Improve the quantity and reliability of the information produced by sector stakeholders (aid flows and project&#13;
         activities) and set up a sector review.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Build the capacities of sector stakeholders.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Consolidate the role of communes within the decentralization framework: ensure they act systematically as local&#13;
         contracting authority and increase their resources.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Promote community ownership of facilities by increasing community involvement in project planning, design and&#13;
         capacity-building programs.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Increase financing, both domestic and donor, and optimize the financial resources available by increasing the&#13;
         percentage of budget utilized.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Define and strengthen cost recovery mechanisms to ensure facilities remain sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Rural water supply&#13;
â&#128;¢	   In coordination with the private sector, put in place a sustainable system for the maintenance of water supply&#13;
     facilities (boreholes and pumps) and for the provision of spare parts.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Build the capacity of the private sector to ensure the development of a functional market for borehole drilling.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Improve the capacity of committees to manage water points through better supervision and monitoring.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Develop a national program based on actual requirements that includes clearly defined long-term targets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Urban water supply&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Clarify the institutional framework for management of the subsector, which has been in transition since the asset-&#13;
   holding company was dissolved and the Interface Unit was temporarily put in place.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Remedy the funding deficit of the Water Distribution Company of the Central African Republic (SociÃ©tÃ© de&#13;
   Distribution dâ&#128;&#153;Eau de Centrafrique): define a pricing structure that is both socially acceptable and enables operation&#13;
   and maintenance (O&amp;M) cost recovery, and increase efforts to raise funds to rehabilitate and extend water supply&#13;
   facilities.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Bring services in secondary urban centers up to the same standard as those in Bangui.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Increase pro-poor measures and, in particular, social connection campaigns that better target disadvantaged&#13;
   populations and secondary towns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Agree on tools to promote the construction of latrines and implement these.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Address the very low levels of improved hygiene behavior.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Align financing mechanisms to changes in behavior: improvements in hygiene practices are only observed in the&#13;
     medium-term, whereas donor funding mechanisms usually cover a shorter period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
â&#128;¢	   As in rural areas, define and implement tools to promote and develop latrines.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Address the very low levels of improved hygiene behavior.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Promote pit-emptying services: organize the private sector currently active in the market (if appropriate, through a&#13;
     license system that would improve regulation of the sector); resolve the issue of sludge treatment.&#13;
&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated&#13;
this task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank (AfDB) which are&#13;
implementing it in close partnership with the UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has&#13;
been produced in collaboration with the Government of the Central African Republic and other stakeholders during&#13;
2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

Coverage: Assessing Past Progress                                               to 60 percent of the population; in 2008, the access rate&#13;
                                                                                stood at 5 percent. There are, therefore, huge challenges&#13;
Coverage estimates for the Central African Republic (CAR)                       to be overcome. The current pace of development is not&#13;
vary widely depending on their source. The data used                            encouraging, however, and will not enable the targets to&#13;

According to the JMP, the access rate to drinking water          The capital investment requirements for rural water supply&#13;

figure for 2008 is 31.8 percent (see Figure 8), whereas          anticipated for the foreseeable (see Figure 9). According to&#13;
the access rate given by other sources falls somewhere           the CSO2 costing and based on the DGH figures, US$32&#13;
in between. All sources, however, agree that the pace at         million per year will be required in capital investments to&#13;
which the access is increasing is barely sufficient to offset    meet the RWS PASEA target: a total of US$223 million.&#13;

not in a position to meet the PASEA target for rural water       year (see Table 2) are added to this, the total investment&#13;

Figure 10 shows the rural water supply scorecard. The                  Figure 11&#13;
scorecard uses a simple color code to indicate: building               Average RWS scorecard scores for enabling,&#13;
blocks that are largely in place, acting as a driver on                developing, and sustaining service delivery, and&#13;
service delivery (score &gt;2, green); building blocks that               peer group comparison&#13;
are a drag on service delivery and require attention (score&#13;
                                                                                             Enabling&#13;

constituting a barrier to service delivery and a priority for&#13;
reform (score &lt;1, red).&#13;
&#13;
The scorecard indicates that the greatest challenges within&#13;
the RWS subsector relate to developing new services and&#13;
sustaining facilities (Figures 10 and 11). In addition to the&#13;
problems common to all sectors (accessibility, logistics,&#13;
security conditions), the development of new infrastructure                                                 Developing&#13;
                                                                            Sustaining&#13;
is being hampered by factors such as lack of equipment&#13;
(there are only four drilling machines in the whole country)&#13;
and the technical and financial shortcomings of the DGH.                  Central African Republic average scores&#13;
&#13;
These issues are reflected in the low percentage of budget                Averages, LICs, GNI p.p. &lt;=$500&#13;
utilized; this stands at 26 percent for donor financing,               Source: CSO2 scorecard.&#13;
which makes up the majority of funding. Sustaining&#13;
services is also hampered by difficulties in obtaining&#13;
spare parts and in local management of facilities. It is to            little sense of ownership of facilities due, in part, to lack&#13;
be hoped that, once ANEA is in place, the link between                 of involvement during the project design phase, as well&#13;
ad hoc project interventions and ongoing maintenance                   as the paucity of local skills and a prevailing short-term&#13;
can be restored: activities are currently highly dependent             perspective. It is for all these reasons that the results for&#13;
upon donor finance and are often suspended between                     the subsector are significantly below those of the CARâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
projects.                                                              peer group countries (see Figure 11). The subsector is,&#13;

The current severe failings in water supply services in rural          and, based on recent DGH data, the number of facilities&#13;
areas are not only quantitative and qualitative, but also              built over the last 18 months means the outlook is relatively&#13;

           â&#128;¢	    Clarify the institutional framework for management of the subsector, which has been in transition since&#13;
                 the asset-holding company was dissolved and the Interface Unit was temporarily put in place.&#13;
           â&#128;¢	    Remedy SODECAâ&#128;&#153;s funding deficit: define a pricing structure that is both socially acceptable and enables&#13;
                 O&amp;M cost recovery, and increase efforts to raise funds to rehabilitate and extend water supply facilities.&#13;
           â&#128;¢	    Bring services in secondary urban centers up to the same standard as those in Bangui.&#13;
           â&#128;¢	    Increase pro-poor measures and, in particular, social connection campaigns that better target disadvantaged&#13;

 The access rate data for the UWS subsector also differs              Nevertheless, it would appear that the majority of finance&#13;
 depending on the source: according to the JMP, the access            required for UWS (95 percent, or US$14.8 million per&#13;
 rate stood at 92 percent in 2008, starkly contrasting with           year) has been obtained. This is attributable to recent&#13;
 the DGH figure of 27.6 percent (see Figure 12). To reach             commitments made by some DPs, but assumes that this&#13;
 the PASEA target for the urban water supply subsector,               is sustained through to 2015 (Figure 13).&#13;
 the current pace of construction needs to increase seven-&#13;
 fold.                                                                It will, therefore, be necessary to translate these&#13;

 Based on the DGH figures and PASEA target, between                   teams are able to manage the influx of funding and have&#13;

       Priority actions for rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
       â&#128;¢	    Agree on tools to promote the construction of latrines and implement these.&#13;
       â&#128;¢	    Address the very low levels of improved hygiene behavior.&#13;
       â&#128;¢	    Align financing mechanisms to changes in behavior: improvements in hygiene practices are only observed&#13;
             in the medium-term, whereas donor funding mechanisms usually cover a shorter period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The disparity in access rate figures for the rural sanitation   Capital investment requirements, using the CSO2 costing&#13;
 and hygiene (RSH) subsector can be explained by the             model, are estimated to be US$8.9 million per year, with&#13;
 different methodologies and definitions used in the             around US$1 million per year in additional maintenance&#13;
 calculations: 1.7 percent of the rural population has access    and upkeep costs. Around 83 percent of the finance&#13;
 to improved sanitation according to the DGH; 7.7 percent        required between 2009 and 2015 (over US$51 million) is&#13;
 according to a Census conducted in 2003; 28 percent             yet to be mobilized: RSH attracts the least funding from&#13;
 according to the JMP, and 43.1 percent according the            DPs. It, therefore, appears extremely unlikely that the CAR&#13;
 2006 MIC3 survey. Any debate as to which figures are            will attain its target for access to sanitation in rural areas.&#13;
 the most accurate should not be allowed to overshadow&#13;
 the fact that, regardless of the source, the access rate        On-site sanitation is not considered a priority either by&#13;
 is extremely low. At the current rate of progress, and          households or by the majority of institutional stakeholders,&#13;
 based on DGH data, only 1.9 percent of the CARâ&#128;&#153;s rural          who, faced with a crisis situation and implementation&#13;
 population will have access to improved sanitation in           issues, tend to favor the water supply sector. Government&#13;
 2015, against the target set out in the PASEA of 60             agency activity is, therefore, limited to supporting a few&#13;
 percent (see Figure 16).                                        NGO programs, when possible.&#13;

 The JMP estimate of sanitation coverage in urban                    faster to reach the PASEA target for access to sanitation&#13;

 estimate was 11.1 percent for the same year (Figure 20).            Construction is limited to the interventions of NGOs, who&#13;
 Notwithstanding these differences, coverage also needs              generally work on the basis of partial subsidies; these&#13;
 to be considered in light of the fact that most of the              interventions, although positive, have a limited impact.&#13;
 infrastructure is concentrated in Bangui, with other urban&#13;

 African population will have access to improved sanitation&#13;
 in 2015, against the PASEA target of 60 percent.                    Despite the fact that urban sanitation is a cause of concern&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Central
            African Republic : turning finance into services for 2015
            and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of country status overviews (CSOs) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            and what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with United Nations
            Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization
            (WHO) in over 30 countries across SSA. This second CSO
            report has been produced in collaboration with the
            Government of the Central African Republic and other
            stakeholders during 2009-10. The analysis aims to help
            countries assess their own service delivery pathways for
            turning finance into water supply and sanitation services in
            each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and
            rural and urban sanitation and hygiene. The second CSO
            analysis has three main components: a review of past
            coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of future
            investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of
            particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.
            The second CSO's contribution is to answer not only
            whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to
            meet sector targets, but what specific issues need to be
            addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into
            accelerated coverage in water supply and sanitation. In this
            spirit, specific priority actions have been identified
            through consultation. A synthesis report, available
            separately, presents best practice and shared learning to
            help realize these priority actions.
