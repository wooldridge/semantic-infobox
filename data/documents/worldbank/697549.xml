&amp;#12;&#13;
1. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.    Trinidad and Tobago, with a total land area of 5,128 sq km, is located&#13;
at the southern end of the West Indian archipelago. Trinidad, the larger&#13;
island is 4,820 sq km in area and is within sight of the east coast of&#13;
Venezuela. The island's topography is dominated by three parallel ranges of&#13;
hills. The Northern Range, a rugged outlier of the Eastern Cordillera of the&#13;
Andes, the Central Range and the Trinity Hills in the south. Three major&#13;
river systems separate the ranges of hills, forming broad plains, two draining&#13;
westward into the Gulf of Paria (which separates Trinidad from Venezuela),&#13;
and one draining eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Tobago lies 32 km&#13;
northeast of Trinidad and is 303 sq km in area. The island is dominated by&#13;
the Main Ridge of hills, which are most rugged in the north.&#13;
2.    Trinidad and Tobago's climate is tropical with a unimodal rainfall&#13;
pattern which results in two distinct seasons: a wet season from the end of&#13;
May to December and a dry season from January to April. As a result of&#13;
prevailing winds, rainfall is higher in the north-east quadrants of both islands.&#13;
Average annual rainfall ranges from 2,880 mm in the east to 1,200 mm in the&#13;
west. Trinidad, lying just south of the "hurricane belt", has not experienced a&#13;
severe tropical cyclone in recorded history. Tobago is less fortunate and was&#13;
seriously damaged by hurricane Flora in 1963.&#13;
3.    The nation's ethnically diverse population, totalling 1.23 million in&#13;
1990, is dominated by the descendants of people transported from Africa,&#13;
India and other parts of the world to labor on the plantations during the&#13;
colonial era (the indigenous Amerindian population became extinct during the&#13;
last century). Population growth-rate peaked at 1.7 percent per annum in 1985&#13;
and fell to 0.8 percent in 1990, due mainly to emigration. The capital city,&#13;
Port of Spain, has a population of some 80,000. Approximately three-quarters&#13;
of the population are urban dwellers, most inhabiting two conurbations -- the&#13;
Port of Spain-Arima corridor and the Port of Spain-San Fernando corridor.&#13;
4.    Petroleum quickly replaced agriculture as the mainstay of the economy&#13;
following the discovery of oil early this century -- Trinidad's oil was an&#13;
important resource to the Allies during WWII. Industrialization soon&#13;
followed, bringing increasing economic prosperity to the nation. As a result&#13;
of major oil and natural gas finds, the GNP per capita increased from US$960&#13;
in 1972 to over US$6,600 in 1982 but domestic policies of the time failed to&#13;
harness the windfall, and the subsequent fall in international oil prices, coupled&#13;
with declining national oil production, resulted in contraction of the economy.&#13;
In spite of improved economic policies, there has been little economic growth&#13;
in recent years, and estimates put the 1993 GNP per capita at around&#13;
US$3,250. A decade of economic depression, and structural adjustment has&#13;
contributed to increased unemployment (20 percent in 1993), and many people&#13;
have migrated, mainly to North America, to seek employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
B. Pollution&#13;
5.    Trinidad and Tobago's major exports include petroleum products,&#13;
ammonia, iron and steel, fertilizers, methanol, chemicals, and sugar -- all&#13;
potentially polluting industries. Inasmuch as environmental protection was&#13;
not an integral part of the Government's industrialization policy, and without&#13;
effluent and emissions standards, there was no incentive for industry to&#13;
introduce the newer and cleaner technologies being introduced in countries&#13;
where pollution control was being enforced. Exceptions were industries&#13;
involving foreign joint-venture partners which adopted 'headquarters'&#13;
standards. Until recently, pollution has gone on virtually uncontrolled. This&#13;
situation has resulted in a number of environmental reviews which generally&#13;
concluded that the major pollution issues center upon industrial and urban&#13;
effluents -- mainly liquid and gases, solid and hazardous wastes, and pollution&#13;
resulting from destruction of forests in the upper watersheds. Recently, lead&#13;
and noise have been added to the list. Trinidad is more threatened by industrial&#13;
pollution than Tobago, where increasing volumes of sewage from the&#13;
developing tourist industry (the island's major economic activity) is beginning&#13;
to pose a threat.&#13;
(a)    Pollution of Water Resources with pollutants stemming from&#13;
industry is debatably the most important issue. Examples include untreated,&#13;
or partially treated liquid effluent from oil and petrochemical installations,&#13;
breweries and alcohol distilleries, sugar refineries, canning and packaging&#13;
plants; agriculture -- pesticide, herbicide and fertilizer run-off from&#13;
agricultural lands, animal and other organic wastes; urban areas -- detergents,&#13;
sanitary waste and raw and incompletely processed sewage; and activities in&#13;
the upper watersheds -- logging, forest clearing, agricultural activities, and&#13;
quarrying causing soil erosion and siltation of waterways; and mining --&#13;
suspended solids from sand and gravel pits. These pollutants enter streams,&#13;
rivers and wetland areas and, in some cases, percolate into ground water.&#13;
(b)    Solid Waste, stemming from industry and urban sources&#13;
comprising paper, plastic, metal, glass, vegetable and food waste, has been&#13;
identified as a priority issue. Whereas some recycling is practiced, current&#13;
policy is to dispose of the bulk of solid waste in landfills. Issues include the&#13;
prompt collection of waste, its method of transportation and disposal at the&#13;
landfills, and the possible effects of leachate, and smoke and gases from fires&#13;
at the landfill sites. Little is known about the environmental impact of the&#13;
landfills.&#13;
(c)    Hazardous Wastes are, in general, disposed of in the same way&#13;
as other solid and liquid wastes -- into the landfills or the waterways.&#13;
Humans, birds and animals routinely sift the contents of the landfills for items&#13;
of value and are constantly exposed to hospital waste, heavy metals and&#13;
noxious and poisonous chemicals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
(d)   Air Pollution is becoming an increasingly important issue as&#13;
industrialization and urbanization increases. Industrial sources of air pollution&#13;
include gases and particulate emissions created during the refining of&#13;
petroleum products; the smelting of iron, steel and lead; the manufacture of&#13;
ammonia, cement, and the transhipping of bauxite from Guyana. Agricultural&#13;
sources of air pollution include smoke and ash from sugar cane and bagasse&#13;
burning, and land clearing activities. Gaseous and particulate emissions from&#13;
vehicles are another source of air pollution in urban areas -- the majority of&#13;
vehicles use leaded gasoline, and catalytic converters are currently not&#13;
required.&#13;
(e)   Noise Pollution, especially on industrial sites and in urban&#13;
areas, has been an issue for many years, but its economic impact has not been&#13;
quantified.&#13;
C Natural Resources Degradation&#13;
6.    Overview of the Natural Resources of Trinidad and Tobago&#13;
(a)    Land in Trinidad and Tobago is classified on the basis of&#13;
agricultural suitability; fertile land suitable for the production of most tropical&#13;
crops (16 percent), (located primarily in the lower valleys and flood plains of&#13;
major river basins), land which is less suitable for agriculture because of low&#13;
fertility and inadequate drainage (46 percent), (including the clay soils of&#13;
central and southern Trinidad), and land with little or no agricultural value&#13;
(38 percent), (mainly poor, erosion-prone soils on hillsides, and waterlogged&#13;
soils in the estuarine wetlands).&#13;
(b)   Water. Rainfall provides 7.7 billion m3 of fresh water per&#13;
year. The scarcity of good aquifers in both islands results in heavy reliance on&#13;
surface water for potable and industrial uses - 70 percent of the nation's water&#13;
is drawn from rivers and reservoirs. Trinidad has two water-storage dams and&#13;
two river off-take facilities. Tobago has one of each type of facility.&#13;
Estimates indicate that current rates of withdrawal of water from rivers and&#13;
ground-water reserves (90 million m3 per year) are well within the limits of&#13;
resource availability.&#13;
(c)    Vegetation.  Before man modified the landscape, the islands&#13;
were almost entirely forested. Today seven types of natural forest still occur,&#13;
from the mangrove forest of the coastal wetlands to the montane forest at the&#13;
highest elevations of the Northern Range. Although much of the natural forest&#13;
has been cleared for agricultural, residential and industrial development, 60&#13;
percent of the country (307,500 ha) remains forested - although little of it&#13;
remains undisturbed. The State owns over 80 percent of the forest, nearly one&#13;
third of which is preserved with the intention of improving water catchment&#13;
and reducing soil erosion. A significant part of the non-agricultural land in&#13;
Trinidad is wetland -- including three large estuarine and two inland wetlands&#13;
(natural areas of grass and shrubs which are inundated during the rainy&#13;
season).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
(d)   Biodiversity. The wide range of ecological types has resulted&#13;
in Trinidad and Tobago being richly endowed with fauna and flora. Over 100&#13;
species of mammals, 420 species of birds, 70 species of reptiles, 26 species of&#13;
amphibians and 76 species of fresh-water fish have been reported. Over 600&#13;
species of butterflies have been described, but the list of insect fauna is still&#13;
incomplete. The islands' flora is similarly diverse, and 2,300 species of&#13;
flowering plants have been described to date - 86 unique to Trinidad and&#13;
Tobago. Over 200 species of orchids, 200 species of ferns, 58 species of&#13;
bromeliads and 34 species of aroids are recorded. Many more species of flora&#13;
await identification and classification.&#13;
(e)    Coastal and Marine Resources.  Trinidad and Tobago's&#13;
Exclusive Economic Zone is 15 times larger than its land area, and is&#13;
economically vital to the nation's interests as some 80 percent of its oil is&#13;
obtained offshore. Marine conditions are strongly influenced by the huge&#13;
volume of freshwater which enters the sea from the Orinoco Delta, reducing&#13;
the salinity of coastal waters, and carries sediments which create turbidity and&#13;
prevent the development of coral in the waters around Trinidad. The nation's&#13;
700 km coastline comprises scenic cliffs, sandy beaches, and wetlands - the&#13;
base for a substantial fishing industry, as well as supporting recreational and&#13;
tourist activity. On Trinidad, the three major rivers have created estuarine&#13;
wetlands where their waters meet the sea. Tobago has a number of smaller,&#13;
ecologically important, wetlands.&#13;
7.    Natural Resources Management Issues. The islands were initially&#13;
exploited for their agricultural potential, and during the 18th and 19th&#13;
Centuries cocoa, sugar and cotton were the dominant crops, mainly produced&#13;
under the plantation system. Later, citrus, coffee, coconuts and tonka beans&#13;
became important. Most of the better soils of the plains, undulating hills and&#13;
foothills of the western end of the Northern Range were under plantations by&#13;
the end of the last century. Forests were exploited for their timber for mainly&#13;
local use, as the hardness of many of the local woods discouraged European&#13;
importers. When industrialization got under way after the discovery of oil at&#13;
the turn of the century, on-shore installations, storage and loading facilities&#13;
and eventually petrochemical refineries were constructed. The availability of&#13;
oil and natural gas soon attracted metal and chemical industries, and together&#13;
with the rapid urbanization of the country during the "oil-boom" of the 1970s&#13;
and 80s, the stage was set for the rapid deterioration of the nation's renewable&#13;
natural resources. Important natural resources management issues include the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)    Soil and Water Conservation.  The deforestation of hillsides&#13;
through logging, land clearing for agriculture, quarrying, and property&#13;
development has resulted in soil erosion, leaving large areas of barren hillsides&#13;
which are unable to retain rainfall, resulting in flash floods, injuries and loss&#13;
of life and property damage. The burden of suspended solids in the rivers&#13;
clog the filters of the water pumps of the Water and Sewerage Authority&#13;
(responsible for providing the nation's water supply), adding significantly to&#13;
the agency's operating costs, and reducing the quality of the water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
(b)   Loss of Ecosystems and Biodiversity. The destruction of&#13;
ecosystems caused by agricultural, industrial, and urban development has put&#13;
many species of plants and animals under threat of extinction. In common&#13;
with other countries, Trinidad and Tobago traditionally regarded wetlands as&#13;
waste-areas, suitable for industrial development, and one of the nation's major&#13;
landfills is located on the margins of the Caroni Swamp, a major wetland --&#13;
which includes a nature reserve that Government plans to establish as a&#13;
national park. The actions of many of the inhabitants of the country have&#13;
seriously impacted on the nationl's biodiversity. Sea-turtles were traditionally&#13;
regarded as a free source of meat, and the animals were killed indiscriminately&#13;
as they came on to the beaches to lay their eggs. Hunters shot and trapped the&#13;
large mammals and birds of the forest for the much prized game meat -- often&#13;
disregarding close-seasons, and setting trap-guns which kill and maim&#13;
indiscriminately. Tiny song-birds were captured for sale to local and overseas&#13;
caged-bird enthusiasts. River pollution has reduced the populations of fish,&#13;
amphibians and mammals (e.g the maniatee) in the nation's streams, rivers,&#13;
wetlands, and coastal waters. The famous Buccoo marine reef off the coast of&#13;
Tobago has been seriously damaged by human activity -- particularly boat&#13;
operators. Facilities for the proper treatment of sewage and other liquid&#13;
effluent from the increasing number of hotels on the coast adjacent to the reef&#13;
are inadequate, further endangering the reef.&#13;
(c)    Sand Mining. In Tobago, the construction industry has&#13;
traditionally used beach-sand. With the recent expansion in tourism&#13;
infrastructure it has been suggested the rate of usage is exceeding the rate of&#13;
natural replenishment, with the real danger of depleting a valuable tourism&#13;
resource.  With the likelihood of additional hotels, holiday apartments and&#13;
infrastructure it is foreseeable that the construction industry may erode the&#13;
very beaches which attract the tourists.&#13;
D. Legal and Institutionial Background&#13;
8.    In the past, there has been no integrated approach to the management&#13;
of the environment in Trinidad and Tobago, the concept being more associated&#13;
with conservation of wildlife and nature preservation than with pollution&#13;
control. However recent governments have become increasingly aware of&#13;
environmental issues, sensitized initially by the UN Conference on the Human&#13;
Environment (Stockholm 1972). Since that time successive governments have&#13;
attempted to formulate environmental policy, enact environmental legislation&#13;
and design systems to manage the environment. Environmental Protection&#13;
Bills were drafted in 1976 and 1989, but were never brought to Parliament.&#13;
9.    As environmental issues became of increasing importance, institutional&#13;
responsibilities for environmental management changed. Following the&#13;
Stockholm Conference, an Institute for Marine Affairs was established with&#13;
some environmental responsibilities, (mainly involving collection, analysis and&#13;
dissemination of information). During the 1970s, responsibility for the&#13;
environment was switched back and forth between the Ministries of&#13;
Agriculture and Health until, in 1981, the latter became the Ministry of Health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
and the Environment: the first time that the word "Environment" achieved&#13;
such a high profile. National consultations, studies and reports carried out by&#13;
PAHO (1987, 1991), the Economic Commission for Latin America and the&#13;
Caribbean (ECLAC) in conjunction with UNEP (1988), and IDB (1992), urged&#13;
GoRIT to create a specialized agency to manage the nation's environment.&#13;
Successive governments responded in various ways, by appointing committees,&#13;
holding consultations etc., and in 1989, the government of the day took the&#13;
major step of establishing the Ministry of Environment and National Service,&#13;
transferring the Environmental Management and Forestry Divisions from the&#13;
Ministry of Food Production and Marine Exploitation. A change of&#13;
government in 1991 brought a strong commitment to improve environmental&#13;
management, consistent with an election pledge. The Ministry of the&#13;
Environment and National Service of the previous government was disbanded&#13;
and the environmental portfolio transferred to the MoPaD, to integrate&#13;
environmental management with the planning and development portfolio,&#13;
thereby giving the environmental agenda greater leverage and focus. As part&#13;
of this process, MoPaD's Town and Country Planning Division was made&#13;
responsible for environmental impact assessment'. The new Government took&#13;
advantage of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development&#13;
(Rio de Janeiro - June 1992), as an opportunity to present its National Report&#13;
on Environment and Development in which it gave an undertaking to&#13;
develop a new legal and institutional framework for the management of the&#13;
nation's environment.&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Brief Description&#13;
Current Program of Reforms in the Policy, Legal and Institutionial&#13;
Framework for Environmental Management&#13;
10.   The Government has embarked upon a comprehensive overhaul of the&#13;
policy, legal and institutional framework for environmental management. The&#13;
Minister of Planning and Development is currently responsible for the&#13;
environmental portfolio. In addition to the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Development, 27 other government agencies are involved in environment-&#13;
related activities (see Annex C), acting largely in a policy vacuum and without&#13;
central coordination. Recognizing both of these drawbacks, MoPaD, using&#13;
funds from the World Bank Technical Assistance Loan, engaged a consultant&#13;
in 1992 to coordinate the establishment of a specialized agency for the&#13;
management of the nation's environment. The decision to create an agency&#13;
outside of the ministerial structure was taken for a number of reasons,&#13;
including greater flexibility in procurement and recruitment regulations and&#13;
1.    The capacity of the TCPD to undertake and provide training in EIA is currently&#13;
being strengthened by the World Bank financed Business Expansion and Industrial&#13;
Reconstruction Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
improved terms and conditions of employment and remuneration. It was also&#13;
considered important that the agency should be insulated as far as possible&#13;
from political influence. This institutional arrangement also provides for a&#13;
greater degree of involvement of environmental stakeholders outside of&#13;
government (including the private sector and the NGOs).&#13;
11.   After meeting stakeholders and reviewing relevant reports, the&#13;
consultant prepared a Policy Brief which provided profiles on the current&#13;
situation vis a vis environmental management and legislation, recommended an&#13;
interim environmental policy, and identified the steps necessary to establish the&#13;
environmental agency as a statutory body. The document emphasized the need&#13;
for new legislation to establish the new agency, outlined a management&#13;
framework and recommended an action plan to bring all of this into being.&#13;
The Policy Brief was submitted to Cabinet in March 1993, which adopted its&#13;
recommendations, and directed that legislation be drafted to create an agency&#13;
to be known as the Environmental Management Authority (EMA). Shortly&#13;
after, work began on drafting the Environmental Management Act with the&#13;
assistance of a UNDP consultant.&#13;
12.   To address the lack of a national environmental policy the Policy Brief&#13;
recommended that Government adopt a "mission statement" as an interim&#13;
policy before empowering the proposed EMA to formulate a national&#13;
environmental policy. Cabinet accepted this recommendation. The&#13;
Environmental Management Act makes provision for the proposed EMA to&#13;
play a major role in the preparation of environmental policy for government's&#13;
consideration and enactment. A Policy Letter (Annex B) clarifies GoRTT's&#13;
long term policy objectives for the environment.&#13;
13.   Currently, there are approximately 40 pieces of legislation that have&#13;
relevance to environmental management. Many of these overlap resulting in&#13;
conflicting responsibilities among agencies, and much of the legislation is in&#13;
need of redrafting. It is Government's intention to resolve this unsatisfactory&#13;
situation and the Environmental Management Act makes specific provision for&#13;
the EMA to take responsibility for reviewing, updating and where necessary&#13;
preparing new legislation.&#13;
14.   The draft Environmental Management Bill was circulated by&#13;
Government for public comment during August and September 1994.&#13;
Seventy five written comments were received. After revising the draft to&#13;
incorporate many of the suggestions resulting from the public review process,&#13;
and after obtaining the clearance of the Legislative Review Committee, the&#13;
final draft was tabled before Parliament on December 20, 1994. After debates&#13;
in the Senate and later the Lower House, the Bill was finally passed with some&#13;
amendments on February 21, 1995.&#13;
15.   Project Objectives. In support of Government's environmental policy,&#13;
the proposed Environmental Management Project has two main objectives:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
*     To put in place the necessary institutional arrangements for the&#13;
regulation, and management of the environment.&#13;
*     To define, and support a priority environmental work program,&#13;
based on a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).&#13;
16.   Main Features cf the Project. A matrix of key project activities is&#13;
shown as Schedule A, and the Project Implementation Schedules as Annex I.&#13;
In order to address the above objectives, the project would provide support&#13;
for:&#13;
*     MoPaD to oversee the operationalization of the&#13;
Environimental Management Authority, including recruitment&#13;
of key professional staff, and to initiate key activities.&#13;
*     the Environmental Management Authority to enable the new&#13;
agency to recruit staff, procure equipment, undertake studies&#13;
and become fully operational as quickly as possible;&#13;
*     agencies involved in the implementation of the EMA's&#13;
mandates (referred to as Participating Agencies).&#13;
*     Traiiiiiig and Technical Assistance to the EMA and&#13;
Participating Agencies, and;&#13;
*     Studies and formulating Plans.&#13;
B. Detailed Project Features&#13;
17.   Support to the Mlinistry of Planning and Development (US$1.23&#13;
million, over 12 months). The proposed project would support MoPaD to&#13;
begin a public awareness program, start-up a number of key studies, and&#13;
operationalize the new agency. To assist the MoPaD staff, the project would&#13;
provide both long and short-term consultants (some of the UNDP grant is&#13;
already being used to finance a Senior Adviser and some short term inputs).&#13;
The work of MoPaD, in this regard, will be overseen by an Environmental&#13;
Task Force2 comprising 10 senior persons from the public, private and NGO&#13;
sectors. MoPaD will focus on the following key activities:&#13;
*     a public-awareness program intended to impress the importance&#13;
of sound environmental management on all strata of society;&#13;
*     an environmental training program for the public and private&#13;
sectors, at all levels of staff seniority and including&#13;
Parliamentarians;&#13;
2.    It is likely that some of the individuals nominated to the Environmental Task Force&#13;
would become members of the EMA Board of Directors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
*     key studies including a National Environmental Action Plan&#13;
(NEAP), and a National Environmental Information Study&#13;
(NEIS); and&#13;
*     operationalizing the EMA by identifying and recruiting key staff&#13;
for the EMA, securing suitable office accommodation for the&#13;
agency, and begin the procurement of office equipment and&#13;
vehicles.&#13;
In recognition of the urgency of starting many of the above activities as soon&#13;
as possible, UNDP has already provided US$0.95 million in grant funding (see&#13;
Annex D. Activities not funded by UNDP would be eligible for support from&#13;
the Bank loan, retroactively if required. MoPaD's involvement in the project&#13;
would diminish after the EMA becomes operational.&#13;
18.   As noted, Government has provided a policy letter (Annex B)&#13;
describing the Government's objectives and priority actions for environmental&#13;
management, together with a schedule for achieving these actions. It has also&#13;
provided an assurance (Annex E) that adequate provision for local counterpart&#13;
funding for the non-salary expenses to be incurred during the first year of the&#13;
project was included in the Government's 1995 Budget. During negotiations,&#13;
Government assured the Bank that MoPaD would implement the project until&#13;
the EMA has become fully operational (Para 42(b)(i)).&#13;
19.   Operationalization of the Environmental Management Authority&#13;
(US$3.12 million over four years). The proposed project would finance the&#13;
start up costs and support the cost of operating the new Environmental&#13;
Management Authority during the project period. The Borrower gave&#13;
assurances at negotiations that the EMA would be established with a Board of&#13;
Directors and a Chief Executive Officer appointed as condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness, and would thereafter maintain the Agency with responsibilities,&#13;
functions, structure, funds, facilities, management and staff, satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
20.   The Environmental Management Act provides for an 11 person Board&#13;
of Directors to govern the EMA. The Board will be appointed by the&#13;
President of Trinidad and Tobago, acting on the advice of the Cabinet of&#13;
Ministers, and will be accountable to the Minister responsible for the&#13;
environment (currently the Minister of Planning and Development). The&#13;
Board, to be appointed by April 30, 1995, will be multidisciplinary and&#13;
members will be drawn from a wide cross section of disciplines and groups,&#13;
including environmental management, ecology, environmental health,&#13;
engineering, labor, community-based organizations, business, economics,&#13;
public administration, law and non-governmental organizations. The Board is&#13;
responsible for formulating EMA policy, and the Chief Executive Officer will&#13;
be responsible for its implementation. The Authority is permitted to set up&#13;
committees, working groups and advisory councils to assist it to carry out its&#13;
statutory functions and responsibilities. By these means, wide involvement of&#13;
diverse groups in the operations of the Authority will be facilitated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
21.   The broad functions of the Environmental Management Authority, as&#13;
set out in Section 16 (1) of the Environmental Management Act (1995), are:&#13;
*     recommend national environmental policies;&#13;
*     develop and implement policies and programs for the effective&#13;
management and wise use of the environment;&#13;
*     coordinate environmental management functions;&#13;
*     recommend ways to rationalize the environmental management&#13;
system to increase efficiency and achieve economies where&#13;
possible;&#13;
*     promote public awareness;&#13;
*     set national environmental standards and criteria;&#13;
monitor compliance and take enforcement action;&#13;
prevent and control pollution and foster conservation of the&#13;
environment; and&#13;
establish and coordinate linkages at local, regional and&#13;
international levels.&#13;
22.   The EMA's operating system and structure will be articulated by the&#13;
Board of Directors and executive management, once these are in place.&#13;
However, an indicative organizational structure has been developed and&#13;
approved by Government for the purposes of starting up the new Authority.&#13;
The day-to-day tasks of the EMA would be the subject of an Operations&#13;
Manual (financed by UNDP) to be compiled under the supervision of the&#13;
incoming management of the EMA (outline provided in Annex F). The&#13;
interim organizational structure for the agency comprises:&#13;
*     The Chief Executive's Office -- staffed by the Managing&#13;
Director (responsible to the Board of Directors for the operation&#13;
of the EMA) and support staff.&#13;
*     Administration Unit -- responsible for personnel matters,&#13;
procurement, financial control, and general office&#13;
administration. Staff would include an Administrative Officer,&#13;
Procurement Assistant, Book-keeper, Driver/Mechanic and&#13;
support staff.&#13;
*     Information and Education Unit -- responsible for obtaining,&#13;
maintaining and making available information pertaining to the&#13;
environmental affairs. The unit would also be responsible for&#13;
the educational and training activities of the Authority (including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
public awareness). The staff of the unit would include Officers&#13;
responsible for Information, Complaints, Training, and&#13;
Education. They would be supported by a Research Assistant&#13;
and support personnel.&#13;
*      Planning Unit -- responsible for the studies, planning and&#13;
research activities to be carried out by the Authority, including&#13;
the rationalization studies and other studies described below.&#13;
Following the outcome of the rationalization studies the unit&#13;
would coordinate the environmental management activities of the&#13;
"Participating Agencies". The unit would be staffed by a&#13;
Planning Officer together with appropriate support personnel.&#13;
*      Legal Unit -- responsible for all legal matters pertaining to the&#13;
environment and the enforcement and compliance of the laws,&#13;
customs and practices relating to environmental management.&#13;
The staff of the unit would include Legal and Compliance&#13;
Officers with appropriate secretarial support.&#13;
*       'Control/Technical Unit -- responsible for environmental&#13;
surveillance, prevention and control of pollution, and provision&#13;
of advice and support in technical aspects of environmental&#13;
management. The unit would be staffed by up to five Technical&#13;
Officers with secretarial support. The number and type of&#13;
technical specialists required would be determined according to&#13;
the priorities established by the NEAP (see para. 29).&#13;
23.    The project design includes provision for the staff complement of the&#13;
EMA to reach approximately 20 professionals within the term of the project,&#13;
together with appropriate levels of secretarial and administrative support - the&#13;
minimum considered necessary to carry out the functions of the Authority.&#13;
The professional staff would be supplemented as required by short term&#13;
consultants sourced locally and/or internationally. Similarly, during periods of&#13;
peak activity, temporary support personnel would be contracted in to&#13;
supplement the pernanent administrative staff. It is recognized that as the&#13;
work of the agency builds up, additional staff may be required. This topic&#13;
would be addressed in detail during the mid-term review (para. 32). In terms&#13;
of staff build-up, the Managing Director and staff of the Chief Executive's&#13;
Office and the Administration Unit, and the Complaints Officer would be the&#13;
3.     Some additional short term consultants may, for example, be needed to assist in the&#13;
supervision of the relatively large number of technical studies that are being&#13;
conducted within this project. The costs of these consultants have been included&#13;
within the study costs. During project appraisal, it was determined that ample local&#13;
capacity exisLs in a number of local and regional institutions to provide such&#13;
expertise. In particular, the following major agencies have been identified: Institute&#13;
of Marine Affairs; Caribbean Industrial Research Institub; University of the West&#13;
Indies; Bureau of Standards; Water and Sewerage Authority; Chemnistry, Food and&#13;
Drug Division (Ministry of Health); National Institue for Higher Education,&#13;
Research, Science and Technology; and, Solid Waste Management Co. Ltd.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
first to be recruited (targeted for July 1995). The staff of the other functional&#13;
units would be recruited over the following three months. The professional&#13;
qualifications of the Technical Officers selected would depend on the priorities&#13;
established by the NEAP. MoPaD proposes to advertise internationally to fill&#13;
the professional positions in the EMA. Priority would be given to the&#13;
recruitment of suitably qualified and experienced nationals of Trinidad and&#13;
Tobago locally or from abroad. Remuneration packages, considered by&#13;
GoRTT (and shown by experience) to be attractive to returning nationals,&#13;
would be offered. In cases where it is not possible to fill positions with&#13;
nationals, applications from non-nationals would be considered and&#13;
appointments made on a contract basis. In these cases, individual&#13;
remuneration packages would be negotiated on a case by case basis within&#13;
existing GoRTT guidelines. The project would finance salaries and&#13;
operational costs of the EMA with GoRTT's contribution increasing from zero&#13;
percent at the start of the project to 100 percent at the end (para. 39).&#13;
24.   Office accommodation for the new agency would be provided by&#13;
GoRTT, which has adequate existing space in buildings owned or leased by&#13;
the state property company. No provision has been made in the project for&#13;
substantial renovations or refurbishment, however, an allocation has been&#13;
made to permit internal modifications to the selected property, as required.&#13;
25.   Support to the Participating Agencies. (US$3.51 million over four&#13;
years). The Government, in its letter of January 27, 1995 has identified the&#13;
key Participating Agencies (see Annex C), which would receive institutional&#13;
strengthening support from the project from the outset. The EMA, as soon as&#13;
it is operational, will draw up and agree a Memorandum of Understanding&#13;
(MoU) with each agency, establishing the details of the relationship between&#13;
the Authority and the agency. Within the MoU, Envirommental Officers, to&#13;
be selected from among the staff of each Participating Agency, would be&#13;
identified. These officers would act as contact points for liaison between the&#13;
EMA and the agency. The Environmental Officers would receive special&#13;
training from the EMA Education Training Division to prepare them for their&#13;
new responsibilities. GoRTT recognizes that the EMA will require support&#13;
from agencies not among those identified as "key" agencies. To select these,&#13;
the EMA plans to carry out rationalization studies which, inter alia, would&#13;
determine the most appropriate ministries and public agencies to take on major&#13;
environmental management responsibilities, and delineate their functions (see&#13;
para. 29). Once the EMA's selection of a Participating Agency is ratified by&#13;
Government (a Cabinet decision), and a MoU agreed with the EMA, the&#13;
agency would become eligible for project support in the form of office&#13;
equipment, training and technical assistance as identified within the plans&#13;
resulting from the rationalization studies. The new Participating Agencies&#13;
would be linked into the National Environmental Management Information&#13;
System which the project would support (based on the findings and&#13;
recommendations of the proposed NEIS study -- para. 29). NEMIS would not&#13;
only interlink each Participating Agency with the national data base that the&#13;
EMA will establish within its Information Division, but also enable the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Environmental Officers to exchange information internationally, and access the&#13;
major international environmental data bases. To facilitate this the project&#13;
would establish an Internet communications node to facilitate the operation of&#13;
the network.&#13;
26.   At negotiations, Government gave assurance that the EMA would carry&#13;
out the project with the cooperation of the Participating Agencies (para.&#13;
42(b)(ii)), and that the institutional framework for environmental management,&#13;
including the Participating Agencies, would be reviewed through a series of&#13;
Rationalization Studies which would be completed no later than 18 months&#13;
after effectiveness (para. 42(b)(xi)).&#13;
27.   Training and Training-Related Technical Assistance (US$1.86&#13;
million over four years). Training programs would be implemented under&#13;
MoPaD initially. The EMA's Information and Education Unit will take over&#13;
responsibility as soon as it is operational. Provision has been made within the&#13;
project to support substantial amounts of training and training-related technical&#13;
assistance. The training would:&#13;
*     improve the knowledge-base of staff in MoPaD, the EMA, the&#13;
Participating Agencies, other public servants and the general&#13;
public;&#13;
*     strengthen the technical and managerial capabilities of relevant&#13;
staff in MoPaD, the EMA and the Participating Agencies; and&#13;
*     strengthen the environmental information network both locally&#13;
and internationally.&#13;
28.   The project would provide Technical and Training Advisers for 31&#13;
person-months of "on-the-job" training in specialized areas. The&#13;
findings/recommendations of the NEAP would determine the thematic focus of&#13;
the training - topics such as Environmental Impact Assessment, Pollution&#13;
Standards, Laboratory QA/QC Standards, Remedial/ Reclamation Standards,&#13;
Public Participation Guidelines, and Environmental Audit are likely priorities.&#13;
The project would also provide funding for Information, Training and&#13;
Educational Activities including Technical Assistance to determine the library&#13;
needs of the EMA and requirements for additional environmental&#13;
documentation. The project also includes funds to: procure documents and&#13;
library equipment; finance the reporting of environmental complaints; prepare&#13;
State of the Environment Reports; prepare reports required by International&#13;
Environmental Treaties; and purchase materials and cover expenses required&#13;
for public awareness campaigns, curriculum development and environmental&#13;
education activities. Provision is made for the training of EMA staff and&#13;
Environmental Officers in the Participating Agencies in the form of both short&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
and long term formal training. Further details of the proposed Training and&#13;
Training-Related Technical Assistance Component, including Terms of&#13;
Reference for the EMA Training Officer and the Training Adviser, and&#13;
generic training programs are presented in Annex G.&#13;
29.   Studies and Planning Exercises (US$0.78 million over four years).&#13;
The proposed project would support several priority studies which would&#13;
commence under the supervision of MoPaD and be completed under the&#13;
supervision of the EMA. These studies would contribute to the environmental&#13;
knowledge base of Trinidad and Tobago, identify priorities for the EMA's&#13;
work program and generally improve the efficiency of environmental&#13;
management in the country. Studies would be carried out with a view to&#13;
establishing an efficient system for the coordination of environmental&#13;
management centered on the EMA and the Participating Agencies and to&#13;
provide a medium term development plan for the EMA. Specifically, the&#13;
project would support the following studies to be started under MoPaD's&#13;
supervision and completed under that of the EMA: (a) the preparation of a&#13;
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP). The priority work program&#13;
of the EMA would be developed from the NEAP, (b) a series of&#13;
Rationalization Studies), to identify possible efficiencies and economies to be&#13;
gained by reorganizing the institutional framework for environmental&#13;
management, and to identify the institutional strengthening requirements of the&#13;
Participating Agencies; and (c) a needs analysis for establishing a National&#13;
Environmental Information System ("the NEIS Study"). The studies would&#13;
be carried out by consultants under the EMA's supervision, and the finding&#13;
and recommendations conveyed to Government for approval and&#13;
implementation as appropriate. Draft terms of reference for these studies are&#13;
included in Annex H.&#13;
30.   Further studies would commence once the EMA has become fully&#13;
operational, including: (a) the preparation of an inventory of sources of&#13;
pollutants ("Pollutant Inventory Study"); (b) the preparation of an&#13;
environmental management database to include all projects with environmental&#13;
implications in Trinidad and Tobago ("MIS Study"); (c) the design of a public&#13;
participation campaign, formal and non-formal education on environmental&#13;
topics, a formal training program and on-the-job-training for agency staff and&#13;
Environmental Officers ("Training Design Study"); (d) a study to evaluate&#13;
needs and potential for adopting alternative mediation schemes ("Alternative&#13;
Mediation Study"); (e) two studies relating to the Polluter Pays Principle&#13;
(PPP) -- one to demonstrate the use of economic instruments as complements&#13;
to strict regulatory controls, and the other to show where PPP is relevant to&#13;
Trinidad and Tobago's circumstances -- ("PPP Incentive Studies"); (f) a study&#13;
to explore alternative means of financing environmental initiatives&#13;
("Innovative Finance Mechanism Study"); and (g) a study to illustrate the&#13;
use and potential for local application of natural resource and environmental&#13;
accounting methods, ("NREA Study"). Terms of Reference for these studies&#13;
are also presented in Annex G.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
31.   Government gave its assurances at negotiations that it would prepare a&#13;
National Environmental Action Plan, acceptable to the Bank; submit a report&#13;
of the NEAP to the Bank not later that 12 months after effectiveness; and&#13;
subsequently carry out the plan (para. 42(b)(x)).&#13;
32.   Reports and Reviews. The EMA would prepare an Annual Report,&#13;
by the end of September of each year, in which it would review the&#13;
performance of the project during the previous 12 month period, and propose a&#13;
work-plan, together with estimated funding requirements, for the next 12&#13;
months (para. 42(b)(iv)). The Annual Report to be prepared in the last year of&#13;
the project (1999) would include the results of a survey to determine the&#13;
"person in the street's" opinions of the performance of the new Authority.&#13;
Using the Annual Reports as a basis, a joint GoRITT/Bank Annual Review&#13;
would be carried out during October of each year (in conjunction with a Bank&#13;
supervision) (para. 41(b)(v)). The Annual Review would be completed by the&#13;
end of October to permit the incorporation of agreed financial estimates into&#13;
the government's annual budget (which is finalized in November). In addition&#13;
to the annual reports and reviews, the Government would hire consultants&#13;
(under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank), to prepare a Mid-Term&#13;
P-rformance-Evaluation Report before the end of the second year of the&#13;
project, and after the completion of the NEAP (para. 42(b)(vi)), and to submit&#13;
the report to the Bank not later than 28 months after effectiveness (para.&#13;
42(b)(vii)). Using this latter report as a basis, GoRTT and the Bank would&#13;
jointly undertake a Midterm Review to evaluate the impact of the activities&#13;
supported by the project and results achieved. This review would be&#13;
completed not later that 30 months after project effectiveness (para.&#13;
42(b)(viii)). Specifically the review would evaluate the adequacy of the&#13;
structure, staff complement and operational plan of the EMA, and recommend&#13;
changes as appropriate. Should progress be considered unsatisfactory, at the&#13;
request of the Bank, GoRTT would prepare a plan of action, based on the&#13;
findings of the mid-term review, setting out how it would address the shortfall&#13;
in progress (para. 42(b)(ix)). Government gave assurances at negotiations that&#13;
the above mentioned reports and reviews would be carried out.&#13;
C. Estimated Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
33.   The proposed project is estimated to cost US$10.5 million equivalent,&#13;
excluding duties and taxes, with a foreign exchange component of US$4.85&#13;
million as detailed in Annex A. Costs were calculated using projected January&#13;
1995 prices and include a physical contingency of five percent. Price&#13;
contingencies over the financing period were computed based on expected&#13;
international price increases for goods and services as estimated by the Bank in&#13;
May 1994. Purchasing Power Parity was assumed to hold for the TT$/US$&#13;
exchange rate over the projected implementation period. Physical and price&#13;
contingencies total US$0.93 million for all components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
34.   Project Financing. The proposed IBRD loan of US$6.25 million&#13;
would finance 60 percent of total project costs, equivalent to 100 percent of&#13;
the foreign exchange costs, and 25 percent of local costs. The balance of&#13;
project costs would be financed by UNDP, (parallel financing of US$0.95&#13;
million in the form of two grants), and by GoRTT, (US$3.3 million). The&#13;
Government of Trinidad and Tobago would be the borrower and would make&#13;
the proceeds of the loan available on a grant basis to MoPaD for start up&#13;
operations, and to the EMA within the provisions of a subsidiary agreement,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank -- para 42(c)(ii). Through MoPaD, the project would&#13;
finance vehicles and equipment, studies, technical assistance and training, as&#13;
required to start up the project. Through the EMA the project would finance&#13;
the agency's operations including staff costs, materials and supplies, training,&#13;
technical assistance and studies, as well as institutional strengthening of the&#13;
Participating Agencies in the field of environmental management -- para.&#13;
42(b)(ii).&#13;
3. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION&#13;
A. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
35.   Role of the Ministry of Planning and Development (MoPaD).&#13;
MoPaD has been the co-ordinating ministry responsible for the preparation of&#13;
the legal and administrative arrangements for the creation of the EMA.&#13;
MoPaD will continue to be responsible for the EMA until the new Authority&#13;
becomes operational. GoRlT plans to inaugurate the EMA during June,&#13;
1995, but it is not anticipated that the Authority would become fully&#13;
operational until some three-four months later. Until EMA has become fully&#13;
operational, MoPaD would be the executing agency for implementing the&#13;
proposed project. Priority activities during this period will focus on recruiting&#13;
staff for the EMA, selecting office accommodation, and procuring equipment&#13;
and supplies. In addition, MoPaD will supervise the priority activities already&#13;
funded by UNDP, including a public awvareness campaign and training&#13;
activities, and start up key studies including the NEAP and the NEIS - both&#13;
important determinants of the EMA's priorities and initial work plan. MoPaD&#13;
has recruited consultants to supplement its regular staff to carry out its&#13;
responsibilities to the EMA and would recruit additional people as the work&#13;
load build up. For procurement and management of financial aspects of&#13;
project implementation, MoPaD will make use of the expertise within its&#13;
Restructuring Support Unit (RSU), which has substantial experience of&#13;
administering projects funded by the Bank and IDB.&#13;
36.   Role of the EMA. Once the EMA has become fully operational, i.e.&#13;
once its Board of Directors, CEO, Administrative Director and key&#13;
professional and support staff have been recruited and have worked together as&#13;
a team for a period of three to four months, the EMA would take over as lead&#13;
executing agency for the project. Consultants employed by MoPaD would be&#13;
eligible to apply for positions within the EMA. Responsibility for&#13;
procurement and financial control of the project will be transferred from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
MoPaD's RSU to the EMA once the staff to be responsible for these functions&#13;
have been trained. The RSU will train the procurement staff in the EMA and&#13;
continue to provide oversight and advice, as required, throughout the&#13;
implementation period.&#13;
37.   The EMA would be responsible for implementing the proposed&#13;
program of support to the Participating Agencies. The arrangements for such&#13;
support would be established in the Memoranda of Understanding that would&#13;
be drawn up between the EMA and each Agency. A Project Implementation&#13;
Plan with Monitoring Indicators is attached as Schedule A (pages 36-40), and&#13;
Implementation Schedules are presented as Annex I (pages 103-105).&#13;
B. Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
38.   The Borrower has given assurances that procurement of goods and&#13;
consulting services financed by the Bank under the project would follow&#13;
procedures satisfactory to the Bank (para. 42(b)(xiii)). There are no civil&#13;
works expected under this project. Goods, including vehicles, computers and&#13;
office equipment, would be procured under Limited International Bidding&#13;
(LIB) procedures for all contracts in excess of US$25,000. Where possible,&#13;
the procurement of like goods, including computer hardware, would be&#13;
grouped and bids solicited under LIB procedures from suppliers with&#13;
established service and maintenance facilities in the country. Contracts for&#13;
goods valued at less than US$25,000, up to an aggregate of US$250,000,&#13;
would be purchased on the basis of price quotations from at least three eligible&#13;
suppliers. The selection and appointment of consultants for studies and&#13;
technical assistance financed from loan funds would be consistent with the&#13;
August 1981 Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by Ubrld Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency. As described above,&#13;
the Restructuring Support Unit of MoPaD will be responsible for procurement&#13;
of goods and services financed under this project from Bank funds until such&#13;
time as the EMA has become fully operational, and has established&#13;
procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank. Prior Review of&#13;
procurement documentation would be required for all LIB contracts (for&#13;
vehicles and equipment) and for all consulting services above US$50,000 for&#13;
individual consultants and US$100,000 for consultants' firms. This review&#13;
would include terms of reference, short lists, and contracts.&#13;
39.   Disbursements. The proposed Bank loan of US$6.25 million would be&#13;
disbursed over a period of four and a half years (Annex A). The standard&#13;
disbursement profile for Technical Assistance projects in Latin America and&#13;
the Caribbean, dated August 1993 (a six and one half year profile) was not&#13;
used, since this project has been designed to provide short-term concentrated&#13;
support for GoRIT to start up the new Authority during a period of financial&#13;
austerity. GoRIT is confident that the project would fully disburse within the&#13;
shorter time frame. The Bank would reimburse Government for eligible&#13;
expenditures incurred by MoPaD during the start up period, by the EMA, and&#13;
by the Participating Agencies at a rate of 100 percent of foreign expenditures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
for goods, including vehicles, computers and office equipment, and 85 percent&#13;
for locally procured goods (US$1.35 million), and 100 percent for foreign&#13;
consultants and foreign training costs and 85 percent for local consultants and&#13;
local training costs (US$3.15 million). Disbursements would be limited to an&#13;
aggregate of US$1.75 million for the following: project related incremental&#13;
salaries, labor costs and operating expenses for maintenance, materials and&#13;
supplies for MoPaD and the EMA. The project would finance 100 percent of&#13;
such eligible expenses up to an amount disbursed equivalent to US$1.00&#13;
million; 75 percent up to an amount disbursed equivalent to US$1.45 million,&#13;
and 50 percent thereafter until the US$1.75 million has been fully disbursed,&#13;
by which time GoRTT would take on full responsibility for these expenses.&#13;
All disbursements would be fully documented except for contracts for goods&#13;
valued at less than US$25,000 and for consulting services valued at less than&#13;
US$50,000 for individual consultants and US$100,000 for consultants' firms&#13;
and for operating costs for which disbursements would be made against&#13;
statements of expenditures (SOEs) for which the supporting documentation&#13;
would be retained by MoPaD and the EMA, and would be made available to&#13;
authorized auditors and Bank supervision missions. Retroactive financing of&#13;
up to US$0.4 million would be provided for eligible project expenditures&#13;
(made after July 1, 1994). The project is expected to be completed by June&#13;
30, 1999 and to close by December 31, 1999.&#13;

c Bank guidelines would apply&#13;
40.   To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower has agreed to&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, a Special Account (SA) with the Central Bank. The authorized&#13;
allocation would be US$400,000 (representing four months' average projected&#13;
expenditures). The SA would be replenished at three monthly intervals. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
documentation requirements for replenishment of the SA would follow&#13;
procedures described in paragraph 39. In addition, monthly bank statements&#13;
of the SA, which have been reconciled by the Borrower, would accompany all&#13;
replenishment requests.&#13;
41.   Accounting and Auditing. To account for project costs and financing,&#13;
MoPaD and the EMA would establish procedures to consolidate project&#13;
accounts before the transfer of implementation responsibilities. The EMA&#13;
will establish separate accounts to record eligible project expenditures made on&#13;
behalf of the Participating Agencies. Such procedures would be adequate to&#13;
account for and monitor the financial operations of the project. The project&#13;
accounts, SA and related financial information (including supporting&#13;
documentation for SOEs), would be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank in accordance with Bank auditing guidelines.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that certified copies of the&#13;
audited consolidated project accounts and audited SA (including a separate&#13;
opinion on the use of the SOEs) would be submitted annually to the Bank not&#13;
later than four months after the close of the financial year, starting with the&#13;
audit reports for the financial year ending December 31, 1995 (para. 42&#13;
(b)(xii)).&#13;

Mr. Shahid Javed Burki&#13;
Vice President&#13;
Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
1818, H. Street, N. W.&#13;
Washington, D. C. 20433&#13;
U.S.A.&#13;
Dear Mr. Burki,&#13;
NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is seeking the support of the World Bank for its&#13;
efforts to strengthen the legal, regulatory and institutional framework for national environmental&#13;
management and to develop the required institutional capacity to operate the new system effectively.&#13;
2.    The Government considers the programme as being of very high priority. This strong&#13;
commitment reflects, first of all, our concern to put in place an environmental management regime&#13;
and supporting systems which will ensure that as we continue to develop the country, the growth that&#13;
takes place is sustainable and consistent with the need for resource conservation and environmental&#13;
preservation. Additionally, we wish to deal effectively with some of the problems that have arisen&#13;
from improper environmental management. These include forest destruction (especially in the&#13;
Northern Range); river pollution; irresponsible quarrying of limestone, gravel and sand; water&#13;
pollution, particularly in the west coast; soil pollution resulting from indiscriminate use of agricultural&#13;
chemicals; and improper disposal of liquid and solid wastes.&#13;
3.    The present administration has deliberately put environmental management high on its policy&#13;
agenda. In 1992, shortly after taking office, the Government reviewed the existing legal and&#13;
institutional framework for environmental management. The review revealed serious weaknesses in&#13;
the legal and institutional framework, including the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                         ANNEX B&#13;
a)    a proliferation of agencies involved, in one way or other, with environmental management&#13;
issues;&#13;
b)    a lack of formalized mechanisms for co-ordination;&#13;
c)    the fragmentation of legislative instruments, giving rise to jurisdictional difficulties and&#13;
contributing to complexity and ineffectiveness in enforcement action, and&#13;
d)    gaps in coverage (e.g. noise and air pollution).&#13;
New Le2islation&#13;
4.    The review was followed by preparation of a policy brief to be used in developing a new&#13;
legislative and institutional framework. The policy brief was approved by Cabinet in 1993. Cabinet&#13;
also approved the adoption of the following mission statement:&#13;
The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is committed to the concept of sustainable&#13;
development which is an approach to progress that meets the needs of the present&#13;
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.&#13;
Consequently, the Government shall make provision for the establishment and&#13;
operation of an environmental management agency for the formulation and execution&#13;
of national environmental policies and practices, for the promotion of public&#13;
awareness of environmental concerns, and for the establishment of an effective&#13;
regulatory regime which will improve, protect and conserve the natural and cultural&#13;
heritage of the country and avoid environmental damage and degradation of natural&#13;
resources and secure sustainable development.&#13;
Against that background, new legislation was drafted during 1994 with the assistance of a legal&#13;
consultant whose services were made available through the United Nations Development Programme&#13;
(UNDP) and UNEP. As a matter of deliberate policy, the Government has placed a great deal of&#13;
emphasis on securing full public participation in the process of evolving the new legislative and&#13;
institutional framework. Accordingly, the Environrmental Management Bill was published for public&#13;
review and comment during August/September 1994. There was strong public interest and the&#13;
responses were generally constructive and incisive. Following consideration of the comments&#13;
received, several amendments were made to the draft legislation. The revised Bill was approved by&#13;
Cabinet on December 15, 1994 and tabled in Parliament on December 20, 1994. Debate on the Bill&#13;
commenced on January 10, 1995 and the legislation is expected to be approved by February 28, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37                         ANNEX B&#13;
Environmental Management Authority&#13;
5.    Key features of the new legislation include the establishment of an Environmental&#13;
Management Authority, an Environmental Trust Fund and an Environmental Commission.&#13;
The broad functions of the Authority are to --&#13;
(a)    make recommendations for a National Environmental Policy;&#13;
(b)    develop and implement policies and programmes for the effective management and&#13;
wise use of the environment, consistent with the objects of the Act;&#13;
(c)    co-ordinate environmental management functions performed by persons in Trinidad&#13;
and Tobago;&#13;
(d)   make recommendations for the rationalisation of all governmental entities performing&#13;
environmental functions;&#13;
(e)    promote educational and public awareness programmes on the environment;&#13;
(f)    develop and establish national environmental standards and criteria;&#13;
(g)   monitor compliance with the standards, criteria and programmes relating to the&#13;
environment"&#13;
(h)   take all appropriate actions for the prevention and control of pollution and&#13;
conservation of the environment; and&#13;
(i)    establish and co-ordinate institutional linkages locally, regionally and internationally.&#13;
6.    The enabling legislation will give the Authority adequate powers to be an effective instrument&#13;
for the promotion of sound environmental practices. The specific powers include, for example, the&#13;
ability to:&#13;
(a)    establish procedures for the registration of sources from which pollutants may be&#13;
released into the environment and the characterization of such sources;&#13;
(b)   specify the quantity, condition or concentration of pollutants or substances containing&#13;
pollutants that may be released into the environment,&#13;
(c)   set out procedures and standards with respect to permits or licences required for a&#13;
person to install or operate any process or other source from which pollutants may&#13;
be released into the environment;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                          ANNEX B&#13;
(d)    establish procedures and standards for the formal designation and protection of&#13;
"environmentally sensitive areas" or "environmentally sensitive species";&#13;
(e)   introduce incentive programmes or mechanisms which encourage the use of effective&#13;
environmental systems and the achievement of improvements in environmental&#13;
quality,&#13;
(f)    designate hazardous substances or categories of hazardous substances, and the&#13;
performance standards, procedures, safeguards and licensing or permitting&#13;
requirements in accordance with which such hazardous substances shall be handled;&#13;
(g)    establish procedures to be followed by anyone required to apply for a certificate of&#13;
environmental clearance, and the standards for preparation and submission of&#13;
environmental impact assessment;&#13;
(h)    define various categories of waste and the requirements with respect to the handling&#13;
and disposal of such waste, as well as license facilities at which such wastes are to be&#13;
handled or disposed;&#13;
(i)    establish procedures and standards for the monitoring of pollutant releases from any&#13;
process, activity, vehicle or premises;&#13;
(j)    declare ambient environmental quality criteria and standards; and&#13;
(k)    approve the design, construction, operation, maintenance and monitoring of facilities&#13;
or processes for the control of pollution and the handling of wastes.&#13;
7.    It is of significance that the legislation provides that the Authority " .... shall facilitate co-&#13;
operation among persons and manage the environment in a manner which fosters participation and&#13;
promotes consensus, including the encouragement and use of appropriate means to avoid or&#13;
expeditiously resolve disputes through mechanisms for alternative dispute resolution." This reflects&#13;
our conviction that the Authority must not be unduly confrontational or anti-development and that&#13;
it should seek to engender co-operation, promote awareness and encourage voluntary compliance&#13;
as key strategies in the pursuit of national environmental management objectives.&#13;
8.    At the same time, the Authority will be afforded a considerable degree of operating autonomy.&#13;
It will be set up as a statutory body, governed by a I l-person Board of Directors appointed by the&#13;
President of the Republic on the advice of the Cabinet. The Board will be accountable to the Minister&#13;
responsible for Environmental Matters who will give general policy directions to the Authority. The&#13;
composition of the Board will be multidisciplinary and members will be drawn from a wide cross-&#13;
section of disciplines and groups, including: environmental management, ecology, environmental&#13;
health, engineering, labour, community-based  organizations, business, economics, public&#13;
administration, law, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The Authority will also be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39                         ANNEX B&#13;
permitted to set up committees, working groups or advisory councils to assist in carrying out its&#13;
functions. These devices will allow for wide involvement and mobilization of the national community.&#13;
Environmental Trust Fund&#13;
9.    The new legislation also establishes an Environmental Trust Fund which will be used to fund&#13;
the operations of the Authority and to promote national environmental management objectives. The&#13;
activities to be supported by the Trust Fund include:&#13;
(a)   incentive measures for reducing environmental pollution, protecting the environment&#13;
and conserving natural resources;&#13;
(b)    demonstration projects of innovative technologies which reduce pollution, or which&#13;
reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous substances or the generation of wastes;&#13;
(c)    emergency response activities to address actual or potential threats to human health&#13;
or the environment, including remediation or restoration of environmentally degraded&#13;
sites, containment of any wastes, hazardous substances or other environmentally&#13;
dangerous conditions, or other appropriate precautionary measures to prevent&#13;
significant adverse effects on human health or the environment; and&#13;
(d)   public awareness and education programmes to enhance the understanding of the&#13;
environmental protection and natural resources management issues within Trinidad&#13;
and Tobago.&#13;
10.   The legislation specifically requires the Authority to prepare recommendations for a&#13;
comprehensive National Environmental Policy (NEP). The Authority's recommendations must be&#13;
based on an analysis of the prevailing state of the environment, targeted environmental quality&#13;
norms, ecological and other balances required to conserve natural resources and protect the&#13;
environment and consideration of areas of the environment requiring special protection. It is&#13;
obligatory for the Authority to complete its initial recommendations not later than two years after the&#13;
Act takes effect. The NEP must also include:&#13;
(a)    provisions to encourage the establishment of institutional linkages locally, regionally&#13;
and internationally to further the objectives of the Act;&#13;
(b)    analyses of factors impacting upon the development and successful implementation&#13;
of national environmental policy; and&#13;
(c)    a programme for promoting the policy and building national commitment.&#13;
Provision is made to facilitate public comment on the policy proposals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                          ANNEX B&#13;
Rationalisation Activitv&#13;
11.   The Government is convinced that given the inherent constraints the process of strengthening&#13;
and rationalizing the national environmental management framework must be evolutionary. The&#13;
programme envisages that the Authority will commence a series of Rationalization Studies not later&#13;
than six months after it commences operations. The studies will each focus on a particular sub-set&#13;
of the national environmental management system, either in relation to a priority functional area or&#13;
a cluster of institutions. The primary objective of the study will be to develop specific&#13;
recommendations to rationalize the sub-system and enhance capacity and performance. This may&#13;
include any or all of the following options:&#13;
(a)    merger of existing institutions to improve effectiveness and better utilise scarce&#13;
resources;&#13;
(b)    consolidation, rationalisation and modernisation of legislation;&#13;
(c)    elimination of duplication of programmes or activities;&#13;
(d)    strengthening of an existing institution; and&#13;
(e)    accessing services from private providers as an alternative to continuing or expanding&#13;
the services of an existing agency.&#13;
12.   The second and subsequent phases of this programme will be characterised by the&#13;
implementation of recommendations generated by the completed studies and the mounting of&#13;
additional rationalisation studies.&#13;
Operatine Mechanisms&#13;
13.   The EMA will use the instrument of delegation to enhance the effectiveness of existina&#13;
agencies involved in environmental management. Through delegation these agencies will be permitted&#13;
to exercise some of the powers of the Authority in furtherance of the objectives of the legislation.&#13;
Thus, the Authority will be required, within three months of the Act coming into effect, to initiate&#13;
consultation with these agencies to establish mechanisms for co-ordination, implementation of&#13;
integrated environmental management programmes, the drawing up of memoranda of understanding,&#13;
and the designation of Environmental Officers.&#13;
14.   The Government also regards the attainment of cost-effectiveness as an important goal of the&#13;
programme. This is reflected in the aspect of programme design related to the Authority itself We&#13;
have avoided a monolithic organisational structure. The Authority will be required to maintain a lean&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41                         ANNEX B&#13;
operation and to contract various services from other government agencies or private sector providers&#13;
in order to get many of its tasks done without the necessity to include such resources within its staff&#13;
complement. Examples of this are laboratory services and field operatives.&#13;
15.   The Government is determined to make the Authority fully operational and effective as early&#13;
as possible. To this end, the Ministry of Planning and Development will shortly award a contract for&#13;
the development, inter alia, of a core set of environmental standards. The programme for which we&#13;
are seeking loan resources from the World Bank also provides for the preparation of a National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) and the commissioning of a needs assessment study with respect&#13;
to a National Environmental Information System.&#13;
16.   Cabinet has also agreed in principle to the establishment of an Environmental Task Force&#13;
which will effectively be the core of the proposed Board of the Authority. The Task Force will plan&#13;
for the commencement of operations of the Authority. Its responsibilities will also include the search&#13;
for a Chief Executive Officer and other key executive staff, and the drawing up of terms of reference&#13;
for specialist services to be provided by consultants on a short-term basis.&#13;
17.   Government is committed to implement the programme in accordance with the Action Plan&#13;
appended.&#13;
Financin2 Arran2ements&#13;
18.   It is recognized that in the short- to medium-term, the establishment of the EMA will increase&#13;
the need for resources to cover start-up and operating expenses, without the benefit of economies&#13;
that are likely to accrue from institutional rationalisation. As regards 1995, the sum of TT$4.4 million&#13;
has been budgeted to assist in programme implementation (this includes $3.5 million of grant&#13;
resources to be provided by the UNDP). Additionally, the budget assumes that TT$1.6 million will&#13;
be available from this World Bank operation. Counterpart funds will be provided for successive years&#13;
of the project as identified in the project financing plan. Moreover, the Government is firmly&#13;
committed to the long term sustainability of the overall programme for the strengthening of national&#13;
environmental management and will continue to provide adequate funding for its success after the&#13;
period of World Bank support comes to an end.&#13;
19.   It should be noted that the Government's counterpart contribution to the financing of the&#13;
environmental management programme will include the salaries and other operating expenses of the&#13;
designated Environmental Officers, having regard to the intention to use that device as a means of&#13;
institutional strengthening and the improvement of cooperation and coordination.&#13;
20.   Appropriations budgeted annually and approved by Parliament will be transferred to the Trust&#13;
Fund to help defray the operating and capital expenses of the Authority. These resources will be&#13;
augmented by income generated by payments for services rendered by the Authority, fees for permits,&#13;
licences, etc. Also going into the Trust Fund will be resources mobilised from multilateral and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                           ANNEX B&#13;
bilateral donors, international foundations, the domestic private sector, etc. Over time, these sources&#13;
are expected to increase substantially the degree of self-reliance of the Authority.&#13;
21.   By way of additional support to facilitate the operations of the EMA, the legislation provides&#13;
that the Authority shall be exempted from stamp duty, corporation tax, customs duties, value added&#13;
taxes, motor vehicle taxes, fees, charges, assessments, levies and imposts on any income or profits&#13;
or on assets which are acquired for use by the Fund or the Authority.&#13;
22.   The Government is confident that the programme outlined herein will be effective in&#13;
promoting and sustaining sound environmental management in Trinidad and Tobago. We appreciate&#13;
the proposed support of the World Bank in its implementation.&#13;
Yours sincerely,&#13;

Brief Description: This project will assist ;n the establishment of the Environmental Management Agency of Trinidad and Tobago&#13;
(EMA) through the provision of technical advisory services and equipment. Specific technical studies will be carried out and legal&#13;
advice will be provided, crucial to the policy direction of the EMA. Legislation to establish the EMA is to be tabled in Parliament&#13;
in June 1994. The overall effort to set up the EMA is being supported by capacity building initiatives financed through the&#13;
Capacity 21 Fund (US$1 50,000). In addition, a World Bank loan is currently under negotiation to support the operational phase&#13;
of the EMA. Under an existing 'Business Expansion and Industrial Restructuring Loan, related tasks will be undertaken such as&#13;
training in 'best practice' Environmental Impact Assessments. Specifically, the following tasks will be addressed:&#13;
(i)     The recruitment process of the Chief Executive Officer, and the Executive Management Team of the EMA;&#13;
(ii)    The structuring of the EMA as a coordinating, regulatory and management agency, and its operationalization;&#13;
liii)   Development of the planning, legal, enforcement and technical capacities required for the EMA;&#13;
(ivI    Development of a medium-term financing plan for the EMA.&#13;
Iv)     Identification and mobilization of additional domestic and financial resources for the EMA and environmental projects&#13;
generally and to recommend optimum coordination for the effective use of domestic and external project resources.&#13;

Dear Mr. Wholey,&#13;
Environmental ivlanasement Authoritv -&#13;
Access to Government's CounterRart Contribution&#13;
''su5m of TT56.0 million is allocated in the 1995 capital budget of the Ministry of&#13;
Plannina and Development for tle Establishment of the Envirow-nental Management Authority&#13;
Lcluded in this amount is Government's counterpart contribution of S900,000 which will be&#13;
sourced from the Consolidated Fund.&#13;
2.    As a matter of policy, priority is given by the Ministry of Finance to disbursing funds&#13;
which represent counterpart contributions under the capital programrne. Funds will be made&#13;
available from the Consolidated Fund to the Permanent Secre:ary Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Development for the establishment of the Environmental Management Authority at quarterly&#13;
intervals.  The amounts disbursed will be based on the expenditure requirements of the&#13;
Environmental Management Authority for the quarter.&#13;
3.    The procedure for accessing the funds will be as follow-::&#13;
(i)   the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Planning and Development submits a request&#13;
for the release of the amount required to the Budget Division of the Ministry of&#13;
Finance. The request must be accompanied by a status report on expenditures&#13;
made against any previous releases for the fiscal year, as well as information on&#13;
the projected activities and expenditure for which the release is sought. Approval&#13;
of the request is granted unless the information submitted is inadequate or&#13;
expenditure data is inconsistent with the findings of the Budget Division in&#13;
monitoring the project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                          ANNEX E&#13;
(ii)   the Budget Division advises the Permanent Secretarv, NMinistry of Planningn and&#13;
Development of its approval of the release of funds, upon which the Permanent&#13;
Secretary, Minis.ry of Plannin2 and Development seeks a grant of credit from the&#13;
Comptroller of Accounts to spend the released funds.  The grant of credit is&#13;
approved immediately, except in the circumstances where the Treasurv's cash flow&#13;
situation requires that the approval be temporarily deferred,&#13;
(iii)   when the Comptroller of Accounts approves the grant of credit, the Permanent&#13;
Secretary, Ministry of Planning and Development is authorised to issue cheques&#13;
for payment of goods and services up to the amount approved;&#13;
(iv)   when the Environmental Management Authority is established, the Permanent&#13;
Secretary, MOinistry of Planning and Development may issue a cheque in the&#13;
amount released to the Authority, which cheque may be lodged in a Central Bank&#13;
or Commercial Bank account opened in the name of the Authority.&#13;
4.    The counterpart contribution discussed here does not include salaries and other benefits&#13;
paid to officers of NMinistries and agencies who are responsible for carrying out environmental&#13;
functions. These officers will continue to be paid by their respective Mvinistries and agencies.&#13;
5.    I trust that this letter adecuately clarifies for the Bank the procedures that will be followed&#13;
for accessing Government's counterpart contribution to the project.&#13;
Yours sincerely,&#13;
V Permanent Secretary,&#13;

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
TRAINING AND TRAINING-RELATED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
Objectives and Description&#13;
1.    The purpose of training and training-related technical assistance&#13;
provided under the project is to: (a) provide general environmental&#13;
sensitization of the staff of MoPaD and the EMA, the Participating Agencies,&#13;
other government agencies and the "public" at large; (b) improve technical and&#13;
managerial capabilities of staff of the EMA and the Participating Agencies;&#13;
and (c) strengthen the environmental network, locally and internationally.&#13;
2.    The training philosophy for the proposed agency would be developed as&#13;
part of the terms of reference of a Training Adviser (Attachment 1), provided&#13;
through training-related technical assistance under the project. It is envisaged&#13;
that the training philosophy would encompass: (a) creating a "knowledge-&#13;
based" agency with strong "hands-on" skills; and (b) devoting a large amount&#13;
of time to "on-the-job" training, emphasizing "learning by doing". Time&#13;
allocations away from the agency for training should not exceed 10-15 percent.&#13;
3.    Training and training-related technical assistance will support the three&#13;
components of the project: (a) MoPaD, through training programs and&#13;
workshops for Consensus Building of Stakeholders and Public&#13;
Education/Awareness; (b) the EMA, through provision of technical assistance&#13;
and training for staff in the agency, the provision of a specialized training&#13;
facility, a mobile "public awareness" vehicle, and other equipment. Much of&#13;
the training requirements under this component would be driven by the&#13;
findings of the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP). Therefore,&#13;
specific training programs will be prioritized once the NEAP has been&#13;
developed. Meanwhile, the following generic programs are provided to use as&#13;
a guide in developing such training programs; and (c) the Participating&#13;
Agencies, as part of institutional strengthening training would be provided for&#13;
the Environmental Officers and other staff of such agencies.&#13;
Training for MoPaD.&#13;
4.    This would include the following activities (to be financed by UNDP):&#13;
(a) Consensus Building of Stakeholders, involving consultations with&#13;
representatives from Parliament, Business, Labor, NGO's, Community Based&#13;
Organizations and other stakeholders, with the objective of forging a national&#13;
consensus in support of the proposed new agency; (b) an Inter-Ministerial&#13;
consultation comprising Ministers responsible for the 28 agencies with&#13;
environmental management functions, with the objective of concluding an&#13;
interim Memorandum of Understanding among the Ministers to formalize the&#13;
coordination role of the EMA (as a preliminary to the rationalization&#13;
exercises); (c) preparation and implementation of a Public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68                        ANNEX G&#13;
Education/Awareness Program to sensitize the national community on critical&#13;
environmental issues facing the country and the need for effective&#13;
environmental management; and (d) Seminars/Workshops on the role and&#13;
functions of the EMA and Participating Agencies. These events would invite&#13;
participation from NGO's, business and labor organizations, professional&#13;
associations, community groups, and the 28 environmental agencies&#13;
participating in the project. The objective would be to provide information on&#13;
the operationalization of the environmental management agency and to&#13;
consider and recommend participating mechanisms for the national community&#13;
in the management of the environment.&#13;
Training for the Environmental Management Authority&#13;
5.    A full-time staff Training and Education Officer (Attachment 2 -&#13;
Terms of Reference) would be located in the Information and Education Unit&#13;
of the EMA (base cost allocation US$109,000). Apart from ensuring&#13;
operationalization of the training program for EMA staff, this officer would be&#13;
responsible for coordinating training-related technical assistance for&#13;
development of: (a) a formal environmental training curriculum (including&#13;
training for teachers at the primary/secondary school levels, education&#13;
materials -- e.g. information kits on conservation) - base cost allocation&#13;
US$110,000; (b) non-formal environmental education (including continuing&#13;
education programs through the University of the West Indies (UWI),&#13;
churches, and NGO's) - base cost allocation US$100,000; and (c) a public&#13;
awareness campaign, utilizing where possible, the knowledge and experience&#13;
of existing NGOs - base cost allocation US$138,000.&#13;
Training for the Participating Agencies&#13;
6.    The project would provide training for the environmental officers and&#13;
other key staff in the Participating Agencies. This training, would essentially&#13;
be driven by the findings of the Institutional Rationalization Studies, and&#13;
therefore, it is not possible to specify details of the training program until&#13;
these studies have been completed. A first step, however, would be a "needs&#13;
assessment" to identify the training needs of individual staff. It is likely that a&#13;
series of core courses would be organized, on such topics as basic&#13;
environmental assessment, institutional policy making, and introduction to&#13;
the economics of enviromnental management. Based on the outcome of the&#13;
"needs assessment", more specialized training would be provided, broadly&#13;
covering monitoring and enforcement; green (renewable natural resources)&#13;
and brown (industrial pollution and waste management) issues. Attachment 3&#13;
(below) provides generic training modules which could be used as a guide in&#13;
developing the specialized training. Total base cost allocation for such training&#13;
is US$175,000, to be financed out of loan funds.&#13;
7.    Training-Related Tlchnical Assistance. Technical assistance will be&#13;
provided under the project for a Training Adviser (see para. 2) to undertake a&#13;
Training Design Study which will include development of: (a) a training&#13;
program for EMA staff and environmental officers and staff in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
69                         ANNEX G&#13;
Participating Agencies (based on the outcome of a "needs assessment" of such&#13;
staff), and incorporating core courses as mentioned above; (b) university and&#13;
other more general environmental programs; and (c) a training philosophy for&#13;
the EMA. Such technical assistance would be for six months, commencing on&#13;
start up of the new agency and would cover six months full time local training&#13;
adviser and two months foreign training adviser - base cost allocation&#13;
US$70,000.&#13;
8.    Traininlg. The project would provide:&#13;
(a)    Technical and Training Advisers (External) to provide staff of&#13;
the EMA with "on-the-job" training in specialized areas as follows:&#13;
(i) 18 months for the Officers of the Control and Compliance Unit, comprising&#13;
three months for standards development in each of the following areas;&#13;
environmental impact and assessment guidelines, pollution standards,&#13;
laboratory QA/QC standards, remediation/reclamation standards, public&#13;
participation guidelines, and environmental audit; and (ii) 13 months of&#13;
technical expertise on noise, air, water pollution; toxic and hazardous&#13;
substances; solid waste pollution; conservation; coastal zone management; and&#13;
renevwable/mineral resources (total 31 person months training resource at&#13;
US$20,000 p/m, total base cost allocation US$620,000);&#13;
(b)   Training Program for the EMA and Environmental Officers&#13;
in the Participating Agencies would be driven by the results of the Training&#13;
Design Study (para. 7) and would likely comprise a mixture of:&#13;
(i) short term local training, in the form of specialized short courses and&#13;
seminars to be held in Trinidad and Tobago. Such training would be&#13;
scheduled throughout the project and would ideally be delivered on a contract&#13;
basis by UWI, and/or consultancy firms; (ii) short term overseas training, in&#13;
the form of specialized short courses, study tours and seminars. Study-leave&#13;
periods would extend to a maximum of about two months per year; and&#13;
(iii) long term training - local or overseas, in the form of programs of one&#13;
year or longer, supported by scholarships financed by the project. This&#13;
training, which is likely to take place in the latter part of project&#13;
implementation, would not be limited to staff of the EMA to take account of&#13;
possible attrition. A possible alternative would be for trainees to work as&#13;
interns with foreign or local companies to learn and practice highly specialized&#13;
environmental concepts, techniques, process or skills in an actual job setting.&#13;
Suggested training courses for Environmental Officers include: integrated&#13;
environmental management demonstrating inter-relationship between all&#13;
development priorities and environmental management; general environmental&#13;
management practices; national environmental legislation; community&#13;
development and intersectoral collaboration for environmental management;&#13;
and the use of environmental management information systems and, in&#13;
particular, NEMIS. Attachment 4 provides some generic modules which&#13;
could be used as a guide for developing the training program for&#13;
Environmental Officers. (Total base cost allocation US$300,000).&#13;

9.    Training Facility. A key objective of training and training-related&#13;
technical assistance to be provided under the proposed project is to strengthen&#13;
environmental network capacities. To facilitate such networking, the project&#13;
would finance a centralized classroom facility (est. 300 sq ft) within the EMA&#13;
headquarters and audio visual equipment, and specialized training equipment&#13;
such as soil test kits (base cost allocation US$50,000). The proposed project&#13;
would also finance the purchase of a mobile "public awareness" vehicle (base&#13;
cost allocation US$26,000).&#13;
10.   Total project base cost allocation for training and training-related&#13;
technical assistance to be provided under the project is US$1,898,000 (of&#13;
which US$100,000 would be financed by UNDP). A Summary Matrix of&#13;
training and training-related technical assistance is included as Attachment 5.&#13;

SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STAFF&#13;
GENERIC TRAINING MODULES&#13;
Subject: Environmental Auditing&#13;
Environmental Auditing is one method through which pollution can be&#13;
reduced/prevented (waste minimization) as a result of comparatively low cost&#13;
changes, or even high cost improvements with short payback periods.&#13;
Environmental Auditing in general is not a well known or understood concept&#13;
in Trinidad and Tobago, nor do there appear to be persons with the requisite&#13;
skills to undertake such tasks. The objective of the training is consequently&#13;
two-fold; to increase the awareness of the benefits that can accrue from&#13;
environmental audits (sensitization); and to train professionals to undertake&#13;
such audits. The basic activities involved in such training are:&#13;
*     Identification by the EMA of 10 professionals to be trained in&#13;
environmental auditing and three companies, representing&#13;
different manufacturing sectors, willing to permit the consultant&#13;
providing the training and the trainees to perform an&#13;
environmental audit of their facilities.&#13;
-     A training workshop on environmental auditing for the selected&#13;
trainees, consisting of a two days course on general principals,&#13;
and three days each devoted to sector specific topics, to be&#13;
presented by international experts.&#13;
*     The ten trainees would undertake audits of each of the three&#13;
selected industrial facilities under the supervision and guidance&#13;
of the international experts. A maximum of three days per audit&#13;
would be allowed. The companies would be required to provide&#13;
data including water and energy consumption and quantities of&#13;
wastes arising from their industrial process. (All information&#13;
provided would be treated in the strictest confidence within an&#13;
understanding that no results would be made public).&#13;
*     Full confidential audit reports would be prepared under the&#13;
supervision of the international experts. The reports would&#13;
emphasize opportunities for improvements in reductions in air&#13;
emissions, liquid effluent, waste, and water and energy&#13;
consumption. The reports, which would highlight, where&#13;
possible, no-cost and low-cost improvements would be presented&#13;
to, and discussed with, the managers of the participating&#13;
companies. Four weeks should be allocated for this exercise.&#13;
*     Finally, an environmental audit manual would be prepared&#13;
which would be generic in nature, but based on the experiences&#13;
gained in the exercises described in the last paragraph. The&#13;

manual would be used as centerpiece in a two-day general&#13;
training workshop for 30 people, to describe the methods used&#13;
and to emphasize the potential benefits of such audits.&#13;
Participants would be mainly, but not exclusively, drawn from&#13;
industry, the EMA, and the Participating Agencies. Speakers&#13;
might include managers from the companies participating in the&#13;
trial audits, and from other companies which may have had&#13;
environmental audits performed by private contractors.&#13;

National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP)&#13;
Background: A significant amount of work has been done within Trinidad&#13;
and Tobago to describe various environmental problems and identify potential&#13;
methods for addressing these problems. Human and financial resource&#13;
constraints, however, require that systematic priorities be set for addressing&#13;
the problems, and that a broad consensus be established including the&#13;
appropriate institutional and policy interventions. Experience elsewhere has&#13;
indicated that such priority-setting and consensus-building can be addressed&#13;
effectively within a national environmental planning process the output of&#13;
which is referred to as the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).&#13;
Purpose: The primary objective of this exercise is to establish, within a&#13;
consistent framework, the substantial technical environmental priorities within&#13;
Trinidad and Tobago. These problems might include, for example, land&#13;
degradation (soil erosion, soil productivity decline, toxic waste pollution, solid&#13;
waste disposal), water resource degradation (water pollution, groundwater&#13;
abstraction, marine contamination), renewal resource degradation (fisheries&#13;
decline, deforestation), or air and noise pollution. Establishment of these&#13;
relative priorities will assist in the staffing of the EMA and in the conduct of&#13;
specific interventions (institutional, policy, education, project investments). A&#13;
second objective of the project is to undertake this analysis with substantial and&#13;
broad input from all stakeholders to insure that some consensus is achieved&#13;
regarding appropriate interventions.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROPOSED STUDIES - DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE13&#13;
Institutional Rationalization Studies&#13;
Background: Trinidad and Tobago currently has 28 organizations involved to&#13;
some degree with environmental management. It is recognized that there is&#13;
substantial duplication and overlapping of mandates. Additionally, some&#13;
environmental management needs are incremental to existing capacity. It is&#13;
foreseen that a major function of the EMA would be to coordinate the&#13;
responsibilities of a network of implementing institutions, rather than to&#13;
assume direct control. To facilitate this coordination, it will also be necessary&#13;
to streamline existing operations and rationalize some of the institutional&#13;
structures to ensure that environmental management is achieved&#13;
cost-effectively.&#13;
In addition, it has been recognized that some of the institutions with&#13;
important roles to play require strengthening before they can assist the EMA&#13;
carry out its mandate. This strengthening may take the form of investments in&#13;
human resources development, (through training or specialized staffing), or&#13;
other improvements (such as analytical facilities or computing equipment).&#13;
A budget of US$550,000 has been allocated for such strengthening within the&#13;
project.&#13;
Purpose: The primary purpose of these studies is to recommend cost-effective&#13;
mechanisms for rationalizing the environmental management mandates of all&#13;
relevant government institutions in Trinidad and Tobago. This rationalization&#13;
should be based on a relatively broad consensus. A secondary purpose is to&#13;
identify specific institutional strengthening requirements (in the form of&#13;
training or investment) in the participating institutions that would play a major&#13;
role in environmental management activities.&#13;
Implementation:    Study I:  Feb 1996; EMA Planning Unit&#13;
Study II: June 1996; EMA Planning Unit&#13;
Study Ill&lt; Sept 1996; EMA Planning Unit&#13;
Approach: Based on the findings and recommendations of the NEAP, priority&#13;
environmental issues will be selected. The first study will focus on the cluster&#13;
of institutions whose responsibilities impinge on the environmental issue&#13;
determined as first priority, e.g. oil pollution of rivers. Subsequent&#13;
rationalization studies would focus on other environmental issues. The studies&#13;
would involve consultations and workshops with affected institutions; research&#13;
of secondary information sources; generation of a report; and, presentation of&#13;
13.   Indicatiw and subject to change.&#13;

findings in a workshop consisting of senior policy-makers and government&#13;
functionaries. Each study would involve two stages -- Stage I would focus on&#13;
defining options and lead up to a workshop involving all stakeholders. The&#13;
second phase would focus on recommending the implementation arrangements.&#13;
Specifically, the tasks would include:&#13;
Stage I&#13;
(a) identify relevant agencies and prepare a "responsibility matrix"&#13;
enumerating the current mandate of each agency, highlighting significant gaps&#13;
or overlaps;&#13;
(b) prepare a series of feasible rationalization 'options' which reflect differing&#13;
degrees of rationalization. These could, for example, include: (i) status quo,&#13;
with relatively few changes; (ii) moderate decentralization, which involves&#13;
moderate changes from the status quo; (iii) moderate centralization, which&#13;
involves substantial transfer of some mandates directly to the EMA; or,&#13;
(iv) full decentralization, which involves complete transfer of all environmental&#13;
mandates to a single authority;&#13;
(c) preparation of a paper describing the above options and highlighting&#13;
current responsibilities;&#13;
(d) consultation with agencies regarding this brief, and facilitation of a&#13;
one-day workshop to discuss the best means for proceeding;&#13;
Stage II&#13;
(e) analysis of the implications of the various scenarios;&#13;
(f) selection of a preferred scenario, involving specific recommendations;&#13;
(g) identification of specific implications for the EMA's mode of operation&#13;
and interaction with Participating Agencies;&#13;
(h) identification of specific training and investment priorities in the related&#13;
agencies, where such agencies require strengthening as a result of the&#13;
rationalization process. This should also include a 10 year investment plan for&#13;
such strengthening; (funding is available within the project for this purpose);&#13;
(i) preparation of a final report summarizing the above; and&#13;
(j) submission of recommendation to Cabinet for approval to implement&#13;
recommendations of report.&#13;

Training Needs and Design Study&#13;
Background: A key goal of the proposed project is to improve the overall&#13;
level of environmental education and awareness in Trinidad and Tobago. The&#13;
project has identified approximately US$1.5 million in specific on-the-job and&#13;
specialized training initiatives that may be implemented over a four year time&#13;
horizon. Objectives for the overall training program are threefold: (a) general&#13;
environmental sensitization for all individuals - including staff of the EMA,&#13;
Environmental Officers and other staff in the Participating Agencies and the&#13;
public at large; (b) specific management and technical training for all staff in&#13;
the EMA and Participating Units; and (c) development of an environmental&#13;
network by providing numerous opportunities for individuals to interact and&#13;
form working groups for information sharing in either a formal or informal&#13;
setting. In addition, the training philosophy should reflect the development of&#13;
a knowledge-based expert institution that focused on active on-the-job training&#13;
while staff were implementing the mandate of the EMA. For example, staff&#13;
should be available to undertake their normal duties at least 85 percent of the&#13;
time, with the remainder potentially dedicated to formal or other training away&#13;
from their normal place of work.&#13;
Purpose: The primary purpose of this exercise is to design in detail a four&#13;
year investment plan that would improve general environmental skills and&#13;
awareness in the country. The investment plan would address the following&#13;
four thematic components: (a) a specialized training program for staff of the&#13;
EMA and the staff of the participating agencies; (b) a public awareness&#13;
campaign; (c) formal curriculum development; and (d) non-formal education&#13;
initiatives. In addition, the study would provide input into: (a) identifying the&#13;
most effective mechanisms for on-the-job training of agency staff by foreign&#13;
advisers; (b) formulating an appropriate job description for the Education and&#13;
Training Officer; and (c) identifying equipment needs for the EMA in the form&#13;
of classroom facilities, audio-visual vehicles, etc.&#13;
Implementation: Commencing July 1995: EMA Education Unit.&#13;
Tasks: The tasks would focus on: research of secondary information sources;&#13;
consultation; analysis of findings; and, generation of a report. Specifically,&#13;
(a) reviewing existing training and education programs with a view to&#13;
identifying resources within GoRTI that may be used or modified for one or&#13;

short term study abroad. Specialized training needs for staff of related&#13;
environmental agencies should also be identified. The work should also&#13;
identify equipment needs for classroom facilities within the proposed agency;&#13;
(f) formulation of a public awareness campaign that will be managed by the&#13;
Information and Education Unit. The campaign should provide a&#13;
recommended monthly activity break-down and a monthly budget appropriate&#13;
for media coverage. The work should also identify equipment requirements;&#13;
for example, this equipment might include a mobile unit with public education&#13;
materials; (g) recommendations for adjusting the formal curriculum of&#13;
primary, secondary, and post-secondary education in Trinidad and Tobago.&#13;
This may include the introduction of specialized environmental training&#13;
modules or classes, or the sensitization of existing curricula to environmental&#13;
issues. The investment plan must identify any incremental training resources&#13;
that will be required to fulfill these recommendations, as well as any&#13;
institutional changes that may be needed to implement them; (h) formulation of&#13;
appropriate interventions and investments for non-formal education channels.&#13;
These should be designed in consultation with NGOs, churches, community&#13;
groups, and other relevant organizations. The plan should identify investment&#13;
requirements for this component over a four year time horizon;&#13;
(i) formulation of a job description for a permanent EMA Training and&#13;

Alternative Mediation Study&#13;
Background: Most of the judicial mechanisms in Trinidad and Tobago are&#13;
currently backlogged with cases. This has prompted the government to look&#13;
into different mechanisms for settling disputes which might relate to&#13;
environmental issues. It is expected that, to some degree, the new&#13;
Environmental Commission will provide one mechanism for dealing with&#13;
disputes that are of a highly contentious nature. It is recognized, however,&#13;
that other complementary mechanisms may be required for less contentious&#13;
cases.&#13;
Purpose: The primary purpose of this exercise is to identify potential&#13;
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms that can improve the overall&#13;
cost-effectiveness of resolving environment-related disputes. These&#13;
mechanisms should be capable of shortening the overall process of dispute&#13;
resolution, and decrease the load on other parts of the country's judiciary.&#13;
Implementation: July 1995; started by MoPaD and to be completed by the&#13;

PPP Incentive Study I&#13;
Background: Economic incentives, based on the polluter pay principle (PPP),&#13;
provide an opportunity for controlling environmental degradation while also&#13;
decreasing the costs of achieving target levels of environmental quality. A&#13;
potential long term role for the EMA is to provide advice relating to the use of&#13;
such instruments and to oversee the efficient implementation of any such&#13;
programs. There is currently very limited use of such instruments and very&#13;
limited awareness of their potential scope for application.&#13;
Purpose: The primary objective of this exercise is to increase the awareness&#13;
of policy-makers regarding the potential use of PPP incentives. A secondary&#13;
objective is to identify areas or sectors in Trinidad and Tobago where the&#13;
application of such incentives may be most beneficial.&#13;

Innovative Finance Mechanism Study&#13;
Background: Most of the polluter-pay types of incentives to be addressed in&#13;
other studies are expected to provide a direct incentive for sound&#13;
environmental management. The revenue impact of many of these incentives&#13;
is minimal. Other mechanisms for financing environmental institutions are,&#13;
however, available, but may have little impact on environmental quality.&#13;
Purpose: The primary purpose is to identify and assess long term options for&#13;
bolstering the financial autonomy of the EMA. A secondary purpose is to&#13;

Natural Resource &amp; Envirommental Accounting (NREA) Study&#13;
Background: There is growing awareness that conventional methods of&#13;
growth accounting - GDP and GNP - do not adequately address issues relating&#13;
to environmental degradation such as the depletion of resource stocks and the&#13;
declining quality of non-marketed environmental goods and services.&#13;
Techniques of Natural Resource and Environmental Accounting have been&#13;
developed, and are currently being implemented by UN countries on an&#13;
experimental basis. These techniques provide an important tool for providing&#13;
policy makers with information that can assist in identifying the most&#13;
cost-effective environmental management interventions.&#13;
Purpose: The primary objective of this study is to identify environmental&#13;
information needs and appropriate environmental accounting methodologies for&#13;
assisting in cost-effective planning. A secondary objective is to generate a&#13;
case study based on existing information that can be used to identify the data&#13;
requirements and to serve as an educational tool for describing the linkages&#13;
between economic activity and environmental quality.&#13;
Implementation: January, 1996; EMA Planning Unit.&#13;
'Isks: The tasks associated with this activity focus on: consultation; research&#13;
of secondary information sources; generation of a report; and, presentation of&#13;
findings in a workshop consisting of senior policy-makers and government&#13;

(a)   review of environmental and economic information sources, and&#13;
consultation with government officials and others associated with&#13;
economic and environmental planning;&#13;
(b)   selection of one or more NREA methodologies that may be&#13;
applied in a case study, and sector(s), region(s) and/or time&#13;
period(s) to which the methodology may be applied;&#13;
(c)   preparation of a case study based on these selections;&#13;

study and outlining the implications and potential applications of&#13;
the work;&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;

Mid-term Evaluation Report&#13;
Background: The Environmental Management Project includes a significant&#13;
number of initiatives that involve establishing, reforming or strengthening&#13;
institutions on the basis of ongoing consultations and studies. Although the&#13;
original project design will accommodate many potential contingencies, a&#13;
formal review of performance, as well as future options, will facilitate&#13;
implementation of the latter phases of the project. This is particularly critical&#13;
because capacity development may well constrain future plans, and some&#13;
mechanism is therefore required to ensure that any implementation bottlenecks&#13;
are addressed effectively. The mid-term review will require that an&#13;
independent arms-length report be prepared for review by the Govemment and&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
Purpose: The report is an integral part of the mid-term review process. The&#13;
mid-term review has the following objectives: (a) monitoring and assessment&#13;
of the implementation phase and of the effectiveness of MoPaD during this&#13;
phase; (b) assessment of the capacity of the EMA and the Participating&#13;
Agencies in fulfilling their environmental management functions; (c) review of&#13;
original work program with a view to identifying implementation bottlenecks&#13;
and appropriate strategic revisions to project design; and (d) review of specific&#13;
work components to assess specific modifications to future project components&#13;
(especially as these relate to training and supplementary institutional&#13;
strengthening.)&#13;
Implementation: not later than June 1997; EMA Planning Unit with input&#13;
from MoPaD.&#13;
lhsks: The tasks associated with this activity focus on: consultation; review&#13;
of all project outputs; and, preparation of recommendations. It will be carried&#13;
out in two phases: Phase I involves a brief delineation of monitoring criteria;&#13;
and, Phase II involves the actual review and assessment. The specific tasks&#13;
include:&#13;
Phase I&#13;
(a)   consultation with the EMA and MoPaD to confirm monitoring&#13;
and review criteria;&#13;

            The objective of the Environmental
            Management Project is to build effective institutional
            capacity to plan and implement sound environmental
            management. Further objectives are to complete a national
            environmental action plan (NEAP), support a priority work
            program which will strengthen the legal and regulatory
            framework, and implement measures for improved environmental
            management consistent with the findings of the NEAP. The
            project will provide for: 1) the purchase of computer
            hardware and software and other office equipment and
            vehichles; 2) about 150 person-months of international and
            local consultants who will prepare a NEAP, provide advice on
            policy, legal and technical matters, and undertake studies
            on priority areas; 3) training workshops, seminars, public
            awareness, curriculum development and environmental
            education; 4) the cost of incremental salaries for staff
            contracted, support for the Environmental Management
            Authority, and the incremental costs associated with support
            of the participating agencies (NGO's, private sector
            agencies, etc.); and 5) operational and overhead materials
            and supplies for the project.
