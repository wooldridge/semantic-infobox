ï»¿ANNEX III&#13;
STANDARD PROVISIONS AGREED BETWEEN THE WORLD BANK AND THE&#13;
DONORS&#13;
NICARAGUA EDUCATION SECTOR STRATEGY MULTI-DONOR TRUST FUND&#13;
(TF071954)&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements&#13;
between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set&#13;
forth in this Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or&#13;
responsibilities to the Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that&#13;
might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary&#13;
law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges&#13;
or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which&#13;
are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively,. the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended&#13;
from time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and&#13;
safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its&#13;
screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line&#13;
with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council&#13;
taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge&#13;
that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist&#13;
financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual&#13;
member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Manaaement of the Contributions&#13;
2.1   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and&#13;
shall be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust&#13;
Fund may be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in&#13;
its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2   The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States&#13;
Dollars (the "Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in&#13;
their respective Administration Agreements.  In the case of deposits received in a&#13;
Contribution Currency other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such&#13;
amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts&#13;
into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for&#13;
providing any additional financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿2.4   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;
the date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5   The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the&#13;
investment of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from&#13;
such investment to the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.    Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1   The Bank may deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for&#13;
the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program&#13;
management and Trust Fund administration, that are: (i) not covered by the percentage&#13;
deduction specified above as an administrative fee; and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the&#13;
Administration Agreements in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures&#13;
shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a maximum of three percent (3%)&#13;
of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3   Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this&#13;
Trust Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If&#13;
actual Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of&#13;
signature of the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust&#13;
Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this&#13;
Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new&#13;
Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration&#13;
Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.    Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1   The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
4.2   The Bank shall furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via&#13;

the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;

the Bank's external auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based&#13;
financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial&#13;
&#13;

4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by&#13;
the Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to&#13;
whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the&#13;
appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope&#13;
and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such&#13;
audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the&#13;
requesting Donor.&#13;

agree on the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all&#13;
relevant information within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All&#13;
associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is&#13;
understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or&#13;
other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.    Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the&#13;
Bank by August 28, 2016 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse&#13;

amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all the Donors. Following the End&#13;
Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each&#13;

of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of&#13;
such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return to the relevant Donor or&#13;
Donors in the Holding Currency in the manner specified by each such Donor in its respective&#13;
Administration Agreement the pro rata share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the Trust&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

such Donor.&#13;
