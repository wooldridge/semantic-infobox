Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation&#13;
in Cambodia&#13;
Turning Finance into&#13;
Services for the Future&#13;
&amp;#12;This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies and&#13;
organisations in Cambodia. A core team drawn from the Ministry of Rural Development (Department of Rural Health Care,&#13;
Department of Rural Water Supply and Department of Planning and Public Relations), and the Ministry of Industry and&#13;
Handicraft, as well as the Ministry of Public Works and Transport have been key partners with the Water and Sanitation Pro-&#13;
gram (WSP) of the World Bank in analyzing the sector. The authors acknowledge the valuable contributions made by these&#13;
organizations, as well as other sector stakeholders, including development partners and NGOs partners in the sector that&#13;
participated in the workshops and have shared their information, such as UNICEF, ADB, JICA, UN-Habitat, SNV, and others.&#13;
&#13;
The Task Team Leader for the Regional Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) in East Asia and Pacific is Susanna Smets. The&#13;
following World Bank staff and consultants have provided valuable contributions to the Service Delivery Assessment pro-&#13;
cess and report for Cambodia: Phyrum Kov, Sopheap Ly, Virak Chan, Kuysrorn Seng, Sandra Giltner and Almud Weitz. This&#13;
report was peer reviewed by World Bank staff Lixin Gu and Claire Grisaffi, as well as Belinda Abraham from UNICEF.&#13;
&#13;
The report also has benefited greatly from the Cambodia Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Review completed in 2013,&#13;
which was led by World Bank staff Lixin Gu.&#13;
&#13;
The SDA was carried out under the guidance of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s WaÂ­  ter and Sanitation Program and local partners. This re-&#13;
gional work, implemented through a country-led process, draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs conductÂ­ ed in&#13;
more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
An SDA analysis has three main components: a review of past water and sanitation access, a costing model to asÂ­       sess the ad-&#13;
equacy of future investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service deÂ­   livery pathways. SDAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector targets for infrastructure&#13;
and hardware but also what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure that fiÂ­   nance is effectively turned into accelerated&#13;
and sustainable water supply and sanitation service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership, part of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Water Global Practice, sup-&#13;
porting poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s donors&#13;
include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nor-&#13;
way, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank.&#13;

&#13;
Against a backdrop of strong economic growth and increas-                       tween the poorest and better-off groups of society remain&#13;

has made considerable progress to help people gain access                       rural population only 12% has access to improved sanitation,&#13;
to improved water and sanitation services, most notably in                      while in the richest rural quintile this is five times as much at&#13;
urban areas, where around one fifth of the population lives.                    59%. In urban areas, with overall good levels of improved&#13;
As of 2012, according to Joint Monitoring Program (JMP)                         access, 86% of the population in the richest quintile enjoys&#13;
data, access to improved water supply in Cambodia reached                       piped water supply services, as compared to 34% for the&#13;
71%, up from 42% in 2000 and already having met the Mil-                        poorest quintile, while overall levels of service in rural areas&#13;

tion, improved access increased from 16% in 2000 to 37% in&#13;
2012, however, remains not on track to meet the MDG target                      Over the past decade, government has initiated a&#13;

The Royal Government of Cambodia has adopted alternative                        of government are not yet clearly defined, accountability&#13;
national goals, known as the Cambodian MDGs, with 2015                          systems are unclear and the real empowerment of citizens&#13;
targets set for each subsector. In the case of rural sanitation                 has not, so far, become a reality.4 The endorsement of the&#13;

probably be met as rural access was estimated to be 25%                         its consequent implementation plan is expected to enhance&#13;
in 2012. The National Strategic Development Plan 2014-18                        citizen empowerment, accountability and local service&#13;
contains more ambitious targets of 60% improved access                          delivery. A positive recent development within this context&#13;
for rural and 85% of piped access for urban water supply                        is the current investigation, with support of ADB and WSP, to&#13;
respectively, and 60% for rural sanitation by 2018. Universal                   assign rural sanitation and rural water scheme maintenance&#13;

cess rates reported in NSDP seem to refer to piped supply, and do not include other forms&#13;
of improved access; 80% urban sanitation access was used for this calculation.                    cess for urban water supply mainly refers to piped supply,&#13;

   The NSDP 2014-2018 specifies a target of 80% access to improved sanitation for the urban population, however as per JMP (2014) estimates this is&#13;
already achieved (82% by 2012); the NSDP is not clear about the definition that applies to this target, however it seems that this refers to piped water supply&#13;
access&#13;
20&#13;
   The JMP definition for improved water supply includes all rainwater sources to be improved, although the Cambodia definition only considers rainwater to&#13;
be improved if it is stored in a tank of more than 3000 litres.&#13;

   Using JMP access rates might have led to conservative estimates for rural water supply as government estimates report a lower access rate; for rural&#13;
sanitation, it might have led to a slight overestimation of the costs as government estimates are higher than JMP. For urban sectors consistency between&#13;
JMP and government estimates seems better.&#13;
24&#13;
   By keeping the technology mix constant, it is expected that piped services would increase linearly from 5% in 2012 to 8% of total access by 2025.&#13;
However, it is to be expected that piped services provision will become increasingly viable in areas that are â&#128;&#156;characterizedâ&#128;&#157; as rural and hence this&#13;
assumption could be adjusted for the purpose of scenario assessment&#13;
25&#13;
   Based on CSES (2011), current levels of urban access to septic tanks connected to combined sewer systems is around half. However, there is hardly any&#13;
treatment capacity in place at this moment.&#13;

Subtracting the sum of anticipated CAPEX contributions of                                      ever, it is important to note that encouraging households to&#13;
the public and households from CAPEX requirements sug-                                         invest in improved facilities also entails costs in terms of ef-&#13;
gests deficits of US$57 million per year for water supply                                      forts by government and development partners in community&#13;
and US$85 million per year for sanitation. This implies that                                   mobilization and demand creation to solicit these assumed&#13;
projected investments fall far short of the amounts required                                   self-investments by households. This is especially relevant&#13;
to meet targets. The expected deficits suggest the need                                        for rural sanitation where over three quarters of the funds is&#13;
for increasingly higher expenditures throughout the period                                     expected to come from households, domestic resources for&#13;

&#13;
There is some uncertainty over the estimated deficits. Ag-                                     Figure 2.2 and 2.3 indicate that anticipated investments for&#13;

counting for expenditures of utilities and the private sector,                                 from 2010-12, although this is not the case for sanitation.&#13;
as well as not accounted for development partner funds that                                    While this is a good sign, anticipated investments still fall&#13;

Table 2.3 presents estimates of additional funding necessary&#13;
for the average annual operation and maintenance of water&#13;
supply and sanitation facilities till 202529. It indicates that wa-&#13;
ter supply and sanitation require on average annual funds of&#13;
US$10 million and US$14 million, respectively. Over two thirds&#13;
is required for urban areas, increasing pressure on household&#13;
finances on tariffs and maintaining household toilet facilities.&#13;
These estimates also provide a sense of the extent to which&#13;
utilities need to generate income to support their day-to-day&#13;
operational expenses, notwithstanding their need to generate&#13;
sufficient income to prepare for replacement and expansion&#13;
investments.&#13;

  Due to increasing levels of service till 2025, the O&amp;M costs will also increase over time. The figure shown in table 3 represents the average annual O&amp;M&#13;

 mune/sangkat fund and although some funds might be&#13;
 used for rural water supply and sanitation, over 90% of the&#13;
 expenditures are estimated to be allocated to rural road&#13;
 construction.56 At national level it is not possible to clearly&#13;
 track if funds have been spend on water supply and sanita-&#13;
 tion, as broad categories are defined as infrastructure and&#13;
 social services. Hence, water and sanitation spending un-&#13;
 der this fund has not yet been included. Water and sanita-&#13;
 tion expenditure under the recently established district and&#13;
 municipal fund (0.8% of national budget) is unknown and&#13;
 could not be included. In line with the ongoing decentraliza-&#13;
 tion reform, it is expected that more funding will become&#13;
 available at the discretion of sub-national authorities, in-&#13;
 cluding a sub-national investment fund from 2014 onwards,&#13;
 some of these funds might flow into the urban and rural wa-&#13;
 ter and sanitation sector. It will be important in the future to&#13;
 track and understand how such expenditure will (or will not)&#13;
 be contributing to the sector. Hence, it will be critical to bet-&#13;
 ter monitor spending at sub-national level through the na-&#13;
 tional Financial Management Information System on water&#13;
 and sanitation in the long-term. A first start is to implement&#13;
 national level programme-based budgeting for water and&#13;
 sanitation and to routinely monitor resource flows to the&#13;
 sector that are not going through the government budgets.&#13;

According to the JMP update 2014, 94% of the urban pop-                                   improved rainwater as their main water source.68 However,&#13;

&#13;

  As per the government definition rainwater is only considered improved if stored in a tank of more than 3000 liters. Due to the preference of rainwater taste,&#13;
most urban and rural households store and use rainwater at least as a complementary source for consumption, while relying on other sources for hygienic&#13;
uses.&#13;
69&#13;
  The difference between CSES 2011, and NSDP 2012 estimates piped access outside of Phnom Penh is most likely due to other definitions of urban areas.&#13;
The most recent CIPS (2013) estimates piped water supply access in urban areas slightly lower at 64%.&#13;

  The NSDP 2018 target does not clearly specify whether this target refers to piped household connections only.&#13;

      For rural water supply this might have led to underestimation of the investment costs, as for rainwater, only government definition of improved was included (&gt; 3000 l tank&#13;
    available), while the overall improved access levels of JMP 2014 were used (that include all rainwater as improved). However, this underestimation is not likely to have a&#13;
    major impact on the overall findings and narrative with respect to sector financing.&#13;
    91&#13;
      This estimate is based on the cost for the Niroth project, which was said to be around 200 USD/capita overall, covering 600,000 people costing US% 120 million. However&#13;
    to get a more realistic figure for expansion of urban services outside of Phnom Penh, expensive land costs (US$20 million), industrial treatment capacity (US$30 million),&#13;
    reduces the amount to around US$70 million for 600,000 people, which is USD 117.&#13;

   As per WSP Economics of Sanitation Study (2012), a septic tank costs US$215, and a wet lined soak pit around US$118. WB and ADB project cost for&#13;
soak pit are estimated at US$80 million. Thus, and average of US$80 has been used for a wet-pit; and the lifespan is expected to reflect the average between&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Cambodia :
            turning finance into services for the future
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Water and sanitation service delivery
            assessments (SDAs) are taking place in seven countries in
            the East Asia Pacific region under the guidance of the World
            Bank’s water and sanitation program (WSP) and local
            partners. The SDA analysis has three main components: a
            review of past water and sanitation coverage, a costing
            model to assess the adequacy of future investments, and a
            scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the
            service delivery pathway. Through the SDA process, an
            evidence based analysis has been conducted to better
            understand what undermines progress in water supply and
            sanitation and what the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC)
            can do to accelerate progress. The analysis aims to help the
            RGC to assess how it can strengthen pathways for turning
            finance into water supply and sanitation services in each of
            four subsectors. This report evaluates the service delivery
            pathway in its entirety, locating the bottlenecks and
            presenting priority actions to help address them during the
            current five year national strategic development plan 2014-2018.
