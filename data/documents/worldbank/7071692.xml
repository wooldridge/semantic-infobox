      I. OVERVIEW&#13;
&#13;
      International Finance Corporation (IFC or the Corporation) is an international organization, established in 1956, to&#13;
      further economic growth in its developing member countries by promoting private sector development. IFC is a&#13;
      member of the World Bank Group, which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
      Development (the World Bank), the International Development Association (IDA), and the Multilateral Investment&#13;
      Guarantee Agency (MIGA). It is a legal entity separate and distinct from the World Bank, IDA, and MIGA, with its&#13;
      own Articles of Agreement, share capital, financial structure, management, and staff. Membership in IFC is open&#13;
      only to member countries of the World Bank. As of June 30, 2006, IFC's entire share capital was held by 178&#13;
      member countries.&#13;
&#13;
      IFC's principal products are loans and equity investments, with a small guarantee portfolio. Unlike most&#13;
      multilateral development institutions, IFC does not accept host government guarantees of its loans. IFC raises&#13;
      virtually all of the funds for its lending activities through the issuance of debt obligations in the international&#13;
      capital markets, while maintaining a small borrowing window with the World Bank. Equity investments are funded&#13;
      from net worth. During the year ended June 30, 2006 (FY06), IFC had an authorized borrowing ceiling of $2.5&#13;
      billion (including $0.5 billion to allow for possible prefunding of the funding program for the year to June 30, 2007&#13;
      (FY07) during FY06).&#13;
&#13;
      IFC's capital base and its assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in US dollars. The Corporation seeks to&#13;
      minimize market risk (foreign exchange and interest rate risks) by closely matching the currency, rate bases, and&#13;
      maturity of its liabilities in various currencies with assets having the same characteristics. The Corporation controls&#13;
      residual market risk by utilizing currency and interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments.&#13;

II. FINANCIAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Basis of preparation of the Corporation's financial statements&#13;
&#13;
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to accounting principles generally accepted&#13;
in the United States (US GAAP).&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has traditionally prepared one set of financial statements and footnotes, complying with both US&#13;
GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, principally due to material differences&#13;
between US Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments&#13;
and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivatives and Certain Hedging&#13;
Relationships (collectively SFAS No. 133), and its counterpart in IFRS, IAS No. 39, Financial Instruments Recognition&#13;
and Measurement, it has not been possible for the Corporation to satisfy the requirements of both US GAAP and&#13;
IFRS via one set of financial statements since the year ended June 30, 2000.&#13;
&#13;
IFC is actively monitoring developments related to accounting standards and the primary basis for preparation of&#13;
its financial statements, all with a view to the necessary systems and controls to manage its various lines of&#13;
business. IFC now plans to resume presentation of its financial statements using IFRS upon completion of the&#13;
evaluation of an Exposure Draft of Proposed Amendments to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1,&#13;
Presentation of Financial Instruments Â­ Financial Instruments Puttable at Fair Value and Obligations Arising on&#13;
Liquidation, issued in June 2006, and in particular the application of this proposed amendment to IFC's capital&#13;
stock.&#13;
&#13;
Unless stated otherwise, discussions of financial performance herein refer to income after expenditures for&#13;
technical assistance and advisory service (TAAS), and expenditures for performance-based grants (PBG)&#13;
(operating income). Operating income excludes the effects of net gains (losses) on non-trading financial&#13;
instruments pursuant to SFAS No. 133. The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income are discussed in Section VII.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial performance summary&#13;
&#13;
From year to year, IFC's operating income is affected by a number of factors, principally the magnitude of&#13;
provisions for losses against its loans and guarantees; impairment of equity investments; loans in nonaccrual status&#13;
and recoveries of interest on loans formerly in nonaccrual status; and income (dividends and capital gains)&#13;
generated from its equity portfolio. A significant part of IFC's liquid assets portfolio is invested in fixed income&#13;
securities, which are also subject to external market factors that affect the value of such securities, adding&#13;
variability to operating income. Net income also includes net gains and losses on financial instruments other than&#13;
from trading activities, pursuant to SFAS No. 133.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has been consistently profitable since its inception in 1956, and recorded operating income for FY06 of $1,409&#13;
million, as compared with $1,953 million for the year ended June 30, 2005 (FY05), and $982 million for the year&#13;
ended June 30, 2004 (FY04). The $1,953 million of operating income in FY05 was a record high for the Corporation.&#13;
FY06 operating income continued to reflect strong contributions across each of IFC's main product lines: loans,&#13;
equities and treasury operations. The Corporation reported net income in FY06, including the effects of SFAS No.&#13;
133, of $1,278 million, as compared with record net income of $2,015 million for FY05 and $993 million for FY04.&#13;

III. CLIENT SERVICES&#13;
&#13;
Business overview&#13;
&#13;
In partnership with private investors, IFC assists in financing the establishment, improvement, and expansion of&#13;
private sector enterprises by making investments where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on&#13;
reasonable terms. IFC seeks to bring together domestic and foreign private capital and experienced&#13;
management and thereby create conditions conducive to the flow of private capital (domestic and foreign)&#13;
into productive investments in its developing member countries. In this way, IFC plays a catalytic role in&#13;
mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through loan&#13;
syndications and guarantees. In addition to project finance (described below) and resource mobilization, IFC&#13;
offers financial and technical advisory services to private businesses in developing member countries. It also&#13;
advises member governments on private sector development matters.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's investments are normally made in its developing member countries. The Articles of Agreement mandate&#13;
that IFC shall invest in productive private enterprise. The requirement for private ownership does not disqualify&#13;
enterprises that are partly owned by the public sector if such enterprises are organized under local commercial&#13;
and corporate law, operate free of host government control in a market context and according to profitability&#13;
criteria, and/or are in the process of being totally or partially privatized.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation's main investment activity is project financing. This encompasses "greenfield" projects,&#13;
expansions, and modernizations. IFC also provides corporate credits to selected companies to finance ongoing&#13;
programs of investment projects. In addition, the Corporation facilitates financing through financial&#13;
intermediaries, covering project and general purpose lending and specialized lending products such as leasing,&#13;
trade, and mortgage finance. These financial intermediaries function either as IFC's borrower, on-lending to&#13;
private sector companies at their own risk, or as IFC's agent, identifying companies for direct loans from IFC.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation applies stringent tests of enterprise soundness, project viability, and developmental impact in&#13;
determining the eligibility of projects for its investments.&#13;
&#13;
Technical assistance and advisory services&#13;
IFC has historically delivered its mission primarily through investments. IFC has increased its efforts in frontier&#13;
markets and sustainable development impact. As a result, the demands on the Corporation for associated&#13;
advisory work and technical assistance have increased and continue to grow. In FY04, IFC established a funding&#13;
mechanism for technical assistance and advisory services, funded by designations of IFC's retained earnings.&#13;
This funding mechanism finances project development facilities, private enterprise partnerships, and similar&#13;
facilities focused on small and medium-size enterprise development and similar initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
Amounts designated for technical assistance and advisory services are determined based on the Corporation's&#13;
annual operating income in excess of $150 million, contemplating the financial capacity and priorities of the&#13;
Corporation, and are approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors prior to the issuance of the annual&#13;
financial statements. Expenditures for the various approved technical assistance and advisory projects are&#13;
recorded as expenses in the Corporation's income statement in the year in which they occur, beginning in FY05,&#13;
and have the effect of reducing retained earnings designated for this specific purpose. Prior to FY06, IFC's Board&#13;
of Directors had approved designations of $350 million of the Corporation's retained earnings. On August 7,&#13;
2006, IFC's Board of Directors approved a further designation of $230 million of the Corporation's retained&#13;
earnings. IFC incurred expenditures for technical assistance and advisory services of $38 million in FY05 and $55&#13;
million in FY06, thereby reducing the amount of retained earnings designated for technical assistance and&#13;
advisory services at June 30, 2006 to $487 million. Additional information on the funding mechanism for technical&#13;
assistance and advisory services can be found in Notes A and K to the Corporation's FY06 financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Performance-based grants&#13;
In FY05, IFC began the analysis to create a program to fund performance-based grants, targeted at specific&#13;
industries in developing countries, particularly frontier areas. The performance-based grants initiative (PBGI)&#13;
establishes a pool of resources for funding performance-based grants to individual private-sector projects in&#13;
developing markets. The PBGI furthers IFC's frontier strategy by opening new opportunities to generate&#13;
developmental impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                     volume 2PAGE 5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      The initiative had been discussed by IFC's Board of Directors during the second half of FY05 but no decisions on&#13;
      the principles or modalities of the initiative were made at that time. As a result, IFC designated $250 million of&#13;
      retained earnings for the initiative, with further deliberations to occur in FY06 on the principles and specifics of the&#13;
      initiative. On March 30, 2006, IFC's Board of Directors approved an implementation mechanism for the initiative&#13;
      and an initial pilot phase of $65 million. During FY06, IFC provided $35 million to the World Bank's Global&#13;
      Partnership on Output Based Aid under the pilot phase; this amount has been recorded as an expense in FY06,&#13;
      thereby reducing the amount of retained earnings designated for performance-based grants at June 30, 2006 to&#13;
      $215 million.&#13;
&#13;
      Grants to IDA&#13;
      As part of the efforts of the members of the World Bank Group to increase their cooperation, and in particular to&#13;
      benefit the poorest countries, IFC and IDA have discussed the possibility of providing resources for the benefit of&#13;
      IDA projects in countries which are members of both IFC and IDA. IFC plans to grant monies to IDA to be applied&#13;
      to IDA grant projects that encourage the growth of productive private enterprise in countries that are members&#13;
      of both IFC and IDA. On August 7, 2006, IFC's Board of Directors approved the designation of $150 million to IDA&#13;
      for such purposes.&#13;
&#13;
      Investment process and portfolio supervision&#13;
      IFC's investment process can be divided into six main stages:&#13;
&#13;
                                                        Prior to May 15, 2006, the initial four stages were carried out under the&#13;
                        Identification and              responsibility of the Vice President, Investment Operations. Beginning on May&#13;
                        appraisal                       15, 2006 they were carried out under the responsibility of the Vice President,&#13;
                        Board approval                  Industries. During FY06, the fifth and sixth stages were overseen by the Vice&#13;
                        Document negotiation            President, Portfolio and Risk Management.&#13;
                        Commitment&#13;
                        Disbursement                    The Corporation carefully supervises its projects to monitor project&#13;
                        Supervision                     performance and compliance with contractual obligations and with IFC's&#13;
                                                        internal policies and procedures. IFC's Board of Directors is informed of such&#13;
                                                        matters and of recommended courses of action at regular intervals.&#13;

      Disbursed B-loans&#13;
      The portfolio of disbursed and outstanding B-loans which are serviced by the Corporation at June 30, 2006&#13;
      totaled $3.9 billion in 172 transactions, compared with $4.4 billion in 204 transactions at June 30, 2005.&#13;
&#13;

      Loans&#13;
      Loans account for the major part of the financing provided by IFC, representing 79% of the Corporation's&#13;
      disbursed investment portfolio as of June 30, 2006, compared with 80% at June 30, 2005.&#13;

Loans will generally have the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  Term: typically amortizing with final maturities of up to 12 years&#13;
                  Currency: primarily in major convertible currencies, principally US dollar, and to a lesser extent, Euro, Swiss&#13;
                  franc and Japanese yen&#13;
                  Interest rate: fixed or variable&#13;
                  Pricing: reflects such factors as market conditions and country and project risks; variable rate loans are&#13;
                  generally tied to the 6-month LIBOR index in the relevant currency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC offers local currency loan products to certain clients, provided that the Corporation is able to hedge its local&#13;
currency exposure through mechanisms such as cross-currency swaps or forward contracts. Fixed-rate loans and&#13;
loans in currencies other than US dollars are normally transformed, using currency and/or interest rate swaps, into&#13;
US dollar variable rate loans.&#13;
&#13;
On June 30, 2006, IFC's disbursed loan portfolio was $10.8 billion ($10.0 billion at June 30, 2005). At June 30, 2006,&#13;
76% (81% at June 30, 2005) of the Corporation's disbursed loan portfolio, excluding fair value adjustments for&#13;
loans in qualifying hedging relationships and unamortized net deferred loan origination fees, was US dollar-&#13;
denominated.&#13;
&#13;
The currency composition of the disbursed loan portfolio, excluding fair value adjustments for loans in qualifying&#13;
hedging relationships and unamortized net deferred loan origination fees, at June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005 is&#13;

&#13;
Equity&#13;
Equity investments accounted for 21% of the Corporation's disbursed investment portfolio at June 30, 2006,&#13;
compared with 20% at June 30, 2005. IFC's equity investments are typically in the form of common or preferred&#13;
stock and are usually denominated in the currency of the country in which the investment is made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Quasi-equity&#13;
In addition to traditional equity investments, the Corporation provides financing through a variety of quasi-equity&#13;
instruments, which constitute a growing portion of its investment portfolio. Quasi-equities include subordinated or&#13;
convertible loans, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and certain common or preferred shares&#13;
with put and/or call features. Depending upon their characteristics, quasi-equities may be classified as either&#13;
loans or equity investments in the Corporation's consolidated balance sheet. At June 30, 2006, the Corporation's&#13;
disbursed quasi-equity portfolio, before fair value adjustments on loans in qualifying hedging relationships,&#13;
adjustments to investments accounted for under the equity method, unrealized gains on equity investments held&#13;
by consolidated VIEs, and unamortized net deferred loan origination fees, totaled $1,935 million ($1,768 million at&#13;
June 30, 2005), of which $1,808 million was classified as loans ($1,638 million at June 30, 2005) and $127 million was&#13;
classified as equity investments ($130 million at June 30, 2005) in the Corporation's consolidated balance sheet.&#13;

                                                                                                                                volume 2PAGE &#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       Loan participations (B-loans)&#13;
       IFC finances only a portion, usually not more than 25%, of the cost of any project. All IFC-financed projects,&#13;
       therefore, require other financial partners. The principal direct means by which the Corporation mobilizes such&#13;
       private sector finance is through the sale of participations in its loans, known as the B-loan program. Through the&#13;
       B-loan program, IFC has worked primarily with commercial banks but also with nonbank financial institutions in&#13;
       financing projects since the early 1960s. Over 150 commercial banks and nonbank financial institutions currently&#13;
       participate in IFC's B-loan program.&#13;
&#13;
       Whenever it participates a loan, IFC will always make a loan for its own account (an A-loan), thereby sharing the&#13;
       risk alongside its loan participants. IFC acts as the lender of record and is responsible for the administration of the&#13;
       entire loan, including the B-loan. IFC charges fees to the borrower at prevailing market rates to cover the cost of&#13;
       the syndication of the B-loan. Since it began its loan syndication program, IFC has placed participations totaling&#13;
       $26 billion.&#13;
&#13;
       Client risk management products&#13;
       IFC provides clients with access to asset and liability management tools such as currency swaps and interest rate&#13;
       swaps, caps and floors by acting as an intermediary between clients and market counterparties. IFC also&#13;
       provides risk-sharing structures and guarantees that allow its clients to transact directly with market&#13;
       counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
       Guarantees and partial credit guarantees&#13;
       The Corporation offers partial credit guarantees to clients covering, on a risk-sharing basis, client obligations on&#13;
       bonds and/or loans. The Corporation's guarantee is available for debt instruments and trade obligations of&#13;
       clients and covers commercial as well as noncommercial risks. IFC will provide local currency guarantees, but&#13;
       when a guarantee is called, the client will generally be obligated to reimburse the Corporation in US dollar terms.&#13;
       Guarantee fees are consistent with IFC's loan pricing policies. During FY06, the Corporation signed $0.6 billion of&#13;
       guarantees, $0.2 billion in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
       Advisory activities&#13;
       The Corporation, on its own or through a department jointly managed with the World Bank, provides three&#13;
       general types of advisory services to member countries and individual enterprises:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Special advisory services on project structuring and financial packaging.&#13;
              Financial advisory services provided to member governments or to private sector clients.&#13;
              Policy advice to governments on capital markets development and private sector development,&#13;
              including privatization and foreign investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation also assists governments with developing legal frameworks for privatizing their state-owned&#13;
       sectors and selling individual enterprises. Fees are charged for advisory services consistent with market rates&#13;
       charged for comparable services. IFC recorded such fees amounting to $52 million for FY06 ($41 million for FY05&#13;
       and $41 million for FY04).&#13;

Technical assistance and advisory services&#13;
Technical assistance and advisory services (TAAS) involve the provision of advice and capacity building support&#13;
and services to entities external to the Corporation. TAAS are key to IFC's development mission and now form a&#13;
core line of business that is part of IFC's "branding." IFC's TAAS are central to IFC's mission of improving the&#13;
private sector in its member countries. IFC's TAAS operations are often the focal point of IFC's engagement in&#13;
many member countries where investment opportunities are nascent. Currently IFC implements TAAS operations&#13;
in more than 100 countries. Beginning in FY05, the Corporation established a funding mechanism for TAAS,&#13;
funded by designations of IFC's retained earnings, in order to address its increased efforts in TAAS. IFC delivers&#13;
TAAS through mechanisms such as Project Development Facilities and Private Enterprise Partnerships. In FY06,&#13;
expenditures for TAAS totaled $55 million ($38 million for FY05 and $29 million in FY04). In FY06, such initiatives&#13;
included:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      The Private Enterprise Partnership, which provides focused technical assistance, with the goal of helping&#13;
      build successful private businesses in the former Soviet Union region.&#13;
      The Private Enterprise Partnership for Africa, which enhances support to Small and Medium-Size&#13;
      Enterprises (SMEs) through project development and engaging in improving the investment climate.&#13;
      The Private Enterprise Partnership for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), which provides technical&#13;
      assistance to support private sector development to all countries in the MENA region.&#13;
      The Latin America SME Facility, which promotes private sector growth through SMEs in selected countries&#13;
      in Latin America with the aim of fostering job creation and reducing poverty in the host countries.&#13;
      The Grassroots Business Initiative, which strengthens and expands support to grassroots business&#13;
      organizations.&#13;

       Liquid assets&#13;
&#13;
       IFC invests its liquidity in highly rated fixed and floating rate instruments issued by, or unconditionally guaranteed&#13;
       by, governments, government agencies and instrumentalities, multilateral organizations, and AAA-rated&#13;
       corporate issuers; these include mortgage- and asset-backed securities, time deposits and other unconditional&#13;
       obligations of banks and financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation manages the market risk associated with these investments through a variety of hedging&#13;
       techniques including derivatives, principally currency and interest rate swaps and financial futures.&#13;
&#13;
       IFC's liquid assets are invested in five separate portfolios.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings&#13;
The major source of IFC's borrowings is the international capital markets. Under the Articles of Agreement, the&#13;
Corporation may borrow in the public markets of a member country only with approvals from that member and&#13;
also the member in whose currency the borrowing is denominated. The Corporation borrowed $1.8 billion during&#13;
FY06 ($2.0 billion in FY05 and $3.0 billion in FY04). In addition, IFC's Board of Directors has authorized the&#13;
repurchase and redemption of and tender for debt obligations issued by the Corporation. During FY06, the&#13;
Corporation repurchased and retired $209 million of outstanding debt ($133 million in FY05).&#13;
&#13;
IFC diversifies its borrowings by currency, country, source, and maturity to provide flexibility and cost-&#13;
effectiveness. Outstanding market borrowings have remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to&#13;
almost 30 years, with a weighted average remaining maturity of 10.7 years at June 30, 2006 (11.6 years at June&#13;
30, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
Market borrowings are generally swapped into floating-rate obligations denominated in US dollars. As of June 30,&#13;
2006 the Corporation had gross payables from borrowing-related currency swaps of $8.5 billion ($9.4 billion at&#13;
June 30, 2005) and from borrowing-related interest rate swaps in the notional principal amount of $6.7 billion ($6.7&#13;
billion at June 30, 2005). After the effect of these derivative instruments is taken into consideration, substantially&#13;
all of the Corporation's market borrowings at June 30, 2006, and all of the Corporation's market borrowings at&#13;
June 30, 2005, were US dollar-denominated.&#13;
&#13;
The weighted average cost of market borrowings after currency and interest rate swap transactions was 4.9% at&#13;
June 30, 2006 (3.3% at June 30, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
Capital and retained earnings&#13;
As of June 30, 2006, IFC's net worth (presented as Total Capital in the Corporation's consolidated balance sheet)&#13;
amounted to $11.1 billion, up from the June 30, 2005 level of $9.8 billion. At June 30, 2006, net worth comprised&#13;
$2.4 billion of paid-in capital, unchanged from June 30, 2005, and $8.7 billion of retained earnings ($7.4 billion at&#13;
June 30, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
As of June 30, 2006 and 2005, IFC's authorized capital was $2.45 billion, of which $2.36 billion was subscribed at&#13;
June 30, 2006, unchanged from June 30, 2005. Over 99% of this was paid in ($2.36 billion at June 30, 2006, and&#13;
June 30, 2005). The Corporation has agreed to defer the payment dates for certain member countries. Pursuant&#13;
to these arrangements, $1 million of subscribed shares remained unpaid at June 30, 2006, unchanged from June&#13;
30, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
At June 30, 2006, retained earnings comprised $7.8 billion of undesignated retained earnings ($6.9 billion at June&#13;
30, 2005), $0.5 billion of retained earnings for TAAS ($0.3 billion at June 30, 2005), $0.2 billion of retained earnings&#13;
designated for PBG ($0.3 billion at June 30, 2005), and $0.2 billion of retained earnings designated for grants to&#13;
IDA ($0 at June 30, 2005).&#13;

       V. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
       In executing its sustainable private sector development business, IFC assumes various kinds of risks. The&#13;
       Corporation's management has defined a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, within which&#13;
       it recognizes four main risk groupings: strategic risk, credit risk, financial risk, and operational risk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                    People, Systems, &amp; Processes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Active management of these risks is a key determinant of the Corporation's success and its ability to maintain a&#13;
       stable capital and earnings base, and is an essential part of its operations. As part of its enterprise risk&#13;
       management framework, the Corporation has adopted several key financial and exposure policies and a&#13;
       number of prudential policies.&#13;
&#13;
       FY06 enterprise risk highlights&#13;
       The recently created Project Risk Management function (organized as part of IFC's Financial Operations&#13;
       Department) has developed and implemented detailed operational risk management controls and procedures&#13;
       and has implemented these across our most important industry groups. These updated procedures will be&#13;
       implemented in FY07 for all new projects. Also in FY07, this group will establish appropriate staff in the regional&#13;
       centers, thus significantly improving the management of investment project administration and compliance&#13;
       monitoring within the regions.&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation initiated policy reviews in two areas: first, of its financial policies, to confirm that these are in line&#13;
       with new business imperatives and best practices in risk management; secondly, of its Safeguard Policies, Policy&#13;
       on Disclosure of Information, and Environmental, Health &amp; Safety (EHS) Guidelines, involving a comprehensive&#13;
       update of its policies and guidelines, subsequent to stakeholder consultation and expert guidance.&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation is committed to ensuring that it has timely, effective and efficient risk management controls at&#13;
       each step of its investment process, and in FY06, made the commitment to increase risk management staffing&#13;
       and to place key credit risk managers in the regional hubs to improve the timeliness and quality of the risk&#13;
       decision process. The sophistication of the risk process at IFC necessitates reviews of economic and social risks,&#13;
       corporate governance standards for clients, and reputation risk reviews in addition to the more traditional credit&#13;
       quality and operational concerns. The Corporation believes that this move to put key decision risk makers in the&#13;
       regions will significantly improve the quality of its enterprise risk management, and will implement this strategy in&#13;
       the first quarter of FY07.&#13;
&#13;
       Strategic risk&#13;
&#13;
       IFC defines strategic risk as the potential reputational, financial and other consequences of a failure to achieve&#13;
       its strategic mission and, in particular, its sustainable development mandate.&#13;
&#13;
       The overall management of strategic risk is effected through the definition and implementation of an annual&#13;
       strategy for meeting the Corporation's mission and guidelines for its investment operations and advisory services.&#13;
       The strategy is developed with Senior Management by the Operational Strategy Group, and is approved by the&#13;
       Board of Directors. The Independent Evaluation Group (formerly the Operations Evaluation Group) conducts ex&#13;
       post evaluations of the implementation of the Corporation's investment strategy on an ongoing basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The Corporation's commitment to quality enterprise risk management, particularly on the environment and social&#13;
front, continues to gain acceptance with our strategic partners as the "Equator Principles" announced in FY05&#13;
have now become an established standard for financial institutions engaged in finance in the emerging markets.&#13;
Responsibility for managing these economic and social risk principles both internally and in liaison with other&#13;
financial institutions rests with the Environment and Social Development Department. In addition, the&#13;
Corporation is focused on ensuring the evolving principles of corporate governance are accepted and&#13;
practiced by our clients, and we place great emphasis on developing these standards as part of our&#13;
development activities. Responsibility for managing corporate governance both internally and within projects&#13;
rests with the Corporate Governance Department. More broadly, the responsibility for the management of the&#13;
fundamental reputational risk associated with the selection of project sponsors and the review of aspects relating&#13;
to integrity rests with the operational departments, in which they are supported by the Business Risk Department.&#13;
&#13;
The key guiding principles and policies established as part of the framework for controlling strategic risk are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Guiding principles for IFC's operations&#13;
  Catalytic role: IFC will seek above all to be a catalyst in facilitating productive investments in the private&#13;
  sector of its developing member countries. It does so by mobilizing financing from both foreign and&#13;
  domestic investors from the private and public sectors.&#13;
&#13;
  Business partnership: IFC functions like a business in partnership with the private sector. Thus, IFC takes the&#13;
  same commercial risks as do private institutions, investing its funds under the discipline of the marketplace.&#13;
&#13;
  Additionality: IFC participates in an investment only when it can make a special contribution not offered or&#13;
  brought to the deal by other investors.&#13;
&#13;
  Environmental and social policies&#13;
  The Corporation has developed a comprehensive set of Guidelines and Safeguard Policies to promote&#13;
  environmentally and socially responsible private sector investments. Project sponsors are given the&#13;
  Safeguard Policies for environmental and social issues to review prior to conducting their assessments, as&#13;
  well as the environmental, health, and safety guidelines specific to the particular industry, sector, and type&#13;
  of project.&#13;
&#13;
  When making investments, IFC applies its standards to the project and project performance is monitored&#13;
  against those standards. Projects are expected to comply with the applicable policies and guidelines, as&#13;
  well as applicable local, national, and international laws.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY06 strategic risk highlights&#13;
IFC's Environmental and Social Policies have become widely recognized as best practice when twelve&#13;
international commercial banks adopted them in the form of the Equator Principles. To date, more than 30&#13;
leading international financial institutions have adopted these principles. During FY06, the Business Risk&#13;
Department has started developing tools to help the Corporation's operational departments analyze broader&#13;
reputation risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Credit risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines credit risk as the potential reduction in value of on- and off-balance sheet assets due to a&#13;
deteriorating credit profile of its clients, the countries in which it invests, or a financial counterparty. Credit risk is&#13;
incurred in two areas of the Corporation's operations: (i) in its investment operations, where IFC provides loans,&#13;
equity investments, guarantees and derivatives for clients in its developing member countries, and (ii) in its&#13;
treasury operations, where credit risk is incurred with counterparties in IFC's liquid asset investment, borrowing and&#13;
asset-liability management activities. As part of its mandate, IFC is prohibited from accepting host government&#13;
guarantees of repayment on its investments and, therefore, incurs commercial and sovereign risk on its&#13;
investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                         volume 2PAGE 15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       The Corporation's Risk Management and Financial Policy Department has oversight responsibility for overall credit&#13;
       risk management and, in addition, monitors and controls credit risk arising in IFC's treasury activities. With respect&#13;
       to IFC's credit risk exposures to clients in developing countries, the Credit Review Department plays a key role. At&#13;
       origination of new investments, the Credit Review Department analyzes information obtained from the&#13;
       investment departments and provides an independent review of the credit risk of the transaction. After&#13;
       commitment, the quality of IFC's loan and equity investment portfolio is monitored according to supervision&#13;
       principles and procedures defined in the Operational Policies and Procedures. Responsibility for the day-to-day&#13;
       monitoring and management of credit risk in the portfolio rests with the portfolio management units of individual&#13;
       investment departments. Their assessments are subject to quarterly review, on a sample basis, by the Loss&#13;
       Provisioning Division of the Controller's and Budgeting Department and by the Credit Review Department.&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation's investment portfolio is subject to a number of operational and prudential limits, including&#13;
       limitations on single project/client exposure, single country exposure, and segment concentration. Similarly,&#13;
       credit policies and guidelines have been formulated covering treasury operations; these are subject to annual&#13;
       revision by the Risk Management and Financial Policy Department, and approval by the Finance and Risk&#13;
       Committee. Specifically, IFC has adopted the following key exposure policies:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Investment operations+&#13;
          1.  IFC does not normally finance for its own account more than 25% of a project's cost.&#13;
          2.  An equity investment in a company does not normally represent more than 35% of the company's total&#13;
              share capital, provided further that IFC is not the single largest shareholder. Until IFC resumes&#13;
              presentation of its financial statements in accordance with IFRS, IFC's equity investment in a company&#13;
              will not normally represent more than 20% of the company's total share capital.&#13;
          3.  Investment in a single obligor may not exceed 4% of IFC's net worth plus general reserves on loans.&#13;
          4.  Equity plus quasi-equity investments in a single obligor may not exceed 3% of the Corporation's net&#13;
              worth plus general reserves on loans, and straight equity investments may not exceed 1.5%.&#13;
          Portfolio Management&#13;
          1.  Review trigger levels of between 2.5% and 10% of net worth plus general reserves on loans are set for&#13;
              each country's outstanding portfolio, net of specific reserves on loans, based on the size of its economy&#13;
              and its risk rating.&#13;
          2.  IFC lender of record disbursed exposure in a country may not exceed 10% for Heavily Indebted Poor&#13;
              Countries and 5% for all other countries. Exceptions for countries with low levels of external debt may&#13;
              be set by the Finance and Risk Committee. Lower trigger levels are set for certain countries.&#13;
          3.  The Corporation's total exposure to a single risk sector may not exceed 12% of net worth plus general&#13;
              reserves on loans. Lower review trigger levels are set for single sectors, and individually for the finance&#13;
              and insurance sector, based on IFC's net worth plus general reserves on loans and the country&#13;
              exposure level.&#13;
          4.  IFC's held guarantees that are subrogated in local currency are limited to $200 million.&#13;
          Treasury operations&#13;
          1.  Counterparties are subject to conservative eligibility criteria, currently restricted to banks and financial&#13;
              institutions with a minimum credit rating of A by leading international credit rating agencies.&#13;
          2.  Exposures to individual counterparties are subject to diversification caps. For derivatives, exposure is&#13;
              measured in terms of "worst case" potential exposure based on simulations of market variables.&#13;
              Institution-specific limits are updated monthly based on changes in counterparty size or credit status.&#13;
          3.  To limit exposure, IFC signs collateral agreements with counterparties that require the posting of&#13;
              collateral when net exposure exceeds certain predetermined thresholds, which decrease as a&#13;
              counterparty's credit rating deteriorates.&#13;
          4.  Because counterparties can be downgraded during the life of a transaction, the agreements provide&#13;
              an option for IFC to terminate all swaps if the counterparty is downgraded below investment grade or if&#13;
              other early termination events occur that are standard in the market.&#13;
          5.  Limits are also imposed on the volume of over-the-counter derivative transactions with individual&#13;
              counterparties.&#13;
          6.  For exchange-traded instruments, IFC limits credit risk by restricting transactions to a list of authorized&#13;
              exchanges, contracts and dealers, and by placing limits on the Corporation's open interest rate&#13;
              position in each contract.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
FY06 credit risk highlights&#13;
IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are&#13;
past due more than 60 days unless management anticipates that collection of interest is expected in the near&#13;
future.&#13;
&#13;
The amount of nonaccruing loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, excluding fair value&#13;
adjustments for loans in qualifying hedging relationships and unamortized net deferred loan origination fees, a&#13;
key indicator of portfolio performance, decreased to 4.1% at June 30, 2006 (6.4% at June 30, 2005). The principal&#13;
amount outstanding on nonaccrual loans totaled $447 million at June 30, 2006, a decrease of $187 million (29%)&#13;
from the June 30, 2005 level of $634 million.&#13;
&#13;
The quality of IFC's loan and equity investment portfolio, as measured by the aggregate risk level, improved&#13;
further during FY06, continuing the trends noted during FY05 and FY04. As a result, total reserves against losses on&#13;
loans at June 30, 2006, decreased to $898 million ($989 million at June 30, 2005). This is equivalent to 8.3% of the&#13;
disbursed loan portfolio, excluding fair value adjustments for loans in qualifying hedging relationships and&#13;
unamortized net deferred loan origination fees, significantly below the level of 9.9% at June 30, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
The five-year trend of reserves against losses on loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, excluding&#13;
fair value adjustments for loans in qualifying hedging relationships and unamortized net deferred loan origination&#13;
fees, is presented below:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation operates under the assumption that the guarantee portfolio is exposed to the same&#13;
idiosyncratic and systematic risks as IFC's loan portfolio and the inherent, probable losses in the guarantee&#13;
portfolio need to be covered by an allowance for loss. The allowance at June 30, 2006, was $18 million ($13&#13;
million at June 30, 2005), based on the year-end portfolio, and is included in payables and other liabilities on the&#13;
Corporation's consolidated balance sheet. The increase in allowance for the year, $5 million for FY06 ($3 million&#13;
reduction for FY05), is included in the provision for losses on loans and guarantees in the consolidated income&#13;
statement.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has not suffered credit losses on its exposures to derivatives counterparties in its treasury&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
Financial risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines financial risk in three components: (a) the potential inability to realize asset values in its portfolio&#13;
sufficient to meet obligations to disburse funds as they arise (liquidity risk); (b) the potential inability to access&#13;
funding at reasonable cost (funding risk); and (c) a deterioration in values of financial instruments or positions due&#13;
to changes in market interest and exchange rates and the volatility thereof (market risk).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                      volume 2PAGE 17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       Key financial policies&#13;
       IFC currently operates under a number of key financial policies as detailed below, which have been approved&#13;
       by its Board of Directors:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          1.  Disbursed equity plus quasi-equity investments (net of impairment write-downs) may not exceed 100%&#13;
              of net worth and disbursed equity (net of write-downs) may not exceed 50% of net worth.&#13;
&#13;
          2.  Minimum liquidity (liquid assets plus undrawn borrowing commitments from the World Bank) must be&#13;
              sufficient at all times to cover at least 65% of IFC's estimated net cash requirements for the next three&#13;
              years.&#13;
&#13;
          3.  The currency, rate basis, and maturity of loan assets must be closely matched to borrowings; trigger&#13;
              levels at which foreign exchange and interest rate exposures are hedged are defined.&#13;
&#13;
          4.  Capital (paid-in capital plus retained earnings plus general loan loss reserves) must equal at least 30% of&#13;
              risk-weighted assets.&#13;
&#13;
          In addition, under IFC's Articles of Agreement, as long as IFC has outstanding borrowings from the World&#13;
          Bank, IFC's leverage, as measured by the ratio of IFC's debt (borrowings plus outstanding guarantees) to&#13;
          IFC's equity (subscribed capital plus retained earnings), may not exceed 4.0 to 1.&#13;

&#13;
       Liquidity risk&#13;
&#13;
       Within the key financial policies described above, in practice the Corporation maintains, as a prudential&#13;
       measure, an operating liquidity target of not less than 70% of three years' net cash requirements, including&#13;
       projected disbursement and debt service requirements.&#13;
&#13;
       The primary instruments for maintaining sufficient liquidity are the Corporation's liquid asset portfolios. As noted&#13;
       above, IFC distinguishes five such portfolios:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              P0, which is generally invested in short-dated deposits, money market funds, and tri-party repos,&#13;
              reflecting its use for short-term funding requirements.&#13;
              P1, which is generally invested in: (a) foreign sovereign, sovereign-guaranteed and supranational fixed&#13;
              income instruments (rated AA- or better); (b) US Treasury or agency instruments; (c) asset-backed&#13;
              securities rated AAA by at least two rating agencies and/or other AAA rated notes issued by&#13;
              Corporations; (d) interest rate futures and swaps to manage currency risk in the portfolio, as well as its&#13;
              duration relative to benchmark; and (e) cash deposits.&#13;
              P2, which is generally invested in US Treasuries and other sovereign and agency issues.&#13;
              P3, which comprises a global fixed income portfolio and a mortgage-backed securities portfolio&#13;
              (managed by external managers).&#13;
              P4, which is an outsourced portion of the P2 portfolio (managed by external managers).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       FY06 liquidity risk highlights&#13;
       At June 30, 2006, the Corporation's liquidity level stood at $12.7 billion, or 112% of its projected net cash&#13;
       requirements for three years ($13.3 billion, and 142% at June 30, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
       Funding risk&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation's primary objective with respect to managing funding risk is, through the adoption of the key&#13;
       financial policies described above, to maintain its AAA credit rating and, thereby, maintain access to funding as&#13;
       needed at the lowest possible cost. Access to funding is maximized, and cost is minimized, by issuing debt&#13;
       securities in various capital markets in a variety of currencies, sometimes using complex structures. These&#13;
       structures include borrowings payable in multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest&#13;
       determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market index, a reference interest rate, a&#13;
       commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates.&#13;

FY06 funding risk highlights&#13;
During FY06, the Corporation raised $1.8 billion ($2.0 billion in FY05) of funding at sub-LIBOR rates.&#13;
&#13;
Market risk&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation's exposure to market risk is minimized by adopting the matched funding policy noted above&#13;
and by using a variety of derivative instruments to convert assets and liabilities into 6-month floating rate US dollar&#13;
assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
Investment operations&#13;
Implementation of the matched funding policy is a two-step process: funds are earmarked at Board approval&#13;
stage and matched, with respect to interest rate and currency, at disbursement. Interest rate and currency&#13;
exchange risk associated with fixed rate and/or non-US dollar lending is hedged via currency and interest rate&#13;
swaps that convert cash flows into variable rate US dollar flows.&#13;
&#13;
Exposures to market risk resulting from derivative transactions with clients, which are intended to facilitate clients'&#13;
risk management, are minimized by entering into offsetting positions with highly rated market counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolios&#13;
Consistent with the matched funding policy, the P0, P1 and P3 portfolios are strictly managed to variable rate US&#13;
dollar benchmarks, on a portfolio basis. To this end, a variety of derivative instruments are used, including short-&#13;
term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and&#13;
exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. The Corporation also takes both long and short positions in&#13;
securities in the management of these portfolios to their respective benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
The primary source of market risk in the liquid asset portfolios is the P2 and P4 portfolios, which, in contrast, are&#13;
managed to a three-year duration US dollar benchmark, with additional flexibility to deviate from the&#13;
benchmark. P2 represents the portion of IFC's capital not disbursed as equity investments, and the benchmark&#13;
reflects the chosen risk profile for this uninvested capital. P4 represents an outsourced portion of the P2 portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities&#13;
Market risk associated with fixed rate obligations and structured instruments entered into as part of the&#13;
Corporation's funding program is generally mitigated by using derivative instruments to convert them into&#13;
variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with the matched-funding policy.&#13;
&#13;
Asset-liability management&#13;
While IFC's matched-funding policy provides a significant level of protection against currency and interest rate&#13;
risk, the Corporation can be exposed to residual market risk in its overall asset and liability management. This&#13;
residual market risk is monitored by the Asset-Liability Management group within the Treasury Department.&#13;
&#13;
Residual currency risk arises from events such as changes in the level of non-US dollar loan loss reserves. This risk is&#13;
managed by monitoring the aggregate position in each lending currency and hedging the exposure when the&#13;
net asset or liability position exceeds $5 million equivalent, through spot sales or purchases.&#13;
&#13;
Residual interest rate risk may arise from two sources:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Assets that are fully match-funded at inception, which can become mismatched over time due to&#13;
        write-downs, prepayments, or rescheduling; and&#13;
        Differing interest rate reset dates on assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This residual risk is managed by: first, synchronizing interest rate reset dates on assets and liabilities at a portfolio&#13;
level; and second, measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each&#13;
basis point change in interest rates, with an action trigger of $50,000 on this measure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                                        volume 2PAGE 1&#13;

       FY06 market risk highlights&#13;
       Total liquid asset returns (comprising interest, realized and unrealized gains and losses, and translation&#13;
       adjustments) were $444 million in FY06 ($358 million in FY05 and $177 million in FY04), of which $378 million was&#13;
       attributable to the P0, P1 and P3 portfolios ($212 million in FY05 and $156 million in FY04), and $66 million was&#13;
       attributable to the P2 and P4 portfolios ($146 million in FY05 and $21 million in FY04). Currency translation gains on&#13;
       non-trading activities for FY06 were $6 million ($7 million loss in FY05 and $4 million gain in FY04).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Operational risk&#13;
&#13;
       IFC defines operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from events involving people, systems and processes.&#13;
       These include both internal and external events, whether caused by a lack of controls, documentation, or&#13;
       contingency planning, or by breakdowns in information systems, communications, physical safeguards, business&#13;
       continuity, supervision, transaction processing, or in the execution of legal, fiduciary, and agency responsibilities.&#13;
       As such, operational risk covers the risks emanating from the manner in which an entity is operated as opposed&#13;
       to the way it is financed.&#13;
&#13;
       Consistent with the Basel II Capital Adequacy guidelines, IFC is developing a matrix framework to analyze&#13;
       operational risk by identifying, for each area (people, systems and processes), which risks IFC will: (i) manage&#13;
       internally, as part of its ongoing business; (ii) alleviate through contingency planning; or (iii) insure externally,&#13;
       whether by subcontracting, outsourcing or hedging, including insurance.&#13;
&#13;
       Responsibility for the development of the framework for managing and monitoring operational risk now rests with&#13;
       the Business Risk Department, and for contingency planning for recovery from emergencies with the Controller's&#13;
       Department. In respect of insurable operational risk, IFC's Insurance Services Group performs insurance reviews&#13;
       to identify the risks and assess the adequacy of existing insurance policies and limits.&#13;
&#13;
       IFC seeks to mitigate the risks it manages internally by maintaining a comprehensive system of internal controls&#13;
       that is designed not only to identify the parameters of various risks but also to monitor and control those areas of&#13;
       particular concern. Key components of this effort are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Key components of operational risk management&#13;
               The Corporation has adopted the COSO1 control framework and a control self-assessment methodology&#13;
               to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal controls in people, systems and processes, and it has an&#13;
               ongoing program in place to cover all significant business operations. In addition, the COBIT2&#13;
               methodology is used to supplement the COSO review of the information technology function. The&#13;
               program includes compliance testing of key internal controls assuring the reliability of external financial&#13;
               reporting and has been applied to Donor Funded Operations as well.&#13;
               The Internal Audit Department of the World Bank Group performs ongoing independent review of the&#13;
               effectiveness of IFC's internal controls in selected key areas and functions.&#13;
               To promote data integrity, the Corporation has formulated a Data Management Policy. The policy is&#13;
               enforced by the Information Quality Group within the Controller's Department and through a network of&#13;
               Departmental Data Stewards.&#13;
               The Corporation has a New Products/Initiatives Assessment Group, with representation from key business&#13;
               and support functions, to ensure that processes and controls are in place to manage the risks in new&#13;
               products and initiatives before they are executed.&#13;
&#13;
          1. COSO refers to the Internal Control - Integrated Framework formulated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of&#13;
          the Treadway Commission, which was convened by the US Congress in response to the well-publicized irregularities that&#13;
          occurred in the financial sector in the United States during the late 1980s.&#13;
          2 .COBIT refers to Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology, first released in 1996, updated to the 3rd&#13;
          edition released in July 2000, sponsored by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA).&#13;

FY06 operational risk highlights&#13;
IFC continues to focus on its preparedness to react to an emergency situation that disrupts its normal operations.&#13;
During FY06, the Corporation has:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Added applications and capabilities to back-up facilities available for its key strategic financial and&#13;
      support systems and continued extensive testing thereof.&#13;
      As part of the IFC's avian flu contingency plans, all departments reinforced and extended home&#13;
      computing arrangements for essential staff.&#13;
      Extended the Emergency Management Team (EMT) concept to IBRD. The combined World Bank Group&#13;
      EMT conducted simulation exercises to test the adequacy of the avian flu contingency plan, and&#13;
      reinforced the roles and responsibilities of the EMT. The Corporation plans to extend the EMT structure to all&#13;
      regions during FY07.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation is continuing a multiyear effort to analyze and develop enhanced methodologies for measuring,&#13;
monitoring and managing operational risk in its key activities. During FY06, IFC has:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Continued a process-mapping exercise to identify potential areas of exposure to operational risk in its&#13;
      investment and advisory services processes and to provide a basis for quantifying potential risks; and&#13;
      Developed a beginning framework for IFC's strategic and operational risk functions within the newly&#13;
      established Business Risk Department; and&#13;
      Mapped out IFC's current risk management functions in order to further align these functions with the&#13;
      more regionalized business operations of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In FY06, IFC continued with its voluntary practice of conducting an annual assessment of its internal control over&#13;
external financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over external financial reporting&#13;
described in COSO. Based upon this assessment, Management believes that IFC maintained effective internal&#13;
control over external financial reporting presented in conformity with US GAAP, as of June 30, 2006. In light of&#13;
recent developments concerning changes in auditing standards by which the Corporation's external auditors&#13;
have historically provided an attestation to Management's assertion, Management did not seek an attestation&#13;
report from the Corporation's external auditors for FY06.&#13;
&#13;
Management has carried out an evaluation of internal controls over external financial reporting for the purposes&#13;
of determining if there were any changes made in internal controls during the year ended June 30, 2006, that&#13;
had materially affected, or would be reasonably likely to materially affect, IFC's internal control over external&#13;
financial reporting. As of June 30, 2006, no such significant changes occurred.&#13;
&#13;
Internal controls and procedures are those processes which are designed to ensure that information required to&#13;
be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate to allow timely decisions&#13;
regarding required disclosure by IFC. Management believes that these controls and procedures were effective&#13;
as of June 30, 2006.&#13;

       VI. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
       The Notes to the Corporation's FY06 financial statements contain a summary of the Corporation's significant&#13;
       accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Certain of these&#13;
       policies are considered to be "critical" to the portrayal of the Corporation's financial condition, since they require&#13;
       management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are&#13;
       inherently uncertain. These policies include: (i) determining the level of the allowance for losses in the loan&#13;
       portfolio; (ii) determining the level of impairment of equity investments; and (iii) determining the valuation of&#13;
       certain financial instruments with no quoted market prices. Additional information about these policies can be&#13;
       found in Notes A, C, O and P to the FY06 financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Reserve against losses on loans&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that&#13;
       the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. The reserve&#13;
       against losses for impaired loans reflects management's judgment of the present value of expected future cash&#13;
       flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. The reserve against losses for loans includes an estimate of&#13;
       probable losses on loans inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable. The reserve is established&#13;
       through periodic charges to income in the form of a provision for losses on loans. Loans written-off, as well as any&#13;
       subsequent recoveries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
&#13;
       The assessment of the adequacy of total reserves against losses for loans is highly dependent on management's&#13;
       judgment about factors such as geographical concentration, industry, regional and macroeconomic conditions,&#13;
       and historical trends. Due to the inherent limitation of any particular estimation technique, management utilizes&#13;
       three different and independent methods to provide estimates for the total loan loss reserve balance: (1) a&#13;
       simulation model, (2) country risk ratings and probability of crisis associated with those risks, and (3) a model of&#13;
       the Corporation's long-term historical loan portfolio experience. Changes in these estimates could have a direct&#13;
       impact on the provision and could result in a change in the reserve balance.&#13;
&#13;
       The reserve against losses on loans is separately reported in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of the&#13;
       Corporation's total loans. Increases or decreases in the reserve level are reported in the income statement as&#13;
       provision for losses or release of provision for losses on loans, and guarantees. The reserve against losses on loans&#13;
       relates only to the Client Services segment of the Corporation (see Note R to the FY06 financial statements for&#13;
       further discussion of the Corporation's business segments).&#13;
&#13;
       Equity impairment&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation assesses all equity investments for impairment each quarter. When impairment is identified and is&#13;
       deemed to be other than temporary, the equity investment is written down to its impaired value, which becomes&#13;
       the new cost basis in the equity investment. The Corporation has elected to assume that all impairments shall be&#13;
       deemed to be other than temporary. Impairment losses are not reversed for subsequent recoveries in value of&#13;
       the equity investment until it is sold.&#13;
&#13;
       Prior to March 31, 2005, the Corporation had carried reserves against losses on the equity investment portfolio.&#13;
       During the year ended June 30, 2005, the Corporation changed its process of estimating impairment on equity&#13;
       investments to adopt an impairment methodology based largely on fair value estimates. As a result, the&#13;
       Corporation recorded a change in carrying value of the equity investment portfolio. In this regard, the&#13;
       Corporation determined that all impairments and changes in carrying value were deemed to be other than&#13;
       temporary. This change in carrying value of the equity portfolio was reflected in net income from equity&#13;
       investments in the FY05 consolidated income statement and in equity investments in the consolidated balance&#13;
       sheet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Valuation of financial instruments with no quoted market prices&#13;
&#13;
As part of its compliance with SFAS No. 133, the Corporation reports at fair value all of its derivative instruments&#13;
and certain borrowings that the Corporation has designated as components of fair value hedges. In addition,&#13;
certain features in various loan agreements, equity investment agreements, and borrowing contracts contain&#13;
embedded derivatives that, for accounting purposes, are separately accounted as either derivative assets or&#13;
liabilities, including puts, caps, floors, and forwards. Few of these instruments have a ready market valuation.&#13;
Therefore, the fair values of the financial instruments with no quoted market prices are estimated using&#13;
sophisticated pricing models of the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Management makes&#13;
numerous assumptions in developing the pricing models, including the appropriate discount rates, interest rates,&#13;
and related volatility and expected movement in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in assumptions&#13;
could have a significant impact on the amounts reported as assets and liabilities and the related gains and losses&#13;
reported in the income statement. The fair value computations affect both the Client Services and Treasury&#13;
segments of the Corporation (see Note R to the FY06 financial statements for further discussion of the&#13;
Corporation's business segments).&#13;
&#13;
Additional information can be found in Notes A, O and P to the FY06 financial statements.&#13;

                                                                    hedging relationships&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The following paragraphs detail significant variances between FY06 and FY05, and FY05 and FY04, covering the&#13;
       periods included in the Corporation's FY06 financial statements. As disclosed in Note A to the Corporation's FY06&#13;
       financial statements, certain amounts in FY05 and FY04 have been reclassified to conform to the current year's&#13;
       presentation. Where applicable, the following paragraphs reflect reclassified prior year comparative&#13;
       information. Such reclassifications had no effect on operating income, net income or total assets.&#13;
&#13;
       FY06 versus FY05&#13;
&#13;
       Operating income&#13;
       The Corporation's income before expenditures for TAAS and PBG and net (losses) gains on non-trading financial&#13;
       instruments for FY06 was $1,499 million. Expenditures for TAAS for FY06 were $55 million, and expenditures for PBG&#13;
       for FY06 were $35 million, resulting in operating income for FY06 of $1,409 million. The continued strong operating&#13;
       performance in FY06, following from FY05's record year, was mainly attributable to continued significant equity&#13;
       income (principally capital gains and dividends) and a continued overall improvement in the quality of the loan&#13;
       and equity investment portfolio, as measured by portfolio impairment and portfolio risk levels, although at a&#13;
       slower pace than in FY05. The aggregate risk level within the portfolio has been reduced principally due to: (i)&#13;
       the successful restructuring or rescheduling of problem projects; (ii) the growth in the outstanding portfolio in new&#13;
       investments with better risk ratings; (iii) the write-off of investments with worse risk ratings than the average risk&#13;
       rating of the portfolio; and (iv) an overall improvement in country risk ratings. This improvement began during the&#13;
       latter stages of FY03 and continued through FY04, FY05 and FY06. The Corporation's liquid asset portfolios yielded&#13;
       strong positive contributions to the Corporation's operating income.&#13;
&#13;
       A more detailed analysis of the components of IFC's operating income follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Interest and financial fees from loans&#13;
       IFC's primary interest earning assets is its loan portfolio. Interest and financial fees from loans (including&#13;
       guarantee fees) for FY06 totaled $807 million, compared with $660 million in FY05, an increase of $147 million, or&#13;
       22%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PAGE 24  IFc annual report 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Interest income increased from $574 million in FY05 to $743 million in FY06, an increase of $169 million, or 29%. The&#13;
growth in the loan portfolio and the overall increase in average interest rates during FY06, when compared with&#13;
FY05, contributed $231 million, including net interest income on lending-related swaps, of the increase in interest&#13;
income. Recoveries of interest on loans being removed from non-accrual status, net of reversals of income on&#13;
loans being placed in nonaccrual status, were $20 million lower in FY06, compared to FY05. Income from the&#13;
Corporation's participation notes, over and above minimum contractual interest, was $25 million lower in FY06&#13;
than in FY05. Interest income from loans serving as collateral under secured borrowing arrangements totaled&#13;
$6 million in FY06 ($0 in FY05).&#13;
&#13;
Commitment and financial fees fell to $64 million in FY06 from $86 million in FY05, principally reflecting the change&#13;
in accounting principle concerning the deferral of net loan origination fees which offset the growth attributable&#13;
to strong commitments and disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
Charges on borrowings&#13;
The Corporation's charges on borrowings increased by $294 million, from $309 million in FY05 to $603 million in&#13;
FY06, largely reflecting the increased US dollar interest rate environment, when comparing FY06 and FY05.&#13;
Charges on borrowings in FY06 includes $6 million in respect of interest expense on secured borrowings ($0 in&#13;
FY05). The weighted average cost of the Corporation's borrowings outstanding from market sources, after the&#13;
effects of borrowing-related derivatives, rose during the year from 3.3% at June 30, 2005 to 4.9% at June 30, 2006.&#13;
The borrowings portfolio, net of borrowing-related derivatives and before the effects of SFAS No. 133, decreased&#13;
by $0.7 billion in FY06 from $16.0 billion at June 30, 2005, to $15.3 billion at June 30, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities comprises interest from time deposits and securities, net gains and&#13;
losses on trading activities, and a small currency translation effect. The liquid assets portfolio, net of derivatives&#13;
and securities lending activities, decreased from $13.3 billion at June 30, 2005, to $12.7 billion at June 30, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset income totaled $444 million in FY06 ($358 million in FY05). In a year when interest rates rose, the&#13;
Corporation has still been able to increase income. In FY06, all of IFC's liquid asset portfolios outperformed their&#13;
respective benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
The majority of liquid asset income in FY06 was attributable to the Corporation's P1 portfolio, which is actively&#13;
managed against a variable rate benchmark. This portfolio generated income of $288 million in FY06, a return of&#13;
5.20% ($162 million in FY05, a return of 2.24%). The P3 portfolio, managed against the same variable rate target&#13;
returned $43 million in FY06, $17 million higher than in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
The P2 and P4 portfolios delivered 156 and 54 basis points of excess return versus their Lehman Brothers Intermediate&#13;
US Treasury Index. With rates on the rise, the benchmark actually lost 0.19% in FY06. The P2 and P4 portfolios&#13;
returned $64 million (1.38%) and $2 million (0.35%) in FY06, respectively, as compared to $130 million (3.73%) and $16&#13;
million (4.51%) in FY05. The positive performance of the P2 portfolio was achieved due to directional and yield curve&#13;
strategies designed specifically to take advantage of the tightening of monetary policy in the United States, Europe&#13;
and Japan.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation's holdings of US, European and Japanese inflation-indexed securities whose income varies with&#13;
inflation in the P1and P2 portfolios was a significant contributor to the outperformance relative to benchmark.&#13;
&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Income from the equity investment portfolio decreased by $137 million from $1,365 million in FY05 to $1,228 million&#13;
in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation generated realized capital gains on equity sales, including recoveries of previously written-off&#13;
equity investments and net of losses on sales of equity investments, for FY06 of $928 million, as compared with&#13;
$723 million for FY05, an increase of $205 million. Realized capital gains on equity sales from 14 investments&#13;
comprised 50% of the FY06 gains (before write-offs and losses on sales), compared to 19 investments comprising&#13;
71% of the FY05 gains. IFC continued to take advantage of buoyant markets throughout most of FY06 to sell&#13;
equities and take some limited gains in investments where IFC's developmental role was complete, and where&#13;
pre-determined sales trigger levels had been met.&#13;
&#13;
Dividend income was also significantly higher in FY06 at $327 million, as compared with $258 million in FY05.&#13;
Consistent with FY05, a significant amount of IFC's dividend income in FY06 was due to returns on the&#13;
Corporation's joint ventures in the oil, gas and mining sectors accounted for under the cost recovery method,&#13;
which totaled $86 million in FY06, as compared with $106 million in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                     volume 2PAGE 25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       Income from LLPs, certain LLCs, and other investments accounted for under the equity method totaled $56&#13;
       million in FY06 ($191 million in FY05).&#13;
&#13;
       Provisions for losses on loans and guarantees&#13;
       As noted above, the quality of the Corporation's loan portfolio continued to improve during FY06 although at a&#13;
       slower pace than in FY05 and FY04. IFC recorded a small provision for losses on loans and guarantees of $15&#13;
       million in FY06, including $5 million in respect of guarantees. On June 30, 2006, the Corporation's total reserves&#13;
       against losses on loans were 8.3% of the disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio excluding unamortized&#13;
       deferred net loan origination fees and fair value adjustments for loans in qualifying hedge relationships (9.9% at&#13;
       June 30, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
       Other income&#13;
       Other income of $115 million for FY06 was $36 million higher than in FY05 ($79 million).&#13;
&#13;
       Other expenses&#13;
       Administrative expenses (the principal component of other expenses) increased by 8% from $403 million in FY05&#13;
       to $436 million in FY06, principally reflecting the Corporation's higher budget authority in FY06 when compared to&#13;
       FY05. Administrative expenses include the grossing-up effect of certain revenues and expenses attributable to&#13;
       the Corporation's reimbursable program and jeopardy projects ($37 million in FY06, as compared with $33 million&#13;
       in FY05). The Corporation recorded expense from pension and other postretirement benefit plans in FY06 of $28&#13;
       million, as compared with $14 million in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Net income&#13;
       As more fully disclosed in Notes A, O and P to the Corporation's FY06 financial statements, the Corporation has&#13;
       designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing activities and its lending activities as fair value hedges.&#13;
       The Corporation generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial&#13;
       instruments hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features.&#13;
       However, differing valuation methodologies are applied to the derivative and the hedged financial instrument,&#13;
       as prescribed by SFAS No. 133. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded in net&#13;
       (losses) gains on non-trading financial instruments, in net income.&#13;
&#13;
       The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income in FY06 and FY05 can be summarized as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    FY06              FY05&#13;
         Operating income                                                                     $    1,409         $    1,953&#13;
         SFAS No. 133 adjustments:&#13;
         Net (losses) gains on non-trading financial instruments                                    (131)                62&#13;
         Net income                                                                           $    1,278         $    2,015&#13;
&#13;
       Net (losses) gains on non-trading financial instruments largely comprises the difference between the change in&#13;
       fair value of derivative instruments and the change in fair value of the hedged item under designated hedging&#13;
       relationships.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       FY05 versus FY04&#13;
&#13;
       Operating income&#13;
       The Corporation's income before expenditures for TAAS and net (losses) gains on non-trading financial&#13;
       instruments for FY05 was $1,991 million. Expenditures for TAAS for FY05 were $38 million, resulting in income after&#13;
       expenditures for TAAS (operating income) for FY05 of $1,953 million, a third consecutive record year. The&#13;
       improvement was mainly attributable to significant equity income (principally capital gains) and a continued&#13;
       overall improvement in the quality of the loan and equity investment portfolio, as measured by portfolio&#13;
       impairment and portfolio risk levels. The aggregate risk level within the portfolio had been reduced principally&#13;
       due to: (i) the successful restructuring or rescheduling of problem projects; (ii) the growth in the outstanding&#13;
       portfolio in new investments with better risk ratings; (iii) the write-off of investments with worse risk ratings than the&#13;
       average risk rating of the portfolio; and (iv) an overall improvement in country risk ratings. This improvement&#13;
       began during the latter stages of FY03 and continued through FY04 and FY05. The Corporation's liquid asset&#13;
       portfolios yielded strong positive contributions to the Corporation's operating income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
A more detailed analysis of the components of IFC's operating income follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interest and financial fees from loans&#13;
Interest and financial fees from loans (including guarantee fees) for FY05 totaled $660 million, compared with&#13;
$518 million in FY04, an increase of $142 million, or 27%. Interest income increased from $449 million in FY04 to $574&#13;
million in FY05. The growth in the loan portfolio and the overall increase in average interest rates during FY05,&#13;
when compared with FY04, contributed $118 million, net of interest expense on lending-related swaps, of the&#13;
increase in interest income. Recoveries of interest on loans being removed from non-accrual status, net of&#13;
reversals of income on loans being placed in nonaccrual status, were $8 million lower in FY05, compared to FY04,&#13;
at $31 million in FY05 ($39 million in FY04). Income from the Corporation's participation notes, over and above&#13;
minimum contractual interest, totaled $55 million in FY05 ($40 million in FY04). Commitment and financial fees&#13;
also grew to $86 million in FY05 from $69 million in FY04, reflecting strong commitments and disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
Charges on borrowings&#13;
The Corporation's charges on borrowings increased by $168 million, from $141 million in FY04 to $309 million in&#13;
FY05, largely reflecting the increased US dollar interest rate environment, when comparing FY05 and FY04. As the&#13;
Corporation's borrowings generally reprice every six months, the effect of the significant rise in the interest rate&#13;
environment in the fourth quarter of FY04 adversely impacted FY05 charges on borrowings. The weighted&#13;
average cost of the Corporation's borrowings outstanding from market sources, after the effects of borrowing-&#13;
related derivatives, rose during the year from 1.0% at June 30, 2004 to 3.3% at June 30, 2005. The borrowings&#13;
portfolio, net of borrowing-related derivatives and before the effects of SFAS No. 133, decreased by $0.4 billion in&#13;
FY05 from $16.4 billion at June 30, 2004, to $16.0 billion at June 30, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities comprises interest from time deposits and securities, net gains and&#13;
losses on trading activities, and a small currency translation effect. The liquid assets portfolio, net of derivatives&#13;
and securities lending activities, increased from $13.1 billion at June 30, 2004, to $13.3 billion at June 30, 2005.&#13;
Liquid asset returns totaled $358 million in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Income from the equity investment portfolio increased by $707 million from $658 million in FY04 to $1,365 million in&#13;
FY05.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation generated realized capital gains on equity sales for FY05 of $723 million, as compared with $381&#13;
million for FY04, an increase of $342 million. Realized capital gains on equity sales from 19 investments comprised&#13;
71% of the FY05 gains, compared to seven investments comprising 64% of the FY04 gains. IFC continued to take&#13;
advantage of buoyant markets to sell equities and take some limited gains in investments where IFC's&#13;
developmental role was complete, and where pre-determined sales trigger levels had been met.&#13;
&#13;
Dividend income was also significantly higher in FY05 at $258 million, as compared with $207 million in FY04.&#13;
Consistent with FY04, a significant amount of IFC's dividend income in FY05 was due to returns on the&#13;
Corporation's joint ventures in the oil, gas and mining sectors, which totaled $106 million in FY05, as compared&#13;
with $65 million in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
Beginning in FY05, the Corporation's investments in its LLPs and certain LLCs are accounted for under the equity&#13;
method. As a result, IFC's FY05 income from equity investments includes income from its investments in LLPs and&#13;
certain LLCs in the amount of $191 million ($0 in FY04).&#13;
&#13;
Release of provisions for losses on loans and guarantees&#13;
As noted above, the quality of the Corporation's investment portfolio improved during FY05, continuing the trend&#13;
noted in FY03 and FY04. As a result, IFC recorded a release of provisions for losses on loans and guarantees of&#13;
$261 million in FY05, including a release of $3 million in respect of guarantees, a significant improvement over FY04&#13;
when the Corporation recorded a release of $103 million ($14 million in respect of guarantees). On June 30, 2005,&#13;
the Corporation's total reserves against losses on loans were 9.9% of the disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio&#13;
(14.0% at June 30, 2004).&#13;
&#13;
Other income&#13;
Other income of $79 million for FY05 was substantially unchanged from FY04.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                     volume 2PAGE 27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       Other expenses&#13;
       Administrative expenses (the principal component of other expenses) increased by 12% from $360 million in FY04&#13;
       to $403 million in FY05, principally reflecting the Corporation's higher budget authority in FY05 when compared to&#13;
       FY04. Administrative expenses include the grossing-up effect of certain revenues and expenses attributable to&#13;
       the Corporation's reimbursable program and jeopardy projects ($33 million in FY05, as compared with $34 million&#13;
       in FY04). The Corporation recorded expense from pension and other postretirement benefit plans in FY05 of $14&#13;
       million, as compared with $19 million in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Net income&#13;
       As more fully disclosed in Notes A, O and P to the Corporation's FY06 financial statements, the Corporation has&#13;
       designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing activities and its lending activities as fair value hedges.&#13;
       The Corporation generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial&#13;
       instruments hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features.&#13;
       However, differing valuation methodologies are applied to the derivative and the hedged&#13;
       financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships&#13;
       is recorded in net (losses) gains on non-trading financial instruments, in net income.&#13;
&#13;
       The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income in FY05 and FY04 can be summarized as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               FY05             FY04&#13;
         Operating income                                                                 $   1,953          $    982&#13;
         SFAS No. 133 adjustments:&#13;

         Net income                                                                       $   2,015          $    993&#13;
&#13;
       Net gains on non-trading financial instruments largely comprises the difference between the change in fair value&#13;
       of derivative instruments and the change in fair value of the hedged item under designated hedging&#13;
       relationships.&#13;

VIII. GOVERNANCE&#13;
&#13;
Management Changes&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Assaad Jabre was Acting Executive Vice President (EVP) since the retirement of the Corporation's EVP,&#13;
Mr. Peter Woicke effective January 31, 2005. Effective January 15, 2006, Mr. Lars H. Thunell was appointed EVP of&#13;
the Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Declan Duff was appointed Vice President, Industries effective May 15, 2006. Ms. Farida Khambata was&#13;
appointed Regional Vice President for Asia and Latin America effective July 1, 2006. Mr. Edward Nassim was&#13;
appointed Regional Vice President for Europe, Africa, and the Middle East effective July 1,2006.&#13;
&#13;
Board of Directors&#13;
&#13;
In accordance with its Articles of Agreement, members of IFC's Board are appointed or elected by their member&#13;
governments. These Directors are neither officers nor staff of IFC. The President is the only management member&#13;
of the Board, serving as a non-voting member and as Chairman of the Board. The Board has established several&#13;
Committees including:&#13;
&#13;
         Committee on Development Effectiveness&#13;
         Audit Committee&#13;
         Budget Committee&#13;
         Personnel Committee&#13;
         Ethics Committee&#13;
         Committee on Governance and Administrative Matters&#13;
&#13;
The Board and its Committees function in continuous session at the principal offices of the World Bank Group, as&#13;
business requires. Each Committee's terms of reference establish its respective roles and responsibilities. As&#13;
Committees do not vote on issues, their role is primarily to serve the full Board in discharging its responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
Audit Committee&#13;
&#13;
Membership&#13;
The Audit Committee consists of eight members of the Board. Membership on the Committee is determined by&#13;
the Board, based upon nominations by the Chairman of the Board, following informal consultation with the&#13;
Directors. In addition, membership of the Committee is expected to reflect the economic and geographic&#13;
diversity of IFC's member countries. Other relevant selection criteria include seniority, continuity and relevant&#13;
experience. Some or all of the responsibilities of individual Committee members are performed by their alternates&#13;
or advisors. Generally, Committee members are appointed for a two-year term; reappointment to a second&#13;
term, when possible, is desirable for continuity. Audit Committee meetings are generally open to any members of&#13;
the Board who may wish to attend, and non-Committee members of the Board may participate in the&#13;
discussion. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee may speak in that capacity at meetings of the&#13;
Board with respect to discussions held in the Audit Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Key responsibilities&#13;
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board to assist it in the oversight and assessment of IFC's finances and&#13;
accounting, including the effectiveness of financial policies, the integrity of financial statements, the system of&#13;
internal controls regarding finance, accounting and ethics (including fraud and corruption), and financial and&#13;
operational risks. The Audit Committee also has the responsibility for reviewing the performance and&#13;
recommending to the Board the appointment of the external auditor, as well as monitoring the independence of&#13;
the external auditor and meeting with it in executive session. The Audit Committee participates in oversight of&#13;
the internal audit function, including reviewing the responsibilities, staffing and the effectiveness of internal audit.&#13;
The Committee also reviews the annual internal audit plan and meets with the Auditor General in executive&#13;
session. In the execution of its role, the Committee discusses with management, the external auditors, and the&#13;
internal auditors financial issues and policies which have a bearing on the Corporation's financial position and&#13;
risk-bearing capacity. The Audit Committee monitors the evolution of developments in corporate governance&#13;
and the role of audit committees on an ongoing basis and revised its terms of reference in FY04.&#13;

       Communications&#13;
       The Audit Committee communicates regularly with the Board through distribution of the following:&#13;
&#13;
         The minutes of its meetings.&#13;
         Reports of the Audit Committee prepared by the Chairman, which document discussions held. These reports&#13;
         are distributed to the Directors, Alternates, World Bank Group Senior Management and Vice Presidents of IFC.&#13;
         "Statement(s) of the Chairman" and statements issued by other members of the Committee.&#13;
         The Annual Report to the Board, which provides an overview of the main issues addressed by the Audit&#13;
         Committee over the year.&#13;
&#13;
       The Audit Committee's communications with the external auditor are described in the Auditor Independence&#13;
       section, below.&#13;
&#13;
       Executive sessions&#13;
       Members of the Audit Committee may convene in executive session at any time, without management present.&#13;
       Under the Committee's terms of reference, it meets separately in executive session with the external and internal&#13;
       auditors.&#13;
&#13;
       Access to outside resources and to management&#13;
       Throughout the year, the Audit Committee receives a large volume of information, which supports the&#13;
       preparation of the financial statements. The Audit Committee meets both formally and informally throughout the&#13;
       year to discuss financial and accounting matters. Directors have complete access to the management of the&#13;
       Corporation. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management the quarterly and annual financial&#13;
       statements. The Committee also reviews with the external auditor the financial statements prior to their&#13;
       publication and recommends them for approval to the Board of Directors.&#13;
&#13;
       The Audit Committee has the capacity, under exceptional circumstances, to obtain advice and assistance from&#13;
       outside legal, accounting or other advisors as deemed appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
       Code of Ethics&#13;
&#13;
       The World Bank Group strives to foster and maintain a positive work environment that supports the ethical&#13;
       behavior of its staff. To facilitate this effort, the World Bank Group has a Code of Professional Ethics in place. The&#13;
       Code (Code of Professional Ethics Â­ Living our Values) applies to all staff (including managers, consultants, and&#13;
       temporary employees) worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
       The Code is available in nine languages on the World Bank Group's Web site, www.worldbank.org. Staff relations,&#13;
       conflicts of interest, and operational issues, including the accuracy of books and records, are key elements of the&#13;
       Code.&#13;
&#13;
       In addition to the Code, an essential element of appropriate conduct is compliance with the obligations embodied&#13;
       in the Principles of Staff Employment, Staff Rules, and Administrative Rules, the violation of which may result in&#13;
       disciplinary action. In accordance with the Staff Rules, senior managers must complete a confidential financial&#13;
       disclosure instrument with the Office of Ethics and Business Conduct.&#13;
&#13;
       Guidance for staff is also provided through programs, training materials, and other resources. Managers are&#13;
       responsible for ensuring that internal systems, policies, and procedures are consistently aligned with the World&#13;
       Bank Group's ethical goals. In support of its efforts on ethics, the World Bank offers a variety of methods for&#13;
       informing staff of these resources. Many of these efforts are headed by the following groups:&#13;
         The Office of Ethics and Business Conduct provides leadership, management and oversight for the World Bank&#13;
         Group's ethics infrastructure including the Ethics Help Line, a consolidated conflicts of interest disclosure/&#13;
         resolution system, financial disclosure, ongoing training to both internal and external audiences, and&#13;
         communication resources.&#13;
         The Department of Institutional Integrity is charged with investigating allegations of fraud and corruption within&#13;
         the World Bank Group. The Department also investigates allegations of misconduct by World Bank Group staff,&#13;
         and trains and educates staff and clients in detecting and reporting fraud and corruption in World Bank&#13;
         Group-funded projects. The Department reports directly to the President and is composed of professionals from&#13;
         a range of disciplines including financial analysts, researchers, investigators, lawyers, prosecutors, forensic&#13;
         accountants, and World Bank Group staff with operational experience.&#13;

The World Bank Group has in place procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received&#13;
regarding accounting, internal controls and auditing matters.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Group offers both the Ethics Help Line and a Fraud and Corruption hotline run by an outside firm&#13;
staffed by trained specialists. This third-party service offers numerous methods of communication in addition to a&#13;
tollfree hotline in countries where access to telecommunications may be limited. In addition, there are other&#13;
methods by which the Department of Institutional Integrity may receive allegations, including directly by email,&#13;
anonymously, or through confidential submission through its Web site, as well as the postal service and telephone.&#13;
&#13;
Auditor Independence&#13;
&#13;
In FY03, the Board adopted a set of principles applicable to the appointment of the external auditor for IFC. Key&#13;
features of those principles include:&#13;
&#13;
  Prohibition of the external auditor from the provision of all non audit-related services;&#13;
  All audit-related services must be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Board, upon recommendation&#13;
  of the Audit Committee;&#13;
  Mandatory rebidding of the external audit contract every five years;&#13;
  Prohibition of any firm serving as external auditor for more than two consecutive five-year terms;&#13;
  Mandatory rotation of the senior partner after five years; and&#13;
  An evaluation of the performance of the external auditor at the mid-point of the five year term.&#13;
&#13;
In FY04, IFC's external auditor, Deloitte and Touche LLP, began a new five-year term and will have served eleven&#13;
years as external auditor upon completion of that term, pursuant to a one-time grandfathered exemption from&#13;
the above-referenced ten-year limit. Even within a five-year term the service of the external auditors is subject to&#13;
recommendation by the Audit Committee for annual reappointment and approval of a resolution by the Board.&#13;
&#13;
As a standard practice, the external auditor is present as an observer at virtually all Audit Committee meetings&#13;
and is frequently asked to present its perspective on issues. In addition, the Audit Committee meets periodically&#13;
with the external auditor in private session without management present. Communication between the external&#13;
auditor and the Audit Committee is ongoing, as frequently as is deemed necessary by either party. IFC's external&#13;
auditors follow the communication requirements with audit committees set out under U.S. generally accepted&#13;
auditing standards. In keeping with these standards, significant formal communications include:&#13;
&#13;
  Quarterly and annual financial statement reporting;&#13;
  Annual appointment of the external auditors;&#13;
  Presentation of the external audit plan;&#13;
  Presentation of control recommendations and discussion of the COSO attestation and report; and&#13;
  Presentation of a statement regarding independence.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to Committee meetings, individual members of the Audit Committee have independent access to&#13;
the external auditor.&#13;

&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
&#13;
The International Finance Corporation (IFC or the Corporation), an international organization, was established in 1956 to further&#13;
economic development in its member countries by encouraging the growth of private enterprise. The Corporation is a member of&#13;
the World Bank Group, which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International&#13;
Development Association (IDA), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The Corporation's activities are closely&#13;
coordinated with and complement the overall development objectives of the other World Bank Group institutions.                       The&#13;
Corporation, together with private investors, assists in financing the establishment, improvement, and expansion of private sector&#13;
enterprises by making loans and equity investments where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms.&#13;
The Corporation's share capital is provided by its member countries. It raises most of the funds for its investment activities through&#13;
the issuance of notes, bonds, and other debt securities in the international capital markets. The Corporation also plays a catalytic&#13;
role in mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through loan&#13;
participations, underwritings, and guarantees. In addition to project finance and resource mobilization, the Corporation offers an&#13;
array of financial and technical advisory services to private businesses in the developing world to increase their chances of success.&#13;
 It also advises governments on how to create an environment hospitable to the growth of private enterprise and foreign&#13;
investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE A Â­ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Corporation and four Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)&#13;
(see Note W). The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform with accounting principles generally accepted in&#13;
the United States of America (US GAAP). On August 7, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved these&#13;
consolidated financial statements for issue.&#13;
&#13;
Consolidated financial statements presentation - Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current&#13;
year's presentation.&#13;
&#13;
Use of estimates - The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and&#13;
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of&#13;
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. Actual&#13;
results could differ from these estimates. A significant degree of judgment has been used in the determination of: the adequacy of&#13;
the reserve against losses on loans and impairment of equity investments; estimated fair values of all derivative instruments and&#13;
related financial instruments in qualifying hedging relationships; and net periodic pension income. There are inherent risks and&#13;
uncertainties related to the Corporation's operations. The possibility exists that changing economic conditions could have an&#13;
adverse effect on the financial position of the Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation uses internal models to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments and the aggregate&#13;
level of the reserve against losses on loans and impairment of equity investments. The Corporation undertakes continuous review&#13;
and respecification of these models with the objective of refining its estimates, consistent with evolving best market practices.&#13;
Changes in estimates resulting from refinements in the assumptions and methodologies incorporated in the models are reflected in&#13;
net income in the period in which the enhanced models are first applied.&#13;
&#13;
Translation of currencies - Assets and liabilities not denominated in United States dollars (US dollars or $), other than disbursed equity&#13;
investments, are expressed in US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005. Disbursed equity&#13;
investments are expressed in US dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at the time of disbursement. Income and expenses are&#13;
translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction. Translation gains and losses are credited or charged to&#13;
income.&#13;
&#13;
Loans - The Corporation originates loans to facilitate project finance, restructuring, refinancing, corporate finance, and/or&#13;
developmental impact. Loans are recorded as assets when disbursed. Loans are carried at the principal amounts outstanding.&#13;
Where loans are part of a designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying value is adjusted for&#13;
changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. These adjustments are reported in net gains and losses on non-trading&#13;
financial instruments in the consolidated income statement. It is the Corporation's practice to obtain collateral security such as, but&#13;
not limited to, mortgages and third-party guarantees.&#13;
&#13;
Revenue recognition on loans - Interest income and commitment fees on loans are recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
Beginning in the year ended June 30, 2006, the Corporation began amortizing net loan origination costs and fees over the&#13;
estimated life of the originated loan to which the fees relate. Prior to the year ended June 30, 2006, loan origination costs were&#13;
expensed as incurred, and loan origination fees were recognized in income when received. The net of loan origination fees and&#13;
loan origination costs was considered insignificant. All other fees are recorded as income when received in freely convertible&#13;
currencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                volume 2  PAGE 41&#13;

                                              INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past&#13;
      due more than 60 days unless management anticipates that collection of interest will occur in the near future. Any interest accrued&#13;
      on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is reversed out of income and is thereafter recognized as income only when the actual&#13;
      payment is received. Interest not previously recognized but capitalized as part of a debt restructuring is recorded as deferred&#13;
      income, included in the consolidated balance sheet in payables and other liabilities, and credited to income only when the&#13;
      related principal is received. Such capitalized interest is considered in the computation of the reserve against losses on loans and&#13;
      equity investments in the consolidated balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
      Reserve against losses on loans - The Corporation recognizes portfolio impairment on loans in the consolidated balance sheet&#13;
      through the reserve against losses on loans, recording a provision or release of provision for losses on loans in net income on a&#13;
      quarterly basis, which increases or decreases the reserve against losses on loans.&#13;
&#13;
      Management determines the aggregate level of the reserve against losses on loans, taking into account established guidelines and&#13;
      its assessment of recent portfolio quality trends. The guidelines comprise simulation techniques, internal country risk ratings and the&#13;
      impairment potential of the loan portfolio based on the Corporation's historical portfolio write-off and loss reserve experience on&#13;
      mature investments.&#13;
&#13;
      The reserve against losses on loans reflects estimates of both probable losses already identified and probable losses inherent in the&#13;
      portfolio but not specifically identifiable. The determination of identified probable losses represents management's judgment of the&#13;
      creditworthiness of the borrower and is established through review of individual loans undertaken on a quarterly basis. The&#13;
      Corporation considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will&#13;
      be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. Unidentified probable losses are the aggregate&#13;
      probable losses over a one-year risk horizon, in excess of identified probable losses. The risks inherent in the portfolio that are&#13;
      considered in determining unidentified probable losses are those proven to exist by past experience and include: country systemic&#13;
      risk; the risk of correlation or contagion of losses between markets; uninsured and uninsurable risks; nonperformance under&#13;
      guarantees and support agreements; and opacity of, or misrepresentation in, financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
      Loans are written-off when the Corporation has exhausted all possible means of recovery, by reducing the reserve against losses on&#13;
      loans. Such reductions in the reserve are offset by recoveries associated with previously written-off loans.&#13;
&#13;
      Equity investments - The Corporation invests for current income, capital appreciation, developmental impact, or all three; the&#13;
      Corporation does not seek to take operational, controlling, or strategic equity positions within its investees. Equity investments are&#13;
      acquired through direct ownership of equity instruments of investees, as a limited partner in limited liability partnerships (LLPs) and&#13;
      limited liability companies (LLCs), and/or as an investor in a private equity fund.&#13;
&#13;
      Revenue recognition on equity investments - Direct equity investments in which the Corporation does not have significant influence&#13;
      and certain investments in investment companies are carried at cost less impairment. The Corporation's investments in companies&#13;
      where it has significant influence and certain investments in LLPs and LLCs that maintain specific ownership accounts are&#13;
      accounted for under the equity method. The Corporation's investments in certain private equity funds in which IFC is deemed to&#13;
      be the Primary Beneficiary of a VIE as the presumption of control by the fund manager or the general partner has been overcome&#13;
      are fully consolidated into the Corporation's books. Certain equity investments, for which recovery of invested capital is uncertain,&#13;
      are accounted for under the cost recovery method, such that receipts of freely convertible currencies are first applied to recovery&#13;
      of invested capital and then to capital gains. The cost recovery method is principally applied to the Corporation's investment in its&#13;
      oil and gas unincorporated joint ventures (UJVs). Conditional asset retirement obligations related to investments in UJVs are&#13;
      recorded when the fair value of the obligations can be reasonably estimated. The obligations are capitalized and systemically&#13;
      amortized over the estimated economic useful lives.&#13;
&#13;
      Dividends and profit participations received on cost method equity investments are generally recorded as income when received&#13;
      in freely convertible currencies. Realized capital gains on the sale or redemption of equity investments are measured against the&#13;
      average cost of the investments sold and are generally recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies or&#13;
      securities, which are readily convertible into freely convertible currencies. Capital losses are recognized when incurred.&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation enters into put and call option agreements in connection with equity investments; these are accounted for in&#13;
      accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133.&#13;
&#13;
      Impairment of equity investments - Equity investments are assessed for impairment each quarter. When an impairment is identified&#13;
      and is deemed to be other than temporary, the equity investment is written down to the impaired value, which becomes the new&#13;
      cost basis in the equity investment. Impairment losses are not reversed for subsequent recoveries in value of the equity investment&#13;
      until it is sold.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Guarantees - The Corporation extends financial guarantee facilities to its clients to provide credit enhancement for their debt&#13;
securities and trade obligations. Beginning in the year ended June 30, 2001, the Corporation began offering partial credit&#13;
guarantees to clients covering, on a risk-sharing basis, client obligations on bonds and/or loans. Under the terms of the Corporation's&#13;
guarantees, the Corporation agrees to assume responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the event of default by the client&#13;
(i.e., failure to pay when payment is due). Guarantees are regarded as issued when the Corporation commits to the guarantee.&#13;
Guarantees are regarded as outstanding when the underlying financial obligation of the client is incurred, and this date is&#13;
considered to be the "inception" of the guarantee. Guarantees are regarded as called when the Corporation's obligation under&#13;
the guarantee has been invoked. There are two liabilities associated with the guarantees: (1) the stand-ready obligation to perform&#13;
and (2) the contingent liability. The stand-ready obligation to perform is recognized at the outstanding date unless a contingent&#13;
liability exists at that time or is expected to exist in the near term. The contingent liability associated with the financial guarantees is&#13;
recognized when it is probable the guarantee will be called and when the amount of guarantee called can be reasonably&#13;
estimated. All liabilities associated with guarantees are included in payables and other liabilities, and the receivables are included&#13;
in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. When the guarantees are called, the amount disbursed is recorded as a new&#13;
loan, and specific reserves are established, based on the estimated probable loss. These reserves are included in the reserve&#13;
against losses on loans on the consolidated balance sheet. Guarantee fees are recorded in income as the stand-ready obligation&#13;
to perform is fulfilled. Commitment fees on guarantees are recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Designations of retained earnings - In the year ended June 30, 2004, IFC established a funding mechanism for technical assistance&#13;
and advisory services (TAAS) through a designation of retained earnings. In the year ended June 30, 2005, the Corporation&#13;
established a funding mechanism for performance-based grants (PBG) through a designation of retained earnings. Further, in the&#13;
year ended June 30, 2006, the Corporation also designated retained earnings for grants to IDA for use by IDA in the provision of&#13;
grants to further IFC's mandates in certain IDA member countries. Total designations of retained earnings for TAAS, PBG, and&#13;
grants to IDA are determined based on the Corporation's annual income before expenditures for TAAS, expenditures for PBG, and&#13;
net (losses) gains on non-trading financial instruments in excess of $150 million, and contemplating the financial capacity and&#13;
priorities of the Corporation. Expenditures for TAAS, PBG, and grants to IDA are recorded as expenses in the Corporation's&#13;
consolidated income statement in the year in which they occur, also having the effect of reducing the respective designated&#13;
retained earnings for such purposes.&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures are deemed to have occurred when IFC has ceded control of the funds to the recipient. If the recipient organization&#13;
is deemed, in accordance with US GAAP, to be controlled by IFC, the expenditure is deemed to have occurred only when the&#13;
recipient organization expends the funds to a non-related party. On occasion, recipient organizations which are deemed to be&#13;
controlled by the Corporation will acquire certain investment assets other than cash. These investments have had no material&#13;
impact on the Corporation's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In such cases, the Corporation includes those&#13;
assets on its consolidated balance sheet, where they remain until the recipient organization disposes of or transfers the asset or the&#13;
Corporation is deemed to no longer be in control of the recipient organization.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolio - The Corporation's liquid funds are invested in government and agency obligations, time deposits and asset-&#13;
backed securities. Government and agency obligations include long and short positions in highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes,&#13;
bills, and other obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities including&#13;
government agencies and instrumentalities or by multilateral organizations.              The liquid asset portfolio, as defined by the&#13;
Corporation, consists of: time deposits and securities; related derivative instruments; securities purchased under resale agreements,&#13;
securities sold under repurchase agreements and payable for cash collateral received; receivables from sales of securities and&#13;
payables for purchases of securities; and related accrued income and charges.&#13;
&#13;
Trading securities are carried at fair value with any changes in fair value reported in income from liquid asset trading activities.&#13;
Interest on securities and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are also reported in income from liquid asset trading&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation classifies due from banks and time deposits (collectively, cash and cash equivalents) as an element of liquidity in&#13;
the statement of consolidated cash flows because they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash within 90 days.&#13;
&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements - Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells securities and simultaneously&#13;
agrees to repurchase the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Resale agreements are contracts under which&#13;
a party purchases securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price.&#13;
&#13;
It is the Corporation's policy to take possession of securities purchased under resale agreements, which are primarily liquid&#13;
government securities. The market value of these securities is monitored and, within parameters defined in the agreements,&#13;
additional collateral is obtained when their value declines. The Corporation also monitors its exposure with respect to securities sold&#13;
under repurchase agreements and, in accordance with the terms of the agreements, requests the return of excess securities held&#13;
by the counterparty when their value increases.&#13;
&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amount at&#13;
which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold&#13;
under agreements to repurchase and securities payable for cash collateral received are recorded at fair value.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
      Borrowings - To diversify its access to funding and reduce its borrowing costs, the Corporation borrows in a variety of currencies and&#13;
      uses a number of borrowing structures, including foreign exchange rate-linked, inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes.&#13;
      Generally, the Corporation simultaneously converts such borrowings into variable rate US dollar borrowings through the use of&#13;
      currency and interest rate swap transactions. Under certain outstanding borrowing agreements, the Corporation is not permitted to&#13;
      mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its assets (other than purchase money security interests) without extending equivalent&#13;
      security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
      Borrowings are recorded at the amount repayable at maturity, adjusted for unamortized premium and unaccreted discount.&#13;
      Where borrowings are part of a designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying amount is adjusted&#13;
      for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. Adjustments for changes in fair value attributable to hedged risks are&#13;
      reported in net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments in the consolidated income statement. Interest on borrowings&#13;
      and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in charges on borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
      Risk management, derivative instruments, and hedge accounting - The Corporation enters into transactions in various derivative&#13;
      instruments for financial risk management purposes in connection with its principal business activities, including lending, client risk&#13;
      management, borrowing, liquid asset portfolio management and asset and liability management. The Corporation does not use&#13;
      derivatives for speculative, marketing or merchandising purposes.&#13;
&#13;
      All derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as derivative assets or derivative liabilities.&#13;
      Where they are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, certain derivative instruments embedded in loans, equity&#13;
      investments, and market borrowing transactions entered into on or after January 1, 1999, are bifurcated from the host contract&#13;
      and recorded at fair value as derivative assets and liabilities. The value at inception of such embedded derivatives is excluded&#13;
      from the carrying value of the host contracts on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in fair values of derivative instruments&#13;
      used in liquid asset portfolio management activities are recorded in income from liquid asset trading activities. Changes in fair&#13;
      values of derivative instruments other than those used in liquid asset portfolio management activities are recorded in net (losses)&#13;
      gains on non-trading financial instruments.&#13;
&#13;
      Subject to certain specific qualifying conditions in SFAS No. 133, a derivative instrument may be designated either as a hedge of the&#13;
      fair value of an asset or liability (fair value hedge), or as a hedge of the variability of cash flows of an asset or liability or forecasted&#13;
      transaction (cash flow hedge). For a derivative instrument qualifying as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the&#13;
      derivative instrument are reported in net income, together with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that are&#13;
      attributable to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument qualifying as a cash flow hedge, fair value gains or losses&#13;
      associated with the risk being hedged are reported in other comprehensive income and released to net income in the period(s) in&#13;
      which the effect on net income of the hedged item is recorded. Fair value gains and losses on a derivative instrument not&#13;
      qualifying as a hedge are reported in net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments.&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation has designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing and lending activities as fair value hedges. The&#13;
      Corporation generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial instruments hedged, in&#13;
      terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features. However, the valuation methodologies applied to&#13;
      the derivative and the hedged financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133, may differ. The resulting ineffectiveness&#13;
      calculated for such relationships is recorded in net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments in the consolidated income&#13;
      statement.&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation has not designated any hedging relationships as cash flow hedges.&#13;
&#13;
      The risk management policy for each of the Corporation's principal business activities and the accounting policies particular to&#13;
      them are described below.&#13;
&#13;
      Lending activities The Corporation's policy is to closely match the currency, rate basis, and maturity of its loans and borrowings.&#13;
      Derivative instruments are used to convert the cash flows from fixed rate US dollar or non-US dollar loans into variable rate US dollars.&#13;
       The impact on net income of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps qualifying for the shortcut method under SFAS No. 133 is&#13;
      exactly offset by a corresponding adjustment to the fair value of the related loans. The Corporation has elected not to designate&#13;
      hedging relationships for all other lending-related derivatives that do not qualify for the shortcut method.&#13;
&#13;
      Client risk management activities The Corporation enters into derivatives transactions with its clients to help them hedge their own&#13;
      currency, interest rate, or commodity risk, which, in turn, improves the overall quality of the Corporation's loan portfolio. To hedge&#13;
      the market risks that arise from these transactions with clients, the Corporation enters into offsetting derivative transactions with&#13;
      matching terms with authorized market counterparties. Changes in fair value of all derivatives associated with these activities are&#13;
      reflected currently in net income. Though hedge accounting is not applicable to these activities, the matching of terms between&#13;
      the offsetting transactions minimizes the impact on net income. Fees and spreads charged on these transactions are recorded as&#13;
      income on an accrual basis.&#13;

&#13;
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities The Corporation issues debt securities in various capital markets with the objectives of minimizing its borrowing&#13;
costs, diversifying funding sources, and developing member countries' capital markets, sometimes using complex structures. These&#13;
structures include borrowings payable in multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference&#13;
to a specified index such as a stock market index, a reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange&#13;
rates. The Corporation uses derivative instruments with matching terms, primarily currency and interest rate swaps, to convert such&#13;
borrowings into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with the Corporation's matched funding policy. The Corporation has&#13;
designated the majority of derivatives associated with borrowing activities as fair value hedges of the underlying borrowings. There&#13;
are a small number of cash flow-like hedging transactions for which no hedge relationship has been designated.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolio management activities          The Corporation manages the interest rate, currency and other market risks&#13;
associated with certain of the time deposits and securities in its liquid asset portfolio by entering into derivative transactions to&#13;
convert the cash flows from those instruments into variable rate US dollars, consistent with the Corporation's matched funding&#13;
policy. The derivative instruments used include short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest&#13;
rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. As the entire liquid asset portfolio is classified as a&#13;
trading portfolio, all securities (including derivatives) are carried at fair value, and no hedging relationships have been designated.&#13;
&#13;
Asset and liability management In addition to the risk managed in the context of its business activities detailed above, the&#13;
Corporation faces residual market risk in its overall asset and liability management. Residual currency risk is managed by monitoring&#13;
the aggregate position in each lending currency and eliminating the net excess asset or liability position through spot sales or&#13;
purchases. Interest rate risk due to reset date mismatches is reduced by synchronizing the reset dates on assets and liabilities and&#13;
managing overall interest rate risk on an aggregate basis.              Interest rate risk arising from mismatches due to writedowns,&#13;
prepayments and reschedulings, and residual reset date mismatches, is monitored by measuring the sensitivity of the present value&#13;
of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point change in interest rates.&#13;
The Corporation monitors the credit risk associated with these activities by careful assessment and monitoring of prospective and&#13;
actual clients and counterparties. In respect of liquid assets and derivatives transactions, credit risk is managed by establishing&#13;
exposure limits based on the credit rating and size of the individual counterparty. In addition, the Corporation has entered into&#13;
master agreements governing derivative transactions that contain close-out and netting provisions and collateral arrangements.&#13;
Under these agreements, if the Corporation's credit exposure to a counterparty, on a mark-to-market basis, exceeds a specified&#13;
level, the counterparty must post collateral to cover the excess, generally in the form of liquid government securities.&#13;
&#13;
Resource mobilization - The Corporation mobilizes funds from commercial banks and other financial institutions (Participants) by&#13;
facilitating loan participations, without recourse. These loan participations are administered and serviced by the Corporation on&#13;
behalf of the Participants. Loan participations serving as collateral under secured borrowing arrangements are included in loans on&#13;
the Corporation's consolidated balance sheet with the related secured borrowing included in liabilities on the Corporation's&#13;
consolidated balance sheet. The disbursed and outstanding balances of the loan participations that are considered sales are not&#13;
included in the Corporation's consolidated balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Pension and other postretirement benefits - IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan&#13;
(RSBP) and a Post-Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of its staff members as well as the staff of the&#13;
Corporation and of MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance&#13;
benefits to eligible retirees. The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs associated with these plans&#13;
are allocated between IBRD, the Corporation, and MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation in the plans. In&#13;
addition, the Corporation and MIGA reimburse IBRD for their share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
The net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense allocated to the Corporation is included in expense&#13;
from pension and other postretirement benefits in the consolidated income statement. The Corporation includes a receivable from&#13;
IBRD in receivables and other assets, representing prepaid pension and other postretirement benefit costs.&#13;
&#13;
Variable Interest Entities - In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46,&#13;
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46). During December 2003, FASB replaced FIN 46&#13;
with FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R). FIN 46 and FIN&#13;
46R define certain VIEs and require parties to such entities to assess and measure variable interests in the VIEs for the purpose of&#13;
determining possible consolidation of the VIEs. Variable interests can arise from financial instruments, service contracts,&#13;
guarantees, leases or other arrangements with VIE. An entity that will absorb a majority of VIE's expected losses or expected&#13;
residual returns is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and must include the assets, liabilities, and results of operations&#13;
of the VIE in its consolidated financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has a number of investments in VIEs which it manages and supervises in a manner consistent with other portfolio&#13;
investments. Note W provides further details regarding the Corporation's variable interests in VIEs.&#13;

       Accounting and financial reporting developments - During the year ended June 30, 2006, the Corporation changed its accounting&#13;
       principle with respect to the amortization of loan origination fees and loan origination costs. Prior to the year ended June 30, 2006,&#13;
       the net of loan origination fees and costs was considered to be insignificant. Beginning in year ended June 30, 2006, the&#13;
       Corporation began amortizing loan origination fees and costs on an effective yield basis.&#13;
&#13;
       The FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB&#13;
       Statement No. 3. The Corporation early adopted SFAS No. 154 as of July 1, 2005. The adoption had no material impact on the&#13;
       Corporation's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
       The FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations - an interpretation of FASB&#13;
       Statement No. 143 (FIN 47). The Corporation adopted FIN 47 as of June 30, 2006 and has accrued a liability for its estimated&#13;
       conditional asset retirement obligations in four oil and gas UJVs.&#13;
&#13;
       The US Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued, and the FASB ratified, Statement of Position (SOP) 03-3, Accounting for&#13;
       Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer (SOP 03-3). The Corporation adopted SOP 03-3 as of July 1, 2005, and the&#13;
       adoption had no material impact on the Corporation's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
       During the year ended June 30, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments - an amendment of&#13;
       FASB Statements Nos. 133 and 140 (SFAS No. 155) and SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets - an amendment&#13;
       of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS No. 156). Both SFAS No. 155 and SFAS No. 156 are effective for fiscal years beginning after&#13;
       September 15, 2006, which would be the year ending June 30, 2008 for IFC. The Corporation is presently assessing the possible&#13;
       impact of SFAS No. 155 and SFAS No. 156.&#13;
&#13;
       In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2006, the FASB issued and/or approved various FASB Staff Positions, EITF Issues Notes,&#13;
       and other interpretative guidance related to Statements of Financial Accounting Standards and APB Opinions. The Corporation&#13;
       analyzed and implemented the new guidance, as appropriate, with no material impact on either the financial position, results of&#13;
       operations or cash flows of the Corporation.&#13;

       date for certain member countries beyond this date. Pursuant to these arrangements, $1 million of subscribed shares remained&#13;

       may provide, among other things, for a final settlement of all obligations of the member to IFC. If such an agreement is not made&#13;
       within six months after the member withdraws or such other time as the Corporation and the member may agree, the repurchase&#13;
       price of the member's capital stock shall be the value thereof shown by the books of IFC on the day when the member&#13;
       withdraws. The repurchase of capital stock is subject to certain conditions, including payments in installments, at such times and in&#13;
       such available currency or currencies as the Corporation reasonably determines, taking into account the financial position of the&#13;
       Corporation. IFC's Articles of Agreement also provide for the withdrawing member to repay losses on loans and equity&#13;
       investments in excess of reserves provided on the date of withdrawal.&#13;

attributable to loans and related derivatives transactions, and unrealized gains of $0 million (gains $3 million - year ended June 30,&#13;

&#13;
Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on July 1, 2000, the Corporation recorded a gain of $14 million to accumulated other&#13;
comprehensive income to adjust the book value to fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps in cash flow-like hedges. The&#13;
Corporation elected not to seek hedge accounting for these transactions under SFAS No. 133 and, accordingly, records the cross-&#13;
currency interest rate swaps at fair value, with the change in fair value included in earnings. The gain recorded in accumulated&#13;
other comprehensive income upon adoption of SFAS No. 133 is released into earnings over the remaining original hedge term. The&#13;
amounts released for the years ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005 are shown above; the expected release for the year ending&#13;
June 30, 2007 is $0 million.&#13;

NOTE P Â­ DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Many of the Corporation's financial instruments are not actively traded in any market. Accordingly, estimates and present value&#13;
calculations of future cash flows are used to estimate the fair values. Determining future cash flows for fair value estimation is&#13;
subjective and imprecise, and minor changes in assumptions or methodologies may materially affect the estimated values. The&#13;
excess or deficit resulting from the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values presented does not necessarily&#13;
reflect the realizable values, since the Corporation generally holds loans, borrowings and other financial instruments to maturity with&#13;
the aim of realizing their recorded values.&#13;
&#13;
The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environments as of June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005. In different interest rate&#13;
environments, the fair value of the Corporation's financial assets and liabilities could differ significantly, especially the fair value of&#13;
certain fixed rate financial instruments. Reasonable comparability of fair values among financial institutions is not likely, because of&#13;
the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates that must be made in the absence of secondary&#13;
market prices. This lack of objective pricing standards introduces a greater degree of subjectivity and volatility to these derived or&#13;
estimated fair values. Therefore, while disclosure of estimated fair values of financial instruments is required, readers are cautioned in&#13;
using these data for purposes of evaluating the financial condition of the Corporation. The fair values of the individual financial&#13;
instruments do not represent the fair value of the Corporation taken as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
The methodologies used and key assumptions made to estimate fair values as of June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005 are summarized&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid assets - The estimated fair value of time deposits and the trading securities portfolio are based on quoted market prices and&#13;
the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
Derivative instruments - Fair values for covered forwards were derived by using quoted market forward exchange rates. Fair values&#13;
for other derivative instruments were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate&#13;
discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
Loans and loan commitments - The Corporation generally has not sold its loans from the portfolio, and there is no comparable&#13;
secondary market. Fair values for fixed rate loans and loan commitments were determined using a discounted cash flow model&#13;
based on a discount rate comprising the fixed rate loan spread plus the year-end estimated cost of funds. Since rates on variable&#13;

&#13;
       rate loans and loan commitments are generally reset on a quarterly or semiannual basis, the carrying value adjusted for credit risk&#13;
       was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. The Corporation also holds options to convert loans into equity of certain of its&#13;
       investee companies. Fair values of these conversion options are based on quoted market prices or other calculated values of the&#13;
       underlying equity investment.&#13;
&#13;
       Equity investments - Fair values of equity investments accounted for at cost less impairment were determined using market prices&#13;
       where available, put option prices, book values or cost, certain of which were discounted based upon management's estimate of&#13;
       net realizable value. Where market prices were not available or alternate valuation techniques were not practical, cost was&#13;
       determined to be the best estimate of fair value. Fair values of investments in LLPs and certain LLCs, other equity method&#13;
       investments and equity investments held by consolidated VIEs are not included.&#13;
&#13;
       Borrowings - Fair values were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount&#13;
       rates.&#13;

       Estimated fair values of the Corporation's financial assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are summarized&#13;

NOTE Q Â­ CURRENCY POSITION&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation conducts its operations for its loans, time deposits and securities and borrowings in multiple currencies. The&#13;
Corporation's policy is to minimize the level of currency risk by closely matching the currency of its assets (other than equity&#13;
investments and quasi-equity investments) and liabilities by using hedging instruments. The Corporation's equity investments in&#13;
enterprises located in its developing member countries are typically made in the local currency of the country. As a matter of&#13;
policy, the Corporation carries the currency risk of equity investments and quasi-equity investments and funds these investments&#13;
from its capital and retained earnings.&#13;
&#13;
The following table summarizes the Corporation's exposure in major currencies at June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005 (US$ millions):&#13;

      NOTE R Â­ SEGMENT REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
      For management purposes, the Corporation's business comprises two segments: client services and treasury services. The client&#13;
      services segment consists primarily of lending and equity investment activities. Operationally, the treasury services segment consists&#13;
      of the borrowing, liquid asset management, asset and liability management and client risk management activities. Consistent with&#13;
      internal reporting, net income (expense) from asset and liability management and client risk management activities in support of&#13;
      client services are allocated to client services segment.&#13;
&#13;
      The assessment of segment performance by senior management includes net income for each segment, return on assets, and&#13;
      return on capital employed. The Corporation's management reporting system and policies are used to determine revenues and&#13;
      expenses attributable to each segment. Consistent with internal reporting, administrative expenses are allocated to each segment&#13;
      based largely upon personnel costs and segment head counts. Transactions between segments are immaterial and, thus, are not&#13;
      a factor in reconciling to the consolidated data.&#13;
&#13;
      The accounting policies of the Corporation's segments are, in all material respects, consistent with those described in note A,&#13;
      "Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies."&#13;
&#13;
      An analysis of the Corporation's major components of income and expense by business segment for the years ended June 30,&#13;
      2006, June 30, 2005, and June 30, 2004 is given below (US$ millions):&#13;

      NOTE S Â­ PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation, IBRD, and MIGA participate in a defined benefit SRP, a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP), and a Post-Employment&#13;
      Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of their staff members.&#13;
&#13;
      The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance&#13;
      benefits to eligible retirees. The PEBP provides certain pension benefits administered outside the SRP.&#13;
&#13;
      The Corporation uses a June 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The amounts presented below reflect the Corporation's respective share of the costs, assets, and liabilities of the plans.&#13;
&#13;
All costs, assets, and liabilities associated with these plans are allocated between the Corporation, IBRD, and MIGA based upon&#13;
their employees' respective contributions to the plans. Costs allocated to IBRD are then shared between IBRD and IDA based on&#13;
an agreed cost-sharing ratio. The Corporation, IDA, and MIGA reimburse IBRD for their proportionate share of any contributions&#13;
made to these plans by IBRD. Contributions to these plans are calculated as a percentage of salary.&#13;
&#13;
The following table summarizes the benefit costs associated with the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP allocated to the Corporation for the fiscal&#13;
years ended June 30, 2006, June 30, 2005, and June 30, 2004 (US$ millions):&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The expenses for the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP are included in expense from pension and other postretirement benefit plans.&#13;
&#13;
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, June 30, 2005, and June 30, 2004, expenses for these plans of $28 million, $16 million and&#13;
$20 million, respectively, were allocated to IFC. The Corporation's net expense for these plans reported in the consolidated income&#13;
statement was $28 million, $14 million, and $19 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, June 30, 2005, and June 30, 2004,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
The following table summarizes the projected benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status associated with the&#13;
SRP, RSBP, and PEBP for the Corporation for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, June 30, 2005, and June 30, 2004 (US$ millions).&#13;
Since the assets for the PEBP are not held in an irrevocable trust separate from the assets of IBRD, they do not qualify for off-balance&#13;
sheet accounting and are therefore included in IBRD's investment portfolio. IFC has recognized a receivable (prepaid asset) from&#13;
IBRD and a payable (liability) to IBRD equal to the amount required to support the plan. The assets of the PEBP are invested in fixed&#13;
income instruments.&#13;

       The prepaid SRP cost was $348 million at June 30, 2006 ($308 million - June 30, 2005) and the prepaid RSBP cost was $24 million at&#13;
       June 30, 2006 ($18 million - June 30, 2005). These amounts are included in Receivables and other assets on the consolidated&#13;
       balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
       Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
       The actuarial assumptions used are based on financial market interest rates, past experience, and management's best estimate of&#13;
       future benefit changes and economic conditions. Changes in these assumptions will impact future benefit costs and obligations.&#13;
&#13;
       The expected long-term rate of return for the SRP assets is a weighted average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns&#13;
       for the various asset classes, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed using a forward-looking&#13;
       building block approach and are not strictly based on historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of&#13;
       expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed&#13;
       as the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk premium/spread (as appropriate). Other asset class returns are derived&#13;
       from their relationship to equity and bond markets. The expected long-term rate of return for the RSBP is computed using&#13;
       procedures similar to those used for the SRP. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to&#13;
       the year-end AAA and AA corporate bonds.&#13;
&#13;
       Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual results are different from expected results. Amortization of these unrecognized gains&#13;
       and losses will be included in income if, at the beginning of the fiscal year, they exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected&#13;
       benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If required, the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the&#13;
       expected average remaining service lives of the employee group.&#13;
&#13;
       The following tables present the weighted-average assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligations and the net&#13;
       periodic pension costs for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, June 30, 2005, and June 30, 2004:&#13;

Investment Strategy&#13;
&#13;
The investment policy for the SRP and the RSBP is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the respective plan's&#13;
needs and goals, using a global diversified portfolio of various asset classes. Specifically, the long-term asset allocation is based on&#13;
an analysis that incorporates expected returns by asset class as well as volatilities and correlations across asset classes and the&#13;
liability profile of the respective plans. This analysis, referred to as an asset-liability analysis, also provides estimates of potential future&#13;
contributions and future asset and liability balances. Plan assets are managed by external investment managers and monitored by&#13;
IBRD's pension investment department. The pension plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of public equity, fixed income,&#13;
and alternative investments. The fixed-income and public equity asset classes are rebalanced on a monthly basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

       Expected Contributions&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation's contribution to the SRP and RSBP varies from year to year, as determined by the Pension Finance Committee,&#13;
       which bases its judgment on the results of annual actuarial valuations of the assets and liabilities of the SRP and RSBP. The best&#13;
       estimate of the amount of contributions expected to be paid to the SRP and RSBP for the Corporation during the fiscal year&#13;
       beginning July 1, 2006 is $25 million and $9 million, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       NOTE T Â­ SERVICE AND SUPPORT PAYMENTS&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation obtains certain administrative and overhead services from IBRD in those areas where common services can be&#13;
       efficiently provided by IBRD. This includes shared costs of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such as&#13;
       communications, internal auditing, administrative support, supplies, and insurance. The Corporation makes payments for these&#13;
       services to IBRD based on negotiated fees, chargebacks and allocated charges, where chargeback is not feasible. Expenses&#13;
       allocated to the Corporation for the year ended June 30, 2006, were $23 million ($25 million - year ended June 30, 2005; $21 million -&#13;
       year ended June 30, 2004).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
NOTE W Â­ VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND OTHER CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
An entity is subject to FIN 46R and is called a variable interest entity (VIE) if it lacks: (1) equity that is sufficient to permit the entity to&#13;
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; or (2) equity investors who have decision-&#13;
making rights about the entity's operations or who do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity&#13;
proportionally to their voting rights.&#13;
&#13;
A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party involved with the VIE that absorbs a majority of the expected&#13;
losses or receives a majority of the expected residual returns or both. The primary beneficiary is required to initially measure the&#13;
assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the VIE at their carrying amounts at the date on which it first became the primary&#13;
beneficiary. Because certain VIEs were created prior to the issuance of FIN 46R, it may not be practicable to determine the&#13;
carrying amounts of the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at the initial date, and in such cases, the primary beneficiary&#13;
must measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the date FIN 46R is first applied. The primary&#13;
beneficiary is also required to disclose information about the nature, purpose, size, and activities of the VIE, and collateral and&#13;
recourse creditors may have against the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
An enterprise may hold significant variable interests in VIEs, which are not consolidated because the enterprise is not the primary&#13;
beneficiary. In such cases, the enterprise is required to disclose information about its involvement with and exposure to the VIE,&#13;
and about the nature, purpose, size, and activities of the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
An enterprise is not required to apply FIN 46R to certain entities if, after making an exhaustive effort, it is unable to obtain the&#13;
information necessary to: (1) determine whether the entity is a VIE; (2) determine if the enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the&#13;
possible VIE; or (3) perform the accounting required to consolidate a possible VIE. In such cases, the enterprise is required to&#13;
disclose the number of entities to which FIN 46R is not being applied, why the information required to apply FIN 46R is not&#13;
available, the nature, purpose and activities of the entities to which FIN 46R is not being applied, and the enterprise's maximum&#13;
exposure to the entities to which FIN 46R is not being applied.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has identified seven VIEs in which the Corporation is deemed to be the primary beneficiary at June 30, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Four of the VIEs have been consolidated into IFC's financial statements as of June 30, 2006. One consolidated VIE is in the Finance&#13;
and Insurance sector in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Three consolidated VIEs are in the Collective Investment&#13;
Vehicles sector in the Latin America and Caribbean region.&#13;
&#13;
The remaining three VIEs in which the Corporation is deemed to be the primary beneficiary have not been consolidated into IFC's&#13;
financial statements, as they are significantly impaired and information required to apply the provisions of FIN 46R is not available.&#13;
IFC's net investment in these three entities totals $2 million, virtually all in the primary metals sector in the Asia region. Based on the&#13;
most recent financial data available, total net assets of the three entities is $12 million.&#13;
&#13;
As a result of the consolidation of the four investments described above, IFC's consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2006&#13;
includes additional assets of $6 million in equity investments ($0 million - June 30, 2005), $3 million in receivables and other assets&#13;
($131 million - June 30, 2005), and additional liabilities of $2 million in payables and other liabilities ($131 million - June 30, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
Other income for the year ended June 30, 2006 includes $17 million of income from consolidated entities ($5 million - year ended&#13;
June 30, 2005; $0 million - year ended June 30, 2004) and other expense includes $10 million of expenses from consolidated&#13;
entities ($5 million - year ended June 30, 2005; $0 million - year ended June 30, 2004).&#13;

       NOTE X Â­ MATERIAL TRANSACTION&#13;
&#13;
       On December 21, 2005, the Corporation entered into an agreement to sell its shares in Banca Comerciala Romana S.A. (BCR). The&#13;
       agreement includes provisions that may result in the termination of the agreement prior to closing. In addition, IFC has entered&#13;
       into an agreement which includes certain payment covenants and potential indemnifications with respect to certain conditions&#13;
       and valuations in case such conditions and valuations become applicable. The transaction did not close by June 30, 2006. Should&#13;
       the transaction close in accordance with the agreement, IFC would expect to recognize a significant capital gain in the year&#13;
       ending June 30, 2007, in the range of $669 million to $841 million (based on June 30, 2006 exchange rates).&#13;

This table includes technical assistance and advisory projects approved during Fy06. This work is supported by various donors,&#13;
including iFC itself.&#13;
     Many projects in the table are carried out by a network of facilities managed by iFC; some serve a developing region,&#13;
while others emphasize a specific aspect of development. Many facilities, including most of the regional project development&#13;
facilities, fund their activities from a pool of core funds raised from a group of donors; other facilities, such as the Private&#13;
enterprise Partnership, raise donor funds specifically for individual projects and initiatives.&#13;
     in addition to the facilities, iFC manages trust funds on behalf of many donor governments to support technical&#13;
assistance work. The Funding Mechanism for Technical assistance and advisory Services uses a portion of the Corporation's&#13;
retained earnings to support specific activities.&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2006 : increasing impact - the year in review
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The International Finance Corporation
            (IFC) set a record in fiscal 2006 for new investment
            commitments. This report explores IFC's increasing
            development impact and provides information on its
            investments and other activities for the fiscal year. In its
            50th year, the IFC is the largest provider of multilateral
            financing for private sector projects in the developing
            world. It committed $6.7 billion in funds from its own
            account and mobilized an additional $1.6 billion through
            syndications and $1.3 billion through structured finance.
            Based on the total costs of the private sector projects it
            helped finance this year, each $1 in IFC commitments for its
            own account resulted in an additional $2.88 in funding from
            other sources. Altogether, IFC supported 284 investment
            projects in 66 countries. This year nearly a quarter of IFC
            commitments were in low-income or high-risk countries,
            demonstrating the viability of private enterprise even in
            difficult environments. IFC's investment commitments to
            firms operating in the Middle East and North Africa more
            than doubled in fiscal 2006, and commitments for private
            sector projects in Sub-Saharan Africa increased nearly 60
            percent. IFC introduced a new development outcome tracking
            system for investment operations to measure and track
            results throughout the life of a project; a similar system
            was implemented to monitor the development impact of all
            active technical assistance and advisory projects.
