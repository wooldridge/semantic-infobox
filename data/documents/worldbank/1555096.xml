BEHAVIOR OF FOODGRAIN PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION IN INDIA, 1960-77&#13;
The apparent per capita consumption of foodgrains in,India during&#13;
1975-77 was below that in 1970-72, or even 1960-62, despite trend increases&#13;
in average per capita income of more than 1 percent per annum since at least&#13;
1960. Several explanations are possible: that the consumption is under-&#13;
estimated either because production is underestimated or the adjustments made&#13;
to production estimates to derive consumption are incorrect; or that consump-&#13;
tion did decline because of changes in the real price of foodgrain, adverse&#13;
changes in the distribution of income, changes in tastes or other reasons.&#13;
The paper concludes that movements in price, income and savings constitute&#13;
a significant part of the explanation. Underestimation of production cannot&#13;
be a large part of the explanation, although production may be underestimated&#13;
by a small amount. A part of the explanation may well be in unrecorded stock&#13;
changes or overadjustments for feed, seed and wastes in estimating consumption&#13;
from production estimates. A more complete picture will be available only&#13;
when the National Sample Survey results of the 1977/78 round of consumption&#13;
surveys are published.&#13;

1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.        The foodgrain situation in India during the triennium 1975-77&#13;
was different from that in the past in several respects. First, average&#13;
production rea.ched 110.8 million tons 1/ which was not only higher than that&#13;
recorded in any previous three-year period but also 2.4 million tons more than&#13;
the previous single year's high of 108.4 million tons set in 1970/71. Secondly,&#13;
foodgrain stocks which dwindled to an uncomfortable level of around 3 million&#13;
tons towards the end of 1973 were replenished to a sizeable 17 million tons&#13;
by the end of 1977. The accumulated stocks are reported to have gone up&#13;
further with another bumper crop of 1977/78. Thirdly, the index of real&#13;
price of foodgrains 2/ which reached 125 in 1974 (1961/62 = 100), declined&#13;
to 106 in 1977.&#13;
2.        Yet, the per capita availability of foodgrains during the triennium&#13;
1975-77 based on official estimates of availability was lower than that in&#13;
1970-72 or, even 1960-62. This is inconsistent with the apparent increase&#13;
in per capita income (assuming no change in income distribution) and decline&#13;
of real prices.&#13;
3.        The failure of per capita foodgrain consumption to rise during&#13;
1975-77, in spite of a good harvest, a comfortable price situation and an&#13;
ample supply position, as reflected in stock accumulation needs some explan-&#13;
ation. One plausible explanation is that the availability figures, derived&#13;
from the foodgrain production estimates, are underestimated, the order of&#13;
underestimation increasing with time 3/, particularly during 1975-77, such&#13;
that the reported decline in consumption is more apparent than real. On the&#13;
other hand, the demand for foodgrains may have really fallen. Demand will&#13;
fall if income distribution worsens and, as a result, most of the increase in&#13;
income is absorbed by the section of the population whose income elasticity&#13;
of demand for foodgrains is very low, while the per capita consumption of&#13;
the poor, whose income elasticity is high, declines. A shift in income dis-&#13;
tribution (particularly in rural areas) may arise if an increase in the&#13;
production of grain by medium or large farmers results in a disproportion-&#13;
ately large increase in the amount of grain they market or from more general&#13;
changes in income distribution. Demand for foodgrains will also slacken,&#13;
other things being equal, if there is a gradual shift in tastes and pre-&#13;
ferences from foodgrains to other foods. In this case, it is necessary&#13;
to examine further the nature of the shift and the impact it may have on&#13;
the long-term demand for grains and other non-grain foods.&#13;
1/   Tons refer to metric tons throughout this paper.&#13;
2/   Index number of wholesale prices of foodgrains         x 100&#13;
Index number of wholesale prices of all commodities&#13;
3/   One possible reason for underestimation may be that the sample selected&#13;
for crop cutting surveys did not reflect adequately the proportion of&#13;
irrigated areas and of areas under high yielding varieties in some of&#13;
the States. As these proportions increase over time, the extent of&#13;
underestimation may also increase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.         It is proposed to examine the behavior of foodgrains production and&#13;
consumption in India over the period 1960-77 in order to ascertain whether&#13;
the fall in per capita consumption (or, demand) is real or apparent; and, if&#13;
real, the causes thereof.   The official estimates of production will be ex-&#13;
amined first to see whether they are consistent with the production potential&#13;
created from additional area under foodgrains, extra irrigation benefits and&#13;
increase in fertilizer consumption.    An attempt will also be made to study the&#13;
position at the State level given the limitations of the existing data. If&#13;
there are no major indications of underestimation of production and, hence,&#13;
of availability, the next step will be to critically analyze the data on food-&#13;
grain consumption to see if a structural change is discernible over time.&#13;
5.        The conclusions of the study have important policy implications for&#13;
growth and development strategy. Despite the increase in production and per&#13;
capita national income, if the demand for foodgrains has failed to register&#13;
an increase, either greater efforts will be needed to push programs designed&#13;
to raise the income and employment opportunities of the poor and to encourage&#13;
production in relatively backward areas or, the assumptions underlying the&#13;
demand forecasts for foodgrains in the future plans will need to be reassessed.&#13;
2. FOODGRAIN PRODUCTION TRENDS 1/&#13;
6.        The long-term trend in foodgrain production shows an annual increase&#13;
of 2.42 percent between 1949/50 and 1976/77 and 2.44 percent between 1960/61&#13;
and 1976/77. However, the growth is not uniform. The periods 1949/50 to&#13;
1960-61 and 1964/65 to 1970/71 witnessed fairly rapid growth in production --&#13;
2.8 and 3.3 percent per annum respectively. But the interim period 1960/61&#13;
to 1964/65 was a period of slow growth (2.1 percent) while the period from&#13;
1970/71 to 1974/75 was one of stagnation. Foodgrain production growth seems&#13;
to have picked up again starting from 1975/76. 2/&#13;
7.        Among the sources of growth, area contributed most during the&#13;
period 1949/50 to 1960/61. Subsequently, yields advanced more rapidly. This&#13;
was largely due to large increase in irrigated area between 1964/65 and in the&#13;
consumption of fertilizer through 1970/71, though from an initially low level.&#13;
During the period 1970/71 to 1974/75, the growth in irrigated area as well as&#13;
in fertilizer consumption slowed down. All these have picked up since 1975/76&#13;
as will be seen from Table 1.&#13;
8.         The annual increase in foodgrain production of 2.4 percent per annum&#13;
over the past two decades barely kept pace with population which increased by&#13;
2.3 percent per annum during this period. The gain in per capita output, if&#13;
any, is therefore modest. However, there are a few other trends in production&#13;
which are worth noting.&#13;
1/   For a discussion on reliability of production estimates, refer to&#13;
Annex I.&#13;
2/   For a more complete discussion of the variations in the growth of food-&#13;
grains production in the different periods up to 1973/74, refer to (1).&#13;

9.        First, as the foodgrains production graph (Figure 1) shows, the con-&#13;
secutive peaks and troughs are at successively higher levels, and the trough&#13;
points of production in 1976/77 and 1972/73 are higher than the preceding peak&#13;
points in 1970/71 and 1967/68 respectively.&#13;

10.       Secondly, the variability (or instability) in aggregate foodgrains&#13;
production appears to have been less in the post high-yielding varieties&#13;
period; the coefficient of variation decreased from 0.14 during 1949/50 to&#13;
1964/65 and 0.08 during 1967/68 to 1976/77. 1/&#13;
11.       Thirdly, between 1966/67 and 1976/77, the actual levels of pro-&#13;
duction are higher than the long-term trend values (1949/50 to 1976/77)&#13;
in six out of ten years, and the average of positive deviations from the&#13;
trend line is higher than the average of the negative deviations, reflecting&#13;
the impact of new technology.&#13;
3. CONSISTENCY OF PRODUCTION ESTIMATES&#13;
Production Potential Approach&#13;
12.       Consistency of the foodgrains production estimates can be examined&#13;
by comparing the officially reported production with the production potential&#13;
created by additions to area, irrigation, and fertilizers. Since the level&#13;
as also the efficiency of use of each of these inputs, and, thus, the extent&#13;
to which they get reflected in actual production depend in a large measure&#13;
1/   CH Hanumantha Rao (2) holds the opposite view that the fluctuations in&#13;
the output of foodgrains as a whole increased in the decade 1961-71&#13;
when compared to the previous decade. In our view, he arrived at this&#13;
conclusion because he included the two severe drought years of 1965/66&#13;
and 1966/67 which were not covered by our computations. Research under-&#13;
way at the International Food Policy Research Institute is expected to&#13;
throw further light on this subject.&#13;

on the vagaries of weather, it is important to allow for these fluctuations&#13;
in such comparisons. One method of evening out, at least in part, the annual&#13;
fluctuations caused by weather is to consider a three year average and take&#13;
that to represent the situation in the mid-year of the triennium. The trien-&#13;
nia 1/ 1960-62 and 1975-77 have been chosen in the present analysis.&#13;
13.       Table 2 provides data on the inputs and the response coefficients&#13;
that have been considered in examining the production potential. Area is&#13;
broken down into coarse grains and pulses and rice and wheat and the latter&#13;
separately considered to take into account the effects of changes in cropping&#13;
pattern. Using the response coefficients, the contribution of each of the&#13;
inputs in creating the additional production potential between 1960-62 (base&#13;
period) and 1970-72 and 1975-77 is shown in Table 3. The average additional&#13;
production potential created during 1970-72 and 1975-77 was 25.05 and 33.47&#13;
million tons respectively. To this, if we add the base level production of&#13;
80.62 million tons in 1960-62, the corresponding total production potential&#13;
would be 105.67 and 114.09 million tons. This may be compared with the&#13;
official production estimate of 104.36 million tons in 1970-72 and 110.81&#13;
million tons in 1975-77. Clearly, the difference between the actual reported&#13;
production and the potential created is not considerable 2/, 1.31 million&#13;
tons in 1970-72 and 3.28 million tons in 1975-77 over 1960-62. On the basis&#13;
of these figures, it cannot be concluded that the official production figures&#13;
have been underestimated to any significant degree. 3/&#13;
1/   These relate to crop years 1959/60 to 1961/62 and so on.&#13;
2/   The method adopted by Mellor, et al. (4) for estimating potential leads&#13;
to a different set of estimates of foodgrain production potential for&#13;
1975-77 which is considerably higher than our figures.     The difference&#13;
is mainly due to their treatment of labor as an input.     In this exercise,&#13;
because of the difficulties in estimating labor used in agriculture, we&#13;
have not attempted that. We assume that the response coefficients for&#13;
land and irrigation and fertilizers include the response from associated&#13;
labor inputs.&#13;
3/   While this is a general conclusion, individual years' data suggest that&#13;
actual production is higher than the production potential in good years&#13;
and vice-versa in bad years (Figure 2).&#13;

NCA Report (10) summarizes the main findings of the various field trials&#13;
as follows:&#13;
"As regards output response to fertilizer application,&#13;
analysis of a large mass of data from fertilizer trials on&#13;
farmers' fields suggests an average of 8 kg of grain per kg&#13;
of nutrients for the traditional varieties. A yardstick of&#13;
10 kg of additional production of foodgrains per kg of nutri-&#13;
ent would reasonably represent the average performance of both&#13;
high yielding and traditional varieties of cereals and pulses&#13;
under actual conditions."&#13;
Report of the National Commission on Agriculture (1976), Part III --&#13;
Demand and Supply, pp. 77 and 78.&#13;
c/   This refers to the average yield of coarse grains and pulses in 1960-62&#13;
when little or no fertilizer or irrigation was applied.&#13;
d/   Derived as a residual after the effects of irrigation, fertilizer,&#13;
area under coarse grains, and pulses are removed from the 1960-62 output,&#13;
using the above response ratios. That is, the total foodgrain production&#13;
of 80.62 million tons in 1959/60 to 1961/62 was decomposed into that from&#13;
irrigated area, i.e., 22.12 million hectares x 0.5 = 11.06 million tons;&#13;
that from fertilizer use, i.e., 0.219 million tons x 8 = 1.75 million&#13;
tons; and that from land (derived as a residual), i.e., 80.62- (11.06 +&#13;
1.75) = 67.81 million tons. From the estimated output of 67.81 million&#13;
tons due to land only, the contribution of coarse grains and pulses was&#13;
taken out assuming a yield of 0.45 tons per hectare which prevailed in&#13;
the base period when little or no water or fertilizer was used on these&#13;
crops, i.e., 68.70 million hectares x 0.45 = 30.91 million tons. The&#13;
rest of the production, i.e., 36.9 million tons was attributed to rice&#13;
and wheat with an area of 47.5 million hectares in the base period, which&#13;
gave a yield of 0.78 tons per hectare -- the difference between 0.78 and&#13;
0.45 (0.33) is, therefore, due to a shift in cropping pattern from coarse&#13;
grains/pulses to wheat and rice.&#13;

Production Function Approach&#13;
14.       In this section, the consistency of production estimates is examined&#13;
with the use of production functions. It will be argued that if production&#13;
has been underestimated in the 1970s, then the implied response to inputs&#13;
would be lower during this period compared to the 1960s and the difference,&#13;
if any, in the estimated output as a result of this will be due to underesti-&#13;
mation. True, this is a rather strong assumption to make, since implied&#13;
response may decline due to a host of reasons, both technical and non-technical.&#13;
However, given the present level of input use in India, it may be reasonable&#13;
to assume that agriculture is operating in the range of increasing returns and,&#13;
hence, the reasons for decline, if any, are likely to be non-technical.&#13;
15.       We started out by regressing output (0) on a set of input variables&#13;
(Xi's) covering the periods (i) 1960/61 to 1970/71, and (ii) 1960/61 to 1976/77.&#13;
The functional form was specified as follows:&#13;
0 = a + b.X. + u&#13;
Where i ranges from 1 to n and u is a random disturbance term. The input&#13;
variables (X.'s) considered were:&#13;
xli  =     the quantity of fertilizer applied to foodgrains;&#13;
X2   =    the irrigated area under foodgrains;&#13;
X3      =  the unirrigated area under foodgrains;&#13;
X4      =  the rainfall relative 1/;&#13;
X5   =    total area under foodgrains; and&#13;
X6   =    the area under high yielding varieties.&#13;
The data are given in Annex III.&#13;
16.       Because of the complementary nature of the agricultural inputs, it&#13;
is difficult to disentangle the individual contribution of each input variable&#13;
in a production function. The variables tend to be highly correlated with&#13;
each other, which adversely affects the efficiency of estimates (Annex IV).&#13;
After following a stepwise regression approach, fertilizer (x ) was chosen as&#13;
a proxy fo5 the package of inputs. Also, from a cursory look at the data and&#13;
from the R and "t" ratios, fertilizer seemed to bear the closest relationship&#13;
to output. The results are shown below:&#13;
1/   The method of working out the rainfall relative is given in the note&#13;
to Annex III.&#13;

17.       It will be seen that the average response coefficient to the package&#13;
went down from 16.22:1 during 1960/61 to 1970/71 to 14.68:1 during 1960/61 to&#13;
1976/77 2/, which should not have normally happened. If the same response&#13;
coefficients given by equation (2) are used to extrapolate for the period&#13;
1971/72 to 1976/77, the estimated production in 1976/77 would be 3.22 million&#13;
tons higher than that obtained from equation (3), (Table 4). The difference&#13;
between the "potential" and "actual" estimated through this method comes&#13;
remarkably close to that estimated in the previous section by the production&#13;
potential approach. 3/&#13;
1/ - Figures in parenthesis refer to "t" values.&#13;
2/   It would have been useful to examine if the difference in the coeffi-&#13;
cients, thus calculated, are statistically significant. However, the&#13;
conventional tool of analysis for testing the significance of the&#13;
differences in two regression lines would suggest fitting separate re-&#13;
gression lines for the periods 1960/61 to 1970/71 and 1970/71 to 1976/77&#13;
and then comparing the two.   Because of small numbers of observations in&#13;
the latter period, such an exercise could not be done.    An alterntive,&#13;
within the present framework of analysis, would be to estimate output for&#13;
the period 1971/72 to 1976/77 using equation (2), and compare it with the&#13;
actual output for the same period. If the residuals are randomly distri-&#13;
buted, or if the sum of the positive and negative residuals were about&#13;
the same, one would be inclined to conclude that whether one used co-&#13;
efficients derived from equation (2) or (3) is unlikely to make much&#13;
difference to the estimated output. However, in five out of six years,&#13;
actual output was lower than the estimated suggesting that the differ-&#13;
ences in-output- as emerging from differences in coefficients are real.&#13;
3/   Between the two approaches, one would place more reliance on the pro-&#13;
duction potential approach. The production function approach suffers&#13;
from certain obvious problems of measurement. For example, we do not&#13;
know whether the production function covering the period 1960/61 to&#13;
1970/71 is the "true" production function; if not, the comparison will&#13;
not be meaningful. Nevertheless, this approach does provide an indi-&#13;
cation of the inconsistency in production estimates, if not the definite&#13;
magnitudes.&#13;

Discussion&#13;
18.       Both the production potential and production function approaches&#13;
point to a difference of about 3 million tons between the potential created&#13;
and the actual output of foodgrains reported. The estimate derived from the&#13;
production function approach is weather-adjusted, while that derived from the&#13;
production potential approach is not wholly so. It may be worth looking into&#13;
the implication of this difference vis-a-vis the decline in per capita con-&#13;
sumption. If actual production in 1975-77 was higher by 3 million tons, net&#13;
foodgrain availability would have been higher by 2.63 million tons (12.5&#13;
percent being seed, feed, and wastage) or 4.3 kg per capita. The total would&#13;
have been 163.2 kg per annum instead of 158.9 kg reported. But this would&#13;
still be lower than 169.4 kg per capita in 1970-72 and 168.0 kg per capita in&#13;
1960-62. Clearly, therefore, even if we agree that the 3 million tons dif-&#13;
ference is due to underestimation, it cannot explain the decline in per capita&#13;
availability witnessed in 1975-77.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Consistency of Statevise Estimates&#13;
19.       While the inconsistency between the official production estimates&#13;
and the estimated potential at the all-India level is not significant, wide&#13;
differences exist between the two with respect to individual States. Results&#13;
of Statewise exercises are presented in Annex V. As there are no data&#13;
on response coefficients at the State level, all-India yardsticks were used&#13;
in arriving at the potential. Also, total area rather than a breakdown into&#13;
coarse grains, pulses, wheat and rice was considered along with fertilizer&#13;
and irrigation. Because of these difficulties the results are suggestive&#13;
rather than conclusive.&#13;
20.       The excess potential over actual production thus estimated is&#13;
striking in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa,&#13;
Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh; however, equally striking is the opposite&#13;
in Gujarat, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal.    The reasons focr&#13;
such divergence, besides the use of all-India yardsticks which in many cases&#13;
are not applicable at the State level could be due to problems with staLis-&#13;
tical reporting, particularly of key inputs like irrigation. However, a&#13;
detailed investigation based on Statewise response coefficients is needed.&#13;
Otherwise, depending upon whether one considers one group of States or the&#13;
other, erroneous inferences-may be drawn as to the extent-of underestimation&#13;
or overestimation in Indian official foodgrain estimates.&#13;
4. TRENDS IN FOODGRAIN CONSUMPTION&#13;
21.       Trends in foodgrain consumption in India can be studied either&#13;
from the National Food Balance Sheets (FBS) or from the National Sample&#13;
Survey (NSS) data. The former is derived as gross production minus seed&#13;
feed and wastage (12.5 percent constant) plus net imports and changes in&#13;
government stocks. These data, therefore, generally refer to "availability"&#13;
rather than "consumption" in the strict sense of the term. The NSS data,&#13;
on the other hand, report on the actual consumption of the sample households.&#13;
22.       Data derived from the FBS are deficient in two ways.    First, they&#13;
do not take into account the stocks held privately by traders and producers&#13;
and, secondly, the allowance of a constant 12.5 percent of production for&#13;
seed, feed and wastage, which probably had some basis in the early 1950s,&#13;
cannot be supported in the more recent period in view of the changes taking&#13;
place in agricultural practices and technology. The NSS data are also not&#13;
free from defects. They are generally believed to overstate consumption (6);&#13;
also, they tend to underestimate consumption in the lower expenditure groups&#13;
and overestimate in the higher expenditure groups (7). 1/ Nevertheless, both&#13;
the FBS and the NSS data do provide an idea of the trend in foodgrain con-&#13;
sumption in India over time.&#13;

capita consumption, see Annex VI.&#13;

National Food Balance Sheets&#13;
23.       An analysis of annual data on per capita availability of foodgrains&#13;
between 1950 and 1977 (Annex VII) does not show any statistically meaning-&#13;
ful trend (8) (also see Figure 3). However, certain observations can be made&#13;
on the basis of triennial averages. 1/ Per capita consumption (availability)&#13;
of foograins for selected triennia and corresponding growth rates are given&#13;
in Table 5. Between 1950-52 and 1960-62, the consumption of both cereals&#13;
and pulses increased; in the subsequent period, cereal,consumption continued&#13;
to rise though at a much slower rate, but pulse consumption declined percept-&#13;
ibly. In the following five years, however, both cereal and pulse consumption&#13;
went down on an average by 1.16 and 2.17 percent annually, respectively. The&#13;
fall in consumption of pulses is understandable in view of the decline in&#13;
production and the absence of imports and arrangements for public distribu-&#13;
tion, whereas the fall in cereals needs some explanation.&#13;

24.       The reasons for the sluggish growth in foodgrain consumption between&#13;
1960-62 and 1970-72 can be adequately explained by the behavior of income and&#13;
prices during this period. Based on an income elasticity of demand for food-&#13;
grains of 0.46 and price elasticity of -0.34, 2/ the National Commission on&#13;
Agriculture (10) found that, corresponding to an increase in real income of&#13;
12.41 percent and real prices 3/ of 14.05 percent between 1960-62 and 1970-72,&#13;
the per capita consumption of 169.4 kg per year during 1970-72 was consistent&#13;
with the estimated market demand.&#13;

25.       However, the drop in per capita consumption between 1970-72 and&#13;
1975-77 is not so easily explained by economic variables. Table 6 provides&#13;
the key economic data in this regard and the following features emerge from&#13;
an examination of the table. First, per capita real income increased between&#13;
1970-72 and 1975-77 and real prices of foodgrains dropped (rows 1 and 2).&#13;
Hence, both the income and the price effects were positive and, given a set&#13;
of elasticities, foodgrain consumption should have increased. (If we use&#13;
the NCA elasticities (10) per capita foodgrain consumption should have&#13;
increased by 2.9 percent between 1970-72 and 1975-77 as against the 6.2&#13;
percent decline). Secondly, even if we assume the income and the price&#13;
elasticities to be zero, an extreme assumption, total availability (row 8)&#13;
should have increased by 10.6 percent, i.e., the same as increase in popula-&#13;
tion (row 7), as against the actual 3.8 percent rise. Thirdly, the failure&#13;
of consumption or availability to rise during 1975-77 was not due to supply&#13;
problems. As already mentioned, real prices were lower than in 1970-72,&#13;
indicating a relatively more comfortable supply position, but more inter-&#13;
estingly, the entire demand was met from domestic production (rows 5 and 6).&#13;

26.        Imports, averaging 4.8 million tons per annum during this period&#13;
actually went towards the accumulation of stocks. Hence, both from the&#13;
point of view of domestic production as well as size of imports and stock&#13;
accumulations, the supply position during the 1975-77 period was comfortable.&#13;
27.       What then caused the drop in consumption between 1970-72 and 1975-77?&#13;
Could there have been a deterioration in the distribution of income during&#13;
this period? Could tastes and preferences have shifted away from foodgrains&#13;
to other items of food? Could the savings/income ratio have changed (the&#13;
present method of estimating demand from GNP growth assumes a constant ratio)?&#13;
Or, is the defect inherent in the data relating to per capita availability?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
28.       True, in rural areas, particularly in those States where the&#13;
green revolution has had an impact, income distribution may have worsened&#13;
as farm incomes increased more rapidly in the larger holdings relative to&#13;
others. However, to what extent this may have affected the overall picture&#13;
is not clear. From the limited nature of the success of the new technology,&#13;
this could not have had a major impact in the aggregate. Similarly, over-&#13;
all economic conditions in the country and a priori knowledge of the situa-&#13;
tion during this period rule out the possibility of a shift in the demand&#13;
schedule of each expenditure class to the left -- arising from shifts in&#13;
tastes and preferences; though, in the higher income groups, some such shifts&#13;
may have taken place. But the savings/income ratio did undergo a change&#13;
during the period 1970-72 to 1975-77. Savings as a proportion of the GNP&#13;
increased from 12.9 percent in 1970-72 to 17.9 percent in 1975-77 and as a&#13;
result, per capita expenditure declined from an average of Rs 545.5 in 1970-72&#13;
to Rs 530.8 in 1975-77 or, by 2.7 percent. Assuming an expenditure elasticity&#13;
of 0.5 1/ for foodgrains and price elasticity -0.34, this would result in an&#13;
increase in per capita consumption of foodgrains attributable to income and&#13;
prices of only 0.3 kg (to 169.7 kg), or a total net availability of 103.4&#13;
million tons.&#13;
29.       It is quite possible that the allowance of a constant 12.5 percent&#13;
of the produce for seed, feed and wastage and inability to account for stocks&#13;
held by private traders and producers may have introduced, at least to some&#13;
degree, a downward bias in the estimates of per capita consumption/availability&#13;
derived from the FBS. Also, failure to incorporate some of the technological&#13;
advances in rice milling (11) in the estimates of rice production, particularly&#13;
when converting from paddy to milled rice, may have led to underreporting of&#13;
rice availability. Evidence and logic suggest that these may partially&#13;
explain the apparent drop in consumption. For example, wastage is likely to&#13;
be a declining function of time; also seed requirements are much lower with&#13;
the introduction of HYV's; the quantities fed to livestock particularly&#13;
grain are reported to have gone down. Hence, allowance of a constant 12.5&#13;
percent may be erroneous. Similarly, private stocks, in the wake of a com-&#13;
fortable food situation in 1975-77 may have gone down, thereby making more&#13;
1/   Expenditure elasticities are generally higher than income elasticities.&#13;
If Q represents quantity consumed, Y the income and X represents the&#13;
total consumer expenditure, then income elasticity = (dLogQ/d LogY) =&#13;
(dlogQ/d logX) x (dlogX/dlogY). The first factor on the right side is&#13;
the expenditure elasticity and the second factor is the elasticity of&#13;
total expenditure which is generally less than 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
foodgrains available. 1/ And finally, there is evidence to suggest that the&#13;
rice/paddy ratio may have gone up from 66.67 percent normally adopted to&#13;
68 percent with the increased adoption of par boiling and modern rice milling&#13;
methods. All these may warrant an upward revision in the official availability&#13;
figures.&#13;
30.       The actual availability during 1975-77 according to official FBS&#13;
estimate was 96.8 million tons. To this may be added 1.5 million tons to&#13;
allow for overestimation in seed, feed and wastage and underestimation in&#13;
rice milling percentage and around 2 million tons due to changes in private&#13;
stocks, bringing the total to 100.3 million tons as against 103.4 million&#13;
tons estimated earlier. Unless the difference between these two is fully&#13;
explained by possible underestimation in production, the possibility of&#13;
a slight decline in the per capita availability cannot be ruled out. It&#13;
may, however, be cautioned that the small differences may not be statistic-&#13;
ally significant, keeping in view the fact that all the parameters considered&#13;
in estimating the growth in demand have some standard errors attached to&#13;
them, even if no bias in their mean value is assumed.&#13;
National Sample Survey Data&#13;
31.       Evidence of a gradual decline in per capita consumption of food-&#13;
grains over time comes out very clearly from the NSS data (Table 7). The&#13;
NSS data, unlike the FBS, show a decline beginning as early as 1961/62.&#13;
These data, since they report on actual consumption, are not affected by&#13;
any overestimation/underestimation in official statistics in the same way&#13;
as the availability estimates derived from the food balance sheets are.&#13;
32.       Unfortunately, data beyond 1973/74 are not yet available from the&#13;
NSS; hence, we do not know the more recent trend, if any. Nevertheless, an&#13;
analysis of past trends will provide useful additional evidence in support&#13;
of or against our preceding analysis of foodgrains consumption behavior,&#13;
done with the help of the FBS data.&#13;
1/   No reliable estimates of changes in stocks with traders and producers&#13;
are available. A rough idea of these changes can be had from the follow-&#13;
ing data. The average marketed surplus of foodgrains during 1975-77 is&#13;
believed to be around 34-35 million tons (about 30 percent of production);&#13;
of this government procurement was of the order of 10 to 11 million tons.&#13;
This left 24 to 25 million tons which was handled by the trade. From the&#13;
size of the transactions, it is unlikely that depletion of trade stocks&#13;
between January 1975 and December 1977 could be more than 5 to 6 million&#13;
tons. Changes in stocks with producers over this period are likely to&#13;
be small. Thus, the average annual depletion of private stocks during&#13;
the period 1975-77 which were available for consumption and which were&#13;
not taken into account by the FBS approach might be of the order of&#13;
2 million tons.&#13;

33.       The NSS data are amenable to rigorous statistical examination.&#13;
Hence, we started off by asking the following questions: Is the decline&#13;
in consumption statistically significant? A comparison of two regression&#13;
lines, based on 1964/65 and 1973/74 data (Table 8) of the form C = f(E),&#13;
where C stands for per capita consumption and E for per capita expenditure&#13;
shows that the Engel curves derived from the two sets of data are signifi-&#13;
cantly different from each other. The results are summarized in Table 9.&#13;
"F" values, which test significance of differences with respect to intercept,&#13;
slope and total regression (12), are all statistically significant.&#13;
34.       To the extent that expenditure can be used as a proxy for income,&#13;
Figure 4 reveals no significant difference in income distribution between&#13;
1964/65 and 1973/74. If any, there seems to be slight improvement in 1973/74&#13;
(see Table 10). In other words, the decline in foodgrain consumption in&#13;
1973/74 cannot be attributed to a worsening of income distribution.&#13;
35.       Since the growth of urban population (whose income elasticity of&#13;
demand for foodgrains is lower than that of the rural population) is more&#13;
rapid than the total, the effect of that will also show up, ceteris paribus,&#13;
on average per capita consumption which will be lower. Between 1964/65 and&#13;
1973/74, rural/urban population ratio changed from 4.25 to 3.76; however,&#13;
when the effect of urbanization, other things held constant is estimated, it&#13;
explains only 0.10 kg/per person fall in consumption of foodgrains on the&#13;
average as against the actual fall of 1.65 kg/per capita (Table 10).&#13;

Notes:&#13;
1.   1964/65 expenditures have been converted to 1973/74 prices by using&#13;
an inflator of 2.03 for rural areas and 2.02 for urban areas. These&#13;
inflators represent changes in consumer price indices of agricultural&#13;
laborers and industrial workers, respectively, during this period.&#13;
Because of this adjustment, the class intervals are not identical&#13;
for the two periods.&#13;

a/   The assumption underlying the consumption functions is that the changes&#13;
in the real prices were uniform across the expenditure groups.&#13;
b/   C refers to per capita consumption of the commodity in question and E to&#13;
per capita total expenditure..&#13;
36.       What caused the decline in per capita consumption between 1964/65&#13;
and 1973/74? The decline, as Table 10 reveals, has taken place in all expen-&#13;
diture groups. With respect to cereals, the proportion of decline goes up&#13;
as one moves to a higher income group. The bottom 30 percent of the popula-&#13;
tion experienced practically no change, the middle 40 percent a 3.9 percent&#13;
decline, and the top 30 percent a 12.6 percent decline. The decline in&#13;
pulses was shared almost equally by all groups. Table 11 shows the extent&#13;
to which the decline can be explained by economic variables. Given the&#13;
change in per capita expenditure between 1964/65 and 1973/74 (row 2) one&#13;
would have expected the per capita consumption of foodgrains in 1973/74 to&#13;
be as shown in row 4. Clearly, this was not the case; actual consumption&#13;
was considerably less (row 6). Could this be due to an increase in real&#13;
prices? True, as row 8 reveals, real foodgrain prices did increase between&#13;
1964/65 and 1973/74. But for row 7 to be fully explained by prices, the&#13;
implied price elasticities that will have to prevail are shown in row 9.&#13;
37.       For cereals, it will be seen from the table, that the coefficient&#13;
of implied price elasticities for the average population and the bottom and&#13;
middle income groups are within an acceptable range. For the top income&#13;
group, however, this is not the case. It is possible that this group's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
tastes and preferences are shifting gradually from foodgrains to other food&#13;
over time. 1/ For cereals, by and large, it may be reasonable to conclude&#13;
that economic factors were primarily responsible for the drop in consumption&#13;
between 1964/65 and 1973/74.&#13;

38.       The case of pulses is, however, different.     An implied price&#13;
elasticity of about -1.4 across the board cannot be justified either on&#13;
theoretical (13) or empirical grounds (14). The availability of pulses during&#13;
the period had declined perceptibly and thee supply response was almost zero.&#13;
There was, on an average, a 30 percent increase in real prices and it is&#13;
quite possible that consumers were substituting other food articles (vege-&#13;
tables, milk, etc.). A simple exercise attempted in Table 12 seems to cor-&#13;
roborate this. There is a significant decline in the proportion of total&#13;
expenditure going to pulses between 1964/65 and 1973/74. Perhaps to make&#13;
up for this, all consumers spent a larger proportion of their expenditure&#13;
on food articles other than grains in 1973/74 than in 1964/65. It is worth&#13;
noting that the percentage of total expenditure spent on food was higher in&#13;
1973/74 than in 1964/65.&#13;

Discussion&#13;
40.        By and large, the findings of the FBS and NSS with regard to&#13;
trends in foodgrains consumption in India over time are not inconsistent&#13;
in the sense that they are largely explained by the behavior of economic&#13;
forces. This became clear from the FBS data when adjustments were made to&#13;
take into account some of the weaknesses of the data. With NSS data also,&#13;
except for the top 30 percent of the population, economic forces largely&#13;
explain the drop in consumption of cereals between 1964/65 and 1973/74.&#13;
In other words, declining per capita consumption over time does not suggest&#13;
that a shift has taken place in the demand schedule over time; consumption&#13;
seems to be still moving essentially along the same demand curve. However,&#13;
from this study, it is also clear that the information required to arrive at&#13;
definite conclusions on this subject is far from adequate. The following,&#13;
in particular, deserve immediate attention:&#13;
(i)  Updating of the ratios used for converting gross production&#13;
of foodgrains to net production by way of allowances for&#13;
seed, feed and wastage;&#13;
(ii)  Analysis of.data from field trials for working out response&#13;
ratios for irrigation and fertilizer at the state level for&#13;
the different crops and all foodgrains;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(iii) Studies on estimates of changes in stocks with private traders&#13;
and producers; and finally,&#13;
(iv) Early publication of the NSS consumer expenditure data for&#13;
1977/78.&#13;
Statewise Analysis of Per Capita Consumption&#13;
40.       An attempt is made in this section to analyze the data at the State&#13;
level to see whether per capita consumption declined uniformly in all the&#13;
States or more in deficit than in the surplus States. Both the FBS and the&#13;
NSS data were examined.&#13;
41.        Per Capita Net Availability Based on the Food Balance Sheets.&#13;
Table 13 shows the estimates of per capita net availability of cereals during&#13;
the period 1970-72 and 1975-77 for some of the States, taking into account&#13;
the net production, the contribution of the State to the central pool, the&#13;
receipts from the central pool, interstate movements by rail where there are&#13;
no movement restrictions, and the changes in stocks held by the State Govern-&#13;
ment. The table does not reveal any significant pattern of behavior in per&#13;
capita consumption in the different States over the period. This can be&#13;
attributed partly to the limitations of the method adopted for deriving the&#13;
per capita availability, as the changes in stocks relate to those with the&#13;
State Governments only and do not take into account the changes in the stocks&#13;
with producers and traders.&#13;
42.       Per Capita Consumption Based on NSS.    Quantitative estimates of per&#13;
capita consumption of foodgrains in the States based on the NSS are not avail-&#13;
able for 1964/65. Such data are available for cereals for 1963/64 on the&#13;
basis of the 18th round of the NSS. Table 14 shows the per capita consumption&#13;
of cereals in 1963/64 (Feb. 1963-Jan. 1964) and 1973/74 (July to June).&#13;
43.       The following observations can be made from an examination of the&#13;
table:&#13;
(i) There was fall in consumption between 1963/64 and 1973/74 in&#13;
all States.&#13;
(ii) The magnitude of the fall was less in urban areas than in&#13;
rural areas.&#13;
(iii)  The fall in consumption was lowest in Punjab and Andhra Pradesh&#13;
and highest in Kerala. The fall in consumption in the deficit&#13;
states of Bihar and Maharashtra was also large. In Karnataka,&#13;
Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh also, it was around 16 percent in&#13;
the rural areas. In the urban areas, the fall in Andhra Pradesh,&#13;
Tamil Nadu and Gujarat was less than 5 percent.&#13;

44.       As comparable data on quantities and expenditures are available&#13;
on a Statewise basis for rural and urban areas, an attempt has been made to&#13;
work out the implicit prices during the two periods. These are given in&#13;
Annex VIII. It will be seen that the largest fall in consumption has&#13;
occurred in States where the implicit prices have been relatively higher.&#13;
Thus, in Kerala, the implied prices of foodgrains went up 3.75 times whereas&#13;
the overall increase in price level as reflected in the consumer prices&#13;
index numbers for agricultural laborers is only 2.5 times. In Punjab and&#13;
Haryana (taken together) the implied prices and the corresponding consumer&#13;
price index both rose about 2.4 times.&#13;
5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
45.        The long term trend in foodgrain production (1961-77) in India&#13;
suggests that the annual increase in output of 2.4 percent has barely kept&#13;
pace with the average growth of population of 2.3 percent per annum. There-&#13;
fore, any increase in per capita net production during this period was modest.&#13;
46.        The foodgrain situation during the triennium 1975-77 was, however,&#13;
somewhat different. Average production of 110.8 million tons was higher than&#13;
that achieved in the past in any single year or any three year average. Stocks&#13;
were at their highest level ever and real prices were declining. However, in&#13;
spite of a comfortable food situation, per capita consumption or availability&#13;
during 1975-77 was lower than in 1970-72 or even in 1960-62. Domestic pro-&#13;
duction was enough to meet the demand and all imports were used to build up&#13;
stocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
47.        This study analyses the trends in foodgrain consumption and the&#13;
factors that influence it in an attempt to reconcile an apparent decline&#13;
in per capita consumption since the early 1960s with a slow but steady rise&#13;
in per capita income. There are two sets of data which can be analyzed:&#13;
National Sample Survey (NSS) expenditure and consumption data and the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture's estimates of apparent consumption derived from production&#13;
estimates. National Sample Survey statistics are available only through&#13;
1973/74 while the apparent consumption estimates are available through 1977.&#13;
48.        The NSS data show a fall in per capita consumption of 10 percent&#13;
between 1964/65 and 1973/74 with the upper 30 percent registering a larger&#13;
fall than the bottom 30 percent. The data indicate that this fall occurred&#13;
despite a rise in per capita income without any deterioration in income&#13;
distribution. The fall during this period is best explained by a rise in&#13;
the real price of food over the period.&#13;
49.        The Ministry of Agriculture data can be used to analyze consump-&#13;
tion trends after the early 1970s.    These data show a fall in per capita&#13;
consumption of 6 percent between 1970-72 and 1975-77, despite a rise in per&#13;
capita income of 3 percent and a fall in the real price of foodgrains of 5&#13;
percent during the same period. The total consumption of foodgrain would&#13;
have to have been 10 percent higher than it apparently was to be consistent&#13;
with the income and price changes. It is highly unlikely that either a shift&#13;
in tastes away from foodgrains or a deterioration in the distribution of&#13;
income contributed significantly to the fall.    One possible explanation&#13;
remaining is that the savings/income ratio has changed over the period. A&#13;
second possible explanation is that there is some defect in the data used&#13;
to estimate apparent consumption from production estimates.&#13;
50.       The savings/income ratio did change significantly over the period.&#13;
Saving as a percent of Gross Domestic Product rose from 13% in 1970-72 to&#13;
18% in 1975-77 with the result per capita expenditure declined by 3% over&#13;
the period despite a rise in income. Adding this change in saving behavior&#13;
to the price and income shifts changes the expected level of consumption so&#13;
that the apparent consumption is only 7% less than would have been expected&#13;
from income, price and saving behavior.&#13;
51.       Although there is little evidence that foodgrain production has&#13;
been underestimated to any significant extent, the data suggest the possible&#13;
underestimation by a minor amount, which could explain a part of the differ-&#13;
ence. Two different approaches in checking for underestimation of production&#13;
showed strikingly similar results -- that production may be under-estimated&#13;
by just over 3 million tons. If consumption were in fact 3 million tons&#13;
greater than estimated, the difference between the actual and expected con-&#13;
sumption would be less than 4 percent. This level of difference is small&#13;
and well within the margin of error of various adjustments made to production&#13;
data to derive consumption estimates.&#13;
52.       An analysis of the per capita consumption of cereals in the States&#13;
between 1963/64 and 1973/74 shows a fall in consumption in almost all States&#13;
but a proportionately larger fall in the deficit States than in the surplus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
States. This may be attributed to a relatively larger rise in the implicit&#13;
prices of cereals in the deficit States as compared to the surplus States.&#13;
53.        A more detailed analysis Statewise, and by expenditure groups is&#13;
necessary to find out whether the observed pattern of fall at the all-India&#13;
level in the different expenditure groups is shown in the surplus and deficit&#13;
States as well. In order to ensure that demand does not act as a constraint&#13;
to growth in foodgrain production, more attention has to be paid to price&#13;
levels in the deficit States which could be achieved through improved dis-&#13;
tribution arrangements, particularly in the rural areas of deficit States. 1/&#13;

Note on Methods of Estimation of Area and Yield of Crops in India&#13;
1.        In India, estimates of foodgrains production are obtained as a&#13;
product of the area under the crop and the yield per hectare. The estimates&#13;
of area under the crop are generally framed on the basis of complete field&#13;
to field enumeration, based on crop inspection done by the village revenue&#13;
agency in each crop season in all the States except West Bengal, Orissa, and&#13;
Kerala, where these data are based on sample surveys. The estimates of yield&#13;
per hectare are based on crop cutting surveys using random sampling techniques.&#13;
In all, over 120,000 crop cutting experiments are conducted each year for&#13;
foodgrains alone. Both methods are methodologically sound. In actual field&#13;
implementation, however, it has been found that some deficiencies have&#13;
cropped up in both.&#13;
2.        The National Commission on Agriculture came to the conclusion that&#13;
the estimates of foodgrain production furnished by some of the States for the&#13;
period 1967/68 to 1969/70 were unsatisfactory mainly because of the defects&#13;
in the field implementation of methodology. This conclusion is also supported&#13;
by the evidence based on all-India estimates of consumption derived from the&#13;
figures-of net availability of foodgrains, changes in per capita incomes, real&#13;
prices and income and price elasticities of demand. This analysis done for&#13;
the period of 1967/68 to 1973/74 showed that the estimated figures of gross&#13;
production based on consumption are nearer the Central Government's adjusted&#13;
estimates, and, are, in fact even higher, in some cases, than the figures&#13;
obtained by totalling the State Governments' estimates. The Commission also&#13;
observed that this method did not give an objective basis for correcting the&#13;
State Governments' estimates.&#13;
3.        The Commission recommended some measures designed to improve the&#13;
reliability of crop estimates. These have been incorporated in the "Scheme&#13;
for Improvement of Crop Statistics," which provides for a sample check of area&#13;
enumeration and crop cutting experiments in about 10,000 villages and 30,000&#13;
fields respectively divided equally between the Central staff of the National&#13;
Sample Survey Organization and the State statistical staff. The results of&#13;
Central and State supervisory checks are analyzed separately, compared and&#13;
pooled. Where there are large differences between these figures, the scheme&#13;
provides a basis for examining them and suggesting measures for improvement.&#13;
The scheme was initiated in 1973/74; but it will take some more time before&#13;
the improvements get fully reflected in the crop estimates, in all the States.&#13;

Note on Statistics of Irrigation&#13;
1.        Statistics of area under irrigation are available mainly from tw.'&#13;
sources: (i) Land Utilization Statistics and (ii) periodical progress reports&#13;
of Plan schemes. There are wide discrepancies between the two sets of figures.&#13;
According to Land Utilization Statistics, the gross irrigated area under all&#13;
crops went up by 25.4 m ha from 22.6 m ha in 1950/51 to 48.0 m ha estimated&#13;
in 1977/78. The achievements reported in the different Plans on the basis of&#13;
progress reports of irrigation programs, are given below:&#13;

a/   Figures refer to utilization.&#13;
2.        Not all of the difference between the two figures of 16.25 m ha&#13;
(41.65-25.4) can be explained by depreciation in minor irrigation schemes&#13;
and overlapping between major and minor schemes. If this is indeed so, the&#13;
effective cost of irrigation per hectare would have been one and a half times&#13;
higher. The other conclusion is that the irrigation statistics do not fully&#13;
reflect the additional benefits from irrigation schemes. The method of esti-&#13;
mation of production potential adopted in this paper makes an implicit&#13;
assumption that the irrigation benefits are fully reflected. This aspect&#13;
requires further study.&#13;

ANNEX VI&#13;
Note on Methods of Estimation of Per Capita Consumption of Foodgrains&#13;
1.        An estimate of the per capita consumption of foodgrains can be&#13;
obtained either directly, by ascertaining the quantity of grains consumed&#13;
by an individual as in the National Sample Survey (NSS) and some of the&#13;
diet surveys, or indirectly, by dividing the total quantity of foodgrains&#13;
available for consumption by the total population. Estimates of per capita&#13;
availability based on the latter approach, which may be designated as the&#13;
Food Balance Sheet (FBS) approach, are available in India as a time-series.&#13;
Data on per capita consumption in quantitative terms based on the NSS are&#13;
available for a number of years, though not as a time series.&#13;
FBS Estimates&#13;
2.        FBS estimates are published separately for rice, wheat, other&#13;
cereals, gram, total pulses, and total foodgrains. 1/ The net availability&#13;
is worked out as net production (after allowing for seed, feed and waste)&#13;
plus net imports, plus or minus change in stocks.&#13;
3.        The net availability data relate to calendar years, while the&#13;
production data refer to agricultural year--July to June. It is assumed-&#13;
that production in one agricultural year is available for consumption in&#13;
the following calendar year. The data on net imports also relate to calendar&#13;
year. The changes in stocks refer to the difference between the opening and&#13;
closing stocks at the beginning and end of the calendar year, respectively&#13;
The estimate of population relates to the mid-year as on July 1 of that year.&#13;
4.        The major defect in the consumption data based on the FBS approach&#13;
is that they do not represent the actual availability for consumption during&#13;
the year, since the figures of changes in stocks refer to government stocks&#13;
only. As production fluctuates considerably from year to year the inventories&#13;
held by producers and traders vary from year to year. As collection of data&#13;
on private stocks bristles with difficulties, no serious attempt has been&#13;
made by the Government of India to collect them.&#13;
5.        Over a period of three years, which includes good and bad years,&#13;
the error in taking only the government stocks may be evened out partly&#13;
since in bad years, the producers and traders hold on to their stocks,&#13;
while in good years the reverse happens. Thus, in general, a three year&#13;
average per capita net availability will give a better indication of the&#13;
average per capita consumption than a single year's figure.&#13;
6.        With regard to estimates of production also, some caution is&#13;
necessary in utilizing published figures for the earlier years. For the&#13;
years 1949/50 to 1965/66, the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation has&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
ANNEX VI&#13;
published a series of adjusted estimates of production which allow for&#13;
changes in scope and coverage and the method adopted for collecting statis-&#13;
tics of area and production of crops to make them comparable over years.&#13;
For 1949/50, the difference between adjusted estimates and the figures as&#13;
published is 6 million tons. If unadjusted estimates of production are used,&#13;
the per capita availability will be underestimated by as much as 14 kg.&#13;
7.        With regard to the allowance for seed, feed, and wastage, a constant&#13;
figure of 12.5 percent of gross production is used. The National Commission&#13;
on Agriculture has adopted the following break up of this allowance: seed--&#13;
5%; livestock feed--5% and wastage--2-1/2% According to the figures quoted&#13;
in another source 1/, the allowances made are for seed--5.2%; livestock feed--&#13;
2.3% and wastage--5%.&#13;
8.        Grainwise break up of these figures is not separately available;&#13;
however, in working out separate figures of net availability of rice and&#13;
wheat the following allowances are made: 2/&#13;
Rice                  7.6&#13;
Wheat                12.1&#13;
Gram                 22.1&#13;
Total Cereals        12.5&#13;
Total Pulses         12.5&#13;
9.        It is not appropriate to adopt a constant percentage allowance over&#13;
a period of time. For example, while requirements for seed do go up with&#13;
increase in area under the crop, yields per hectare have gone up too. Hence,&#13;
the requirements as a percentage of production should go down. Also, the seed&#13;
rates for high yielding varieties and hybrids, which have spread rapidly in&#13;
India, are lower than those for traditional varieties, whose relative import-&#13;
ance is declining. The overall percentages should, therefore, be lower than&#13;
5 percent.&#13;
10.       The allowance of 5 percent for livestock feed is also a rough figure.&#13;
Because of a decline in production resulting in high real prices, the practice&#13;
of feeding gram to livestock may have gone down. The case of coarse grains may&#13;
be similar. On the other hand, with the development of poultry and extension&#13;
of scientific techniques of management, coarse grain fed to poultry and those&#13;
used in cattle feed mixture may have gone up. But here too, in years of acute&#13;
scarcity, when prices go up, the amounts fed to cattle and poultry decline and&#13;
to that extent larger quantities are available for human consumption.&#13;

ANNEX VI&#13;
11.       The allowance made for losses in storage is 2.5 percent.     No precise&#13;
estimate of these losses is available. Some estimates put the figures at 10&#13;
percent. What we are concerned with here is whether the adoption of a uniform&#13;
figure of 2.5 percent for storage loss is correct. With improvement in&#13;
government storage, losses with respect to grains handled by the government&#13;
should decline. Keeping in view the high grain prices, there is reason&#13;
to believe that losses in storage at the farm level and at the trader's&#13;
level will have also declined.&#13;
12.       It is difficult to give even a rough estimate for the net effect&#13;
of the likely trends in the allowances for seed, feed and wastage discussed&#13;
above on the overall percentage.    However, a one million ton variation in&#13;
this figure will imply a variation of 1.6 kg per capita.&#13;
13.       The figures of production of paddy are reported in terms of rice,&#13;
using a conversion factor of 66 and 2/3 percent. As a result of the adoption&#13;
of modern milling methods, and also of increased adoption of parboiling of&#13;
rice, this percentage is reported to have gone up to 70 percent. The average&#13;
conversion factor may be taken to be 68 percent. The average production of&#13;
paddy.in 1975-77 was about 65 million tons. The additional rice that would&#13;
have been available for c-onsumption would be of the order of 0.87 million&#13;
tons.&#13;
14.       Statewise data on net availability of foodgrains are not worked out&#13;
mainly for want of reliable data on interstate movement, particularly by road.&#13;
However, some rough estimates of the net availability of cereals in each State&#13;
can be compiled by taking into account procurement by the State for the Central&#13;
pool, issues to the State from the Central pool, changes in stocks of cereals&#13;
with the State Government and net production of cereals in each State. In&#13;
areas where there are no restrictions on interstate movement of grains, data&#13;
on rail borne trade can also be used to make adjustments in the net avail-&#13;
ability as worked out on the basis of data on movements on government account.&#13;
NSS Estimates&#13;
15.       The NSS estimates of per capita consumption are obtained through&#13;
socio-economic enquiries conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization.&#13;
The data are collected by trained whole time investigators of the NSSO using&#13;
a well structured questionnaire from the respondents, by the interview method.&#13;
Before 1973/74 (28th round) the consumption schedule was canvassed every year.&#13;
Data on consumption in quantitative terms ar-e published only for selected&#13;
years; the latest available data relate to 1973/74. The results of the 32nd&#13;
round (1977/78) consumption survey are expected to be available only next&#13;
year.&#13;
16.       Considerable caution is necessary in using the NSS data on per&#13;
capita consumption of cereals and pulses and total consumer expenditure&#13;
for the following reasons:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
ANNEX VI&#13;
(i) The total consumption of foodgrains (cereals and pulses)&#13;
calculated from the per capita availability does not&#13;
tally with the estimates of net availability of food-&#13;
grains in different years, the former being considerably&#13;
higher than the latter. The difference between the two&#13;
sets of figures is coming down.&#13;
(ii) The estimates of per capita private consumption expenditure&#13;
based on the NSS data are much lower than the corresponding&#13;
official estimates of private consumption expenditure based&#13;
on the National Accounts from 1963/64 on. The difference&#13;
between the two is increasing. 1/&#13;
(iii) It is well known that in the lower income groups, expenditure&#13;
on foodgrains accounts for a much larger proportion of the&#13;
total consumer expenditure, compared to the higher income&#13;
groups. There is reason to believe that the consumption of&#13;
foodgrains in the former is underestimated and in the latter&#13;
overestimated, mainly because some of the family members in&#13;
the low income households eat outside and in the higher&#13;
income households, guests, etc. who are not regular members&#13;
of the household also partake in the food. This is likely&#13;
to introduce a non-uniform non-sampling error in the consump-&#13;
tion expenditure in the different groups. 2/ The data on&#13;
per capita calorie intake of different expenditure groups&#13;
in rural areas based on the 26th round which show a varia-&#13;
tion from 1,493 calories in the lowest group to 6,181 calories&#13;
in the highest group confirm this belief.&#13;

May 1978, p. 21.&#13;
2/   This may not introduce any bias in the aggregate consumption, as&#13;
long as every individual's consumption is accounted for in some&#13;
household.&#13;

            Behavior of foodgrain production and
            consumption in India 1960-77
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The apparent per capita consumption of
            foodgrains in India during 1975-77 was below that in
            1970-72, or even 1960-62, despite trend increases in average
            per capita income of more than 1 percent per annum since at
            least 1960. Several explanations are possible: that the
            consumption is underestimated either because production is
            underestimated or the adjustments made to production
            estimates to derive consumption are incorrect; or that
            consumption did decline because of changes in the real price
            of foodgrain, adverse changes in the distribution of income,
            changes in tastes or other reasons. The paper concludes that
            movements in price, income and savings constitute a
            significant part of the explanation. Underestimation of
            production cannot be a large part of the explanation,
            although production may be underestimated by a small amount.
            A part of the explanation may well be in unrecorded stock
            changes or overadjustments for feed, seed and wastes in
            estimating consumption from production estimates. A more
            complete picture will be available only when the National
            Sample Survey results of the 1977/78 round of consumption
            surveys are published.
