Administration Agreement and will not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement will be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") will be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to&#13;
finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge&#13;
that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset&#13;

Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be accounted for as a single trust fund and will be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be commingled&#13;
with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the&#13;
funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;

Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank will convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;
the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor will bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;

3.2    In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management and&#13;
Trust Fund administration, that are: (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee; and (ii) not included under Annex I of the Administration Agreements in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures will be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a&#13;
maximum of ten percent (10%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.2 3 Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;
Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to&#13;
request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable&#13;
to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration&#13;
Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reaorting&#13;

made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
4.3    The Bank will provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure website,&#13;
within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit report, comprising:&#13;

external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank will first consult as to whether such an external&#13;
audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor will agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of&#13;

external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such&#13;
audit, will be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;

of such review or evaluation, and the Bank will provide all relevant information within the limits of the&#13;
Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank,&#13;
will be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a&#13;
financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;

6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by&#13;
December 31, 2019 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank will only disburse funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date&#13;
to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration Agreements&#13;
of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank will return any remaining balance of the&#13;

and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant&#13;
Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank will return to the&#13;
relevant Donor or Donors in the Holding Currency in the manner specified by each such Donor in its&#13;
respective Administration Agreement the pro rata share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the Trust&#13;
Fund, in accordance with any additional terms that may be agreed between the Bank and each such Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure: Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The Bank will disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this Trust Fund in&#13;

committee responsible for policy oversight, resource mobilization, and project/grant approvals; and&#13;

Fund; technical oversight and quality control for Trust Fund funded projects in accordance with Bank&#13;
