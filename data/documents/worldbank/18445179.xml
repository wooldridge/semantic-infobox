    This year, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s operating income was $55 million, compared with $49 million in FY07. The increase of $6 million&#13;
    was due to an increase in net premium income and investment income and a decrease in the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s administrative&#13;
    expenses. FY08 net income increased by $3.4 million compared to FY07, primarily due to higher guarantee income and&#13;
    investment income and translation gains. (See MD&amp;A for details.)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
This year marks MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s 20th anniversary. The agency was&#13;
formed to contribute to the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s mission&#13;
of overcoming poverty by encouraging foreign direct&#13;
investments (FDI) into underserved emerging markets. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
political risk insurance complements the product offerings&#13;
of the rest of the World Bank Group, by facilitating devel-&#13;
opment projects in economies that do not attract foreign&#13;
capital easilyâ&#128;&#148;countries in sub-Saharan Africa, post-conflict&#13;
states, and the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poorest states. For twenty years, now,&#13;
MIGA has been a steadfast partner for the Bank Group.&#13;

One hundred days into his tenure as President of the World&#13;

a number of key challenges facing the developing world. At the&#13;
core of the agenda is the belief that globalization offers oppor-&#13;
tunities that are threatened by exclusion, grinding poverty, and&#13;
environmental damage. The global community has a responsi-&#13;
bility to ensure that the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poorest are not left behind by&#13;
globalizationâ&#128;&#148;as a matter of respect for the worth of our fellow&#13;

Fiscal year 2008 was a very good year for MIGA, with new guarantee&#13;
issuance reaching $2.1 billion. This is the largest amount of new&#13;
gross exposure in MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s history. The increase in coverage represents&#13;
the fourth consecutive year of growth in the amount of guarantees&#13;
issued by the agency. The coverage reflects MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s focus on sup-&#13;
porting projects in countries that carry a higher perception of riskâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
including in Africa, IDA-eligible and conflict-affected countriesâ&#128;&#148;&#13;

investors and client countries to help them resolve disputes and keep&#13;

Afghanistan   Project Name: BRAC Afghanistan Bank&#13;
              Guarantee Holder: ShoreCap International Ltd.&#13;
&#13;
              MIGA issued a guarantee of $112,500 to ShoreCap International (SCI) of the Cayman Islands covering its&#13;
              equity investment in BRAC Afghanistan Bank. An additional amount of $112,500 was guaranteed by the MIGA-&#13;
              administered Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility. The coverage is for a period of up to ten years against the&#13;
              risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance. ShoreCapâ&#128;&#153;s investment of $1 million into&#13;
              the Afghan bank in 2006 was also covered by a MIGA guarantee against the same risks.&#13;
&#13;
              The additional capital invested by SCI and three foreign sponsors, including the IFC, into BRAC Afghanistan Bank&#13;
              will increase the bankâ&#128;&#153;s capital base, fund infrastructure investments in additional branches, automated teller&#13;
              machines and point of sale devices, and leverage a small business loan portfolio which is expected to grow sub-&#13;
              stantially.&#13;
&#13;
              The project is expected to have a significant impact on the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic development as it will provide&#13;
              financing and savings instruments to micro-enterprises, which form the largest underserved segment of the local&#13;
              economy. Greater access to financial services will help reduce poverty and expand economic opportunity for low-&#13;
              income populations throughout Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
              MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s support in establishing a for-profit, national, and fully regulated microfinance bank is expected to help dem-&#13;
              onstrate the profitability and sustainability of large-scale financial services to new microfinance providers. This will&#13;
              help encourage new entrants and improve overall services in the financial services sector for Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s poor.&#13;
              The project was underwritten through MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Small Investment Program and is aligned with MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s priority of&#13;
              supporting investment in conflict-affected nations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Project Name: Geo Building Technologies LLC, Afghanistan&#13;
              Guarantee Holder: International Home Finance &amp; Development, LLC&#13;
&#13;
              MIGA issued guarantees totaling $0.87 million to International Home Finance &amp; Development, LLC of the U.S.,&#13;
              covering its equity investment in, and shareholder loans to, Geo Building Technologies in Afghanistan. Another&#13;
              $0.87 million is being guaranteed by the MIGA-administered Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility. The&#13;
              coverage is for a period of up to seven years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil&#13;
              disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
              Geo Building Technologies is introducing â&#128;&#156;GreenMachineâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;GeoBricksâ&#128;&#157; in Afghanistan. The GreenMachine is&#13;
              a portable, self-powered system designed to manufacture compressed-earth blocks called GeoBricks. The project&#13;
              enterprise plans to establish stationary and mobile manufacturing plants across the country, as well as offer&#13;
              GreenMachine equipment for rental and sale.&#13;
&#13;
              After more than two decades of conflict, Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s reconstruction efforts are being carried out at a fast pace,&#13;
              with the government, donor agencies, and the private sector investing billions of dollars in the construction of&#13;
              public buildings and other infrastructure in the country. As a result, the demand for primary construction material,&#13;
              such as bricks, has more than doubled in the last three years. The project is expected to provide builders in&#13;
              Afghanistan with a lower cost, higher quality, and more energy efficient alternative to the building materials cur-&#13;
              rently in use.&#13;
&#13;
              MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s support for this investment is aligned with the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s country assistance strategy in&#13;
              Afghanistan, which aims to support the development of a competitive private sector. The project is expected to&#13;
              create significant employment opportunities and strengthen the sustainability and safety of buildings through the&#13;
              use of higher-quality basic building material. More than 10,000 direct jobs will be created during the first five years&#13;
              of operation. By offsetting carbon emissions, the proposed project is expected to receive carbon credits for every&#13;
              GeoBrick manufactured by the GreenMachine.&#13;
&#13;
              MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s participation in the project is aligned with key agency priorities: encouraging investment in conflict-affected&#13;
              and IDA-eligible (the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poorest) nations.&#13;

&#13;
                        MIGA issued a guarantee of e25 million ($35.6 equivalent) to Habib Bank AG Zurich (HBZ), covering a portion of&#13;
                        its equity investment into Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited (HMB) in Pakistan. HBZâ&#128;&#153;s investment is in the form&#13;
                        of reinvested retained earnings, and MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s guarantee is for a period of up to 20 years against the risks of transfer&#13;
                        restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
                        This is the sixth guarantee that MIGA has provided to HBZ in support of the expansion and growth of its branch&#13;
                        operations in Pakistan. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s guarantee will help the bank implement a multi-pronged strategy to: (1) restructure&#13;
                        and expand HMBâ&#128;&#153;s branch network to over 120 offices by 2010; (2) improve product quality and innovation; (3)&#13;
                        accelerate growth in consumer and Islamic banking; and (4) improve control, efficiency, and build operations&#13;
                        capacity. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s continued support is considered critical to the investor. The project will help contribute to the&#13;
                        overall strength of Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s banking sectorâ&#128;&#148;one of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s top reform priorities.&#13;
&#13;
                        MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s support is also aligned with the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s strategy in Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s financial sector, which aims&#13;
                        at increasing competition and expanding access to financial services to different segments of the population.&#13;
                        The sector still suffers from low banking penetration and limited access to finance, especially with respect to the&#13;
                        provision of banking services to underserved segments, including small and medium enterprises, consumer and&#13;
                        housing finance, microfinance, and rural finance.&#13;

                       MIGA issued a guarantee of $1.12 million to Coprotec Systeme GmbH of Germany for a shareholder loan to its&#13;
                       wholly owned subsidiary, Coprotec Sistemi d.o.o. Orasje. The guarantee covers the risk of transfer restriction,&#13;
                       expropriation, and war and civil disturbance for a period of up to eight years.&#13;
&#13;
                       Coprotec Sistemi d.o.o. Orasje will establish a greenfield manufacturing facility in the Posavina Canton area of&#13;
                       northern Bosnia and Herzegovina. The factory will manufacture high-grade processed steel components for&#13;
                       export to the automobile industry (parts and vehicle manufacturers) in Germany.&#13;
&#13;
                       MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s support for this investment is aligned with the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s country assistance strategy in&#13;
                       Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly with regard to supporting the development of a competitive private sector.&#13;
                       Moreover, the transfer of high-tech manufacturing and quality control processes and precision equipment to the&#13;
                       project company is expected to yield positive benefits for local staff.&#13;
&#13;
                       MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s participation in the project is aligned with key agency priorities, including encouraging investment in&#13;
                       conflict-affected and IDA-eligible countries. The project was underwritten through MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Small Investment&#13;

&#13;
                       MIGA issued a guarantee of $47.5 million to Raiffeisen Zentralbank Ã&#150;sterreich AG (RZB) covering its shareholder&#13;
                       loan of $50 million to Raiffeisen Leasing Kazakhstan LLP (RLKZ). The guarantee covers the risks of transfer&#13;
                       restriction and expropriation of funds for a period of up to six years.&#13;
&#13;
                       RZBâ&#128;&#153;s shareholder loan will enable RLKZ to expand its leasing portfolio and help strengthen the financial sector in&#13;
                       general and the leasing sector in particular. It will enable RLKZ to provide customers with an alternative financing&#13;
                       instrument with longer tenor and potentially more attractive pricing. The new funds will allow RLKZ to expand its&#13;
                       portfolio and improve the growth potential of small and medium-size enterprises by facilitating the upgrade of their&#13;
                       long-term assets and improving their competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                       The guarantee represents MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s first support to RZBâ&#128;&#153;s leasing operation in Kazakhstan and its third guarantee in&#13;
                       the country. Political risk mitigation was a key requirement for RZB to proceed with the investment. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s support&#13;
                       will allow the project sponsor to fund its subsidiary at a critical time when financial institutions are facing diffi-&#13;
                       culties in raising external capital due to the global credit crisis. The project is expected to help improve the leasing&#13;
                       environment and develop a vibrant and competitive leasing industry in the country.&#13;
&#13;
                       MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s support to the project is critical not just in encouraging the growth of financial markets in Kazakhstan, but&#13;
                       also in building market confidence. It addresses one of the main priorities envisaged in the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                       country assistance strategy for Kazakhstanâ&#128;&#148;supporting the diversification of its economy and improving its com-&#13;
                       petitiveness. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s support for RZB also complements the IFCâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to strengthen the existing leasing sector&#13;
                       and facilitate medium- and longer-term financing in Kazakhstan.&#13;

Country      Activities&#13;
&#13;
             (conâ&#128;&#153;td) This project constitutes the start-up phase of Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB) Groupâ&#128;&#153;s leasing operations in&#13;
             Moldova, undertaken by its Moldovan subsidiary, RLM. Vehicles, such as trucks, trailers, and industrial equipment,&#13;
             are expected to make up 60 percent of RLMâ&#128;&#153;s portfolio, with passenger cars (including vans and buses up to 3.5&#13;
             tons) making up the balance. Fifty percent or more of the total number of borrowers supported by this investment&#13;
             are expected to be small and medium-size enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
             This project is expected to contribute to the development of the financial sector in Moldova by improving access&#13;
             to finance, particularly to segments of the economy that are currently underserved. The shareholder loan will allow&#13;
             RLM to start its leasing operations and contribute towards meeting the rapidly growing demand for leasing services&#13;
             in Moldova.&#13;
&#13;
             The financial sector of Moldova will also benefit from the presence of an experienced foreign banking institution&#13;
             like RZB Group, in terms of strengthening standards by establishing best practices, developing new products, and&#13;
             fostering competition among financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
             The World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s country assistance strategy for Moldova places emphasis on the need to help develop and&#13;
             expand the private sector, particularly SMEs, and to broaden financial sector intermediation in the country.&#13;
&#13;
             This is MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s first guarantee in support of foreign investment in the Moldovan leasing sector. This is also MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
             first guarantee for a Romanian investor and the first guarantee in support of RZB Groupâ&#128;&#153;s operations in Moldova.&#13;

Russian      Project Name: OOO Raiffeisen Leasing&#13;
Federation   Guarantee Holder: Raiffeisen Zentralbank Ã&#150;sterreich AG&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA issued $70.8 million in guarantees for two shareholder loans made by Raiffeisen Zentralbank Ã&#150;sterreich&#13;
             AG to its subsidiary OOO Raiffeisen Leasing in the Russian Federation. The guarantees cover the risks of transfer&#13;
             restriction and expropriation of funds for a period of just over five years.&#13;
&#13;
             RZBâ&#128;&#153;s shareholder loans to its subsidiary will provide OOO Raiffeisen Leasing with the necessary funds to expand&#13;
             its leasing portfolio, improve the range and quality of its leasing services, and continue its regional expansion. The&#13;
             loan proceeds are expected to be used primarily for the funding of leases of industrial equipment and transport&#13;
             infrastructure. The increased availability of equipment will help facilitate private sector investment at the regional&#13;
             level.&#13;
&#13;
             One of the main objectives of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s country partnership strategy for the Russian Federation is to&#13;
             support the development of the financial sector. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s participation in this project is, therefore, aligned with the&#13;
             Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s strategy in the country.&#13;

Turkey       Project Name: Bank in Turkey&#13;
             Guarantee Holder: Financial Institution&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA issued a guarantee of $536.8 million to cover a $565 million shareholder loan to a bank in Turkey. The&#13;
             guarantee covers the risk of transfer restriction for just over five years. MIGA has reinsured $286.75 million of this&#13;
             guarantee under the facultative reinsurance program.&#13;
&#13;
             The shareholder loan will provide the bank in Turkey with the resources needed to expand the volume and range&#13;
             of products of its lending portfolio. In particular, it will offer more scope for financing services and longer tenors to&#13;
             SMEs. The SME sector is vital to Turkeyâ&#128;&#153;s economyâ&#128;&#148;accounting for 61 percent of total employment. The expansion&#13;
             will also allow the bank to offer more residential and commercial mortgages.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s support for this transaction underpins the first pillar of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s country partnership&#13;
             strategy for Turkeyâ&#128;&#148;improved competitiveness and employment opportunities. This includes establishing a&#13;
             favorable business environment and facilitating broader access to credit for the private sector, including SMEs.&#13;

&#13;
                        MIGA issued guarantees totaling $21.04 million to Can-Pack S.A. of Poland covering its equity investment, share-&#13;
                        holder loan, and management contract with Can-Pack (Ukraine) Ltd. The coverage is against the risks of transfer&#13;
                        restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance. The equity investment and management contract will be&#13;
                        covered for a period of up to ten years. The duration of the coverage under the shareholder loan will be four years.&#13;
&#13;
                        The project involves the expansion of an existing aluminum beverage can production plant in Vyshgorod, Ukraine&#13;
                        for which MIGA is currently providing coverage (see http://www.miga.org/canpackukraine06 for details). MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                        coverage is being modified to cover an increase in the equity investment, a management contract with the project&#13;
                        enterprise, and the issuance of a new shareholder loan to the project.&#13;
&#13;
                        The plant has been operating since 2003. The expansion of the production line will include the installation,&#13;
                        assembly and operation of new equipment. The expansion will increase the plantâ&#128;&#153;s production capacity from the&#13;
                        current 1,700 cans per minute to 2,400â&#128;&#148;an increase from 650 million to 950 million cans per year. To accom-&#13;
                        modate the increase in finished products and materials, a new warehouse will be built on land adjacent to the&#13;
                        existing plant.&#13;
&#13;
                        Can-Pack S.A.â&#128;&#148;through subsidiary Can Pack Ukraine Ltd.â&#128;&#148;is the largest producer of beverage cans in Ukraine and&#13;
                        fourth largest beverage can producer in Europe. The increase in production capacity is expected to help the project&#13;
                        company meet the growing demand for canned beverages in Ukraine and maintain its market share in the country,&#13;
                        as well as Kazakhstan, Georgia, Russia and other CIS countries.&#13;
&#13;
                        The project is expected to create local employment during the construction and design phases of the new&#13;
                        expansion, as well as for the operation of new equipment. The transfer of high-tech manufacturing equipment&#13;
                        from Poland is expected to yield positive developmental benefits in the form of training for local staff, for which an&#13;
                        annual budget of $200,000 has been allocated. The expansion is also expected to generate tax revenues of approxi-&#13;
                        mately $7.5 million in present value terms over 11 years of operation. Downstream effects are expected to include&#13;
                        approximately $3.6 million in goods and services procured locally.&#13;

                        Improving competitiveness and supporting the modernization of production is a priority area for World Bank&#13;

                        MIGA issued a guarantee of $380 million to Raiffeisen Zentralbank Ã&#150;sterreich AG of Austria, covering its share-&#13;
                        holder loan of $400 million to its subsidiary, OJSC Raiffeisen Bank Aval. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s guarantee provides coverage&#13;
                        against the risks of transfer restriction and expropriation of funds for a period of up to six years.&#13;
&#13;
                        RZBâ&#128;&#153;s shareholder loan will provide funding to Raiffeisen Bank Aval to enable it to expand its portfolio and improve&#13;
                        the range and quality of its banking services. Proceeds of the loan are expected to be on-lent primarily to indi-&#13;
                        viduals and small and medium-size enterprises, mostly for long-term assets such as residential and commercial&#13;
                        mortgages.&#13;
&#13;
                        The retail business potential of Ukrainian banks is currently limited by a shortage of long-term funding in the local&#13;
                        market. The loan from RZB is designed to provide Raiffeisen Bank Aval, the second largest lender in the country,&#13;
                        with the long-term funding needed to increase its reach into underserved markets. In particular, the project is&#13;
                        expected to support the role of Raiffeisen Bank Aval as one of the market leaders in SME banking. SME loans cur-&#13;
                        rently account for about 20 percent of the bankâ&#128;&#153;s total portfolio, and in 2006, Raiffeisen Bank Aval established an&#13;
                        SME business unit.&#13;

             small and medium-size enterprises and support investment in agriculture, both of which are currently underserved&#13;
             segments of the leasing market.&#13;
&#13;
             This is MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s first guarantee in support of RZBâ&#128;&#153;s leasing operations in Ukraine. By supporting a global financial&#13;
             institutionâ&#128;&#153;s new leasing subsidiary, MIGA will also contribute to the development of the leasing sector in Ukraine.&#13;
             MIGA plays an important role in this transaction, as political risk mitigation is a key requirement for the lender to&#13;
             proceed with this investment.&#13;
&#13;
             The World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s country assistance strategy for Ukraine places a strong emphasis on improving the envi-&#13;
             ronment for private sector development and identifies building financial institutions as a priority area. The project&#13;
             is expected to help Ukraineâ&#128;&#153;s private sector gain greater access to financial products and help the country achieve&#13;
             sustainable growth. It is, therefore, consistent with the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s country partnership strategy for Ukraine.&#13;

             Project Name: Joint Stock Commercial Bank Ukrsotsbank&#13;
             Guarantee Holder: Bank Austria&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA issued a guarantee of $142.5 million to Bank Austria, a member of UniCredit Group, covering its shareholder&#13;
             loan to Joint Stock Commercial Bank Ukrsotsbank (USB) in Ukraine. The coverage is for a period of up to 11 years&#13;
             against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
             The project involves a subordinated shareholder loan of $150 million from Bank Austria to USB, Ukraineâ&#128;&#153;s fourth&#13;
             largest bank. Bank Austria is responsible for UniCredit Groupâ&#128;&#153;s operations in central and Eastern Europe and is&#13;
             USBâ&#128;&#153;s direct parent company. The loan will increase USBâ&#128;&#153;s regulatory capital which will strengthen the bank and&#13;
             allow it to grow in a sustainable manner. USB has a well-developed and expanding customer franchise and plans to&#13;
             further develop its retail and SME banking business.&#13;
&#13;
             One of the two pillars of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s country partnership strategy for Ukraine is sustaining growth and&#13;
             improving competitiveness. This encompasses the need to deepen the financial sector and to improve its stability&#13;
             in order to facilitate business growth and spur private investment. Foreign participation in Ukraineâ&#128;&#153;s banking sector&#13;
             is also expected to lead to a rapid transfer of product and credit-risk management expertise.&#13;

             MIGA issued $158.5 million in guarantees for the development of a toll road in Costa Rica. The guarantees&#13;
             are covering an equity investment by FCC ConstrucciÃ³n S.A. and Itinere Infraestructura S.A., and a share-&#13;
             holder loan by Caja Madrid. MIGA is providing 15-year coverage for the equity against the risk of transfer&#13;
             restriction. The debt will be covered for up to 18 years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation,&#13;
             war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract.&#13;
&#13;
             The project consists of the design, construction and/or rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of portions&#13;
             of the toll road linking San JosÃ© to Caldera. This 25-year concession will be the first highway concession in&#13;
             Costa Rica to successfully reach financial closing and begin operations.&#13;
&#13;
             The project is aligned with the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s strategy for Costa Rica, which includes supporting, reha-&#13;
             bilitating, and maintaining key trade corridors. The corridor connects the main industrial/business area of the&#13;
             country to one of the main ports. The project is expected to reduce transportation costs by reducing travel&#13;
             time by 1.5 hours for those who travel the full length of the corridor. It is also expected to reduce the number&#13;
             of road accidents and the costs associated with heavy traffic conditions, such as gasoline consumption and&#13;
             deterioration of vehicle parts and tires. By providing easier access to the port of Caldera, the investment will&#13;
             help improve the countryâ&#128;&#153;s trade competitiveness and may reduce the price of imports.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s participation is critical for the project to proceed since it allows mobilization of commercial bank&#13;
             financing that might otherwise not be available. It also supports MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to catalyzing private&#13;
             sector investment in infrastructure.&#13;

Algeria      Project Names: Enterprise Publique Economique de ContrÃ´le Technique Automobile (COTA)&#13;
             Guarantee Holder: SGS SA&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA issued a guarantee of $4.1 million to SGS SA of Switzerland covering its equity investment in&#13;
             Enterprise Publique Economique de ContrÃ´le Technique Automobile (COTA) in Algeria. The coverage is for a&#13;
             period of up to five years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
             The project involves the privatization of COTA, a public company established in 2001 by Algeriaâ&#128;&#153;s Ministry&#13;
             of Transport. COTAâ&#128;&#153;s role is to provide mandatory vehicle inspection throughout Algeria. SGS acquired&#13;
             a majority of COTA in 2007 and is introducing international vehicle safety standards and state-of-the-art&#13;
             inspection systems.&#13;
&#13;
             Efficient and effective vehicle inspection services are a critical element of road safety. Annually, road crashes&#13;
             kill an estimated 1.2 million people worldwide and injure 50 million more, and tend to disproportionately&#13;
             affect the poor. Vehicle inspection services are an integral part of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s transport business&#13;
             strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             The World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s country assistance strategy for Algeria commits to supporting government reform&#13;
             efforts that include fostering private participation in transport and other economic sectors. Within the next&#13;
             five years, the project is expected to generate approximately 50 new local jobs and $1.3 million in revenue for&#13;
             the government. This project was underwritten through MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Small Investment Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Djibouti     Project Names: Doraleh Container Terminal S.A.R.L.&#13;
             Guarantee Holder: DP World Djibouti FZCO, Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC, Standard Chartered Bank&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA issued guarantees to DP World Djibouti FZCO (DPW), Standard Chartered Bank (SCB), and Dubai&#13;
             Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) for their investments in Doraleh Container Terminal S.A.R.L. in Djibouti. The&#13;
             guarantees include $5 million to cover DPWâ&#128;&#153;s equity investment into the project and $422 million to cover&#13;
             funding provided by DIB, SCB, West LB and other participating banks under an Islamic project finance&#13;
             facility. The coverage is for a period of 10 years against the risks of transfer restriction, war and civil dis-&#13;
             turbance, expropriation, and breach of contract. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s gross exposure under the project is $427 million.&#13;
             The agency has reinsured $50 million with ICIEC.&#13;
&#13;
             Doraleh Container Terminal S.A.R.L. (DCT) has a 30-year concession for the development, financing, design,&#13;
             construction, management, operation, and maintenance of a new container terminal in the city of Doraleh.&#13;
             The terminal will have a total quay length of 2,000 meters and will be developed in two phases. During the&#13;
             construction phase, it is expected that approximately 350-500 local workers will be employed. On completion,&#13;
             the port will employ about 670 full-time employees. In addition to direct employment at the port, the project&#13;
             will require other services such as engineering, warehousing, spare parts, information technology and&#13;
             services, catering and cleaning, which will contribute to the local economy. The project will also lead to the&#13;
             transfer of management expertise and technology.&#13;
&#13;
             Djibouti is strategically located in East Africa along one of the fastest growing East-West international&#13;
             shipping routes. About 85 percent of imports into Djibouti are destined for the land-locked nation of Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
             By improving container facilities in Djibouti, the project will increase port traffic and open up new opportu-&#13;
             nities for investment and growth, including breaking the countryâ&#128;&#153;s reliance on Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s trade and attracting&#13;
             other African countries to use the port. A state-of-the-art container terminal could establish Djibouti as a&#13;
             gateway for the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) members, and in light of trade&#13;
             flows through that part of the world, promote regional integration through trade development.&#13;
&#13;
             This is MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s first project in Djibouti, which became a member in 2007. By supporting this project, MIGA&#13;
             will help Djibouti meet the growing volume of trade and strengthen its position as the gateway to the African&#13;
             hinterland. Development and expansion of port infrastructure is also a pillar of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
             country assistance strategy for Djibouti. This project is also consistent with MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s strategic objective of&#13;
             increasing its presence in the Middle East and North Africa region. This is a South-South investment and&#13;
             therefore aligned with another important strategic objective for MIGA.&#13;

Country       Activities&#13;
&#13;
Central       Project Name: Orange Centrafrique S.A.&#13;
African       Guarantee Holder: Orange Participations S.A.&#13;
Republic&#13;
              MIGA issued a guarantee of $38 million to Orange Participations S.A. of France, covering 90 percent of its equity&#13;
              investment (including retained earnings) in Orange Centrafrique S.A. The guarantee is for a period of up to 20&#13;
              years and will protect the investment against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil dis-&#13;
              turbance, and breach of contract.&#13;
&#13;
              The project involves the installation, operation and maintenance of a state-of-the-art telecommunications network&#13;
              operating on 100 percent digital GSM technologyâ&#128;&#148;critical to Central African Republicâ&#128;&#153;s economic development.&#13;
              Subscribers are expected to benefit from more reliable service and reduced costs due to increased competition and&#13;
              diverse product offerings.&#13;
&#13;
              The project will also set up Internet services in the country. Affordable and dependable Internet services are espe-&#13;
              cially important for businesses, residential customers, and government offices in a landlocked country like the&#13;
              Central African Republic. In many ways, access to the Internet will contribute to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s integration into&#13;
              regional and global trade and investment.&#13;
&#13;
              The project will also support the growth of other industries, including urban transportation (taxi drivers), adver-&#13;
              tising companies, print shops, information technology and software companies, construction firms, and various&#13;
              other retail and service companies. Government revenues from the project will include taxes and fees, in addition&#13;
              to the license fee.&#13;
&#13;
              This project is aligned with the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to address economic recovery in the Central African&#13;
              Republic. The country is one of the poorest in the world. Overall growth has been hampered by the countryâ&#128;&#153;s land-&#13;
              locked position, poor transport system and largely unskilled workforce.&#13;
&#13;
              This is the first project guaranteed by MIGA in the Central African Republic. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s participation in the project&#13;
              supports several agency priorities, including investment in an IDA-eligible country in sub-Saharan Africa, and&#13;
              investment in infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Democratic    Project Name: Congo Equipment SPRL.&#13;
Republic of   Guarantee Holder: Bartrac Equipment&#13;
Congo&#13;
              MIGA issued a guarantee of $25.2 million to Bartrac Equipment covering its equity investment in and shareholder&#13;
              loan to Congo Equipment SPRL in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Bartrac Equipment is a joint venture between&#13;
              two Caterpillar dealers operating in Africa, Barloworld Equipment and Tractafric Equipment. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s guarantee is for&#13;
              up to 10 years and covers the risks of war and civil disturbance, transfer restriction, and expropriation.&#13;
&#13;
              The project involves the establishment of a dealership in the Katanga province of the DRC for the distribution and&#13;
              servicing of Caterpillar earth-moving and power generating equipment. The project will directly supply equipment&#13;
              suitable for the construction and rehabilitation of road and rail links, office and residential buildings, and power&#13;
              sector installations in the Katanga province. An office block, workshop facilities, and spare parts warehouse will be&#13;
              set up at Lubumbashi, provincial capital of Katanga Province, and Kolwezi, a mining town.&#13;
&#13;
              The project will help address the infrastructure needs of the DRC, which is in a very poor state following decades&#13;
              of conflicts and economic and political instability. The earth-moving equipment will help build the countryâ&#128;&#153;s road&#13;
              network and tackle one of its biggest challengesâ&#128;&#148;traveling between provinces. Increased availability of earth-&#13;
              moving equipment and maintenance services will help enhance efficiency and productivity in the mining sector, and&#13;
              is expected to encourage downstream growth.&#13;
&#13;
              The provision and wider availability of commercial trucks, earth-moving equipment, and related services to com-&#13;
              panies are expected to improve trade and contribute to increased economic activities in the country. Finally, the&#13;
              provision of small-scale generator sets will provide much needed power to firms and individuals that are either not&#13;
              currently hooked up to the national grid or experience frequent power outages. (contâ&#128;&#153;d)&#13;

                         employees and customers, as well as off-site training in Europe, South Africa, and the U.S. The project is expected&#13;
                         to generate tax revenues for the government, estimated at more than $2 million per year for the next five years. It&#13;
                         will also contribute to the economy through local sourcing of goods and services, mostly related to transportation,&#13;
                         fuel, utilities, and housing.&#13;

                         Project Name: Congo International Company SPRL&#13;
                         Guarantee Holder: AMCO Fabrics Private Limited&#13;
&#13;
                         MIGA has issued a guarantee of $630,000 to AMCO Fabrics Private Limited, of India, covering its $700,000 equity&#13;
                         investment in Congo International Company SPRL. The coverage is for up to 10 years and covers the risks of war&#13;
                         and civil disturbance, transfer restriction, and expropriation.&#13;
&#13;
                         The project involves the installation and operation of a PVC pipe manufacturing plant on a greenfield site outside&#13;
                         Lubumbashi in Katanga Province. The initial manufacturing capacity of the plant is estimated to be a few hundred&#13;
                         tons a year. The plant will serve a market that is now entirely dependent on imports and is expected to grow as the&#13;
                         local economy stabilizes. The sponsor will also be able to offer the pipes at lower prices than imported goods due&#13;
                         to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s limited transportation infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
                         The project will create jobs and contribute to the economy through local sourcing of goods and services, mostly&#13;
                         related to transportation, fuel, utilities, and housing costs.&#13;
&#13;
                         This guarantee was underwritten through MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Small Investment Program and is aligned with the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s com-&#13;
                         mitment to supporting South-South investments, investment in sub-Saharan Africa, and investments in conflict-&#13;
                         affected countries. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s participation in this project was crucial for the investor to secure the financing needed&#13;
                         to proceed with the project.&#13;

         Guinea-Bissau   Project Name: Orange Bissau S.A.&#13;
                         Guarantee Holder: SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des TÃ©lÃ©communications du SÃ©nÃ©gal S.A.&#13;
&#13;
                         MIGA issued a guarantee of $25.9 million to SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des TÃ©lÃ©communications du SÃ©nÃ©gal S.A. (Sonatel),&#13;
                         covering its $15.1 million equity investment and $12.9 million shareholder loan in Orange Bissau S.A. The ten-year&#13;
                         coverage provides protection against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and&#13;
                         breach of contract.&#13;
&#13;
                         The project involves the installation, operation and maintenance of a 900/1800 GSM cellular network in the&#13;
                         country, as well as public pay phones and internet servicesâ&#128;&#148;critical to Guinea-Bissauâ&#128;&#153;s economic development. It&#13;
                         will be the second major cellular service provider in Guinea-Bissau to operate on a 100 percent digital GSM tech-&#13;
                         nology. This will improve quality, efficiency, and provide for a reliable mobile telephone technology. Subscribers are&#13;
                         expected to benefit from reduced costs due to increased competition and the diverse product offerings.&#13;
&#13;
                         The multiplier effects of the sector on the economy are expected to be good. The project will support the growth&#13;
                         of several industries, including urban transportation (taxi drivers), advertising companies, print shops, infor-&#13;
                         mation technology and software companies, construction firms, and various other retail and service companies.&#13;
                         Government revenues from the project will include taxes and fees.&#13;
&#13;
                         This project is aligned with the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to improve the countryâ&#128;&#153;s investment climate. Guinea-&#13;
                         Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world. Overall growth and economic diversification in the country have&#13;
                         been further hampered by a weak investment climate, including weaknesses in the telecommunications sector that&#13;
                         this project expects to address.&#13;
&#13;
                         MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s participation in this project supports several agency priorities including South-South investment,&#13;
                         investment in Africa, and investment in the infrastructure sector.&#13;

&#13;
Kenya        Project Name: OrPower 4, Inc.&#13;
             Guarantee Holder: Ormat Holding Corp.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA issued a guarantee of $88.3 million to Ormat Holding Corp., a Cayman Islands-registered subsidiary of&#13;
             Ormat Technologies, Inc., for its $98.1 million equity investment in OrPower 4, Inc. in the Republic of Kenya. The&#13;
             coverage is for up to 15 years and covers the risks of war and civil disturbance, transfer restriction, and expro-&#13;
             priation. This issuance replaces an earlier guarantee issued by the agency to cover investments into the first phase&#13;
             of the project only. The expanded guarantee covers both the first phase of the project and the investorâ&#128;&#153;s additional&#13;
             investments of $50 million for the second phase.&#13;
&#13;
             The project consists of the design, construction, management and operation of a base-load geothermal power&#13;
             plant with a combined capacity of 48MW on a Build-Own-Operate basis in the Olkaria geothermal fields of the&#13;
             Rift Valley, 50 kilometers northwest of Nairobi. Electricity generated by the plant will be sold under a 20-year power&#13;
             purchase agreement with the national power transmission and distribution utility in the countryâ&#128;&#148;the Kenya Power&#13;
             &amp; Lighting Company Limited.&#13;
&#13;
             The project is designed to alleviate the severe power shortages that have hampered economic growth in Kenya.&#13;
             Only about 15 percent of the total population in the country has access to electricity, with frequent blackouts and a&#13;
             large number of customers awaiting connections. Increased power supply is expected to contribute to economic&#13;
             growth in rural areas, thereby reducing migration to urban areas and the cities.&#13;
&#13;
             The project utilizes indigenous geothermal fuel resources, thus lowering Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s dependence on imported thermal&#13;
             energy. The project will reduce Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s exposure to fossil fuel price fluctuationsâ&#128;&#148;especially relevant in the light&#13;
             of current fuel prices of around $100 per barrel. Geothermal electricity production does not result in any of the&#13;
             conventional air pollutants associated with other fossil fuel generation options. The project is therefore expected to&#13;
             improve local and regional air quality. Other benefits include avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions.&#13;
&#13;
             The plant is situated in a rural area with high unemployment rates, and is expected to hire up to 200 new full-time&#13;
             employees and possibly up to 500 part-time employees during the construction period for the second phase. Local&#13;
             employees will benefit from a significant transfer of skills and technology. The project is also expected to contribute&#13;
             to the economy through local sourcing of goods and services.&#13;
&#13;
             This project is aligned with the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s strategy to facilitate private sector involvement in infrastructure&#13;
             development in Kenya, and it also responds to the Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s concerted efforts to promote renewable energy.&#13;
             This project meets several of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s priorities as it supports a South-South investment in the power sector in an&#13;
             IDA-eligible country in sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Madagascar   Project Name: Hydelec Madagascar S.A.&#13;
             Guarantee Holder: Energy Engineering Investment Limited&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA has issued a guarantee of $19.9 million to Energy Engineering Investment Limited of Mauritius, covering&#13;
             its equity investment in and shareholder loans to Hydelec Madagascar S.A. The coverage is for up to 15 years and&#13;
             covers war and civil disturbance, transfer restriction, and expropriation.&#13;
&#13;
             The project consists of financing, building and operating a run-of-river 15 MW hydro power facility located on the&#13;
             Sahanivotry river, 30 km south of Antsirabe, in the province of Antanarivo in Madagascar. The facility will function&#13;
             as a base load plant to feed the Antanarivo and Antsirabe grid, which suffers from chronic power cuts and load&#13;
             shedding. The expected generation cost of 4.8 c/kWh is lower than the cost of electricity currently produced by&#13;
             many existing thermal power plants.&#13;
&#13;
             The project will be implemented under a 30-year concession agreement. Electricity generated will be sold under a&#13;
             10-year power purchase agreement signed between JIRAMAâ&#128;&#148;the state-owned electricity companyâ&#128;&#148;and the project&#13;
             enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
             In the past five years, demand for electricity in Madagascar has grown at an annual average rate of approximately&#13;
             seven percent. The project is expected to help the country meet its increasing demand for power reliably and in&#13;
             a cost-effective and environment-friendly manner. This is the countryâ&#128;&#153;s first privately owned and operated hydro&#13;
             power project and is expected to pave the way for similar investments in the future. (contâ&#128;&#153;d)&#13;

&#13;
                        (contâ&#128;&#153;d) The hydroelectric power plant is expected to generate up to 70,000 MWh of power per year, thereby&#13;
                        reducing Madagascarâ&#128;&#153;s reliance on more expensive thermal power plants, as well as more expensive imported fuel.&#13;
                        Downstream effects of the project are expected to include benefits to trade and tourism, as well as the agricultural&#13;
                        and industrial sectors due to reliable electricity supply. Continued expansion in energy and electricity supply is also&#13;
                        likely to help sustain greater economic growth in the country. The project has the potential to pave the way for&#13;
                        attracting additional private capital investment flows for infrastructure development in Madagascar.&#13;
&#13;
                        Electricity sector reform in Madagascar is an important priority for the World Bank. The government of Madagascar&#13;
                        has identified hydro power generation as the preferred method of electricity generation for the country, given the&#13;
                        abundance of smaller rivers throughout the country. The project is, therefore, consistent with the Bank Group and&#13;
                        the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s strategy in Madagascar.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        Project Name: Gasy Community Network Services S.A. (G@synet)&#13;
                        Guarantee Holders: SGS S.A.&#13;
&#13;
                        MIGA issued two guarantees of $10.97 million (e7.6 million) to SGS S.A. of Switzerland, covering its loan guar-&#13;
                        anties to two banks in Madagascar for their respective loans to G@synet. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s guarantees are for a period of up&#13;
                        to 37 months and provide coverage against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance,&#13;
                        and breach of contract.&#13;
&#13;
                        The project involves the introduction of modern technology in trade transactions in Madagascar, designed to sig-&#13;
                        nificantly reduce processing time for customs clearance and cargo release; reduce the cost of trade documentation;&#13;
                        and increase the speed by which the customs service receives duty payments.&#13;
&#13;
                        The project will automate the customs clearance process in Madagascar with a software platform called TradeNet.&#13;
                        The application will link the various parties involved in external tradeâ&#128;&#148;customs, ministries, banks and tradersâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
                        into a single data network. This will eliminate duplicative and error-prone paperwork.&#13;
&#13;
                        There is also a Destination Inspection component in the project, under which three mobile inspection scanners&#13;
                        will be deployed at various ports in Madagascar. The scanners will allow non-intrusive examination of imports and&#13;
                        exports.&#13;
&#13;
                        The project will help the local business community by increasing transparency in customs clearance and tax col-&#13;
                        lection, while promoting fair and equal treatment of traders. It is expected to lead to reduced corruption opportu-&#13;
                        nities for customs staff; more accurate trade information and statistics; reduced human intervention and paper&#13;
                        handling; better detection of irregularities and fraud; and increased transparency and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
                        The project is expected to generate revenues for the government, estimated at $1.5 million per year (for each of the&#13;
                        first five years) inclusive of royalties, duties and dividends. Local staffâ&#128;&#148;expected to grow to 50 by the second yearâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
                        will receive training in network management, IT security, and the operation and maintenance of scanners.&#13;
&#13;
                        The World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s country assistance strategy for Madagascar is organized around two main pillarsâ&#128;&#148;helping&#13;
                        to remove constraints to investment and growth, and improving the scope and quality of service delivery. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                        support for the project is aligned with both. The project also matches MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s strategic objective of increasing its&#13;
                        presence in Africa, particularly in IDA-eligible countries.&#13;

                        loans, including interest. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s guarantees will protect the investments for a period of five years against the risks&#13;
                        of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance. (contâ&#128;&#153;d)&#13;

&#13;
Country      Activities&#13;
&#13;
             (contâ&#128;&#153;d) The project involves the establishment of a greenfield facility for the production of reconstituted liquid milk&#13;
             and soy milk in Ibadan, the capital city of Oyo State, in southwest Nigeria. In addition to the reconstituted milk, the&#13;
             factory will produce flavored milk and milk-juice blends manufactured from imported powdered milk and soy milk&#13;
             for the Nigerian market under the Anchor brand. The proposed facility will be fully automated with state-of-the-art,&#13;
             environmentally friendly technology.&#13;
&#13;
             The countryâ&#128;&#153;s three percent annual population growth, increasing urbanization, and rising per capita income have&#13;
             resulted in a demand for milk that exceeds domestic production. Development of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s dairy sector has&#13;
             been hampered by, among other things, inefficient production. Imports of dairy products were valued at $275&#13;
             million in 2006. The project is expected to address these shortcomings, as well as the shortage of industrially pro-&#13;
             cessed milk in Nigeria.&#13;
&#13;
             The project is also expected to generate jobs for the local population, including technical, semi-skilled and unskilled&#13;
             positions, at wages that are more attractive than average local wages. Staff will benefit from targeted training&#13;
             programs. Local businesses also stand to gain indirectly from the project through the provision of goods and&#13;
             services for the construction of the factory and warehouses.&#13;
&#13;
             The project meets several of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s strategic priorities as it supports a small investment into an IDA-eligible,&#13;
             conflict-affected country in Africa. The project is also consistent with the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s country partnership&#13;
             strategy for Nigeria, and it supports the government of Nigeriaâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to promote private sector-led growth, par-&#13;
             ticularly in the non-oil sector.&#13;

Rwanda       Project Name: Cogebanque&#13;
             Guarantee Holders: ShoreCap International Ltd.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGA issued a guarantee of $1.8 million to ShoreCap International (SCI) of the Cayman Islands covering its equity&#13;
             investment in Companie GÃ©nÃ©rale de Banque in Rwanda (CogÃ©banque). The coverage is for a period of up to six&#13;
             years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
             The project consists of an investment by SCI and two foreign sponsors to help CogÃ©banque improve its services&#13;
             and to satisfy the recent increase in the minimum capital requirement to RWF 5 billion (approximately $9.2&#13;
             million) mandated by the Rwandan Central Bank. CogÃ©banque was established in 1999 and has experienced steady&#13;
             growth for the past five years. The bank offers deposit mobilization products and credit facilities to corporations,&#13;
             SMEs, retail clients, and individuals. SCI will provide technical assistance to Cogebanque in the following areas:&#13;
             strengthening credit services for SME; developing internal audit and controls; developing its human resources&#13;
             department; and ongoing training and coaching in key areas.&#13;
&#13;
             Fostering broad-based growth in rural economic activity and in the private sector, including SMEs, is an important&#13;
             element of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s continuing economic recovery. The investor is committed to providing quality financial&#13;
             services to SMEs, which, despite existing efforts within the financial system are finding it difficult to access bank&#13;
             loans. In addition to its core loan products, deposit services will play an important part in the bankâ&#128;&#153;s overall&#13;
             outreach. Of all the fully licensed commercial banks, it has the widest branch network and widest customer base&#13;
             among the rural population.&#13;
&#13;
             MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s participation in the project is aligned with the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s priority of supporting investments in sub-Saharan&#13;
             Africa and into IDA-eligible nations. The project was underwritten through MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Small Investment Program.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                 Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Established in 1988, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is a member of the World Bank Group. The Bank Group also includes&#13;
                 the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance&#13;
                 Corporation (IFC), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). MIGA is a legal entity separate and distinct from IBRD,&#13;
                 IDA, IFC, and ICSID, with its own charter (the â&#128;&#156;Conventionâ&#128;&#157;), share capital, financial structure, management, and staff. Membership in the agency,&#13;
                 which currently stands at 172, is open to all members of IBRD.&#13;
                 	     MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s mission is to promote foreign direct investment (FDI) into developing countries to support economic growth, reduce poverty, and&#13;
                 improve peopleâ&#128;&#153;s lives. To this end, the agency acts as a multilateral risk mitigator, providing investors and lenders in the international investment&#13;
                 community with the level of comfort necessary to invest in developing countries. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s core business is the provision of political risk insurance. In&#13;
                 addition, as part of its mandate, the agency carries out complementary activities such as providing dispute resolution, technical assistance, and online&#13;
                 information services to support FDI.&#13;
                 	     MIGA is committed to promoting projects that are economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable, and promise a strong development&#13;
                 impact. By providing political risk insurance for foreign direct investment in developing countries, MIGA is able to play a critical role in supporting the&#13;
                 World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s broad strategic priorities.&#13;
                 	Since inception, MIGA has issued $20 billion of guarantees (including amounts issued under the Cooperative Underwriting Program), in support&#13;
                 of 580 projects in approximately 100 member countries. The agency has also conducted hundreds of technical assistance activities, as well as multiple&#13;
                 programs at regional and global levels in member countries.&#13;
                 	     MIGA is financially self-sustaining, and its activities are supported by a robust capital base and a comprehensive risk management framework.&#13;
                 The agency prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP)&#13;
                 and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).&#13;

                 Summary of Business Segments&#13;
&#13;
                 MIGA seeks to fulfill its mission in developing member countries by offering political risk insurance, investment dispute resolution, technical assistance,&#13;
                 and online dissemination of information.&#13;
&#13;
                 Political Risk Insurance (PRI)&#13;
                 MIGA provides investment guarantees against certain noncommercial risks (i.e., political risk insurance) to eligible foreign investors for qualified&#13;
                 investments in developing member countries. Coverage is offered against the risks of 1) transfer restriction and inconvertibility, 2) expropriation, 3)&#13;
                 breach of contract, and 4) war and civil disturbance, and investors may choose any combination of these covers1 (see Box 1). MIGA insures new cross-&#13;
                 border investments originating in any MIGA member country, destined for any developing member country. Types of investments that can be covered&#13;
                 include equity, shareholder and non-shareholder loans, and loan guarantees, provided the loans have a minimum maturity of three years. Other forms&#13;
                 of investmentsâ&#128;&#148;such as technical assistance and management contracts, or franchising and licensing agreementsâ&#128;&#148;may also be eligible. Table 1&#13;
                 contains a summary of cumulative guarantees issued in member countries.&#13;
             1&#13;
                  	 Guarantees underwritten through the Small Investment Program (SIP) require coverage for transfer restriction, expropriation and war&#13;
             	      and civil disturbance.&#13;

During FY08, MIGA supported 15 projects in IDA-eligible countries and nine projects in sub-Saharan Africa, which are areas of special focus for the&#13;
agency. In terms of exposure, IDA-eligible countries accounted for 41 percent of the net portfolio as of June 30, 2008, while coverage for projects in&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 22 percent.&#13;
	Table 2 details the regional distribution of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s gross and net guarantee exposures over the past three years. The total gross and net&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
MIGA is able to provide investors with a higher level of investment insurance coverage through the use of reinsurance arrangements with public and&#13;
private insurers. MIGA cedes exposure to its reinsurance partners, thereby enhancing its capacity and allowing it to better manage its risk profile,&#13;
project and country exposure levels. Whereas MIGA assumes the credit risk for its reinsurance partners under facultative reinsurance arrangements,&#13;
this risk is borne by the investor under the Cooperative Underwriting Program (CUP). MIGA may also act as a reinsurer, assuming investment portfolio&#13;
exposure from both public (e.g. export credit agencies) and private insurers â&#128;&#147; thereby freeing up their capacity and allowing them to offer additional&#13;
support to their policyholders.&#13;
&#13;
Technical Assistance (TA)&#13;
In FY07 MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s technical assistance (TA) program was integrated with that of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) to&#13;
achieve operational synergies. The agency continues to provide budgetary support for the TA program and guidance on its work program. However,&#13;
daily operations are being managed by FIAS.&#13;
&#13;
Online Dissemination of Investment-related Information&#13;
MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s online information services include FDInet (www.fdi.net) and PRI-Center (www.pri-center.com). These help the agency fulfill its mandate of&#13;
conducting research and extending knowledge with regard to FDI and political risk-related issues.&#13;

&amp;#12;         Investment Dispute Resolution&#13;
         Article 23 of the MIGA Convention mandates the agency to seek to remove impediments to the flow of investment to developing member countries,&#13;
         and encourage the settlement of disputes between investors and host governments. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s dispute resolution efforts relate to projects where MIGA&#13;
         has issued guarantees. In addition, the agency has selectively offered mediation services to help resolve disputes between investors not guaranteed&#13;
         by MIGA and host countries which inhibit the flow of additional investment to the host country. MIGA may seek compensation for such services, in&#13;
         addition to reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses for the costs of the mediation.&#13;

&#13;
         Outlook and Challenges&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Market Trends&#13;
         One of the principal changes in the market environment over the three year period leading up to 2007 was the fall in risk perceptions, reflected in the&#13;
         narrowing of the Emerging Market Bond Index global composite stripped spreads, and the higher rate of growth of FDI into developing countries.&#13;
         During this period, the PRI market expanded significantly with the entry of new private sector players and the growth of operations of existing players.&#13;
         Combined with lower perceived political risks, the industry saw significant downward pressure on premium rates.&#13;
         	     However, over the past year there has been a shift. The disturbance in the financial markets stemming from the tightening of liquidity has had&#13;
         an effect not only on the availability of credit but also on the capacity of the PRI industry to underwrite coverage. At the same time, however, there has&#13;
         been a general increase in perceptions of global risk. Thus, the environment is one of countervailing forces: while there is on the one hand less credit to&#13;
         finance deals and a tightening within the PRI market, there is also a greater general perception of risk which means sponsors proceeding with project&#13;
         will have a greater desire to identify effective risk mitigants.&#13;
&#13;
         Operational Priorities&#13;
         In 2008, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Board of Directors endorsed an updated Operational Directions paper identifying areas of special strategic focus for the FY09-11&#13;
         period. Given the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s relative portfolio and development success overall, these are based on a continuation of the four main pillars in the FY05-08&#13;
         strategy, coupled with three guiding principles that will guide its delivery. The four main operational priorities are:&#13;
&#13;
         rr    Investments in IDA countries, a key area of comparative advantage for MIGA.&#13;
         rr    Investments in post-conflict countries, an area of strengthened engagement for the agency over the past few years and where MIGA remains&#13;
               strongly relevant.&#13;
         rr    Investment in complex projects, mostly in infrastructure and the extractive industries, often involving government intervention and resulting in a&#13;
               delicate balance of risk-sharing by stakeholders.&#13;
         rr    Support for investments between MIGA Category Two countries2 (South-South investments), given the growing proportion of FDI coming from&#13;
               developing countries and the need to provide underserved corporations with political risk insurance.&#13;
&#13;
         MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s delivery of these operational priorities will be guided by the need to be:&#13;
         rr Supportive of and complement World Bank Group strategies articulated for specific countries, as well as its strategic themes.&#13;
         rr Client and market responsiveness through greater flexibility in service and product delivery across all markets.&#13;
         rr Financial sustainability which will require an efficient use of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s capital and the maintenance of a balanced portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Funding Sources&#13;
&#13;
         Subscribed Capital&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA derives its financial strength primarily from the capital it receives from its shareholders and its retained earnings. In FY08, New Zealand com-&#13;
         pleted its membership requirements, bringing the total number of member countries to 172.&#13;
         	     MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Convention established MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s authorized capital stock (membership shares) at 100,000 sharesâ&#128;&#148;equivalent to $1,082 millionâ&#128;&#148;with&#13;
         a provision that the authorized capital stock shall automatically increase upon the admission of a new member to the extent that the total number of&#13;
         authorized shares are sufficient to allow subscription by the new member. As of June 30, 2008, the authorized shares increased to 105,845, equivalent&#13;
         to $1,145.2 million, subscribed by 172 member countries. Of the membership shares subscribed, 20 percent or $229.0 million had been paid-in and&#13;
         the remaining 80 percent or $916.2 million was subject to call when needed by MIGA to meet its obligations. At June 30, 2008, $113.2 million is in the&#13;
         form of nonnegotiable, non-interest bearing demand obligations (promissory notes). The notes are denominated in freely convertible currencies and&#13;
         are due on demand to meet MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s obligations. Since inception, MIGA has not encashed any of the promissory notes.&#13;
         	On March 29, 1999, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Council of Governors approved a General Capital Increase (GCI) of 78,559 shares, equivalent to $850 million. The&#13;
         subscription period ended on March 28, 2003. On March 17, 2003, the Council of Governors approved an amendment to the GCI resolution allowing&#13;
         eligible countries to reserve the GCI shares allocated to them by submitting an instrument of contribution before the end of the GCI subscription&#13;
         period, and requesting such countries to subscribe to their GCI shares as soon as possible. The reserved shares are issued and corresponding voting&#13;
         power accrues when the subscription process reaches completion, i.e. when the requisite payment has been received. No time limit has been set for&#13;
         the payment of the reserved shares. As of June 30, 2008, cumulative subscriptions to the GCI totaled 68,934 shares, equivalent to $745.8 million, and&#13;
         GCI shares reserved through instruments of contribution totaled 7,328 shares, equivalent to $79.3 million. Of the GCI shares subscribed, $131.6 million&#13;
         has been paid-in and $614.2 million is callable.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
As of June 30, 2008, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s total subscribed capital amounted to $1,891 million, of which $361 million was paid-in and $1,530 million was callable.&#13;
Since its inception, no call has been made on MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s callable capital. Any calls on unpaid subscriptions are uniform on all shares. If the amount&#13;
received by MIGA on a call is insufficient to meet the obligations which necessitated the call, MIGA may make further calls until the amounts received&#13;
are sufficient to meet such obligations. The liability of a member on a call or calls is limited to the unpaid balance of its capital subscription.&#13;
&#13;
Equity&#13;
Total shareholdersâ&#128;&#153; equity as reported in MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s balance sheet as of June 30, 2008 was $891 million compared with $831 million as of June 30, 2007.&#13;
This amount consists of subscribed capital, less uncalled portions of subscriptions, plus retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive&#13;
income. The increase of $60 million in FY08 primarily reflects the increase in retained earnings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
Underwriting Capacity&#13;
&#13;
MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s equity base ensures the financial sustainability of the agency, over both the short-term and longer-term. The subscribed capital and retained&#13;
earnings determine the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s statutory underwriting capacity. The Council of Governors and the Board of Directors have set the maximum amount&#13;
of contingent liability that may be assumed by MIGA as 350 percent of the sum of its unimpaired subscribed capital and reserves and retained earnings,&#13;
90 percent of reinsurance obtained by MIGA with private insurers, and 100 percent of reinsurance obtained with public insurers. In other words, the&#13;
maximum amount of net guarantee exposure is determined by the amount of available capital, and is expressed on a gross exposure basis by adding the&#13;
current amount of portfolio reinsurance. As of June 30, 2008, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s underwriting capacity was $11,593 million, as follows:&#13;

&amp;#12;         Capital Adequacy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Following the adoption of its formal Economic Capital-based capital adequacy framework in FY07, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s measures of capital adequacy and risk-&#13;
         bearing capacity include economic capital consumed by the guarantee portfolio. Modeled economic capital (EC) is the portion of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s capital that is&#13;
         placed at risk by the guarantee portfolio exposure. It provides an analytically rigorous measure for assessing the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s consumption of risk capital,&#13;
         and incorporates the effects from portfolio diversification and concentration. As of June 30, 2008, the economic capital consumed by the guarantee&#13;
         portfolio amounted to $250 million, compared to $229 million as of June 30, 2007.&#13;
         	Through an annual exercise of gauging the capital adequacy position, the current amount of EC consumed by MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s activities is calculated to&#13;
         provide a measure of how much of available operating capital is currently utilized. In addition, as part of the framework, MIGA assesses how much&#13;
         EC is projected to be utilized in the future under various scenarios of growth of the guarantee portfolio. These are stressed scenarios, estimating over&#13;
         five years the EC consumed under assumptions of continued growth to MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s portfolio, in combination with country rating downgrades and regional&#13;
         contagion effects.&#13;
         	Throughout the year, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s management monitors the level and utilization of available operating capital. This includes paid-in-capital, retained&#13;
         earnings, and the insurance portfolio reserve, net of the corresponding reinsurance recoverable. MIGA managementâ&#128;&#153;s objective is to have sufficient&#13;
         operating capital to sustain losses associated with claims and to support the ongoing business without facing a significant risk of having to avail of the&#13;
         callable capital. As a measure of the current utilization of this capital by the guarantee portfolio, Table 5 shows the ratio of EC / operating capital over&#13;
         the past two years. This ratio has increased slightly to 24.6 percent in FY08 compared with 24.1 percent in FY07. Table 5 also shows the ratio of EC /&#13;
         Portfolio net exposure, to gauge year-on-year changes to the relative risk-level of the portfolio. As of end-FY08, this ratio stood at 7.0% compared to&#13;
         7.1% at end-FY07, reflecting a risk level of the guarantee portfolio that has remained largely unchanged, taking into account the increased size of the&#13;
         portfolio. Together, the two ratios indicate a strong and stable capital position at the end of FY08.&#13;

         INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s investment policy sets the objectives and constraints that must be considered in managing MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s investment strategy (long-term) and tactics&#13;
         (short-term) in light of its contingent liabilities, which are the investment guarantees it issues. Given the nature of these contingent liabilities, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
         invested assets may need to be liquidated to pay claims on a pre-recovery basis. As such, a certain portion of the assets is held in highly liquid assets&#13;
         with the amount determined by MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Economic Capital Model. The amount is equal to the capital loss expected to occur with 1 percent probability&#13;
         within one year, plus the amount of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s specific reserve on a gross pre-recovery basis.&#13;
         	     At present MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s investment portfolio is managed in two tranches subject to the constraints in the Investment Authorization approved by the&#13;
         Board in June 2004. Tranche 1 is managed with a risk tolerance of 1 percent probability of annual capital loss over a one-year horizon, reflecting the main&#13;
         objective of this tranche to provide for near-term liquidity needs described above. Tranche 2 is managed with a 1 percent probability of annual capital&#13;
         loss over a three-year horizon, reflecting the objective of providing more long-term capital growth. Portfolio management activities, including trading,&#13;
         risk analytics and reporting, are executed by IBRDâ&#128;&#153;s Treasury Department under an Investment Management Agreement and the associated Investment&#13;
         Management Guidelines between MIGA and IBRD.&#13;
         	     MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s investment portfolio consists mainly of USD denominated assets. The composition of the portfolio is shown in Figure 1. During FY08,&#13;
         the investment portfolio held cash, treasury securities, agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and derivatives. Also, the&#13;
         portfolio included cash and government securities denominated in other currencies. The portfolio yield was 5.3 percent in FY08 vs. 5.4 percent in FY07&#13;
         and the market value of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s asset portfolio was $915 million as of June 30, 2008, of which $760 resided in USD investments.&#13;

&#13;
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY&#13;
&#13;
The footnotes to MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s financial statements contain a detailed summary of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s significant accounting policies. Described below are those&#13;
significant policies where MIGA management is required to make estimates and parameters when preparing the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s financial statements and&#13;
accompanying notes to conform to both IFRS and US GAAP. Accounting estimates generally involve the development of parameters by management&#13;
based on judgments about the outcome of future conditions, transactions, or events. Because the outcome of future events is not known, actual results&#13;
could differ from those estimates in a variety of areas. The area which management views as most critical with respect to the application of estimates&#13;
and assumptions is the establishment of its loss reserves.&#13;
&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
&#13;
MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s provisioning methodology builds on portfolio risk quantification models which use both individually assessed loss probabilities for projects at&#13;
risk and rating-based loss probabilities that are applied to the entire guarantee portfolio. Under this methodology, for the purpose of presentation in&#13;
the financial statements, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s reserve consists of two primary components, the Specific Reserve and the Insurance Portfolio Reserve.3 These com-&#13;
ponents are defined based on the degree of probability and the basis of estimation.&#13;
	     Reserves are shown on a gross basis on the liability side of the balance sheet, and reinsurance assets on the asset side. A detailed summary of&#13;
MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s provisioning policy can be found in the Notes to Financial Statements â&#128;&#147; Note A.&#13;
&#13;
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits&#13;
	&#13;
Along with IBRD and IFC, MIGA participates in a number of pension and postretirement benefit plans that cover almost all of their staff members. All&#13;
costs, assets, and liabilities associated with these plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC, and MIGA based upon their employeesâ&#128;&#153; respective partici-&#13;
pation in the plans. The underlying actuarial assumptions, fair value of plan assets, and funded status associated with these plans are based on financial&#13;
market interest rates, past experience, and managementâ&#128;&#153;s best estimate of future benefit changes and economic conditions. For further details, please&#13;

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#13;
&#13;
Operating Income and Net Income&#13;
&#13;
FY08 operating income was $55.0 million, an increase of $6.0 million versus FY07 primarily due to improved net premium income and investment&#13;
income. And FY08 net income of $65.7 million increased by $3.4 million. Table 6 below shows the breakdown of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s operating income and net&#13;
income.&#13;

     FY08 versus FY07&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA issued $2.1 billion in guarantees during FY08, $730 million higher than in FY07. Higher new business volumes coupled with a decline in cancel-&#13;
     lations, saw gross exposure and premium income increase by $1.2 billion and $5.4 million respectively. Premium amounts ceded to reinsurers also&#13;
     increased by $3.8 million in FY08 as a result of increased volumes. Fees and commissions increased in FY08 in line with the increase in premium&#13;
     income.&#13;
     	     During FY08, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s investment portfolio generated $45.3 million of investment income, compared with $42.8 million in FY07. The yield was 5.3&#13;
     percent in FY08, compared with 5.4 percent in FY07.&#13;
     	     In FY08, administrative and other expenses decreased marginally to $29.2 million, compared with $30.1 million in FY07. Net income in FY08 was&#13;
     $65.7 million compared with $62.3 million in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     FY07 versus FY06&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA issued $1.37 billion in guarantees during FY07, $66 million higher than in FY06. However, the premium income decreased by $3.9 million as did&#13;
     the gross exposure by $61 million. In FY07, the trend of lower premium income due to expiries and cancellations of aged contracts that were written at&#13;
     higher premium rates in prior years continued. This in turn affected the premium amount ceded to reinsurers, which decreased by $3.2 million in FY07.&#13;
     Fees and commissions, a function of premium income also decreased during FY07.&#13;
     	     During FY07, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s investment portfolio generated $42.8 million of investment income, compared with $11.4 million in FY06. The yield was&#13;
     5.4 percent in FY07, compared with 1.5 percent in FY06. This increase in investment return was primarily due to a more favorable interest rate envi-&#13;
     ronment.&#13;
     	     In FY07, administrative and other expenses decreased marginally to $30.1 million, compared with $31.3 million in FY06. 	Net income in FY07 was&#13;
     $62.3 million compared with $23.2 million in FY06.&#13;

66   |    MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 08 MANAGEMENTâ&#128;&#153;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS&#13;
&amp;#12;CORPORATE GOVERNANCE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
General Governance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Board Membership&#13;
In accordance with MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Convention, members of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Board of Directors are appointed or elected by their member governments. Directors are&#13;
neither officers, nor staff of MIGA. The President is the only management member of the Board of Directors, serving as a non-voting member (except&#13;
casting a deciding vote in case of an equal division) and as Chairman of the Board. The Directors have established several committees including:&#13;
rr Committee on Development Effectiveness&#13;
rr Audit Committee&#13;
rr Budget Committee&#13;
rr Personnel Committee&#13;
rr Ethics Committee&#13;
rr Committee on Governance and Administrative Matters&#13;
&#13;
The Directors and their committees function in continuous session at the principal offices of MIGA, as business requires. Each committeeâ&#128;&#153;s terms&#13;
of reference establishes its respective roles and responsibilities. As committees do not vote on issues, their role is primarily to serve the full Board of&#13;
Directors in discharging its responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Audit Committee&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Membership&#13;
The Audit Committee consists of eight members of the Board of Directors. Membership on the Committee is determined by the Board of Directors,&#13;
based upon nominations by the Chairman of the Board, following informal consultation with the Directors. In addition, membership of the Committee&#13;
is expected to reflect the economic and geographic diversity of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s member countries. Other relevant selection criteria include seniority, continuity,&#13;
and relevant experience. Some or all of the responsibilities of individual Committee members are performed by their alternates or advisors. Generally,&#13;
Committee members are appointed for a two-year term; reappointment to a second term, when possible, is desirable for continuity. Audit Committee&#13;
meetings are generally open to any member of the Board who may wish to attend, and non-Committee members of the Board may participate in the&#13;
discussion. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee may speak in that capacity at meetings of the Board of Directors, with respect to discus-&#13;
sions held in the Audit Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Key Responsibilities&#13;
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board to assist it in the oversight and assessment of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s finances and accounting, including the ef-&#13;
fectiveness of financial policies, the integrity of financial statements, the system of internal controls regarding finance, accounting and ethics (including&#13;
fraud and corruption), and financial and operational risks. The Audit Committee also has the responsibility for reviewing the performance and recom-&#13;
mending to the Board the appointment of the external auditor, as well as monitoring the independence of the external auditor and meeting with it in&#13;
executive session. The Audit Committee participates in oversight of the internal audit function, including reviewing the responsibilities, staffing and&#13;
effectiveness of internal audit. The committee likewise reviews the annual internal audit plan. In the execution of its role, the committee discusses with&#13;
management as well as the external and internal auditors financial issues and policies which have an impact on the institutionâ&#128;&#153;s financial position and&#13;
risk-bearing capacity. The Audit Committee monitors the evolution of developments in corporate governance and the role of audit committees on an&#13;
ongoing basis and revised its terms of reference in FY04 to reflect this responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
Communications&#13;
The Audit Committee communicates regularly with the full Board through distribution of the following:&#13;
rr The minutes of its meetings.&#13;
rr Reports of the Audit Committee prepared by the Chairman, which document discussions held. These reports are distributed to the Directors,&#13;
     Alternates, World Bank Group Senior Management, and the Senior Management of MIGA.&#13;
rr â&#128;&#156;Statement(s) of the Chairmanâ&#128;&#157; and statements issued by other members of the committee.&#13;
rr The Annual Report to the Board of Directors, which provides an overview of the main issues addressed by the committee over the year.&#13;
&#13;
The Audit Committeeâ&#128;&#153;s communications with the external auditor are described in the Auditor Independence section.&#13;
&#13;
Executive Sessions&#13;
Members of the Audit Committee may convene in executive session at any time, without management present. Under the Audit Committeeâ&#128;&#153;s terms of&#13;
reference, it meets separately in executive session with the external and internal auditors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                               MANAGEMENTâ&#128;&#153;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 08                                       |   67&#13;
&amp;#12;     Access to Resources and to Management&#13;
     Throughout the year, the Audit Committee receives a large volume of information, which supports the preparation of the financial statements. The&#13;
     Audit Committee meets both formally and informally throughout the year to discuss financial and accounting matters. Directors have complete access&#13;
     to management. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management the quarterly and annual financial statements. The committee also&#13;
     reviews with the external auditor the financial statements prior to their publication and recommends them for approval to the Board of Directors.&#13;
     	The Audit Committee has the capacity, under exceptional circumstances, to obtain advice and assistance from outside legal, accounting, or other&#13;
     advisors as deemed appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Code of Ethics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA strives to foster and maintain a positive work environment that supports the ethical behavior of its staff. To facilitate this effort, the World Bank&#13;
     Group has in place a Code of Professional Ethicsâ&#128;&#148;Living our Values. MIGA has adopted the code, which applies to all staff (including managers, con-&#13;
     sultants, and temporary employees) worldwide.&#13;
     	This code is available in nine languages on IBRDâ&#128;&#153;s website, www.worldbank.org. Staff relations, conflicts of interest, and operational issues,&#13;
     including the accuracy of books and records, are key elements of the code.&#13;
     	     In addition to the code, an essential element of appropriate conduct is compliance with the obligations embodied in the Principles of Staff&#13;
     Employment, Staff Rules, and Administrative Rules, the violation of which may result in disciplinary actions. In accordance with the Staff Rules, senior&#13;
     managers must complete a confidential financial disclosure instrument with the Office of Ethics and Business Conduct.&#13;
     	     Guidance for staff is also provided through programs, training materials, and other resources. Managers are responsible for ensuring that internal&#13;
     systems, policies, and procedures are consistently aligned with MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s ethical goals. In support of its efforts on ethics, MIGA offers a variety of methods&#13;
     for informing staff of these resources. Many of these efforts are headed by the following groups:&#13;
&#13;
     rr    The Office of Ethics and Business Conduct (OEBC) provides leadership, management and oversight for MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s ethics infrastructure including&#13;
           the Ethics HelpLine, a consolidated conflicts of interest disclosure/resolution system, financial disclosure, ongoing training to both internal and&#13;
           external audiences, and communication resources.&#13;
     rr    The Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) is charged with investigating allegations of fraud and corruption in projects benefiting from&#13;
           World Bank Group funding or guarantees worldwide. The Department also investigates allegations of misconduct by MIGA staff and trains and&#13;
           educates staff and clients in detecting and reporting fraud and corruption in MIGA-guaranteed projects. The Department reports directly to the&#13;
           President and is composed of professionals from a range of disciplines including financial analysts, researchers, investigators, lawyers, prosecu-&#13;
           tors, forensic accountants, and staff with operational experience across the World Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA has in place procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received regarding accounting, internal control and auditing mat-&#13;
     ters, including close collaboration with OEBC and INT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Auditor Independence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In February 2003, the Board of Directors adopted a set of principles applicable to the appointment of the external auditor for the World Bank Group.&#13;
     Key features of those principles include:&#13;
&#13;
     rr    Prohibition of the external auditor from the provision of all non audit-related services&#13;
     rr    All audit-related services must be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee&#13;
     rr    Mandatory rebidding of the external audit contract every five years&#13;
     rr    Prohibition of any firm serving as external auditors for more than two consecutive five-year terms&#13;
     rr    Mandatory rotation of the senior partner after five years&#13;
     rr    An evaluation of the performance of the external auditor at the mid-point of the five year term&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     External auditors are appointed to a five-year term of service. This is subject to annual reappointment based on the recommendation of the Audit&#13;
     Committee and approval of a resolution by the Executive Directors. Following a mandatory re-bidding of the external audit contract during FY 2008,&#13;
     IBRDâ&#128;&#153;s Executive Directors approved the appointment of KPMG as IBRDâ&#128;&#153;s auditors for a five-year term commencing FY 2009.&#13;
     	    As standard practice, the external auditor is present as an observer at virtually all Audit Committee meetings and is frequently asked to present its&#13;
     perspective on issues. In addition, the Audit Committee meets periodically with the external auditor in private session without management present.&#13;
     Communication between the external auditor and the Audit Committee is ongoing, as frequently as is deemed necessary by either party. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     auditors follow the communication requirements with audit committees set out under US Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and International&#13;
     Standards on Auditing. In keeping with these standards, significant formal communications include:&#13;

         Purpose&#13;
&#13;
         The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988, is a member of the World Bank Group which also includes the&#13;
         International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the International Development&#13;
         Association (IDA). MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall development objectives of the other World Bank insti-&#13;
         tutions. MIGA is designed to help developing countries attract productive foreign investment by both private investors and commercially operated&#13;
         public sector companies. Its facilities include guarantees or insurance against noncommercial risks and a program of advisory services and technical&#13;
         assistance to support member countriesâ&#128;&#153; efforts to attract and retain foreign direct investment.&#13;

          Note Aâ&#128;&#148;Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Basis of Preparation&#13;
&#13;
         MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and with accounting principles&#13;
         generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The policy adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circumstances of&#13;
         MIGA having regard to its legal requirements and to the practices of other international insurance entities. On August 7, 2008, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s board of direc-&#13;
         tors approved the financial statements for issue.&#13;
&#13;
         Accounting &amp; Reporting Developments&#13;
&#13;
         The International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) issued International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 4 â&#128;&#156;Insurance Contractsâ&#128;&#157; in March 2004&#13;
         to achieve convergence of widely varying insurance industry accounting practices around the world. IASB has divided the insurance project into two&#13;
         phases. In line with the requirements of Phase 1, MIGA included additional disclosures beginning the quarter ended September 30, 2005 that identify&#13;
         and explain the amounts in the financial statements arising from insurance contracts. Phase 2 of the project is expected to come into effect in 2011.&#13;
         This will address issues relating to insurance accounting.&#13;
         	The IASB issued a new standard (IFRS 7) â&#128;&#156;Financial Instruments: Disclosuresâ&#128;&#157; and revised standard (IAS 1) â&#128;&#156;Presentation of Financial Statementsâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
         that are to be applied for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2007. MIGA has implemented these standards as of July 1, 2007.&#13;
         	      In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, â&#128;&#156;Fair&#13;
         Value Measurements.â&#128;&#157; This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after November 15, 2007. MIGA is assessing the impact of this&#13;
         standard on its financial statements.&#13;
         	      In February 2007, the FASB issued the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 159, â&#128;&#156;The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and&#13;
         Financial Liabilities.â&#128;&#157; This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after November 15, 2007 and will not impact MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s financial&#13;
         statements.&#13;
         	      In December 2007, the FASB issued the Statement of Financial Reporting Standard No. 160, â&#128;&#156;Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial&#13;
         Statements â&#128;&#147; an amendment of ARB No. 51â&#128;&#157; (FAS 160), which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. This statement is effective&#13;
         for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. FAS 160 will not impact MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s financial statements.&#13;
         	      In March 2008, the FASB issued the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.161, â&#128;&#156;Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging&#13;
         Activitiesâ&#128;&#157; (FAS 161). FAS 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced&#13;
         disclosures to better understand their effects on an entityâ&#128;&#153;s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The provisions of FAS 161 are&#13;
         effective for Financial Statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. MIGA is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions&#13;
         of FAS 161.&#13;
         	      In May 2008, the FASB issued the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 163 â&#128;&#156;Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts,&#13;
         an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60.â&#128;&#157; For certain financial insurance guarantee contracts, this statement addresses premium revenue recog-&#13;
         nition, claim liability recognition and disclosures related to each. Except for certain disclosures that are applicable for quarter ending September 30,&#13;
         2008 onwards, this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. MIGA is currently assessing the impact of this standard&#13;
         on its financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
         Differences between US GAAP and IFRS&#13;
&#13;
         On September 29, 2006, the FASB issued the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 158, Employersâ&#128;&#153; Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension&#13;
         and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158). FAS 158 requires employers to recognize on their balance sheets the funded status of their defined benefit&#13;
         postretirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. Gains or losses and prior&#13;
         service costs or credits that arise during the period are recognized as part of Other Comprehensive Income, to the extent they are not recognized as&#13;
         components of the net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, upon adoption, FAS 158 requires unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss and unrecognized&#13;
         prior service costs to be recognized in the ending balance of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. These amounts will be adjusted as they are&#13;
         subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, based upon the current amortization and recognition requirements of Statement&#13;
         of Financial Accounting Standard No. 87, Employersâ&#128;&#153; Accounting for Pensions (FAS 87) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,&#13;
         Employersâ&#128;&#153; Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (FAS 106). FAS 158 is applicable to MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s financial statements as of June 30,&#13;
         2007 and the impact of its adoption is discussed further in Note F.&#13;
         	     MIGA has changed its accounting policy under International Accounting Standards (IAS) 19, Employee Benefits to recognize all actuarial gains&#13;
         and losses in the period in which they occurâ&#128;&#148;but outside profit or lossâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;in a statement of changes in shareholderâ&#128;&#153;s equity.â&#128;&#157; This is a permitted alter-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
82   |    MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 08 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&amp;#12;native available under IAS 19 and MIGA considers that this will allow it to show the over/under funded position on the balance sheet thereby making its&#13;
financial statements more relevant and complete. SFAS 158 requires prospective application of the standard, while the change in approach under IAS&#13;
19 requires retrospective application. In addition, SFAS 158 and IAS 19 differ in the treatment of amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains or losses.&#13;
SFAS 158 requires the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses to be amortized to the Income Statement, and IAS 19 requires the unrecognized&#13;
actuarial gains or losses to remain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. As a result, Net Income is lower by $36,000 and $187,000 for FY08&#13;
and FY07 respectively as reported under US GAAP compared to IFRS. MIGA does not believe these differences are material.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates&#13;
&#13;
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards and accounting principles generally accepted in&#13;
the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.&#13;
Actual results could differ from these estimates.&#13;
	Significant judgments have been made in areas which management views as most critical with respect to the establishment of its loss reserves,&#13;
the determination of net periodic income from pension and other post retirement benefits plans, and the present value of benefit obligations.&#13;
	The significant accounting policies employed by MIGA are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Investments&#13;
MIGA manages its investment portfolio both for the purpose of providing liquidity for potential claims and for capital growth. MIGA invests in&#13;
time deposits, Mortgage/Asset-Backed Securities and government and agency obligations based on its investment policy approved by the Board.&#13;
Government and agency obligations include highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills and other obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by&#13;
governments of countries or other official entities including government agencies or by multilateral organizations. MIGA also enters into exchange&#13;
traded futures and options transactions to manage its investment portfolio. The purposes of these transactions are to enhance the return and manage&#13;
the overall duration of the portfolio. With respect to futures and options, MIGA generally closes out most open positions prior to expiration. Futures&#13;
are settled on a daily basis.&#13;
	     MIGA has classified all investment securities as trading. Investments classified as trading securities are reported at fair value using trade-date&#13;
accounting. Securities purchased or sold may have a settlement date that is different from the trade-date. Securities purchased that could not be settled&#13;
before the reporting dates are recorded as liability. Similarly, securities sold that could not be settled before the reporting dates are recorded under&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Other Assets.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
	     For trading securities, unrealized net gains and losses are both recognized in earnings. Net gains and losses include interest income under the&#13;
caption â&#128;&#156;Income from investments.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Nonnegotiable, Noninterest-bearing Demand Obligations on Account of Subscribed Capital&#13;
Payments on these instruments are due to MIGA upon demand and are held in bank accounts which bear MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s name. Accordingly, these instruments&#13;
are carried and reported at face value as assets on the balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Impairment of Reinsurance Assets&#13;
MIGA assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that the reinsurance asset is impaired, and makes a provision for such&#13;
impairment. Objective evidence may be in the form of observable data that comes to MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s attention periodically. If an impairment is determined, the&#13;
carrying amount of the reinsurance asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income&#13;
statement.&#13;
&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s reserve consists of two primary components, the Specific Reserve and the Insurance Portfolio Reserve. These components are comprehensive&#13;
and mutually exclusive with respect to risk of losses that may develop from each guarantee contract, and from the contingent liability for the portfolio&#13;
as a whole.&#13;
	The Specific Reserve is calculated based on contract-specific parameters that are reviewed every quarter by MIGA Management for contracts that&#13;
have known difficulties. The Insurance Portfolio Reserve is calculated based on the long-term historical experiences of the political risk industry.&#13;
	     Assumptions and parameters used in the calculations are intended to serve as the basis for an objective, reasonably conservative and arms-length&#13;
valuation of insurance liabilities with a specified level of prudence. Key assumptions, including frequency of claim, severity, and expected recovery&#13;
have been quantitatively derived from the political risk insurance industryâ&#128;&#153;s historical claims data. The principal sources of data used as inputs for the&#13;
assumptions include the Berne Union and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). The historical analysis of the data from those sources is&#13;
further augmented by an internal econometric scoring analysis in order to derive risk-differentiated parameters with term structure effects over time. The&#13;
historical and econometric analyses cover periods that are over 30 years, and the derived parameters are considered stable in the short term; however the&#13;
analyses are reviewed annually. Short-term risk changes are captured by changes in internal risk ratings for countries and contracts on a quarterly basis.&#13;
	     For the purpose of the presentation of the financial statements, insurance liabilities (or reserves) are presented on a gross basis and not net of&#13;
reinsurance. Therefore, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s reserve is shown on a gross basis on the liability side of the balance sheet, while establishing reinsurance assets on the&#13;
asset side.&#13;
&#13;
Currency Translation&#13;
Assets and liabilities are translated at market exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Income and expenses are translated at either the&#13;
market exchange rates in effect on the dates on which they are recognized or at an average of the market exchange rates in effect during each month.&#13;
Translation adjustments are reflected in the Income Statement.&#13;
&#13;
Valuation of Capital Stock&#13;
Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock of MIGA shall be settled on the basis of the average value&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                        FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 08                           |   83&#13;
&amp;#12;         of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) introduced by the International Monetary Fund, as valued in terms of United States dollars for the period January&#13;
         1, 1981 to June 30, 1985, such value being equal to $1.082 for one SDR.&#13;
&#13;
         Revenue Recognition&#13;
         Premium amounts received on direct insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts assumed can be annual, semi-annual or quarterly and are recorded&#13;
         as unearned premium. Premiums are recognized as earned on a pro rata basis over the contract period. A receivable for premium is recorded when&#13;
         the contract has been renewed and coverage amounts have been identified.&#13;
         	     MIGA cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business by obtaining treaty and facultative reinsurance to augment its underwriting capacity&#13;
         and to mitigate its risk by protecting portions of its insurance portfolio. Premiums ceded (net of commission) follow the same approach as for direct&#13;
         insurance contracts and are recognized as expenses on a pro rata basis over the contract period.&#13;
         	     Fee income for MIGA primarily consists of administrative fees, arrangement fees, annual fees, renewal fees, and commitment (offer) fees.&#13;

             Note Bâ&#128;&#148;Investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA classifies all investment securities as trading. Investments classified as trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses&#13;
         included in earnings. The unrealized gains included in the investment income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 is $394,200 (unrealized gains of&#13;
         $6,538,710 â&#128;&#147; June 30, 2007).&#13;

         June 30, 2007) of the portfolio.&#13;
         	The maximum credit exposure of investments closely approximate the fair values of the financial instruments.&#13;
         	    Asset backed securities (ABS) are diversified among credit cards, student loans, home equity loans and mortgage backed securities. Since these&#13;
         holdings are primarily investment grade, neither concentration risk nor credit risk represents a significant risk to MIGA.&#13;

by such member. At June 30, 2008, the initial authorized capital stock increased to 184,404 (183,891 â&#128;&#147; June 30, 2007) shares. The Convention further&#13;
states that 10 percent of the membersâ&#128;&#153; initial subscription be paid in cash, in freely convertible currencies, except that developing member countries&#13;
may pay up to a quarter of the 10 percent in their own currencies. An additional 10 percent of the initial subscription shall be paid in the form of non&#13;
negotiable, non interest bearing promissory notes. The notes are denominated in freely convertible currencies and are due on demand to meet MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
obligations. The remaining 80 percent is subject to call when required by MIGA to meet its obligations.&#13;
	On March 29, 1999, the Council of Governors approved a General Capital Increase (GCI) resolution increasing the authorized capital stock of&#13;
MIGA by 78,559 shares to be subscribed by members during the subscription period ending March 28, 2002. Of the additional capital, 17.65&#13;
percent is to be paid in cash, in freely usable currency. The remaining 82.35 percent is subject to call when required by MIGA to meet its obligations. On&#13;
May 6, 2002, the Council of Governors adopted a resolution to extend the GCI subscription period to March 28, 2003. On March 17,&#13;
2003, the Council of Governors approved an amendment to the GCI resolution allowing eligible countries to subscribe to the GCI shares allocated&#13;
to them by submitting an Instrument of Contribution before the GCI deadline of March 28, 2003, and requesting such countries to pay for their GCI&#13;
shares as soon as possible. The reserved shares will be issued and corresponding voting power will accrue when the subscription process has been&#13;
completed.&#13;
	      During the year ended June 30, 2008, 513 shares were subscribed by member countries. At June 30, 2008, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s authorized capital stock com-&#13;
prised 184,404 shares of which 174,779 (174,266 â&#128;&#147; June 30, 2007) shares had been subscribed. Each share has a par value of SDR10,000, valued at the&#13;
rate of $1.082 per SDR. Of the subscribed capital, $360,694,000 ($359,584,000â&#128;&#148;June 30, 2007) has been paid in; and the remaining $1,530,415,000&#13;
($1,525,974,000â&#128;&#148;June 30, 2007) is subject to call. At June 30, 2008, $113,203,000 is in the form of nonnegotiable, non interest bearing demand obli-&#13;
gations (promissory notes). A summary of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s capital stock at June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007 is as follows:&#13;

Guarantee Program&#13;
&#13;
MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss caused by non-commercial risks (political risk insurance) to eligible investors on qualified&#13;
investments in developing member countries. MIGA insures investments for up to 20 years against four different categories of risk: currency&#13;
inconvertibility and transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract. Currency inconvertibility and transfer&#13;
restriction coverage protects the investor against inconvertibility of local currency into foreign exchange for transfer outside the host country.&#13;
Currency depreciation is not covered. Expropriation coverage protects the investor against partial or total loss of the insured investment as a&#13;
result of acts by the host government that may reduce or eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured investment. War and civil&#13;
disturbance coverage protects the investor against losses from damage to, or the destruction or disappearance of, tangible coverage assets, as&#13;
well as a total loss due to business interruption extending for a period of at least 180 days, caused by politically motivated acts of war or civil&#13;
disturbance in the host country including revolution, insurrection, coup dâ&#128;&#153;etat, sabotage and terrorism. Breach of contract coverage protects the&#13;
investor against the inability to enforce an award arising out of an arbitral or judicial decision recognizing the breach of a covered obligation by&#13;
the host government. Investors may insure projects by purchasing any combination of the four coverages. MIGA guarantees cannot be terminated&#13;
unilaterally by the guarantee holder within the first three years from the date of issuance without payment of a termination fee except as provided&#13;
in the contract. MIGA cannot terminate the contract unless the guarantee holder defaults on its contractual obligations to MIGA.&#13;
	Premium rates applicable are set forth in the contracts. Payments against all claims under a guarantee may not exceed the maximum amount&#13;
of coverage issued under the guarantee. Under breach of contract coverage, payments against claims may not exceed the lesser of the amount of&#13;
guarantee and the arbitration award.&#13;
	     MIGA also acts as administrator of some investment guarantee trust funds. MIGA, on behalf of the trust funds, issues guarantees against&#13;
loss caused by non-commercial risks to eligible investors on qualified investments in the countries specified in the trust fund agreements. Under&#13;
the trust fund agreements, MIGA, as administrator of the trust funds, is not liable on its own account for payment of any claims under contracts&#13;
of guarantees issued by MIGA on behalf of such trust funds which at June 30, 2008 amounts to $3,517,000 ($2,942,000 â&#128;&#147; June 30, 2007).&#13;

&amp;#12;         Contingent Liability&#13;
&#13;
         The maximum amount of contingent liability of MIGA under guarantees issued and outstanding at June 30, 2008 totaled $6,475,136,000&#13;
         ($5,301,190,000â&#128;&#148;June 30, 2007). A contract of guarantee issued by MIGA may permit the guarantee holder, at the start of each contract period, to&#13;
         elect coverage and place amounts both on current and standby. MIGA is currently at risk for amounts placed on current. The maximum amount of con-&#13;
         tingent liability is MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s maximum exposure to insurance claims, which includes â&#128;&#156;standbyâ&#128;&#157; coverage for which MIGA is committed but not currently at&#13;
         risk. At June 30, 2008, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s actual exposure to insurance claims, exclusive of standby coverage is $5,159,055,000 ($3,379,228,000â&#128;&#148;June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Reinsurance&#13;
&#13;
         MIGA obtains treaty and facultative reinsurance (both public and private) to augment its underwriting capacity and to mitigate its risk by protecting&#13;
         portions of its insurance portfolio, and not for speculative reasons. All reinsurance contracts are ceded on a proportionate basis. However, MIGA is&#13;
         exposed to reinsurance non-performance risk in the event that reinsurers fail to pay their proportionate share of the loss in case of a claim. MIGA&#13;
         manages this risk by requiring that private sector reinsurers be rated by at least two of the four major rating agencies (Standard &amp; Poorâ&#128;&#153;s, A.M. Best,&#13;
         Moodyâ&#128;&#153;s and Fitch), and that such ratings be above a minimum threshold. In addition, MIGA may also place reinsurance with public insurers of&#13;
         member countries that operate under and benefit from the full faith and credit of their governments and with multilateral agencies that represent an&#13;
         acceptable counterparty risk. MIGA has established limits, at both the project and portfolio levels, which restrict the amount of reinsurance that may&#13;
         be ceded. The project limit states that MIGA may cede no more than 90 percent of any individual project. The portfolio limit states that MIGA may not&#13;
         reinsure more than 50 percent of its aggregate gross exposure.&#13;
         	Of the $6,475,136,000 outstanding contingent liability (gross exposure) as at June 30, 2008 ($5,301,190,000â&#128;&#148;June 30, 2007),&#13;
         $2,897,318,000 was ceded through contracts of reinsurance ($2,091,776,000â&#128;&#148;June 30, 2007). Net exposure amounted to $3,577,818,000 as at June&#13;
         30, 2008 ($3,209,414,000â&#128;&#148;June 30, 2007).&#13;
         	          As of June 30, 2008, total reinsurance provided by MIGA was nil ($28,933,000- June 30, 2007).&#13;

         Portfolio Risk Management&#13;
&#13;
         Controlled acceptance of political risk in developing countries is MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s core business. The underwriting of such risk requires a comprehensive risk&#13;
         management framework to analyze, measure, mitigate and control risk exposures.&#13;
         		     Claims risk, the largest risk for MIGA, is the risk of incurring a financial loss as a result of a claimable political risk event in developing countries.&#13;
         Political risk assessment forms an integral part of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s underwriting process and includes the analysis of both country-related and project-related&#13;
         risks.&#13;
         		     Country risk assessment is a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Ratings are assigned individually to each risk for which MIGA&#13;
         provides insurance coverage in a country. Country ratings are reviewed and updated every quarter. Country risk assessment forms the basis of the&#13;
         underwriting of insurance contracts, setting of premium levels, and provisioning for claims.&#13;
         	Project-specific risk assessment is performed by a cross-functional team. Based on the analysis of project-specific risk factors within the country&#13;
         context, the final project risk ratings can be higher or lower than the country ratings of a specific coverage. The decision to issue an insurance contract&#13;
         is subject to approval by MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Senior Management and concurrence by the Board of Directors. In order to avoid excessive risk concentration, MIGA&#13;
         sets exposure limits per country and per project. The maximum net exposure which may be assumed by MIGA is $600 million in each host country&#13;
         and $180 million for each project.&#13;
         		     As approved by the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the maximum aggregate amount of contingent liabilities that may be&#13;
         assumed by MIGA is 350 percent of the sum of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s unimpaired subscribed capital and its retained earnings, and insurance portfolio reserve&#13;
         plus such portion of the insurance ceded by MIGA through contracts of reinsurance as the Board of 	           Directors may determine. Accordingly, at June 30,&#13;
         2008, the maximum level of guarantees outstanding (including reinsurance) may not exceed $11,593,000,000.&#13;

&amp;#12;Portfolio Diversification&#13;
&#13;
MIGA aims to diversify its guarantee portfolio so as to limit the concentration of exposure to loss in a host country, region, or sector. The portfolio&#13;
shares of the top five and top ten largest exposure countries provide a convenient indicator of concentration risk. The gross and net exposures of the&#13;
top five and top ten countries at June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007 are as follows:&#13;

A regionally diversified portfolio is desirable for MIGA as an insurer, because correlations of claims occurrences are typically higher within a region&#13;
than between regions. When a correlation is higher, the probability of simultaneous occurrences of claims will be higher.&#13;

     MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s gross reserve for claims at June 30, 2008 amounted to $191,000,000 ($184,200,000 -June 30, 2007) and estimated reinsurance recoverables&#13;
     amounted to $33,600,000 ($35,800,000 -June 30, 2007). Accordingly, a provision for claims of $9,000,000 was recorded for the fiscal year ended June&#13;

     The provision of $9,000,000 for claims, net of reinsurance for the year ended June 30, 2008 compared to a release of $3,726,000 for the year ended&#13;
     June 30, 2007 has primarily resulted from the increase in the level of guarantee exposure impacting the insurance portfolio reserves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Specific Reserve for Claims&#13;
&#13;
     The specific reserve for claims is composed of reserves for pending claims and reserves for contracts where a claimable event has been reported but&#13;
     no claim has been filed. The parameters used in calculating the specific reserves, i.e. claims probability, severity and expected recovery, are assessed for&#13;
     each contract placed in the specific reserves on a quarterly basis. At June 30, 2008, the specific reserves amounted to $55,200,000 ($58,400,000 â&#128;&#147; June&#13;
     30, 2007).&#13;
     	The following table shows how the estimates of the specific reserves for each reporting period have developed over the past six years:&#13;

&amp;#12;Pending Claims&#13;
&#13;
Included in Specific Reserve for Claims at June 30, 2008 are three claims. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s actual liability for these claims has not yet been determined.&#13;
	On January 24, 2008, MIGA received a claim for a project in Kenya. The amount of loss was not specified in the claim. The maximum aggregate&#13;
liability under the contract is $0.5 million. MIGA has requested the Guarantee Holder to furnish the required information for it to proceed with claims&#13;
determination, which has still not been delivered.&#13;
	On November 29, 2006, MIGA received a claim in the amount of $54 million for expropriation of a project in Nicaragua. The Guarantee Holder&#13;
asserted that the project had been expropriated due to its inability to obtain approvals for tariff adjustments in accordance with the terms of the con-&#13;
cession agreements for distribution of electricity and other acts of the Government of Nicaragua (GoN), which have rendered the project unviable. The&#13;
GoN and the guarantee investor have been in negotiation of settlement of the dispute and the processing of the claim has been suspended pending&#13;
the results of those discussions.&#13;
	On October 6, 2004, MIGA received claims for expropriation of projects in Kyrgyz Republic, in the amount of $0.9 million. A Settlement Agreement&#13;
has been negotiated, but is not yet effective due to delays on the part of the Government of Kyrgyzstan (GOK). MIGA is maintaining the provision for&#13;
this matter until the agreement is implemented.&#13;
&#13;
Claims Payable&#13;
&#13;
On January 10, 2005, MIGA made a determination to pay an expropriation claim received on January 13, 2004 for losses related to a project in&#13;
Argentina. The total claim amounted to $1,395,778, of which $558,311 (representing forty percent) was paid on February 24, 2005. The payment of the&#13;
remaining $837,467 (representing sixty percent) was recorded in â&#128;&#156;Accounts payable and accrued expensesâ&#128;&#157; in the liability section of the balance sheet&#13;
for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The remaining payment was contingent upon the Guarantee Holder&#13;
fulfilling certain obligations in accordance with the Contract of Guarantee on or before December 31, 2006. As of the end of the December 31, 2006,&#13;
those conditions had not been met and on January 4, 2007, the Guarantee Holder withdrew the remaining claim. Accordingly, MIGA has reduced the&#13;
Liability in the Balance Sheet and transferred this amount as a reduction of Expenses under â&#128;&#156;Release of provision due to withdrawal of claims.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Note Fâ&#128;&#148;Pension and Other Post retirement Benefits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MIGA, IBRD and IFC participate in a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and a Post-Employment Benefits&#13;
Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of their staff members.&#13;
	The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to&#13;
eligible retirees. The PEBP provides certain pension benefits administered outside the SRP.&#13;
	The United States Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) established a prescription drug benefit&#13;
under Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a federal subsidy to qualifying sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. The effects of the subsidy and the&#13;
related disclosures have been reflected in the financial statements.&#13;
	     MIGA uses June 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The amounts presented below reflect MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
respective share of the costs, assets, and liabilities of the plans.&#13;
	     All costs, assets and liabilities associated with these plans are allocated between MIGA, IBRD, and IFC based upon their employeesâ&#128;&#153; respective&#13;
participation in the plans. In addition, MIGA and IFC reimburse IBRD for their proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
Contributions to these plans are calculated as a percentage of salary.&#13;

&amp;#12;         Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
         The actuarial assumptions used are based on financial market interest rates, past experience, and managementâ&#128;&#153;s best estimate of future benefit&#13;
         changes and economic conditions. Changes in these assumptions will impact future benefit costs and obligations.&#13;
         	The expected long-term rate of return for the SRP assets is a weighted average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for the various&#13;
         asset classes, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed using a forward-looking building block approach and are not&#13;
         strictly based on historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected&#13;
         long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk premium/spread (as appro-&#13;
         priate). Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to equity and bond markets. The expected long-term rate of return for the RSBP is&#13;
         computed using procedures similar to those used for the SRP. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to&#13;
         the year-end AAA and AA corporate bonds.&#13;
         	      Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual results are different from expected results. Amortization of these unrecognized gains and losses will&#13;
         be included in income if, at the beginning of the fiscal year, they exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related&#13;
         value of plan assets. If required, the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the expected average remaining service lives of the employee&#13;
         group.&#13;
         	The following tables present the weighted-average assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic&#13;

         Investment Strategy&#13;
         The investment policy for the SRP and the RSBP is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the respective planâ&#128;&#153;s needs and goals,&#13;
         using a global diversified portfolio of various asset classes. Specifically, the long-term asset allocation is based on an analysis that incorporates expected&#13;
         returns by asset class as well as volatilities and correlations across asset classes and the liability profile of the respective plans. This analysis, referred&#13;
         to as an asset-liability analysis, also provides estimates of potential future contributions and future asset and liability balances. In October 2007, a new&#13;
         strategic asset allocation was approved by the Pension Finance Committee. This resulted in a change to the allocation of fixed income, public equity&#13;

&amp;#12;and alternatives. In addition, three new alternative asset classes were introduced: timber, infrastructure and commodities. The new investment policy is&#13;
reflected in the table below. Plan assets are managed by external investment managers and monitored by IBRDâ&#128;&#153;s pension investment department. The&#13;
pension plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of public equity, fixed income, and alternative investments.&#13;

Expected Contributions&#13;
&#13;
MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s contribution to the SRP and RSBP varies from year to year, as determined by the Pension Finance Committee, which bases its judgment on the&#13;
results of annual actuarial valuations of the assets and liabilities of the SRP and RSBP. The best estimate of the amount of contributions expected to be&#13;
paid to the SRP and RSBP for MIGA during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008 is $627,000 and $400,000, respectively.&#13;

&#13;
     MIGA contributes its share of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s corporate costs which include the Council of Governors and the Board of Directors, the&#13;
     Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s office, the Corporate Secretariat, the Internal Auditing Department, the Department of Institutional Integrity, and the Conflict Resolution&#13;
     Services. In addition, MIGA obtains certain administrative and support services from IBRD in those areas where services can be most efficiently&#13;
     provided by IBRD. These include human resources, information systems, and administrative services as well as investment management and treasury&#13;
     operations. Payments for these services are made by MIGA to IBRD based on negotiated fees, charge backs and allocated charges where charge back is&#13;
     not feasible. Total fees paid by MIGA to IBRD for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was $6,180,800 ($6,394,000 â&#128;&#147; June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         NOTE Hâ&#128;&#148;FAIR VALUE measurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between&#13;
     market participants at the measurement date. MIGA uses observable market data, when available, and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs&#13;
     when determining fair value. The fair values of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s cash and non-negotiable, non interest-bearing demand obligations approximate their carrying&#13;
     values. The fair values of government obligations are based on quoted market prices and the fair values of asset backed securities are based on pricing&#13;
     models for which market observable inputs are used. The degree to which management judgment is involved in determining the fair value of a financial&#13;
     instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and&#13;
     have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. Substantially all of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     financial instruments use either of the foregoing methodologies to determine fair values that are recorded on its financial statements. The fair values&#13;
     are only indicative of individual financial instrument values and should not be considered an indication of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s fair value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         NOTE Iâ&#128;&#148;Risk Management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The responsibility for approving MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s risk management policies lies with the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of the Board deals with risk&#13;
     management issues.&#13;
     	     While the Executive Vice President assumes the responsibility for overall risk management with the support of the senior management team, the&#13;
     responsibility for the design and operational implementation of the risk management framework lies with the Finance and Risk Management Group&#13;
     with coordination from the Legal Affairs and Claims Group, the Operations Group and the Economics and Policy Group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Risk Categories&#13;
     MIGA is exposed to a variety of risks and uses risk management programs such as an Economic Capital Framework, and reinsurance arrangements to&#13;
     manage its risk. Below is a description of risk management systems of the important risks for MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
     Insurance Risk 	 Political risk assessment forms an integral part of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s underwriting process, and includes the analysis of both country-related&#13;
     and project-related risks. Insurance risk arises from MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s core business of issuing investment guarantees. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s earnings depend upon the extent&#13;
     to which claims experience is consistent with assumptions used in setting prices for products and establishing technical provisions and liabilities for&#13;
     claims. If actual claims experience of the agency is less favorable than underlying assumptions, then income would be reduced. MIGA monitors claim&#13;
     activities and provisions for pending claims.	&#13;
     	      In order to prevent excessive risk concentration, MIGA sets exposure limits per country and per project. MIGA uses an Economic Capital model&#13;
     to evaluate concentration risk in MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s guarantee portfolio and to support decision making in pricing new large projects, or new projects in countries&#13;
     with large exposure. Its reinsurance program, including treaty and facultative reinsurance, helps manage the risk profile of the portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
     Credit Risk Counter-party credit risk in MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s portfolio is the risk that reinsurers would fail to pay their share of a claim. MIGA requires that private&#13;
     sector reinsurers, with which it conducts business, be rated by at least two of the four major rating agencies (Standard &amp; Poorâ&#128;&#153;s, A.M. Best, Moodyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     and Fitch), and that the ratings be above a minimum threshold. Also, MIGA has established limits at both the project and portfolio levels, which restrict&#13;
     the amount of reinsurance.&#13;
     	                MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s investment portfolio does not have any significant credit risk exposure. MIGA currently invests in fixed income securities with&#13;
           At present 	&#13;
     high credit quality. The Investment Authorization stipulates that government or agency sponsored debt securities be AA-rated or above, time deposits&#13;
     be A-rated or above, and corporate debt securities be AAA-rated.&#13;
&#13;
     Interest Rate Risk Interest rate changes affect the market values of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s invested assets. A need to liquidate assets to pay for claims in an unfa-&#13;
     vorable interest rate environment may generate trading losses and reduce investment income. Changes in interest rates will also affect prepayment&#13;
     speeds of mortgage and asset backed security holdings, which may affect the duration of the asset portfolio. A 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield&#13;
     curve could impact the net income in FY08 by approximately $9.6 million (FY07: $8.1 million). This interest rate sensitivity is illustrative only and is&#13;
     based on simplified scenarios. The impact of a parallel shift in interest rates is determined using market value weighted portfolio duration applied to&#13;
     invested asset balance at year end.&#13;
&#13;
     Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The majority of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s assets and contingent liabilities are denominated in USD, but some guarantee contracts are&#13;
     issued in other currencies such as EUR. To the extent that a claim is made in a non-USD currency and requires payment in excess of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s holdings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
94   |   MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 08 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&amp;#12;of that currency, MIGA may face a foreign exchange related loss in converting to the needed currency to pay for a claim. A 10% change in the&#13;
USD/Euro year end exchange rate could impact the net income in FY08 by approximately $12.3 million (FY07: $9.4 million) and net guarantee&#13;
exposure by approximately $74.0 million (FY07: $67.2 million). This foreign exchange rate sensitivity is illustrative only and is based on simplified&#13;
scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
Operational Risk 	Operational risk is intrinsic to financial institutions and is an important component of the agency-wide risk management&#13;
framework. The most important types of operational risk involve breakdowns in internal controls and corporate governance.&#13;
	     MIGA attempts to mitigate operational risks by maintaining a sound internal control system. Since 2000, MIGA has adopted COSO inte-&#13;
grated internal control framework, in line with IBRD/IDA and IFC, to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of internal control system. In addition,&#13;
MIGA has introduced an operational risk management system to strengthen monitoring of the operational risks and controls in the financial&#13;
reporting process, and the effectiveness of key controls in the financial reporting process are assessed through the internal quality assurance&#13;
review process. In FY08 MIGA conducted COSO Risk &amp; Opportunity workshops and actions are being taken to address the recommendations.&#13;
	     MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s internal control system is regularly evaluated through independent review by the Internal Audit Department (IAD) of the World Bank&#13;
Group. Most recently, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s Entity Level Controls were reviewed by IAD. MIGA Management has been following up on the recommendations&#13;
for further improvement of internal controls in these areas.&#13;
	     With regard to information technology, all MIGA Information Systems and applications are hosted on the IBRD technology infrastructure&#13;
that is configured and adherent to the information security policy and procedures of the World Bank Group. In addition, increased collaboration&#13;
with the World Bank has allowed MIGA to gain access to a larger pool of specialized skill sets to support the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s information systems.&#13;
MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s client relationship management system (MIGA CRM) is fully integrated with the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s core financial system (Guarantee Database).&#13;
Its content is reviewed and verified against an external AML/CFT database service. In addition, MIGA is currently undergoing a redesign of its&#13;
core information system for managing and reporting data for activities supporting the guarantee process and its migration to a more robust&#13;
SAP-based platform. The replacement system will allow for a more efficient and reliable database functionality to manage all key guarantee data,&#13;
and enable the entire underwriting process to be done online. This is intended to be more efficient and to enhance the quality and the ability to&#13;
share information internally and externally with the World Bank Group.&#13;
	     For business continuity, MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s corporate web services have now been added to MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s information systems already hosted at the World&#13;
Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Business Continuity Center. In addition, MIGA departments have further documented their business processes required to support&#13;
the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s effort to re-establish basic operations following a crisis. For data security, more robust reporting functions and security monitoring&#13;
have been implemented to further enhance MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s information security.&#13;
&#13;
Legal Risk Legal risks arise primarily from changes in the legal parameters of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s member countries as a result of legislation or court&#13;
decisions that may affect MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s activities. There are also legal risks associated with MIGA being involved in legal disputes and arbitration pro-&#13;
ceedings, especially in the context of claim resolution or settlement.&#13;
	     MIGA manages these risks by monitoring current and prospective future developments by way of ongoing discussions with member&#13;
countriesâ&#128;&#153; representatives on the Board of Directors and Council of Governors. MIGA also shares information and analyses with other members&#13;
of the World Bank Group, the IMF and the United Nations. In addition, MIGA actively participates as a member of the Berne Union in discussions&#13;
and analyses of the changes in the operating investment environment in its member countries.&#13;
&#13;
Economic Capital and Portfolio Risk Modeling&#13;
For portfolio risk management purposes, MIGA currently utilizes an Economic Capital Model, based on the latent factor model of the Merton&#13;
framework in credit risk modeling. The Economic Capital (EC) concept is a widely recognized risk management tool in the banking and insurance&#13;
industries, defining the amount of capital an organization needs to hold in order to sustain larger than expected losses with a high degree of&#13;
certainty, over a defined time horizon and given the risk exposure and defined risk tolerance. MIGA defines its economic capital as the 99.99th&#13;
percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one year horizon, minus the mean of the loss distribution, which is in line with industry&#13;
practice.&#13;
	The model helps evaluate concentration risk in the guarantee portfolio and facilitates active, risk-based exposure management by allocating&#13;
the Economic Capital to particular regions, countries, sectors, covers, or individual contracts, based on their respective risk contribution. 	&#13;
	     MIGA employs the EC model to manage its insurance portfolio risks as the cornerstone of its capital adequacy framework. In addition, it&#13;
provides the analytical basis for risk-based pricing of its products as well as quantification of the need for prudent technical provisions for claims&#13;
and liquidity holdings. An extensive review of MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s EC and pricing models was completed in the first quarter of FY08, with the objective to&#13;
validate critical parameters and to fully integrate the two models. This helps ensure consistency between pricing, portfolio exposure management,&#13;
and provisioning. Moreover, beginning in FY08, EC-based risk measures are combined with exposure and income information for a compre-&#13;
hensive portfolio overview report prepared for MIGA management on a monthly basis.&#13;

            the previous year. International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            committed 11.4 billion dollars and mobilized an additional
            4.8 billion dollars for private sector investments in
            developing countries, more than 40 percent of which were in
            IDA eligible countries. Multilateral Investment Guarantee
            Agency (MIGA) issued close to 2.1 billion dollars in
            guarantees in support of investments in the developing
            world, an increase of 730 million dollars over 2007. Of the
            total, 689.6 million dollars went to IDA-eligible countries.
            This year, MIGA's operating income was 55 million
            dollars, compared with 49 million dollars in FY07. The
            increase of 6 million dollars was due to an increase in net
            premium income and investment income and a decrease in the
            agency's administrative expenses. FY08 net income
            increased by 3.4 million dollars compared to FY07, primarily
            due to higher guarantee income and investment income and
            translation gains.
