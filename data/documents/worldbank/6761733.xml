&#13;
                                          I. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
 3.  The objective of the IDA operation is to provide support to the Government o f Tanzania inreforming&#13;
 the delivery o f secondary education through the SEDP as part of the implementation o f the Education&#13;
 Sector Development Program (ESDP). The long term aim o f the SEDP is to build a productive and&#13;
 adoptable labor force as well as supplying better quality students for higher levels o f the post-secondary&#13;
 education and training system. This would help increase and sustain growth o f the national economy, and&#13;
 allow Tanzania to participate more effectively in the global economy. SEDP also aims at reducing&#13;
 poverty by increasing the proportion of students from poor households and communities complete&#13;
 secondary education that would enable them to enter the labor market. The specific objectives of the&#13;
 SEDP are to: (i)expand access by increasing the proportion o f the relevant age group completing&#13;
 secondary education (ii) improve quality through raising the learning achievements of students, especially&#13;
 girls; and (iii)&#13;
                strengthen management by enabling the public administration system to manage secondary&#13;
 education more effectively. Policy measures adopted by the Government aimed at achieving these&#13;
 objectives include interventions to: (a) make more efficient use of resources, (b) provide capitation and&#13;
 development grants to schools and communities (c) expand teacher supply, (d) lower household costs for&#13;
 secondary education, by reducing tuition fees in day schools and expanding the scholarship program for&#13;
 students from very poor households, and (e) enhance partnership with the non-government sector.&#13;
&#13;
 4. Substantial progress i s being made towards achieving the objectives through implementation o f the&#13;
 policy measures. Gross Enrolment (GER) in secondary education increased from 7.4 percent in 2003 to&#13;
 9.4 and 11.7 in 2004 and 2005 respectively (Basic Education Statistics in Tanzania 1995-2005).&#13;
Enrolment o f Form Istudents in Ordinary Level secondary education has increased from 98,738 in 2004&#13;
to 134,963 in 2005. The expansionhas been supported by increases in Government recurrent budget, and&#13;
 investments through the SEDP program. This has greatly helpedto (i) enrolment capacity o f some&#13;
                                                                         expand&#13;
of the existing schools through construction of additional classrooms and establishment o f new schools;&#13;
(ii)recruitmentand deployment ofadditionalteachers; (iii)provisionalofscholarships to pupilsfrom&#13;
very poor households who cannot afford secondary education, as well as reduced school fees in public&#13;
day secondary schools most o f which were initiated by communities; and (iv) provision o f capitation&#13;
grants to school to enable financing o f teaching materials and textbooks. Nevertheless, the demand for&#13;
inore infrastructure, teachers and learning materials in secondary education enroIment i s expected to&#13;
increase further given the planned enrolment targets and the increased number of primary education&#13;
completers resulting from free universal primary education. The Gross Enrolment ratio (NER) in primary&#13;
education was 106.4 percent in 2005 compared to only 11.7 percent in secondary education. The&#13;
Government's target is to ensure 50 percent o f the age group complete lower secondary education by&#13;
2010 compared to 5-6 percent in 2003. In general, communities are pleased that more children are now&#13;
getting access to secondary education. Schools have also been able to purchase more textbooks and&#13;
teaching materials given the increased financial resources directed to school levels through capitation&#13;
grants. Private publishers and booksellers have also become inore active given the launching o f private&#13;
publishingo f school materials and textbooks.&#13;
&#13;
Macro-EconomicDevelopments&#13;
5. Since 1995, the government has shown constant commitment to macroeconomic structural reforms&#13;
which have helped to enhance stabilization o f the economy. Over the last five years the GDP growth rate&#13;
has averaged more than five percent. Tanzania economy grew by 6.7 percent in 2004 and estimated to&#13;
have grown by 6.9 percent in 2005. Mining and construction grew by 15.6 and 11 percent in 2004&#13;
respectively. The agricultural sector which i s important in the poverty reduction efforts inTanzania, grew&#13;
by 6 percent in 2004.while it is estimated to have declined to 5.3 percent in 2005 due to lack o f enough&#13;
rain. Agriculture contributes about 46 percent of Tanzania's GDP and about 86 percent of households&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       3&#13;
 depend on agriculture for their livelihood. There i s also an increased growth in the manufacturing sector&#13;
 to 7 percent in 2004. Investmenthas been growing more than the GDP to a ratio o f 17 percent in 2001 to&#13;
 21 percent in 2004. Both public and private investments increased at the level o f 7.7 and 13.2 percent&#13;
 respectively in 2004. Foreign direct investment continues to be key in the Tanzanian investment with&#13;
 increased external financial flows.      Export trade has more than doubled between 2000 and 2004&#13;
 particularly in the aspects o f gold and tourism industries. Sustainability of these growth rates i s expected&#13;
 to help reduce poverty by half in 2015.&#13;
&#13;
 6. Total Central Government Expenditures increased from 22 percent o f GDP in 2003/04 to 25 percent&#13;
 of the GDP in 2004/05. The increase was a result o f (i) improved performance o f domestic revenue which&#13;
 rose from 13.0 to 13.6 percent of the GDP; (ii)domestic and foreign borrowing. Importantly, domestic&#13;
 borrowing scaled up in 2004/05 amounting 1.1 percent after several years of negative borrowing. The&#13;
 Public Expenditure (PER) and Financial Accountability Reviews involving a broad spectrum o f&#13;
 stakeholders i s the key forum through which fiscal management and performance are assessed. The&#13;
 process i s particularly essential for General Budget Support. Currently, the government is reviewing the&#13;
 PER process to ensure it is more aligned to the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction for Poverty&#13;
 (NSGRP) and the budget process with review process o f different sectors. This would also help to&#13;
 strengthen the quality and efficiency in public expenditure.Monetary supply has in general grown to 25.5&#13;
 percent in 2004/05. This i s consistent with the inflation rate which fell to 4.1 percent in the same year.&#13;
 Aid flow has increased causing high interest rates which could cause negative consequences to private&#13;
 sector growth. The situation i s however manageable given the declining rate o f inflation over the recent&#13;
 years.&#13;
&#13;
 Growth and PovertyReduction&#13;
 7. The National Strategy for Growth and Reduction o f Poverty (NSGRP) i s a second national organizing&#13;
 framework focusing on poverty reduction within the national vision 2025. The framework was approved&#13;
 by the Cabinet in February2005 spelling out three key clusters of poverty reduction outcomes aimed at (i)&#13;
 reducing income poverty particularly in rural areas where 87 percent o f the poor live; (ii)improving&#13;
 quality o f life and social wellbeing; and (iij) strengthening governance and accountability.&#13;
Implementation of the NGSRP is underway and would require an estimated GDP growth rate o f 6-8&#13;
percent per annum up to 2015. In order to achieve this, the focus i s to increase investments towards&#13;
modernizing small, medium and large scale agricultural enterprises including agro-processing to benefit&#13;
poor communities. Attention is also provided to ensure improved trade, services and markets,&#13;
infrastructure and creation o f a conducive environment for private investment. Specifically, this would&#13;
also entail rising of the number of post-primary and post-secondary completers for improved technologies&#13;
and knowledge required for growth o f the economy. A household budget survey carried out in 2000/01&#13;
showed a rather modest decline in poverty from 42.8 percent in 1992 to 38.6 in 2001. Projections show&#13;
that poverty declined further to 33.8 percent in 2004. The projected growth rates to be achieved through&#13;
implementatioii o f the NGSRP are expected to reduce poverty further by 2015.&#13;
&#13;
RecentDevelopmentsinNon-incomeDimensions of Poverty and Public Service Delivery&#13;
8. HIV/AIDS i s still a challenge to Tanzania with a prevalence rate o f 7 percent (7.7 and 6.3 percent for&#13;
females and males respectively). Recent developments in Tanzania's fight against HIV/AIDS include the&#13;
establishment o f the Tanzania Commission for AIDS (TACAIDS) which has a fully staffed secretariat&#13;
since January 2003, and the appointment o f members o f the coinmission including representatives from&#13;
civil society. The Government has increased its allocation o f financial resources for implementing&#13;
HIV/AIDS interventions guided by the multi-sectoral strategic framework which was launched in 2003&#13;
under implementation by government and non-government actors. A recent HIV/AIDS report indicates&#13;
that the Government has increased spending on HIV/AIDS by 79 percent since 2002/2003. External&#13;
support for HIV/AIDS has also increased representing90 percent of the overall expenditure. The World&#13;
Bank is among the agencies supporting the Government o f Tanzania in implementing its HIV/AIDS&#13;
strategy through the Tanzania Multisectoral Aids Project (TMAP). This includes the Clinton Foundation&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                     4&#13;
 expected to support care and treatment to about 400,000 people living with HIV/AIDS with an estimated&#13;
 cost o f about US$535 million over five years.&#13;
&#13;
 9. Education. Government is committed to increase access, quality and equity at all levels o f the&#13;
 education system. Key measures in the achievement of these objectives are being implemented through&#13;
 the Primary Education Development Program (PEDP) supported jointly by the government and&#13;
 development partners. The measures have included abolition of primary school fees in2001 and increased&#13;
 budgetary allocations to include among other things, provision of development and capitation grants to&#13;
 schools. Other measures have included increased pre-service training o f teachers and supporting them&#13;
 through continuous professional development. There is positive impact being achieved from the PEDP&#13;
 implementation towards universal completion of quality primary education. As a result o f the PEDP&#13;
 implementation, the NERhas increased from 65.8 percent in 2001 to 94.8 percent in 2005.&#13;
&#13;
 10. The Secondary Education Development Program (SEDP) is being implemented inmost communities&#13;
 in the country. The measures have included reduction of fees and provision of scholarships to qualified&#13;
 students from very poor households to ensure equitable access to secondary education. There have been&#13;
 also increases in budgetary allocations which has enabled disbursement of development and capitation&#13;
 grants to schools; increased pre-service training o f teachers at diploma and degree levels as well as&#13;
 recruitment o f licensed teachers; teacher deployment to needy schools i s also being implemented. The&#13;
 number o f government secondary schools increased from 528 in 2001, 828 in 2004 and to 1202 in 2005.&#13;
 However, teacher supply and quality enhancement remains a big challenge to the expanding secondary&#13;
 education system. Measures to address the issue are underway through enrolment expansion for degree&#13;
 and diploma level teachers. Intake at degree level increased from 300 students in 2004 to 700 in 2005.&#13;
 Diploma level training also increased from an enrolment of 2,400 students to 3,573 in 2005, and about&#13;
 4000 students are planned to be enrolled in 2006. The Government is also in the process o f developing a&#13;
comprehensive strategy for teacher development, and management.&#13;
&#13;
 11. The Government is also committed to improve higher and technical education to ensure increased&#13;
access and equity, efficiency and quality. Interventions aimed at expanding the system have started&#13;
including provision of student loans to both public and private higher education institutions to ensure&#13;
increased enrolment and equitable access.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       11.     PROGRESSAGAINST TRANCHE         RELEASE    CRITERIA&#13;
&#13;
 12. The government has made good progress in implementing the Secondary Education Program. In&#13;
particular, the Agreed Actions for the second tranche release as stipulated in Part A o f Schedule 2 to the&#13;
Development Financing Agreement (DFA) have been implemented as summarized below. Evidence o f&#13;
the implementation i s provided through the respective annexes.&#13;
&#13;
Condition 1: The Borrower has allocated appropriate budgetary resources for FY 2004-2005 on&#13;
the basis of criteria and norms referred to in paragraph - of the LDP as required to ensure&#13;
adequate staffing levels and delivery of capitation, development and scholarship grants for&#13;
Government Schools.         The key indicators include: (i)Allocation of appropriate budgetary&#13;
resources for 2004-2005;        (ii)Adequate staffing;      and (iii) Delivery of capitation grants,&#13;
development grants,and scholarships grants. Thecondition is met.&#13;
&#13;
13. Allocation of appropriate budaetarv resources: Recurrent budget allocation for the full education&#13;
sector increased by 28 percent in FY 2004/05 and by 11 percent in 2005/06. Recurrent allocations to the&#13;
secondary education sub-sector increased with 20 percent between2003/04 and 2004/05, and with further&#13;
23 percent by 2005/06. The increases in recurrent budget are sufficient to finance the increases in&#13;
teaching staff. Recurrent expenditures financed over the development budget increased significantly in&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                    5&#13;
the period as the program funds became available. Thus, total increase in recurrent expenditures was&#13;
 about 80 percent from 2003/04 to 2004/05. There are coiicerns about sustainability of the expansion&#13;
 given the high share of recurrent expendituresfinancedover the development budget from program funds.&#13;
 These funds are utilized to finance capitation grants for learning materials, school based seminars for&#13;
professional development of teachers and related quality enhancement initiatives at school levels.&#13;
Development expenditure increasedfrom Tshs. 5 billion to 39.9 billions.&#13;
&#13;
 14. Adequate staffing: An objective of the program is that pupil-teacher ratio will be of 30:l by 2009.&#13;
Evidence provided by tlie Borrower shows that the situation is improving to ensure every teacher has&#13;
enough workload in accordance with tlie establishedguidelines and norms stipulated inthe Mechanisms&#13;
                                                                                             "&#13;
for Posting Teachers to Government Secondary Schoolsfor the Secondary Education Development Plan&#13;
2004-2009". The pupil teacher ratio was 20: 1 in 2003 and has improved to 26.1 by June 2005 (Basic&#13;
Education Statistics 2005). However, teacher demand keeps on increasing given the ongoing expansion&#13;
of secondary education. In this regard more teachers were recruited and deployed between 2004 and&#13;
2005. The first batch of the new teachers employedconsisted of 305 licensedteachers who had completed&#13;
Advanced Level secondary education. These teachers were recruited and trained for one month to&#13;
familiarize themselves with the teacliing profession. Upon completion of tlie training, they were awarded&#13;
each, a teaching license. The second batch consisted of 1467 diploma and degree level teachers who had&#13;
completed training from different institutions. Altogether a total of 1772 licensed, diploma and degree&#13;
level teachers were employed and deployed to different needy schools including underserved areas.&#13;
Delivery of degree level teachers has remained low for many years with a ratio of 20: 80 degree and&#13;
diploma level respectively. In order to increase the number of degree level teachers, the government&#13;
converted the Chang'ombe Teacher Training College, and Mkwawa High School to Constituent&#13;
Education Colleges under the University of Dar es Salaam in August 2005. As a result, degree level&#13;
enrolment in the public institutions has increased from 300 students in 2004/05 to 700 in 2005/06.&#13;
Enrolment of candidates for teacher training at diploma level increased from 2,689 in 2004 to 3,593 in&#13;
2005. Enrolment in 2006 for diploma level is expectedto increase to 4000 students.&#13;
&#13;
15. In order to have a long term strategy on teacher supply and development, the Government plans to&#13;
strengthen the teacher development system further. Terms of Reference (TOR) for this activity were&#13;
developed and approved by different stakeholders involving the Government, Development Partners and&#13;
the Civil Society Organisations participating in the Basic Education Development Committee (BEDC).&#13;
Based on tlie TOR an invitation for expression of interest for the "Teacher Development and&#13;
Management Strategy (TDMV has been implemented. An inception report for the strategy will be&#13;
finalised inMid April 2006.&#13;
&#13;
16. Capitation Grants: According to the program, capitation grants for learning materials and textbooks&#13;
would be disbursed to secondary schools at a rate of Tshs.25,000 per pupil per year. Government&#13;
allocated about 3 billion shillings for these as recurrent expenditures under the development budget&#13;
against projected 7.8 billion shillings. An amount of Tshs. 4, 280,220,000 was disbursed to 803 schools&#13;
(with 214,011 students) out of tlie 828 Government schools which were registered by 2004 with a total&#13;
enrolment of 264,888 students. The amount disbursed to these schools was approximately Tshs 20, 000&#13;
per student which was a bit less than tlie planned grant of Tshs. 25,000. Nevertheless 97 percent of the&#13;
schools registered by 2004 and 87 percent of the student body during tlie same period got capitation&#13;
grants.&#13;
&#13;
17. More fbnds will be required for the grants in the 2006 academic year given the increasednumber of&#13;
government secondary schools, students' enrolments, as well as the need to provide the full capitation&#13;
grants up to Tshs. 25,000 per student. The number of schools registered increased to 1202 with a total&#13;
enrolment of 355,188 students by June 2005. Importantly, the capitation grants disbursed already to the&#13;
803 government schools have enabled the schools to purchase text books and teaching materials, thus&#13;
contributing to quality improvement inteaching and learning&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                      6&#13;
 18. Development Grants; The program stipulates that Development Grants would be allocated based on&#13;
the extent the area i s underserved. About 34 billion shillings are allocated for development expenditures&#13;
in the budget for 04/05. As it turns out, about 930 government schools in different districts and&#13;
communities have benefited froin the grants. A total of Tshs 19,587,000,000 were disbursed to bank&#13;
accounts o f these schools to (i)expand the capacities o f existing schools through construction o f more&#13;
new classroom and furnishing (ii)rehabilitation and maintenance of school facilities (iii)construction of&#13;
new schools and (iv) construction o f teacher houses, assembly halls, hostels, toilets and girls private&#13;
rooins, and other necessary facilities. About 1569 new classrooms were constructed to expand school&#13;
enrolment out of a target o f 1914. About 425 new schools were constructed with a few classroom in&#13;
underserved areas that had a considerable population o f primary education completers. Construction of&#13;
more classrooins in these new schools is planned in 2006 to ensure the schools get enough classroom to&#13;
operate in full capacity. Enrolment into Advanced Level secondary education also increased from 15,925&#13;
students to 18,154 in the same period.&#13;
&#13;
 19. Scholarship Grants; About 23,587 students froin very poor households studying in Form 1, 2, and 3&#13;
are benefiting froin the scholarship program that started in 2003. Management o f the program i s guided&#13;
by the "Guidelines for Provision of scholarship Grants to Secondary School PupilsJi.om Low Income&#13;
Households" to support the identified eligible pupils. The total amount of funds disbursed to schools with&#13;
scholarship students in the 2005 academic year was Tshs.4,235 inillions at an average o f Tshs.180,000&#13;
per student . The ainount covered expenses for fees, uniforms, medical, pocket money and transport. Out&#13;
o f the scholarship students, 12,020 (5,101 girls and 6,919 boys) o f them were in Form I in the 2005&#13;
school year.&#13;
&#13;
Condition 2: The Borrower has adopted a package of incentives designed to attract and keep&#13;
teachers in underservedareas. The condition is met.&#13;
&#13;
20. The Government has adopted a policy o f constructing teacher houses, particular in undeserved areas.&#13;
Availability o f teacher houses within school compounds, especially in communities where teachers&#13;
cannot find any houses to rent, has been one of the key incentives in deploying teachers. The Borrower&#13;
has indicated that, out of the total amounts of the Development Grants disbursed to schools, Tshs. 8,172&#13;
inillion was used for construction o f teacher houses especially in the remote areas. Government circular&#13;
number 12 of November 2004, provides guidelines for construction o f teacher houses particularly in&#13;
underserved areas with the aim of motivating teachers to teach in remote areas. As a result, 903 teacher's&#13;
houses were constructed in 888 different schools within local coininunities under the supervision o f&#13;
district council engineers. Teacher support system are being strengthened to reach teachers in remote&#13;
areas through school based continuous teacher development using accreditation and non-accreditation&#13;
programs. This has been mostly through programs organized by the Open University o f Tanzania using&#13;
distance education approaches and through the school inspectorate system.&#13;
&#13;
Condition 3: The Borrower has amended, in substance satisfactoryto the Association, its Circular&#13;
No., dated August 15, 1998 government mechanisms for approval of educational books.&#13;
condition is met.&#13;
&#13;
21. The Government has issued Education Circular Number 7 o f 2005, replacing Circular number 2 o f&#13;
1998 on the approval system of Educational Books and Materials. The current Circular, aims at&#13;
strengthening the approval system making it more transparent and efficient involving private, public and&#13;
civil society stakeholders. Further,the Circular re-enforces private book production and publishingwhich&#13;
was not the case in the previous years.&#13;
&#13;
Condition 4: The Borrower has adopted and implementeda program of actions designed to foster&#13;
continuous development of professional skills for teachers and school administrators for secondary&#13;
education across Borrower's territory (mainland).          Indicators: (i) Continuous Development of&#13;
Teachers; and (ii)Developmentof school administrators: The condition is met.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       7&#13;
 22. Continuous development of teachers: School-based training is ongoing at schools and within teacher&#13;
 training colleges delivered through distance education combined with short sessions o f face to face&#13;
 interactions. The training program is organised by the Open University o f Tanzania. About 505 science&#13;
 and mathematics teachers from various schools participated in short training for a period o f three weeks in&#13;
 2005 aimed at improving the teaching o f maths and sciences. About 71 diploma level teachers of maths&#13;
 and sciences are being supported by the government to attend degree level upgrading training at Tuinaini&#13;
 private university. Low performance o f students in maths and sciences was one o f the identified issues&#13;
 that would be addressed in the SEDP implementation. Upgrading o f secondary education teachers i s also&#13;
 ongoing using teacher colleges and the University of Dar es Salaam.&#13;
&#13;
 23. The school inspectorate system has been strengthened with increased transportation to enable zonal&#13;
 based inspectors to visit scliools more often to inspect schools and at the same time conduct school based&#13;
 seminars aimed at improving teaching levels and school management. A Training Manual for School&#13;
 Inspectors was developed in 2005 to provide guidance on among other things, school based training of&#13;
 teachers.&#13;
&#13;
 24. In order to equip college tutors with adequate skills for training primary and secondary education&#13;
 teachers, a total of 296 tutors from different Teacher Training Colleges are being trained by the Open&#13;
University of Tanzania using distance learning approaches, upgrading the tutors to degree levels. About&#13;
 14 tutors are also being trained for upgradingto post graduate Advanced Diploma level.&#13;
&#13;
25. Continous develo-pment of school administrators: About 3,800 actors responsible for management&#13;
and administration at schools and other levels were trained for a period of 10 days throughout the country.&#13;
The training was conducted in eight different zones and was attended by heads o f schools, members o f&#13;
school construction committees, regional and district engineers, and education officers at various levels.&#13;
The aim of the training was to inform people about the SEDP reforms in relation to roles o f the various&#13;
stakeholders at these different levels. A strategy to strengthen school management involving heads o f&#13;
schools and school boards is also underway. This includes strengthening o f the teacher support and&#13;
quality assurance systems through capacity building of School Inspectors at all levels. The school&#13;
inspectors in turn train school heads and school boards as well as other key players in management and&#13;
administration guided by the       "Training Manual for School Inspectors " designed by the respective&#13;
education mitiistry in2005.&#13;
&#13;
Condition 5:       The Borrower has reduced the level of tuition fees due by students attending&#13;
Government Schools (day schools) from Tshs. 40, 000 to 20,000 starting in 2005 school year.&#13;
Indicators: Government,Circular, Fees Compensation to schools. The condition is met.&#13;
&#13;
26. Government Circular Number 11 dated September 2004 issued by the Chief Education Officer&#13;
reduced school fees o f all government day secondary schools from Tshs. 40,000 to 20,000 (by 50 percent)&#13;
effective January 2005. The Circular was issued to Regional Administrative Secretaries, Zonal School&#13;
Inspectors, and all Heads of Secondary schools. Reports and other information sources indicate that the&#13;
policy is being implemented in all government day schools since January 2005. This has greatly&#13;
