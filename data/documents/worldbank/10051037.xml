Strategic Building Blocks for&#13;

24/7 Implementation Strategy&#13;
&#13;
Strategies for conversion from&#13;
intermittent to 24/7 supply will vary&#13;
between cities; however, essential&#13;
building blocks will be common to&#13;
all. These are:&#13;
&#13;
q Credible data on bulk supply and&#13;
&#13;
     distribution infrastructure, and&#13;
     accurate customer records.&#13;
     While this basic operational and&#13;
     management data is necessary for&#13;
     sound operations and management,&#13;
     it is generally not available in credible&#13;
     and usable forms in most Indian&#13;
     cities. Network plans should&#13;
     preferably be prepared on a GIS&#13;
     base, one of the foundations for&#13;
     modern management.&#13;
q A hydraulic model of the supply&#13;
&#13;
     system which would ensure that&#13;
&#13;
     bulk water fed into the system can&#13;
&#13;
     be distributed equitably to all parts&#13;
&#13;
     of the urban area. The system would&#13;

&#13;
 The Pnomh Penh Water Supply Authority has successfully completed a campaign to move from intermittent to continuous&#13;
&#13;
 supply over a period of eight years. In this time, piped supply coverage has increased from 50 percent to 99 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
 urban area, now serving approximately one million persons, NRW has been reduced from 60 percent to 25 percent. How this&#13;
&#13;
 was achieved, under difficult social and economic circumstances, was presented at the workshop.&#13;
&#13;
 The per capita GDP of Cambodia is about 50 percent of that of India and serves as an illustration that continuous supply does&#13;

 not depend upon the economic status of a country.&#13;

 Rehabilitation work began on the outdated and almost defunct Phnom Penh water utility in 1995. The utility had virtually&#13;
&#13;
 ceased functioning during the years of civil war, between 1975 and 1979. At the time the reform implementation process was&#13;
&#13;
 initiated, in 1995, NRW was estimated to be as much as 61 percent, with only 40 percent of the city's residents connected.&#13;
&#13;
 The reform process began with the government setting out goals and announcing a change in policy, advocating full cost&#13;
&#13;
 recovery for services and full autonomy for the service provider. The Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority announced support&#13;
&#13;
 for changes in managerial culture, including measures that would enhance autonomy, regulation, restructuring and streamlining&#13;
&#13;
 job responsibility and, above all, initiated measures to boost motivation and discipline among management and other staff.&#13;
&#13;
 A water loss control team was set up to monitor loss and NRW supply within a designated pilot zone, comprising 2,000&#13;
&#13;
 household connections, with a `water-tight boundary'. Staff were trained in such activities as valve operations, locating leakage&#13;
&#13;
 and detecting unauthorized connections. Only HDPE pipe was permitted for customer connections. Zoning and leak&#13;
&#13;
 detection was progressively introduced throughout the city, as was 24/7 supply, over a period of eight years.&#13;
&#13;
 Billing of the full cost of the water service was introduced, a major step in a country that had been used to subsidized and very&#13;
&#13;
 poor quality, intermittent water supply.&#13;
&#13;
 Some of the notable achievements of the program have been:&#13;
&#13;
 q Payment for water usage introduced in 1996, for the first time in the country.&#13;
&#13;
 q Full autonomy granted to the utility in 1997.&#13;
&#13;
 q Virtually no unauthorized connections were in existence by end-1997.&#13;
&#13;
 q Increase in new unauthorized connections fell from 300 per year to three per year.&#13;
&#13;
 q Physical loss due to leakage reduced to 23 percent by end-2001 (though the target had&#13;
&#13;
      been 35 percent) and to 20 percent by June 2002 (though the target was 25 percent by end-2003).&#13;
&#13;
 q Savings from control of losses (arising from both physical leakage and NRW) estimated at&#13;
&#13;
      22 US cents per m3.&#13;
&#13;
 q Tariffs raised in December 2000 (after credibility of the service established).&#13;
&#13;
 q All of Phnom Penh's inner city and 60 percent of its suburbs today received metered&#13;
&#13;
      piped water.&#13;

            Fifteenth meeting of the Urban Think Tank
            on the 24-hour water supply : is this goal achievable?
            Drawing lessons from rapid distribution system diagnostic
            assessments in Indian cities
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            From water-rich cities such as Guwahati
            and Delhi, to water scarce towns in Rajasthan and Madhya
            Pradesh, the possibility of 24-hour access to piped water
            remains a mere dream for urban households in India. The
            concept of 24-hour water supply, seven days a week (24/7),
            year round, has become so alien to our mindset, that even
            new supply systems are designed for less than a continuous
            supply. This increases the size of supply infrastructure,
            pushes higher coping costs on to consumers and is
            dissatisfying for both consumers and system operators. The
            benefits of continuous water supply are well-documented.
            However, much work is needed to understand the costs, and
            the operating, management, and behavioral changes, to
            transition successfully to a 24/7 supply system. At the
            request of the Government of India's Ministry of Urban
            Development (MoUD), and with funding from Sweden's
            International Development Agency (SIDA), the Water and
            Sanitation Program-South Asia (WSP-SA) initiated a program
            to assess what it would take to move to a 24/7 water supply
            system. Through rapid technical assessments, draft
            strategies were developed for Guwahati (Assam), Indore
            (Madhya Pradesh), and the Delhi metropolitan area. In
            parallel, the Government of Karnataka and the World Bank
            carried out distribution system diagnostics in three cities
            in: Karnataka, Belgaum, Gulbarga, and Hubli-Dharwad. Results
            of these studies were discussed in a national workshop
            organized by the Change Management Forum and WSP-SA in
            Hyderabad in September 2003.
