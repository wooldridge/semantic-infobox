New Designs for Water and Sanitation Transactions&#13;
Preface&#13;
The Paris Seminar&#13;
Over the past few years the Water and Sanitation Program (along with a number of other specialist&#13;
water sector agencies) has been increasingly engaged in the design of private sector transactions because&#13;
of their potential to impact, positively or negatively, on the lives of the poor. As part of this effort the&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program, with financial support from the Public-P'rivate Infrastructure Advisory&#13;
Facility (PPIAF), held an international seminar in Paris in December 2000. The seminar aimed to enhance&#13;
the capacity of both economic and transactions aclvisers (building on their legal, regulatory ancl contract&#13;
perspective) ancd water and sanitation professionals (building on their poverty reduction perspective) to&#13;
develop new designs for water and sanitation transactions.&#13;
This seminar was part of an on-going set of initiatives relating to private sector pairticipation and the&#13;
poor in the infrastruLcture sectors, A previous conference in London in May 2000 (InfrastructuLre for&#13;
Development: Private Solutions and the Poor) hacd raised the issues which were cliscussecl in depth at&#13;
the Paris seminar.&#13;
The objectives of the seminar were to:&#13;
* build capacity of economic and transaction advisers to understand the reality facing poor consumilers&#13;
of water and sanitation services, and the necessity to explicitly acddress their neecls in contracts,&#13;
regulatory and legal instruments;&#13;
* build capacity of water and sanitation professionals working on poverty to understand the potential&#13;
of the various private sector participation instruments to structure outcomes; and,&#13;
* utilize the combined expertise of the two groups to generate new models for addressing the needs&#13;
of poor consumers in private sector participation instruments.&#13;
Structure of this Document&#13;
This document contains a synthesis of the work done at the seminar, along with additional material that&#13;
was developed by the participants subsequently. Rather than present a fornal proceedings' the auth1or s&#13;
have aimed to develop a practical structurecl CdocuLment, drawing on the debates at the seminar,&#13;
supplemented by additional material. The intention of this document is to provide gul(lance specifically&#13;
for those commissioning and executing technical assistance to governments interested in exploring the&#13;
potential for reform involving the private sector. (The target audience, therefore, includces transaction&#13;
advisers including lawyers, economic reform advisers and water and sanitation sector professionals.)&#13;
The document assumes a fairly high level of knowledge of the general issues relating to private sector&#13;
participation in infrastructure provision and focuses specifically on what might be needed to ensure that&#13;
transactions deliver benefits to poor consumers (both present and futuLre) as well as the better-off.&#13;
Obviously this is a complex and highly technical subject; as the document has been developed the&#13;
authors have striven to balance detail with clarity and maintain a degree of general applicability in the&#13;
arguments that have been developed. For more specific information on the cases and arguments the&#13;
authors have provided further references.&#13;
This document does not contain a blue-print or off-the-shelf solution for would-be reforners, rather&#13;
it provides some principles and guidelines which could be used as a cross-check to ensure that the&#13;
transaction designers deal with the poor explicitly and sympathetically in each individual case. Neither&#13;
does the document seek to advocate the involvement of private sector players; the intention is rather to&#13;
show interested readers that the poor can benefit if the realities of their situation are understood and&#13;
explicitly addressed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
New Designs for Water and Sanitation Transactions&#13;
The document is divided into six chapters and annexures:&#13;
1. Significance of Poverty,in Transaction Design - what is the extent and nature of urban poverty&#13;
in developing countries, and what is the nature of the water supply and sanitation market among&#13;
poor consumers?&#13;
2. Elements of Urban Water Sector Reform - what are we trying to achieve through sector reform,&#13;
and what tools are at our disposal?&#13;
3. Legal and Policy Frameworks - what is the legal and regulatory framework in which water supply&#13;
and sanitation services are delivered, and what are their relevance to the issue of serving the poor?&#13;
What can we learn by comparing the legal frameworks of France to those of England and Wales?&#13;
4. Making the Contract Work for the Poor - what are the different contract types, and what is the&#13;
relevance of contract type when it comes to serving the poor? How can we contract specifically for&#13;
such things as increased number of connections, innovative and appropriate levels of service, and&#13;
the use of alternative providers?&#13;
5. Tariff and Subsidy Design - what types of tariff structure exist, and how are water supply and&#13;
sanitation subsidies delivered? How can we effectively deliver subsidies to the poor?&#13;
6. Timing It All Right: Information Collection and Consultation - what needs to be done to ensure&#13;
that vital information on the poor is available in a timely way? How can meaningful consultation be&#13;
included in the transaction process?&#13;
7. Annex&#13;
A Word about Sanitation&#13;
Increasing access to improved sanitation for poor families, particularly in urban areas, is a crucial part&#13;
of the development process. Sanitation is often a neglected area when compared to the water sector,&#13;
with levels of investment and coverage lagging far behind (percentage coverage for sanitation has&#13;
actually fallen in Africa over the past ten years).&#13;
For these reasons the work described here initially set out to examine both water supply and&#13;
sanitation issues. However, sanitation differs in certain fundamental ways from water supply:&#13;
* firstly, it is even less likely than water to be a networked or utility service. While sewered sanitation&#13;
is the norm in most developed countries, on-site sanitation (pit latrines, septic tanks etc) are often&#13;
more appropriate and feasible;&#13;
* secondly, in situations of extreme poverty, demand for sanitation lags behind demand for water&#13;
supply and funds for sanitation do not form part of household budgets. Experience shows that&#13;
creating informed demand for sanitation requires long term investments of resources;&#13;
* thirdly, sanitation with full treatment is expensive and many sector professionals agree that high&#13;
levels of subsidy are probably required in sanitation (and indeed most developed countries subsidize&#13;
the subsector). It is difficult to achieve economic viability in the subsector; and,&#13;
* finally, sanitation is often a municipal function, and reforming service delivery is linked to a wider&#13;
process of municipal reform.&#13;
Because of these technical challenges, the latent nature of demand and its institutional complexity,&#13;
sanitation has often been omitted from private sector transactions. Where it is included it is almost&#13;
always in the form of requirements to expand sewered sanitation (La Paz/ El Alto being a high profile&#13;
example). Once neworked or sewered sanitation has been defined as the objective most of the issues&#13;
of transaction design become common to both water and sanitation. However, the inclusion of sanitation&#13;
does introduce more challenging policy and legal issues and may introduce the need for additional&#13;
institutional reform upfront (establishing, for example, appropriate roles for local government vis a vis&#13;
a private operator and other state entities responsible for oversight of a contract). Many governments&#13;
decide to omit sanitation from private sector transactions either because they feel the subsector is not&#13;
suitable for such a reform, because they feel that local and decentralized technical solutions are more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
New Designs for Water and Sanitation Transactions&#13;
suitable, because they are concerned (probably with some justification) that the sector will not be&#13;
attractive to the private sector, or because "getting water right" is seen as an over-riding policy objective&#13;
which must not be jeopardized by the addition of more institutional challenges&#13;
Many of the ideas presented here are relevant to sanitation; small-scale providers are key players in&#13;
many cities in sanitation as in water. The arguments presented for placing emphasis on expansion,&#13;
promoting appropriate levels of service, allowing multiple-service providers, adopting appropriate&#13;
technical standards, engaging in meaningful consultation and so on, are equally applicable to sanitation&#13;
as for water. Clearly there is a need for further specific thinking about sanitation, and also a need to&#13;
ensure that governments, when embarking on reform, make a conscious effort to decide how sanitation&#13;
will be dealt with and whether it is appropriate to use the same reform instrument for sanitation as for&#13;
water or whether alternative approaches will be needed to ensure that vital investments are macle ancl&#13;
services improved.&#13;

Box 4.1&#13;
The C6te d'Ivoire lease&#13;
In 1988, the government of C6te d'lvoire signed a contract with SODECI to operate the urban&#13;
water supply and sanitation system for a period of 20 years. SODECI is a private sector enterprise&#13;
which had been responsible for operation and maintenance of all urban water systems since&#13;
1971. The French company Saur owned 46 percent of the shares of SODECI, with Ivoirien investors&#13;
and the government holding the remaining 54 percent.&#13;
The nature of the contract is such that SODECI's revenues come directly from tariff collections,&#13;
so there is an incentive to add and serve new customers. In addition, there is provision for&#13;
making funds available to the operator for the installation of subsidized 'social connections' for&#13;
poor households that meet certain criteria. The operator has installed more than 300,000 new&#13;
connections since the signing of the contract, of which about 90 percent are social connections.&#13;
SODECI controls investment but, as the company does not provide the financing, it does not&#13;
bear any investment risk. The contract allows small investments such as new connections to be&#13;
carried out without tendering, so these can be undertaken by SODECI itself, which provides&#13;
another source of revenue for the company; there are concerns that this provides a perverse&#13;
incentive for over-investment.&#13;
Box 4.2&#13;
The Gabon water and electricity concession&#13;
Gabon is a small country of just over one million people, and is highly urbanized with half of the&#13;
population living in three major urban agglomerations. Production and distribution of water and&#13;
electricity was the responsibility of Societe d'Eau et d'Electricite du Gabon, which was forned in&#13;
1963, shortly after Gabon's independence. While overall performance of the utility was good, by&#13;
1996 it was practically bankrupt, and had ceased investment. Coverage rates had stagnated at 40&#13;
percent for water and 66 percent for electricity.&#13;
The government of Gabon decided to invite the private sector to operate the utility on a&#13;
concession basis, with the objectives of increasing coverage, improving service quality, eliminating&#13;
the need for public financing and maintaining affordable tariffs. IFC, chosen as transaction advisor,&#13;
carried out strategic analysis, the development of a financial model, legal analysis, contract&#13;
preparation and preparation of bidding documentation. The competitive bidding was based on a&#13;
technical offer demonstrating the bidder's understanding of the situation and approach to developing&#13;
the sector according to specified perfornance targets, and a financial offer consisting of a reduction in&#13;
tariffs. In 1997 a 20 year concession was awarded to Geinrale des Eaux, a French company, part of&#13;
the Vivendi Group, for their winning bid of a 17.25 percent reduction in tariffs.&#13;
The contract specified 5-year coverage targets broken down into five geographic areas, the&#13;
development of 30 new isolated centers, and quality standards for both water supply and electricity&#13;
(water quality, power supply characteristics, continuity of service etc.) with penalties for failure to&#13;
achieve them. In the case of the coverage targets, the penalties were equal to 25 percent of any&#13;
'missing' investments in expansion, based on an independent survey undertaken every 5 years.&#13;
The basic tariff level proposed by the bidder was to be retained through the duration of the&#13;
contract, with a quarterly revision mechanism based on the cost of inputs. The water tariff the&#13;
operator is allowed to charge is subject to a 'productivity improvement coefficient', which means&#13;
tariffs will not increase in direct proportion to costs, so the operator must improve efficiency to&#13;
close the gap.&#13;

The total investment for the duration of the contract is in the order of US$200 million for asset&#13;
renewal and US$400 for expansion. As early as the second year after the concession was awarded,&#13;
the utility was profitable, and financial results have continued to be positive. The customer base&#13;
for water supply increased by 50 percent between 1996 and 2000, from 48,000 to 72,565 customers.&#13;
Water quality has increased substantially, and tariffs are still lower than the pre-private sector&#13;
participation levels.&#13;

The Johannesburg management contract&#13;
In the late 1990s the city of Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city with a population of some&#13;
3.8 million, was facing serious financial difficulties. It had arrears of over two billion Rand and&#13;
was struggling to maintain the delivery of existing services, let alone undertake the urgently&#13;
needed expansion to previously marginalized communities.&#13;
The city responded to the situation with a bold plan which included the restructuring of the&#13;
city by breaking out previously municipally-provided services into a range of utilities, agencies,&#13;
corporatized entities and divestitures. The water and sanitation utility was the largest of the three&#13;
utilities established under the reform program. It had a healthy cash flow and would, potentially,&#13;
have been a candidate for a long term concession. Due to public opposition to private sector&#13;
participation, the municipal government opted instead to introduce a management contract as a&#13;
first step in the reform process.&#13;
The contract has two incentive components. The first is a bonus payable, annually, on&#13;
achievement of defined performance goals. The bonus is measured against achievement in five&#13;
areas identified as important for the improvement of the utility's overall performance. The&#13;
performance achieved is graded against the improvement specified in the contract and a formula&#13;
is used to determine what proportion of the sum allocated for the bonus is to be paid to the&#13;
management contractor. The second is an incentive payment made as a percentage of the&#13;
improvement in operating margin achieved by the management contractor in each year. In line&#13;
with evolving international practice the payment of the incentives is made after an independent&#13;
assessment of utility performance by a reputable international firm.&#13;
The percentage used to calculate the second incentive payment was the basis by which the&#13;
winning bidder was selected. The bid process specified a fixed payment to be made to the&#13;
operator. The amount was less than the costs expected to be incurred in performing their duties&#13;
of the management contractor. In order to bridge the funding gap the bidders were expected to&#13;
make an assessment of the extent by which they would improve the defined operating margin.&#13;
They would then use this information to derive the percentage value they would bid. In theory&#13;
the bidder that was expecting to make the largest increases in revenue and reductions in cost&#13;
would be able to bid the lowest percentage value and thereby win the competition. In addition,&#13;
it was expected that there would be a strong incentive for the bidder to continue to maximize&#13;
improvements in operating margins (and hence their incentive payment) - to the joint benefit&#13;
of both the utility and the management contractor.&#13;
It is not yet clear if the bidding approach developed for the contract will be successful. The&#13;
winning bid offered a very low percentage, which, while looking good for the utility (because a&#13;
greater proportion of the increased operating margin is passed to the utility rather than to the&#13;
operator through the incentive payment), also reduces the incentive to the operator because&#13;
there is less return to them on each unit of increased operating margin.                    33&#13;

Examples of the ways in which contracts have impacted the poor&#13;
Manila, Philippines concession: In Manila, the two concessionaires are encouraged to use&#13;
innovative technology and third-party provision by contracts which do not contain strict standards&#13;
for what constitutes a connection, do not disallow third-party provision and allow the concessionaire&#13;
to add households served through means other than conventional utility connections to be added&#13;
to the 'covered' population for the calculation of compliance with coverage targets. Responding to&#13;
the need for alternatives for reaching the poor, one of the concessionaires has developed a system&#13;
known as Bayan Tubig ('Water for the Community'), for water delivery in densely-populated,&#13;
hard-to-reach slum areas. An underground water line carries water service to the perimeter of a&#13;
slum neighborhood, and is then extended above ground - partially covered, attached to a wall,&#13;
or lying on the surface. The line connects to a battery of meters from where each homeowner&#13;
makes their own plastic connection, using small diameter pipes running from the main to households&#13;
on the surface or along walls. Maintenance responsibility for the plastic pipes lies with the customers.&#13;
Community-based organizations and NGOs play a role in intermediation and mapping of the&#13;
network. Estimates suggest that the Bayan-Tubig connections have reduced water connection&#13;
costs for poor families by up to 25 percent. As even these reduced costs are sometimes a challenge,&#13;
the concessionaire has also introduced interest-free repayment schemes over 6 to 24 month periods.&#13;
Introduced in early 1999, the program had provided water connections to 19,000 poor households&#13;
by the end of that year, and as of 2001 the figure had risen to over 50,000. The other concessionaire&#13;
was equally unconventional in serving the poor, arranging to sell bulk water to a steel tank&#13;
manufacturing company which then installed small networks to serve poor communities36.&#13;

to the poor. The central mechanism for serving the poor is a social tariff, coupled with the 'social&#13;
connection', which is a fully subsidized connection provided to households that meet certain criteria&#13;
set by the relevant government ministry. The criteria are that the connection is small diameter (less&#13;
than 15mm), that there are less than 4 water delivery points in the dwelling, and that the connection&#13;
is not to be used for commercial purposes, nor is part of a commercial housing estate. Under these&#13;
criteria, about 90 percent of the 300,000 connections installed since 1988 were social connections.&#13;
The social connections are financed by a charge, in addition to the water tariff, which the operator&#13;
is obliged by the contract to collect from water customers. The amounts collected are deposited in&#13;
a separate bank account, and five-year plans are prepared by the operator for disbursement of the&#13;
funds. Approximately 10 million CFA has been collected and spent on social connections through&#13;
this mechanism.&#13;
An amount is assigned that the operator can charge as his remuneration for each new connection;&#13;
this amount allows the operator a profit, and thus there is an incentive to install new connections.&#13;
There is no disincentive to serve customers with social connections as, due to the way the contract&#13;
is structured, the operator is paid the same amount regardless of the type of connection.&#13;
The shortcoming of this system is the fact that the operator can only install connections in legal&#13;
settlements. As an estimated 70 percent of the unserved population is non-Ivoirien, and living in&#13;
illegal settlements, they cannot benefit from the social connection policy. Another obstacle to&#13;
serving the poor was the institution of quarterly billing by the operator. The poor could not meet&#13;
the requirements of such infrequent billing, and many were disconnected. Since this, time billing&#13;
centers and schemes to pay off arrears have been established, and the situation has improved.&#13;
A similar program of social connectionis was used in the Senegal affermage contract, signed in&#13;
1996 between a state holding company and Senegalaise des Eaux. In this case, the requirement to&#13;
collect the funds for the social connections was not in the contract, as they were funded by donors,&#13;
but the incentives were similar (the operator was allowed a certain fee for a new installation and&#13;
there was no disincentive to serve households with social connections).&#13;
Tucunian, Argentina concession: Aggressive investment targets were set in the contract. These had&#13;
an impact on prices, which had to rise. Low income households then found affordability to be an issue.&#13;
Buenos Aires, Argentina concession: In May 1993, a 30-year concession contract was awarded&#13;
to a private company to operate the water and sewerage services in Buenos Aires. Those consumers&#13;
who were already connected to the system initially benefited from a significant drop in tariffs and&#13;
an improvement in the quality and reliability of service. Expansion targets set by geographical&#13;
area, with poor areas prioritized, resulted in large numbers of new households being connected.&#13;
However, an unpopular decision to pass the cost of system expansion on to new consumers in the&#13;
form of a hefty 'infrastructure charge' was one of the issues leading to public unrest and early contract&#13;
renegotiation. This very high connection charge, unaffordable for the poor, was replaced by a bimonthly&#13;
'Universal Service and Environmental Improvement' fee (SUMA), which was levied on all customers&#13;
regardless of when they connected to the network. Connection charges were reduced to US$ 120 for&#13;
water or sanitation; repayable over five-years in interest-free installments averaging US$ 4 per month.&#13;
Despite the fact that the changes resulted in a decrease in average bills in poor areas of 74 percent, from&#13;
US$61 to US$16, it is debatable whether even at this level the rates are affordable for the poor. In&#13;
addition, the renegotiation saw the reduction in some of the targets for expansion, which is detrimental&#13;
to the poor who are the primary residents of the unserved areas"7.&#13;

42 Economists clefine the term "marginal cost" as the change in the cost of providing a good or service if one more unit of&#13;
output is produced. The term short-run marginal cost" means the incremental change in the cost of providing a good&#13;
over a "short time horizon' for an incremental change in output. Over a short time period some costs are not escapahle;&#13;
such costs are thus not part of the "short ruin marginal costs" over this planning horizon From an economic perspective,&#13;
the only costs that are relevant to decisions are those that are escapable.&#13;

* Examine existing service quality and environmental standards: their clarity, financial and technical feasibility, enforceability, criteria for&#13;
relaxing or gradually phasing in standards, etc.&#13;
* Determine whether ambitious or unrealistic ser-vice quality and environmental standards create barriers to serving the poor&#13;
* Evaluate tariffs and the financial viability of services&#13;
a Evaluate the effecti-veness qf the current tariff structure and subsidies and determine whether they benefit the poor&#13;
a Evaluate the impact of current and proposed taiff structures on the financial viability of services and the incentives of a private&#13;
operator to serve the poor&#13;

Many other researchers are working on the issue of making urban sector reform and private sector&#13;
participation benefit the poor. Some of the other initiatives which have come to the authors' attention&#13;
are listed below. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, and there may be many others working on&#13;
related issues which have, inadvertently, not been mentioned here.&#13;

The ADB recently developed a Terms of Reference for a Regional Technical Assistance Project&#13;
which is scheduled to start in April 2002. This Technical Assistance, entitled "Water in Cities" is part&#13;
of ADB's contribution to the WWF and it will involve two studies. One them is a survey of small&#13;
scale private water providers to the urban poor. The study proposes undertaking research in nine&#13;
cities (Manila, Cebu, Delhi, Dhaka, Shanghai, Kathmandu, Ho Chi Min, Ulan Bataar and Jakarta).&#13;
The case studies are expected to be complete by September 2002.&#13;

            New designs for water and sanitation
            transactions - making private sector participation work for
            the poor
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The document is a practical, structured
            document that draws on the debates from the International
            Seminar on Water and Sanitation, held in Paris, France on
            December 2000, supplemented by additional material. The
            first chapter reviews the significance of poverty in
            transaction design, namely the extent and nature of urban
            poverty in developing countries, and on the nature of the
            water supply and sanitation market among poor consumers.
            Elements of urban water sector reform are explored in
            Chapter two, while Chapter three examines the legal and
            policy frameworks as it relates to water supply and
            sanitation services delivery, their relevance to the issue
            of serving the poor, and, provides lessons of experience by
            comparing the legal frameworks of France to those of England
            and Wales. The different contract types, and their relevance
            when it comes to serving the poor is addressed in Chapter
            four, featuring ways to contract specifically for issues
            such as increased number of connections, innovative and
            appropriate levels of service, and the use of alternative
            providers. The fifth chapter reviews the types of tariff
            structures, and the delivery of water supply and sanitation
            subsidies, to explore effective ways to deliver subsidies to
            the poor. Chapter six offers some recommendations on
            information data collection to evaluate alternatives in
            accessing services by the poor, and how can meaningful
            consultation be included in the transaction process.
