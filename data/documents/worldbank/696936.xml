            The Macedonian gambit - enterprise cum bank restructuring
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The former Yugoslav Republic of
            Macedonia, supported by a World Bank policy-based loan, is
            trying a new approach to reform its enterprises. Enterprises
            will still be privatized as soon as possible, but the
            government frankly acknowledges that a few enterprises have
            considerable clout and must be subsidized for political, not
            economic reasons. These politically powerful enterprises are
            isolated from vulnerable banks, but given a direct subsidy
            in exchange for undertaking monitorable reforms. In exchange
            for the subsidies, the politically powerful enterprises have
            to end value-subtracting activities, break off their
            relations with banks, and immediately take steps to
            liquidate or privatize constituent units at a pace
            determined by the cabinet, where political tradeoffs are
            best made. Freezing the debts of the political enterprises
            frees banks from the pressure to make more bad loans. So far
            this isolation technique shows signs of success, and it
            could usefully be adapted by other transforming economies.
