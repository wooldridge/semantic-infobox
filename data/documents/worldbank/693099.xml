Lessons&#13;
Size and structure&#13;
Several important lessons emerge from IFC's&#13;
experience.                                The structure of a fund helps define the incen-&#13;
tives for managers to perform and for fund&#13;
Management                                 shareholders to remain interested-but not to&#13;
interfere too much. The size of funds has been&#13;
The quality of fund management is the most   one important factor. Funds under US$10 mil-&#13;

Establishing a regional management company   single-tier funds, in which the fund and fund&#13;
and fund to provide international manage-   manager are incorporated in one entity, per-&#13;

            Venture capital funds pool and manage
            money from investors seeking private equity stakes in small
            and medium-size enterprises with strong growth potential.
            These investments tend to be long term, and the industry is
            relatively new in emerging markets. So only very recently
            has it been possible to draw some conclusions about the
            performance of these funds. The authors outline some of the
            lessons from IFC's portfolio.
