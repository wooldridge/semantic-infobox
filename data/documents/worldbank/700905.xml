A Background Study for World Development Report, 1979&#13;
This paper reviews recent changes in trade in manufactured goods&#13;
between developed and developing countries and examines the employment&#13;
effects of this trade for the former group of countries.  rt is shown that&#13;
the developing countries have assumed increased importance as markets&#13;
for developed country exporters and that these trends are expected to&#13;
continue in the future. At the same time, the net employment effects&#13;
of the projected expansion of trade for the developed countries would&#13;
be practically nil and employment changes in their import-competing -&#13;
industries would be small as compared to total employment in those industries.&#13;
Simultaneously, the developed countries would derive benefits through a shift&#13;
from low-skill to high-skill occupations, the exchange of physical and human&#13;
capital for unskilled labor, and technological change.&#13;

THE CHANGING INTE'NTATIONAL DIVISION OF tLAOR&#13;
IN MANUFACTURED GOODS&#13;
Bela Balassa&#13;
Introduction&#13;
This paper will examine the changing pattern of the international&#13;
division of labor in manufActured goods between developed and developing&#13;
countries. It will consider recent and prospective changes in trade flows&#13;
between the two groups of countries and analyse the employment implications&#13;
of these flows for the developed countries.&#13;
Section I of the paper will describe changes in trade in manufactures&#13;
between developed and developing countries following the oil crisis of 1973.&#13;
The employment effects of this trade for the developed countries will be&#13;
aaalysed in Section II, with further consideration given to the skill-composi-&#13;
tion of employment. Information will also be provided on the physical and the&#13;
1uman capital intensity of the manufactured exports and imports of the developed&#13;
countries in trade with the developing countries.&#13;
Section III will consider possible future changes in manufactured&#13;
trade between the developed and the developing countries and indicate the&#13;
employment implications of the projected trade flows. In so doing, distinction&#13;
will again be made among skill classes. Finally, the policy implications of the&#13;
findings will be discussed.&#13;
I. Recent Trends in Trade in Manufactured Goods between the Developed&#13;
Industrial and the Developing Countries 1/&#13;
The Time Pattern of Trade&#13;
In popular discussions, as well as in international fora, much atten-&#13;
tion has been given in recent years to the growth of the manufactured imports&#13;
1/ Statistical work for this section of the paper. was done by Michel Nodl.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
of the developed countries from the developing countries.  rn particular,&#13;
questions have been raised concerning the effects of increased imports on&#13;
output and employment in the former group of countries.&#13;
'Changes in the imports of the developed countries from the develop-&#13;
ing countries cannot, however, be considered independently from changes in&#13;
their exports to them. Correspondingly, in the following, we will examine&#13;
the time pattern of manufactured exports and imports in trade between developed&#13;
and developing countries. This will be done for the period 1973-77, further&#13;
disaggregating the results according to major country and industry groups.&#13;
Unless otherwise noted, all data have been expressed in current U.S. dollars.&#13;
Use has been made of data reported by the developed industrial&#13;
countries (for short, the industrial countries), including the United States,&#13;
Canada, the European Common Market, the European Free Trade Association, and&#13;
Japan. In turn, among tha developing countries, distinction has been made&#13;
between oil-exporting and oil-importing countries. Australia, New Zealand, and&#13;
South Africa, the countries of Southern Europe, and the Communist countries&#13;
have not been included in either grouping.&#13;
Tables 1 and 2 provide annual data for the period 1973-77 on trade&#13;
between industrial and developing countries in manufactured goods (defined as&#13;
commodity classes 5 to 8 in the U.N. Standard Industrial Classification less&#13;
68 nonferrous metals) in a geographical and in an industry breakdown, respec-&#13;
tively. Within the manufacturing category, distinction has been made among&#13;
the following commodity groups: Nonelectrical and electrical machinery and&#13;
transport equipment; chemicals, iron and steel; textiles; clothing; and&#13;
consumer goods other than clothing and their intermediate inputs.  The latter&#13;
category includes leather and leather products, rubber products, wood and&#13;

Little needs to be said of the industrial countries' trade in&#13;
manufactured goods with the oil-exporting developing countries. The latter&#13;
group of countries export few manufactured goods while their imports have been&#13;
rising rapidly since the quadrupling of oil prices in late 1973. As a result,&#13;
the industrial countries increased their exports of manufactured goods to the&#13;
oil-exporting developing countries from $12.9 billion in 1973 to $55.5 billion&#13;
in 1977.&#13;
Several phases may be distinguished in regard to trade in manufactures&#13;
becween the industrial countries and the oil-importing developing countries. In&#13;
Lhe years of the world recession, 1974 and 1975, the industrial countries'&#13;
Lmports of manufactured goods from the developing countries increased by&#13;
27 percent. Adjusting for price increases of 31 percent,-/ the volume of&#13;
these imports declined by 3 percent between 1973 and 1975. In the same period,&#13;
the manufactured esports of the industrial countries to the. oil-importing&#13;
dleveloping countries rose by 59 percent,representing price increases of&#13;
37 percent and a volume increase of 16 percent.&#13;
These changes in trade flows led to an increase in the export&#13;
surplus of the industrial countries in their manufactured trade with the&#13;
oil-importing developing countries from $23.9 billion in 1973 to. $42.9 billion&#13;
1/ The unit value indices used in deflating the current dollar value of the&#13;
manufactured exports of the developing countries have been derived from&#13;
data published in GATT, Netdorks of WorZd Trade by Areas and Co=modity&#13;
cLasses, 1955-1976, Geneva, 1978. The corresponding data for the developed&#13;
countries are published in United Nations, MonthZy BulZetin of Statistics,&#13;

in 1975. The United States accounted for two-thirds of the rise in tL:e&#13;
surplus, with an export increase of 71.5 percent as against average incr2ases&#13;
of 54.2 percent for the other industrial countries, reflecting largely an&#13;
improvement of the U.S. competitive position following the devaluation of&#13;
the dollar.&#13;
The described developments were associated with the continued growth&#13;
of the national economies of oil-importing developing countries in the mid3v&#13;
of the world recession. The combined GDP of these countries increased ,&#13;
9.7 percent between 1973 and 1975 while the 1975 CDP of the industrial&#13;
countries barely reached the 1973 level.&#13;
The oil-importing developing countries financed the expansion of&#13;
their manufactured imports by drawing down foreign exchange reserves and&#13;
borrowing in international financial markets. In a recessionary sftuation,&#13;
the increased imports of these countries benefited the industrial countries&#13;
through a multiplicative effect on their domestic incomes.&#13;
The situation changed in 1976 when renewed economic expansicn on&#13;
the industrial countries gave impetus to their imports of manufacturt-.d *-lod-&#13;
from the oil-importing developing countries. At the same time, tht- 19 per ent&#13;
increase in the volume of these imports, derived by adjusting the 3-9 reret&#13;
increase in import value for an average price increase of 8 percent, exceede.2&#13;
the 5.3 percent rise in the combined GDP of the industrial countriezi tx A&#13;
considerable margin. This result reflects in p.rt the highi marginal propen-&#13;
sity to import in the developed countries and in part the export prcmot.-n&#13;
efforts of several developing countries, in particular, Korea and T.iiw.)n,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7.&#13;
In turn, the value of the manufactured exports of the industrial&#13;
countries to the oil-iaporting developing countries rose by only 3 percent,&#13;
with export prices remaining at the 1975 level. Within this total, the&#13;
exports of iron and steel and chemicals declined by 8 percent while other&#13;
commodity groups showed increases of 7 to 8 percent. * These developments may&#13;
be explained by a slowdown in the economic growth in some of the oil-importing&#13;
developing countries and in the efforts made to improve their balance-of-&#13;
payments position, in particular through import substitution in steel.&#13;
The described changes in trade flows led to a decline in the net&#13;
export balance of the industrial countries in their manufactured trade with&#13;
the oil-importing developing countries from $42.9 billion in 1975 to $37.2&#13;
billion in 1976. The brunt of the decline was borne by the United States,&#13;
whose competitive position deteriorated at the time. The export surpluses of&#13;
European countries decreased to a lesser extent while Japan experienced a&#13;
small increase in its surplus.&#13;
Predictions made as to the continuation of this trend proved&#13;
erroneous, however, and the industrial countries' export surplus in&#13;
manufactures traded with the oil-importing developing countries increased&#13;
again the following year. As a result, the trade balance in manufactured goods&#13;
between the two groups of countries returned to approximately the 1975 level,&#13;
exceeding the level reached in 1973 by more than three-fourths.&#13;
The improvement in the industrial countries' trade balance in&#13;
manufactured goods with the oil-importing developing countries between 1976&#13;
and 1977 reflects a deceleration in the growth of their imports and an&#13;
acceleration in the rise of their exports. The rates of increase were 19&#13;
percent and 16 percent, respectively, when the average prices of manufactured&#13;
goods in world trade increased by 9 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
The slowdown in the imports of the industrial countries was&#13;
concentrated in Japan, whose manifactured imports from the oil-importing&#13;
developing countries rose by only 3 percent in 1977, as well as in Canada,&#13;
whose imports fell in absolute terms. In both cases, a decline in the rate&#13;
of economic growth and continued protection against developing country&#13;
products contributed to the outcome. Despite increased protection of textiles&#13;
and clothing and a deceleration of economic growth, U.S. and European imports&#13;
of manufactured goods from the non-oil producing developing countries rose&#13;
by more than one-fifth between 1976 and 1977.&#13;
With a continued deterioration in its competitive position, however,&#13;
U.S. exports of manufactured goods to the oil-importing developing countries&#13;
increased by only 3 percent. As a result, the manufactured trade surplus&#13;
of the United States with these countries declined further, from $5.3 billion&#13;
in 1976 to $3.2 billion in 1977. In turn, slow increases in imports,&#13;
accompanied by a one-fourth rise in exports, led to an increase in Japan's&#13;
trade surplus in manufactured goods with the oil-importing developing&#13;
countries from $13.2 billion in 1976 to $17.2 billion in 1977. In the same&#13;
period, the trade surpluses of the European countries with the oil-importing&#13;
developing countries increased by about one-sixth.&#13;
Among individual product groups, the slowdown in the industrial&#13;
countries' imports was the most pronounced in textiles and clothing, with&#13;
increases of 8 and 10 percent, respectively, reflecting in part a consolidation&#13;
after the unsustainable increase of about 40 percent in 1976 and in part the&#13;
effects of protectionist measures taken. By contrast, the imports of&#13;
nonelectrical and electrical machinery and transport equipment, and of consumer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
goods other than textiles and their intermediate imports, increased by about&#13;
one-fourth and impozts of iron and stee:L and chemicals by onLe-sixth.&#13;
In the exports of the industrial countries to the non-oil importing&#13;
developing countries an increase by one-fourth occurred in consumer goods&#13;
other than textiles and their intermediate inputs. The exports of clothing&#13;
rose at a somewhat faster (31 percent), and textile exports at a somewhat&#13;
slower (18 percent), rate. Finally, the exports of nonelectrical and electrical&#13;
machinery and transport equipment and of iron and steel and chemicals increased&#13;
by 15 and 13 percent respectively.&#13;
The Changing Position of Individual Countries and Country Groups&#13;
For the 1973-77 period as a whole, the manufactured trade surplus&#13;
of the industrial countries with the oil-exporting developing countries&#13;
increased nearly four-and-a-half times, from $12.3 billion in 1973 to $54.6&#13;
billion in 1977. There were relatively small variations in percentage&#13;
increases of the export surplus among the industrial countries, with&#13;
Canada (394 percent) at the upper, and the EEC countries (337 percent) at the&#13;
lower end of the range.&#13;
In turn, the manufactured trade surplus of the industrial countries&#13;
with the oil-importing developing countries rose from $23.9 billion in 1973&#13;
to $42.2 billion in 1977, with substantial variations shown among the major&#13;
industrial countries and country groups. The U.S. surplus increased from&#13;
$3.0 billion in 1973 to $3.2 billion in 1975, with practically no change in&#13;
Canada, increases in the surpluses of the EEC and the EFTA countries from&#13;
$11.3 billion to $19.1 billion and from $1.8 billion to $2.8 billion,&#13;
respectively, and a rise from $7.7 billion to $17.2 billion in Japan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
The observed changes in net balance of the Common Market countries&#13;
and the United States in their manufactured trade with the oil-importing&#13;
developing countries are largely explained by reference to the initiai&#13;
situation in 1973.  The EEC countries increased their imports of manufactured&#13;
goods from the oil-importing developing countries (132 percent) more rapidiy&#13;
than the United States (113 percent) and experienced only a slightly larger&#13;
rise in their exports to these countries (87 percent as compared to 82 perce.L&#13;
in the U.S.). However, they benefited from the fact that their export-impoct&#13;
ratio in manufactured trade with the oil-importing developing countries was&#13;
3.4 in 1973 as compared to 1.4 in the United States.&#13;
Similar considerations apply in United States-EFTA relationsla!a.3&#13;
Thus, the imports of manufactured goods by the EFTA countries from the oli&#13;
importing developing countries rose more (141 percent) than imports into thi&#13;
United States, while their exports increased less (79 percent) than U.S.&#13;
exports. But, the EFTA countries had an export-import ratio of 3.4 in&#13;
manufactured trade with the oil-importing developing countries in 1973,&#13;
as the Common Market.&#13;
Differences in the initial situation, in turn, are largely expla...;ct!&#13;
by the more liberal import policy followed vis-a-vis the developing counii-eยฑS&#13;
by the United States, as compared to European councries, in the early seveu.&#13;
The contrast is even greater with Japan, whose export-import ratio in maii&#13;
factured trade with the oil-importing developing countries was 4.5 in 1973.&#13;
At the same time, Japan's imports from these countries rose by only 34 perct .&#13;
between 1973 and 1977, representing an absolute decline in volume terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
The protectionist policies followed by Tapan, together with the&#13;
greater similarity of its economic structure to that of the more advanced&#13;
developing countries, may account for these results. At the same time, the&#13;
102 percent rise in Japan's exports was aided by its increased competitiveness.&#13;
As a result, Japan's manufactured trade surplus with oil-importing developing&#13;
countries more than doubled between 1973 and 1977.&#13;
The Commodity Composition of Trade&#13;
The manufactured exports of the industrial countries to the oil-&#13;
exporting developing countries are increasingly dominated by nonelectrical&#13;
and electrical machinery and transport equipment, which accounted for 62.5&#13;
percent of the total in 1973 and for 72.3 percent in 1977. Other commodity&#13;
groups of.importance, with their 1977 share in parenthesis, are iron and steel&#13;
and chemicals (14.1 percent) and consumer goods other than clothing and their&#13;
intermediate inputs (9.5 percent).&#13;
Noneletrical and electrical machinery and transport equipment&#13;
also assumed increasing importance in the manufactured exports of the&#13;
industrial countries to oil-importing developing countries, with their share&#13;
in the total rising from 57.6 percent in 1973 to 61.7 percent in 1977. But,&#13;
the industrial countries' imports of these commodities increased even faster,&#13;
leading to a decline in their export-import ratio from 6.1 in 1973 to 5.0 in&#13;
1977.&#13;
The United States accounts for the lion's share of the imports&#13;
(62 percent in 1977) of nonelectrical and electrical machinery and transport&#13;
equipment from the oil-importing developing countries. Office and telecom-&#13;
munication equipment and household equipment each account for nearly one-third&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
of this total and the miscellaneous machinery and transport equipment category&#13;
(mainly ships) for slightly less.&#13;
As a result of the rapid rise of imports, the U.S. trade surplus&#13;
in nonelectrical and electrical machinery and transport equipment with the&#13;
oil-importing developing countries declined to $7.0 billion in 1977, after&#13;
having risen from $4.2 billion in 1973 to $8.8 billion in 1975. This contrasts&#13;
with an increase from $14.8 billion in 1973 to $29.8 in 1977 in the trade&#13;
surplus of the other industrial countries, taken together. The latter group&#13;
of countries experienced similar growth rates of exports and imports of&#13;
anoelectrical and electrical machinery and transport equipment as'the United&#13;
States, but started out with a much higher export-import ratio in 1973.&#13;
In iron and steel and in chemicals, the export surplus of the&#13;
industrial countries with the oil-importing developing countries reached the&#13;
highest point, $15.4 billion, in 1974; after declining to $14.2 billion in 1975&#13;
and to $12.5 billion in 1976, it rose again to $14.1 billion in 1977. These&#13;
results conceal different trends in iron and steel and in chemicals. While&#13;
the industrial countries experienced more-or-less continuous increases in&#13;
their export surplus in chemicals, the export surplus of these countries in&#13;
steel declined sharply after 1974, reflecting largely import substitution&#13;
in steel in the major oil-importing developing countries.&#13;
No clear trend is discernible in the industrial countries' trade&#13;
in textiles with the oil-importing developing countries, with small surpluses&#13;
shown in every year of the period under review. This contrasts with the&#13;
popular perception, according to which industrial country markets would have&#13;
been invaded by developing country products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13 -&#13;
The situation is different for clothing, where all industrial&#13;
countries experienced a rising deficit in their trade with oil-importing&#13;
developing countries. The deficit rose from $3.0 billion in 1973 to $7.1&#13;
billion in 1977, with the United States and the EEC each accounting for&#13;
about two-fifths of the total. Even Japan experienced a trade deficit in&#13;
clothing with the oil-importing developing countries.&#13;
Finally, from a deficit of $0.9 billion in 1973, the trade balance&#13;
of the industrial countries in cons-mer goods other than clothing and their&#13;
intermediate inputs temporarily turned into a small surplus in 1975 and again&#13;
showed a deficit ($1.9 billion) in 1977. This deficit is composed of a growing&#13;
deficit in consumer goods other than clothing and a small surplus in their&#13;
intermediate inputs.&#13;
Among the individual countries and country groups, Japan and EFTA&#13;
have experienced a rising surplus, the Comon Market a more-or-less continuous&#13;
decline in its surplus, and the United States a growing deficit, in trade with&#13;
the oil-importing developing countries in consumer goods other than clothing&#13;
and their intermediate inputs. At the same time, changes in the two commodity&#13;
subgroups that make up this category were about the same in each country and&#13;
country group.&#13;
II. The Employment Effects of Trade in Manufactures&#13;
between Developed and Develooing Countries 1/&#13;
The Available Evidence&#13;
We have considered so far changes in trade in manufactured goods&#13;
between the developed industrial and the developing countries. The next&#13;
question relates to the employment effects of this trade.  Wh,ile much of the&#13;
1/ The voluminous statistical work underlying the estimates of this section&#13;
was undertaken by Kishore Nadkarni.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
recent discussion has concentrated on the employment implications of increased&#13;
Imports by the developed countries from the developing countries, our concern&#13;
is with the employment effects of changes in exports and imports in trade&#13;
between the two groups of countries. In this connection, reference will first&#13;
be made to the findings of studies on the employment effects of multilateral&#13;
trade liberalization.&#13;
These studias have concluded that net changes in trade and employment&#13;
in the developed countries resulting from multilateral trade liberalization&#13;
would be negligible. Baldwin finds, for example, that -- for his preferred&#13;
set of elasticities - a 50 percent multilateral across-the-board tariff cut&#13;
in all commodities, excluding textiles in U.S. exports and imports, petroleum&#13;
in U.S. imports, and agricultural products in U.S. exports to the EEC, would&#13;
have practically no effect on the U.S. trade balance and would represent a&#13;
net employment loss of only 15 thousand in the United States (1976, p. 146).&#13;
Thus, "the main conclusion emerging from the study is that the United States&#13;
can participate in a substantial tariff-cutting negotiation without causing&#13;
significant adverse trade and employment effects in the country" (p. 148).&#13;
Baldwin's calculation refers to direct plus indirect cl-anges in&#13;
employment, the latter being derived by utilizing the 367 sector U.S. input-&#13;
output table for 1967. Cline et al. provide estimates of direct and indirect&#13;
employment effects for twelve alternative tariff-cutting formulas, all of&#13;
which exclude petroleum products and textiles.  Labor-input coefficients&#13;
have been available in a 92 sector breakdown in the United States, a 160 sector&#13;
breakdown for Japan, and a 10 to 30 sector breakdown for the Common Market&#13;
countries. For Canada, U.S. coefficients have been used (1973, p. 63).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Under formula (1), representing a 60 percent multilatercL ac4ros5&#13;
the-board tariff cut that approximately corresponds to the median of the&#13;
twelve alternative estimates, a net direct employment gain of 18.8 thousand&#13;
and a direct plus indirect employment gain of 28.9 thousand is shown fcr&#13;
the United States while the corresponding figures are -25.7 and -50.6 thousAnd&#13;
for Canada, 2.7 and 23.9 thousand in Japan, and -112.2 thousand (direct effecrs&#13;
only) for the EEC; in the latter case, it is estimated that total exports would4&#13;
decline as the decrease in intra-EEC trade would outweigh the increase in&#13;
extra-EEC exports (pp. 125-6). Correspondingly, Cline concludes that "those&#13;
who fear serious employment dislocation from liberalizing imports are without&#13;
empirical support" (p. 232).&#13;
.The results of these studies do not pemit one, however, to derive&#13;
conclusions as regards the employment effects of increased trade between&#13;
developed and developing countries, in part because the estimates include&#13;
trade among the developed countries that far outweighs trade between developed&#13;
and developing countries, and in part because textiles, an important export&#13;
product of the developing countries, has been excluded.-L/ In the following,&#13;
we will concentrate on the employment effects of trade in manufactured goods&#13;
between developed and developing countries.&#13;
In a paper entitled "Impact of LDC Exports on Employment in American&#13;
Industry," Anne Krueger has estimated the direct employment effects of changes&#13;
in the share of imports in domestic consumption and in the net trade balance&#13;
1/ Cline et al., however, also estimated the direct employment effects of&#13;
multilateral trade liberalization in textiles. These are -37 thousand&#13;
jobs in the United States, -6 in Canada, -17 in EEC, and -41 in Japan&#13;
(pp. 132-35).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
of the United States for the 1970-76 period in the two-digit breakdown of&#13;
the U.S. Standard Industrial Classification, encompassing 20 manufacturing&#13;
sectors. While additional estimates are provided on the employment effects&#13;
of imports in some four-digit categories where import competition has been&#13;
especially strong, the employment effects of imports from, and exports to,&#13;
the developing countries are not separately examined. Krueger thus relies&#13;
oa data on total imports in rejecting "the belief that the underlying cause&#13;
of the difficulties of industries seeking protection is competition from&#13;
abroad, especially from the LDCs" (1978, p. 2).&#13;
In turn, Grinols and Thorbecke have estimated the direct plus&#13;
indirect employment effects of changes in the U.S. trade balance with develop-&#13;
ing countries between 1963 and 1975 for a sample of 22 industries among the&#13;
157 sectors of the 1972 input-output table, where changes in the net trade&#13;
balance exceeded $175 million. The authors find that there has been a net&#13;
gain of 219 thousand jobs in the United States, which is reduced to 147&#13;
thousand jobs if the four food processing industries are excluded (1978, p. 11).&#13;
Having further examined "the effects on U.S. employment-of a hypothetical&#13;
10% change in the prevailing US-LDC trade pattern for every year of the sample&#13;
period" (p. 36), they conclude that "protectionistic measures as they relate&#13;
to US-LDC trade are more likely to reduce domestic employment than increase&#13;
it" (Ibid) .&#13;
The results obtained by Grinols and Thorbecke are explained by the&#13;
growing export surplus of the United States in manufactured trade with the&#13;
developing countries. Thus, between 1963 and 1975, the sum of positive&#13;
increments in the U.S. trade balance in manufactured goods with the developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17 -&#13;
countries in the 18 manufacturing industries (excluding food processing)&#13;
exceeded the sum of negative increments about three-and-a--half times. If we&#13;
adjust for differences in the absolute increment in trade flows, and calculate&#13;
the average number of jobs per $1 million of exports and imports, the conclu-&#13;
sions reached by Grinols and Thorbecke are reversed: an increase in exports&#13;
of $1 million would entail a gain of 34.7 jobs in industries of the first&#13;
group as compared to a loss of 56.3 jobs resulting from a $1 million increase&#13;
in imports in the second group, i.e., a ratio of .62 (p. 11).1/ At the same&#13;
time, to the extent that the application of protectionist measures would lead&#13;
to decreases in imports and exports by equal amounts, it is the latter results&#13;
that indicate the employment implications of such measures.&#13;
Estimates of the employment effects of increased trade with the&#13;
developing countries have also been made for Belgium and for Germany. In&#13;
the first case, the ratio of direct plus indirect employment for BF 1 billion&#13;
wurth of exports to that for imports has been estimated at .84 for 1970 by&#13;
utilizing a 27 sector input-output table, of which 20 sectors produce manu-&#13;
factured goods (de Grauwe, et al., 1978, p. 9). In the second case, two&#13;
sets of estimates are available.&#13;
Utilizing a 47 sector input-output table, with 28 sectors producing&#13;
manufactured commodities, Schumacher has estimated the ratio of the direct&#13;
pluis indirect employment effects of a balanced increase of German trade in&#13;
maniufactured goods with the developing countries at .96 while a net employ-&#13;
ment gain is shown if only the direct effects in the manufacturing sector&#13;
are considered (1977, p. 39). The latter estimate contrasts with more&#13;
1/ The cited estimates exclude processed food that is not part of manufactured&#13;
goods under the definition used, in this paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
recent calculations by Hiemenz and Schatz who projected a gain of 400 thousand&#13;
jobs through increased exports and a loas of 846 thousand jobs through increased&#13;
imports in trade in manufactured goods with the developing countries for 1985,&#13;
assuming that recent trends continue and utilizing the same industrial breakdown&#13;
as Schumacher (1979, pp. 48-49).&#13;
In turn, Lydall has utilized a 20 sector input-output table, of which&#13;
10 sectors produce manufactured goods, to estimate the direct plus indirect&#13;
employment effects of trade liberalization in selected industries of the&#13;
developed countries, matched by the re-spending of increased export proceeds&#13;
by the developing countries in the country of importation. Results obtained&#13;
for the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom show net losses&#13;
in employment if trade in textiles and clothing is liberalized; there is a&#13;
net gain if trade liberalization occurs in wood products, paper and printing,&#13;
and ferrous and nonferrous metals; and net employment effects are approximately&#13;
nil for machinery and other manufactured goods (1975, pp. 110-11).&#13;
Lydall has compared employment changes in selected import-competing&#13;
industries with across-the-board changes in export industries that would result&#13;
from the re-spending of increased export proceeds by the developing countries.&#13;
The re-spending assumption has also been made by Birnberg, who has compared&#13;
the direct employment effects of a 60 percent across-the-board tariff cut&#13;
for U.S. imports of manufactured goods other than textiles from the develop-&#13;
ing countries with the employment effects of the increase in U.S. exports trtLL&#13;
would result from the spending of the increment in the foreign exchange&#13;
earnings of the developing countries in the United States. Birnberg's results&#13;
show a gain of 31.5 jobs for a $1 million increase in the exports and a loss&#13;

These estimates of the employment effects of trade in manufactured&#13;
goods between developed and developing countries are subject to various&#13;
limitations. Lydall and Birnberg make different assumptions as regards&#13;
exports and imports; they as well as de Grauwe 8t aZ., Schumacher, and Hiemenz&#13;
and Schatz use highly-aggregated commodity classification schemes that include&#13;
products of varying labor intensity in the individual categories; while Grinols&#13;
and Thorbecke, who employ a more detailed classification scheme, cover only&#13;
selected commodity categories.&#13;
The Estimates of This Study&#13;
-In the present study, a detailed commodity framework has been used&#13;
to estimate the employment effects for the developed countries of the simultan-&#13;
eous expansion of manufactured exports and imports in their trade with the&#13;
developing countries. For this purpose, use has been made of a 184 commodity&#13;
category breakdown of the manufacturing sector that was earlier employed in a&#13;
study of the changing pattern of comparative advantage (Balassa, 1979). /&#13;
Each commodity category includes products that have similar economic charac-&#13;
teristics, including labor intensity.&#13;
The labor-input coefficients used in the calculations originate from&#13;
the U.S. Census of Manufacturing for the year 1975. The Census provides data&#13;
for the four-digit categories of the Standard Industrial Classification, which&#13;
1/ We have excluded from our purview primary products where the availability&#13;
of natural resources affects the outcome. At any rate, in public discussions&#13;
attention has been concentrated on the employment effects of trade in manu-&#13;
factured goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
have been combined whenever considered necessary in arriving at the 184 commodity&#13;
category classification scheme. This classification scheme has further been&#13;
matched against the UN Standard International Trade Classification that is&#13;
used in reporting trade statistics.&#13;
The U.S. labor-input coefficients have been utilized for the other&#13;
developed countries as well. While Lydall shows that labor-input coefficients&#13;
are negatively correlated with per capita incomes, the differences in the&#13;
coefficients are considerably smaller at the higher income levels of the&#13;
deve1oped countries (1975, p. 87). At any rate, by 1975 most developed&#13;
countries have approached -- and some have even exceeded -- U.S. incomes per&#13;
head.&#13;
At the same time, the choice of U.S. coefficients has been made&#13;
necessary by reason of the lack of labor-input coefficients in a comparable&#13;
coamodity breakdown for the other developed countries. In the only other&#13;
country, Japan, that has a detailed industrial classification scheme, rapid&#13;
lacreases of labor productivity have rendered the 1970 coefficients used&#13;
by Cline out af date, and comparability with the 184 comodity category&#13;
classification scheme could not be assured. Note further that unpublished&#13;
cadlculations by Robert E. Baldwin show that the use of Japanese input-output&#13;
coefticients give results very close to those obtained by Grinols and Thorbecke&#13;
for the sectors covered by the latter.&#13;
The coefficients pertain to labor inputs used directly in the&#13;
production process. In the absence of an input-output table in the appropriaate&#13;
breakdown, estimating the indirect employment effects of trade in manufactured&#13;
goods would have involved a very substantial effort. At the same time, for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
_dasons noted below, such an effort did not appear warranted.&#13;
To begia with calculating indirect effects on the basis of historical&#13;
coefficients assumes unchanged proportions of domestically produced and imported&#13;
iniputs that would not be appropriate for estimating the employment effects of&#13;
an expansion of trade. This is because product market equilibrium requires that&#13;
the marginal cost of domestically produced inputs equals the world market price&#13;
plus the tariff, so that the increased demand for inputsat higher export levels&#13;
would be satisfied from abroad.&#13;
Nontraded inputs by definition originate from domestic sources and&#13;
itiould ideally be included in the calculations. Such inputs are, however,&#13;
.,f limited importance, averaging 8 - 12 percent of the product price, and&#13;
thier omission is not likely to bias the results. This is because, other things&#13;
being equal, nontraded inputs used in import-substituting industries can be&#13;
expected to be more labor intensive than nontraded inputs used in export&#13;
industries.&#13;
Still, the question may be raised what difference the use of direct,&#13;
as against direct plus indirect, labor-input coefficients may make for the&#13;
results. Cline's estimates of the employment effects of multilateral trade&#13;
liberalization, reported above, show small differences between the two    -&#13;
alternatives in relation to the total trade of developed countries. Toe same&#13;
conclusion applies to Schumacher's estimates of the employment effects of&#13;
increased trade in manufactured goods between Germany and the developing countries.&#13;

Employment Effects in the Developed Countries Resulting from the Expansion&#13;
of Their Trade in Manufactured Goods with the Developing Countries&#13;
TMe employment effects in the developed countries that would resu2c&#13;
from a baZanced expansion of their trade in manufactured goods with the develop-&#13;
ing countriLes (i.e. with exports and imports rising by equal amounts) have been&#13;
estimated iLn the present study on the assumption of the unchanged composition&#13;
of exports and of imports. Under this assumption, comparisons of average labor-&#13;
input coefficients for exports and for goods competing with imports will indicate&#13;
the employment effects of balanced trade expansion.&#13;
Average labor-input coefficients for the exports and the imports of&#13;
manufactured goods in trade between developed and developing countries are&#13;
reported in Table 3. The estimates shown for eighteen industry groups are&#13;
weighted averages of the labor-input data obtained for the 184 industries,&#13;
derived by using the value of exports and imports in trade between developed&#13;
and developing countries in the year 1976 as weights. The table provides&#13;
estimates for the OECD as a whole, the United States, the EEC and Japan.l/&#13;
The estimates show the existence of considerable differences in&#13;
average labor-input coefficients for the exports and for the imports of manu-&#13;
factured goods of the developed countries in trade with the developing countries.&#13;
For the OECD, taken as a whole, the average number of jobs for $1 million of&#13;
output is 18.4 for exports to, and 28.5 for imports from, the developing&#13;
1/ The OECD includes the industrial countries (the United States, Canada,&#13;
the EEC, EFTA, and Japan) as well as the countries of Southern Europe,&#13;
(Greece, Spain, and Turkey), Australia and New Zealand. Differences in&#13;
country composition as well as differences in commodity composition&#13;
(e.g. synthetic fibers have been included with manufactured goods in the&#13;
184 industry breakdown although they are not part of commodity classes&#13;
5 to 8) account for differences in the value of manufactured trade shown&#13;
in Tables I and 2 and that reported in the subsequent tables.&#13;

countries, the ratio of the two being .65. The corresponding ratios are&#13;
.61 for the United States, .65 for the EEC, and .73 for Japan. Thus, among&#13;
the developed countries, the average ratio of labor-input coefficients for&#13;
exports and imports is negatively correlated with per capita incomes as the&#13;
leckscher-Ohlin theory would lead us to expect.&#13;
These estimates conflict with the by-now popular view, according&#13;
to which trade in manufactured goods between the developed and the developing&#13;
countries has negligible net employment effects. At the same time, they con-&#13;
firm the results reached in the author's study on the stages approach to&#13;
comparative advantage, according to which developing countries tend to specialize&#13;
in labor-intensive comodities.&#13;
Comparisons with the results obtained by other authors in regard to&#13;
the employment effects of trade with the developing countries offer further&#13;
interest. As shown above, the average ratio of direct plus indirect employment&#13;
coefficients for U.S. exports and imports of manufactured goods in trade with&#13;
the developing countries was .62 for selected industries in the Grinols-Thorbecke&#13;
study. Thus, the differences between the direct employment effects estimated&#13;
in this study and the direct plus indirect employment effects estimated by&#13;
Grinols and Thorbecke is small, although the comparability of the results&#13;
is reduced by differences in industry coverage.&#13;
In turn, de Grauwe's results for Belgium and Schumacher's estimates for&#13;
Germany refer to earlier years, and shifts have since occurred in favor of the&#13;
importation of labor-intensive goods, such as clothing and electronics, from&#13;
the developing countries at the expense of capital-intensive iron and steel and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

c; amicals- In fact, Schumacher's resulta show increases in the relative labor-&#13;
i..tensity of imports after 1972, although the ratio of estimated average di-rect&#13;
plus indirect labor-input coefficients for German exports and imports of manufactured&#13;
goods was only .94 for changes in the composition of this trade between 1972 and&#13;
1976 (1978, p. 10).i/ Furthermore, as we have seen, projections made by Hiemenz&#13;
and Schatz indicate a considerable employment loss for German trade in manufactured&#13;
goods with the developing countries.&#13;
Also, the Belgian and the German estimates are based on the assumption&#13;
that labor-input coefficients are the same for exports and for imports in each&#13;
industry group. The estimates of the present study, however, show the existence&#13;
of considerable differences in the coefficients as between the developed countries'&#13;
exports and imports in trade with the developing countries within most industry&#13;
groups. This is indicated by a comparison of average labor-input, coefficients for&#13;
exports and for imports in the 18 industry group breakdown (Table 3).&#13;
To begin with, there are large differences in average labor-input&#13;
coefficients for exports and imports in the case of rubber and plastic products;&#13;
stone, clay and glass products; and transportation equipment. In these industry&#13;
groups, the ratios of the average labor-input coefficients for exports as compared&#13;
to imports are .53, .79, and .84, respectively, for the OECD taken as a whole.&#13;
1/ Schumacher's more recent estimates do not report direct labor-input coefficients&#13;
alone. Also, there seems to be a conflict between estimates of direct plus&#13;
indirect employment effects in Schumacher's estimates reported in his 1977&#13;
(p. 39) and 1978 (p. 8) articles as well as between the results shown in two&#13;
of the tables in his 1978 paper (pp. 9 and 10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
The results for these industry groups are explained by the dominant&#13;
role played by highly labor-intensive rubber footwear in the developed countries'&#13;
imports, and by the relative importance of highly capital-intensive tires and&#13;
tubes in their exports, of rubber and plastic products; by the high share of&#13;
relatively labor-intensive glass containers in the imports, and the high share&#13;
of reLatively capital intensive exports of cement in the exports, of stone, clay&#13;
and glass products by the developed countries; and by the high share of relatively&#13;
labor--intensive ships and boats in the imports, and the high share of relatively&#13;
capital-intensive motor vehicles in the exports, of transportation equipment by&#13;
these countries.&#13;
Labor-input coefficients are higher for imports than for exports in&#13;
the trade of the OECD countries with the developing countries in most other&#13;
industry groups, too. The opposite result is shown only for printing and&#13;
publishing and for primary metals. But, in these cases, the differences are&#13;
small; the ratio of labor-input coefficients in export-import relationships&#13;
is 1.08 in the first case and 1.02 in the second. At the same time, printing&#13;
and publishing is a relatively unimportant item in trade between developed&#13;
and developing countries.l/&#13;
There are a few additional exceptions for individual developed&#13;
countries and country groups but the differences exceed 10 percent only for&#13;
transportation equipment in the United States (a ratio of 1.13), leather and&#13;
leather products in the EEC (a ratio of 1.25), and miscellaneous manufactured&#13;
products in Japan (a ratio of 1.36). In the United States, the result has&#13;
been due to the relatively high share of the imports of automobile parts and&#13;
accessories that are combined with capital-intensive motor vehicles; in the&#13;
EEC, the high export share of capital-intensive leather has contributed to the&#13;
outcome; while in Japan the exportation of relatively labor-intensive toys and&#13;
1/ Labor-input coefficients are the same for exports and for imports in the&#13;
caise of furniture and petroleum products where, due to data limitations,&#13;
further disaggregation was not feasible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27 -&#13;
iports goods is largely responsible for the result obtained in regard to&#13;
miscellaneous manufactured products.&#13;
The numerical magnitudes of average between and within industry group&#13;
differences on labor-input coefficients are of further interest. These can be&#13;
shown by comparing the ratios of average labor-input coefficients for exports&#13;
and imports reported above with the ratios derived on the assumption that&#13;
labor-input coefficients are invariant within each of the eighteen industry&#13;
groups. The relevant results are .65 and .71 for the OECD, taken as a whole,&#13;
.61 and .66 for the United States, .65 and .70 for the EEC, and .73 and .81&#13;
for Japan. It appears, then, that within-industry group differences in labor-&#13;
input coefficients account for about one-sixth of the difference in average&#13;
labor-input coefficients for exports and imports, estimated in a 184 commodity&#13;
category breakdown. It may be suggested that additional disaggregation would&#13;
further increase differences in the coefficieuts.&#13;
Thus far, we have compared average labor-input coefficients for&#13;
manufactured goods traded between developed and developing countries. These&#13;
coefficients will, be relevant in the event of a baZanced expansion of&#13;
manufactured trade between the two groups of countries. In such an eventuality,&#13;
the number of jobs lost through increased imports would be about one-half higher&#13;
than the number of jobs gained through exporting, for the OECD taken as a whole.&#13;
An alternative hypothesis postulates equiproportionate increases&#13;
in the exports and imports of manufactured goods in trade between developed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
and developing countries (i.e. identical rates of change for exports and inports'&#13;
for short, a             Zorionst expansion of trade.  Assuming further unchanged&#13;
export and :iport structures as beforehand, the employment effects of a proportiona&#13;
expansion of trade are indicated in Table 4 that provides information&#13;
on the labor content of manufactured exports, and of products competing with&#13;
manufactured imports, in the trade oi the developed countries with the develop-&#13;
ing countries.  The estimates have been derived by mul:iplying export and&#13;
import values for 1976 by the labor-input coefficients estimated in the&#13;
184 industry breakdown.&#13;
The results show substantial positive employment effects for the&#13;
OECD zountries in their trade in manufactured goods with the developing&#13;
countries.  Similar conclusions apply to the United States, the EEC, and&#13;
Japan. Thus, in the event of a proportional expansion of trade, the ratio of&#13;
jobs gained through exports to jobs lost through imports would be 2.8 in the OECD&#13;
taken as whole, 1.4 in the United States, 3.4 in the EZC, and 7.9 in Japan.&#13;
;. is apparent that differences in the results shown in Tables 3 and 4 ars&#13;
explained by intercountry variations in export-import ratios in manufactured&#13;
trade with the developing countries.&#13;
The proportional expansion of manufactured trade between developed&#13;
and developing countries would create new jobs in most industry groups&#13;
in the developed countries. Exceptions are textiles, clothing, lumber&#13;
and wood products, rubber and plastic products, leather and leather&#13;
products, and miscellaneous manufactures.  For the OECD countries,&#13;
taken together, a 10 percent proportional increase in trade flows would&#13;
entail the loss of altogether 31 thousand jobs in these industries as compared&#13;
to a total gain of 183 thousand jobs in the other industry groups. Comparable&#13;

figures are 19 thousand and 34 thousand for the United States and 11 chousand&#13;
and 82 thousand for the EEC.  Finally, Japan would experience a gain of&#13;
51 thousand jobs in its export industries, with practically no loss of jobs&#13;

The Skill-rntensitr of Trade&#13;
We have seen that average labor input-coefficients are about&#13;
one-half greater for the manufactured imports of the developed countries from&#13;
the developing countries than for their exports to these countries. The&#13;
opposite conclusion obtains if we consider professional and tachnical&#13;
labor alone.  In this occupational group, the ratio of labor-input coeffic'en:~-&#13;
for exports as compared to imports is 1.20 in the OECD taken as a whole,&#13;
1.20 in the United States, 1.29 in the EEC, and 1.12 in Japan (Table 5A)).&#13;
Thus, there would be a gain in the employment of professional and technical&#13;
labor i. the developed countries, even if one assumed a balanced expansion&#13;
of their trade in manufactured goods with the developing countries.  On the&#13;
OECD level, as well as for the EEC and Japan, there would also be gains in&#13;
the eploymene of foremen and skilled workars, while a small loss in this&#13;
category is shown for the United States. In turn, the largest losses would&#13;
be incurred in regard to semi-skilled and unskilled production workers, where&#13;
the ratio of labor-input coefficients for exports as compared to jnnorts is&#13;
.44 for the OECD taken as a whole, .42 for the United Stacas, .43 for the EEC.&#13;
2/&#13;
and .50 for Japan.-&#13;
1/ In all cases, we have taken one-tenth of the sum of positive and negative&#13;
employment balances shown in Table 4. It is apparent from the table&#13;
that the net emplovment effects for particular industries were generally&#13;
of the same sign in the individual developed countries and country groups&#13;
as for the OECD as a whole.&#13;
2/ Results for the individual occupational groups have been obtained by&#13;
utilizing U.S. statistics on Occupation by Industry for the year 1970.&#13;

The results cited in Table 5A point to the existence of considerable&#13;
differences in the occupational structure of production for exports and for&#13;
import substitution in the trade of the developed countries with the developing&#13;
countries. These differences are put into focus in Table 5B that provides&#13;
information on the average employment shares of the various occupational&#13;
categories in the manufactured exports and imports of the OECD countries, taken&#13;
together, the United States, the EEC, and Japan.&#13;
Among occupational categories, the share of professional and&#13;
techbical workers in total employment is nearly double for the exports than&#13;
for the imports of manufactured goods in the OECD councries' trade with the&#13;
developiag countries. The ralevant ratios are 1.96 for the United States,&#13;
1.99 for the EEC, and 1.53 for Japan, reflecting a less sophisticated export&#13;
structure ia the latter case.&#13;
Also, the share of foremen and skilled workers in total employment&#13;
Is about three-fourths higher for the exports than for the imports or the&#13;
OECD count-res in their manufactured trade with the developing count-:es, with&#13;
Japan ar the top (1.82) and the United States (1.o5) at the bottom of the&#13;
range. The differences go in the same dixrectยฑon,l/ but they are numerยฑica,-1'&#13;
smaller, for managers and adยฑnaistrators, clerical workers, service workers,&#13;
and for workers in construction, transportation, and material handling.&#13;
Dlfferences in the opposite d:trection are observed in regard to&#13;
sales workers and, in particular, for the largest category, unskilled and&#13;
1/  ExceDtcons are clerical workers in iapan and work-ers in cons=icrtcon,&#13;

ad semi-skilled produccion varkars-  In the  later case, the average&#13;
Vploymenc share of deveLoged countrl manu.fctured imports from the developDing&#13;
countries is about two-fifths lower than that of their axports, with tha United&#13;
Stacas (36 percent) and Japan (43 percent) being at the opposite ends of&#13;
the :ange. Again, these results conform to the Heckscher-Ohln theory of&#13;
intarnational specialization.&#13;
BY couparisou, Kaessin found that in 1957 the exports of the.&#13;
United States, Germany, Sweden, aud the United Kingdom were relatively skill-&#13;
intensive whareas skill intensity was higher for imports than that for&#13;
eXports in the Ntcherlands, Belgium, ltaly, Frauce, and Japan (1965, p. 291).&#13;
tzn  nterpretazti3 Keesยฑngts estimates, it should be recalled, however, that&#13;
the7 pertain to a relatively early postwar year and concern the total&#13;
manufactured trade of the countries in question that was doaiated by trade&#13;
among the developed countries themselves.&#13;
tn turn, 3aldwin and Lavis estimate that a 50 percent mul:ilateral&#13;
tarilf cut in =ufacturing (textiles excluded) would provide a nat QMployment&#13;
gain in the professional and tecb.ical labor as wall as in the mnagement and&#13;
ad-inistration categories, as against losses in al other labor categories, in&#13;
the United States (1978, p. 253).  A compazison of the 3aldvin-Lew-.s esCttes&#13;
with thos&amp; reported in Table SC shows that, an expected, incaased -zade vict&#13;
the developing countries would lead to a larger shift  arom lowvsll to hi gh-&#13;
skill occupations than that resulting from an increase in U.S. overall&#13;
trade.&#13;
While the estimates reported in Table SA indicata the employment&#13;
effects of a bcla .ed expansion of maufactured tr'a  between delop  and&#13;
daveloping count-ies in the various occupational categorias, the estrimaes of&#13;

Table 5C show the effects of pz'apcrti4o=n change in this trade. It is apparent&#13;
that an equยฑ-prcportionate increase in OECD exports and imports in trade&#13;
in manufac:ured goods with the developing countries would have a net emplov-&#13;
ment-creating effect in all eight occupational categories. The same results&#13;
have been obtained for the EEC and Japan and, with the exception of unskilled&#13;
and semi-skilled production workers, for the United States. Tor the latter&#13;
category, the U.S. showa a slight deficit.&#13;
The Human and the Physical Canital Tntensity of Trade&#13;
We have considered the effacts of trade in manufactured goods&#13;
between developed and developing countries on employment in the former group&#13;
of countries for various skill classes. In order to express the skill intensity&#13;
of trade in a single number, Keesing (1965, 1968, 1971)1/has calculated&#13;
ratios of jobs in  high-skilled   to low-skill occupations.  Civen the arbitrari-&#13;
ness involved in making such a distinction, we have instead followed Kenezt (196J)&#13;
in estimating the human-capital intensity of trade. This procedure also&#13;
petmits making comparisons between the physical and the human capital&#13;
iatensity of the exports and imports of the developed countries.&#13;
Physical capital and human capital coefficients have been taken from&#13;
"A 'Stages Approach' to Comparative Advantage," (Balassa, 1979) where the&#13;
derivation of these coefficients is described in detail. Two sets of coefficients&#13;
have been calculated:  "stock" and "flow" coefficients.  The former have been defined&#13;
as the value of fixed capital per worker (physical capital) and the discounted&#13;
1/ In his earlier work (1965 and 1968), Keesing also used U.S. labor input&#13;
coefficients for examining the occupational effects of the exports of&#13;
various irndustrial countries. In a later paper (1971), Keesing has made&#13;
use of data obtained for the individual industrial countries. This has&#13;
not been done in the present paper .for lack of comparable data on the&#13;
appropriate breakdown.&#13;

va:,ue of the difference between the average wage and the unskilled wage (human&#13;
ca ital), and the latter as nonwage value added per worker (physical capital)&#13;
and the average wage (human capital).&#13;
Table 6 provides information on average physical and human capital&#13;
coefficients for exports and imports of manufactured goods in the trade of&#13;
developed countries with the developing countries. As is apparent from the&#13;
table, for the OECD taken as a whole, capital coefficients for exports are&#13;
substantially higher than for imports. The average ratios of the coefficients&#13;
for exports and for imports are 1.58 for physical capital and 1.44 for human&#13;
capital utilizing the stock measure, and 1.48 and 1.28, respectively, utilizing&#13;
the flow measure.&#13;
Similar results have been obtained for the United States and the EEC,&#13;
except that in the latter case the stock measure shows the same ratios for&#13;
physical and for human capital.  Note further that in the EEC the ratio for&#13;
human capital under the flow measure (1.28) is roughly the same as that obtained&#13;
for Belgium, where this was estimated at 1.26 for 1970 (de Grauwe et al. 1977, p.8).&#13;
The ratios of physical and human capital coefficient for exports and&#13;
for imports are, however, substantially lower for Japan than for the other developed&#13;
countries. This result may be taken to reflect the fact that capital accumulation&#13;
in Japan has not been commensurate with incomes per head that have risen very&#13;
rapidly in recent years.&#13;
The cited estimates indicate the relatively high physical capital and&#13;
skill-intensity of the manufactured exports of the developed countries to the&#13;
developing countries as compared to their imports from these countries. It is&#13;
thus apparent that, in their manufactured trade with the developing countries,&#13;
the developed countries exchange physical and human capital for unskilled labor.&#13;

III.  Employment Implications of Prospective Trends in Trade in Manufatured&#13;
Goods between Develo2ed and Deieloping Countries 1/&#13;
ProJections for Growth and Trade&#13;
In the preceding section, we have examined the employment implicatiors&#13;
for the developed countries of a baZanced and a proportional expansion of theit&#13;
trade in manufactured goods with the developing countries.  Consideration has&#13;
further been given to the occupational structure and to the physical and human&#13;
capital-intensity of this trade.&#13;
Neither a balanced nor a proportional expansion of trade in manufac-&#13;
tured goods between developed and developing countries is a likely occurrence.&#13;
Rather, these alternatives represent extreme cases, assuming a zero trade&#13;
balance in manufactured goods on the margin in the first case, and an equi-&#13;
proportionate expansion of aZZ manufactured trade flows in the second.&#13;
Correspondingly, in order to evaluate the employment implications&#13;
of future trade in manufactured goods between the developed and the developing&#13;
countries, projections of trade flows would have to be made. In projecting&#13;
trade flows, we have taken the estimates of the World Development Report as a&#13;
point of departure.&#13;
The Report forecasts the following growth rates of the total exports&#13;
of manufactured goods from the developing countries between 1975 and 1985:&#13;
textiles, 6.2 percent; clothing, 8.3 percent; chemicals, 13.0 percent; iron and&#13;
steel, 14.5 percent; machinery and transport equipment, 17.3 percent; and other&#13;
manufactures 10.0 percent; averaging 12.2 percent (1978, p. 29). The same&#13;
estimates are employed in regard to the developing countries' exports to the&#13;
developed countries, which account for about three-fourths of the total.&#13;
1/ The calculations reported in this section were performed by Joung-Yong Lee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
We have applied the export growth rates assumed in the World&#13;
Development Report for 1975-85 to project the future exports of the developing&#13;
countries to the developed countries in individual industry groups for the&#13;
1976-86 period. The resulting estimates, reported in Tabla 7, entail an average&#13;
growth rate for manufactured exports of 12.6 percent, slightly higher than the&#13;
12.2 percent shown in the Report (p. 29).  The difference is largely due to the&#13;
fact that nonelectrical and electrical machinery and transport equipment, which&#13;
have the highest projected growth rate, had a larger share in the developing&#13;
countries exports of manufactured goods in 1976 than in 1975.&#13;
Our estimates for textiles and clothing represent a departure from&#13;
the projections of the World DeveZopment Report that call for developing country&#13;
exports to increase at an annual average rate of 4.5 percent in the first case,&#13;
and 5.5 percent in the second, between 1976 and 1986 (p. 28). The latter figures&#13;
appear overly low. For one thing, they assume no change in the market&#13;
share of the developing countries in the domestic consumption of textiles and&#13;
clothing in the developed countries, although the developing countries may further&#13;
increase their share at the expense of developed country exporters such as&#13;
Japan. For another thing, the estimates do not take account of the continuous&#13;
upgrading of the exports of textiles and clothing from the developing countries&#13;
that has raised the unit value of these exports at a rate much exceeding average&#13;
prices in world trade (Keesing 1978).&#13;
More generally, the question needs to be answered if the 1975-85&#13;
export growth rates projected in the World Development Report could be applied&#13;
to the 1976-86 period, given that the manufactured exports of the developing&#13;
countries to the developed countries rose by 29 percent in volume terms in&#13;
1976 (cf. p. 4 above). The results for 1977, an increase of 9 percent in&#13;
volume terms, would point to the need for a downward adjustment. However, this&#13;
decline has proved to be temporary and GATT reports that "in volume&#13;
terms ... exports from the oil-importing developing countries, which had only&#13;

a small increase in 1977, appear to have increased at a much faster pace,&#13;
maiutly on account of manufactures" in 1978 (GATT/1231, February 9, 1978, p. 4).&#13;
In fact, among the major developing country exporters of manufactured goods, the&#13;
volume of total exports rose by 14 percent in Korea and by 24 percent in Taiwan&#13;
in 1978 while manufactured export. including processed food, increased by&#13;
28 p-:rcent in Brazil./   The increases would be larger if we considered manu-&#13;
factured goods alone.2/&#13;
Furthermore, the Korean 15-year plan calls for manufactured exports&#13;
to rise at an average annual rate of 14.9 percent between 1977 and 1991 (1978,&#13;
p. 53); the corresponding projections of Taiwan's 6-year plan are 15.8 percent&#13;
for the period 1978-81 (1978, p. 12); and unofficial projections for Brazil&#13;
call for increases of slightly over 10 percent for total exports, with sub-&#13;
stantially higher growth rates for manufactured exports. Note finally that&#13;
the estimates of this study exclude, and those of the World Development Report&#13;
include, the countries of Southern Europe that have experienced considerably&#13;
lower growth rates of manufactured exports than all other developing countries,&#13;
taken as a group.&#13;
In estimating the future exports of manufactured goods from the&#13;
developed countries to the developing countries, we have applied the GDP&#13;
growth rate of 5.7 percent projected in the WorZd Development Report for the&#13;
developing countries in the 1975-85 period (1978, p. 32) to the 1976-86&#13;
period.-   Next, we have assumed varying income elasticities of demand in&#13;
1/  International FinanciaZ Statistics May 1979 and Conjuntura Econrmica, April 1979.&#13;
2/ Manufactured goods account for 85 percent of total exports in Korea and 88 percent&#13;
in Taiwan while processed food represents 38 percent of Brazilian exports of&#13;
manufactured goods, inclusive of processed food. At the same time, historically,&#13;
manufactured exports have been rising more rapidly than the exports of unprocessed&#13;
and processed primary commodities.&#13;
3/ Again, the definition of developing countries used in this study differs from&#13;
that employed in the Report, as we exclude the countries of Southern Europe; in&#13;
turn, we include Kuwait, Libya, and Saudi Arabia in the group. These adjust-&#13;
ments are unlikely to modify the results by more. than one or two tenths of a&#13;
percentage point, however.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41, -&#13;
demand in the developing countries fcr different groups of manufacturcKr&#13;
constrained to an average of 1.0 for all manufactured goods combtined. The&#13;
latter figure has been derived from the overall average elasticicy of 88&#13;
assumed in the Report (pp. 30, 32), with adjustment made for past relavionshi'4.&#13;
between the relevant elasticities. Thus, in the 1965-76 period, the ratio of&#13;
the elasticity of import demand for manufactured imports to that for all import&#13;
by the developing countries was 1.15.  In conformity with the experience of&#13;
this period, it has further been assumed that share of the developed countries&#13;
in the manufactured imports of the developing countries would remain unchanged&#13;
during the period of projection.&#13;
An income elasticity of import demand of approximately 1.2 has been&#13;
assumed for nonelectrical and electrical machinery and for instruments and&#13;
related products that are required by the investment effort developing&#13;
countries would have to make in order to reach high rates of economic growth.&#13;
In turn, an income elasticity of import demand of 1.0 has been assumed for&#13;
paper and paper products, printing and publishing, chemicals, and transport&#13;
equipment, where a high income elasticity of domestic demand is counter-balanced&#13;
by import substitution. Finally, an elasticity of import demand of approximately&#13;
0.5 has been assumed for all other industry groups, where income elasticities&#13;
of domestic demand are relatively low and the import substitution effort tends&#13;
to be considerable.&#13;
These estimates would give rise to an average rate of growth of&#13;
5.7 percent for the exports of manufactured goods from the developed countries&#13;
to the developing countries between 1976 and 1978 as compared to the projected&#13;
growth rate of 12.6 percent for their imports. Expressed in 1976 prices, there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
would be an absolute increment of $94 billion in the exports, and $68 billion&#13;
in the imports, of manufactured goods by the OECD countries in their trade with&#13;
the developing countries during the 1976-86 period (Table 7).  The ratio of exports&#13;
to imports would correspondingly decline from 4.3 in 1976 to 2.3 in 1986, with the&#13;
incremental ratio being 1.4.&#13;
The Employent Effects of Projected Trade Flows&#13;
The employment implications of projected tradein manufactured goods&#13;
between developed and developing countries will be considered in the following&#13;
for the OECD taken as a whole. The estimates have been made on the assumption&#13;
that labor-input coefficients would remain unchanged during the 1976-86 period.&#13;
Correspondingly, changes in employment resulting from trade flows have been&#13;
overestimated by neglecting future increases in labor productivity and the&#13;
substituticn of capital for labor in response to increases in real wages.&#13;
A,s shown in Table 8A, the projected expansion of trade in manufactured&#13;
goods between the developed and the developing countries would have practically&#13;
no net effect on employment in the former group of countries. The increase of&#13;
employment in exEorts is estimated at 1747 thousand and the decline of employ-&#13;
ment in imports at 1736 thousand.&#13;
The average labor-input coefficients for increases in exports and in&#13;
imports aret estimated at 18.6 and 25.5, respectively, with their ratio being&#13;
.73. It is thus apparent that the projections would entail a slight reduction&#13;
in the labor-intensity of imports from the developing countries that would&#13;
result from changes in the commodity composition of this trade. Similar consi-&#13;
derations apply to the capital coefficients shown in Table 8C.&#13;
Nevertheless, substantial differences in labor-input ccefficients&#13;
and in capital intensity remain as between projected exports and imports in&#13;
manufactured trade between developed and developing countries.  Also, there are&#13;
considerable differences in projected changes in employment among occupational&#13;

categories, involving a shift from low-skill to high-skill employment. The&#13;
major loser is the unskilled and seml-skilled production workers category, with&#13;
a net decline of 197 'thousand jobs. These results are not surprising, given&#13;
the occupational distribution of labor in production for exports and for imports&#13;
in the developed countries..&#13;
Prima facie, it is surprising, however, that the largest projected&#13;
gain among the skilled and technical labor categories is shown for foremen&#13;
and skilled workers, with an incremental export-import ratio of 1.54, rather&#13;
than for professional and technical workers, where the incremental ratio is&#13;
1.18. This result is explained by the fact that in electrical machinery&#13;
and equipment, the industry group with the highest professional and technical&#13;
labor coefficients, imports from developing countries are projected to rise&#13;
at a rapid rate, with the absolute increment in imports exceeding the increment&#13;
in the exports of these commodities between 1976 and 1986.&#13;
At the same time, projected increases of imports of electrical&#13;
machinery and equipment from the developing countries are likely to involve&#13;
the increased importation of parts, components, and accessories, coupled with&#13;
the eventual dominance of these countries in the world export of radios,&#13;
television sets, automotive electrical equipment, and simple electronics. The&#13;
products in question have lower professional and technical labor requirements&#13;
than electrical machinery and equipment in general. This is not shown by the&#13;
results, however, because the occupational statistics were not available in&#13;
sufficient detail, so that a distinction between the two groups of electrical&#13;
machinery and equipment could not be made.&#13;
It follows that the results shown in Table 8A understate the gain&#13;
in professional and technical employment in the developed countries that would&#13;
result from increased trade in manufactured goods with the developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
'oountries. The same conclusion is likely to apply to ot:her skilled categories,&#13;
all of which show a net employment gaia. Thus, the shift from low-skill to&#13;
Ihigh-skill occupations in the developed countries, resulting from their increased&#13;
trade in manufactured goods with the dexveloping countries, would be greater than&#13;
estimated here.&#13;
Among the 18 industv. groups, total employment in the developed&#13;
countrยฑes would rise in paper and allied products, prizting and publishing,&#13;
chemicals and allied products, primar7 metals and fabricated metal products,&#13;
with the largest gains evperienced in nonelectrical =achiner;, transDort&#13;
equipment, and instruments and related products (Table 83).  In turn, there&#13;
would be employment losses in textiles, clothing, l=ber and wood products,&#13;
furniture, rubber and plastic products, leather and leather products,&#13;
electrical machinery and equipment, and miscellaneous -manufactures, whereas&#13;
practically no change is shown for petroleun and coal products and stone,&#13;
clay, and glass products. The implications of these results will be examined&#13;
in the concluding sectica of the paper.&#13;
Conclusions and Policy Innlications&#13;
We have seen that the export surplus of the developed industrial&#13;
countries in manufactured trade wit.  the developing countries increased from&#13;
$36.3 billiot in 1973 to $96.8 b.llยฑou in 1977.  And while the bulk of this&#13;
increase occurred in trade with the oil-sxor:ยฑng develoDing countries, the&#13;
export surplus  :n manufactured trade with the oil-i=mportng developing&#13;
countries also rose fr=c $23.9 billion ia 1973 to $42.2 bill4on in 1977.&#13;
All major industrial countries and country groups experienced an&#13;
increase. ia t.eir trade surplus in manu-ac:ured 3oods with the oil-i-nportins&#13;
developizg  out-rias, with the largest inc=eases shown for Japan and the&#13;
smallest for the  nit4ed States.  These differences have beer. ex:l-tnad bv&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
reference to differences in the initial situation in 1973 and in the trade&#13;
policies followed.&#13;
We have further considered the employment implications for the developed&#13;
countries of their manufactured trade with the developing countries. The employ-&#13;
ment effects of a baZanced expansion of trade have been indicated by the use of&#13;
labor-input coefficients that are, on the average, one-half larger for the&#13;
imports than for the exports of manufactured goods in the developed countries.&#13;
In turn, due to differences in trade volume, the ratio of jobs gained through&#13;
exports to jobs lost through imports in the OECD countries would be 2.8 in the&#13;
event of proportional increase in their manufactured exports and imports in&#13;
trade with the developing countries, taking 1976 trade flows as a basis.&#13;
Neither a balanced increase nor a proportionate increase in manu-&#13;
factured trade between developed and developing countries is a likely occurrence,&#13;
however. We have, therefore, estimated the employment implications of the&#13;
expected expansion of this trade in the period 1976-86, by taking the projections&#13;
of the WorZd Development Report as a starting point. The results show no net&#13;
employment effects for the OECD countries as well as a continuing shift of&#13;
labor from low-skill to high-skill occupations in these countries. Particular&#13;
interest attaches to the effects of trade in manufactured goods on the skill-&#13;
composition of labor, since one should look to general economic policies rather&#13;
than trade policies to ensure a satisfactory level of overall employment.&#13;
The upgrading of the labor force, as well as the exchange of physical&#13;
and human capital for unskilled labor, would have favorable effects on resource&#13;
allocation and on economic growth in the developed countries.1l At the same&#13;
time, welfare gains are not limited to the exchange of productive factors&#13;
1/ Nevertheless, in this study the rate of GNP growth has been taken as exogenous&#13;
and estimates of the effects of trade on economic growth have not been made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
through trade. 7hus, additiont.l gains woult be forthecoming as a result of&#13;
increased competitiou that provides inducements to technological change.&#13;
The shift from low-skill to high-skill oc,upations would be associated&#13;
with a shift of labor from unskilled-labor Intensive to skill-and physical&#13;
capital-intensive industries.  Tle sim of Job losses in the former group of&#13;
industries would not, however, reach one millicn, accounting for a small&#13;
proportion of employment in these industries. In the case of textiles, clothing,&#13;
leather and leather products, the estimated job loss of 416 thousand compares&#13;
to a total employment of 9213 thousand in this sector in the OECD countries,&#13;
taken together, in 1976.  For the miscellaneous manufacturing product group,&#13;
the comparable figures are 57 thousand and 1421 thousand (Table 8b and OECD,&#13;
Labor Force Statistics, 1978).&#13;
Note further that the ten-year time period considered in this study&#13;
may permit adjustments to take place among industries and allow sufficient&#13;
time for the upgrading of labor. In fact, one may envisage larger increases&#13;
in the imports of manufactured goods by the developed countries from the develop-&#13;
ing countries than projected in the WorZd Development Report without appreciable&#13;
adverse effects on employment in import-competing industries. For one thing,&#13;
the Report foresees a decline in the incremental share of manufactured goods&#13;
imported from the developing countries in developed country markets from 7.1&#13;
percent in 1970-75 to 5.4 percent in 1975-85 (1978, p. 28), despite the large&#13;
increase in this share that occurred between 1975 and 1976. For another thing,&#13;
there are possibilities for additional increases in the share of exports to the&#13;
developing cotntries in the manufactured output of the developed countries,&#13;
which is projected to rise only slightly from the 1975 level in the Report.I/&#13;
- The above considerations indicate the advantages of liberal trade&#13;
policies for the developed countries. This conclusion is strengthened if we&#13;
1/ Results based on trade data arid on information provided in the WorZd&#13;
7r.,erlt .'k'frlrt8 (p. 28).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
consider that the import-competing industries of the developed countries may not&#13;
experience job losses in absolute terms inasmuch as increased demand associated&#13;
with economic growth leads to higher domestic con:;umption and production.&#13;
Furthermore, increased imports of labor-intensive products may be a substitute&#13;
for the immigration of unskilled and semi-skilled labor, whether legal or&#13;
illegal.!' By disregarding labor migration, the above calculations overestimate&#13;
job losses to the nationals of the developed countries in import-competing&#13;
industries.&#13;
Reference should further be made to the increasing importance of&#13;
developing country markets for the developed industrial countries. Excluding&#13;
U.S.-Canada trade that is in large part intra-firm trade and one-third of which&#13;
does not involve the payment of duties in the framework of the automotive&#13;
agreement, as well as trade in manufactured goods within the European industrial&#13;
free-trade area, the developing countries offer larger markets to the exports&#13;
of the develped industrial countries than does trade among groups of these&#13;
countries. In fact, the ratio of the sales of manufactured goods by the&#13;
developed industrial countries in developing country markets to their exports&#13;
to other developed industrial countries increased from 1.03 in 1973 to 1.55 in&#13;
1977. And while increases were much larger than the average in manufactured&#13;
exports to the oil-exporting developing countries, with the ratio of these&#13;
exports to trade among groups of developed industrial countries rising from&#13;
.25 to .66, increases in this ratio are shown with respect to exports to the&#13;
oil-importing developing countries as well (from .78 in 1973 to .89 in&#13;
1979).&#13;
1/ In the case of Germany, one-fifth of the projected job loss would be&#13;
compensated by a decline in immigration (Hiemenz and Schatz, 1979, p. 50).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
Concentrating our attention to the oil-importing developing countries,&#13;
it may be suggested that increases in the manufactured exports of these countries&#13;
have multiplicative effects on their national incomes and, by increasing&#13;
their creditworthiness for borrowing in international markets, on their&#13;
imports.  It follows that, apart from adverse effects on the economic growth&#13;
of the developing countries, protectionist actions taken in the developed&#13;
countries would adversely affect economic growTth in the developed countries&#13;
themselves by foregoing employment gains in high-skill occupations and in&#13;
technologically advanced industries that can be obtained through increased&#13;
trade in manufactured goods.&#13;

            The changing international division of
            labor in manufactured goods
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The paper reviews recent changes in
            trade in manufactured goods between developed and developing
            countries and examines the employment effects of this trade
            for the former group of countries. It is shown that the
            developing countries have assumed increased importance as
            markets for developed country exporters and that these
            trends are expected to continue in the future. At the same
            time, the net employment effects of the projected expansion
            of trade for the developed countries would be practically
            nil and employment changes in their import-competing
            industries would be small as compared to total employment in
            those industries. Simultaneously, the developed countries
            would derive benefits through a shift from low-skill to
            high-skill occupations, the exchange of physical and human
            capital for unskilled labor, and technological change.
