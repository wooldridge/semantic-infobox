&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Recent economic developments                      Largely owing to the impact of labor unrest&#13;
Global GDP growth is projected to acceler-        on exports from the automotive sector and&#13;
ate gradually, from 2.4Â  percent in 2013 to       rising imports related to public investment,&#13;
3.5Â percent in 2016, mainly reflecting a slow     net exports continued to weigh on headline&#13;
but steady improvement in outturns among          growth. As a result, by the end of 2013q3 real&#13;
high-income economies. Growth in high-            GDP growth was still below potential, and the&#13;
income economies is expected to rise from         output gap had widened.&#13;

ported by still very loose monetary policy,       reach the July 2013 growth forecast of 2013&#13;
a diminished drag on growth from govern-          real GDP growth. In manufacturing the&#13;
ment and household budget consolidation           Purchasing Managersâ&#128;&#153; Index fell to 49.9&#13;
efforts, and pent-up demand for consumer          (seasonally adjusted) in December, halt-&#13;
durables and investment goods. The base-          ing the tepid recovery that started in Octo-&#13;
line projection assumes a timely resolution to    ber. The business activity subindex (output&#13;
the debt ceiling debate in the United States,     conditions) receded 4.7 points, whereas the&#13;
steady progress in economic rebalancing in        new sales orders subindex (demand condi-&#13;
the Eurozone, and some additional fiscal          tions) improved marginally. In addition, the&#13;
stimulus in Japan to help offset a drag from      employment index fell below the neutral&#13;

                                            draws on detailed customs transaction data received from SARS as part of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Exporter Dynamics Database. The&#13;
growth over 2007â&#128;&#147;12&#13;
                                            SARS data cover more than 20,000 exporters over 2001â&#128;&#147;12 and include data on individual export transactions (value and&#13;
                                            volume) by product and destination.&#13;
                                                 The analysis has a few limitations. First, it depends on the coverage and quality of the data available from UN Comtrade&#13;
                                            and SARS. In both cases key data (such as on exports to Southern African Customs Union member countries) are largely missing&#13;
                                            (see boxÂ 2.3 below). There may well be other data limitationsâ&#128;&#148;systematic or otherwise, such as on export unit valuesâ&#128;&#148;that&#13;
                                            will impact the robustness of the findings. Second, while the customs transactions data provide valuable insights into how&#13;
                                            individual firms enter and exit export markets, expand, and diversify, these data provide no information on firmsâ&#128;&#153; other char-&#13;
                                            acteristics, including size, ownership, investment levels, and productivity. This update thus describes export performance and&#13;
                                            patterns but cannot test the determinants of the performance.&#13;

                                                 for exports to contribute to employment growth? The mismatch suggests that overall export growth is unlikely to have an&#13;

                                                 Despite being associated with a higher skills ratio, the recent rise in exports to Sub-Saharan Africa is associated with slightly&#13;
                                                 lower wages, value added, and human capital (in years of schooling) than exports to traditional Organisation for Economic&#13;
                                                 Co-operation and Development markets like the European Union and the United States (box figure 2), suggesting that the rise&#13;
                                                 was accompanied by a relative increase in labor demand for lower wage workers. On the other hand the physical capital of&#13;
                                                 goods destined for Africa is higher than those destined for the European Union, and is roughly on par with the capital intensity&#13;
                                                 of exports to the United States. This suggests for goods destined to Sub-Â­  Saharan Africa a potential decline in overall labor&#13;
                                                 demand in relative terms. Thus, the net labor impact of the relative increase in exports to Sub-Saharan Africa is unclear.&#13;

                                  Box      Exports to countries in the Southern African Customs Union&#13;
                                 2.3           In November 2013 the South African Revenue Service revised its reporting of trade data to include exports and imports with&#13;
                                               its Southern African Customs Union (SACU) partners: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland. (Prior to this date, official bal-&#13;
                                               ance of payments statistics included estimates of bilateral trade with Southern African Customs Union partners.) The effect was&#13;
                                               a deep cut into South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s reported trade deficit. The reason for the revision is that trade data reported by South African&#13;

                                               partners (by between 96.0Â percent and 99.7Â percent across years compared with the figures reported in the SACU Statistical&#13;
                                               Database). So, most analytical work on South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s trade, including the analysis in this report, ignores trade with SACU part-&#13;

                                                    In 2011/12 the total value of South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s exports to SACU partners was close to $12.7Â billion, with Botswana and&#13;
                                               Namibia together accounting for more than 72Â percent (box figure). Including exports to SACU countries has major implications&#13;

&amp;#12;      Beyond super-exporters: promoting entry of small and medium-size enterprises&#13;
Box   or the survival and growth of established exporters?&#13;
2.4   Exporting comes at a costâ&#128;&#148;firms must establish customer and distributor relationships, learn about changing market trends&#13;
      and regulations, and pay for licensing, customs, and shipping. This is why the survival rate of new export entrants tends to be&#13;
      low, particularly in developing countries. It is also why there is a sensible argument for government support in overcoming fixed&#13;
      costs and information asymmetries that act as barriers to entry and survival in exporting. But it is important to establish some&#13;
      criteria on which firms to support amid multiple priorities and limited resources.&#13;
           The firm-level export data give some useful indications of the factors associated with the survival and growth of South&#13;
      African exporters. Two things seem to matter most: initial export value and experience (box figure):&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Value of initial exports. Export spells that begin with an initial export value of more than $50,000 end up lasting&#13;
                                                                                                                                                            33&#13;
                much longer than lower valued shipments.&#13;
           â&#128;¢	 Exporting experience. A firm having at least two years of experience more than doubles the chances that an export&#13;
                spell will survive at least two more years. This reflects the fact that firms and export relationships that have survived&#13;
                the first two years have overcome fixed costs, have proven themselves reliable and competitive, and are beginning to&#13;
                reap the benefits of learning by exporting.&#13;
           What does this suggest about policies to support exporters? While there are sound reasons for helping small and medium-&#13;
      size firms export for the first time, many of these firms lack the scale or quality to compete in domestic markets let alone&#13;
      take on the added costs and uncertainties of exporting. It may be more efficient to focus on ensuring that firms that have              The structure of&#13;

&amp;#12;Box   Input costs and minerals beneficiation&#13;
2.5   As a major producer of minerals and exporter of metal-based manufactures, South Africa has opportunities for export expan-&#13;
      sion not only in processing more minerals and metals but also in raising the value of what is being processed. The average&#13;
      unit prices of metals exports vary widely, offering scope for countries to move to higher quality (and thus higher value)&#13;
      varieties, both across and within stages of production (Mandel 2011). Looking at the iron and steel value chain, however,&#13;
      South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s exports seem to be moving in the opposite directionâ&#128;&#148;toward basic production and lower quality (box figure).&#13;
      In 2000 level 1 products (iron ore and concentrates) accounted for just 18Â percent of exports (by value), but by 2012 their&#13;
      share had more than tripled to 57Â percent. By contrast, the share of level 2 products (ferro-alloys) and level 3 products&#13;
      (semifinished/finished steel) in exports declined dramatically, with level 3 products falling from a 44Â percent share to just&#13;
      13Â percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  35&#13;
           One reason for the shift was the growth in prices for basic commodities like iron ore. Another is that while participating&#13;
      in higher value-added segments should deliver a more stable premium over time, it also has costsâ&#128;&#148;it requires investment&#13;
      in research and skills, access to raw materials, reliable and cost-effective power, access to imported technologies, and cost-&#13;
      effective, flexible transport to reach global export markets. Amid high transport costs for noncommodities (see table 2.3&#13;
      above), rising costs and declining reliability of power, and import parity pricing on key inputs, the economics of adding value&#13;
      do not add up.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Price distortions&#13;

            South Africa economic update : focus on
            export competitiveness
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In its National Development Plan 2030
            and its New Growth Path (2011), South Africa identifies the
            export sector as an engine for faster, more inclusive, and
            job-intensive growth. The National Development Plan is
            targeting export volume growth of 6 percent a year, to
            achieve an annual increase in real Gross Domestic Product,
            or GDP growth of about 5.5 percent and to help generate 11
            million new jobs by 2030. Despite successes in some
            subsectors, South Africa will need to greatly improve its
            export performance to meet these targets. The report
            highlights opportunities for growth, particularly with
            Sub-Saharan Africa being the largest market for non-mineral
            exports. It also explores strategic directions that can
            ignite export growth and help South Africa realize its goals
            of creating jobs and reducing poverty and inequality.
