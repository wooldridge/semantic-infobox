Recommendation of the Committee under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement on the proposed Financing (Africa Higher Education Centers of Excellence&#13;
Project) to the Republic of Benin&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of Agreement of the&#13;
International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits its recommendation pursuant to&#13;
said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association extend to the Republic of Benin (the Recipient) a&#13;
credit in an amount equivalent to SDR 5,300,000. The purpose of said credit is to support the Recipient to&#13;
promote regional specialization of the Participating University in areas that address regional challenges&#13;
and strengthen the capacities of this University to deliver quality training and applied research.&#13;
1.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to extend such a financing, and of&#13;
the purposes to which the proceeds of the financing are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project toward the financing of which the proceeds of&#13;
such financing are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I of said&#13;
Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
Republic of Benin and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of the Republic of Benin.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said project merits financial assistance from the Association,&#13;
and hereby recommends said project for such assistance.&#13;
