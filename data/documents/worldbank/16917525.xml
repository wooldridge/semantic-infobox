2.    Pursuant to recent discussions between the Bank and the Donor, the Bank&#13;
proposes to amend paragraph 11.1 of the Administration Agreement to extend the closing&#13;

Paragraph 11.1:&#13;
"11.1. It is expected that the Contribution will be fully disbursed by the Bank by&#13;
October 31, 2014. The Bank shall only disburse Contributions for the purposes of&#13;
this Agreement after such date with the written approval of the Donor."&#13;

4.    The Bank will disclose this Agreement and related information on this Trust Fund&#13;
