        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Many studies have found that countries
            with abundant natural resources grow more slowly than those
            without&#151;a phenomenon often known as the &#147;resource curse&#148; or
            the &#147;curse of oil.&#148; Some development specialists are
            concerned that foreign aid may also cause a resource curse.
            Recent research is not conclusive, but certainly does not
            rule out the possibility. This Note suggests ways to avoid
            this risk and urges more attention be devoted to it.
