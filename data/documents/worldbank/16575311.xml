Concerning fiscal performance, on the basis&#13;
of the first quarter, the projections for 2012&#13;
would indicate that slippages in current&#13;
spending (particularly because of an under-&#13;
estimation of the cost of keeping retail fuel&#13;
prices frozen) would offset higher-than-&#13;
expected oil revenue (see text Table below).&#13;
As a result, the overall deficit on a cash basis&#13;
is expected to reach 2.7 percent of GDP. As&#13;
in past years, the budgeted amount for&#13;
compensating SONARA for its revenue&#13;
shortfall is expected to fall short: an&#13;
estimated CFAF 400 billion being needed in&#13;
2012 instead of the CFAF 170 billion&#13;
budgeted.&#13;

&amp;#12;Against this backdrop, efforts to increase                 particularly for food and fuel, should be&#13;
the economyâ&#128;&#153;s resilience to shocks should                  openly and candidly discussed. Data show&#13;
be strengthened. The reduced level of                      that these subsidies mostly favor the rich&#13;

Efforts to create a liquid secondary market&#13;
for government bonds would help sustain                    A comprehensive and carefully planned&#13;
investorsâ&#128;&#153; interest in future bond issues.                 approach is necessary to reform the current&#13;
Improvements in fiscal reporting would also                system, and decide how much and when to&#13;

make the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal position more                 compensate. These decisions should be&#13;

In addition, the country is diverse with a&#13;
geography that ranges from Sahelian semi-&#13;
desert in the north through grassland to&#13;
equatorial forest in the south, favoring&#13;
varied economic and agricultural activities.&#13;
Furthermore, Cameroon is endowed with&#13;
significant natural resources, including oil,&#13;
high value timber species, and agricultural&#13;
products (coffee, cotton, cocoa). Untapped&#13;
resources include natural gas, bauxite,&#13;
diamonds, gold, iron, and cobalt.&#13;

Despite this diversity, Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s export&#13;

&amp;#12;                   Box 3 : Trade and Poverty: A Discussion of the Literature&#13;
 A number of recent studies emphasize the importance of complementary policies in determining&#13;
 the benefits or costs of trade for developing countries. The way greater trade openness affects&#13;
 poverty depends on a variety of structural characteristics that may help or hamper a countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
 ability to take advantage of international competition. Trade liberalization should therefore not&#13;
 be seen in isolation and additional policies are needed to enhance its beneficial impact,&#13;
 including on poverty.&#13;
&#13;
 In its simplest form, trade theory suggests that the abundant factor should see an increase in its&#13;
 real income when a country opens up to trade. If the abundant factor in developing countries is&#13;
 unskilled labor, then this framework suggests that the poor (unskilled) in developing countries have&#13;
 the most to gain from trade. Krueger (1983) has used this insight to argue that trade reforms in&#13;
 developing countries should be pro-poor, since these countries are most likely to have a&#13;
 comparative advantage in producing goods made with unskilled labor.&#13;
&#13;
 From a dynamic perspective, economic growth plays an important role in reducing poverty and&#13;
 trade is argued to lead to the needed increases in productivity to sustain growth. Freer trade&#13;
 provides greater incentives for investment, benefits of scale and competition, limitation on rent-&#13;
 seeking activities favored by trade restrictions, and openness to new ideas and innovations&#13;
 (Grossman and Helpman, 1991; Lucas, 1988).&#13;
&#13;
 However, should the re-allocation of factors be hampered, the expected benefits from freer trade&#13;
 may not materialize. For incomes of the unskilled to increase, labor needs to be able to move out of&#13;
 contracting sectors and into expanding ones. Davis and Mishra (2006), Goh and Javorcik (2006) and&#13;
 Topalova (2006) suggest that labor in the real world may not be as mobile: there are too many&#13;
 barriers to entry and exit for firms, and too many barriers to labor mobility for workers.&#13;
&#13;
 Against this backdrop, Winters et al. (2004) suggested that freer trade should be combined with&#13;
 other policies encouraging investment, allowing effective conflict resolution, and promoting&#13;
 human-capital accumulation. Bolaky and Freund (2008) show that trade reforms actually lead to&#13;
 income losses in highly regulated economies. Excessive regulations restrict growth because&#13;
 resources are prevented from moving into the most productive sectors and to the most efficient&#13;
 firms within sectors. Le Goff and Singh (2012) suggest that trade openness tends to reduce poverty&#13;
 in African countries, as their financial sector grows deeper, their education level higher, and their&#13;
 governance stronger.&#13;

In a world characterized by trade in tasks         during      the     manufacturing         process&#13;

rather than products undertaken by firms           intermediate products cross many borders.&#13;

In the port clearance process, customs play            A sequential analysis of delays at the port&#13;
&#13;
an important role, and they have generally             shows, however, that the time taken&#13;

&#13;
source of delays. Accordingly, most efforts            customs declaration lodging (operational&#13;

&amp;#12;    Box 5 : Individual Performance Contracts in Cameroon Customs: A World Premiere&#13;
   As in many developing countries,&#13;
   Customs revenue is an important&#13;
   component of fiscal revenue. About a&#13;
   quarter of government revenue is&#13;
   collected by Customs. Hence it is&#13;
   important for Cameroon to reconcile the&#13;
   goal of enforcing compliance with the&#13;
   trade facilitation goal of expediting cargo&#13;
   clearance of traders deemed to be usually&#13;
   compliant.&#13;
&#13;
   Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s Customs administration has&#13;
   suffered from corruption and struggled to&#13;
   identify     options    for    improving                 Dwell Time (Days)&#13;
                                                 19.8&#13;
   governance. A customs reform program&#13;
                                                 19.6&#13;
   was introduced, seeking to reduce             19.4&#13;
   corruption, while simultaneously raising      19.2&#13;
   revenue collection. The reform included       19.0&#13;
                                                 18.8&#13;
   the installation of ASYCUDA (an&#13;
                                                 18.6&#13;
   automated customs clearance system)&#13;
                                                 18.4&#13;
   which would enable the administration to      18.2&#13;
   not only track the processing of each         18.0&#13;
   consignment,      but    also    measure                  2008              2009           2010&#13;
&#13;
   performance against a number of criteria         Source: Cameroonian authorities&#13;
   relevant to the reform.&#13;
&#13;
   A continuation of these efforts has been the introduction in 2009 of individual performance&#13;
   contracts â&#128;&#147; making Cameroon the first country in the World to adopt such an approach. These&#13;
   performance contracts use objective and quantifiable data from the automated computer&#13;
   system. The objectives of customs administration (facilitation and enforcement) are&#13;
   complemented by specific objectives, which aim at abolishing bad practices. The results are&#13;
   encouraging: higher revenue collection, shorter clearance times, and lower corruption&#13;
   (measured through systematic firm surveys of a representative sample of customs brokers&#13;
   undertaken before, during, and after the experimentation).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This suggests that customs is just one of the       operations from the port to final inland&#13;
many regulatory agencies. An approach               destinations for notable improvement to&#13;
focused only on customs reforms needs,              traders. Only a comprehensive approach to&#13;
therefore, to be replaced by a more                 the problems encountered at the gateway&#13;
comprehensive one involving the complete            can lead to improvement of efficiency that&#13;

                                                                           July 2012, Issue No. 4 / Page 20&#13;
&amp;#12;would enable the Cameroonian traders to&#13;
compete with their African and international&#13;
counterparts.&#13;
&#13;
While     Cameroon        through      targeted&#13;
interventions has been improving the&#13;
physical operations of the Douala port, the&#13;
critical mass of needed reforms is still&#13;
lacking. Attention should be on streamlining&#13;
the documentation process at the port&#13;
through adequate coordination of the many&#13;
actors (shippers, trade auxiliaries, border&#13;
management agencies, facilities operators,&#13;
and logistics services providers).&#13;
&#13;
One framework for that is an operational&#13;

Tariff Nomenclature&#13;
&#13;
The Common Tariff Nomenclature (CTN) is a&#13;
harmonized system for goods classification&#13;
that would be applicable to all CEMAC&#13;
member states. The system is designed for&#13;
classifying               goods              with      the    same&#13;
characteristics                        and          similar   duty&#13;
requirements. This system is known to&#13;
reduce delays, decrease transactions costs,&#13;
and make the Common External Tariff (CET)&#13;
easier to implement.                                                                               Photo credit: Raju Jan Singh&#13;

            Stepping out into the world an economic
            update on Cameroon with a focus on trade facilitation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            With this Cameroon economic update, the
            World Bank is pursuing a program of short, crisp and
            frequent country economic reports. These economic updates
            provide an analysis of the trends and constraints in
            Cameroon's economic development. Each issue, produced
            bi-annually, provides an update of recent economic
            developments, as well as a special focus on a topical issue.
            The economic updates aim to share knowledge and stimulate
            debate among those interested in improving the economic
            management of Cameroon and unleashing its enormous
            potential. This fourth issue of the Cameroon economic update
            is entitled 'stepping out into the world a special
            focus on trade facilitation'. It reviews the challenges
            and opportunities related to trade facilitation in Cameroon.
            The coverage is not meant to be exhaustive, but puts an
            emphasis on particular areas that would require the
            country's sustained attention: a transformative trade
            facilitation agenda around which all stakeholders could be mobilized.
