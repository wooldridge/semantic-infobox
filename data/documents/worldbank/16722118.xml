      Brazil: Analysis of the political economy of investment in sanitation (with a focus on sewerage), over a period of roughly 15 years, since&#13;
      the 1993 launch of the Water Sector Modernization Project (known in Brazil as Programa de ModernizaÃ§Ã£o do Setor Saneamento,&#13;
      PMSS). Over the lifetime of the project, Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s urban sanitation sector has undergone an institutional transformation and gained a repu-&#13;
      tation for innovative and pro-poor sewerage programs. In addition to this national policy component, the case study includes a regional&#13;
      project component that focuses on the Bahia Azul program, implemented by the state utility Empresa Bahiana de Ã?guas e Saneamento&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In 2010, the Water and Sanitation
            Program (WSP) undertook research on the political economy of
            sanitation in order to better support government and
            development partners in the design, implementation, and
            effectiveness of operations that aim to provide pro-poor
            sanitation investments and services to improve health and
            hygiene outcomes. This Research Brief summarizes the main
            findings of The Political Economy of Sanitation, a  WSP
            Technical Paper. Understanding and working with the
            political economy of sanitation of a country is necessary
            for increasing investments and reaching the rural and urban
            poor. Assessing stake holder interests, identifying
            potential winners and losers, identifying incentives, and
            examining formal and informal institutions provides a better
            understanding of the risks and opportunities associated with
            institutions and stakeholder interests in the sanitation
            sector. This knowledge can be used to better support more
            pro-poor sanitation investment.
