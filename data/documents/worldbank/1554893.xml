Abstract&#13;
Substantial social and economic progress in Sub-Saharan Africa during&#13;
the past 15 years has not altered the traditional regime of very high fertil-&#13;
ity. Explanations for this paradox have to turn to broad societal character-&#13;
istics not captured by multivariate analysis of the household level. The&#13;
search for physical survival promotes a very large family norm.     Righ fertil-&#13;
ity may also reflect the predicament of the African woman. The paper argues&#13;
that enough is known to provide a reliable basis for policies aimed at&#13;
reducing fertility. The case for such policies rests on evidence that the&#13;
challenge posed by accelerating population growth in Africa has not elicited a&#13;
commensurate response in the form of technological or organizational prog-&#13;
ress. Instead, growing population numbers have accentuated the food deficit,&#13;
magnified the budgetary problem of financing basic needs services and compli-&#13;
cated the employment issue.&#13;
The paper projects future population growth of nine sample countries,&#13;
accounting for two-thirds of Africa's total population, on the basis of four&#13;
sets of assumptions. These exercises confirm the desirability of action by&#13;
African governments to reduce fertility. Present population policies are weak&#13;
and attempts to strengthen them face formidable obstacles. Nevertheless, a&#13;
start can be made almost everywhere by defining programs which fit into the&#13;
prevailing cultural context. These programs have to evolve into broad&#13;
policies. The goal is not simply to deliver contraceptives through the health&#13;
network. What is required is a transformation of production and social&#13;
relationships and through these changes a major revolution in values that&#13;
determine desired family size.&#13;

Rapid Population Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa:   Issues and Policies&#13;
Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa continue to lag behind other developing&#13;
countries in the demographic transition from a regime of high mortality and&#13;
fertility to a regime in which death and birth rates stabilize at much lower&#13;
levels. The lag is a reflection of the relative underdevelopment of the&#13;
region, but that is not the whole story. Despite significant progress in&#13;
living standards, a substantial fall in mortality, impressive expansion in&#13;
education, and a measure of urbanization during the 1960s and 1970s, fertility&#13;
rates remain extraordinarily high in most Sub-Saharan countries. Furthermore,&#13;
the prospect of fertility reduction is not very bright during the 1980s or&#13;
1990s. The pace of economic and social development in Sub-Saharan Africa has&#13;
slowed down considerably, and the probability of an early revival is low.&#13;
This grim outlook means stagnation in per capita incomes, formidable&#13;
difficulties in sustaining or improving educational systems, and a setback in&#13;
health--conditions hardly propitious for initiating fertility declines. In&#13;
addition, many governments remain unconvinced of the desirability or&#13;
feasibility of population policies aimed at speeding up the transition to&#13;
lower birth rates.&#13;
In this paper, we first analyze the demographic scene in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa and compare it with conditions in other parts of the world. Second, we&#13;
bring out demographic differences among Sub-Saharan countries and try to&#13;
assess their impact. Projections for 1980-2020 of the total population, the&#13;
school-going population, and the working population for a sample of nine coun-&#13;
tries are attempted on the basis of alternative assumptions regarding&#13;
fertility and mortality. Third, the implications of rapid population growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for requirements of food, employment, and public expenditure on basic needs&#13;
are traced out. Fourth, the question of why fertility remains hîgh is raised&#13;
as a prelude to discussing the program and policy options that African&#13;
governments might consider.&#13;
The population of Kenya is now growîng at 4 percent a year, perhaps&#13;
the highest rate anywhere. This case was analyzed recently by Faruqee&#13;
(1980).  In the present paper, we will examine how far the Kenyan episode is&#13;
representative of conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
I. The Record&#13;
Expansion of GDP was moderate during the 1960s in many Sub-Saharan coun-&#13;
tries4 The average for the 45 countries of the region--4 percent a year--fell&#13;
far short of the experience of middle-income countries, but it was fully&#13;
comparable with achievements in low-income Asia (Table 1). These trends&#13;
continued to operate during the early and middle 1970s. It was only toward&#13;
the late 1970s that production suffered a setback in many Sub-Saharan coun-&#13;
tries, thereby lowering considerably the average growth rate for the 1970s as&#13;
a whole.&#13;
Major advances were made during the past two decades in the expansion&#13;
of schools, the access to safe water, and urbanization (Table 2)o Life&#13;
expectancy at birth rose on the average from 40 years in 1960 to 46 at the end&#13;
of the 1970so The one indicator that showed hardly any change during this&#13;
last twenty years was fertility: African birth rates remained at 47 per 1,000&#13;
(see annex table 1)o Economic and social progress has not altered the regime&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
of very high fertility. Inevitably, rates of population growth have risen&#13;
markedly as death rates declined but birth rates remained high (figure 1)o&#13;
To confirm this analysis, we will examine cross-sectîonal data for&#13;
the end of the 1970so Relationships will be identified between per capita&#13;
income and a number of variables, including fertility and several correlates&#13;
of fertility. The regressions suggest that fertility declines much more&#13;
slowly as per capita income rises in the sample of 42 countries în Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa than in the broader world sample of 83 countries (Figure 2)o The birth&#13;
rate falls by only 2 as per capita income rises from $100 to $800 in Sub-&#13;
Saharan countries . By contrast, the corresponding fall in the world sample&#13;
is 16 (table 3). Similarly, adult literacy in Africa is much less responsive&#13;
to increasing per capita income up to about the $400 level; subsequently, the&#13;
response is much more and beyond the $800 level, the literacy rate is higher&#13;
in Africa than in the world sample (Figure 7). These results are consistent&#13;
with Fig0 6 showing the very rapîd buîld-up in secondary school enrollments&#13;
and with Figure 5 portraying the explosîve rise in primary enroilments.&#13;
Urbanization rates remain consistently lower than in the world sample&#13;
(Fig0 4), except at very low levels of per capita income. We can conclude,&#13;
therefore, that the cross-sectional data for the late 1970s are consistent&#13;
with the trend data for the past two decades.&#13;
Let us now look at the Kenyan experience and see how it fits into the&#13;
above regional framework0 Its real GDP increased more than 6 percent a year&#13;
during 1960-79. Its per capita income in 1979 was well above the median for&#13;
Sub-Saharan countries (table 4). The same was true for life expectancy and&#13;
adult literacy. Only iith respect to the rate of urbanization was Kenya below&#13;

the median. It was also clear that Kenyan health (measured by lf e&#13;
expectancy) and education standards were far hîgher than expected from either&#13;
the Sub-Saharan or world regressions. Notwithstanding these achievements in&#13;
living standards and social servicesD Kenya had a birth rate of 51 per 1,000,&#13;
compared with a Sub-Saharan median of 48. And because Cenya's death rate had&#13;
already fallen to a relatively low 14, its rate of growth of population in&#13;
1979 was estimated at 3.7 percent a year. There is evidence that this rate&#13;
has climbed to the extraordinary 4 percent level since then (Faruqee, 1980)o&#13;
With its high fertility, Kenya remains in the initial stage of the&#13;
demographic transition. If we adopt 45 births per 1,000 as the critical&#13;
switching value separating the first and the second stages of the demographic&#13;
transition, 32 countries fall in the initial category (table 5). This large&#13;
category can be further decomposed into (12) countries that combine high&#13;
fertility and high mortality (crude death rate of more than 20 per 1,000)D&#13;
(17) countries whose mortality levels have fallen to intermediate levels and&#13;
(3) countries including Kenya, whose anomalous combination of high birth rates&#13;
and low death rates results in explosive demographic growth.&#13;
Stage II of the demographic transition has 12 cases with crude birth&#13;
rates ranging between 30 and 44. Only two countries in this category , Gabon&#13;
and South Africa, have birth rates below 40. If the crîtical swîtching value&#13;
separating Stages I and II is taken as 40, then Stage I would have 42 coun°&#13;
tries. Countries classified in Stage II in Table 5 may not reflect a signifiî&#13;
cantly different behaviour pattern, compared to those put under Stage I;&#13;
nevertheless they do show somewhat different demographic features as measured&#13;
by admittedly imperfect available data. Only three island mîniîstates,&#13;

with populations of less than a million in 1979, have entered stage III of the&#13;
demographic transition with birth rates below 30O&#13;
It is reasonable to conclude then, that most of Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
remains rooted in the initial stage of the demographic transition. Factors&#13;
that lower fertility have not yet taken hold, despite substantial declines in&#13;
mortality as in Kenya. In this sense, Kenya embodies the characteristic&#13;
ingredients of the African demographic dilemma. The question for the future&#13;
is whether countries on the left-hand side in table 5 will replicate the&#13;
demographic hîstory of Kenya and thereby experience very high rates of&#13;
population growth. And how long will these very high rates of growth persist&#13;
before fertility starts declining?&#13;
The changes of fertility and mortality in Asia and Sub-Saharan Afrîca&#13;
are shown in table 60 In such countries as Korea, Taîwan, and Sri Lanka, the&#13;
decline of fertility has more or less kept pace wîth that of mortality during&#13;
the last quarter century0 In India, mortality has fallen much more than&#13;
fertility, which nonetheless appears to be catching up in recent years. In&#13;
sharp contrast is the situation in Kenya and Zimbabwe, where fertîlity levels&#13;
remain high in the face of falling mortalityo&#13;

II. Prospects, 1980-2020&#13;
According to the World Development Report (1982)9 low-income oil-importing&#13;
countries of Africa succeeded in raising GDP at a rate of 4.0% per year during&#13;
the 1960so This expansion slowed down very considerably in the 1973-80&#13;
period; GDP rose at an annual rate of only 1.3% and per capita income declined&#13;
apprecîably. Middle-income oil-importing countries in Afrîca also witnessed&#13;
some setback in GDP expansion, although the extent of the retardation was much&#13;
less than for low-income countries. The future prospect for Africa, according&#13;
to this report, remains very poor; the Low Case projections, which is described&#13;
as the more likely one, visualizes a growth rate in GDP of 1.9% p.a. during&#13;
the 1980s for low-income and 2.8% p.a. for middle-income countries. The real-&#13;
istic scenario is a grim one with stagnant or declining per capita incomes in&#13;
many countries.&#13;
The grim prospects for per capita income growth in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
have many implications. First, it may not be possible to sustain the rapid&#13;
educational expansion experienced in the post-independence period. Education&#13;
typically accounts for 15-25 percent of the government's budgets and 3-6&#13;
percent of GNPO With slower expansion of GDP and budget revenues in recent&#13;
years, governments have been compelled to restrain outlays on education&#13;
(Gulhati and Datta forthcoming). Underfunding of schools has detracted from&#13;
the quality of education. Second, the health sector may suffer even more,&#13;
because health outlays have a comparatively larger component of foreign&#13;
exchange (drugs, equipment, energy-intensive transport), which has been very&#13;
scarce and is likely to remain scarce in many African economies. Thirdly,&#13;

slow income growth of the Sub-Saharan economies will also slow down the rurali&#13;
urban migration0 The modern urban wage sector will grow slowly, îf at all0&#13;
Most additions to the labor force wîll have to be absorbed by agriculture0&#13;
With this macro°economic p!cture as background, we made four differ-&#13;
ent population projections for nine Sub-Saharan countries. These countries&#13;
account for 225 million, iîe. 62% of the total population of Sub-Sahara Africa&#13;
(see tables 7 and 8, and annex tables 2-12)o All of these countries are ïn&#13;
Stage I of the demographic transition; Ethiopia represents a situation in&#13;
which both fertility and mortality are at very high levels; Nigeria, Sudan,&#13;
Zaire, Tanzania, Ghana and Ivory Coast represent a situation in which&#13;
mortality has fallen sharply; Kenya and Zimbabwe typify countries with even&#13;
lower levels of mortality.&#13;
The first projection makes assumptlons regarding fertîllty which are&#13;
very optimistic (Table 8)o They imply that the average crude bîrth rate for&#13;
the selected countries will decrease by nearly 45% over 35 years. This speed&#13;
of change is much more than can be expected reasonably. Our second projection&#13;
is the high variant of the UN population projections for these countries.&#13;
This high variant has less optîmistic assumption about fertility decline; thîs&#13;
projection implies that the crude birth rate will decline by about 25%o&#13;
Although some decline in fertiîity (based on the experience elsewhere) is not&#13;
unreasonable to assume, several Sub-Saharan countries have shown no sîgn of&#13;
decline, despite substantîal socioeconomîc progress. An assumption of no&#13;
change in fertility rates throughout the total projection perîod 1s not&#13;
implausible. Our third projection assumes that total fertïlity rates ln these&#13;
countries wîll remain constant at the level estîmated for the perlod 1980-850&#13;

These three projections assume a similar trend in mortality - average&#13;
crude death rate, starting at around 23 in 1980-85 declining to around 11 in&#13;
2015-2020 (see table 8). This assumption is based on the observed trend of&#13;
mortality in these countries and consistent with the experience of other&#13;
developing countries. These projections illustrate the effect of alternative&#13;
fertility rates, without varying mortality assumptions. But fertility and&#13;
mortality are interrelated. If fertility remains constant at the current&#13;
level, mortality conditions may not improve in the same way as in the past.&#13;
Stagnation in income projected for Africa may slow down the pace of progress&#13;
in health and life expectancy. We, therefore, made the fourth projection in&#13;
which fertility remains constant and mortality improves only slightly. Figure&#13;
8 charts the total population of these 9 countries. The value of this exer-&#13;
cise is that it illustrates the implications of the underlying assumptions.&#13;
The four projections do not differ materially till 1995. In the year 2000,&#13;
the combined population would be 442 million based on constant fertility or as&#13;
low as 416 million, according to the low fertility projection. The differ-&#13;
ences mount as we move towards the terminal year 2020. The annual growth rate&#13;
of population would decline from 3.1% during 1980-2000 to 2.4% in 2000-2020 on&#13;
the basis of the low fertility projection but it would rise from 3.4% to more&#13;
than 3.9% if fertility remained constant.    Highest growth rates under the&#13;
latter projection would be encountered during 2000-2020 in Kenya (4.9% p.a.),&#13;
Zimbabwe (4.1% p.a.) and Nigeria (4.1% p.a.) (see Annex Table 2).&#13;
The projection results bring out the dramatic impact of the lagged&#13;
effects of past high fertility. Because of this history, the number of women&#13;
in the reproductive age group will expand by an average of 91% during 1980-&#13;
2000, irrespective of the assumption we make regarding the course of future&#13;

fertility. This growth momentum is now built into the demographîc structure&#13;
and its consequences will blunt the impact of any future decline în&#13;
fertility. Even in the subsequent two decades 2000-2020, the number of women&#13;
in the reproductive age group will rise by 75% under the low fertîlity projec-&#13;
tion, compared to an increase in the total population of 60O%&#13;

III. Consequences of Rapid Population Growth&#13;
The decade of the 1970s witnessed a major deceleration in the rate of growth&#13;
of African production and a significant acceleration in the pace of its popu-&#13;
lation increase. Are these two trends causally related? This question is not&#13;
easy to answer despite the existence of a vast literature on the connection&#13;
between population and economic development. Many factors, tncluding policy,&#13;
influence the speed and pattern of economic growth. Population is only one of&#13;
these factors and it is very difficult to isolate its impact from that of all&#13;
other influences at work.   It would be difficult to maintain, nevertheless,&#13;
that the acceleration of population growth in the 1970s has been a positive&#13;
influence on African economic change. On the contrary, we conclude that&#13;
rapidly expanding population has greatly complicated the inherently difficult&#13;
task of securing rapid economic progress in Africa.&#13;
The Food Issue&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world where per capita&#13;
food production declined over the past twenty years (Figure 9). Only a&#13;
handful of countries--Burundi, Ivory Coast, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia--&#13;
held or improved upon the per capita production achieved in the early 1960s.&#13;
All other countries showed a moderate or severe decline. In Angola, Ethiopia,&#13;
Ghana, Niger, Uganda, and Upper Volta, per capita production in 1978 was less&#13;
than 80 percent of their earlier record. Total food production during 1970-77&#13;
grew at an average annual rate of only 1.1 percent in Western Africa, 1.0&#13;
percent in Central Africa, and 1.9 percent in Eastern and Southern Africa; the&#13;
corresponding figures for the growth of population were 2.6, 2.3 and 2.8&#13;
percent (FAO, 1978). The volume of cereal imports increased by 9.5 percent&#13;
per year in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s (World Bank, 1981).&#13;

It would be wrong to attribute the growing food deficit of Africa to&#13;
population pressures per se. Only 5 percent of the total land area of the&#13;
continent is now cultivated. 1/ Buringh et. al. (1977) estimates that 24&#13;
percent of the total land area is potentially cultivable. 1/ The land&#13;
frontier in this sense is much further away in Africa than in Asia (where 16&#13;
percent of total area is now cultivated as against a potential cultivable area&#13;
of 20 percent). Furthermore, average yields of staple crops are very low in&#13;
Sub-Sahara Africa compared to those in Asia and Latin America (Figure 10).&#13;
This is the case in roots and tubers, cereals and pulses. While Asian yields&#13;
have shown an appreciable upward trend during the 1965-1980 period, particu-&#13;
larly in the case of cereals and pulses, the African picture is one of&#13;
stagnation.&#13;
Lack of progress in tapping the African agricultural potential is the&#13;
result of factors such as&#13;
(i)    unavailability of technical packages suitable for local&#13;
agronomic conditions;&#13;
(ii)    acute shortage of professional and administrative skills&#13;
required for operating delivery systems for agricultural&#13;
extension, credit and marketing;&#13;
(iii)    weakness of tax, exchange rate, price and marketing policies&#13;
bearing on producer incentives and consumption patterns and&#13;
1/ These figures apply to the entire continent, including North Africa. A&#13;
large part of North Africa is the Sahara desert (more than one-quarter of&#13;
the entire African area) which is not potentially cultivable. Correspond-&#13;
ing approximate figures for Sub-Sahara Africa would be 6 percent for&#13;
presently cultivated area and 33 percent for potentially cultivated area.&#13;

substantial changes.&#13;
We must conclude, therefore, that the population problem in Sub-Sahara Africa&#13;
is manifest not in the form of land unavailability and visible overcrowding&#13;
but in much more subtle ways. Accommodation of rapid population growth&#13;
requires massive improvements in the food and larger agricultural sector&#13;
involving not only substantial public investment outlays in developing land&#13;
and improving its productivity but also in building transport networks and&#13;
other infrastructure. In fact, African agricultural development strategy must&#13;
find solutions to a whole variety of policy, technological, institutional and&#13;
organizational issues. While these solutions can yield a large pay-off over&#13;
the long-run, they may prove to be quite expensive in the immediate future in&#13;
terms of demands on decision-making and socio-political dislocation.&#13;
In this context, we should note that, while Sub-Saharan Africa has&#13;
plenty of cultivable land, only a small part of it can be reclaimed at low&#13;
cost. The top part of Table 9 shows that only 13 percent of the potential&#13;
cultivable land can be developed at a cost of about $200 per ha (in prices of&#13;
1977). Undoubtedly, much of this category I land is already under crops. In&#13;
ascending order of costs, the next two categories account for 63 percent of&#13;
the total. The exploitation of the remaining land (Categories IV and V) will&#13;
involve very high costs (perhaps $2000 per ha or more) on account of one or&#13;
more of the following operations: clearing dense vegetation, soil conserva-&#13;
tion works, drainage.&#13;
Another qualification to the picture of land-abundant Africa should&#13;
be introduced at this juncture. Less than 20% of the land has sufficient&#13;

rainfall to secure a relatively high yield under a regime of "labour-oriented&#13;
agriculture" assumed by Buringh (see the lower part of Table 9). This regime&#13;
implies fairly advanced farm management but very little mechanization,&#13;
pesticides or chemical fertilizers. The proportion of land which can support&#13;
such high yields in Asia is very much higher than in Africa. By contrast,&#13;
category III land which can secure yields, which are only 44 percent of those&#13;
obtaining in Category I, accounts for 41 percent of the total in Africa.&#13;
Agricultural land has already become scarce in some countries.&#13;
Examples are Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi and Mauritius. In these cases,&#13;
the scope for horizontal expansion via extending the margin of cultivation is&#13;
limited and the burden of increasing food output falls much more heavily on&#13;
technological improvements as well as on creating a policy-cum-institutional&#13;
setting within which technical advances can be adopted speedily by farmers.&#13;
In the absence of such a progressive environment, population pressure causes&#13;
serious injury. This can be illustrated by the prevailing situation in&#13;
Kenya. First, as Mbithi and Barnes (1975) have shown, part of the low, dry&#13;
marginal land is becoming arid because squatter migrants are destroying&#13;
forests and using poor farming techniques. If squatters stay more than three&#13;
years on marginal land, using improper techniques of cultivation, the results&#13;
are often well nigh irreversible. In addition, the concentration of popula-&#13;
tion depletes valuable water catchments, upsetting the equilibrium between&#13;
land use and land capacity. Second, even on better land, excessive fragmenta-&#13;
tion can lead to a loss of output--a fact made clear by data from settlement&#13;
schemes. On some Kenyan farms held by groups of cooperatives, members have&#13;
unofficially divided the land among themselves. As a result, output has been&#13;
lower than it would have been under more efficient management or more rational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 &#13;
distribution. This problem is acute in the Haraka settlement scheme, where&#13;
each family is given a small farm (five to seven acres) on the condition that&#13;
the children will seek their livelihood elsewhere when they become adults. In&#13;
practice, the children do not go elsewhere, and the land is parceled out among&#13;
them. As the size of farms gradually declines, the loss of productivity&#13;
follows.&#13;
Population pressure in land-scarce countries has also manifested&#13;
itself in the growing scarcity of fuelwood. With increasing needs of cropland&#13;
(to meet the growing needs of rapid population growth)9 forests have been&#13;
reduced and, therefore, the availability of fuelwood has become more and more&#13;
limited. Lester Brown (1981) has noted that Africa has only 6 percent of its&#13;
land in closed forest (with more than 20 percent tree cover) - as against 15&#13;
percent in Asia and 33 percent in Latin America. A series of country studies&#13;
on energy indicate that nearly nine--tenths of the people in the Sub-Saharan&#13;
countries depend on firewood as the chief source of fuel. 1/ In most of these&#13;
countries population growth is outstripping the growth of new trees, and as a&#13;
result there is a trend towards deforestation which threatens the whole&#13;
ecological system9 specially the fertility and stability of tropical soils&#13;
(Lester Brown 1978)o&#13;
The Employment Issue&#13;
The labour force expanded during the 1960s and 1970s at a rate of&#13;
roughly 2% per year on average in Sub-Saharan countries. In Kenya and&#13;

Coast the very high rise in the labour force was greatly influenced by inflows&#13;
of workers from neighbouring countries. Labour productivity rose in most&#13;
countries. It fell in Zimbabwe, Ghana and Zaire, however; expansion in GDP&#13;
failed to keep pace with the increase in the labour force0&#13;
As in other LDCs, African labour productivity in 1960 ijas far below&#13;
that in industrialized countries. This reflected both technological&#13;
backwardness and a relatively low stock of capital. Investment in 1960 was,&#13;
on average, 15% of a relatively low GDPo The volume of investment expanded by&#13;
about 5.7% per annum during the 1960s, thereby raising the capital stock in&#13;
relation to the labour force. The pace of capital accumulation slowed down to&#13;
3.2% p.a. during the 1970s9 while labour force continued to rise at the&#13;
earlier rate. Capital per worker failed to rise as rapidly as in the earlier&#13;
decade and in some cases, an absolute decline could have occurred. Table 10&#13;
shows such a decline in the Sudan, Ethiopia and possibly in Tanzania.&#13;
In 1960, the bulk of the labour force (about 80%) was în agriculture&#13;
and consisted very largely of small farmers using low technology and very&#13;
little capital0 Only 10% of the workers were urban and a very small part of&#13;
these were employed in the formal wage sector (i.e. government establishments&#13;
and businesses using high technology and substantial capital)0 The rest of&#13;
urban workers were engaged in informal pursuits (i.e. small enterprises and&#13;
the self-employed). There was not one unified labour market but several&#13;
partially connected sub-markets. The urban labour force expanded much more&#13;
rapidly than the total in all countries of Africa; the average urban growth&#13;
rate being about 6% p.a. The urbanization rate was high but starting from a&#13;
low base0 A large part of the increasing labour force was accommodated within&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
the low productivity, small farmer sector in most African countries while a&#13;
small part found highly paid jobs within the modern sector.&#13;
We can illustrate this rough, impressionistic sketch by citing the&#13;
Kenyan case. There, the labour force increased by 1.6 million during 1968-&#13;
78. More than half of this increment was absorbed in residual rural areas as&#13;
small farmers, pastoralists, migrant farmers and landless workers. About a&#13;
third of the rural population was below the poverty line; the corresponding&#13;
proportion for urban areas being 4% (Collier and Lal 1980). About a fifth of&#13;
the new workers found high paid jobs in the modern sector and the rest made&#13;
their livelihood in the informal sector. Much of this period was favorable&#13;
for the Kenyan economy and aggregate GDP expanded rapidly. Furthermore,&#13;
government was deliberately reducing real wages through its policy of partial&#13;
compensation (75%) of the rise in the cost of living. This combination of an&#13;
expansionary climate and effective wage restraint made it possible to expand&#13;
high paid modern sector jobs by about 4% p.a. Also, government's initiative&#13;
in expanding public education led directly to a very large increase in the&#13;
number of teachers.&#13;
Conditions for growth in high paid modern sector jobs were much less&#13;
favorable in many other African countries than in Kenya. Aggregate GDP growth&#13;
was much smaller than in Kenya in many cases (Table 10). Reduction of real&#13;
wages was not a favored policy in Africa; on the contrary, the emphasis in&#13;
many cases was to raise minimum wages and to install social welfare legisla-&#13;
tion. Given these trends, it is quite likely that a much smaller portion of&#13;
the growing labour force than in Kenya could be accommodated in the high paid&#13;
wage sectors of many African countries. And since agriculture tended to be a&#13;
neglected, slow-growth sector in many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, it was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36 -&#13;
likely that the growth in the labour force dependent on farming was accompa-&#13;
nied by underemployment, stagnant household încomes and, possibly, declining&#13;
per capita incomes in some cases. The end of the 1970s and early 1980s saw a&#13;
widespread tendency for economic growth to slow down. This retardation must&#13;
have reduced the number of job openings in the formal urban sector. Many&#13;
governments have tried to protect their own labour force by keeping workers on&#13;
the rolls, even when cutbacks in government expenditure for other purposes&#13;
have been severe. Obviously, this response cannot be sustained indefinitely.&#13;
The phenomenon of rural underemployment is difficult, to defîne and&#13;
even more difficult to measure in Afrîca, as elsewhere. A specîal problem ls&#13;
that under rainfed conditions, typical of African agriculture, the demand for&#13;
labour is subject to sharp peaks and troughs. Labour is very scarce at the&#13;
time of planting and harvesting; in fact, for most small=holders, labour îs&#13;
the binding constraint on the amount of land farmed and on the cropping&#13;
pattern. The labour market is fragmented; small-holders rely almost wholly on&#13;
family workers and there is scarcely any wage employment. Seasonal peaks&#13;
coexist with a condition of labour surplus, taking the whole year under&#13;
consideration. Some evidence along these lines is cited by Cleave (1974),&#13;
based on 50 field surveys in 10 countries. According to these data, the&#13;
averge time spent in the field is only 1000 hours per adult, per year. Women&#13;
spend another 3-4 hours per day in food preparatîon, cooking and the collec-&#13;
tion of firewood and water. The same point is made by Mbilinyî (forthcomîng);&#13;
she quotes a number of studîes to emphasize the 'double day' phenomenon for&#13;
rural African women. In the absence of attractive încome-earning opportuni&#13;
ties durîng the long, slack season, men farmers spend sîgnifîcant amounts of&#13;
time drinking beer or local brews and visiting friends and relatives0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
These impressions of labour surplus are confirmed by a unique data&#13;
set assembled for Botswana which shows the use of time by all individuals in a&#13;
household above the age of six. Mueller (1981) concludes her analysis of this&#13;
data by stating that substantial surplus labour exists in rural Botswana.&#13;
Adult males tend to record very high leisure time; they work 60% longer in the&#13;
busy season than in the slack season; they work 33% longer in the commercial&#13;
Baralong farms (area with progressive, high technology production) than in&#13;
other areas.&#13;
A marked acceleration in the growth of the labour force is in the&#13;
cards (see Figure 11). Compared to 2.1 percent per year average increase&#13;
during the 1970s, our sample of 9 countries will see the growth rate climb to&#13;
3.3 percent during 1980-2000. The highest growth rates in the labour force&#13;
will be experienced in Kenya (4.2 percent p.a.) and in Zimbabwe (3.6 percent&#13;
p.a.). Those who will join the labour force during these two decades are&#13;
already born. How can these new recruits be deployed effectively? Such&#13;
expansion, unprecedented by historical standards, will require major depar-&#13;
tures from ongoing policies and institutional structures; a revival of agri-&#13;
culture, high doses of investment, elimination of urban wage and other price&#13;
distortions, reformulation of technologically unsuitable government standards&#13;
and a whole host of other changes. If African development policy fails to&#13;
respond to these challenges, the rapidly growing labour force can become a&#13;
source of instability and demoralization.&#13;
What happens to the labour force in the 21st century is much more&#13;
open. If fertility remains constant during the next 20 years, then growth in&#13;
the labour force will gain speed and, during 2000-2020, the average annual&#13;

rate for the sample will rise further to 3.8 percent. On the other hand, the&#13;
low fertility projection implies a turnaround in the growth of the labour&#13;
force; from 3.3 percent p.a. during 1980-2000 to 3.2 percent p.a. during the&#13;
following two decades. Depending on how Africa decides on its fertility, the&#13;
total labour force of the nine country sample in 2020 could be anywhere&#13;
between 304 million and 345 million. A larger labour force can be an asset if&#13;
it is well educated and trained, if it is healthy and if it can be equipped&#13;
fully with capital equipment and infrastructure. Given the present predica-&#13;
ment of African countries, the constraints on the availability of finance and&#13;
management and formidable obstacles in the way of policy-cum institutional&#13;
reform, a larger labour force can also turn out to be a liability.&#13;
Services for Basic Needs&#13;
Despite considerable progress in the provision of basic needs in&#13;
recent years, the situation is still unsatisfactory (see annex table 13). The&#13;
coverage of primary education has risen to an average of 70 percent but that&#13;
of secondary education remains very low at 9 percent. Improved water supply&#13;
is only available to 20 percent of the population. Infant and child mortality&#13;
remain at fairly high levels. Population growth adds the serious problem of&#13;
"keeping up" the quantity and quality of the existing coverage to the already&#13;
serious problem of "catching up."&#13;
The primary school-age population in our sample of 9 countries&#13;
increased at a rate of 3 percent p.a. during the 1960s and at 3.6 percent p.a.&#13;
during the 1970s. If fertility is unchanged, we can expect this rate of&#13;
increase to continue during the next 20 years and then accelerate further to&#13;
4.1 percent p.a. during 2000-2020 (Figure 12 and Annex Table 16). By&#13;

contrast, the growth in the primary school-age population will slow down to&#13;
3.4 percent p.a. during 1980-2000 and further to 1.3 percent p.a. during the&#13;
following two decades, according to projections based on low fertility.&#13;
Universal primary education implies increasing the number of primary school&#13;
places from about 34 million in 1980 to 124 million in 2020 under the low&#13;
fertility regime. But this order of expansion in primary school places will&#13;
only accommodate 56 percent of the primary school age population if fertility&#13;
levels remain unchanged. This is quite a dramatic conclusion. Expanding&#13;
primary school places by 3.6 times during 1980-2020 will suffice to make such&#13;
education universal under the low fertility projections; the same effort will&#13;
lead to an unconscionable fall in the enrollment ratio from 70 percent to 56&#13;
percent under the constant fertility projection.&#13;
The arithmetic of Basic Needs can be presented in another way using&#13;
Kenyan data. During 1975-80, Kenya spent 32% of total government expenditures&#13;
(10% of GDP) on education, health, rural water supply and urban housing. If&#13;
we assume constant fertility, Kenya will have to expand these outlays in real&#13;
terms by 878% in the period up to 2015-2020 to maintain present coverage and&#13;
quality (Faruqee 1980). By contrast, the required expansion would be only&#13;
269% if fertility declined rapidly as per Projection I in this paper (Annex&#13;
Table 3), thereby freeing up substantial resources with which Kenya can&#13;
improve the coverage and quality of these services.&#13;
To recapitulate, past trends in Sub-Saharan Africa are worrying,&#13;
irrespective of whether the focus is on food output, employment conditions,&#13;
provision of basic needs or general development. This difficult situation is&#13;
the result of many different factors. It is not easy to assign weights to&#13;
each factor even in the context of a single country, to say nothing about the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
hazards of generalizations at the Pan-Afrîcan level. It would be difficult to&#13;
maintain, nevertheless, that the acceleration of population growth in the&#13;
1970s has been a positive influence on such halting progress as has&#13;
occurred. The challenge posed by rapid growth in numbers has not, in fact ,&#13;
led to a commensurate response in the form of technological or organizatio-nal&#13;
progress as hypothesized by Boserup (1965) or Simon (1982)o A sizeable part&#13;
of government expenditure has been diverted to the task of "keeping up"i per&#13;
capita standards instead of extending the coverage of basic needs services and&#13;
improving their quality. Again, a substantial part of investment and imports&#13;
have been directed to equipping additions to the labor force with a minimal&#13;
allotment of equipment and inputs instead of raising per worker allotments.&#13;
Looking to the future, we have argued that rapid population growth in the near&#13;
term is inevitable given the demographic momentum already built up. Further&#13;
on in time, the room for maneuver expands and there is an important choice to&#13;
be made regarding the course of fertility. The scale and complexity of the&#13;
development problem facing Africa will be influenced by the future behavior of&#13;
fertility. If this begins to fall in the coming decades, the development task&#13;
of the next generation will be facilitated to some considerable extent. A&#13;
slower growth in population numbers should provide more breathing space. It&#13;
should reduce , somewhat, the trend rate of expansion in food demand, thereby&#13;
facilitating the attainment of self-sufficiency and moderating pressures on&#13;
the balance of payments. A reduction in population growth should also relieve&#13;
the pressure on government budgets, thereby permitting faster expansion in&#13;
coverage and quality of basic needs services. The result will be a better&#13;
educated population who are in better health and who can make a bigger&#13;
contribution to production. The accumulation of human capital (in the form of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
health and education) is also regarded as a major factor determining attitudes&#13;
and values favorable to the reduction of fertility (Cassen, 1976). Finally, a&#13;
slowing down in population numbers should reduce the inflow of entrants into&#13;
the labour force but improve the quality (in terms of skills and attitudes) of&#13;
each new worker. It should permit a faster increase in the amount of physical&#13;
capital with which new workers can begin production. The economies of Africa&#13;
will, then, have a better prospect of generating attractive earning&#13;
opportunities in sufficient number to engage the growing labour force.&#13;
The above propositions constitute the case for reducing the pace of&#13;
demographic expansion in Africa. If this case is persuasive and forceful&#13;
action is taken to reduce fertility, population will still grow at a rapid&#13;
pace, albeit not as rapid as it would on the assumption of constant fertility&#13;
(Table 7). In stating this case for fertility restraint, we do not wish to&#13;
minimize the inherent difficulties of the development task in Africa, no&#13;
matter what happens to fertility. Clearly, effective population policies are&#13;
a desirable part of the overall approach to development but they are not a&#13;
panacea.&#13;

region than in other parts of the world    'l'hese trends were dccumented in&#13;
Section Io&#13;
There is a wide variation in fertîlity rates in the Su -'Saharan coun-&#13;
tries. The fertility data for most oL- these countries are not dL-nendable; the&#13;
figures should be interpreted as ranges (Hill 1981). Trhe estimated total&#13;

rates of at least 6.3, with several countries above 7. By conc-cast, Western&#13;
and Central Africa have only one country, Ghanea Dit/it  a total fezrtlility rate&#13;
of 7; several are below 60 The sîgnificance of this broad regional difference&#13;
fades in the light of the dates of these estimates     HIost of tne data for&#13;
Western and Central Africa are from the 1950s anci 1960s; those For the Eastern&#13;
and Southern Africa are much more recent. Nore recent data fo-e Western and&#13;
Central Africa may confirm the rising trend of fertility revea½eci in Kenya.&#13;
There is strong evidence t'nat the low fertillity observed in some&#13;
areas in the 1950s and early 1960s was largely caused by the abortifacient and&#13;
sterilizing effects of venereal diseases (Romaniuk 1967; Miobogunje and Arowolo&#13;
1978)o There is also some evidence that other diseasesD such as malaria,&#13;

few areas indicates that fertility in those areas will rise with the introduc-&#13;
tion of antibiotic therapy and improved nutrition.&#13;
Of the Sub-Saharan countries, Kenya has the most reliable data on&#13;
fertility for different years, which make it possible to study both its level&#13;
and trend. Annex table 17 presents the data on fertility in Kenya; annex&#13;
table 18 that for other Sub-Saharan countries. The main features of Kenya's&#13;
fertility are that it is high, has been high in the past, and appears to be&#13;
increasing at present. In 1978 Kenya's total fertility rate was estimated at&#13;
8. According to the U.N. (1975), no other country has such a high rate.&#13;
The similarities between the fertility rates of Kenya and those of&#13;
other Sub-Saharan African countries are obvious - fertility has either&#13;
remained constant at a high level or has recently increased. A recent review&#13;
of World Fertility Survey (WFS) findings in 29 developing countries shows that&#13;
fertility levels are highest in Africa, where the average TFR is 6.7 compared&#13;
to average TFR of 4.8 in Asia and Pacific countries and 4.6 in Latin America&#13;
(Lightbourne et al 1982). The average number children desired is 7.1, in&#13;
Africa, compared to 4.0 in Asia and Pacific countries and 4.3 in Latin America&#13;
(see table 11).&#13;
How can this be explained? Why has fertility remained high, or in&#13;
some cases even risen, in the face of rising education, falling mortality, and&#13;
some urbanization, factors that caused fertility to decline in others parts of&#13;
the world? Why is preferred family size universally so high in Africa? What&#13;
factors explain high fertility and preference for large families? Are the&#13;
fertility determinants in Africa different from those in other parts of the&#13;
world?&#13;

Studies of fertility differentials within countries are very scarce&#13;
but the limited evidence suggests that fertility behavior in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa does not differ too much from that observed elsewhere.     The results of&#13;
the multivariate analysis in Kenya show that the following variables are&#13;
significantly related to fertility: wife's education (negative), husband's&#13;
education (positive), urban residence (negative), and the amount of land owned&#13;
(positive) (Faruqee 1980). A significant, negative relation between wife's&#13;
education and fertility appears after junior-secondary education, which can be&#13;
regarded as a threshold of fertility decline. It is likely that this&#13;
threshold moved downward as primary education spread throughout the popula-&#13;
tion. Information obtained through the World Fertility Survey in 1977 showed&#13;
that the number of children desired by Kenyan women dropped from 7.8 for those&#13;
without any education to 6.8 for those with primary education to 5.6 for&#13;
secondary school graduates (Kent and Larson 1982). The relevance of wife's&#13;
education is also borne out in other studies for tropical Africa (Ward 1976),&#13;
Ghana (Caldwell 1967a and 1969b), Botswana (Chernichovsky 1981), Nigeria&#13;
(Ohadike 1968b), and Sierra Leone (Dow 1971). The Kenya study by Faruqee also&#13;
found a negative relation between urban residence and fertility. A similar&#13;
finding has been recorded for Sierra Leone by Dow (1971). Cohen (1967)&#13;
classified Mali, Guinea, and Togo as countries with significantly lower&#13;
fertility rates in urban areas than in rural areas.&#13;
Explanations of continued high fertility in Africa have to turn to&#13;
broad societal characteristics not captured by multivariate analysis at the&#13;
houehold level. In fact, the household may be quite unsuitable as a unit of&#13;
analysis, specially in Africa. This point has been made once again by Jane&#13;
Guyer in a long 'state of the art' paper commissioned by the African Studies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Association (Guyer 1981). The household tends not to be a very meaningful&#13;
unit for production, consumption or fertility decisions. There may be no&#13;
common budget for a man and his wife. The head of the household may not have&#13;
full control over the labour supply of îndividual members. Chîldren may have&#13;
very different implications in terms of costs and benefits, for fathers and&#13;
mothers. These aspects compel the analyst to focus on individual members of&#13;
the household; the distribution of income, power, work and leisure .Iîthin the&#13;
family acquire a great deal of signîficance. Equally, it may be necessary to&#13;
focus on units larger than households, such as kinship, lineage and tribe.&#13;
The values, structure and functioning of these social groups may exercise&#13;
important influence on îndividual and household behavior, including fertility&#13;
behavior.&#13;
Based on a study of available social-anthropologîcal and other&#13;
literature, we wish to put forward two workîng hypotheses. The first is that&#13;
the security motive (i.e. search for physical survival of family, clan and&#13;
tribe) makes for a larger ideal family size in Africa. Some support for this&#13;
hypothesis can be found in the notion that large numbers in a family or clan&#13;
may be the only guarantee of securîty în fragmented, traditional societies&#13;
where governments have not yet established the protective cover via the rule&#13;
of law enforced effectively by a mobile, non-partisan, police force. The&#13;
writings of Caldwell are suggestive on this score.&#13;
According to Caldwell (1977), there are only two types of fertility&#13;
regime: one where there is no economic gain to individuals from restricting&#13;
fertility; and the other where there is substantial economic gain from such&#13;
restriction. Whether unrestricted or restrîcted fertility is economically&#13;
rational is determined by social conditions, primarily by the direction of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
intergenerational wealth flow. According to Caldwell, this flow has been from&#13;
younger to older generations in all traditional societies. Only after the&#13;
family is largely nucleated both emotionally and economically is there a&#13;
reversal of flow.   Caldwell holds that the African society by and large, is in&#13;
the first regime, implying that most parents, especially women, do not find it&#13;
gainful to restrict fertility. In describing the characteristics of tradi-&#13;
tional societies, Caldwell remarks that if larger organizational units have&#13;
not arisen, as among warring clans, and even families, numbers are presumably&#13;
almost the only guarantee of security from attack and of the ability to take&#13;
resources from others. In this sense, African societies with many clans and&#13;
tribes, often in conflict with each other, may have strengthened the norm for&#13;
unrestricted fertility. In another recent article, Caldwell (1981) further&#13;
elaborates his observation. He writes:&#13;
"Sub-Saharan Africa has been characterized by strong&#13;
descent lineages and by weak conjugal bonds. Land is&#13;
most frequently communally owned, and hence power and&#13;
fortune have been derived almost solely from the control&#13;
of sufficient people. Children have by no means been&#13;
brought up solely by the nuclear family, and fertility&#13;
determines neither the number of economic dependents at&#13;
any specific time nor the identity of the person meeting&#13;
the costs of rearing a child."&#13;
The second hypothesis is that high fertility in Africa reflects the&#13;
predicament of women. This line of argument draws on a variety of historical,&#13;
economic and social-anthropological sources but we have not seen it spelt out&#13;
fully. Evidence (sometimes fragmentary) can be cited in support of individual&#13;
elements in this chain of reasoning, but other elements are no more than&#13;
suggestive. The validation of this hypothesis will require a new round of&#13;
inter-disciplinary research. Notwithstanding its speculative nature, we&#13;
present the argument here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50 -&#13;
First, we will describe the position of African women in the pre-&#13;
colonial period. They were responsible for most domestic work in cooking,&#13;
cleaning, child-rearing9 collection of water and fuel wood; much like women&#13;
everywhere at that point in history. The distinctive aspect of African women&#13;
was that they played a dominating role in agriculture. Boserup (1970) tied&#13;
this fact to several structural aspects of farming; its concentration on&#13;
subsistence food crops, the low density of population, the widespread practice&#13;
of shifting cultivation and low technology. Women in Africa carried out half&#13;
of the agricultural work and, in some cases9 much more; the corresponding&#13;
Asian proportion being 20%.&#13;
The introduction of cash crops during the colonial period had a&#13;
number of repercussions in African agriculture and in African society. While&#13;
men had left the growing of subsistence food to women, they did not shy away&#13;
from cultivating export crops. Men had much more time to respond to the new&#13;
profit opportunities; women after all were preoccupied with traditional9&#13;
reproductive9 child-rearing and food-growing activities. In addition9&#13;
European colonial policy neither understood9 nor accepted the prevailing&#13;
female-farming system in Africa. Subsistence food crops were largely&#13;
neglected by research, extension and infrastructure services provided by the&#13;
colonial state. An attempt was made to recruit males for wage-jobs in&#13;
European plantations9 to educate them and to get them to grow cash crops on&#13;
their small-farms for export to Europe. The result was a growing gap in&#13;
labour productivity as between food and cash crops or (in other words) between&#13;
women and men farmers. Men acquired the cash to upgrade the cultivation of&#13;
export crops while women continued to use traditional, low-input, low-yield&#13;
methods for food production. These trends led to a deterioration in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
relative position of women. On the one hand, there took place an increase in&#13;
their already considerable workload (Safilios-Rothschild 1980). In addition&#13;
to domestic work, child-rearing and food-growing, women were expected to work&#13;
on cash crops. They were also expected to take over male functions when&#13;
husbands left to earn wages in the modern sector or when sons went off to&#13;
attend school. On the other hand, women tended to become more dependent on&#13;
men. The best lands and household labour were diverted to cash crops. Women&#13;
remained responsible for food but failed to produce enough on the farm;&#13;
supplements had to be purchased by them financed by men's cash earnings.&#13;
Damage done to the relative position of women during the colonial&#13;
period was not offset during the last two decades of independent socio-&#13;
economic development (Mbilinyi, forthcoming). This latter period was marked&#13;
by a tendency for the entire agricultural growth (cash crops and food crops)&#13;
to slow down, particularly during the mid and late 1970s, as the internal&#13;
terms of trade moved in favour of cities and as waves of rural men left to&#13;
find city jobs. More and more houseolds came to be headed by women.&#13;
Botswana, with its large number of male workers working in South Af rica mines,&#13;
is perhaps an extreme case of what is common in many African countries--male&#13;
migration from rural areas. Kossoudji and Mueller (1981) found that nearly 41&#13;
percent of rural households surveyed had a female head. And despite the&#13;
increasing responsibility of women, their position has not improved in&#13;
society, according to the study. Economically, the female-headed households&#13;
generally are poorer than male-headed households. Socially, women are still&#13;
given lower status than men: for example, in Botswana women are regarded as&#13;
minors both in law and in actual behaviour. The situation of rural women in&#13;
Lesotho is similar to that in Botswana. Many male workers move to South&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Africa for work; women are left with household responsibilities and agricul&#13;
tural tasks0 A survey found that two of three workers in the agricultural&#13;
fields were women. Males still play a dominant role in family decisions9&#13;
including those about agriculture. Even an absent, migrant, maie decides on&#13;
the use of land when on home visits. If the husband is absent, the wife has&#13;
to obtain his agreement before starting a farming operation, employing a&#13;
contractor sharecropper, or getting a loan from the local credit union.&#13;
Faruqee's Kenya study also underlines the low status of women. There&#13;
is strong social pressure on women to marry and produce children, thus extend°&#13;
ing the kinship network. An intense desire is created for family roles by&#13;
community praise of the wife and mother and severe censure of the unmarried or&#13;
childless woman. Most Kenyan women, therefore, marry at the onset of puberty;&#13;
feelings of dependence underlie a woman's relationship with her husband and&#13;
his friends, placing her in a position of near-zero power in the family into&#13;
which she marries. The low status of Kenyan women has a big effect on their&#13;
decisions about family size, their knowledge of bîrth control, and their&#13;
access to contraceptives. The nature of legal rights and the obligations of&#13;
couples toward each other and their children also affect decîsions about&#13;
family size. Available information indicates that the heavy workload of&#13;
Kenyan rural women induces them to have children, who are looked on as&#13;
potential sources of labor and support0 In Kenya, nearly one quarter of the&#13;
rural households are headed by females, whose economic situations is worse&#13;
than that of male-headed households, as in Botswana. Absence of husband makes&#13;
these women dependent on children for security and this is reflected in the&#13;
desire to have many children. The current rule regarding property rights of&#13;
women also makes them economically dependent on their children0 Through a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
system of kinship ties, holdings are generally transmitted from one generation&#13;
to another. Women in Kenya do not normally inherit land; rather they are&#13;
granted the right to use land belonging to their husbands or father or in some&#13;
instances sons. This means women lack security of tenure and want children,&#13;
especially sons, for security. Matiko (1981) makes a similar observation for&#13;
Tanzania.&#13;
In some Western African countries (Ghana, Nigeria, and the Ivory&#13;
Coast), women are more active in trade. But their status remains weak.&#13;
Harrington (1978) uses two measures to examine the position of women: an&#13;
index of physical and nutritional stress that measures the proportion of the&#13;
reproductive life spent either pregnant or breastfeeding, and an index of&#13;
economic roles and responsibilities that measures the woman's responsibility&#13;
for household and personal expenses. Both measures show Nigerian women to be&#13;
very heavily burdened.&#13;
Tanzania provides an interesting case in which state policy&#13;
recognized the women's predicament. Julius Nyerere (1967) said it was&#13;
"impossible to deny that the women did, and still do, more than their fair&#13;
share of the work in the fields and in the home." Government attempted to&#13;
provide relief to women by changing production relations through ujamaa,&#13;
villagisation, provision of basic needs and in other ways. Undoubtedly, some&#13;
improvement has occurred but Croll (1981) is not enthusiastic about the net&#13;
outcome. According to her, "women remain dependent upon and dominated by men&#13;
due to the primary place men have in relation to production....."     Most land&#13;
is cultivated privately where the male exercises control. Communal farming&#13;
imposes an additional demand on women's time while cash returns from the&#13;
activity are frequently appropriated by their spouses. Government attempts to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
assist private farming through extension and supply of new equipment tend to&#13;
neglect women (Fortman 1976, 1979)o An impressive expansion of schools has&#13;
occurred but disparity in access to education as between boys and girls still&#13;
persists. A major effort has been made to expand improved water supply,&#13;
thereby releiving the burden on women. The recent budgetary crisis has&#13;
undermined the maintenance and effectiveness of these and other basic need&#13;
services.&#13;
We can conclude this section by acknowledging that our understanding&#13;
of fertility determinants in Africa is weako Statistical analysis at the&#13;
household level provides some clues. These are no different than the results&#13;
of similar multiple correlation exercises elsewhere. What may distinguish the&#13;
African scene is the relatively slower response of fertility to socio-economic&#13;
development. It may also be that these indices of development have to reach&#13;
higher threshold levels in Africa than in other places before they trigger a&#13;
fertility reduction. In addition, it seems that analysis at the household&#13;
level should be supplemented by explorations of intra-family relationships and&#13;
of larger social groups such as kinship and tribe. High fertility may reflect&#13;
a search for physical security in a fragmented, traditional society. It may&#13;
be the woman's way of acquiring power; through children they can influence the&#13;
behaviour of others, including, of course, the children themselves (Safilios-&#13;
Rothschild 1982)o If society impedes other avenues to power such as pursuit&#13;
of autonomous economic activity, then women may compensate by having large&#13;
numbers of children. Righ fertility may also be a response by rural women to&#13;
the onerous work-load assigned to them (Youssef 1982)o Children, according to&#13;
this view, can be regarded as a captive labour force that assist women to&#13;
carry out their responsibilities. The incomplete understanding of fertility&#13;
determinants in Africa is not a good reason for government inaction in thîs&#13;
sphere. Enough is known to provide a reliable basis for population policies.&#13;

V. Population Policies: Present and Future&#13;
Present Status&#13;
A review of the development plans of Sub-Saharan countries indicates that very&#13;
few considered demographic aspects very seriously (Stamper 1977).&#13;
At least eight parameters need attention in this context: rates of population&#13;
growth; projections of future population size, future school-age population,&#13;
and future working age population; and estimates of fertility, mortality,&#13;
current school-age population, and current working-age population.&#13;
A similar picture emerges from a study by the Population Council&#13;
which classifies countries by their population policy (Table 12). Category A&#13;
is used for a strongly antinatalist policy, B for a policy moderately suppor-&#13;
tive of a family planning program (for health and human rights reasons), and C&#13;
for a neutral or pronatalist population policy. Most countries in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa are in the B and C categories. Only three countries--Kenya, Ghana and&#13;
Botswana--are in the A category.&#13;
The Economic Commission for Africa has also examined the population&#13;
policy of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (see table 12). Category I is used&#13;
for a strong antinatalist policy with direct government intervention.&#13;
Category II is used for a policy moderately supportive of a family planning&#13;
program (for health and human rights reasons) with no direct fertility&#13;
reduction goal. Most countries in Category II perceive their fertility levels&#13;
as being satisfactory. Category III is for neutral or a pronatalist policy in&#13;
which some countries perceive their fertility levels as being too low and some&#13;
actually limit access to methods of fertility regulation.&#13;

A or I    Official policy to reduce the populatior growtlh rate.   Tn addition to supporting family planning to&#13;
implementing this policv, countries in this categorv also support famtly plannina for reasons of health as&#13;
a human right.&#13;
B or Il   Official support of family planning activities for other than demographic reasons.     Countries in this&#13;
category usually support family planning for reasons of bealth and as a human riEht, hut any antinatalist&#13;
effect is a by-product, not an objective.&#13;
C or III   Residual category.  Countries in this category neither have a policy to reduce the population growth nor&#13;
do they support family planning programs for any reason, demographic or otherwise.     "C" or ITI countries&#13;
thus incltde those that are neutral toward Population growth rates as vell as those that are pronatalist.&#13;

The two classifications are essentially the same, but the ECA classi-&#13;
fication provides more recent information on some countries (Uganda and&#13;
Cameroon) and covers more countries. Most Sub-Saharan African countries are&#13;
in categories II (similar to B) and III (similar to C). Only eight countries&#13;
(comprising about 20.0% of the total population of Africa) fall in category&#13;
I. Annex table 19 outlines current perceptions, policies and population&#13;
programs in these countries. Six of these countries are in Eastern Africa.&#13;
In West Africa only two countries, Ghana and Senegal, have an explicit&#13;
population policy. Even countries in Category I cannot be said to have an&#13;
effective population policy. The commitment to reduce the natural increase in&#13;
population remains partial or tends to vacillate. This is illustrated by the&#13;
Kenyan case.&#13;
Kenya was the first Sub-Saharan country to adopt an official national&#13;
family planning program.   It did this in 1967, but the program received sub-&#13;
stantial support only during the Third Five-Year Plan (1975-79). The goals of&#13;
the program under that plan were to reduce the high annual rate of natural&#13;
increase of population (estimated at 3.3% in 1975 and 3.0% in 1979) by&#13;
recruiting 640,000 new family planning acceptors and thereby helping to avert&#13;
some 150,000 births. But there was a serious shortfall in achieving the&#13;
targets. Moreover, the rates of continuing family planning use were excep-&#13;
tionally low.   A preliminary estimate shows that the average number of&#13;
revisits per client is only about 3.5; in other words, the average new client&#13;
comes back to the clinic fewer than four times and then drops out of the&#13;
system. The low retention is also reflected in the low prevalence rates of&#13;
contraceptive practice. Only a small proportion of women of reproductive age&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58 -&#13;
have been found to use contraceptives. Recent evidence of practice and accep-&#13;
tance rates comes from the 1977-78 Kenya fertilîty survey. Although 42 per-&#13;
cent of the sampled, ever-married women knew of a source of family planning&#13;
services, only 12 percent reported ever having visited such a facility0 This&#13;
nonetheless represents a slight improvement over the results of the contracep-&#13;
tive practice survey of 1974. Roughly 5 percent of women in the reproductive&#13;
age group are currently practicing famîly planning.&#13;
On the supply side of the Kenyan family planning program, the main&#13;
issue is access to and quality of services. The acceptance of family planning&#13;
is affected by the availability and quality of services delivered and the dis-&#13;
tance traveled to service facilities. More than 80 percent of rural Kenyan&#13;
women give birth at home. To reach the nearest health facility, they must&#13;
travel on the average more than three miles0 Because rural health facilities&#13;
are overburdened with demands for curative services, because preventative and&#13;
promotive services are underdeveloped, and because outreach programs are&#13;
insufficiently coordinated, many women of reproductive age remain outside the&#13;
health delivery system.   The family-health field educators have reached some&#13;
of these women, but they can cover only a small percentage with present&#13;
staff. Extending and improving access to rural health services could increase&#13;
the number of acceptors and long-term users of family planning services0    On&#13;
the demand side, the most important issue is to find the links between&#13;
socioeconomic development and the demand for and use of family planning0    The&#13;
factors that explain high fertility in Kenya also explain the low acceptance&#13;
of family planning0&#13;
Ten countries in Eastern Africa and an equal number in the Western&#13;
Africa fall into Category II, iîe. governments in these countries provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
official support for family planning but not in order to reduce population&#13;
growth. Nigeria belongs in this group. The combined population of these 20&#13;
countries comprises 45.6% of the African total. Category Il is a diverse&#13;
group. Zimbabwe, for example, has succeeded in having 15 percent of women in&#13;
the reproductive age group practice family planning; a far higher proportion&#13;
than in Kenya placed in Category I. Some countries in this group have&#13;
recorded important changes in policy in recent years, i.e. from a neutral&#13;
population policy to one which emphasizes spacing of children. The need to&#13;
curb population growth was recognized for the first time in Rwanda's Second&#13;
Plan (1977-81). A National Population Office was established in 1981 to&#13;
formulate a population policy, to carry out an informational campaign using&#13;
mass media, to coordinate pilot family planning projects and to prepare for a&#13;
larger program. In Tanzania, President Nyerere has called for the formulation&#13;
of a national birth policy and for launching campaign to educate people on the&#13;
need for adequate spacing of children (UNFPA 1982). Other countries in&#13;
Category Il have not had such transformations in policy.&#13;
Family planning activities in almost all countries in categories I&#13;
and II were begun by volunteer groups. In many of these countries, family&#13;
planning services were first provided by clinics run by the voluntary organi-&#13;
zation, which still run these clinics in some countries, along with government&#13;
services. The small groups of pioneering volunteers in these countries often&#13;
became organized as local Family Planning Associations (FPA) which are affil-&#13;
iated with the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). The volun-&#13;
tary associations - notably FPAs - have been instrumental in many of these&#13;
countries in persuading the government to assume responsibility to provide&#13;
services. Even in those countries where the government has not yet stepped&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
in, FPAs are the most important force to create interest in the government&#13;
about family planning. The voluntary associations in Africa hold out a&#13;
promise to be innovative and promote family planning.&#13;
Ten countries in Western Afrîca and four on the Eastern side are in&#13;
Category III, i.eo governments in these countries are either pronatalist or&#13;
neutral on the question of population. Surprisingly, this category includes&#13;
Malawi and Burundi; countries in whîch population pressure is very visible0&#13;
An important change seems to have occurred recently in Malawi; Government is&#13;
reported to have decided to introduce chîld spacing activîties in its maternai&#13;
and child health programo&#13;
It is right to conclude, then, that present population policies in&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa remain weak. At least, 14 governments do not seem to&#13;
recognize the seriousness of the population issue (Category III). This is&#13;
also true, perhaps, of many of the 20 governments in Category Il, although&#13;
others in this group are aware of the magnitude of the demographic problem but&#13;
either cannot or will not intervene in this area. Even countrles in Category&#13;
I cannot be said to have a strong population policy. Recent changes in&#13;
Rwanda, Tanzania and Malawi are promising but they do not yet add up to a&#13;
different picture.&#13;
There is no satisfactory explanation of twhy the policy posture on&#13;
population remains ambivalent in Africa today. Nevertheless, the following&#13;
considerations help in understanding the present position:&#13;
The common perception is that of "empty spaces" and vast&#13;
unutilized natural resources ready to be harnessed. The&#13;
fact that population density is low în most countries&#13;
(there is no visible congestion as in Calcutta or Java)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
tends to reinforce this perception of limitless&#13;
frontiers.&#13;
The message that Africa faces a population problem has&#13;
come mostly from the West, and in many quarters it has&#13;
been dismissed as either irrelevant or mischievous.&#13;
Religious and tribal factors make population an extremely&#13;
sensitive political issue.&#13;
Governments have been pre-occupied by tasks aimed at&#13;
nation-building and economic development. The typical&#13;
African view at the 1974 Bucharest World Population&#13;
Conference was that "... ... economic progress and&#13;
foreign aid were more urgent needs than curbing of&#13;
population growth" (Population Reference Bureau,&#13;
undated).&#13;
Accumulating financial and economic difficulties during&#13;
recent years in many countries have diverted the energies&#13;
of policy-makers to the task of tackling urgent, short-&#13;
term issues. Longer-term concerns, including population&#13;
growth, have receded into the background.&#13;
New Policy Initiatives&#13;
A prerequisite for the strengthening of population policies is the&#13;
recognition by policy-makers and opinion-leaders in Africa that such moves are&#13;
in the national interest. It is not at all clear how such recognition will&#13;
come about and when.   Past attempts by non-Africans to promote population&#13;
policies have not borne much fruit. Within Africa, the population issue is&#13;
not at the center of the stage. National leaders show little enthusiasm about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62 -&#13;
tackling this question and those few who have tried to do so regard the&#13;
population issue as a political liability. Building commitment for population&#13;
policies will not be easy. It will require not only a thorough grasp of the&#13;
economic and social aspects, not only the ability to project the case for&#13;
government intervention in a difficult area but also' the capacity to define&#13;
what is an acceptable intervention, taking account of the range within which&#13;
social and cultural change is feasible.&#13;
In many countries it may not be possible for leaders to visualize the&#13;
introduction of comprehensive population policies aîmed at reducing family&#13;
size. This is certainly the case in countries classified into categories lI &amp;&#13;
III and even some countries placed in Category I. But even in countries&#13;
facing formidable socio-cultural barriers, it should be possible to define&#13;
some acceptable program to make a start,   For example, governments may be able&#13;
to reinforce the traditional norm favoring child spacîng, as in Rwanda and&#13;
Tanzania. Many tribes favour sexual abstinence after childbirth to ensure&#13;
spacing between births. Page and Lestaeghe (1981) summarize findings of over&#13;
100 studies on postpartum-sexual abstinence and note that the usual duration&#13;
of such abstinence was over one year. Strong taboos and customs promoted thîs&#13;
restraintD but their hold is weakening gradually. Recent increases in&#13;
fertility in a number of Sub-Saharan countries can be partly ascribed to the&#13;
shortening of birth intervals, caused by shortening of traditional abstinence&#13;
and breast feeding, without compensating increase of contraceptiono In&#13;
Nigeria, for example, the age at marriage has risen significantly tending to&#13;
reduce fertility, but this is more than offset by the weakening of traditional&#13;
norms about child spacing (Lestaeghe et al. 1981)o In Ghana, a survey by the&#13;
National Food and Nutrition in 1961-62 found a decline in breast feeding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
associated with urbanization. Gaisie (1981) analyzing World Fertility Survey&#13;
(WFS) pilot survey data from Ghana observed that differentials in the&#13;
postpartum variables are the major factors responsible for the regional&#13;
variations in fertility.&#13;
Given this emphasis on child-spacing in the traditional culture, it&#13;
should be possible to build a government program which reinforces abstinence&#13;
by contraception. At least such programs can check the drift towards higher&#13;
fertility accompanying the weakening of tribal sanctions. If it is possible&#13;
to lengthen average intervals between pregnancies, such programs could lower&#13;
fertility. More important, once family planning is accepted by a community it&#13;
can not only uphold norms regarding child spacing but also serve as an&#13;
instrument for avoiding more children than desired. The incidence of excess&#13;
fertility (defined in terms of private househo'ld or group values) can be quite&#13;
large at a time when infant and child mortality is falling sharply. This&#13;
incidence can be reduced by an informational effort aimed at increasing&#13;
awareness of participants in the family planning program about changes in&#13;
vital rates taking place in their community. Such awareness will cause&#13;
parents to revise downward their ideas about the number of pregnancies&#13;
required to achieve the desired family-size.&#13;
Countries in Categories I &amp; II, which already have some kind of&#13;
family planning program, should consider the full-range of policy options&#13;
aimed at stimulating demand for contraception and at increasing the access of&#13;
the population in the reproductive age-group to contraceptive services. Not&#13;
much emphasis has been given so far to the demand side of the equation. This&#13;
neglect has proved to be very costly; it has meant that existing facilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64 -&#13;
are not being used fully and that women who became acceptors at one time soon&#13;
dropped out of the system.&#13;
What is required is a deeper assessment of the base-lîne position&#13;
(than has been undertaken typically) before designing an operational&#13;
population policy. Such an assessment must identify both the factors that&#13;
make for high fertility in each community as well as the dynamic elements&#13;
trying to bring about social change. Is physical security a major concern?&#13;
What can be done to relieve anxiety on this score? Are women deprived of&#13;
income-earning opportunities? Do extension services, credit agencies and&#13;
cooperatives discriminate against women? Does the intra-famîly division of&#13;
labour impose an onerous burden on women. How does the land-tenure affect&#13;
women's sense of security? Do norms regarding family size differ by sex and&#13;
by generation? What kinds of individualD households , kinship groups and&#13;
social organizations are trying to break away from traditional attitudes0&#13;
What is the nature and extent of opposition to deviant behaviour? What are&#13;
the impediments to easy access to contraceptive supplies?&#13;
This kind of diagnosis will permît the designing of gcvernment&#13;
interventions responsive to the needs of the local situation0 Most family&#13;
planning programs today are linked to the health delivery system and they are&#13;
largely clinic-based. In many cases it may be desirable and practical to&#13;
supplement existing outlets wîth (î) communîty-based schemes, (ii) commercial&#13;
channels, (iii) activity of women's organizations and (iv) efforts of rural&#13;
development agencies. Similarly, most exîsting programs are wueak on extension&#13;
and promotion0 New instruments for propagating the family planning message&#13;
can be designed using local acceptors, traditional channels of communication&#13;
as well as nation-wide systems of non-formal education (adult lîteracy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
campaigns, youth recreation programs), mass-media and the introduction of&#13;
family-life education in secondary schools and colleges.&#13;
Attempts on the part of African governments and foreign aid agencies&#13;
to promote rural development have not recognized the women's issue. The&#13;
neglect of research on traditional subsistence crops, the preeminent domain of&#13;
female farming, has continued until very recently. Extension services, credit&#13;
agencies and agricultural cooperatives have allowed much less access to women&#13;
farmers than to the men. Staudt (1979) describes the scene in the Kakamega&#13;
district in Kenya where the proportionate incidence of visits by extension&#13;
workers to women farmers was far lower than that to male farmers. Access to&#13;
credit and agricultural training displayed the same bias. The recent report&#13;
on the history of the International Development Association acknowledges that&#13;
the design of rural development projects have not displayed sufficient sensi-&#13;
tivity to these important aspects (IDA 1982). Govts. in Africa can adopt a&#13;
number of development policies to improve the socio-economic condition of&#13;
women. These policies are worthwhile from the standpoint of expanding&#13;
production and promoting equity; they may also indirectly reduce fertility, as&#13;
argued earlier in this paper. Very important in this context will be a&#13;
reorientation of agricultural policies aimed at increasing women's access to&#13;
(i) land, (ii) new production technology for food crops, (iii) basic skills&#13;
training (iv) credit and (v) cooperatives. This reorientation will not be eay&#13;
to bring about in the face of present attitudes and given the political weak-&#13;
ness of women. It will require a great deal of persistence and plenty of&#13;
resourcefulness. Women will need to be trained as extension workers, assis-&#13;
tant teachers and health auxilliaries. They will need to go to secondary&#13;
schools and institutions of higher learning in much larger numbers. They will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66 -&#13;
need to become professionals, technicians, civil servants and party offi-&#13;
cials. Annex Table 20 presents indices of male-female differentiais in&#13;
education, life expectancy, employment in professional jobs.&#13;
Population policies in Africa must be viewed very broadLy. The goal&#13;
is not simply to deliver contraceptives through the health network. What is&#13;
required is a transformation of production and social relationships and&#13;
through these changes a major revolution in values and attitudes that&#13;
determine desired family size.&#13;
Policies aimed at altering existing preferences regarding family size&#13;
are not acceptable in most countries in Africa, although they have been&#13;
applied successfully in Asia. For example, incentives might be provîded with&#13;
the purpose of changing the preference for family size--a kind of compensation&#13;
for foregone fertility. There can be a strong justification for such compen-&#13;
sation if the private (perceived) net benefit of having an extra child exceeds&#13;
the social net benefit. A scheme of financial incentives for households to&#13;
avoid pregnancy is especially suitable for a well-defined group of people if&#13;
the scheme can be efficiently administered. For example, such programs have&#13;
been introduced experimentally for tea estate workers in India (Ridker, 1971)o&#13;
Another important step is to provide disincentives for having many&#13;
children. This could include eliminating income-tax relief in cases of three&#13;
or more children, paid maternity leave up to the first two pregnancies only,&#13;
progressive increases in childbirth costs after the first two deliveries, and&#13;
loss of priority for public housing if family size exceeds a defined level.&#13;
But most people in Sub-Saharan countrîes live in rural areas and their access&#13;
to benefits and services from the government are limited. Wit'drawing these&#13;
services and benefits, therefore, would have little force. In the future,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
some of these services are going to expand substantially, and a discriminating&#13;
policy to encourage fertility regulation will become feasible.&#13;
It is not easy to force the pace of history and yet Africa's economic&#13;
and social development requires the adoption and implementation of a broad-&#13;
based population policy.&#13;

have if during her lifetime her childbearing behavior were the same as that&#13;
of the cross section of women at the time of the observation. The TFR often&#13;
serves as an estimate of the average number of children per family.&#13;
NRR - Net Reproduction Rate: The number of daughters a woman would have,&#13;
under prevailing fertility and mortality patterns, who would survive to the&#13;
mean age of childbearing.&#13;

            Rapid population growth in sub-Saharan
            Africa : issues and policies
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Substantial social and economic progress
            in sub - Saharan Africa during the past 15 years has not
            altered the traditional regime of very high fertility.
            Explanations for this paradox have to turn to broad societal
            characteristics not captured by multivariate analysis of the
            household level. The search for physical survival promotes a
            very large family norm. High fertility may also reflect the
            predicament of the African woman. This paper argues that
            enough is known to provide a reliable basis for policies
            aimed at reducing fertility. The case for such policies
            rests on evidence that the challenge posed by accelerating
            population growth in Africa has not elicited a commensurate
            response in the form of technological or organizational
            progress. Instead, growing population numbers have
            accentuated the food deficit, magnified the budgetary
            problem of financing basic needs services and complicated
            the employment issue. The paper projects future population
            growth of nine sample countries, accounting for two-thirds
            of Africa's total population, on the basis of four sets
            of assumptions. These exercises confirm the desirability of
            action by African governments to reduce fertility.
