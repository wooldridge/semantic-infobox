1. URBAN TRANSPORT IN THE RECIFE METROPOLITAN REGION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1 .1               This project has its origins in two major developments at the Federal and State&#13;
level: (a) the decision of the Government of Brazil (GOB) to decentralize and transfer several&#13;
subdivisions of the Brazilian Urban Trains Company (Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos, CBTU)&#13;
from the Federal to the State/Municipal Governments as mandated by the 1 988 Constitution; (b) the&#13;
willingness of the State of Pernambuco (PE) to takeover the Recife subdivision of the CBTU (STU-REC)&#13;
and better integrate it with the predominantly privately-owned bus transport system. The GOB started&#13;
by decentralizing the two largest CBTU subdivisions (Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro); once that was&#13;
successfully accomplished, it decided to proceed with the decentralization of the Belo Horizonte and&#13;
Recife subdivisions.&#13;
1.2                As in the case of S3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the GOB requested assistance&#13;
from the Bank to help in completing the STU-REC network and effectively integrating it with the other&#13;
modes. PE agreed to takeover the system as long as the GOB would extend the system to Timbi (see&#13;
map), modernize the South line, and build the accesses to facilitate integration at the systems main&#13;
stations. The identification mission took place in early 1 994, and based on its findings, the Bank agreed&#13;
to proceed with the evaluation of the project provided PE and the Municipality of Recife (MREC) would&#13;
incorporate in its urban transport strategy the following two elements: (a) an effective coordination&#13;
between the state and municipal governments of the Recife Metropolitan Region (RMR); and (b) a&#13;
formal financing mechanisms considered crucial to create an enabling environment for the long-term&#13;
financial sustainability of the RMR's urban transport systems. PE moved swiftly and diligently to&#13;
include these elements in its strategy. The active interaction of PE representatives with all preparation&#13;
missions indicated this project is a priority for the State and for the RMR.&#13;
B. Urban Transport in the RMR: An Overview&#13;
1.3                Background. The Recife Metropolitan Region, with 2,200 sq. km, has 2.8 million&#13;
inhabitants spread irregularly over 13 municipalities which are dominated by the Municipality of Recife&#13;
with 1.4 million inhabitants. Annual population growth of the RMR and of MREC averaged 1.8 percent&#13;
and 0.7 percent respectively in the last five years. The RMR generates roughly 55 percent of the GDP&#13;
of the state of PE and is considered the fourth most important region of the country. Each day, 2.3&#13;
million person trips take place in the RMR of which 59.4 percent are by bus (90 percent privately&#13;
operated), 34.0 percent by private automobile, 4.6 percent by METROREC (CBTU's metropolitan train),&#13;
0.7 percent by CBTU's suburban diesel train (South line) and the remaining 1.3 percent by trolleybus.&#13;
This level of urban transport activity-dominated by the road-based motorized modes-is concentrated&#13;
in eleven radial corridors (corredores estruturais) and four semi-circular rings which bisects those&#13;
corridors.&#13;
1.4                The bus system is operated by 18 private companies and 1 municipal company&#13;
(CTU) which also operates trolleybuses. Two-thirds of the bus routes penetrate to the MREC's central&#13;
business district (CBD), adding to the congestion in the center. The main bus corridors of the RMR are:&#13;
Caxanga Avenue (6.0 km), Imbiribeira Avenue (8.0 km), and Jose Rufino/PE-07 corridor (5.0 km). Of&#13;
these corridors, only one has reserved bus lanes. The commercial speed of the buses is 23 km/hr in&#13;
the reserved bus lane and 1 4 km/hr in the CBD. During peak periods, most highway corridors are&#13;
clogged with cars and buses. Bus services are generally of low speed, and due to traffic congestion,&#13;
they become unreliable. The RMR bus routes are allocated and managed by the Empresa Metropolitana&#13;
de Transportes Urbanos (EMTU), a regional bus transport coordination agency. Tariffs are also set by&#13;
EMTU. EMTU has been working to integrate buses with the CBTU system, and there are already 48&#13;
bus lines which are integrated with the urban rail system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.5                 The RMR rail network consists of two separate systems operated by CBTU. The&#13;
main system (the Central line also known as METROREC) was inaugurated in 1985 with 20.5 km of&#13;
double track and connects the edge of the city center with Coqueiral (11 km away) where the main&#13;
line splits in two branches towards Jaboatao and Rodoviaria. It is an electrified surface metro which&#13;
carries 105,000 passengers/day instead of the originally planned 300,000 pass./day, mainly due to&#13;
the lack of appropriate transfer terminals with the bus system. The other system is the South line&#13;
(Linha Sul), a one meter gauge diesel-operated suburban train system with 32 km of track which&#13;
carries only 20,000 pass./day (10 percent of trips in the corridor) although it serves an area of high&#13;
demand. Along this corridor a number of intermunicipal and municipal bus services are the main mode&#13;
of transport because they offer a better frequency and, unlike the South line, reach the CBD.&#13;
1.6                 CBTU would like the project to finance the conversion of 14.2 km of the diesel&#13;
line into an electrified railway similar to the METROREC, and extend the South line to meet the Central&#13;
line. This would increase the South line's traffic in the first year of operation to 1 58,000 pass./day.&#13;
During project preparation, the project team suggested that after a detailed demand analysis was&#13;
undertaken, a careful evaluation be carried out to compare the present rail service with an improved&#13;
reserved bus service, with an improved rail diesel service, and finally with the proposed electrified&#13;
service. This was done, and the electrification of the South line proved the least-cost alternative. In&#13;
addition, to make METROREC more demand responsive, CBTU proposes the construction of one&#13;
additional 4.5 km link (TIP-Timbi) which would connect a predominately housing area with the CBD.&#13;
1.7                 Approximately 87 percent of the urban population earns less than three minimum&#13;
salaries. If successfully implemented, the project will primarily benefit the poor in the participating&#13;
cities, since they depend mainly on bus, metro, and suburban rail services to commute to and from&#13;
work, especially those living in the "favelas" for whom access to the areas of employment is a daily&#13;
ordeal. The urban poor are the main users of public transport and bear the brunt of its problems: (a)&#13;
shortage of capacity at peak hours resulting in overcrowded (&gt; 1 2 pass/m2), often unsafe conditions;&#13;
(b) long work journeys (2.5 hours/day) from the metropolitan periphery to the urban center, often with&#13;
more than two modal transfers; and (c) paying over a fifth of their income in fares.&#13;
1.8                 The air quality of the city is degraded by the presence of excessive levels of&#13;
carbon monoxide, ozone and particulate. Vehicles account for 90 percent of most air pollutants in the&#13;
RMR. In 1992, the number of vehicles registered in the RMR was 342,953. Vehicular air pollution has&#13;
been somewhat mitigated by the use of alcohol fuels. Vehicular accidents, on the other hand, have&#13;
become a major source of environmental risks for the MREC. In 1 993, they accounted for 6,645&#13;
accidents with 6.6 deaths/10,000 vehicles, 16 percent higher than in 1991. Congestion and&#13;
overcrowding of the public transport system are also a major source of environmental stress.&#13;
C. Institutional Responsibilities for Urban Transport in the RMR&#13;
1.9                 There are four main government bodies responsible for overseeing the urban&#13;
transport sector in the RMR: (a) the State Roads Administration (Direp§o de Estradas de Rodagem do&#13;
Estado de Pernambuco, DER-PE), which regulates all the intermunicipal bus services and road network&#13;
of the region; (b) the Recife Metropolitan Transport Company (Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes&#13;
Urbanos, EMTU) a state agency which coordinates all the intermunicipal bus services in the RMR plus,&#13;
by delegation, all the MREC municipal bus services; (c) the State Traffic Administration (Departamento&#13;
de Transito do Estado de Pernambuco, DETRAN-PE) in charge of traffic engineering in the region; and&#13;
(d) the Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos (CBTU) which through its Recife subdivision, known as&#13;
STU-REC, operates the metropolitan and suburban train services, presently under federal government&#13;
jurisdiction. A more detailed description of the entities related and/or dealing with urban transport in&#13;
the RMR is given in Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.10                Recife was the first Brazilian metropolitan region to have a regional transport&#13;
coordination body (EMTU) which effectively plans and coordinates all the integration, financing and&#13;
subsidy allocation of bus services in the RMR on behalf of the municipalities of the region and of the&#13;
State. Unfortunately, it does not have jurisdiction over the CBTU. CBTU is still under Federal&#13;
Government jurisdiction although it works informally with EMTU to integrate bus at some of its&#13;
stations. However, STU-REC is not part of EMTU's tariff clearing house ("cSmara de compensacao")&#13;
and therefore, it is not compensated for the very low tariffs it charges.&#13;
1.1 1               EMTU supports the project and the improvement of bus corridors which feed&#13;
the rail system because as is, the METROREC and the South line contribute very little of their potential&#13;
to alleviate the heavy traffic congestion in the RMR, and instead, they are a financial burden to the&#13;
GOB which must contribute US$30 million/year to keep them afloat, since revenues cover only 11&#13;
percent of the operating costs (without depreciation and cost of capital). PE considers the&#13;
abovementioned rail improvements a condition for the decentralization of the rail system, i.e., to take&#13;
over STU-REC from the Federal Government.&#13;
1.1 2               Since several levels of government have been formulating policies and regulating&#13;
urban transport without a formal coordinating arrangement, there has been a lack of consistency in the&#13;
fares charged by similar or competing modes, duplication of investments, absence of criteria to&#13;
prioritize investments, and only embryonic modal integration. This has led to bus services continuing&#13;
to operate in corridors where urban rail is more suited, to the lack of promotion of hub and spoke&#13;
services, to disparate subsidy policies which are often based on non-economic considerations, and to&#13;
the absence of user representation in the urban transport decision-making process. Recently, there has&#13;
been fruitful but informal cooperation between EMTU and STU-REC. If EMTU formally includes STU-&#13;
REC in its "cSmara de compensap§o" or other urban transport financing mechanisms, EMTU will truly&#13;
become a Regional Transportation Coordination Commission. This must be encouraged and it is one&#13;
of the main objectives of the proposed project.&#13;
D. Key Sectoral Issues&#13;
1.1 3               A number of key issues must be addressed to in order to improve the supply of&#13;
urban transport services in the RMR and to guarantee their orderly development and sustainability in&#13;
the long term. They are: (a) capacity and safety issues; (b) institutional issues; (c) cost recovery and&#13;
financial management issues; (d) targeting of subsidies; (e) environmental issues; and (f) transport&#13;
planning issues.&#13;
1 .1 4              Capacity and Safety Issues. The most important concern is the need to increase&#13;
the supply of adequate cost-efficient peak-hour capacity in order to guarantee an acceptable level of&#13;
service to the average commuter, with reasonable safety. This can be done by: (a) rehabilitating and&#13;
restructuring existing systems and by building new ones which are justified from a technical, economic&#13;
and, especially, financial standpoint. Rail and bus rapid transit offer the best alternatives in this respect;&#13;
(b) improving traffic management through appropriate traffic engineering equipment, in order to better&#13;
manage available road space and reduce congestion; and (c) reducing accidents through transit safety&#13;
education campaigns, law enforcement, and traffic engineering. The proposed project addresses this&#13;
set of issues by increasing the peak-hour capacity and safety of the South line, grade separating the&#13;
several at-grade crossings of that line, and extending the METROREC by 4.5 km.&#13;
1.15                Institutional Issues. The most critical institutional issues are: (a) the fine-tuning&#13;
of relations between state and municipal governments and a clear definition of their respective roles&#13;
in the financing, planning and operation of urban transport services in accordance with the 1 988&#13;
Constitution; (b) the transformation of EMTU into a truly all-mode regional coordination entity&#13;
empowered by the RMR to plan, coordinate and set priorities for new investments and modal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
integration; and (c) the appropriate modification of regulations, including the elimination of regulatory&#13;
barriers which might prevent free entry and/or competition in the market for provision of public&#13;
transport services. The proposed project addresses this set of issues by requiring that EMTU becomes&#13;
an all-mode Regional Transport Coordination Commission (RTCC) rather than just a bus agency.&#13;
1.16                Cost Recovery and Financial Management Issues. There is a need to address&#13;
cost recovery from a more commercially-oriented standpoint by: (a) setting tariffs which, when added&#13;
to subsidies, cover at least the long-run variable costs (defined as out-of-pocket costs plus depreciation&#13;
of equipment and cost of capital); (b) controlling fare evasion; (c) setting appropriate peak and off-peak&#13;
pricing; (d) improving the financial management of the systems through wide-ranging cost-cutting&#13;
measures, staff rationalization policies, and by appointing more financial managers to run the mass&#13;
transit systems; and (ei revamping funding mechanisms in order to guarantee adequate financing for&#13;
the implementation of new mass transit systems and the sustainability of the existing systems. The&#13;
proposed project addresses this set of issues by requiring better financial management of the rail-based&#13;
system which must meet financial targets, and by pushing for the introduction of formal financial&#13;
mechanisms to ensure long-run sustainability of the urban transport sector.&#13;
1 .17               Targeting of Subsidies. Any remaining blanket subsidies paid to operators ought&#13;
to be eliminated. Urban households have been devoting increasingly large proportions of their incomes&#13;
to transport. Further, transport-related expenditures have become a considerable burden on&#13;
government budgets. The appropriate targeting of urban transport subsidies and their extension to the&#13;
informal sector which is not presently covered by mechanisms such as the vale-transporte is a major&#13;
issue which must be addressed in the short term. ('Vale transporte' is a mechanism by which&#13;
employers are required to provide their employees with a wage subsidy that covers any amount above&#13;
6 percent whenever the total costs of monthly "home to work" trips exceed 6 percent of their&#13;
salaries.) Appropriate mechanisms for financing such subsidies (tariff differentiation, contractual&#13;
budgetary transfers, etc.) and channelling them to target groups through tokens, multimodal passes,&#13;
and differential tariffs need to be designed. Given the high number of low-income families which might&#13;
not be covered by existing target subsidies such as the vale-transporte, the proposed project will&#13;
examine what type of targeted subsidies can be used and are easy to administer.&#13;
1 .1 8              Environmental Issues. The increase in motorization rates of the RMR is increasing&#13;
congestion, motor vehicle emissions, and noise. A strategy is needed to address these issues and&#13;
develop a vehicle inspection and maintenance WI/M) program. The reduction of the environmental&#13;
impacts of urban traffic congestion, and noise pollution in the urban area could be done through: (a)&#13;
the allocation of responsibilities across government levels for the enforcement of existing laws and&#13;
definition of tougher standards; (b) the use of cleaner and quieter transport systems; (c) where&#13;
appropriate, the use of non-motorized transport; (d) the improvement of traffic management and&#13;
control; and (e) the strengthening of traffic safety education and the enforcement of the traffic&#13;
regulations. In the long run, assessment of the potential role of market-based incentives to address&#13;
pollution and the implementation of the polluter pay principle to minimize the fiscal burden implied by&#13;
de facto government subsidies to polluters ought to be considered. The proposed project would be a&#13;
modest first step towards addressing this set of issues and help set the course for future actions.&#13;
1.19                Transport Planning Issues. The need to strengthen RMR's transportation&#13;
planning, traffic data base, traffic management, and evaluation of new investments, could be met if&#13;
there is a formal coordinating agency for urban transport in the metropolitan region. This agency should&#13;
be equipped with a battery of sketch planning, demand and supply models that would test different&#13;
land use, air quality and urban transport scenarios. Furthermore, an integrated land use, urban&#13;
transport, and air quality strategy should be designed and periodically revised. The proposed project&#13;
addresses this set of issues by strengthening EMTU and providing the funds for the integrated planning&#13;
strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
1.20               In the future, urban transport policies in the RMR would be geared toward the&#13;
efficient and equitable provision of urban transport services, in particular for low-income groups which&#13;
have traditionally received less attention. Policies would be consistent with broad transport sector&#13;
objectives, as well as with the objectives of the urban subsector. In accordance with the 1 988&#13;
Constitution, the policies would support the decentralization of urban transport services from the&#13;
Federal Government to the States to facilitate modal and tariff integration and respond quickly to local&#13;
needs. The policies would simultaneously address the need for institutional coordination and an&#13;
integrated urban transport, land use, and environmental strategy. The general approach is to restore&#13;
the incentives which exist when privately-owned systems operate under competitive conditions.&#13;
Redesigned regulations and concessionary agreements, and improved bidding processes will promote&#13;
competition in the provision of bus services. Rates would be liberalized in the corridors where there&#13;
is effective competition. Many bus companies currently managed by local governments would be&#13;
privatized. Urban and metropolitan train operations would be decentralized through the reorganization&#13;
ot STU-REC, and the gradual transfer of the operation and ownership of the systems to newly-created&#13;
commuter train companies, managed either directly by the state and/or local governments or by private&#13;
interests operating under concessionary arrangements. Appropriate tariffs and financing mechanisms&#13;
would enable the efficient operation and development of the systems. Local governments would&#13;
continue to be responsible for traffic regulation and management but would improve their capacity to&#13;
manage the demand for road use, improve traffic management and street maintenance, protect the&#13;
environment, monitor the effects of regulations and taxation, promote integration of the various&#13;
transport systems, and coordination with land-use development.&#13;
E. Lessons from Experience in the Sector&#13;
1.21               Initial Bank support for the urban transport sector in Brazil was provided through&#13;
four urban transport projects totalling US$540 million, of which the First, Second and Third Urban&#13;
Transport Projects (Loans 1563-BR, 1839-BR, 1965-BR) have been completed. The Fourth Urban&#13;
Transport Project which continued the work started in the Third project was canceled because the&#13;
government abolished the federal agency in charge of urban transport (EBTU). Additional urban&#13;
transport projects financed by the Bank (Loans 3457-BR and 3633-BR for US$126 million and US$1128&#13;
million respectively) support the rehabilitation and decentralization of the CBTU from the federal to the&#13;
state government in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Loan 3457-BR (Sao Paulo) became effective on&#13;
February 3, 1993. This loan includes an institutional and policy development component which was&#13;
utilized in the preparation of the proposed project. Loan 3633-BR (Rio de Janeiro) was signed on&#13;
October 14, 1993 and became effective on March 14, 1994.&#13;
1.22               To build upon the experience of past urban transport projects for the design of&#13;
the proposed project, an analysis of "lessons learned" was undertaken (Annex 1). The review was&#13;
based on Project Completion Reports and Performance Audit Reports (PCR/PAR) in urban transport and&#13;
urban development. Recognition was made of trends and changes in project design since the&#13;
PCRs/PARs were completed. The main lessons identified and incorporated in the design of the&#13;
proposed project are:&#13;
(a) Institutional Strengthening. The organizations dealing with urban transport&#13;
at the federal, state and municipal levels should be reorganized and&#13;
strengthened. Studies included in the institutional component must be&#13;
carefully monitored and translated into action plans which the Borrower&#13;
should implement. Adequate supervision and follow-up on the studies have&#13;
been included in the project;&#13;
(b) Lack of counterpart funding has greatly influenced the pace of project&#13;
implementation and in some cases has led to cancellation of components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
An effort must be made to ensure that adequate provisions for counterpart&#13;
funds are included in the annual budgets of federal and state enterprises.&#13;
(c) Slow implementation has been a frequently occurring theme. The reasons&#13;
have included: lack of familiarity with Bank procedures, over-optimistic&#13;
scheduling at appraisal, lack of final engineering designs at appraisal,&#13;
changes in political commitment, and lack of counterpart funds. These&#13;
problems would be mitigated in the proposed project by such measures as:&#13;
strengthening capacity of operating agencies for financial management and&#13;
application of Bank procedures; and requiring final engineering design of the&#13;
first year's works for which technical assistance should be contracted if&#13;
need be with retroactive financing.&#13;
(d) Weak institutional capacity for the planning, design and implementation of&#13;
traffic and highway projects has been a common feature of many projects.&#13;
In the proposed project, all agencies have demonstrated adequate capacity&#13;
to carry out the required planning, design and implementation functions.&#13;
F. The Bank's Strategy for the RMR&#13;
1.23                Subsector strategy. In view of the issues stated above, the Bank's short-term&#13;
strategy will be aimed at: (a) assisting the state and municipal governments in formulating and&#13;
implementing an urban transport policy consistent with the above goals; (b) strengthening the&#13;
institutional framework and the decision-making process in the sector through adequate coordination&#13;
between the two levels of government and proper technical, economic and especially, financial&#13;
evaluation of projects and their prioritization by a regional coordination agency; (c) supporting a&#13;
program to decentralize, rehabilitate and extend existing services such as metro lines and busways,&#13;
which can more readily increase their efficiency and peak-hour capacity; (d) managing the demand for&#13;
road use through improved traffic management and road-user taxes, in order to reduce existing&#13;
congestion and the demand for travel by private single-occupancy automobiles; (e) decreasing the&#13;
number of fatalities and accidents due to urban transport; (f) introducing better cost-recovery&#13;
mechanisms including adequate cost-based peak-hour tariffs and fare evasion control in order to&#13;
strengthen their financial base; and (g) improving the targeting of subsidies to those who need them.&#13;
In the medium term, the Bank's strategy will focus on promoting a more efficient and financially&#13;
sustainable market-oriented supply of public transport services, through: (a) an appropriate reform of&#13;
regulations which will facilitate market entry, fare deregulation and public bidding in route allocation;&#13;
(b) promoting service differentiation especially in the bus systems; (c) defining eligibility requirements&#13;
and strengthening funding mechanisms for urban transport to cover operating deficits (based on pre-&#13;
agreed targets in contract-plans) and finance major investments; (d) supporting the evaluation and, if&#13;
justified, the introduction of new investments such as reserved busways and light rail transport; (e)&#13;
reducing the environmental impacts of urban transport by setting standards for air quality, noise&#13;
pollution, and visual intrusion as well as indicating who would pay for them and how; (f) assisting in&#13;
projects which improve the data base required for appropriate planning such as origin/destination&#13;
surveys and preparation of master plans which study land use and urban transport alternatives; and&#13;
(g) creating an enabling environment to increase private sector participation in the investment and&#13;
operations of urban transport systems. In the long term, the Bank's strategy will aim at reducing the&#13;
travel demand and increasing the effectiveness of transport facilities by integrating land use and&#13;
transport planning based on significant input by locally affected parties.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Background&#13;
2.1                 As mentioned in section i, this project has its origins in two major developments&#13;
at the Federal and State level: (a) the decision of the Government of Brazil to decentralize and transfer&#13;
the several subdivisions of the Brazilian Urban Train Company (Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos,&#13;
CBTU) from the Federal to the State/Municipal Governments as mandated by the 1 988 Constitution;&#13;
and (b) the willingness of the State of Pernambuco to takeover the Recife subdivision of the CBTU&#13;
(STU-REC) so as to better integrate it with the predominantly privately-owned bus transport system.&#13;
The GOB started by decentralizing the two largest CBTU subdivisions (Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro),&#13;
and once that was successfully accomplished, it decided to proceed with the decentralization of the&#13;
Belo Horizonte and Recife subdivisions.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.2                 The Bank's country assistance strategy for Brazil, discussed by the Board on&#13;
June 29, 1993, is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic growth and social&#13;
development in a context of macroeconomic stability. The emphasis is on efficient resource allocation,&#13;
increased efficiency in the public sector and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems&#13;
to the poor. The proposed project is fully consistent with this assistance strategy since it is designed&#13;
to: (a) promote reforms and financial viability of public enterprises, including decentralization from&#13;
federal to state and municipal levels; (b) foster private sector participation in the development of new&#13;
infrastructure and its operation; (c) increase the efficiency of infrastructure investments; (d) contribute&#13;
to poverty alleviation; and (e) reduce Government subsidies through improved tariff policies and&#13;
financial management. The proposed project is also a follow-up to the efforts started with the Sao&#13;
Paulo Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3457-BR) and the Rio de Janeiro&#13;
Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3633-BR) which are decentralizing the federally-&#13;
owned CBTU to the States of S.Paulo and Rio to allow for more effective modal and tariff integration.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
2.3                 The objectives of the proposed project are: (a) the development of an integrated&#13;
urban transport system for the RMR under the existing regional transportation coordination commission&#13;
(EMTU) established to coordinate and recommend common policies on pricing, regulation, financing,&#13;
project evaluation and selection; (b) the decentralization (transfer of ownership and operational&#13;
responsibilities) of the STU-REC subdivision from the federal to the state level; (c) the reduction of the&#13;
negative environmental (mainly air quality and noise) impacts on the RMR due to road-based vehicles&#13;
and the promotion of non-motorized transport modes; and (d) the development of special strategies&#13;
and actions to improve the accessibility of the poor to employment centers, health centers and&#13;
education facilities.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
2.4                 The project would consist of three inter-related components: (a) an Infrastructure&#13;
and Equipment component (98.1 percent of total project cost) to help build: (i) the rail extensions /&#13;
traction conversions and the additional stations required to enhance modal integration; and (ii) the&#13;
transfer terminals and physical accesses required for the actual integration between buses, rail,&#13;
pedestrians, automobiles and bicycles; (b) an Environmental and Traffic Safety component (0.2 percent&#13;
of total project cost) to support (i) the design of an inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for&#13;
vehicle emissions and noise; and (ii) the development of a traffic management control and safety&#13;
program particularly in the area of influence of the rail system; and {c) an Institutional and Policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Development component (1 .7 percent of total project cost) to help in: (i) strengthening the EMTU for&#13;
the RMR; (ii) preparing an integrated Transport Policy, Land Use, and Air Quality Management strategy&#13;
for the RMR to meet both transport and air quality targets and to introduce sound cost-recovery, tariff,&#13;
regulatory and subsidy policies; (iii) providing an action plan to improve the financial management of&#13;
the STU-REC; (iv) developing an enabling environment and financial instruments for more substantial&#13;
participation of the private sector in the investment and operation of the operating agencies; and (v)&#13;
strengthening air-quality planning and monitoring of vehicle-based emissions.&#13;
Dl. Project Components&#13;
Part A - Infrastructure and Equipment Component&#13;
2.5                 This component is designed to extend METROREC's Central line from TIP to&#13;
Timbi, to convert the South line from diesel to electricity, to link the South line to the Central line, and&#13;
to separate RFFSA's freight line from the passenger lines (map IBRD 26915 and Annex 5). These&#13;
improvements to STU-REC's infrastructure and equipment will allow it to meet the performance targets&#13;
indicated in Annex 11 and are be summarized below.&#13;
2.6                 Civil Works Program would consist of: (a) Urban Bus Terminals, entailing the&#13;
construction of three terminals in the Center line and seven in the South line; (b) Road Accesses to&#13;
improve the access to selected stations in both lines; (c) Passenger Stations consisting of the&#13;
construction of one station at Timbi on the Central line, ten new stations and modernization of two&#13;
existing stations on the Recife-Cajueiro Seco link of the South line, and minor rehabilitation of five&#13;
stations on the Cajueiro Seco-Cabo section on the South line; and (d) Bridges, Road Viaducts and&#13;
Pedestrian Over/Underpasses including the construction of sixteen bridges, four road viaducts, and ten&#13;
pedestrian over/underpasses.&#13;
2.7                 Permanent Way Program would consist of: (a) works in the Central line, including&#13;
the construction of a 4.5-km double electrified track extension from the TIP terminal station to Timbi;&#13;
and (b) works in the South line, including the construction of 13.5 km of double electrified track from&#13;
Recife to Cajueiro Seco. To carry out these works, provisions have been made for the necessary land&#13;
expropriations and resettlements to: (a) build 500 m of tracks, linking the Central with the South line&#13;
at Recife and Joana Bezerra stations; (b) relocated 11 km of one of the existing tracks from Afogados&#13;
to Cajueiro Seco for exclusive dedication of RFFSA's freight traffic; and (c) construct 11 km of a&#13;
second track from Pontezinha to Cabo.&#13;
2.8                 Systems Program would consist of: (a) an Electric System on the Central line,&#13;
including: (i) circuit breakers; (ii) 4.5 km of transmission lines and overhead catenary; and (iii) relocation&#13;
of feeder lines at Cavaleiro yard; (b) an Electric System on the South line consisting of: (i) 13.5 km of&#13;
overhead catenary; (ii) 14.5 km of transmission lines; and (iii) construction of two sub-stations, two&#13;
sectionalizing cabins; (c) a Signaling Program that requires the installation of: (i) a signaling system on&#13;
the 4.5-km TIP-Timbi extension, with the same characteristics of the signaling system operating in the&#13;
Central line (centralized traffic control (CTC), relay interlocking and automatic train control (ATC)); and&#13;
(ii) track circuits and related elements and remote boxes in the CTC, and eight automatic level crossing&#13;
barriers on the South line; and (c) Telecommunications would include the installation of: (i) a central&#13;
telephone station for the entire network; (ii) a telecommunication system on the TIP-Timbi extension&#13;
on the Central line; and (iii) 13.5 km of fiber optic cable, a VHF radio network, public address system,&#13;
ticketing control, clock and track telephone sub-systems, and a radio communication sub-system at&#13;
five stations in the Cajueiro Seco-Cabo on the South line.&#13;
2.9                 The Workshop Program would consist of: (a) construction of an additional area&#13;
in the Cavaleiro workshop for major overhauls of the electric multiple unit (EMU) fleet; (b) construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of a small maintenance shed for the maintenance of diesel locomotives at Cajueiro Seco; and (c}&#13;
miscellaneous equipment and spare parts for the rolling stock, and maintenance equipment for the&#13;
track and catenary.&#13;
2.10               The Rolling Stock program would include: (a) general overhaul of 25 EMUs and&#13;
11 diesel locomotives; (b) rehabilitation and/or modernization of two diesel locomotives; (c) installation&#13;
of air conditioning systems in the EMU fleet; {d) rehabilitation of 21 passenger coaches; and le)&#13;
miscellaneous spare parts for the entire fleet.&#13;
Part B - Environmental and Traffic Safety Program&#13;
2.11               The environmental and traffic safety program will consist of: (a) the design of&#13;
an inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for vehicle emissions and noise to recommend the&#13;
facilities and equipment required to monitor and enforce national/state standards; and (bl the&#13;
development of a comprehensive traffic management and safety program to reduce traffic congestion&#13;
and decrease accidents in the RMR but with particular emphasis on the area of influence of the rail&#13;
system.&#13;
Part C - Institutional Development and Policy&#13;
2.12               STU-REC's decentralization is not by itself a guarantee that the individual&#13;
subdivisions will be better managed than its predecessors. A package of institutional and policy reforms&#13;
are needed to induce modernization changes and motivate management and staff. The financial&#13;
management and administration, especially in regard to cost-recovery mechanisms must also be&#13;
reformed. Otherwise, the cycle for another emergency program of rehabilitation will repeat itself with&#13;
negative impacts on the ridership and on the RMR as a whole. Furthermore, actions are needed to&#13;
change the environment in which STU-REC operates to facilitate the modal integration and&#13;
sustainability desired in the long term. The basic sub-components of the institutional and policy&#13;
package proposed are described in detail in Annex 7 and are summarized below:&#13;
(a) Decentralization. The first set of Actions Plans concerns the actual&#13;
decentralization process: (i) institutional and organizational arrangements; {ii)&#13;
patrimonial-agreement on the valuation and assets to be transferred; (iii)&#13;
aspects relating to transfer of personnel, pension benefits, and&#13;
miscellaneous human resource-related issues; and (iv) legal and&#13;
administrative aspects for decentralization;&#13;
(b) Management. The second set of Action Plans are designed to improve the&#13;
management of the new entity which will succeed STU-REC: {i) preparation&#13;
and implementation of a manpower development and organization plan to&#13;
streamline the management and operations staff in each of the new&#13;
subdivisions that would propose concise job descriptions and staff them&#13;
accordingly; (ii) a study and then implementation of a cost accounting,&#13;
management information systems, and financial management so that timely&#13;
and adequate cost management is possible; (iii) preparation of an action plan&#13;
to improve inventory management since lack of spares is one of the main&#13;
causes for the low rolling stock availability rates; (iv) preparation of an&#13;
action plan to subcontract maintenance and other operations to the private&#13;
sector; (v) preparation of an action plan to increase non-operating revenues&#13;
by renting station space, advertising, and development of subdivision's real&#13;
estate; (g) technical assistance and training for staff at all levels as proposed&#13;
in the manpower development plan; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 1 0 -&#13;
(c) Modal Integration. The objective of the third set of Action Plans is to&#13;
support the policy framework and provide practical recommendations for&#13;
implementing modal integration. This will include studies of existing&#13;
transport agencies with a view to reducing cross inefficiencies, namely: (i)&#13;
a financing mechanisms study focused on achieving formal sources of funds&#13;
for the urban transport sector, including a tariff study to propose multimodal&#13;
tariff integration schemes based on the new route structure along with its&#13;
operationalization; (ii) updating of the Transport, Land Use, and Air Quality&#13;
portion of the Master Plans of the RMR with emphasis on route&#13;
rationalization and modal and tariff integration; and (iii) a study to propose&#13;
changes to EMTU's organization structure in view of its expanded role.&#13;
E. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
2.13               The total cost of the project is estimated US$203.8 million including physical&#13;
and price contingencies, with an estimated foreign component cost of US$103.2 million or 50 percent&#13;
of total cost. Taxes and duties are expected to account for about 13 percent of total cost or US$27.5&#13;
million equivalent. Physical contingencies add up to US$1 6.9 million, or 10 percent of the base cost&#13;
and price contingencies are estimated at US$16.9 million or 9 percent of the base cost plus physical&#13;
contingencies. The contingencies are estimated on the basis of the disbursement schedule (an&#13;
estimated implementation period of six years) and on the following forecast of price escalation for both&#13;
local and foreign expenditures expressed in US dollars: 1.5 percent in 1995, 1.8 percent in 1996, 2.6&#13;
percent in 1997, 2.5 in 1998, 2.5 percent in 1999, 2.5 percent in 2000, and 2.5 percent in 2001.&#13;
Base costs correspond to March 1995 prices. The cost of goods are based upon supplier quotations&#13;
for similar Brazilian-made items and recent prices of imported items. The cost of several components&#13;
of the works program such as, urban bus terminals, passenger stations, bridges, permanent way,&#13;
systems and workshop buildings are based upon preliminary engineering designs and prevailing unit&#13;
prices from recent tenders under Loans 3457-BR and 3633-BR. Cost estimates for consultant services&#13;
are based upon prevailing local and foreign staff-month rates; they provide for the cost of local&#13;
transportation, office equipment and other minor items and, where appropriate, international travel and&#13;
per diem.&#13;
2.14               The project would be financed from the proposed Bank loan of US$102.0 million&#13;
equivalent (50 percent of the total project cost) and GOB contributions of US$101.8 million equivalent,&#13;
including US$27.5 million in taxes and duties (50 percent of the total project cost). During loan&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached on: (a) the project financing plan; and (b) the guarantee of the&#13;
GOB regarding all necessary counterpart funds for the project.&#13;
F. Project Benefits and Risks&#13;
2.15               Project Benefits. Quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits are expected from&#13;
the provision of an integrated rail and bus network including cost savings, time savings for the users,&#13;
fewer accidents and fatalities, and employment generation through better spatial integration of&#13;
markets. Important effects on the urban structure are expected if the STU-REC network becomes an&#13;
axis fed by the major bus routes. In addition, there will be a positive environmental impact through the&#13;
reduction of fossil fuel consumption, reduction of motor-vehicle related emissions, and a reduction in&#13;
road congestion with a consequent improvement in air quality and noise pollution. The project will&#13;
facilitate access to employment and services, particularly for the poor. Development of an integrated&#13;
public transport system under a regional coordination body in charge of combining state and municipal&#13;
pricing and subsidy policies, prioritizing major investments and proposing common demand&#13;
management measures in the RMR, are also important non-quantifiable benefits. Finally, by&#13;
encouraging greater private sector participation in the development of aerial and ground station space,&#13;
the proposed project will be a first step towards decreasing the investment burden on the state. An&#13;
economic evaluation of the project shows an IERR of 27.9 percent for the infrastructure and equipment&#13;
component which represents 98 percent of the project.&#13;

2.16                Project Risks. The main risks involved are the delays in the actual transfer of&#13;
STU-REC ownership to the State, the political reluctance of the State in forcing bus integration due&#13;
to the bus operators' lobby, the possible delays in the procurement process, and the timely availability&#13;
of counterpart funds. To minimize delays in the actual transfer of ownership of the STU-REC to the&#13;
State, the loan agreements link the disbursements with the date set for the transfer. All parties have&#13;
agreed on the need to takeover the system and for an integrated network which will be implemented&#13;
as the key stations become available for operation. At this stage, there is strong commitment to the&#13;
environmental and safety program from the governments involved. The delays in the procurement&#13;
process were minimized by starting at pre-appraisal the pre-qualification for lots in the critical path of&#13;
project implementation, by the use of standard bidding documents, and by requiring the borrower to&#13;
produce the major tender documents by negotiations. The timely availability of counterpart funds will&#13;
be addressed by seeking assurances that they are included in the GOB's CY96 budget and subsequent&#13;
years.&#13;
G. Tariff Setting and Affordability by Low-income Users&#13;
2.17                Poverty, Affordability and Subsidies. The growing crisis in urban transportation&#13;
in Brazil, especially in the MRs, demands a close look at alternatives for financing services in a more&#13;
predictable and sustainable way while, at the same time, targeting subsidies more directly to low-&#13;
income ridership. The various initiatives already underway within STU-REC to improve efficiency&#13;
through tariff increases, service improvements and trip reliability, as well as efforts focused on&#13;
reducing operating costs, are planned to continue while the implementation of the proposed project&#13;
takes place.&#13;
2.1 8               Approximately 87 percent of the urban population earns less than three minimum&#13;
salaries (US$300/month). If successfully implemented, the project will primarily benefit the poor in the&#13;
RMR, since they depend mainly on bus and rail services to commute to and from work, especially those&#13;
living in the "favelas" for whom access to the areas of employment is a daily ordeal.&#13;
2.19                To make urban transport affordable to the poor, it is necessary to strengthen&#13;
and expand the eligibility of the vale-transporte program to low-income residents which are not formally&#13;
employed, to substantially promote integrated (bus-rail) fares, which should always be lower than the&#13;
sum of individual fares, and to increase the overall level of service provided to the users. This will imply&#13;
lower travel times due to higher frequencies and operating speeds, bringing down therefore, the overall&#13;
transport cost to the user and thus alleviating the burden that urban transportation imposes on poor&#13;
households. It is noteworthy that annual bus and train passenger surveys indicate even low-income&#13;
riders are willing to pay higher tariffs if the service provided is faster, waiting times are less, and the&#13;
system is more reliable.&#13;
2.20                Review of Financing Mechanisms. During project preparation it was agreed that&#13;
efforts should be focused on seeking solutions that would: (a) generate sufficient resources to maintain&#13;
stable and predictable funding for urban transport investments; (b) establish mechanisms to generate&#13;
adequate operating cross-subsidies from transport-related taxes, user charges, etc. so as to provide&#13;
adequate coverage for operating deficits; and (c) use a study undertaken by consultants to make&#13;
concrete recommendations and propose draft legislation on financing mechanisms.&#13;
2.21                In the meantime, agreement was reached at negotiations so that: (a) prior to the&#13;
transfer of STU-REC to the State, the GOB will meet the cost of capital investments plus debt service&#13;
(interest and amortization) of the STU-REC incurred before the transfer; (b) during the period prior to&#13;
the transfer, the GOB will cover the difference between the working costs and operating revenues of&#13;
STU-REC; and (c) that after the transfer is effected, the GOB operating subsidy (shortfall between&#13;
operating revenues and working expenses) will be discontinued.&#13;
&#13;

H. Project Economic Evaluation&#13;
2.22                A standard cost-benefit analysis was performed to evaluate the economic impact&#13;
of the implementation of the proposed South line modernization and extension and the construction&#13;
of the TIP-Timbi link, which together represent 98 percent of the total cost of the proposed project.&#13;
Direct user benefits include travel time and operating costs savings; indirect benefits arise from the&#13;
reduction of negative externalities such as accident and air pollution costs. Investments which will be&#13;
avoided due to the implementation of the proposed project are also considered as benefits. Investment&#13;
costs comprise civil works, land expropriation, operational systems, rolling stock and project studies.&#13;
2.23                Substantial direct benefits are expected to arise from travel time savings,&#13;
operating cost savings, bus system control savings, and road maintenance cost savings. Travel time&#13;
savings result mainly from the transfer of bus passengers into the modernized system and from existing&#13;
STU-REC passengers who can save time in their trips by taking advantage of the new transport facility.&#13;
Travel time savings also result from the increased operating speeds and shorter trips of the buses and&#13;
cars which will be feeding the rail system. Operating cost savings for the non-rail modes derive&#13;
principally from the improved commercial and traffic speeds, which can be achieved by buses and cars,&#13;
respectively. In addition, indirect benefits will arise from the reduction in negative externalities, such&#13;
as accidents and air pollution.&#13;
2.24                The IERRs obtained in the economic evaluation are summarized in the Table 2.2.&#13;
For the South line component, the worst scenario (12.9 percent IERR) is caused by an increase of 80&#13;
percent in construction costs. The best scenario 26.7 percent IERR) is given by a 10 percent increase&#13;
in the value of time. For the TIP-Timbi link the worst scenario (17.9 percent IERR) assumes an 80&#13;
percent increase in construction costs. The best scenario (33.1 percent IERR) assumes a 10 percent&#13;
increase in the value of time.&#13;

I. Project Financial Evaluation&#13;
2.25          STU-REC. STU-REC has historically relied on the Federal Government to finance its&#13;
operational deficits and its capital program. These operational deficits have been attributed to low&#13;
traffic, a social tariff imposed by the Government, not enough compensation for free ridership granted&#13;
by law, significant rates of evasion (South line), and high operating costs. The service in the South line&#13;
is generally poor and infrequent due to insufficient security in the right-of-way and a large number of&#13;
level crossings which prohibit frequent and fast service. Furthermore, the South line does not extend&#13;
to the center of the city and does not provide for integration with other modes of transport especially&#13;
the Central line. In 1994, the South line accounted for about 4 million trips or about 12 percent of&#13;
STU-REC's total traffic volume. The demand on the Central line is also low because of insufficient&#13;
integrated stations. As a result of these low volumes of traffic and low tariffs, in 1 994, STU-REC could&#13;
barely earn enough money to cover 1 8 percent of its working cost. High labor costs which accounted&#13;
for 77 percent of the working costs also contributed to the poor working ratio of 5.62. The GOB's&#13;
operational subsidy in 1994 was US$40 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
2.26         Upon completion of the proposed Bank project, service on the South line is expected&#13;
to improve because of enhanced security on the permanent way and in the stations as well as from&#13;
the removal of at-grade crossings. With the extension of the South line to the Center line and the&#13;
construction of integrated stations on both lines, traffic is expected to increase more than 200 percent&#13;
between 1 994-2001. Additional revenue would be provided by increasing tariffs 75 percent between&#13;
1994-2001 and another 12.5 percent between 2001-2005. On the other hand, increases in working&#13;
costs are limited to 5 percent during this period because of a reduction in total staff which is expected&#13;
to decease the personnel expenses by 3 percent during 1994-2001. By 2001, the working ratio is&#13;
expected to improve to 1.11 and the cost recovery should be 94 percent. Performance targets to&#13;
monitor STU-REC's financial situation during the project are given below:&#13;

2.27         State of Pernambuco. In 1993 PE had current revenues (own sources plus constitutional&#13;
transfers) of US$1,064 million of which about 64 percent were from the State's own resources and&#13;
the rest was contractual from the Federal Government. To augment the State's own revenues,&#13;
Pernambuco also received US$83 million in federal grants that year. On the expenditure side, personnel&#13;
expense was only 38 percent of total current expenditure or 54 percent of net current revenue (current&#13;
revenue less constitutional transfers) which is considerably less than the legally mandated maximum&#13;
of 65 percent. Nearly 1 5 percent of expenditures were transfers to the municipalities and the rest to&#13;
state enterprises and the social security fund. Total capital expenditure of US$176 million was a&#13;
meager US$25 per capita.&#13;
2.28         Transfer of the STU-REC to the State will force the burden of providing operational&#13;
subsides on the State. Given the requirement of operational subsidy by STU-REC, between 1996-2000,&#13;
the State will have to add another US$30-35 million to the current level of transfers to state&#13;
enterprises or an increase of 14-16 percent over that in 1993. Starting in 2001, the subsidy&#13;
requirements are expected to fall by about two-thirds to US$10 million (US$7 million if the non-&#13;
operational income of STU-REC were also to be considered). The annual subsidy requirement during&#13;
2001-2005 would thus be less than 1 percent of the total current revenue. It is worth nothing that the&#13;
1 993 current account surplus equaled the projected subsidy in 2001. The State is also expected to&#13;
compensate STU-REC US$3-4 million per year for carrying gratuitos (free riders) during the projection&#13;
period. This compensation should, however, not be considered a subsidy as it refers to purchase of&#13;
STU-REC's services by the government.&#13;
J. Environmental Impact of the Project&#13;
2.29         Since the main objective of the proposed project is to increase the capacity offered by&#13;
the RMR rail system, it is expected that a substantial percentage of the passengers now carried by bus&#13;
will return to their original mode of transportation, that is, rail. This is especially true for passengers&#13;
who live within walking distance from the stations, who switched to bus because in the last five years&#13;
the capacity and safety offered by the trains decreased considerably. However, it is not so obvious for&#13;
those passengers who are not within walking distance. Nevertheless, it is estimated that by project&#13;
completion about 285 fewer buses/day will be required in the streets of the RMR, because the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
integration with rail will shorten the present bus routes. The main expected positive environmental&#13;
impacts stem from this reduction in bus services, given their present negative impact on the air quality,&#13;
noise levels, traffic congestion, and road accidents. As discussed below, other positive impacts include&#13;
the effect of the rail system rehabilitation on passenger safety at the stations, on the land use around&#13;
the right of way, and the decrease of fatal accidents resulting from lack of fencing along the right-of-&#13;
way&#13;
2.30         The impact on air quality is due to a reduction of emission by the buses which will be&#13;
removed from circulation or which will have their route-kms shortened because they will be operating&#13;
feeder services for the rail system rather than duplicating their routes. The impact on air quality was&#13;
estimated at US$0.59 million per year in RMR. A positive impact on noise levels is also due to the&#13;
removal of buses, especially in Recife, where the older vehicles predominantly owned by the public&#13;
sector are noisy and when bunched together, cause very high decibel (dB) levels, which hardly allow&#13;
people to speak at normal voice levels on the street. The impact on traffic congestion was&#13;
conservatively estimated at US$20.3 million per year in Recife and is mainly due to the shorter waiting&#13;
time for commuters using their automobiles and buses and also due to the savings in fuel consumption&#13;
since the vehicles consume more when they are idle. The effect on road accidents is based on&#13;
statistics which suggest that, in the metropolitan region, the number of bus accidents is a function of&#13;
the number of buses on the road. It is estimated that the savings due to fewer accidents are US$0.56&#13;
million per year in Recife. In addition, the fencing of the right-of-way is expected to decrease the&#13;
number of fatal accidents due to people crossing the tracks. Even if the benefits estimated were cut&#13;
in half because the bus operators would, in some cases, continue to run the buses at lower load&#13;
factors, the project would contribute positively to the environment. Benefits which were not quantified&#13;
are those related to the improved living environment which will result from safer and cleaner stations,&#13;
crossovers from the sidewalks to the stations, space for queuing up at the wickets, ramps for the&#13;
handicapped, and in some cases, modal integration with taxis, buses and private automobiles. Other&#13;
non-quantified benefits are those related to the structuring effect of a revamped rail system which will&#13;
attract housing in the surrounding areas. Furthermore, real estate development on the air space above&#13;
the stations and on land owned by CBTU is also expected. Additional non-quantified benefits relate to&#13;
the diminished stress which the road system and congestion will impart on the road users and the&#13;
better ambience expected in trains. Shorter trip times and faster home-to-work trips will also have a&#13;
positive effect on the rail users' welfare.&#13;
J1. Environmental Impact of the Construction&#13;
2.31         The proposed extension of the system will have only limited negative environmental&#13;
impacts. Most materials used will not affect the environment; the contractors will be responsible for&#13;
proper disposal of old materials; the earthworks are mainly in CBTU's existing right-of-way. Wooden&#13;
ties will only be procured from contractors who are allowed by their national agencies to sell them and,&#13;
wherever feasible, concrete ties will be used. The visual impact of the stations will be enhanced with&#13;
appropriate architectural designs which will blend with the environment, and the same will be done&#13;
with the overhead catenary, wherever possible. Assurances will be sought that the project will be&#13;
executed, and the system subsequently operated in accordance with Bank guidelines and sound&#13;
environmental practices.&#13;
2.32         An environmental impact assessment of the TIP-Timbi and South line links undertaken&#13;
by independent consultants is required by Brazilian law. A preliminary analysis following Bank&#13;
guidelines was provided during the Bank mission in March 1 995 and has been reviewed and&#13;
subsequently approved by the Bank. During pre-appraisal, the following were made available: (a) a&#13;
typology of the affected population and of proposed solutions; (b) the institutional matrix, which&#13;
supports the expropriation process, specifying for each activity the responsibilities of CBTU's various&#13;
units as well as those of other agencies and the relationship of social and environmental management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
within the overall project coordination arrangements; (c) a chronogram of all activities pertaining to&#13;
expropriation and related activities to be carried out by CBTU or other agencies; including consultations&#13;
with the affected population and the possibilities of delays in beginning of construction if compensation&#13;
offered to the affected population were to be rejected; and (d) a budget estimate and sources of funds&#13;
required for expropriation and other related activities.&#13;
2.33         The terms of reference for preparing the final engineering designs for future stations&#13;
and proposed terminals require that existing environmental (noise and visual intrusion) conditions be&#13;
reviewed and that the final designs include specific measures for alleviating conditions where they fail&#13;
to meet existing or proposed standards. In addition, an environmental assessment will be required on&#13;
all proposals for new works, indicating any adverse environmental consequences and proposing&#13;
measures to eliminate them or at least reduce their impact to acceptable levels. These assessments&#13;
and proposals will relate principally to vehicle emissions, vehicle noise, and visual intrusion.&#13;
2.34         To ensure that environmental impacts are properly evaluated and adequate mitigating&#13;
measures are proposed, CBTU's Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would hire a firm of experienced&#13;
professionals in resettlement as well as have environmental specialists in charge of reviewing and&#13;
monitoring all phases of project preparation and implementation. CBTU has accumulated some&#13;
experience with land expropriation during the construction of the Central line. More specifically, CBTU&#13;
would: (a) ensure that terms of reference (TOR) for feasibility studies include a preliminary&#13;
environmental impact evaluation or screening of the proposed solutions; (b) review the feasibility&#13;
studies and determine, according to sound environmental practices, whether a specific and detailed&#13;
environmental impact assessment and development of mitigation measures, such as a relocation plan,&#13;
are required; (c) hire consultants to carry out appropriate analyses and propose mitigation measures;&#13;
(d) in the latter case, seek the Bank's approval for the proposed measures; (e) include the proposed&#13;
measures in the TOR for final engineering design, review the final engineering design from an&#13;
environmental standpoint, and clear the project for implementation; and (f) supervise the&#13;
implementation of the project to ensure that the participating operating agencies carry it out in&#13;
accordance with the design approved by CBTU. Since all the project designs will be financed and&#13;
approved by CBTU, it is expected that this arrangement will ensure that subcomponents are carried&#13;
out according to environmental practices acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
J2. Population Relocation&#13;
2.35         This project has been rated "B" by the Bank for environmental assessment (EA)&#13;
purposes. As such, only selective evaluation and proposals for mitigation of environmentally or socially&#13;
relevant impacts are required by the Bank for appraisal. However, in accordance with Brazilian&#13;
legislation, a full EA was prepared. TORs were developed by CBTU in consultation with the state&#13;
licensing agency, Companhia Pernambucana de Controle a Poluicao Ambiental e de Administracao de&#13;
Recursos Hidricos (CPRH). The extension of the TIP-Timbi link (4.5 km, one station at Timbi) and the&#13;
extension of the South line (13.5 km, 10 stations) was analyzed by an independent consulting firm.&#13;
A consulting firm has been hired and work started in December 1994 and was concluded in mid-April&#13;
1995. CBTU has also hired independent resettlement and environmental assessment specialists to&#13;
assist in project preparation.&#13;
2.36         CBTU is an experienced company and engineering designs are well advanced.&#13;
Preparation of assessments and the design of programs addressing environmental and social impacts&#13;
have only recently begun due to the requirements of the project cycle, which call for these activities&#13;
to be carried out only after an expropriation decree is issued. This decree in turn depends on a precise&#13;
definition of the location and area requirements of all facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.37          At-grade or elevated structures will be used along the full extent of the South to Central&#13;
link, significantly reducing expropriation requirements and environmental impacts as compared to&#13;
traditional cut-and-cover methods. Stations have similarly been designed with special attention to&#13;
reducing above-ground space requirements. Locations (i.e., buildings and plots) which need to be&#13;
acquired to implement the Bank-financed segments are at this point clearly identified. Table 2.4&#13;
summarizes their distribution by site and use.&#13;
2.38          Whereas the initial layout at-grade called for the acquisition of more buildings and plots,&#13;
alternative sites and designs and an elevated structure of 500 meters to link the South and Central&#13;
lines were sought in an attempt to minimize public acquisition. The current proposal has clearly&#13;
managed to minimize project impact. Of the 495 locations to be expropriated, 1 57 are middle-to-low&#13;
income houses. 275 are "favela houses," 49 are small shops and 14 are industrial establishments. The&#13;
total affected population is estimated to be under 1,980 people.&#13;

2.39          CBTU's usual practice in the case of middle-income residences is to expropriate at&#13;
market value, which is established according to criteria defined by ABNT (Associacao Brasileira de&#13;
Normas Tecnicas) in accordance with local real estate transactions. The CBTU's Civil Works&#13;
Department follows a standard set of internal procedures, comprising preparation of a physical&#13;
cadastre, calculation of the asset's value, and presentation of CBTU's purchase proposal to the&#13;
proprietor. The Legal Department carries out the purchase if the stipulated price is accepted by the&#13;
proprietor, or takes the case to court if an agreement is not reached. Over the past 20 years, CBTU&#13;
has carried out over 5,000 expropriations. In roughly 70 percent of these, the proposed buying price&#13;
was accepted. The adequacy of compensation at market value is not difficult to establish since&#13;
monitoring and evaluation studies to verify how the affected population relocated were carried out for&#13;
the line which is in operation. In case of "favela" houses, the practice adopted is either to resettle the&#13;
affected population to houses which are equal or better than the ones expropriated-preferably to sites&#13;
which are close to the ones being affected-or to offer a financial compensation for those families&#13;
which prefer to receive money instead of being relocated. The company also provides, in the case of&#13;
low-income families, assistance in finding replacement housing, logistical support for moving, legal&#13;
support to regularize property titles, relocation grants and other services. The total amount estimated&#13;
for resettlement and expropriation was estimated at US$7.8 million plus contingencies. This amount&#13;
has been included in the project costs and will be fully financed by the GOB.&#13;
2.40           An Environmental Assessment Report, following Bank guidelines, including a detailed&#13;
resettlement plan wherever it is applicable, was prepared and approved by the Bank in April 1 995. To&#13;
prepare the report: (a) a meeting with residents was held to present and discuss project characteristics,&#13;
expropriation requirements and other relevant impacts, expropriation procedures and timing, proposed&#13;
valuation criteria and other forms of compensation and assistance (see para. (d) below); (b) minutes&#13;
of the meeting were sent to the Bank; (c) the exact number and socio-economic profile of affected&#13;
families was finalized; (d) a clear policy statement pertaining to the concession of other grants and&#13;
services which the company will make available to the affected population was also competed,&#13;
including addressing the case of non-proprietors; (e) the final version of the expropriation program,&#13;
including compensation and mitigation actions, institutional matrix, chronogram, budget, funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
arrangements, all reflecting agreements reached with the affected population, was made available prior&#13;
to negotiations; and (f) a monitoring and evaluation program was presented prior to negotiations, to&#13;
be carried out until the conclusion of the relocation process of all households. Evidence that the State&#13;
licensing agency has approved the environmental impact statement and has issued the license to&#13;
initiate the works in the South line is a condition of loan disbursement. It is a condition of disbursement&#13;
for the TIP-Timbi link that the State licensing agency issues the license to initiate its construction.&#13;
K. Private Sector Participation&#13;
2.41         To examine the financial instruments which can encourage private participation in the&#13;
construction and operation of selected parts of the mass transit systems, CBTU has created a high-&#13;
level working group of entrepreneurs and financiers. Many aspects of this program appear to be&#13;
appropriate for private or joint public/private development, which could result in considerable savings.&#13;
Station development is the most obvious, but consideration should also be given to leasing of some&#13;
existing stations and transfer points for private sector development and operation. Disposition of&#13;
excess railway land, and air rights would also be explored. CBTU has invited a high-level group,&#13;
including respected outsiders such as elected officials, investment bankers, prominent developers, civil&#13;
works contractors, and Chamber of Commerce representatives, to explore this as well as other ways&#13;
to -capture- some of the added value of railway real estate development and prepare proposals for&#13;
inclusion in the program.&#13;
2.42         It was agreed between CBTU and the Bank that to foster the participation of the private&#13;
sector in the system, the Shareholder's Agreement will contain a clause which will require that the&#13;
State will cause the PE Entity to offer to the private sector, through at least four invitations to bid,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, the exploitation of trains, station space, aerial space, parking areas, automatic&#13;
ticket collection, and other areas. The first bid should be launched not later than one year after the&#13;
transfer of STU-REC.&#13;
&#13;

IIl. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
3.1          The Government of Brazil will be the Borrower. CBTU will be responsible for&#13;
implementing the project, in accordance with: (a) contractual arrangements; (b) the implementation&#13;
schedule; (c) implementation arrangements; (d) the decentralization implementation process; (e)&#13;
procurement arrangements; (f) disbursement arrangements; (g) auditing arrangements; and (h)&#13;
monitoring and reporting arrangements. These arrangements were confirmed during negotiations, and&#13;
detailed guidelines, satisfactory to the Bank, will be prepared by CBTU. The Bank will monitor the&#13;
implementation of the project in accordance with a monitoring and supervision plan (Annex 11).&#13;
3.2          The overall coordination and supervision of the proposed project will rest with the&#13;
CBTU, which has established a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) supported by consultants. CBTU and&#13;
the State agreed that the PIU will continue to manage the execution of the project after the transfer&#13;
of the STU-REC system to the State. This will ensure the continuity of project management experience&#13;
acquired with the ongoing Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Transport Decentralization&#13;
projects, and will prevent delays which could occur due to a change of the project implementation&#13;
team before the conclusion of the project. To manage and guide the 'non-hardware' aspects (political,&#13;
legal, administrative, institutional, and so forth) through the transition and until December 1 996, an&#13;
intergovernmental General Coordination Committee will coordinate the work of a number of task&#13;
forces, which will carry out strategic studies on terms of reference agreed with the Bank during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
B. Contractual Arrangements&#13;
3.3          In order to ensure a smooth transition to decentralization, (the formal legal transfer and&#13;
start of operations by the PE Entity), and to support its subsequent consolidation, the following legal&#13;
arrangements will apply:&#13;
With the Bank:&#13;
Bank and GOB       (Borrower)                        Loan Agreement&#13;
Bank and CBTU      (Executing Agency)                Project Agreement&#13;
Bank and PE        (State of PE)                     Shareholder's Agreement&#13;
Between governments and agencies:&#13;
GOB and PE         (Convenio Basico and Termos Aditivos)&#13;
CBTU and PE Entity  (Decentralization Contract)&#13;
C. Implementation Schedule&#13;
3.4          The implementation of this project has been tentatively scheduled over a six-year&#13;
calendar period (1995-2001). The project would be completed by June 30, 2001 and the closing date&#13;
would be December 31, 2001. The Bank has recommended that CBTU should take special care in&#13;
finalizing the project implementation schedule, which is directly linked to the procurement process, and&#13;
indicated that according to the Bank's experience, the bidding process for each bid may take from 7&#13;
to 12 months, including the approval of bidding documents, advertisement in the Development&#13;
Business journal and local press, bid evaluation, recommendations for award, contract signature, and&#13;
contract effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
D. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.5          Project Implementation Unit. CBTU will establish and maintain a Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU) headed by a Project Coordinator to manage the implementation of the several components&#13;
of the Bank project. The Project Coordinator would report directly to CBTU's President. Project&#13;
Management and implementation consultants financed under Part C of the project would act as full-&#13;
time advisers to the Project Coordinator to provide the technical support and cross-country experience&#13;
required for managing the project. These consultants should be hired immediately after pre-appraisal.&#13;
In addition to the Project Coordinator who will be responsible for the overall financial management of&#13;
the project, the PIU will include: (a) a transport economist and policy studies coordinator responsible&#13;
for overseeing the execution of all the studies and transport economics aspects of Parts B and C of&#13;
the project; (b} an engineer, with experience in procurement, to coordinate part A of the project; (c)&#13;
a management information systems specialist responsible for the reporting and supervision of the&#13;
project; and (d) a resettlement specialist. The PIU would be supported by a small secretariat which&#13;
would include an accountant responsible for project accounts and disbursements.&#13;
3.6          PE Entity Project Management Unit. This Project Management Unit (PEE/PMU) will be&#13;
the counterpart of the PIU in STU-REC, and will follow closely the procurement, implementation and&#13;
supervision of the PE Entity related works and acquisition of goods.&#13;
E. Decentralization Process&#13;
3.7          The transfer of the STU-REC subdivision from the GOB to the State of Pernambuco has&#13;
been agreed through the execution of an Agreement of Intent (Convenio Basico) on June 1, 1 995. This&#13;
agreement was reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfactory.&#13;
3.8          Transitional Phase to Decentralization. As the successful decentralization transfer will&#13;
be subject to detailed negotiations, and will involve political considerations in addition to financial and&#13;
technical issues, the detailed steps and transition to decentralization are viewed as a dynamic process&#13;
involving the full and transparent participation of all levels of government. In order to support this&#13;
process, joint and parallel strategic studies, administrative and legal actions, organizational changes,&#13;
and key political decisions will have to be undertaken in a logical and sequential manner, and&#13;
synchronized with the timetable for processing and executing the proposed Bank Loan and eventually&#13;
for transfer of the system to PE no later than the target date of December 31, 1 996. The following&#13;
steps should be included:&#13;
(a)    General Coordination and Completion of Strategic Studies. Immediately following the&#13;
signing of the Convenio Basico, the General Coordination Committee (CG) will manage&#13;
and guide the decentralization process. The CG will incorporate a number of task&#13;
forces. The CG, with representatives from the CBTU and PE, will report to the&#13;
Conselho Diretor through the Representantes Executivos. The task forces will work on&#13;
the strategic studies and Actions Plans outlined in the Convenio Basico.&#13;
(b)    Transfer to Public Corporation. In accordance with the Federal Government's policy for&#13;
modernization of the economy, and PE's long-standing tradition for efficiency, the STU-&#13;
REC will be transferred to a Public Corporation (Sociedade Anonima de Economia Mista&#13;
known as the PE Entity). Assurances were sought at Negotiations that not later than&#13;
June 30, 1 996, PE would set up such Public Corporation, under an independent Board&#13;
with management autonomy, and thereafter, not later than December 31, 1996, the&#13;
STU-REC will be fully transferred to the Corporation. The articles of incorporation&#13;
would include, among other things, that: (i) the Corporation will be managed by&#13;
professionally-trained Chief Executive Officers; (ii) the management will adhere to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
specific operating financial and performance targets set forth in annual contract plans;&#13;
(iii) management will abide by agreed personnel and administrative policies; and (iv) the&#13;
Corporation will follow sound commercial practices. Draft Articles for the Corporation&#13;
will be reviewed by the Bank.&#13;
3.9           Timetable and Phasing for Decentralization. The project has been prepared to take into&#13;
account the Federal Government's objective to complete the legal and institutional transfer&#13;
(Decentralization) of the STU-REC by the target date of December 31, 1996, or when 60 percent of&#13;
the loan funds have been disbursed (which ever is earlier). The term "Transfer" means the transfer of&#13;
ownership and operational responsibilities of the STU-REC System to the PE Entity including the&#13;
enactment and execution of all legal, contractual and administrative acts and documents required under&#13;
the legislation of the Borrower and the State for these purposes.&#13;
F. Procurement&#13;
3.10          All project components financed under the proposed Bank loan would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995).&#13;
3.11          Procurement procedures would be as follows:&#13;
(a)    contracts for goods estimated to cost more than US$350,000 equivalent and&#13;
contracts for works including civil works, systems, permanent way and rolling&#13;
stock, estimated to cost more than US$5.0 million equivalent would be&#13;
procured through ICB procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines. In ICB&#13;
procurement of goods, domestic manufacturers may be granted a margin of&#13;
preference by adding 1 5 percent (or the applicable custom duties, whichever&#13;
is lower) to the CIF value of the foreign bids.1' Although it is not foreseen, the&#13;
procurement of some goods valued below US$350,000 would be through&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$0.5 million;&#13;
(b)    works of US$5.0 million equivalent or less, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$21.0 million (Table 3.1) would be awarded through national competitive&#13;
bidding procedures and foreign bidders would have the opportunity to compete.&#13;
In addition: (i) project components for civil works and systems, permanent&#13;
way, and rolling stock have been packaged, and would be procured under&#13;
supply and installation procedures; and (ii) prequalification procedures would&#13;
be followed for the supply and installation of the signaling component; and&#13;
(c)    consultants, which are expected to aggregate to about US$12.6 million&#13;
(including supervision of investments under the project), would be selected and&#13;
engaged following the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August&#13;
1981) using the Bank's standard contract form for complex assignments.&#13;
1/    A local bidder is a Brazilian firm (or a consortium) offering goods containing components manufactured in Brazil and&#13;
representing at least 50 percent of the value of the goods.&#13;

satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) standard contract forms for consulting services issued by the Bank&#13;
for complex, time-based consulting assignments. The procurement schedule for major contracts is&#13;
shown in Annex 8, Table 8.5.&#13;
3.13            Procurement Review. All contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of&#13;
US$350,000 or more, and all contracts for works estimated to cost US$5.0 million or more would be&#13;
subject to the Bank's prior review of the procurement documentation (advertising, bidding documents,&#13;
bid evaluation and contract award). The total value of these contracts would be US$154.2 million and&#13;
would represent about 83 percent of all Bank-financed goods and civil works. CBTU's management&#13;
have the capabilities to handle adequately the procurement processes required for this project.&#13;
Procurement information would be recorded as follows: (a) prompt reporting of contract award by the&#13;
borrower; and (b) comprehensive biannual reports to the Bank by the borrower, indicating: (i) revised&#13;
cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates of allowances for&#13;
physical and price contingencies; (ii) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising,&#13;
bidding, contract awards, and completion time for individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with&#13;
aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;

G. Disbursement and Special Account&#13;
3.14                All disbursements under contracts of less than US$5.0 million equivalent for&#13;
works and systems and less than US$350,000 equivalent for goods would be made on the basis of&#13;
certified statements of expenditures (SOEs) prepared by CBTU. SOE limits for consultant services&#13;
contracts would be US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. Supporting documentation&#13;
for the SOEs would be retained by CBTU and made available for examination by Bank staff during&#13;
supervision missions. To expedite project execution, a Special Account would be opened in a&#13;
commercial bank under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank with an authorized allocation of&#13;
up to US$6 million equivalent. This account will be replenished for the amount of withdrawals on&#13;
account of eligible expenditures. Authorization is sought for retroactive financing of up to US$10&#13;
million equivalent (10 percent of loan funds) in accordance with the Bank's standard guidelines. This&#13;
retroactive financing would be for expenditures made after March 31, 1995, but no earlier than 12&#13;
months prior to loan signing(expected date October 31, 1995). Claims for retroactive financing would&#13;
have to be made no later three months after loan effectiveness. The disbursement arrangements were&#13;
discussed and agreed during negotiations. Table 3.3 presents the percentage to be disbursed by loan&#13;
category.&#13;

H. Auditing&#13;
3.15                    CBTU would prepare financial statements, the Special Account audit, and the&#13;
SOE's audit using external auditors acceptable to the Bank. The Bank would review the external&#13;
auditors' terms of reference. CBTU's audit report and the audit report of the PE Entity would be&#13;
presented to the Bank annually no later than June 30 of each year. The project auditing arrangements&#13;
were discussed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
I. Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
3.16                    Annual Review and Project Plan of Action. In November of each year, the Bank,&#13;
CBTU and the PE would conduct a formal joint review of the progress made in reaching the objectives&#13;
and in the implementation of the proposed project. The annual review would provide an opportunity&#13;
to discuss project issues, in particular:  compliance with covenants; institutional development&#13;
advancements and performance of CBTU, implementing agencies, and technical assistance; execution&#13;
and analysis of further needs of the training program; the quality of subproject implementation,&#13;
including environmental analyses; implementation of studies, sector policies and actions; and the&#13;
implementation of a monitoring program (proposed monitoring indicators are presented in Annex 11).&#13;
The discussion and analysis of the issues addressed during the year under review would lead to the&#13;
formulation of adjustments and, if necessary, remedial actions satisfactory to the Bank. The timing and&#13;
scope of the annual review was confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
3.17                    The project places great emphasis on institutional development in the sector&#13;
and as such, implementation must be closely monitored and evaluated. It is proposed that a Mid-term&#13;
Review of the project be held 24 months after loan effectiveness. At the review, the performance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
the project would be assessed and the second period implementation program would be amended as&#13;
necessary based on the results of that evaluation.&#13;
3.18                Reporting. It was agreed during appraisal, and confirmed at negotiations, that&#13;
CBTU with the assistance of participating operating agencies, would prepare biannual progress reports&#13;
on June 30 and December 31 of each year and submit them within 60 days. The reports would cover&#13;
past institutional development and project execution achievements and compare them with the&#13;
appraisal projections and goals set forth in Annex 11. They would present a critical assessment of&#13;
problems and issues arising during project execution. The reports would also discuss compliance with&#13;
dated covenants and other conditions by each agency and actions taken to enforce compliance. In&#13;
cases of unsatisfactory progress, the reports would also describe proposals for adjustments and&#13;
remedial actions. The case for more periodic (quarterly) reporting would be reviewed at the Mid-term&#13;
Review. To facilitate adequate monitoring of the project, CBTU has agreed to install no later than 90&#13;
days after loan signing a management information system to track the physical, financial and&#13;
environmental status of each component of the project.&#13;
J. Project Supervision&#13;
3.19                The responsibilities for supervising project implementation and a supervision&#13;
plan are shown in Annex 11. It is expected that at least three supervision missions per year staffed&#13;
by an urban transport engineer/planner, a railway engineer, a metro infrastructure engineer, and a&#13;
resettlement specialist and a financial analyst will be required to supervise the proposed project during&#13;
the first three years of execution (1995-1998). In addition, specialists in traffic engineering and&#13;
procurement would accompany the supervision missions as required. Supervision requirements are&#13;
expected to be intensive, particularly in the initial years, as Bank missions would aim to visit every&#13;
operating agency at least once a year. For the first three years, the supervision requirements are&#13;
estimated at about 20 staff weeks, reducing to 1 3 staff weeks in the fourth year, and 1 2 staff weeks&#13;
in the fifth and sixth years.&#13;

IV. PROJECT AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
4.1           The following Project Management assurances were obtained at appraisal and&#13;
confirmed at negotiations:&#13;
(a)        that the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be structured and adequately staffed and&#13;
otherwise supported in the implementation of its responsibility under the project. CBTU&#13;
provided the Bank with the names and curricula vitae of the staff assigned to the PIU&#13;
(para. 3.5);&#13;
(b)        that Procurement will be carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines, including: (i)&#13;
the use of standard bidding documents for the procurement of goods and works, under&#13;
NCB and ICB procedures; (ii) use of Bank's guidelines for the selection of consultants;&#13;
and (iii) the procurement limits (para. 3.11);&#13;
(c)        that a Special Account in a commercial bank will be opened and maintained (para.&#13;
3.14);&#13;
(d)        that the Special Account and Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) (i) will be audited&#13;
according to procedures, and by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (ii)&#13;
audits will be submitted by April 30 of each year (para. 3.15);&#13;
(e)        that: (i) within 90 days of loan signing a Project Management Information System&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank be installed; (ii) pre-agreed operational and financial&#13;
performance targets will be included in biannual reports to the Bank (para. 3.18);&#13;
(f)        that the project will be executed, and the system subsequently operated in accordance&#13;
with sound environmental practices (para. 2.31); and&#13;
(g)        that the Environmental Assessment for the South line and the TIP-Timbi link be&#13;
submitted to the Bank as well as State and Municipal Authorities (para. 2.40).&#13;
4.2           The Convenio Basico satisfactory to the Bank and completion of final engineering and&#13;
technical specifications of works and goods for the first year of the program were submitted to the&#13;
Bank during negotiations.&#13;
4.3          The following is a Condition of Loan Effectiveness: the registration of the Loan&#13;
Agreement by the Central Bank (para. 3.14).&#13;
4.4          The following are Conditions of Disbursement for the South line and the TIP-Timbi link&#13;
respectively:&#13;
(a)        the approval by the State and Municipal environmental authorities of the Environmental&#13;
Assessment of the South line and evidence that the license to build has been issued&#13;
by those authorities (para. 2.40);&#13;
(b)        the approval of the Environmental Assessment for the TIP-Timbi link by the State and&#13;
Municipal authorities and the granting of the necessary licenses for the works (para.&#13;
2.40).&#13;
4.5          Dated covenants to be included in the Legal Agreements are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
(a)         Decentralization and Operational Efficiency:&#13;
(i)    that the transfer of STU-REC will be completed by the target date of December&#13;
31, 1996 or when 60 percent of the loan funds have been disbursed,&#13;
whichever date is earlier, in accordance with a phased program previously&#13;
agreed with the Bank (para. 3.9);&#13;
{ii)   that not later than June 30, 1996 PE establish or designate a juridically&#13;
independent public corporation (the PE Entity) with sufficient powers and&#13;
authority to accept the transfer of STU-REC and to own and operate all assets&#13;
included therein. That PE not later than December 1 5 each year after the&#13;
Transfer and until December 15. 2001, execute agreements with the PE Entity,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (the Contract Plans), including specific performance&#13;
targets for the following fiscal year and the financial contributions and other&#13;
actions required from the State to enable the PE Entity to attain such targets.&#13;
(para. 3.8);&#13;
(iii)   that CBTU will actively pursue actions to meet the agreed basic performance&#13;
targets until the transfer of STU-REC and cooperate with the PE Entity&#13;
thereafter to achieve the agreed targets until the end of the project by ensuring&#13;
that the implementation of the project is on schedule (para. 3.16).&#13;
(b)         Financial Policy and Modal Integration:&#13;
(i)    that prior to the transfer of STU-REC to the State, the GOB will be responsible&#13;
for the cost of capital investments plus debt service (interest and amortization)&#13;
of the STU-REC incurred before the transfer and the costs of the proposed&#13;
Loan (para. 2.21);&#13;
(ii)   that during the period up to December 31, 1996, the GOB: (a) will cover the&#13;
difference between the working costs and operating revenues of the STU-REC;&#13;
and (b) that after the transfer is effected, the GOB operating subsidy (shortfall&#13;
between operating revenues and working expenses) to the PE Entity will be&#13;
discontinued (para. 2.21);&#13;
(iii)   that the CBTU and PE undertake to ensure completion of the financing&#13;
mechanisms study (under terms of reference approved by the Bank) at least&#13;
one month before the Mid-term Project Review, so that an Action Plan on the&#13;
agreed recommendations can be prepared (para. 2.12); and&#13;
(iv)   that not later than 1 2 months from the date of signing of the Loan Agreement,&#13;
PE will present a plan (financial, technical and institutional) and a timetable,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, for the transfer, integration and consolidation of the&#13;
municipal and metropolitan bus system with the STU-REC (para. 2.12).&#13;
(c)        that a Mid-term Project Review will take place 24 months after effectiveness to review&#13;
pre-agreed institutional, operational and financial performance indicators, and&#13;
compliance with covenants (including tariffs, subsidies, and progress on studies) of the&#13;
Loan and Project Agreements, to assess project performance and progress on&#13;
decentralization, and as necessary, agree on remedial actions. Particular importance will&#13;
be given, during the Mid-term Review, to the agreed working ratios and the status of&#13;
the studies and action plans required to ensure a smooth transfer (para. 3.1 7); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(d)        Private Sector Participation: the State shall cause the PE Entity, starting no later than&#13;
one year after the STU-REC transfer is effective to issue at least four invitations to bid,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, for the exploitation of trains, station space, aerial space above&#13;
stations, parking terminals, automatic fare collection and other investments (para.&#13;
2.42).&#13;
4.6           Retroactive Financing of up to US$10 million equivalent (10 percent of loan funds) is&#13;
recommended because certain project activities for expenditures made after March 31, 1995, such as&#13;
preparation of final engineering designs, will have to be undertaken immediately. Claims for retroactive&#13;
financing would have to be made no later than three months after loan effectiveness.&#13;
4.7           Recommendation. With the above Agreements and Conditions, the proposed project&#13;
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$102 million equivalent, to be repaid in 15 years, at the Bank's&#13;
standard variable rate, with a grace period of five years and loan amortization based on level&#13;
repayments of principal.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RECIFE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
BANK ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN TRANSPORT SECTOR IN BRAZIL&#13;
AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.                  This Annex outlines the Bank's past support for the Brazilian urban transport&#13;
sector and the experience gained. The lessons learned can be summarized as: (a) the coordination&#13;
between the three levels of government in urban transport should be dealt with very carefully at the&#13;
project preparation level and reviewed in detail during the Mid-term Project Review; (b) policy for the&#13;
sector should be strengthened to minimize distortions resulting from inefficient physical and financial&#13;
coordination between modes and to promote multi-modal integration; (c) the tariff levels should allow&#13;
for significant cost recovery of working costs and should be complemented by financing mechanisms&#13;
which cover the shortfall; (d) demand levels are often overestimated and should therefore be carefully&#13;
scrutinized; and (e) more attention should be given to the management of infrastructure maintenance.&#13;
A. First Urban Transport Project (Ln. 1563-BR, US$88 million, May 1978)&#13;
2.                   Project Objectives. The objectives were to: (a) finance investments that would&#13;
improve urban transport services, with emphasis on the provision of public transport, especially to the&#13;
poor; (b) promote and support the development and implementation of appropriate urban transport&#13;
policies; and (c) strengthen municipal, state, and federal capacity to prepare, appraise, and execute&#13;
sound urban transport projects.&#13;
3.                   Project Content. The project was broad in scope and included traffic engineering&#13;
and management measures in central urban areas and at critical points, the introduction of exclusive&#13;
bus lanes and segregated busways, widening of critical links, or construction of missing links in the&#13;
road network, reorganization or construction of bus terminals, paving of bus routes in low-income&#13;
areas, and training, technical assistance and institutional strengthening to improve the delivery of&#13;
transport services. Project beneficiaries included five metropolitan regions (Belo Horizonte, Curitiba,&#13;
Porto Alegre, Recife and Salvador). Nine different agencies were involved in implementation and overall&#13;
coordination was the responsibility of Brazilian Urban Transport Company (EBTU).&#13;
4.                  Implementation Experience. The project experienced various delays due to: (a)&#13;
lack of institutional support to the cities from EBTU, and Government changes in 1 979 wnich led to&#13;
staff changes in the various implementing agencies; (b) the preparation of final engineering designs and&#13;
tendering; (c) land acquisition; (d) availability of counterpart funds; (e) local level coordination; and (f)&#13;
quality control of the works. The closing date for the project was extended twice, resulting in&#13;
implementation period changing from three years to five years and nine months. This suggests that the&#13;
appraisal schedule estimate was overly optimistic. Even so, the implementation period was still&#13;
substantially shorter than both worldwide and LAC region profiles which were above eight years. The&#13;
only specific covenant not met was the one requiring the five municipalities to take the necessary steps&#13;
to revise the valuation for tax purposes of properties whose values had been affected by the project.&#13;
In the early stages of the project, EBTU staff were less forceful than expected in solving local problems&#13;
and bringing difficulties to the attention of decision-makers. It must be recognized, however, that EBTU&#13;
was in its formative stages. This was a first project for them and there was a learning process&#13;
involved. As part of this process, and in order to achieve institutional improvement, EBTU prepared&#13;
several operational manuals to assist in the appraisal and supervision processes. These manuals and&#13;
the experience gained by EBTU (and the Bank) provided the basis for the development procedures&#13;
applied in the Third Urban Transport Project (1981), which did much to improve the quality and&#13;
efficiency of EBTU's operations.&#13;

5.                   Results. The project was timely and helped to focus the Government's growing&#13;
concern about urban transport problems. The support given to the institutional development of EBTU,&#13;
following its creation in 1 976, improved federal-level urban transport planning. The project was&#13;
successful in providing improved urban transport services, particularly public transport to serve the&#13;
poor. The OED concludes that "the project was successful in implementing some of the most&#13;
imaginative and radical bus priority measures carried out anywhere in the world. These experiences&#13;
have relevance for Bank-financed urban transport projects worldwide." The bus priority measures&#13;
included the development of the bus corridor concept. Bus corridors were designed to accommodate&#13;
passenger demand levels which were difficult to satisfy by conventional bus services. Schemes&#13;
involved segregated busways introduced into the existing road system, facilities for passengers and&#13;
pedestrians, bus system reorganization (usually trunk/feeder), traffic management measures and&#13;
integrated bus fare systems. The project was also generally successful in providing institutional support&#13;
at the metropolitan region (MR) level where there has been a significant improvement in the capacity&#13;
of the agencies to tackle urban transport issues. The success was most particularly noted in those&#13;
cities in which plans for future urban transport investments existed, not necessarily financed by the&#13;
Bank, which provided the scope for continued institutional support. Finally, the studies and institutional&#13;
strengthening financed under the project, coupled with the successful implementation of the physical&#13;
components, have led to policy changes affecting urban transport in Brazil as whole and, in particular,&#13;
have resulted in increased emphasis on public bus transport and greater attention to cost-effective&#13;
policies of traffic management.&#13;
6.                   Sustainability. Institutional, technical and financial resources are required to&#13;
sustain the types of investments included in the First Urban Transport Project. Although there were&#13;
some institutional and technical weaknesses, the project clearly provided support to strengthen EBTU&#13;
and the local agencies. In the case of EBTU, this support was continued in the Third Urban Transport&#13;
Project. The major constraint with respect to sustainability has been the lack of provision for cost&#13;
recovery, or other funds to cover maintenance of the physical schemes implemented under the project.&#13;
The failure to make provision for maintenance of the investments is seen in practically all the city&#13;
projects.&#13;
7.                   However, the project had a substantial institutional impact overall. It assisted&#13;
EBTU at a critical and formative stage of its development, by providing strong technical and financial&#13;
support, which enabled it to play a catalytic role in transport improvements in urban areas. EBTU&#13;
subsequently took increasing responsibility in the appraisal and supervision of Bank-financed urban&#13;
transport projects, a process which began with the five metropolitan regions included in the First Urban&#13;
Transport Project, and which culminated with full responsibility for appraisal and supervision of eleven&#13;
of the fourteen urban centers included in the Third Urban Transport Project.&#13;
8.                   The institutional support resulting from the technical assistance and studies,&#13;
coupled with the experience gained generally from the successful implementation of the physical&#13;
components included in the First Urban Transport Project, have led to urban transport policy changes&#13;
which affect Brazil as a whole. These include more emphasis on traffic management, on the provision&#13;
of public bus transport, and on the functioning of coordinating bodies at the local level to implement&#13;
urban transport policy.&#13;
B. Second Urban Transport (Porto Alegre) Project (Ln. 1839-BR, US$159 million, June 1980)&#13;
9.                   Project Objectives. The objectives were: (a) to establish a new company to own,&#13;
manage, and operate a suburban rail mass transit system on a commercial basis without operating&#13;
subsidies; (b) to achieve a significantly more efficient modal distribution of traffic and use of all&#13;
transport facilities in the metropolitan region's North-South corridor; and (c) to promote the&#13;
&#13;

development of selected employment growth poles in the North-South corridor near urban railway&#13;
stations.&#13;
10.                 Project Content. The project consisted of the construction of a surface suburban&#13;
rail mass transit system using electric unit trains between the central business area in Porto Alegre and&#13;
the municipality of Sapucaia, 26.7 km to the north, the establishment of a new company to own,&#13;
manage and operate this service, and a complementary program of policies and studies.&#13;
11.                Implementation Experience. Despite some serious problems of procurement,&#13;
passenger services started in March 1985, one year after the originally planned starting date. The&#13;
railway company, TRENSURB, was successfully established and during the course of project&#13;
implementation changed its nature from a construction organization to a railway operating company.&#13;
The Project Closing Date was extended once by one year to December 31, 1986.&#13;
12.                 Results. The Project Completion Report sums up well the principal lessons:&#13;
(a)   It is not sufficient that the railway service has been successfully implemented.&#13;
The success of the project depends upon the service attracting sufficient&#13;
passengers to make the investments economically viable and the railway profit-&#13;
able. This will be highly contingent upon the resumption of economic growth&#13;
in Porto Alegre and in the evolution of the fares for the users of alternative&#13;
transport modes. In addition, the attractiveness of the system would be&#13;
enhanced by the implementation of the recommendations of the studies carried&#13;
out under the project (bus integration, car parking restrictions, etc.).&#13;
(b)    One major lesson to be learned from this project is that, in cases in which there&#13;
is a need for substantial policy decisions and the implementation of measures&#13;
involving different Government agencies subject to conflicting pressures, their&#13;
commitment should be realistically assessed during project preparation. The&#13;
steps to ensure that these policies are implemented on time should be carefully&#13;
identified at the same time. In the particular case of the Second Urban&#13;
Transport Project, a more detailed action program including specific policv&#13;
implementation targets and appropriate measures for its enforcement should&#13;
have been agreed upon during appraisal.&#13;
(c)    Regarding the original objective of TRENSURB covering its working costs, the&#13;
appraisal was unrealistic to expect that this would take place during the initial&#13;
operation period. Only after the system has demonstrated its reliability to the&#13;
users, will the application of a revenue maximizing policy be feasible. In the&#13;
meantime, TRENSURB should review its staff needs in order to streamline costs&#13;
and carry out a tariff study to determine the optimal user charges. The Bank&#13;
should closely follow-up the implementation of these tasks in the context of its&#13;
ongoing and future involvement in the sector and continue to impress upon the&#13;
Government the benefits to be gained from a financially healthy public enter-&#13;
prise as well as the existence of tools much more effective than transport&#13;
subsidies to achieve income distribution objectives.&#13;

C. Third Urban Transport Project (Ln. 1965-BR. US$90 million, March 1981)&#13;
13.                 Project Objectives. The objectives were: (a) to improve the quality and&#13;
efficiency of EBTU's operations through changes in its structure, procedures, and staff allocation; (b)&#13;
to improve transport infrastructure and operations in 14 medium-sized cities and conurbations&#13;
(AGLURB); and (c) to pave bus routes in low-income areas in medium-sized cities, state capitals, and&#13;
metropolitan regions {termed PROPAV).&#13;
14.                 Project Content. The project consisted of three subprojects: (a) the institutional&#13;
subproject included EBTU's reorganization, training, technical assistance and studies; (b) the AGLURB&#13;
subproject consisted of the establishment and operation of an urban transport management unit in each&#13;
of the 14 cities and various components in low-cost improvements to existing urban transport&#13;
infrastructure, with emphasis on public transport operations and improvements of planning and&#13;
operation of urban transport infrastructure and services at the local level; and (c) the PROPAV&#13;
subproject included the paving of about 850 km of bus routes in low-income areas.&#13;
15.                Implementation Experience. Project implementation delays were experienced&#13;
as a result of numerous political changes, limited counterpart funds, the transfer of EBTU to the&#13;
Ministrio de Desenvolvimento Urbano (MDU) from the Ministerio dos Transportes (MT) and, soon&#13;
thereafter, the Federal Government's Economic Package, which delayed the signing of the 1986&#13;
Convenios by about six months. The project was amended twice, which included the addition of four&#13;
cities to the AGLURB subproject and of 350 km of bus routes in low-income areas to the PROPAV&#13;
subproject, and resulted also in an extension in the implementation period from four years and three&#13;
months to five years and nine months. EBTU was in compliance with all loan covenants.&#13;
16.                 Results. The AGLURB subproject has done much to create a realistic and&#13;
effective transport planning environment in Brazilian medium-sized conurbations. The design of the&#13;
physical components drew heavily on the successful experience of the First Urban Transport Project.&#13;
Emphasis of the project was placed on cost-effective, traffic management-based schemes in which&#13;
assistance to public transport (buses) has been the primary objective in the majority of components.&#13;
The institutional development of the AGLURB areas was achieved through the establishment of&#13;
management units specifically to coordinate project implementation. Transport companies were formed&#13;
to coordinate transport planning and operation. Retention of the management units would depend on&#13;
decisions by individual cities, but selected personnel would be transferred from the management units&#13;
to the transport companies. At the time of project completion, the implementation delays arising from&#13;
the political, financial, and organizational factors meant that comprehensive ex-post evaluations were&#13;
not yet available. As with the First Urban Transport Project, there is a risk that the institutional gains&#13;
may not be sustained unless a flow of funds is made available to AGLURB cities to continue purposeful&#13;
transport planning.&#13;
1 7.                The PROPAV program was innovative and was a significant step in EBTU's&#13;
development. PROPAV was essentially a subsectoral component and EBTU was responsible for all&#13;
aspects of the program. The program utilized local materials and labor-intensive construction methods&#13;
to the maximum practical extent, with the result that the costs were initially overestimated. This&#13;
permitted a greater than targeted program to be undertaken, and to date all 850 km of paving have&#13;
been implemented. The PROPAV program is regarded as a highly successful program. To an extent,&#13;
the success of the program is demonstrated by the fact that similar paving programs have been&#13;
undertaken in other countries in Latin America.&#13;
1 8.               The institutional strengthening comprised two main aspects: (a) EBTU&#13;
reorganization; and (b) training and studies. The reorganization of EBTU proposed under the Third&#13;
Project was completed in 1 984. In general, the reorganization was judged to have increased EBTU's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -                                 ANNEX 1&#13;
effectiveness. However, with the changing demands arising from federal government policy on&#13;
decentralization and from the needs of the Fourth Urban Transport Project, additional changes were&#13;
considered necessary.&#13;
1 9.                The training program comprised a conventional approach (of courses, seminars,&#13;
etc.) to transport planners and an imaginative training program for bus operators and personnel. The&#13;
latter program has been successful in lowering bus operating costs, reducing accidents, and improving&#13;
public acceptability for bus services.&#13;
20.                 The general delays in project implementation affected the commencement of&#13;
the studies proposed for inclusion in the project. Furthermore, EBTU did not initially give high priority&#13;
to the studies. However, in the last year of the project, the study program was revised and additionally&#13;
provided inputs to the preparation of the Fourth Urban Transport project. In particular, the Financial&#13;
Study enabled EBTU to form a policy for on-lending, the vehicle operating cost study (carried out by&#13;
GEIPOT) provided data for incorporation in the EBTU Operations Manual (OM), and the bus information&#13;
system program (SITURB) furnished an initial data base for evaluating bus operating costs.&#13;
D. Fourth Urban Transport Project (Ln. 2822-BR, US$200 million, May 1987)&#13;
21.                 Project Objectives. The objectives were: (a) improve the operating efficiency&#13;
of the urban transport systems in the nine metropolitan regions (MRs) through savings in transport&#13;
costs and time; (b) seek to pass savings from improvements in the urban transport systems on to&#13;
users, many of whom were among the urban poor, in the form of lower tariffs and/or improved levels&#13;
of service; (c) conserve energy and encourage substitution of diesel fuel by promotion of domestic&#13;
energy sources, wherever economically justified; (d) strengthen the role of financial aspects in urban&#13;
transport policy; (e) strengthen the major institutions, in particular for coordinated investment planning&#13;
for the sector as a whole; and (f) increase the responsiveness of transport planning to local needs.&#13;
22.                 Project Content. The proposed project would have financed components&#13;
selected from EBTU's rolling urban transport investment plan (1986-1 990) in Brazil's nine MRs (Belo&#13;
Horizonte, Belem, Curitiba, Fortaleza, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and S3o Paulo).&#13;
Components would include a Corridor Program, comprising investments, including design and&#13;
supervision, to improve public transportation (mainly bus systems, but also some trolley bus and ferry&#13;
systems) and to correct weaknesses in road networks. The Corridor Program would include&#13;
infrastructure (including extensive rehabilitation and reconstruction), traffic management measures and&#13;
supporting organizational improvements; and a system-wide Maintenance Program, including civil&#13;
works, equipment, the establishment of maintenance management systems, and institutional&#13;
strengthening. The project would also finance a sector-wide Institutional Program which would involve&#13;
EBTU, MRs, MDU, and CBTU. This component would include technical assistance and training for&#13;
improved planning and operational practices, studies and organizational measures to strengthen and&#13;
improve sector coordination, financial planning and urban transport policy development and pilot&#13;
technological development programs.&#13;
23.                 Results. There was a considerable delay in declaring the project effective.&#13;
Institutional problems at the level of the Federal Government resulted in a very poor environment for&#13;
the project's implementation. The Fourth Urban Transport Project was canceled when the EBTU was&#13;
abolished by the Government in 1 989.&#13;

1 993, and its Closing Date is June 30, 1 996. The project is underway and several major institutional&#13;
hurdles, such as a federal law to transfer the assets of all the CBTU subdivisions from the Federal to&#13;
the State Governments, have been overcome. The rehabilitation of CBTU-SP, the Sao Paulo subdivision&#13;
of the CBTU, is underway. Sao Paulo established a new company (CPTM) to take over the&#13;
decentralized CBTU-SP and also the FEPASA metropolitan train. So far, the main problems of the&#13;
project have been associated with problems at the Federal level, including delays in the opening of the&#13;
special account, and several changes in ministers and their immediate advisors. These constant&#13;
changes delayed the signing of conv6nios which regulate the transfer of operations and assets. The&#13;
actual takeover of CBTU by CPTM took place on May 27, 1994. The project is now disbursing very&#13;
well and some of the infrastructure and equipment components have been completed. As of February&#13;
21, 1995, 68 percent of the total project cost had been committed.&#13;

and its Closing Date is December 31, 1997. Most of the bids for track work and rolling stock&#13;
rehabilitation are underway. The actual decentralization which involved the takeover of CBTU-Rio de&#13;
Janeiro by the State of Rio de Janeiro, and took place on January 1, 1995. As of February 21, 1995,&#13;
40 percent of the total project cost had been committed.&#13;
G. Conclusions and Lessons Learned&#13;
26.                 Despite the considerable achievements of the First Urban Transport Project and&#13;
the success of the Third Urban Transport Project, the projects have led to the conclusion that several&#13;
specific issues in the urban transport sector require attention and should be addressed within the&#13;
context of overall sector reform. The main issues are discussed below.&#13;
27.                 Cost Recovery. Direct cost recovery is difficult in the urban transport sector,&#13;
other than for self-financing infrastructure and passenger vehicles and vessels. Therefore,&#13;
transportation infrastructure investments (urban and interurban) conventionally recover costs indirectly&#13;
through transport-related taxes. In the First Urban Transport Project, it was envisaged that partial cost&#13;
recovery would take place by the revaluation of properties whose values were affected by the project.&#13;
No such revision in valuation, however, has apparently taken place in any of the five MRs, partly&#13;
because of the difficulties in assessing an increase in property values through the low-cost&#13;
improvement schemes provided under the project, when alternative policies or conditions encourage&#13;
the provision of essential municipal infrastructure, at little or no cost to the beneficiaries. In retrospect,&#13;
the project should have also addressed the indirect cost recovery mechanisms.&#13;
28.                 Maintenance. Lack of maintenance is clearly a problem in each of the five MRs&#13;
in the First Project, and is now apparent in the components implemented early in the Third Urban&#13;
Transport Project. Problems apply to a wide range of components. Maintenance covenants were&#13;
included in the agreements for both projects, but this has proved an ineffective mechanism for ensuring&#13;
adequate maintenance levels. While there is increasing awareness of the problem and while improved&#13;
maintenance standards are an objective of the Federal Government. there is a need to develop an&#13;
institutional and financial framework and capability to provide the necessary funding and to carry out&#13;
the appropriate maintenance. In hindsight, this problem probably reflects the limitation of addressing&#13;
narrow sectoral issues, in isolation of a broader policy framework for the urban sector as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -                                 ANNEX 1&#13;
29.                  Bus Regulation. There has been a trend in some cities toward the creation of&#13;
integrated bus systems, controlled and regulated by a central, public authority. The central authority&#13;
plans the system and contracts with operators to provide services according to standard cost&#13;
schedules. "Excess revenue" is taken from operators on profitable routes to cross subsidize those&#13;
operating unprofitable routes. The feeder/trunk concept may make this increased regulation easier to&#13;
achieve. There are several areas of concern. First, there are signs that the determination by the central&#13;
authority of all operating parameters is tending to lead to standardized solutions which may stifle&#13;
innovation and reduce passenger choice. Second, the contribution of the private sector is limited. Third,&#13;
the needs of the passenger do not always receive adequate attention; for example, feeder/trunk&#13;
systems force passengers to change buses and in cases where full integration has not been achieved,&#13;
passengers can be worse off since they have to pay twice and are further inconvenienced by the&#13;
change. A thorough review of the regulatory framework is urgently required, to ensure improved&#13;
accessibility, greater equity and efficiency, and a stronger role for private sector operators of public&#13;
transport.&#13;
H. Lessons Learned and the Proposed Recife Metropolitan Decentralization Transport Project&#13;
30.                  The proposed urban transport project is the seventh to be considered in Brazil.&#13;
Thus, there is considerable "in-country" experience to draw upon. In addition, the design of the&#13;
proposed project has attempted to recognize the findings and experience from similar projects outlined&#13;
in this Annex. The main features of the proposed project which respond to the lessons learned are&#13;
described in the following paragraphs.&#13;
31.                  Institutions. A successful institutional arrangement will be the key to project&#13;
success and project sustainability. In the past in Brazil, there has been little incentive for&#13;
cities/municipalities to undertake cost-effective transport planning and investment. Cities have been&#13;
starved of resources for transport investment. The expansion of the Recife Regional Transport&#13;
Coordination Commission (RTCC) will be a major advance. In addition to insuring that major projects&#13;
are in line with an approved integrated air quality, land use and urban transport strategy, RTCC's key&#13;
role will be to facilitate service and tariff integration between the several modes. It is expected that&#13;
no urban transport project in Recife will be considered in the future by the Bank without prior approval&#13;
by the RTCC.&#13;
32.                  To further support the long-term development of traffic and transport planning,&#13;
the project will include funding for the preparation of an Integrated Air Quality, Land Use and Urban&#13;
Transport strategy and the updating of the metropolitan data base. Staff from participating&#13;
implementing agencies will benefit from this work.&#13;
33.                  Counterpart Funding. In Brazil, lack of timely counterpart funding is often the&#13;
main cause of delays in project implementation. Several steps were taken to mitigate this problem. As&#13;
a condition of negotiations, GOB indicated in writing that counterpart funds for the proposed project&#13;
will be available. Although an analysis of the State finances reveals that the sources of funds exist,&#13;
the challenge will be to ensure that they are available when the system is decentralized to cover in a&#13;
timely fashion the operating deficit of the system.&#13;
34.                  Implementation Schedule. Long implementation, and thus slow disbursements,&#13;
have been problems in previous projects. This may be traced to:&#13;
(a)    Lack of familiarity of local staff with Bank procedures. A training program is&#13;
proposed but training programs take time for benefits to be realized and, even&#13;
then, there is no substitute for practical application. CBTU's PIU has gained&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-                                  ANNEX 1&#13;
considerable experience with the ongoing S3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro&#13;
Metropolitan Transport Decentralization loans (Lns.3457-BR and 3633-BR).&#13;
(b)    Uncertain political commitment. The expansion of the RTCC's responsibilities&#13;
gives grounds for confidence that all levels of government of the metropolitan&#13;
region are committed to the project. During preparation the level of support&#13;
was excellent.&#13;
(c)    Lack of final engineering designs for physical works. It is proposed that&#13;
participating agencies should have the first year of final engineering designs&#13;
(including bidding documents) available at negotiations.&#13;
35.                 Environment. In the past, urban transport projects with the exception of the&#13;
Mexico Transport Air Quality Management Project (Ln. 3543-ME) and the Teheran Transport Emissions&#13;
Reduction Project (TF 028642-GET) have had few or no specific measures to improve air quality&#13;
project. The proposed project contains an Air Quality and Traffic Safety component which together&#13;
with the infrastructure components is expected to set the foundations for further development in those&#13;
areas in the Recife Metropolitan Region.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RECIFE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
REGIONAL TRANSPORT COORDINATION COMMISSION&#13;
A. Institutional Responsibilities for Urban Transport in the RMR&#13;
1.           The Recife Metropolitan Region (RMR) has 13 municipalities: Recife, Cabo, Moreno,&#13;
Jaboatao, Paulista, Sao Lorenco, Olinda, Igarassue, Abreu e Lima, Itamaraca, Camaragibe e Ipojuca.&#13;
Al. Development Council for the Recife Metropolitan Region (CONDERM)&#13;
2.           In the 1 994 the State of Pernambuco established the Development Council for the&#13;
Recife Metropolitan Region (Conselho de Desenvolvimento de Regiao Metropolitana do Recife,&#13;

interest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -                                ANNEX 3&#13;
A2. Metropolitan Transport Chamber&#13;
3.           CONDERM  established in 1994 the Metropolitan Chamber of Transport (Camara&#13;
Municipal de Transportes) and defined its functions which apply except for those which are the&#13;
responsibility of the State Council of Transport (Conselho Estadual de Transportes, CET) and the&#13;
Metropolitan Council for Urban Transport (Conselho Metropolitano de Transportes Urbanos, CMTU).&#13;
Among the functions of the Camara Metropolitana de Transportes are to:&#13;
(a)    give its views on the proposals for planning and operational guidelines for the&#13;
metropolitan transport infrastructure system and its integration with the&#13;
municipal/local networks.&#13;
(b)    cooperate from  the technical standpoint in the planning and setting of&#13;
operational guidelines for the several modes of transport; and&#13;
(c)    suggest the establishment of operational parameters for the freight transport&#13;
system, especially in its terminals.&#13;
4.           The CMTU was established in October of 1985 with the following functions:&#13;
(a)    evaluate and set the policies and guidelines applicable to the RMR insofar as&#13;
tariffs are concerned;&#13;
(b)   introduce guidelines and general norms for the Deliberative Council of the RMR&#13;
insofar as the STPP is concerned;&#13;
(c)    propose policies and general guidelines for the EMTU\Recife insofar as&#13;
transport is concerned in the RMR;&#13;
(d)    give an opinion on the work progress and to monitor the performance of&#13;
EMTU\Recife; and&#13;
(e)    promote the integration of activities and services undertaken by the bodies and&#13;
entities which are part of the Chamber, as well as the interface with other&#13;
components of the levels of government, directly or indirectly related to the&#13;
transport system.&#13;
5.           CMTU is composed of:&#13;
&#149; The Secretary of State for Transport (President)&#13;
v The Secretary of Planning of the State (Vice-President)&#13;
* The President of EMTU\Recife.&#13;
* The Mayors of the RMR (3)&#13;
v The Superintendent of the Legislative Assembly&#13;
* The Representative of the MREC&#13;
* Representatives of the other municipalities (2 on a rotating basis)&#13;
* The Superintendent of the CBTU&#13;
* The President of CTU&#13;
&#149; The President of the Union of Bus Transport Companies (SETRANS)&#13;
&#149; The President of the Union of Bus Operating Personnel&#13;
4 Representatives of the Communities (3)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -                                 ANNEX 3&#13;
* The President of the Commercial Association or of the Federation of Industries of&#13;
Pernambuco (on rotating basis).&#13;
A3. Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos (EMTU)&#13;
6.            It is the responsibility of EMTU\Recife to:&#13;
(a)    exercise the powers which were attributed to the State to discipline, delegate&#13;
and supervise the operation of services which integrate the system;&#13;
(b)    control the performance of the several modes in the system;&#13;
(c)    define in detail the networks for the modes which are part of STPP\Recife;&#13;
(d)    administer and coordinate terminals and yards, public and private, which are&#13;
part of the system;&#13;
(e)    promote the technical and operational upgrading of the staff and operation&#13;
companies of the STPP;&#13;
(f)    propose and execute the tariff policy for all the modes which are part of the&#13;
system;&#13;
(g)    give its opinion about the economical, technical and financial feasibility and&#13;
priority of the projects dealing with services to the public and the transport&#13;
infrastructure system;&#13;
(h)    apply the penalties established for non compliance with the services contracted&#13;
with the companies operating the STPP; and&#13;
(i)    execute the services related to its functions which were delegated to the state&#13;
by the Federal and Municipal governments.&#13;
7.            Basically EMTU\Recife serves as the planning secretariat for CMTU which is actually&#13;
a type of RTCC. What the proposed project would like to achieve is the inclusion of the Recife branch&#13;
of CBTU in the EMTU rather than just its participation as an observer.&#13;
B. Present Financing Mechanisms for Urban Transport in the RMR&#13;
8.           The RMR has basically four modes in operation:&#13;
(a)    diesel buses;&#13;
(b)    electric buses (trolleybus);&#13;
(c)    electric train (CBTU-METROREC); and&#13;
(d)    diesel train (CBTU-South line).&#13;
9.           The diesel buses serve basically all the RMR and the trolleybuses are concentrated in&#13;
Caxanga Av. with expansion forseen to highway PE-1 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -                               ANNEX 3&#13;
10.          The STPP\RMR carries 34.5 million passengers per month of which 89 percent are by&#13;
diesel bus, 3 percent by trolleybus, 7 percent by Metro and 1 percent by diesel train. The financial&#13;
administration of the diesel bus system is made through a clearing house (Ca^mara de Compensacao&#13;
Tarifaria, CCT) managed by EMTU\Recife. The trolleybuses have a separate accounting. The&#13;
METROREC and the diesel train are also administered separately by CBTU, they are not included in the&#13;
CCT.&#13;
11.         In the case of diesel buses the overall revenues are roughly US$9.5 million\month. The&#13;
main sources of financing are:&#13;
(a)   the integral tariff paid in cash by the user;&#13;
(b)   the revenue received with the sale of the vale-transporte; and&#13;
(c)   the revenue obtained with the student pass at 50 percent of the integral tariff.&#13;
12.          There are non-operational revenues which come from:&#13;
(a)   revenues due to the financial application of money obtained with the sale of&#13;
the vale-transporte and the Student Pass; and&#13;
(b)   revenues from tickets which are bought and are not utilized.&#13;
13.          The non-operational revenues are now 7 percent of operational revenues, but depends&#13;
on the interest rate. The revenues with the diesel bus system cover 95 percent of the total cost of the&#13;
system. The trolleybus system does not have a strict cost spreadsheet as the diesel system has, and&#13;
they are operated by the public operator CTU. EMTU believes that the trolleybus operation covers its&#13;
operating cost (without depreciation). The METROREC and the diesel train operated by CBTU cover&#13;
only 1 5 percent of their operating cost (without depreciation). The CBTU tariff is equal to the lowest&#13;
bus tariff. The deficit is roughly US$2.4 million\month and is paid by the Federal Government.&#13;
14.          The main challenge for the STPP\RMR and EMTU will be to integrate in its CCT the train&#13;
system once it is complete, and find additional extra-operational sources of revenues to help offset the&#13;
deficit. The depreciation and cost of capital should be part of multi-year programs included in the&#13;
budget which should be funded either by general tax revenues or earmarked revenues.&#13;
C. Transformation of EMTU into a Regional Transport Coordination Commission (RTCC)&#13;
1 5.         To facilitate coordination of investment and operation among the major providers of&#13;
urban transport services, the proposal to create a regional coordinating body is being given priority.&#13;
This would not be a new level of government and would not usurp the powers of the State or the&#13;
Municipality. It would provide a forum, however, to formally review all proposals with respect to their&#13;
compliance with an agreed-upon transport strategy, evaluate alternatives, and make recommendations&#13;
based on a regional, intermodal point of view. The RTCC would include representatives of the Governor&#13;
of the State and Mayors of the RMR, in particular the Mayor of the Recife Municipality, as well as STU-&#13;
REC, DER-PE, DETRAN and bus operators association and those agencies responsible for municipal and&#13;
regional planning. An Executive Secretariat in charge of actually developing and/or evaluating proposals&#13;
and carrying out day-to-day activities would be established. RTCC would be responsible for developing&#13;
an integrated urban transport, and air quality strategy for the RMR compatible with the land use&#13;
policies jointly developed with the land use agencies of the RMR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -                                  ANNEX 3&#13;
16.          The following questions must be asked when defining the functions of the RTCC: (a)&#13;
How are transport plans prepared, and how often are they updated? Is a single entity responsible for&#13;
their preparation across all modes (highways, metro, suburban rail, bus/busways) and the entire region,&#13;
or are separate plans prepared by the respective municipalities, building and operating companies and&#13;
then put together by a coordinating agency? (b) Who monitors the condition and performance of the&#13;
transport systems, and how do the results of the monitoring feed into the planning process? (c) What&#13;
is the relationship between the transport plan(s) and the respective land use plans developed by the&#13;
municipalities? (d) What is the relationship between the plan(s) developed under question (a) above,&#13;
and the multi-year capital program developed by the various implementing authorities? Is the project&#13;
flow top-down (i.e., emanates from the plan), bottom-up (generated by the implementers/operators),&#13;
or both? and (e) Do the various operating companies have direct access to funding or should their&#13;
capital budgets be approved either by the PE or the new RTCC?&#13;
17.          It was agreed that EMTU will ensure that bus routes will be re-routed to the stations&#13;
of the system and that such re-routing will occur as each link of the South line and the TIP-Timbi&#13;
becomes available for operation. It was also agreed that EMTU will curb the use of clandestine bus&#13;
operations especially if they serve routes parallel to the rail lines. Finally, it was agreed that the State&#13;
should not later than 12 months after signing, submit evidence to the Bank that STU-REC or its&#13;
successor will be included as part of EMTU and that financing mechanisms are in place to ensure&#13;
coverage of the PE Entity's operating subsidy if any.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RECIFE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1I.          In an effort to increase private sector participation in the project, CBTU has met with&#13;
the Chamber of Commerce, associations of civil works contractors, equipment manufacturers and real&#13;
estate specialists. The latter indicated that they are interested in exploring mechanisms for developing&#13;
real estate in and around the stations and have initiated a series of meetings with CBTU and STU-REC&#13;
personnel to examine the most suitable sites. In general, the associations indicated that there is a need&#13;
for some changes in municipal legislation to capitalize on the additional floor space created by new&#13;
buildings in the aerial space of the right-of-way and surrounding areas.&#13;
2.           Although there are at least two projects for the development of shopping areas and for&#13;
apartment buildings, the participants indicated that they are reluctant to commit themselves until they&#13;
see some progress in the works of the South line. The general consensus was also that in view of the&#13;
very high cost of credit to buy houses, it is unlikely that there would be a substantial number of&#13;
buyers. Participants asked the pre-appraisal mission whether the Bank could help with housing credits&#13;
as it was done in previous urban development loans. The representatives of the associations indicated&#13;
that they are interested in exploring mechanisms to develop real estate in and around the stations and&#13;
asked STU-REC personnel to provide them with more detailed data on the most interesting sites. They&#13;
also indicated that in the past the long delays in the completion of STU-REC works made any&#13;
substantial investments in real estate in the surrounding areas very risky. Bank financing of the&#13;
proposed project changes the picture and will create incentives for private sector participation but they&#13;
want to wait until the project is in progress.&#13;
B. Recommendations&#13;
3.           To examine the financial instruments which can encourage private participation in the&#13;
construction and operation of selected parts of the mass transit systems, CBTU has created a high-&#13;
level working group of entrepreneurs and financiers. Many aspects of this program appear to be&#13;
appropriate for private or joint public/private development, which could result in considerable savings.&#13;
Station development is the most obvious, but consideration should also be given to leasing of some&#13;
existing stations and transfer points for private sector development and operation. Disposition of&#13;
excess railway land and air rights would also be explored. CBTU has invited a high-level group,&#13;
including respected outsiders such as elected officials, investment bankers, prominent developers, civil&#13;
works contractors, and Chamber of Commerce representatives, to explore this as well as other ways&#13;
to "capture" some of the added value of railway real estate development and prepare proposals for&#13;
inclusion in the program.&#13;
4.           Since the project involves a decentralization and therefore a change of asset ownership,&#13;
it was agreed that any concessions to the private sector should be made preferably after the transfer&#13;
of ownership. On the basis of the above, it was agreed between CBTU and the Bank that to foster the&#13;
participation of the private sector in the system, the State/Municipality shareholder's agreement will&#13;
contain a clause which will require that the State cause the PE Entity to issue at least four invitations&#13;
to bid for private sector exploitation of trains, station space, aerial space, parking areas, automatic&#13;
ticket collection and other areas within a year of the transfer.&#13;
&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RECIFE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
1.           General. The CBTU Recife sub-division system (STU-REC) has a network of 52.5 km&#13;
of trackage (map IBRD 26915) organized in two corridors which converge near the Recife downtown&#13;
area: (a) the Central line inaugurated in 1 985, is electrified, with 20.5 km of double, broad gauge (1.60&#13;
m) track dedicated exclusively to passenger services; it consists of a 10 km line from Recife to&#13;
Coqueiral which continues with 6.5 km to Jaboatao. From Coqueiral it diverts 4.0 km to TIP (Integrated&#13;
Passenger Terminal), the main bus terminal for intercity traffic; and (b) the 32-km South line is used&#13;
for both the operations of RFFSA's freight services and STU-REC's diesel services for passengers. It&#13;
is composed of 21 km of double, one meter gauge track, which starts at the Recife downtown station&#13;
and goes to Pontezinha, then continues with 11 km of single track to Cabo. The overall project has&#13;
been designed to foster intermodal integration of both lines with the bus network and to provide for&#13;
separation of passenger services from RFFSA's freight traffic. It consists of the extension of the STU-&#13;
REC electrified system from TIP to Timbi and from Recife to Cajueiro Seco in the Central and South&#13;
line respectively. In addition, it includes the relocation of the existing 1.00 m gauge track from&#13;
Afogados to Cajueiro Seco, for exclusive dedication of RFFSA's freight traffic, and the duplication of&#13;
the track from Pontezinha to Cabo. A brief description of the investments included in the project is&#13;
presented in the next paragraphs.&#13;
2.           Civil Works. A summary of the main works is shown in Table 5.1 and described below:&#13;
(a)    Urban Bus Terminals. This program is designed to improve the intermodal&#13;
integration of the STU-REC system with urban buses serving the metropolitan&#13;
region, and entails the construction of three terminals in the Central line and&#13;
seven in the South line. The terminals will facilitate and speed up the transfer&#13;
of passengers between bus and rail modes thus minimizing overall passenger&#13;
trip times. They consist of bus roadways, parking and passenger queuing areas&#13;
and are an integral part of the rail stations. This component, including&#13;
contingencies, has been estimated to cost about US$6.6 million or about 3&#13;
percent of the total cost of the project.&#13;
(b)    Road Accesses. This project component aims at improving the road access to&#13;
selected stations in both lines, as well as redirecting road traffic in the area of&#13;
influence to the stations. The proposed works amount to about US$3.6&#13;
(including contingencies) or about 2 percent of the total cost of the project.&#13;
(c)    Passenger Stations. The existing 1 7 passenger stations in the Central line were&#13;
built during the period 1983-1 985, and are functional, of modern design, well&#13;
maintained, and can cope with the existing and projected passenger demand.&#13;
There are ten stations in service on the South line. The passenger stations&#13;
program calls for the construction of the Timbi station in the Central line and&#13;
ten new stations and modernization/enlargement of two existing stations&#13;
(Recife and Joana Bezerra) on the section Recife-Cajueiro Seco. In addition, five&#13;
stations on the section Cajueiro Seco-Cabo would be subject to minor&#13;
rehabilitation. This component envisages expenditures of about US$32.3&#13;
million (including contingencies) or 1 6 percent of total project cost.&#13;
(d)    Bridges, Road Viaducts and Pedestrian Over/underpasses. The entire right-of-&#13;
way of the STU-REC system in the Central line is fenced and is not subject to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -                                 ANNEX 5&#13;
road traffic interferences. In contrast, the diesel service provided in the South&#13;
line has several at-grade crossings and the toll on pedestrian safety and train&#13;
reliability is high. This program is designed to eliminate these problems by&#13;
constructing 1 6 bridges, 4 road viaducts, and 1 0 pedestrian over/underpasses.&#13;
The cost of these works has been estimated at about US$17.1 million&#13;
(including contingencies) or 8 percent of total project cost.&#13;
(e)    Workshops. The STU-REC network is served by strategically located workshops&#13;
and depots to provide overall maintenance and heavy overhaul facilities. They&#13;
are located at Cavaleiro (for the electric multiple units (EMUs) fleet) in the&#13;
Central line, Werneck (for diesel locomotives) and Cinco Pontas (for passenger&#13;
coaches). From site visits to these facilities, it can be noted that some re-&#13;
equipping and a expansion of Cavaleiro workshop is needed to cope with the&#13;
maintenance requirements of the 25 units that would be operating once the&#13;
project is completed. Facilities for the maintenance of the systems (catenary,&#13;
sub-stations, automatic ticketing equipment, signaling and telecommunications,&#13;
laboratory electronics, etc.) and permanent way equipment, wash track, wheel&#13;
turning facilities, storage for spare parts, and an administration building are&#13;
located at Cavaleiro workshop. The workshop program includes: (i) the&#13;
construction of an additional area in the Cavaleiro workshop for the major&#13;
overhaul and future maintenance of EMUs; (ii) construction of a maintenance&#13;
shed for the diesel locomotives at Cajueiro Seco. The proposed works amount&#13;
to US$1 .0 million (including contingencies) or 0.5 percent of total project cost.&#13;
3.            Permanent Way. The double, broad gauge (1.60 m) track in the Central line has its&#13;
right-of-way fenced and is laid with 57 kg/m welded rails. Sleepers are monoblock of prestressed&#13;
concrete with elastic rail fastenings laid on crushed stone ballast. The track is in good condition and&#13;
permits speeds up to 90 km/h. The track in the South line is laid with 45 kg/rails, bi-block concrete&#13;
sleepers with elastic rail fastenings and crushed stone ballast. The track is in poor to fair condition. The&#13;
Permanent Way program included in the project entails:&#13;
(a)    Central line. The construction of a 4.5 km electrified, double, broad gauge (1.60 m)&#13;
track extension of the Central line, from TIP terminal station to Timbi. A double track&#13;
with maximum grades of 2 percent and minimum radius of 300 m, would be built with&#13;
the same standards as the existing main line and laid with 57 kg/m welded rails,&#13;
monoblock prestressed concrete sleepers with elastic rail fastenings and crushed stone&#13;
ballast. These works also include the construction of fences along the new right-of-&#13;
way, and of a 1 km by-pass to separate RFFSA's freight line to Ago Norte installations.&#13;
The realization of these works would demand the relocation of the existing high voltage&#13;
transmission lines, which belong to the energy companies CHESF and CELPE and are&#13;
currently located in their right-of-way, to a new pathway in a neighboring area; and&#13;
(b)    South line. The program entails: (i) the construction of a 13.5 km of double broad&#13;
gauge (1 .60 m) electrified track, from Recife to Cajueiro Seco with the same standards&#13;
as the Central line, including a fenced right-of-way, with a maximum grade of 1&#13;
percent and a minimum radius of 300 m, allowing speeds up to 90 km/h. To carry out&#13;
these works, provisions have been made for the necessary land expropriations and&#13;
resettlements to build 500 m of tracks, linking the Central with the South line at Recife&#13;
and Joana Bezerra stations; (ii) the reallocation of 11 km of one of the existing 1.0 m&#13;
gauge track from Afogados to Cajueiro Seco, for exclusive dedication of RFFSA's&#13;
freight traffic; and (iii) the construction of 11.0 km of a second 1.0 m gauge track from&#13;
Pontezinha to Cabo, this section would continue to be diesel operated for RFFSA's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

freight and CBTU-REC passenger services. The proposed works have been estimated&#13;
to cost about US$38.5 million (including contingencies) or 19 percent of the total&#13;
project cost.&#13;
4.            Systems. A summary description of the systems currently operated by CBTU-RE and&#13;
related components included in the project are presented below:&#13;
(a)    Electrification. For the Central line the electric energy generated by CHESF is&#13;
transmitted to sub-stations owned by the concessionaire CELPE which in turn&#13;
feeds five sub-stations for the operations of the STU-REC system. The network&#13;
of overhead contact lines with power supplied at 3.0 kV DC is well maintained.&#13;
The energy is provided through five sub-stations strategically located in the&#13;
Recife, Ipiranga, Coqueiral, TIP and Jaboatao areas. There are three section&#13;
cabins to reduce the effects of voltage drops and sectionalize the line. The&#13;
entire system is telecommanded through the operational control center (CCO).&#13;
Presently the electric systems are well maintained. This program includes: (i)&#13;
Central line: (a) two circuit breaker feeders for the catenary system; (b) 4.5 km&#13;
of 13.8 kV transmission lines; (c) 4.5 km of overhead catenary (double line) of&#13;
3 kV DC; and (d) relocation of feeder lines at Cavaleiro yard; and (ii) South line:&#13;
(a) the installation of 14.5 km of overhead catenary (double line) with 3 kV DC,&#13;
and motorized switches, and 13.5 km transmission lines of 13.8 kV; and (b)&#13;
the construction of two sub-stations at Castelo Branco and Cajueiro Seco, and&#13;
two sectionalizing cabins at Afogados and Armindo Moura; and the relocation&#13;
of various equipment from existing sub-stations (Jaboatao, TIP, Ipiranga and&#13;
Coqueiral) and two existing cabins (Alto do Ceu and Cavaleiro). The cost of the&#13;
proposed program has been estimated to cost about US$16.2 million (including&#13;
contingencies) or 8 percent of total project cost.&#13;
(b)    Signaling. The existing signaling system in the Central line which includes the&#13;
following components: Ci) Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) which allows a&#13;
Central Operator to set routes for trains by controlling eight remote interlocks&#13;
and to monitor headways and train positions; (ii) Interlocking Relays consisting&#13;
of eight signaling relay rooms located at selected passenger stations to confirm&#13;
the vital interlocking relaying circuits for the traffic safety of STU-REC's trains&#13;
and allow local control of switches in case of failure in the link to CTC; and (iii)&#13;
Automatic Train Control (ATC) consisting of special equipment such as&#13;
transmitters along the track and a cab signaling system on board the EMUs to&#13;
control train speeds within safety limits. The signaling system is in good&#13;
working condition. The traffic in the South line is radio controlled. The&#13;
proposed signaling program would include the installation of: (i) a system with&#13;
the same characteristics as the existing signaling system operating in the&#13;
Central line for the TIP-Timbi extension; and (ii) for the South line: (a) track&#13;
circuits, relay rooms in the stations, code transmitters along the line and&#13;
remote boxes in the CTC; (b) facilities at the Operation Control Center for CTC&#13;
and control of sub-stations; and (c) eight automatic level crossing barriers. This&#13;
component has been estimated to cost US$26.8 million (including&#13;
contingencies) or 13 percent of total project cost.&#13;
(c)    Telecommunications. The telecommunications in the Central line are carried out&#13;
by a special underground cable along the right-of-way. A radio system, links&#13;
the CCO with trains, stations, and maintenance workshops. In addition, the&#13;
system provides telephone communications for general administration and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

operations and also supports clock and public address sub-systems in the&#13;
stations. All communications are recorded. Telecommunications in the South&#13;
line are worked through bare open-wire lines which are unreliable, fault-prone,&#13;
and exposed to weather conditions. They are subject to vandalism and theft,&#13;
requiring continuous repairs and the reinstallation of wires in sections that are&#13;
stolen. The proposed project would include the installation of: (i) a telephone&#13;
exchange system; (ii) a telecommunication system for the TIP-Timbi section,&#13;
with the same characteristics of the existing system operating in the Central&#13;
line; and (iii) a new telecommunication system for the South line consisting of:&#13;
(a) 13.5 km of fiber optic cable and a VHF radio network; (b) public address&#13;
system, ticketing control, clock and track telephone sub-systems; and (c) a&#13;
radio communication sub-system at five stations in the Cajueiro Seco-Cabo&#13;
section. The cost of this component has been estimated at US$5.0 million&#13;
(including contingencies) or 2.5 percent of total project cost.&#13;
5.           Workshop Equipment. The project includes the provision of miscellaneous equipment&#13;
for the maintenance of the track and catenary. The cost of this component has been estimated at&#13;
US$2.7 million (including contingencies) or 1 percent of total project cost.&#13;
6.            Rolling Stock. The existing passenger train fleet or Electric Multiple Units (EMUs) of&#13;
STU-REC in the Central line, consists of 25 broad gauge (1.60 m) units with nine years in service. Each&#13;
unit is composed of four cars (two with motors and two trailers). The units are of stainless steel, have&#13;
61 and 72 seats (cars with motors and trailer cars respectively) with a maximum capacity of 1,278&#13;
passengers per EMU. Their main characteristics are 276 kw per engine (2.2 Megawatts), electric&#13;
controlled, 3 kv overhead feeder, and dynamic brakes all designed to run at a maximum speed of 90&#13;
km/h. Currently, there are 1 2 units operating in service. This is an average availability of 70 percent,&#13;
which is low when compared with international standards (90 to 92 percent availability). The EMU fleet&#13;
has never been subject to general overhauls. Each unit has as an average of 1.2 million travelled km.&#13;
This fact, together with deferred routine maintenance, is affecting the reliability of their performance.&#13;
STU-REC has a fleet of 13 diesel locomotives (900 HP) for the passenger traffic in the South line which&#13;
have been in service since 1958 and 41 ex-RFFSA's coaches, in service since 1957, originally designed&#13;
for long distance passenger service. The train composition consists of one locomotive and four to five&#13;
coaches. Because of the lack of spare parts, obsolete maintenance practices, and some old plant&#13;
equipment with high operating costs, the locomotive and coaches availability is at a low 60 percent&#13;
and 66 percent respectively. In general, the current situation of the locomotive and rolling stock fleet&#13;
is in a precarious situation. The rolling stock program aims at improving the availability and reliability&#13;
of STU-REC entire fleet and includes: (a) the general overhaul of 11 diesel locomotives; (b) the&#13;
rehabilitation and modernization of two diesel locomotives; (c) the general overhaul of 25 EMUs; (d)&#13;
the installation of air conditioning systems in the EMUs; (e) the rehabilitation of 21 passenger coaches&#13;
for the diesel service; and (f) the provision of selected spare parts for the entire fleet. The cost of this&#13;
component has been estimated at US$28.0 million (including contingencies) or 14 percent of total&#13;
project cost.&#13;
7.            Engineering Designs. Final engineering designs for the infrastructure works (track&#13;
works, civil works including fencing of the right-of-way, stations, integrated terminals, road accesses,&#13;
bridges, viaducts and pedestrian over/underpasses) required for the extension of the system from TIP&#13;
to Timbi and for the South line sections Recife-Cajueiro Seco and Cajueiro Seco-Cabo are well&#13;
underway. Related documentation needed for the bidding process together with technical specifications&#13;
are scheduled to be available in July 1 995. The technical specifications for the provision of the&#13;
electrification, signaling, and telecommunications systems, maintenance equipment, and rolling stock&#13;
are programmed to be available by June 1995.&#13;

8.           Supervision. The project includes the provision of consultants (2,475 staff/months) for&#13;
the implementation and supervision of each of the project components mentioned above. The cost of&#13;
these services have been estimated at US$6.0 million (including contingencies) or 3 percent of total&#13;
project cost.&#13;

RECIFE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND TRAFFIC SAFETY COMPONENT&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
1.           This section describes the environmental and traffic safety component of the proposed&#13;
project which includes:&#13;
(a)   the design of a vehicle inspection and maintenance program; and&#13;
(b)   the development of a comprehensive traffic management and control program&#13;
for the RMR with emphasis on the area of influence of the STU-REC.&#13;
In addition, the proposed project includes studies and technical assistance to support improvements&#13;
in motor vehicle emissions control and the development of an integrated transport/environmental&#13;
strategy for the RMR.&#13;
2.           The electrification of the South line and the construction of the TIP-Timbi link would&#13;
result in direct and indirect benefits concerning air quality. Direct benefits would result from the&#13;
reduction in auto and bus traffic due to the new train links; the design of an inspection/maintenance&#13;
program will set the foundations for the implementation of a comprehensive program which will be the&#13;
first step towards curbing vehicle emissions in the RMR. The development of a traffic management,&#13;
control, and safety program would also have a beneficial effect on vehicle emissions and accidents,&#13;
especially in and around existing at-grade crossings which would be grade separated. Indirect air&#13;
quality benefits would result from the development and implementation of an integrated transport and&#13;
air quality strategy, and from strengthening of vehicle emissions planning, regulation, and enforcement.&#13;
B. Environmental Sub-Component&#13;
3.           Inspection and maintenance (I/M) serves two purposes in a vehicle emissions control&#13;
program. First, it helps to identify vehicles in which maladjustments or other mechanical problems are&#13;
causing higher emissions than necessary. Second, it ensures that the emission control equipment on&#13;
vehicles so equipped remains in place and operational, so that the emissions benefits of that equipment&#13;
are realized. The first purpose applies mostly to older vehicles without emission controls; for emission-&#13;
controlled vehicles, the second is much more important. An effective l/M program is essential to ensure&#13;
that the emissions benefits projected for the adoption of new vehicle emissions standards are actually&#13;
attained. The project finances the design of an l/M program and will recommend how the l/M program&#13;
can be implemented through concessions to the private sector.&#13;
C. Traffic Safety Program&#13;
4.           The objective of the traffic management component is to design and put in place a&#13;
number of traffic management and safety policies and investments which, when coupled with the rail&#13;
and air quality component, will enhance the quality of public transport, reduce congestion, and greatly&#13;
improve safety.&#13;
5.           The Traffic management component of the proposed project would comprise the design&#13;
of: (a) the Traffic Control subcomponent; and (b) the Traffic Safety subcomponent. They are described&#13;
below in detail.&#13;

Cl. Traffic Control Subcomponent&#13;
6.            Semi-actuated Traffic Lights. Electro-mechanical "old style" traffic light controllers make&#13;
coordination among separate locations difficult without interconnections. In some locations the causes&#13;
of accidents have been traced to this limitation. Such is the case, for example, with the intersection&#13;
between a main road with high traffic volume and a very low volume secondary road, which however&#13;
presents significant flows at peak periods. During off-peak hours, long periods of red for the main road,&#13;
without a corresponding traffic flow from the side street, often prompt drivers to "go through" the red&#13;
light, which will eventually lead to an accident. It is estimate that 95 percent of the locations across&#13;
the city area require replacement of the existing traffic signal controller by a semi-actuated model, with&#13;
loop detectors, which will be able to adequately handle demand variations throughout the day. Twenty&#13;
other unsignalized intersections require implementation of semi-actuated traffic light systems, some&#13;
with a cycle that will include phases to accommodate pedestrian crossing movements.&#13;
C2. Traffic Safety Subcomponent&#13;
7.            Traffic Management and Safety. An important objective of the project is to reduce&#13;
congestion and improve safety. A new traffic signal system is proposed. However, a more definitive&#13;
safety program needed to be defined to complement the on-going efforts of the Municipality. As a&#13;
minimum, this program includes:&#13;
(a)    a description of current safety activities;&#13;
(b)    identification of most serious accident locations and their deficiencies, and&#13;
selection of those to be included in the project;&#13;
(c)    definition of a program to specifically address the high rate of pedestrian&#13;
accidents;&#13;
Id)    approximate costs and implementation schedule to correct the deficiencies in&#13;
(b) and implement the program in (c). Identify the agency responsible for&#13;
implementation of the program(s); and&#13;
(e)    prepare designs for any civil work required.&#13;
This program is summarized in documents which were submitted to the Bank and the proposed&#13;
component was based on that program.&#13;
C3. Policy Issues&#13;
8.            The importance of appropriate policy measures to achieve the ultimate objective of&#13;
reducing the rate of motorization in RMR and consequent delays, pollution, and excessive use of fuel&#13;
was emphasized by the Bank. DETRAN will develop an action plan and TOR for studies which call for&#13;
(among other issues identified in the appraisal process) the following:&#13;
(a)    a parking policy and implementation plan which correctly charges for the use&#13;
of valuable downtown space for "automobile storage" and provides a&#13;
disincentive for people to drive to the central area rather than use public&#13;
transport. This implies the need for a comprehensive, safe and comfortable&#13;
public transport system into which the public and private sector are currently&#13;
investing hundreds of millions of dollars. The action plan calls for specific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                                ANNEX 6&#13;
implementation of the recommendations of the parking plan by the third or&#13;
fourth year of the project with some measures beginning earlier;&#13;
(b)    pricing mechanisms which will ultimately be the only real deterrent to&#13;
continued automobile traffic growth in the central area. Experience throughout&#13;
the world indicates that the effect of metros is temporary if at all; the metro&#13;
provides the alternative mode which allows appropriate pricing and provides&#13;
some disincentive to drive into the central area. Without the ultimate achieve-&#13;
ment of a reduction in the growth of automobile traffic in the city, the&#13;
investment in the metro is questionable. A pricing policy and plan of imple-&#13;
mentation is to be developed as part of the project, and implementation will&#13;
begin as the metro is nearing completion; and&#13;
(c)   frequently circulating vehicles (taxis, buses, government vehicles) contribute&#13;
to pollution in the city and provide a controllable environment within which to&#13;
test the value of alternative fuels as a measure of reducing harmful emissions.&#13;
A pilot program using Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) will be developed and&#13;
initiated, with the objective of testing the proposal of not allowing buses or&#13;
taxis to operate in the city center unless they use clean-burning fuels.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RECIFE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY COMPONENT&#13;
1.           This Annex describes the studies and training to be undertaken as a basis for the policy&#13;
and institutional development action plan. The studies will be divided in three categories: (a) studies&#13;
which are related only to CBTU; (b) studies to enhance modal integration; and (c) studies which&#13;
examine the decentralization and financing mechanisms aspects. The training component should&#13;
contribute to the skill upgrading of staff at all levels through recycling as well as training in-house and&#13;
abroad.&#13;
2.           A list of the proposed studies and training is presented below. Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
for each study were agreed at appraisal and were ready by negotiations.&#13;
A. CBTU Studies&#13;
3.           Preparation and implementation of a manpower development and organization plan with&#13;
staff rationalization. This study will review the organization of each of the new systems by functional&#13;
area and as a whole. It will provide job descriptions for each of the main posts and a strategy to&#13;
rationalize the staff. It will review the salary scale and benefits and, based on equivalent positions in&#13;
the private sector, propose a new salary scale and a chronogram for its implementation. It will also&#13;
define the training requirements and recycling to be undertaken under the training component. Finally,&#13;
it will propose a new admissions policy based on needs.&#13;
4.           Preparation of a cost accounting, tariff, management information systems, and financial&#13;
management study. At this stage, it is clear that the existing systems need a good costing group which&#13;
is capable of determining the long-run variable costs of the system and for that purpose separate the&#13;
fixed costs from the variable costs. In addition, the accounting and finance directorate should be&#13;
equipped with the required management information systems to allow a timely analysis of the costs.&#13;
Finally, the Planning Department should be prepared to estimate and operate on a regular basis the&#13;
tariff schedule, integrated tariffs, multi-trip tariffs, etc., using the information from the cost systems,&#13;
information from the competitive modes and socio-economic constraints.&#13;
5.           Preparation of an action plan (and its implementation) to improve the management of&#13;
stocks. The system should have a computerized inventory management which will allow internal&#13;
control and prevent lack of spares due to poor programming. This action plan should be implemented&#13;
soon and will contribute to better rolling stock availability.&#13;
6.           Preparation of proposals to subcontract maintenance and other operations to the private&#13;
sector. This study should examine the operational activities which could be subcontracted to the&#13;
private sector at competitive prices (at least two competing sources) and indicate the staff reductions&#13;
which can be achieved and potential operating savings if those activities are subcontracted.&#13;
7.           Action and revenue plan through promotion of station space, advertising and real estate&#13;
development on CBTU's real estate, and action plan for their implementation. This plan should indicate&#13;
very clearly what are the non-operating revenues which each of the CBTU new systems can earn&#13;
through promotion of station space, advertising and real estate development. The study should provide&#13;
a detailed estimate of income and costs and suggest how the proposed plan should be implemented,&#13;
i.e., in-house or through outside parties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

8.           Marketing STU-REC's Image. STU-REC's image is very poor especially insofar as the&#13;
South line is concerned. After the system is decentralized, management must undertake a marketing&#13;
campaign to improve CBTU's image and attract new ridership. This study will discuss proposals to&#13;
improve CBTU's image, the marketing plan to implement them, and the incentives to attract new&#13;
ridership.&#13;
B. Modal Integration Studies&#13;
9.           A study to update the Transport portion of the Master Plan for RMR with emphasis on&#13;
route rationalization, modal and tariff integration. The RMR Master Plan should be updated to account&#13;
for the Municipality of Recife's Master Plan and recent changes in land use. Basic guidelines for the&#13;
development of future systems must be prepared.&#13;
10.          Feasibility study and preliminary design of integration terminals in the RMR, with&#13;
identification of private sector participation. Modal integration is one of the main priorities of this&#13;
project. In the RMR, the lack of integration terminals has not facilitated modal integration. Exploration&#13;
of integration terminals by the private sector may induce rerouting of buses to the railway stations,&#13;
thereby reducing congestion. This study will examine main integration terminals in the RMR and&#13;
identify opportunities for their management by the private sector.&#13;
C. Financing Mechanisms&#13;
11.          Financing mechanisms study with recommendations on how to cover operating deficits&#13;
and capital investment, action plan and chronogram for implementation. This study will identify the&#13;
financing mechanisms available and those proposed to cover the operating subsidies and capital&#13;
investment requirements of STU-REC. Federal, State and Municipality contributions should be clearly&#13;
identified. The study should make concrete recommendations and prepare a draft of Decrees to be&#13;
discussed by the State legislature to provide the funds required. The study should also discuss how&#13;
these funds should be allocated and the role of the RTCC in assigning these subsidies.&#13;
12.          EMTU strengthening. This study will recommend how EMTU's functions should be&#13;
expanded to include the rail mode and will make concrete recommendations on how EMTU will interact&#13;
with the STU-REC.&#13;
D. Decentralization Studies&#13;
13.          Preparation and implementation of a plan to hand-over STU-REC, including the legal,&#13;
financial and institutional arrangements. This study will produce a detailed action plan for the transfer&#13;
of the CBTU subdivision to the State. In the action plan, all legal, financial and institutional&#13;
arrangements to be undertaken at each step will be identified. Preparatory work, such as inventory of&#13;
assets of STU-REC, will be done at this stage.&#13;
E. Management Information Systems&#13;
14.          This component is intended to provide each of the new CBTU system with the basic&#13;
software and hardware required to perform the needed accounting, financial management and planning&#13;
functions.&#13;

F. Training&#13;
15.          Training will take place at all levels of the organization as proposed in the&#13;
recommendations of the Manpower Development studies. The training may consist of in-house, on-the-&#13;
job training, or visits and courses abroad in specific areas.&#13;
G. Implementation Program&#13;
16.          Policy and Institutional Development Action Plan&#13;
(a)    Decentralization Action Plan of the STU-REC System. In carrying out the&#13;
decentralization of the System, CBTU and the State shall:&#13;
{i)    not later than September 30, 1996 complete a study and an action&#13;
plan for the transfer of the STU-REC System to the State. In the action&#13;
plan, all legal, financial and institutional arrangements to be&#13;
undertaken, as well as the inventory of assets of STU-REC, will be&#13;
included (CBTU, State);&#13;
(ii)   not later than September 30, 1 996 complete a study which will&#13;
determine the long-run variable costs of the STU-REC System, using&#13;
the most appropriate methods available, and will propose the creation&#13;
of a data base for more accurate costing and recommend a tariff&#13;
system which is cost-based and takes into account modal integration&#13;
and affordability issues (CBTU, State);&#13;
(iii)   not later than October 31, 1 996 complete a study and an action plan&#13;
for the setting up of a cost accounting system and management&#13;
information systems for the STU-REC System (State, CBTU);&#13;
(iv)   not later than October 31, 1 996 complete a study on the financing&#13;
mechanisms required to cover operating deficits and capital investment&#13;
and propose an action plan and chronogram for their implementation in&#13;
the STU-REC System. Federal, State and Municipal contributions should&#13;
be clearly identified (CBTU, State); and&#13;
(v)    not later than October 31, 1996 complete the preparation of contract&#13;
plans between STU-REC or its successors and the State. This study is&#13;
intended to prepare a detailed contract plan document with basic&#13;
performance and financial targets and note the obligations of each of&#13;
the parties (State).&#13;
(b)    Management Action Plan of the STU-REC System. In carrying out a&#13;
management action plan to improve the performance of the System, CBTU and&#13;
the State shall:&#13;
{i)    not later than June 30, 1996 prepare and implement a manpower&#13;
development and organization plan to streamline the management and&#13;
operations staff in STU-REC, to propose concise job descriptions and&#13;
to staff them accordingly (State, CBTU);&#13;
(ii)   not later than June 30, 1 996 prepare and implement an action plan to&#13;
improve the management of stocks for STU-REC which will include a&#13;

computerized inventory management to improve internal control and&#13;
prevent lack of spares due to poor programming (State, CBTU);&#13;
(iii)   not later than December 31, 1996 prepare and implement an action&#13;
plan to subcontract maintenance and other operations to the private&#13;
sector. This study should examine the operational activities which&#13;
could be subcontracted to the private sector at competitive prices (at&#13;
least two competing sources) and indicate the staff reductions which&#13;
can be achieved and potential operating savings if those activities are&#13;
subcontracted (State, CBTU);&#13;
(iv)   not later than December 31, 1996 prepare and implement an action&#13;
and revenue plan through promotion of station space, advertising and&#13;
real estate development for the STU-REC. This plan should indicate&#13;
clearly what are the non-operating revenues which STU-REC can earn&#13;
through promotion of station space, advertising and real estate&#13;
development. The study should provide a detailed estimate of income&#13;
and costs and suggest how the proposed plan should be implemented,&#13;
i.e., in-house or through outside parties (State); and&#13;
(v)    not later than December 31, 1996 prepare an action plan to market the&#13;
STU-REC. After the system is decentralized, management must&#13;
undertake a marketing campaign to improve the STU-REC System's&#13;
image and attract new ridership. This study will discuss proposals to&#13;
improve the System's image, the marketing plan to implement them&#13;
and the incentives to attract new ridership (State).&#13;
(c)    Modal Integration Action Plan of the STU-REC system. In carrying out the&#13;
modal integration component of the project, the CBTU and the State shall:&#13;
(i)    not later than March 31, 1996 complete a study and plan of action to&#13;
integrate STU-REC and the bus system. CBTU's integration with the&#13;
bus system is an objective already set by the State. This study will&#13;
propose alternatives for the physical, organizational, and financial&#13;
merger of the two systems. It will make recommendations to the State&#13;
on how to proceed with the merger (State, CBTU); and&#13;
(ii)   not later than December 31, 1 996 complete a study to update a&#13;
proposed master plan for integration of transport services in the RMR&#13;
(the Master Plan) with emphasis on route rationalization, modal and&#13;
tariff integration. The Master Plan will be updated to emphasize the&#13;
integration between buses and the rail system. If need be, an origin-&#13;
destination traffic survey will also be included. Basic guidelines for the&#13;
development of new systems and integration terminals must be&#13;
outlined.&#13;
(d)    Training Action Plan of the STU-REC system. In carrying out the training action&#13;
plan of the project, the CBTU and the State shall:&#13;
(i)    not later than June 30, 1 996 initiate a training action plan at all levels&#13;
of the STU-REC organization taking into account the recommendations&#13;
of the manpower development and organization study.&#13;

RECIFE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           Separate standard cost-benefit analyses were performed to evaluate the economic&#13;
impact of the implementation of the proposed South line modernization and extension and the TIP-&#13;
Timbi link, which together represent 98 percent of the total proposed project. This Annex describes&#13;
the demand analysis and the set of benefits and costs that have been considered in the economic&#13;
evaluation, as well as the assumptions adopted regarding key inputs, such as the value of time. Direct&#13;
user benefits include travel time, operating cost savings, and the investments avoided due to the&#13;
proposed project; indirect benefits arise from the reduction of negative externalities (accident and air&#13;
pollution costs). Investment costs comprise civil works, land expropriation, operational systems, rolling&#13;
stock and project studies. Both benefits and costs are defined as incremental compared to the situation&#13;
without the project. Throughout the analysis, and for illustrative purposes, the proposed investments&#13;
were evaluated with and without the accident and air pollution externalities. A more detailed&#13;
description of the data and assumptions supporting the economic evaluation summarized in this annex&#13;
can be found in Reports No. 7, 8 and 9 in the Project Files.&#13;
2.           This economic evaluation estimates the discounted expected present value of the&#13;
infrastructure investment's net benefits, the expected internal economic rates of return, as well as the&#13;
expected benefit/cost ratios for a set of discount rates, which includes the 1 0 percent discount rate,&#13;
which has been defined by SEAIN (Secretary of Planning for the Federative Republic of Brazil), as well&#13;
by its Commission of External Financing (COFIEX) for the project appraisal of foreign investments. In&#13;
addition, the sensitivity analysis included in this annex provides an idea of how the economic rates of&#13;
return would change due to deviations from the value of benefits and costs used in the base case. The&#13;
analysis is then complemented by a table of impacts of the project which are evaluated on a qualitative&#13;
basis.&#13;
B. Choice of a Project Base Case&#13;
3.           Mass Transit Options. Following current Bank policy recommendations for the appraisal&#13;
of mass transit investments contained in the Urban Transport Policy Paper (World Bank, 1 986) the&#13;
proposed investments for the electrification and extension of the South line were compared against&#13;
a total segregated busway with regular buses, a total segregated busways with articulated buses, and&#13;
an improved rail diesel service. In all cases, the analyses showed that the proposed investments had&#13;
a higher internal rate of return. Similarly, the proposed investments for the TIP-Timbi link was&#13;
compared against a segregated busway with regular buses and with articulated buses.&#13;
C. Demand Analysis&#13;
4.           Current Demand Levels. The 1994 peak-hour demand levels in the area of influence of&#13;
the TIP-Timbi link (Caxanga Avenue corridor) were: 21,850 bus passengers/hour/inbound. The 1994&#13;
peak-hour demand levels in the area of influence of the South line (Mascarenhas de Morais corridor)&#13;
were 28,632 bus passengers/hour/inbound.&#13;

Demand Modelling&#13;
5.            The demand estimates used in the economic evaluation are the result of a simulation&#13;
of the Recife Metropolitan Region transport network, performed with the Mantra System 21&#13;
microcomputer program. The urban transport demand model used by this program is a classical&#13;
aggregate four-stage transport planning model, which comprises trip generation, trip distribution, modal&#13;
split, and trip assignment. This model estimates peak (6 hours) and off-peak (10 hours) periods of&#13;
public transport demand, which are assigned to bus, rail and Metro lines.&#13;
6.            The model Mantra is integrated with a Geographic Information System, GisPlus.3' In&#13;
order to use the model, it was necessary to create a GIS database for Recife Metropolitan Region,&#13;
which comprises a Zoning layer and a Transport network layer (made up of line and node layers).&#13;
7.            The zoning system adopted is based in the 51 RMR districts, which were digitized into&#13;
GisPlus. Some districts were disaggregated near the rail/metro transit lines and others in the more&#13;
distant areas were aggregated. The demand study considered the EMTU Public Transport workday&#13;
origin/destination (OD) matrix for 1 994. The total number of trips of this matrix is close to the current&#13;
1.7 million public transport passenger trips in the region. The matrix break down into trip purposes was&#13;
based in a survey carried out by CBTU/Recife, showing that 59 percent of the trips are commuting,&#13;
1 2 percent are business and 29 percent are related to other trip purposes.&#13;
8.            Public transport demand data was available on a daily basis. The break down into peak&#13;
and off-peak periods was done using information from the EMTU/Recife. This authority has provided&#13;
information for each bus line, and on the number of passenger being transported per hour of day. Peak&#13;
hour periods considered were the following: 06:00 - 09:00 a.m. and 16:00 - 19:00 p.m. The number&#13;
of trips in this period corresponds to 55 percent of the weekday ridership.&#13;
9.            The steps in the demand modelling exercise were:&#13;
(a)    Trip Generation. This step consists of the estimation of the number of trips&#13;
which will be produced by and attracted to the area of influence of the&#13;
investments considered in the study. It was conservatively assumed that the&#13;
current EMTU OD matrix is a good estimate up to year 2001. After this year,&#13;
a yearly demand growth of 1 percent per year was considered. Car and walking&#13;
trips were not considered at all.&#13;
(b)    Trip Distribution. This step consists of the determination of the origin zone and&#13;
destination zone for each trip based on the types of trips produced by and&#13;
attracted to each zone and the interzonal "impedance" values (typically travel&#13;
times). Also in this case there is the assumption of using the current matrix as&#13;
an estimate up to the year 2001.&#13;
(c)    Modal choice consists of the calculation of which trips will use the bus&#13;
network, the metro system and the railway lines. The Mantra model allows the&#13;
competition between single modes and combined modes. The modal choice&#13;
model used is the hierarchical multi-nomial Logit model. It is important to point&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

out that for each zone pair of interest, for the area of influence of the Central&#13;
line or the South line, there will always be competition between bus,&#13;
metro+bus and rail+metro+bus. The model utility functions considered the&#13;
same values of travel time used in the economic evaluation.&#13;
(d)    Trip assignment consists of the "loading" of the passenger trips onto the&#13;
multimodal public transport network. The method used to assign the trips made&#13;
within each single (bus) or combined mode (metro + bus and rail + metro + bus),&#13;
is the "all or nothing" procedure, with no capacity restraint iterations. The&#13;
reason to use this procedure is the fact that car trips were not considered in&#13;
the present transport demand modelling exercise.&#13;
10.          The transport model was applied for the situation "without" and "with" the project in&#13;
both cases using the South line and the TIP-Timbi link. The outputs obtained from the application of&#13;
the model are the number of trips, passenger-kms and passenger-hours by each individual mode: bus,&#13;
rail and metro. By running the model for the situation "without" and "with," data were obtained on the&#13;
additional trips in the metro and rail modes, and also the decrease in bus trips which result from the&#13;
construction of the proposed project. The following paragraphs summarize the situation "without" and&#13;
"with" the South line project. The results in terms of passenger-trips, passenger-kilometers, passenger-&#13;
hours and average speeds are summarized below:&#13;
(a)    Situation "Without Project" (Year 2001). The main traffic characteristics of the&#13;
study area in the situation "without" the project are: average bus speeds of&#13;
16.97 km/hour with a daily total of 1,481,380 passengers and 29,329,705&#13;
passenger-kms generated by bus trips with origins or destinations in the RMR.&#13;
The corresponding number of passenger hours is 1,727,838. The metro trips&#13;
generated for origins/destinations in the study area a total of 147,584&#13;
passengers and 1,376,844 passenger-kms, corresponding to 30,597&#13;
passenger-hours. Rail trips generated by origin/destinations in the study area&#13;
corresponds to 38,290 passengers and 392,189 passenger-kms and 12,326&#13;
passenger-hours. The transit modal choice in terms of trips generated by the&#13;
study area would be 88.9 percent bus, 8.9 percent metro and 2.3 ,percent rail.&#13;
(b)    Situation "With Project - South Line" (Year 2001). On a daily basis, the&#13;
average bus speeds in the study area would rise to 17.04 km/h and demand&#13;
for bus transportation would go down to 1,351,509 passengers, with&#13;
27,736,278 passenger-kms and 1,627,641 passenger-hours. The demand for&#13;
metro trips in the study area (Central line and South line) will go up to a total&#13;
of 315,745 passengers with 3,108,320 passenger-kms and 69,076 passenger-&#13;
hours. Rail demand, considering only the diesel line to Cabo shall be of 29,641&#13;
passengers, with 400,644 passenger-kms and 12,592 passenger-hours. The&#13;
transit modal choice will then be 79.7 percent bus, 18.6 percent metro&#13;
(including South line), and 1.7 percent rail.&#13;
(c)    Situation "With Project - TIP-Timbi link" (Year 2001). The average bus speeds&#13;
in the study area would rise to 1 7.55 km/h and demand for bus transportation&#13;
would go down to 1,447,667 passengers with 25,770,552 passenger-kms and&#13;
1,455,853 passenger-hours. The demand for metro (Central line) trips in the&#13;
study area will go up to a total of 181,300 with 1,804,165 passenger-kms and&#13;
40,094 passenger-hours. Rail demand shall remain with 38,290 passengers,&#13;
392,1 89 passenger-kms and 1 2,326 passenger-hours. The transit modal choice&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

will then 86.8 percent bus, 10.9 percent metro (Central line), and 2.3 percent&#13;
rail&#13;
Demand Estimates&#13;
11.          The demand estimates for the "do-nothing" situation (to be understood as the present&#13;
situation plus an estimated US$10 million/year over 5.5 years to make remedial improvements such&#13;
as road bypasses, small bridges, lane widening) in the year 2001 indicate a total of about 186,000&#13;
weekday boardings and an annual ridership of more than 60 million passengers.&#13;
12.          The demand estimates for the Central line (TIP-Timbi link alternative) in the year 2001&#13;
indicate: (a) a peak-hour inbound volume of about 19,958 passengers; (b) a peak-hour outbound&#13;
volume of 3,266 passengers; (c) a total increase over the "do-nothing" alternative of about 33,769&#13;
weekday boardings (for the whole system); and (d1 an annual ridership increase of more than 10 million&#13;
passengers.&#13;
13.          The demand estimates for the South line investment in the year 2001 indicate: (a) a&#13;
peak-hour inbound volume of about 1 5,591 passengers; (b) a peak-hour outbound volume of 3,482&#13;
passengers; (c) a total increase over the "do-nothing" alternative of about 129,927 weekday&#13;
boardings; and (d) an annual increase of ridership of more than 42 million passengers.&#13;

D. Benefits&#13;
Value of Time&#13;
14.           Mass transit projects can hardly be economically justified without accounting for the&#13;
real resource savings that economies of time represent. The monetary value of time by which the time&#13;
savings are multiplied to obtain the benefits from time savings is a key input in the economic evaluation&#13;
of the infrastructure components of this project. Individual values of time are traditionally considered&#13;
to be a function of income, in particular a function of the individual wage level. Thus, the value of time&#13;
used in the calculation of time savings is derived from the income distribution of users, disaggregated&#13;
by transport mode and trip purpose, and from information on wage levels. Table 9.4 shows the income&#13;
of public transport users, in the zone of influence of the South line and disaggregated by mode. The&#13;
information was obtained from the Bus and CBTU surveys of their users conducted in 1 994.&#13;
15.           The minimum wage used was R$70 which at the shadow price of 1 is equivalent to&#13;
US$ 70. From this minimum wage base, the value of fringe benefits was considered separate from&#13;
payroll taxes. Fringe benefits in Brazil include vacation and the 1 3th month of salary; both entail scaling&#13;
the base salary by a factor of 1 .25. Commuting and other purpose trips are valued as a proportion of&#13;
net wages. This implies subtracting direct taxes paid by the employee from the base wage, which&#13;
includes fringe benefits. The employee is subject to a payroll tax that varies between 8 percent and&#13;
10 percent. In addition, the income tax should be subtracted. By assuming that one-third of passengers&#13;
are not tax-exempt and do not evade taxes, the net wage deflating factor will be in the 0.92-0.88&#13;
range. An average factor of 0.9 was used. Business trips are valued at gross wages, where fringe&#13;
benefits and payroll taxes are taken into account. Payroll taxes in Brazil vary between 38 percent and&#13;
45 percent and about 35 percent are paid by the employer. By combining fringe benefits and employer&#13;
contribution on payroll taxes, the base wage must be scaled by a factor of 1.60 (1.25 plus 0.35).&#13;
1 6.          Hourly wages for each transport mode users are estimated by multiplying the individual&#13;
wage (in minimum wages) by the value of the minimum wage and dividing the result by 1 57, the&#13;
assumed average number of hours worked in a given month. Common practice in the appraisal of urban&#13;
transport projects is to use a proportion of the hourly wage rate to approximate the value of time&#13;
saved. This proportion as well as the wage rate base chosen for the calculation-whether gross or net&#13;
wages-depend on the type of trip. Three types of trip can be distinguished for the purposes of the&#13;
analysis: home-to-work trips (or commuting trips), work-related trips (or business trips), and non-work&#13;
related trips (or other trips), for example shopping or visiting the doctor. Economic theory indicates that&#13;
both commuting trips and other trips should be valued as a proportion of the net wage. Empirical&#13;
evidence suggests that this proportion may vary between 20 and 1 00 percent. The value adopted in&#13;
the economic evaluation was a value of 1 7.5 percent based on a study undertaken a few years ago&#13;
for a similar city of the northeast with the same type of population. A 20 percent value was tested as&#13;
part of the sensitivity analysis. Economic theory also indicates that business trips during working hours&#13;
be valued at 1 00 percent of the gross wage rate."' The resulting values of time used in the economic&#13;
evaluation are summarized in Tables 9.8 and 9.14 and the proportion of passenger-hours spent&#13;
travelling by type of trip is summarized in Tables 9.9 and 9.10.&#13;
4/    In developed countries, estimates of the value of time for journey to work ranges from 20 to 100 percent of the gross&#13;
wage rate. A recent review of the literature concludes that a reasonable average value of time for journey to work&#13;
is 50 percent of the gross wage rate. See Kenneth Small, Urban Transportation Economics, Harwood Academic&#13;

Direct Benefits&#13;
17.          Direct benefits estimated in the economic evaluation are travel time savings, opreting&#13;
cost savings, bus system control savings, and road maintenance cost savings:&#13;
(a)    Travel time savings result mainly from the transfer of bus passengers into the&#13;
new lines, and from existing metro and rail passengers who can save time in&#13;
their trips by taking advantage of the new transport facility. Travel time savings&#13;
also result from the increased operating speeds of the buses that continue&#13;
operation and, to a lesser extent, of car traffic. The program used to model the&#13;
demand works with an origin-destination matrix where the number of trips is&#13;
fixed. The number of "legs" comprising those trips may vary. When the new&#13;
South line (or TIP-Timbil is introduced in the network, the modal split is&#13;
affected and some trip itineraries change. Thus, the demand model estimates&#13;
the diverted demand, but it does not estimate the so-called generated demand,&#13;
that is, the additional trips that will be potentially generated throughout the&#13;
RMR, but particularly in the corridors directly affected by the investment.&#13;
Omission of generated demand yields a conservative level of demand and,&#13;
consequently, results in a lower rate of return. Travel time savings are&#13;
measured for each mode by the difference between the total number of&#13;
morning peak passenger-hours spent without the project and those spent with&#13;
the project. These peak-hour estimates are converted to annual values and then&#13;
multiplied by the assumed value of time to obtain a monetary value of time&#13;
savings. The net change in travel time across the four modes is considered to&#13;
be the overall measure of the travel time savings;&#13;
{[Pass-hr (w/o) - Pass-hr (w)I x VoT x PHF x ND} - 1,000, where Pass-hr are&#13;
passenger-hours, VoT is the value of time, PHF is the peak-hour factor, and ND&#13;
is the number of operating days in a year.&#13;
(b)    Operating cost savings for the non-rail modes derive principally from the&#13;
improved commercial and traffic speeds, which can be achieved by buses and&#13;
cars, respectively. Operating cost savings are measured for each mode by the&#13;
difference between the morning peak passenger-kilometers carried without the&#13;
project and those carried with the project. All trips were considered irrespective&#13;
of their purpose. These peak-hour estimates are converted to annual values and&#13;
then multiplied by the assumed values of operating cost per passenger-&#13;
kilometer for each mode to obtain a monetary value of operating cost savings.&#13;
The net change in operating costs across the four modes is considered to be&#13;
the overall measure of operating cost savings. Operating cost savings include&#13;
wages and salaries, materials, energy and general expenditures. An alternative&#13;
method to estimate these savings was to calculate the actual number of buses&#13;
eliminated at peak hour due to the construction of the line and estimate the&#13;
savings due to the elimination of the buses and reduction in bus kilometers&#13;
produced. Tables 9.5 and 9.11 show the calculations used.&#13;
{[Pass-km (w/o) x OC (w/of] - [Pass-km (w) x OC (w)] x PHF x ND) . 1,000,&#13;
where OC are operating costs per passenger-kilometer.&#13;
(c)    Bus system control cost savings depend critically on the reduction of the bus&#13;
vehicle fleet, which is assumed to follow from the reduction in bus patronage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

after the metro line opens. Bus system control cost savings are measured by&#13;
a given percentage (8 percent) of bus operating costs.&#13;
(d)    Road maintenance cost savings derive from the possibility of delaying periodic&#13;
maintenance mainly because of reduced bus traffic on the corridors under&#13;
consideration. The benefits from reduced vehicle operating costs resulting from&#13;
reduced pavement damage are not considered.&#13;
{[Pass-km (w/o) - Pass-km Iw)] x RMC x PHF x ND} - 1,000 where RMC are&#13;
road maintenance cost savings per passenger-kilometer.&#13;
Indirect Benefits&#13;
1 8.         Indirect benefits arise from the reduction in externalities, such as accidents and air&#13;
pollution:&#13;
(a)    Accident cost savings are measured for each mode by the difference between&#13;
the morning peak passenger-kilometers carried without the project and those&#13;
carried with the project. These peak-hour estimates are converted to annual&#13;
values and then multiplied by the assumed values of accident costs per 1,000&#13;
passenger-kilometer for each mode to obtain a monetary value of accident cost&#13;
savings. The net change in accident costs across the four modes is considered&#13;
to be the overall measure of accident cost savings. Accident costs include&#13;
property damage, injuries and loss of life.&#13;
([(Pass-km (w/o)) . 1,000 - (Pass-km (w)) - 1,0001 x ACC x PHF x ND) -&#13;
1,000, where ACC are accident cost savings per 1000 passenger kilometer.&#13;
(b)    Air pollution cost savings are measured for bus and cars by the difference&#13;
between the morning peak passenger-kilometers carried without the project and&#13;
those carried with the project. These peak-hour estimates are deflated by the&#13;
average vehicle occupancy (to obtain costs per vehicle-kilometer) then&#13;
converted to annual values, and finally multiplied by the assumed values of air&#13;
pollution costs per vehicle-kilometer to obtain a monetary value of air pollution&#13;
cost savings. The air pollution factor (US$/gram) of emission reduction)&#13;
represents the total health and welfare benefits associated with the reduced&#13;
pollution emissions resulting from the proposed investments. Health benefits&#13;
include reduced morbidity and mortality whereas welfare benefits include the&#13;
reductions in soiling and corrosion of buildings and other structures. The net&#13;
change in air pollution costs in the bus and car modes is considered to be the&#13;
overall measure of air pollution cost savings. The set of air pollutants&#13;
considered include carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides&#13;
(NO.), sulphur oxides (SO.) and fine particulate matter (PM 10).&#13;
(([Pass-km (w/o) - Pass-km (w)] x APC x PHF x ND) . AOF}   1,000 x where&#13;
APC are air pollution cost savings per passenger-kilometer and AOF is the&#13;
average vehicle occupancy factor.&#13;
E. Costs&#13;
19.          Investment Costs. Investment cost components were grouped for the economic&#13;
evaluation into land expropriations, civil works, operating systems, rolling stock, and costs of projects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75-                                   ANNEX 9&#13;
and studies. Annex 8 contains a detailed breakdown of the capital cost structure. To obtain the&#13;
economic cost stream for both links, taxes were subtracted from the total costs (including physical and&#13;
price contingencies) shown in Annex 8 and multiplied by a shadow value factor of 0.9.&#13;
20.          Operating Costs. The incremental operating costs due to the investments are wages&#13;
and salaries, materials, energy and general expenditures (e.g., auditing, legal costs, transport, and&#13;
cleaning services).&#13;
21.          Discount Rate. In calculating the net present value for the underground and rail&#13;
integration components of the project a discount rate must be selected which represents the&#13;
opportunity cost of capital in Brazil. The discount rate used as "benchmark" by SEAIN (Secretary of&#13;
Planning) for foreign investments, as well as COFIEX (Commission of External Financing) is 10 percent.&#13;
F. Results of Economic Evaluation&#13;
22.           Separate economic evaluations were performed for the South line and for the TIP-Timbi&#13;
links. Internal economic rates of return (IERR), net present values (NPV), and Benefit/Cost ratios (B/C)&#13;
were calculated. The assumed project life is 25 years. Residual values were estimated at the end of&#13;
the project life for the civil works, operating systems and rolling stock. These residual values were&#13;
calculated following CBTU accounting procedures that assume a linear depreciation rate, which vary&#13;
according to the expected operational life of the components.&#13;
Distribution of Costs and Benefits&#13;
23.          Table 9.7 shows the annual series of expected benefits and costs for the South line in&#13;
the base case scenario.&#13;
24.          Table 9.13 shows the annual series of expected benefits and costs for the TIP-Timbi&#13;
link in the base case scenario.&#13;
Net Present Values&#13;
25.          The discounted expected present value of benefits for both investments net of costs,&#13;
are positive in the relevant range, which includes the discount rate of 10 percent (see Tables 9.7 and&#13;
9.13).&#13;
Internal Economic Rates of Return&#13;
26.          The estimated IERR for the base case selected for the South line is given in Table 9.4.&#13;
The estimated IERR for the base case selected for the TIP-Timbi is given in Table 9.10.&#13;
27.          A combined IERR calculation for the South line and TIP-Timbi link was carried out&#13;
adding the individual net present value flows for each part yielding a combined IERR of 27.9 percent&#13;
under base case scenarios.&#13;
First-year Benefit Test&#13;
28.          A "first-year" benefit test was performed to assess whether the investments are&#13;
premature. Tables 9.9 and 9.15 show the results of the test for discount rates of 10 percent and 12&#13;
percent. For both discount rates the proposed investments have benefits larger than the rate of&#13;
discount multiplied by the net present value of total investment costs in the planned year of start-up&#13;
&#13;

of operations. This suggests that there are no additional net benefits to be gained if the implementation&#13;
of the project is delayed from the schedule assumed in the base case scenario.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
29.          A sensitivity analysis was performed for both investments to estimate the variance of&#13;
the IERR in relation to the calculated value (base case) if deviations occur in the major benefit and cost&#13;
components (travel time savings, operating cost savings, wages and salaries, general expenditures,&#13;
investment costs). Tables 9.8 and 9.14 summarize the results for both investments and show the&#13;
switching values (values that reduce the IERR below the 10 percent threshold):&#13;
Qualitative Analysis of the Infrastructure and Equipment Component&#13;
30.          Table 9.17 is an impact matrix which summarizes the impact of the proposed&#13;
investment on a number of aspects which could not be quantified in the standard benefit cost analysis.&#13;

very different, the network as a whole is highly dependent on external cash infusion for its operations.&#13;
Internally generated cash (from farebox revenues) has traditionally been able to cover a maximum 1 8&#13;
percent of the working costs. In 1994, the system had a working ratio of 5.62.&#13;
2.           Annual traffic volumes of about 5 million passengers on the South line are just 1 2&#13;
percent of the total traffic of the system and with very high operational cost. The small traffic volume&#13;
is mainly due to four reasons: (a) slow service; (b) low frequency; (c) lack of access to the center of&#13;
the city; and (d) insufficient integration with other modes especially with the Central line. A major&#13;
problem contributing to long headways is the large number of at-grade crossings where the road traffic&#13;
must be stopped to allow for the passage of the train. The resulting poor service has spurred a number&#13;
of parallel bus services which have been contributing to the general traffic congestion in the area.&#13;
3.           Low tariffs along with depressed demand and high evasion in the South line have&#13;
negatively affected the revenue generating capacity of STU-REC. Metro/train tariffs are usually set 10-&#13;
20 percent below the lowest bus tariff and the level of revenue sharing in the case of integrated travel&#13;
also short changes STU-REC because the bulk of the receipts are allocated to the bus companies.&#13;
Realistically, a combination of measures geared towards increasing demand and tariffs are needed to&#13;
enhance the internal cash generation capacity. Evasion, although high in the South line (21 percent)&#13;
is negligible for the whole network as most of the current demand (88 percent) comes from the Central&#13;
line. On the other hand, as the South line is electrified the evasion rate becomes more of a problem.&#13;
It is expected to go down to near zero because of less open access to the line (fencing the right-of-&#13;
way) and the stations. Demand is expected to increase due to the re-routing of buses to the system.&#13;
4.            On the cost side, drastic measures would be required to balance the costs with&#13;
revenues. In 1 994, personnel cost (salaries plus benefits) was four times the farebox revenue. The&#13;
South line which carried about 1 2 percent of all passengers accounted for about 20 percent of labor&#13;
cost; the rest was associated with the Central line. With 1,785 employees of which about 500 are in&#13;
administration, STU-REC is considered overstaffed.&#13;
5.           Financial Projections. With the proposed improvement and integration of the mass&#13;
transit network and the extension of the South line to the center of Recife in 2001, annual traffic is&#13;
expected to reach in excess of 102 million passengers-an increase of more than 250 percent over&#13;
1 994. A parallel increase in average tariff of about 75 percent would be needed to realize a working&#13;
ratio of 1.23 in 2001, a five-fold improvement over 1994. The increase in traffic is expected to result&#13;
from the construction of TIP-Timbi section of the Central line which is expected to bring in commuter&#13;
traffic. In the South line, extension of the system to the center, construction of integrated stations,&#13;
improvements in the infrastructure design that will eliminate at-grade crossings, and the fencing of the&#13;
right-of-way would allow increases in the frequency of train service as well as its access to the center.&#13;

6.           With increased and enhanced service, tariffs are expected to increase in order to better&#13;
represent the true economic value of the system and increase the availability of the internally generated&#13;
funds. The proposed increase in average tariff-from US$0.23 in 1994 to US$0.40 in 2001 - takes&#13;
into account the surrounding economic environment, and the financial forecast is based on tariff values&#13;
which are less than those charged in some of the other mass transit systems in Brazil. It also takes into&#13;
account passenger surveys in which they indicate that they are willing to pay more for better and more&#13;
frequent service. With more integrated stations, a greater increase in the number of transfer&#13;
passengers is expected. Farebox revenue from integrated passengers is expected to be nearly three&#13;
times that generated by non-integrated passengers.&#13;
7.           While the farebox revenues are expected to increase by 390 percent between 1 994-&#13;
2001, working costs are projected to increase by only 5 percent due largely to a 3 percent decrease&#13;
in the personnel costs because of the expected reduction in administrative staff. As the proposed&#13;
project includes major overhaul of the current system, maintenance requirements for the network&#13;
between 2001-2005 are expected to be marginally over that in the pre-project years. Because of a&#13;
higher rate of increase in internally generated revenue compared to the working costs, by 2001 STU-&#13;
REC should have enough revenues to cover 85 percent of its working costs. Annual subsidy&#13;
requirement is therefore expected to fall from US$39 million in 1 994 to US$3 million in 2001.&#13;
8.           Financial Forecast Assumptions. The financial forecast was prepared using March 1995&#13;
values. The forecast is based on the following major assumptions:&#13;
*     Between 1 994-2000 demand is expected to grow at 5 percent per annum. After the&#13;
start of the improved service in 2001, growth in demand is expected to slow down to&#13;
1 percent per year;&#13;
*     Tariffs are expected to increase in real terms during 1995-2005. Average tariff is&#13;
expected to increase by 75 percent between 1995-2001 and another 12.5 percent&#13;
between 2001-2005. Since average tariff is derived after discounting for promotional&#13;
and incentive tickets, integrated tickets, and multi-passes, the selling price of tickets&#13;
(face-value) may be different from the average tariff.&#13;
*     Students are expected to pay 65 percent of the value of the full fare ticket. The&#13;
remainder will be compensated to STU-REC by the government along with the&#13;
compensation for gratuitos based on the full face-value of one-way ticket;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                                ANNEX 10&#13;
*      Non-operational revenue is expected to be about 5 percent of the operational income&#13;
by 2001, and includes the income from selling advertisement space. These results are&#13;
similar to those observed in other rapid transit systems;&#13;
*      Salaries and benefits are expected to increase by 5 percent per year during the&#13;
projection period. The total personnel cost is, however, expected to decrease due to&#13;
a reduction in staff;&#13;
*      Energy cost is assumed to vary in direct proportion to car-km during the projection&#13;
period;&#13;
*      STU-REC's share of the integrated ticket is assumed to be 60 percent;&#13;
*      Spares and material cost is expected to be about 14 percent of the working costs.&#13;
*      The state would be responsible for the replacement of assets and thus no provision has&#13;
been made in the analysis for covering depreciation from operating revenues.&#13;
Nonetheless, in order to ensure that the funds for replacement of assets are timely&#13;
available, the financial forecast envisages creation of an escrow fund by directing non-&#13;
operational income to it.&#13;
-      STU-REC is not expected to have any liabilities as these will be assumed by the Federal&#13;
Government.&#13;
9.            Sensitivity Analysis. The financial forecast assumes a reduction in total personnel&#13;
expense of about 3 percent between 1 994-2001 due to a reduction in the administrative staff. A&#13;
failure to decrease the size of the labor force and restrict its further growth will negatively affect the&#13;
financial results. In the case that the assumed reductions in staff do not take place, the working ratio&#13;
would worsen to 1.19 and the system will require additional subsidies of US$27 million over the&#13;
projection period. On the other hand if the employment actually grows by 30 percent in 2001, the&#13;
working ratio will be 1.40 and the revenue cost coverage would decrease to 75 percent compared to&#13;
94 percent in the base case.&#13;
10.          Assuming that the working costs were underestimated in the forecast by 20 percent,&#13;
the resulting working ratio would be 1.34 and the revenue cost coverage would decrease to about 79&#13;
percent. The public treasury would, however, have to contribute another US$100 million in subsidies&#13;
between 1 996-2005 as the underestimation in costs is considered uniform over the projection period.&#13;
In order to mitigate the risk of cost underestimation, the project envisions contracting out of a number&#13;
of services to lower the operational costs.&#13;
11.          The projected financial performance would also be adversely affected if there were a&#13;
reduction in revenue due to: (a) low traffic volumes; (b) increased implementation period for the&#13;
project; and (c) low tariffs. Assuming that the actual traffic were 20 percent below the projected&#13;
volume, farebox revenues would fall and the resulting working ratio would be pushed up to 1.39. The&#13;
revenue coverage ratio would thus drop down to 75 percent. This loss in traffic is calculated to cost&#13;
the state about US$44 million during 2001-2005. On the other hand, if the loss in traffic is temporary&#13;
due to construction delays, the promised financial performance would simply shift by similar number&#13;
of years as the delay in starting the operations. It is estimated that each year delay in construction&#13;
would cost STU-REC about US$20 million.&#13;
1 2.   The loss in revenue due to STU-REC's inability to increase the average tariff is the most likely&#13;
risk that the project faces due to the political unpopularity of the measure. If the average tariff is forced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -                              ANNEX 10&#13;
to remain at its projected 1 996 level, STU-REC will have sufficient revenues only to cover 71 percent&#13;
of its working costs during 2001. In this case, the working ratio would increase to 1.49 and the&#13;
system would require an additional US$80 million in operating subsidies between 2001-2005.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RECIFE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE, MONITORING, EVALUATION&#13;
AND SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
A. Project Implementation Schedule&#13;
1.           The implementation schedule for individual components are shown in Annex 8. Those&#13;
schedules and the detailed cost tables of Annex 8 provide the basis for project monitoring and for the&#13;
disbursement profile.&#13;
2.           Implementation Monitoring. CBTU will monitor compliance with the individual&#13;
implementation schedules by defining target dates for key actions. The target dates for key actions for&#13;
the first two years of the project (to about mid-1 997) are shown in the Action Plan in this Annex. In&#13;
November of each year CBTU will prepare, with the agreement of the Bank, a similar action plan for&#13;
the following year of implementation, and so on throughout the life of the project. In the event of&#13;
delays, CBTU will be responsible for identification of the constraints and for devising and executing&#13;
policies to resolve problems.&#13;
3.           Financial progress will be monitored by CBTU in the same manner as implementation&#13;
progress. Estimates of the South line and Central line costs have been made but final costs will be&#13;
dependent on consultants' final engineering designs and on bid prices (for equipment etc.). Thus, it will&#13;
be the responsibility of CBTU to update cost schedules as contracts and bids are finalized, and to&#13;
monitor financial progress in relation to the updated schedules.&#13;
4.           CBTU will report on both implementation and financial progress in the biannual progress&#13;
reports.&#13;
5.           Evaluation of the South and Central lines of the project will attempt to determine the&#13;
extent to which original construction schedules and costs are respected.&#13;
B. Monitoring and Evaluation of Project Components&#13;
6.           Monitoring would identify the physical, institutional and financial status of each&#13;
subproject component, as appropriate, on a periodic basis. The aim would be to identify implementa-&#13;
tion problems and the extent of deviation from the targets proposed at appraisal. The results of the&#13;
monitoring program (the comparison of achieved performance with appraisal targets) will be prepared,&#13;
coordinated and presented by CBTU. The results of each subcomponent monitoring program will&#13;
provide the basis and information for implementing agencies to prepare measures and actions to&#13;
resolve implementation problems, if any, and at the same time, to update project costs, disbursement&#13;
and implementation schedules if necessary. Monitoring indicators to be employed will vary by type of&#13;
component but the general guidelines are set out in the following paragraphs.&#13;
7.           The general guidelines given below would be followed:&#13;
(a)    each implementing agency would prepare, as part of its component preparation&#13;
report, an implementation schedule which sets out target dates for key actions&#13;
for physical works, equipment supply and institutional components. Where&#13;
components are not fully prepared at appraisal, it would be a condition of their&#13;
subsequent inclusion that an implementation schedule be prepared as an&#13;
integral part of the component;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106-                                ANNEX 11&#13;
(b)   for physical works (and equipment) progress the implementation schedule will&#13;
define target dates (to the nearest quarter) for the start and finish of key&#13;
actions involved in the implementation of physical works (and supply of&#13;
equipment). Thus indicators are likely to include:&#13;
(i)    start/finish dates for final engineering design and documents for works&#13;
(or equipment);&#13;
(ii)   date of issue of bid documents;&#13;
(iii)   date of contract signature; and&#13;
(iv)   start/finish dates for works (or supply of equipment).&#13;
(c)   for financial performance since works (or supply of equipment) are likely to&#13;
extend over some time, the component implementation schedule will also be&#13;
required to give target "percentage completed" by quarter. Thus target&#13;
expenditures can be estimated and will be used to monitor financial&#13;
(disbursement) performance on a quarterly basis;&#13;
(d)   for institutional measures (technical assistance, training and studies), the&#13;
monitoring targets will be the progress reports and the dates of completion&#13;
indicated in the implementation plan of Annex 7; and&#13;
(e)    monitoring of resettlement and property values in the area of influence of the&#13;
STU-REC before, during and after construction.&#13;
8.           Ex-post evaluation would be aimed at determining the effectiveness and efficiency of&#13;
measures in meeting the objectives determined at appraisal. In the event that objectives are not met&#13;
and previously anticipated improvements in performance are not achieved, the data would be used:&#13;
(a) to identify why components had not been fully successful; and (b) to modify future components&#13;
proposed for subsequent implementation which were based on similar premises. Furthermore, the ex-&#13;
post evaluation would be used as a major input to the Project Implementation Report.&#13;
9.           Operating and financial performance targets have been established for STU-REC. They&#13;
are given below.&#13;

not later than 30 days after entry into operations of the link or stations; and (d) the results of a train&#13;
user survey, to be carried out every two years after effectiveness until project completion, to gauge&#13;
the satisfaction of the users with the level of service offered by the system. The above qualitative&#13;
monitoring indicators would be rated on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 5 (excellent).&#13;
C. Supervision Plan&#13;
11.          The main emphasis during the initial project phase would be to: (a) review the&#13;
development and implementation of the project monitoring system; (b) make certain that CBTU's staff&#13;
is familiar with Bank procurement guidelines, Bank disbursement procedures (i.e., Special Account&#13;
transactions), and Bank independent auditing requirements; (c) ensure that all steps towards&#13;
decentralization of STU-REC to the State are being taken; and (d) help CBTU/RTCC's development of&#13;
a strategy to properly promote the project to the RMR public. Many of these items would be addressed&#13;
in the first supervision mission scheduled for November 1995. During project implementation, the&#13;
supervision missions would need to conduct the following activities in the field on a regular basis in&#13;
addition to monitoring project progress: (a) review a sampling of contract bids and awards; (b) inspect&#13;
disbursement procedures and record-keeping; (c) inspect adequacy of supervision and monitoring of&#13;
the implementing agencies and respective subprojects; (d) review performance and accuracy of the&#13;
Project Monitoring System; and {e) complete a Mid-term Review 24 months after project effectiveness&#13;
to examine the progress made, especially in the Integrated Land Use, Urban Transport, and Air Quality&#13;
Strategy and policies to assess the relevance of project objectives and actions, and recommend&#13;
appropriate revisions (as needed). Supervision missions in the field should attempt to visit all the&#13;
agencies dealing with the project during each trip. A preliminary schedule of supervision missions&#13;
including key activities is indicated in the table on the following page. The key activities shown are in&#13;
addition to the regular supervision needs, which include a review of: (a) progress reports; (b)&#13;
procurement issues; (c) disbursements; (d) Project Implementation Plan; (e) project costs; (f) yearly&#13;
independent audits; (g) correspondence; and (h) unforeseen issues.&#13;
1 2.         The Bank project team  would consist of the Task Manager (Sr. Transport Plan-&#13;
ner/Economist), a Railway Engineer, a Metro Infrastructure Specialist, a Resettlement Specialist and&#13;
a Financial Analyst. Consultants are anticipated to be required on a short-term basis to assist in specific&#13;
areas, such as analysis of monitoring system, and review of institutional development programs.&#13;
Supervision requirements for the project are expected to be high due to: (a) the complexity of the&#13;
institutional arrangements; (b) the anticipated large number of small-scale subprojects; and (c) the&#13;
institutional weakness of CBTU (requiring significant training and technical assistance). Supervision&#13;
requirements are anticipated to be about 20 staff-weeks during the first year and about 1 2-1 5 staff-&#13;
weeks thereafter. A summary of key inputs is provided on the following page.&#13;
13.          Borrower's Contribution to Supervision. CBTU is expected to: Ca) be responsible for&#13;
project monitoring and coordination, to keep the Project Monitoring System accurate, and to follow-up&#13;
and address all issues which are "signaled" by the system; (b) be responsible for properly managing&#13;
all procurement and disbursement considerations, keeping procurement and disbursement records up&#13;
to date; (c) prepare progress reports in June and December of each year; and (d) be responsible for&#13;
coordinating arrangements for the Bank supervision missions.&#13;

            Brazil - Recife Metropolitan Transport
            Decentralization Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Recife Metropolitan Transport
            Decentralization Project will: (a) develop an integrated
            urban transport system from the Recife Metropolitan Region
            (RMR) under the existing regional transportation
            coordination commission, Metropolitan Urban Transport
            Company,(EMTU), established to coordinate and recommend
            common policies on pricing, regulation, financing, project
            evaluation and selection; (b) the decentralization of the
            Recife Subdivision of the Brazilian Urban Trains Company
            (STU-REC) subdivision from the federal to the state level;
            (c) the reduction of the negative environmental impacts on
            the RMR due to road-based vehicles and the promotion of
            non-motorized transport modes; and (d) the development of
            special strategies and actions to improve the accessibility
            of the poor to employment centers, health centers, and
            education facilities.
