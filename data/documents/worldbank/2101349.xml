Executive Summary&#13;
Access to water supply services in Vietnam, not to mention&#13;
sanitation services, is still rudimentary in small towns and&#13;
even more so in townlets and communes. According tow&#13;
the Ministry of Construction only 30 percent of small towns&#13;
have piped water systems. It is estimated that a mere 15&#13;
percent of the townlets have piped water systems. Most&#13;
piped water systems cover only a fraction of the                             III"&#13;
populations in small towns and townlets; it is estimated e77&#13;
that the connection rate ranges from 20 to 80 percent,&#13;
suggesting that only a very small part of the total     '&#13;
population in small towns and townlets is covered by&#13;
piped water systems.&#13;
It is not obvious from the research undertaken that any&#13;
one of the small towns water supply management models&#13;
is outperforming any of the others. Some management&#13;
models do better in some aspects than others, but this is&#13;
against the background of a sample that has flaws and&#13;
with a dataset that suffers from inconsistencies, especially&#13;
with regard to the financial data collected. What emerges&#13;
from  the data - with all these caveats - is a              _     i&#13;

1. Introduction&#13;
In recent years, developing countries have focused most            "f&#13;
of their new water supply and sanitation investments on L&#13;
either urban or rural areas. Small towns often fall between                                  M|&#13;
these two settlement types in many ways - institutionally,                                      - &#13;
financially, and legally. According to estimates from the  ,o &#13;
Ministry of Construction 30 percent of small towns have&#13;
piped water, and only 15 percent of townlets have access&#13;
to that service. In most areas, the piped water service&#13;
extends onlyto a fraction ofthe population living in small                   |&#13;
towns and townlets, making the actual access to services&#13;
significantly lower than these data reflect. In contrast,                         .5&#13;
access to safe water in urban areas is 61 percent. In&#13;
rural communities an estimated 30 percent of residents&#13;
have access to water that meets basic domestic&#13;
requirements but only about 10 percent have access to  community management. TheVietnam Small Towns case&#13;

Small towns do not completely fit within either the urban  In Vietnam, small towns are known as either small towns&#13;
or rural context. They are often considered too small to  (thi tran) or townlets (thi tu). Urban areas are classified&#13;

is estimated at about 19 million people (24 percent of             Vietnamese administrative levels&#13;
thetotal population). Small towns are classified as "class&#13;
5 urban areas". They comprise more than 5 million&#13;
inhabitants (or about 7 percent of the total population).&#13;
These "class 5 urban areas" are defined as settlements&#13;

II. Methodology&#13;
Vietnam is in a dynamic period of economic growth and&#13;
liberalization. Regulations are changing, and new&#13;
opportunities are opening (and others closing). That is&#13;
one reason why there is what on the surface appears to&#13;
be an odd mix of old and new management models.&#13;
Most of the new water supply systems are in management&#13;
arrangements that have only recently become possible&#13;
with changes in regulations and decentralization. For&#13;
example, the Enterprise Law made it possible for the&#13;
private sector to enter the market and compete against&#13;
state-owned enterprises (SOEs). That is one reason for&#13;
the experimentation bythe private sector in water supply,  i &#13;
and SOEs attempting to become more competitive.&#13;
The research team investigated the water supply and&#13;
sanitation situation in 22 small towns and townlets.&#13;
A variety of management models was looked into:&#13;
(i) direct management by Small Town People's               '1&#13;
Committee (STPC) in small towns and Commune                         4&#13;
People's Committee (CPC) in townlets;        .x &#13;
(6i) community management;&#13;
(iii ) cooperatives;&#13;
(iv) provincial water supply companies (PWSCs). This is&#13;

responsible for providing water supply services to      In the sample, small towns mostly resorted to PWSCs,&#13;
provincial capitals (Class IV towns), but recently have  other SOEs or private water companies, while in the&#13;
seen their mandate extended to also provide their        7 townlets (one of which is served by 3 water supply&#13;
services to small towns (Class V towns);                 systems4), the variation in management models is&#13;
(v) other state-owned enterprises. In the sample, they       substantially larger -with cooperatives, communities,&#13;
mainly consist of district water supply companies and/   private operators and STPC/CPC managing water&#13;
or environmental service companies; and                  supply systems.&#13;
(vi) private water companies.&#13;

In addition to these models, the research team identified          and their location within Vietnam&#13;
two other management models, which are much less&#13;
common. The first is management by the Provincial&#13;
Center for Rural Water Supply and Environment Sanitation&#13;

communes. Another model refers to the District People's                          -                Red Rver Delta&#13;

district administrative units such as the District Economic&#13;
Office, the Division of Public Works and Transport, or&#13;

district.          North Centrol&#13;

Initially five provinces were selected for the study: three&#13;
provinces in the Red River Delta (Nam Dinh, Thai Binh&#13;
and Ha Nam) and two provinces in the Mekong River                                                      Central&#13;

or communities were built in surrounding villages. In Le Loi, one of the townlets in the sample, the research team looked into three existing systems, two&#13;

lower than if the divergence was&#13;
positive.&#13;
5  In the case of community contributions, for example, there were a number of systems that registered a zero contribution All these observations were given&#13;
a similor rank, and hence instead of 22 being the highest ranking, the highest ranking would be lower, because of the shared ranking of a number of&#13;

average per capita investment cost is lower than $40. Figure  20             I&#13;

More interesting is the relationship between the investment&#13;
cost per capita and the different regions - when major    5         -&#13;
outliers are excluded. It is interesting to note that the outliers  X                .i.&#13;
are concentrated in the North Central Region and to a lesser  0  ,                'h&#13;

while the systems in the North almost all relied exclusively  Figure 3 Coverage and Access by Management Model&#13;

Coverage and Access to Water Supply Connections.       60%&#13;
Coverage and access have distinct meanings. Coverage&#13;
refers to those households that are connected to a piped&#13;
network, while access includes those households that&#13;
not necessarily are connected, but nevertheless use piped&#13;
water connections. In general, access exceeds coverage  40%&#13;
significantly in Vietnam due to the practice of sharing&#13;
connections.                                                             I&#13;
Coverage is relatively low in Vietnam. Only 38 percent  30%&#13;
of the population in the 22 small towns under review   20%&#13;
owns a piped water connection. Even in systems that&#13;
have been in existence for many years, coverage is far&#13;
from universal. Coverage differs substantially among the  l0%&#13;
different management models - with SOEs having the&#13;
highest coverage rates and community-managed systems    0%&#13;
showing the lowest coverage. However, access to piped       G         0  ' \&#13;
water is significantly higher; on average 51 percent of   1o Cยฐยฐ   C0&#13;
the population has access to services. For PWSCs, for&#13;
instance, sharing is very significant, with average&#13;
coverage being 37 percent, while access is no less than&#13;
60 percent.&#13;
6  The latter could not be verified due to lack of data on the inputs and cost of the maor cost items&#13;
7 In the North East Region, coverage is high at 67 percent, which is not the result of sharing that is not a common practice here However, this region is&#13;
characterized by a relative lack of alternative water sources.&#13;

V. Financial Performance&#13;
Financial performance was measured using three&#13;
proxies: (i) profit margin, (ii) government funding and                         JT&#13;
(iii) community contributions. Financial autonomy of&#13;
water supply stations in townlets and small towns is still&#13;
limited because water supply stations are not allowed  -&#13;
to set the water tariff. It was found that while provinces&#13;
control the water tariff in large urban areas; in small&#13;
towns, townlets and rural areas the tariff is mainly set&#13;
by the people's committees (STPC or CPC). The water&#13;
tariff of community-managed systems is usually set by&#13;
the community and endorsed by the People's&#13;
Committee.&#13;
Tariff Structures. National Urban Water Supply policy&#13;
states that tariffs overall should be adequate to cover&#13;
the full cost of water supply operation and maintenance,&#13;
but it is not enforced due to the political constraints.  block rate tariffs in some systems different tariff levels&#13;

between different management models. Block rates are     all management models (except for community-managed&#13;
especially common in PWSCs, and less so in privately     systems). The explanation for this may be improper&#13;
operated systems.                                        accounting that does not distinguish tariff income from&#13;

Figure 6 shows that the actual tariff levels vary between  may be insufficient "ringfencing", which is a specific form&#13;
the different management models, with SOEs charging      of imprecise accounting. Many PWSCs and/or SOEs are&#13;
the highest and community managed systems charging       allowed to conduct multiple businesses to increase the&#13;
the lowest rates, with the average at approximately      viability of the enterprise. Revenues from  these other&#13;
$0.1 3/im3. Additionally, significant differences in tariffs  activities, such as pipeline construction, or supplying water&#13;
exist between the North and the South, most notably&#13;
between the Red River Delta and the Mekong Delta. On     Figure 6  Tariff levels (US$/m3)&#13;
average, water tariffs in the Mekong Delta are twice as&#13;
high as those charged in the Red River Delta.               0.20&#13;
Profitability. Factors that influence the "profitability of&#13;
water supply systems", whereby profit margin is defined&#13;
as the difference between revenues and operating costs&#13;
and depreciation, are:&#13;
o Consumption: The higher the water consumption per&#13;
capita, the higher the "profits" assuming the tariff is   0.10_    *-&#13;
adequate. It is likely that the size'' of the system, in&#13;
terms of how     much water is consumed        and&#13;
subsequently paid for, explains a large part of the&#13;
difference between a "profitable" and "non-proftable"&#13;
water provider.&#13;
o Tariffs. The higher the water rates, the more likely it is&#13;
that a positive return is generated.                                 -l    -L&#13;
o Investment cost per capita: The higher the investment&#13;
per capita, the more unlikely that the profit margin is                       "'s ยฐ       0&lt;0 \&#13;
positive.                                                           o     o&#13;
10 A flat rate is defined as a single rate per cubic meter regardless of how much water is being used Block or progressive rates are using different rates for&#13;
different consumption levels Even though, many small towns and/or townlets use flat rates, they may have different rotes for different types of consumers&#13;
(for example, residentiol and commercial customers).&#13;

Upon prolect completion, PCERWASS hands the facility  multiple sources, such as private investors and&#13;
over to local authorities - DPC, STPC, CPC or   community have contributed to the investment capital,&#13;

Box 1 Ownership Who is in Charge2&#13;
In Nam Giang, 1,250 households have connections for which they contributed 375 million VND. At the some&#13;
time, all shareholders of the cooperative have drawn parts of their shares from the Cooperative, so the contribution&#13;
of the users and the CPC (representing the state fund aid) have become disproportionately larger but these&#13;
stakeholders are not considered as shareholders. Tien Giang Province has recognized this problem, and has&#13;
promulgated a regulation that does not allow state-owned and private water supply enterprises to mobilize&#13;
funds from customers/users for the construction of water supply facilities. In case funds have been mobilized,&#13;
they must be refunded. The legality and the regulation on the contribution by water users to the expansion&#13;
investments must be considered and guided more adequately, ensuring the customers' participation but also the&#13;
legality in terms of the rights of the water users and the owners of the facilities.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Box 2   Technical Design Options and their Impact on Financial Viability&#13;
The capacity and service level of townlet water supply systems are usually determined on the basis of the funds&#13;
which can be mobilized from the State, donors, community contributions or other sources. Because these funds&#13;
are usually in short supply, investment in water supply systems is usually done gradually, closely following&#13;
demand. Initially only a small well is drilled, a small pump is used. Once demand increases, additional investments&#13;
are made (drilling more wells, purchasing more pumps, expanding the pipeline network, etc.). Good examples&#13;
are: Tan Hoi Dong, Nhi Quy and Ben Luc which at present operate at around 70 to 80 percent of their design&#13;
capacity. This investment model allows making full use of plant capacity, avoiding the construction of excessively&#13;
large facilities, and reducing operation cost and depreciation, and thus helping to keep the cost of water down.&#13;
However, in the design of the pipe network the need for expansion in the future should betaken into consideration:&#13;
the main pipeline should be of sufficient diameter, the treatment station should be designed in modules which&#13;
can be easily integrated when expansion is needed.&#13;
On the other hand, some water supply systems have invested large sums compared to the ability of its inhabitants&#13;
to pay, so that the actual amount of water pumped is much lower than the capacity invested in. This case is&#13;
common where the principal investor is not also the manager and operator of the system, such as in Tu Ha,&#13;
where the DPC was the principal investor, constructing a water station with a capacity of 4,000 m3/day and a&#13;
cost of 18 billion VND to provide water to the two small towns of Sia and Tu Ha. Tu Ha operates on only less than&#13;
5 percent of its design capacity, just like Quang An. Other small towns and townlets like Vu Thu, Kien Khe, Que,&#13;
Trung Lao and Le Loi 1 also have systems which are seriously over-designed.&#13;

VilI. Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
Access to water supply services, not to mention sanitation  Figure 13 Overall performance by Management Model&#13;
services, is still rudimentary in small towns and even more&#13;
so in townlets and communes. In the study sample, about&#13;
38 percent of the population in these settlements owns house  140&#13;
connections, while a slightly higher number representing&#13;
45 percent of the population has access to water supply  120&#13;

            Vietnam : evolving management models for
            small towns water supply in a transitional economy
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Access to water supply services in
            Vietnam, not to mention sanitation services, is still
            rudimentary in small towns, even more so in townlets, and
            communes. Most of the piped water systems cover only a
            fraction of the populations in small towns, and it is
            estimated that connection rates range from twenty to eighty
            percent, suggesting only a very small part of the total
            population in small towns is covered by piped water systems.
            What emerges from the data collected to undertake this
            research, is a multidimensional picture, one that looks into
            different aspects of sustainability results, with different
            conclusions. Key discussion points address the issue of
            identifying the best practice management model for Vietnam,
            recognizing that due to the country's varied geography,
            demography, and its rapidly evolving economic policy and
            regulatory environment, the use of a variety of management
            models is optimal. The report however, adds that some rules,
            such as autonomy in managing the water supply business, and
            proper tariff levels are better indicators for success than
            are the management models per se. Not surprisingly, in this
            review, systems managed by communities, cooperatives, and
            private operators, have much higher scores, than systems
            managed under other models. Furthermore, the level of demand
            measured in terms of water sold, is consistently a better
            indicator than population size for determining success, but,
            connection costs are an obstacle for greater coverage of
            water supply systems, though cross-subsidies may be useful
            in benefiting the poor.
