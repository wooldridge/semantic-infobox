thus â&#128;&#156;what we earn, what we do, and even who          study shows a correlation between better working&#13;

needs most is â&#128;&#156;good jobs,â&#128;&#157; defined by a worker        at homeâ&#128;&#148;with spouses reporting that they now&#13;

    How Workers Describe Job Quality&#13;
&#13;
    Defining job quality is important but difficult because jobs have many different char-&#13;
    acteristics like pay and working conditions. This study aims to understand how work-&#13;
    ers themselves see the key characteristics that shape job quality. Our field research in&#13;
    four countries (Cambodia, Kenya, Lesotho, and Vietnam) finds that job quality means&#13;
    largely the same thing. Certain economic characteristics such as good pay and benefits&#13;
    are prominent in workersâ&#128;&#153; minds, but so too are social dimensions such as respectful&#13;
    relations with managers and supervisors and work-life balance (facilitated by having&#13;
    reasonable work hours).&#13;

    New Tool: Performance Improvement Consultative Committees (PICCs)&#13;
&#13;
    One of the innovations of the BW Program has been the formulation of Performance&#13;
    Improvement Consultative Committees (PICC). PICCs are groups made up of an equal&#13;
    number of both management and union/worker representatives who meet regularly to&#13;
    help resolve disputes within the factory and also try and improve performance of the&#13;
    factory in a collaborative way. In Lesotho, workers can raise their specific health and&#13;
    safety concerns through PICCs, which are heard by union and non-union worker repre-&#13;
    sentatives, management representatives, and an enterprise adviser from Better Work.&#13;
&#13;
    Success of PICCs:&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 The PICCs proved to be useful avenues in which to bring up problems, and to resolve&#13;
       them more effectively than previous mechanisms.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 The PICCs not only helped improve industrial relations, but also helped to strengthen&#13;
       trade unions overall.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 In the case of Vietnam, the success of the PICC model was such that it compelled the&#13;
       government to introduce a new labor code that obligated employers to conduct social&#13;
       dialogue in the workplace.&#13;

&amp;#12;Chapter 2: Apparel Workers&#13;
Highlights&#13;
       Demographic profile: Workers in the textile and apparel industry tend to be younger than&#13;
   L&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       those in other industries. The average age of textile workers is 26 in Cambodia and 30 in&#13;
       Vietnam. Most are female (about 80 percent in Cambodia and Vietnam). Contrary to the&#13;
       popular belief that these workers tend to be single, about 50 percent are married.&#13;
       The apparel industry provides job opportunities for young people, mostly women from rural&#13;
   L&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       areas. Although apparel wages are low by international standards, the sector offers wage&#13;
       premiums, which draw women and men from rural areas. High wages and good working&#13;
       conditions are two of the top reasons why workers in Cambodia choose apparel factory&#13;
       jobs. Data also show that a sizable number of women are supervisors in the apparel industry.&#13;
       Workers defined job quality: Across the four countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Cambodia, and&#13;
   L&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Vietnam) where field research was conducted, it was found that job quality means largely&#13;
       the same thing. Certain economic characteristics such as good pay and benefits are&#13;
       prominent in workersâ&#128;&#153; minds in addition to social considerations such as collegial rela-&#13;
       tions with managers and supervisors, clean and safe work environments, and reasonable&#13;
       working hours. Thus, many of the qualities that workers from our field research value can&#13;
       be achieved at little to no economic cost.&#13;
&#13;
The apparel industry is known for being labor         worldwide: making up roughly 80 percent of&#13;

    Box 2.1: Profile of Garment and Textile and Apparel Workers in Cambodia&#13;
    and Vietnam&#13;
&#13;
    Size: In Cambodia, about 7.9 percent of employed workers (aged between 15 and 64)&#13;
    worked in the textiles and apparel industry in 2012. The apparel sector was less signifi-&#13;
    cant in Vietnam, where about 3.5 percent of employed workers (aged between 15 and&#13;
    64) worked.&#13;
&#13;
    Location: In Phnom Penh, the capital and economic center of Cambodia, the textile and&#13;
    apparel industry provides a significant share of employment. About 15.2 percent of work-&#13;
    ers in Phnom Penh work in the industry, and 25.7 percent of jobs in the sector are located&#13;
    in Phnom Penh. In Vietnam, about 30.8 percent of the textile and apparel workers live in&#13;
    urban areas, while about 27.7 percent of the non-textile and apparel workers reside there.&#13;
&#13;
    Demographic profile: Textile and apparel factory workers in Cambodia and Vietnam are&#13;
    predominantly women (83 percent and 80 percent, respectively). Workers in the textile&#13;
    and apparel industry tend to be younger than those in other industries. In 2012, the aver-&#13;
    age age of the textile workers was about 26 years in Cambodia and 30 years in Vietnam,&#13;
    while that of non-textile and apparel workers was 35 years and 38.5 years, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
    Education: In Cambodia and Vietnam, only a small proportion of textile and apparel work-&#13;
    ers has received education beyond the secondary level, and its share is proportionately&#13;
    smaller than that of non-textile and apparel workers. At the same time, larger shares&#13;
    of the textile and apparel workers have completed primary education and received at&#13;
    least some lower-level secondary education, compared with the non-textile workers.&#13;
    This holds true for both countries.&#13;

&#13;
     Box 2.2: How is Job Quality Defined in the Literature?&#13;
&#13;
     Defining job quality is important but difficult because jobs have many different char-&#13;
     acteristics. The main way to measure job quality is through wages. Alternatively, job&#13;
     characteristics can be taken into account. Wage data are much easier to find than&#13;
     measurements of nonwage working conditions. The data for other aspects of working&#13;
     conditions (benefits, air quality, noise, unionization, among many others) are scarce and&#13;
     generally not comparable across countries. Yet, job quality can be measured by more&#13;
     than just money. It is also measured by nonmonetary elements attached to the job, such&#13;
     as social security coverage, job security, promotion opportunities, and the like.&#13;
&#13;
     From a theoretical perspective, the relationship between wages and nonwage working&#13;
     conditions can be positive or negative. Using wages as a measure of working conditions,&#13;
     however, poses potential problems if workers receive higher wages as compensation for&#13;
     working in poor conditions. This is certainly the case, even in developed countries, in&#13;
     dangerous industries, such as mining. Beginning with Adam Smith, economists have long&#13;
     theorized that workers who take jobs in less favorable conditions must be compensated&#13;
     with higher wages; this is commonly referred to as â&#128;&#156;compensating differentials.â&#128;&#157; This&#13;
     theory implies that workers in developing countries who accept jobs with less favorable&#13;
     working conditions earn higher than average wages. Surprisingly, empirical evidence on&#13;
     the compensating differentials hypothesis has been mixed.&#13;

Highlights&#13;
  á­¤ Better Work is an ILO-IFC joint initiative aimed at improving working conditions for apparel&#13;
     workers.&#13;
  á­¤ Better Work started in 2001 as Better Factories Cambodia, which grew out of terms stipu-&#13;
     lated in the U.S.-Cambodia Bilateral Textile Trade Agreement of 1999.&#13;
  á­¤ Better Work was intended to leverage key strengths of the main stakeholders in the apparel&#13;
     industry in an attempt to arrive at a beneficial outcome for all.&#13;
  á­¤ Better Work now operates in eight countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Haiti, Indonesia,&#13;
     Jordan, Lesotho, Nicaragua, and Vietnam) and reaches more than 1 million workers in more&#13;
     than 1,000 factories.&#13;
  á­¤ How Does the Better Work Program Work?&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Better Work addresses weak governance and low implementing capacities.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ The program goes beyond monitoring and offers added-value services that help build&#13;
       capacity and create more cooperative work environments.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ The program maintains cost effectiveness and promotes local ownership by employing&#13;
       mostly local staff to conduct factory assessments.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Transparency is a prominent feature of the program.&#13;

The Better Work (BW) program has its roots in                             the story of the evolution of the program using&#13;

     Box 3.1: HIV/AIDS in the Lesotho Garment Industry&#13;
&#13;
     HIV/AIDS is a serious problem in Lesotho, with a national prevalence rate of 23.2 percent,&#13;
     and the prevalence rate among garment workers estimated to be as high as 43.2 percent&#13;
     (ALAFA 2008). ALAFAâ&#128;&#148;the Apparel Lesotho Alliance to Fight Aids, an NGO in Lesotho,&#13;
     has provided HIV/AIDS testing for factory workers in addition to training on safe sexual&#13;
     practices and other activities to raise awareness. Apparel workers have been well aware&#13;
     of ALAFA and have benefited from the organization for years. ALAFA and BW have&#13;
     tried to coordinate efforts to address the issue of HIV/AIDS in the workplace. In 2013&#13;
     some apparel workers reported that there were some small adjustments in workplace&#13;
     practices, such as allowing short breaks for workers with HIV/AIDS who need to take&#13;
     their medications with food and water.&#13;
&#13;
     To further understand the extent of training and awareness around the issue of HIV/&#13;
     AIDS, apparel workers were asked whether their factories have an HIV/AIDS policy and&#13;
     whether there has been any awareness creation or training for workers related to the&#13;
     issue. Surprisingly, fewer people in 2013 than in 2011 report having an HIV/AIDS policy in&#13;
     their factories. However, more report that there has been some kind of awareness creation&#13;
     of HIV/AIDS. Though there is a decrease in the number of reported HIV/AIDS policies, a&#13;
     high number of factories still have such policies in place: 67 percent of non-BW factories&#13;
     compared to 85 percent of BW factories. Similarly, the amount of training/awareness&#13;
     creation related to HIV/AIDS for workers in non-BW factories is lower (80 percent) than&#13;
     for those in BW factories (90 percent).&#13;
&#13;
     ALAFA recently closed due to funding problems. While BWL (Better Work Lesotho) is&#13;
     unable to take on all of of ALAFAâ&#128;&#153;s tasks, they have incorporated some elements of safety&#13;
     and awareness regarding HIV/AIDS.&#13;

&#13;
    Tuoiâ&#128;&#153;s life drastically improved since she made the move from working as a coffee farmer in&#13;
    Dal Lac province in the Central Highland region of Vietnam where she was born, to working&#13;
    as a sewer in a garment factory just outside of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). Together with&#13;
    her husband, who works in construction, they have been able to save enough money to&#13;
    purchase their own house where they live with their two children and her mother-in-law.&#13;
&#13;
    Every morning, except for Sunday, Tuoi takes her six-year-old son to kindergarten at&#13;
    the factory where she works. The kindergarten is only one of several improvements that&#13;
    Tuoi mentioned when discussing how the Better Work program has helped to improve&#13;
    her quality of job and life. Other key improvements she identified included improved&#13;
    ventilation, better overtime allocation, and better safety procedures. She also spoke to&#13;
    the positive relationship she has with both her supervisors and colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
    In terms of the impact of her job on her life at home, Tuoi said, â&#128;&#156;Since I have been working&#13;
    here, we have a better life. We discuss what to do, what to spend, and also what school&#13;
    to send our children to.â&#128;&#157; She was also grateful for having a happy family, with a husband&#13;
    who supports her, including helping with household chores.&#13;
&#13;
    While Tuoi enjoys her job, she has ambitions to eventually open up her own tailor shop&#13;
    and wants to see her children continue their studies so that they can get jobs in finance&#13;
    or accounting. Commenting on her job and future plans, she said, â&#128;&#156;I really like this job. I&#13;
    really like the garment factory job. I plan to work here for a few years to save money to&#13;
    open a tailor shop of my own.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      are made to improve working conditions, they are rarely reversed; (2) reputation-sensitive&#13;
      buyers encourage the factories they source from to be in greater compliance with national&#13;
      and international labor standards. However, important issues still exist, and the BW Program&#13;
      has not proven to be a panacea for all of the garment sectorâ&#128;&#153;s problems.&#13;

     Box 4.1: Better Work Compliance Monitoring Methodology and Reporting&#13;
&#13;
     Better Work carries out factory assessments to monitor compliance with international&#13;
     labor standards and national labor laws. Assessments are based on a comprehensive&#13;
     set of questions (generally more than 200 in total) that cover core labor standards and&#13;
     national labor law. Information is gathered through a variety of sources and techniques,&#13;
     including document reviews, observations on the shop floor, and interviews with manag-&#13;
     ers, workers, and union representatives.&#13;
&#13;
     Better Work organizes reporting into eight areas, or clusters, of labor standards. Each&#13;
     of the eight clusters is divided into its key components. These components are known&#13;
     as compliance points (CPs), of which there are 38. Each CP contains specific questions&#13;
     that may vary from country to country. Four of the clusters are based on fundamen-&#13;
     tal rights at work regarding child labor, discrimination, forced labor, and freedom of&#13;
     association and collective bargaining. In 1998, member states, workers, and employer&#13;
     representatives at the International Labour Organization (ILO) identified fundamental&#13;
     principles and rights at work regarding these four issues based on eight widely ratified&#13;
     International Labor Conventions (29, 87, 98, 105, 100, 111, 138, and 182). These conven-&#13;
     tions provide the baseline for compliance with the fundamental rights clusters across&#13;
     all Better Work country programs. The four other clusters, which monitor compliance&#13;
     with standards primarily established by national law (and therefore vary from country to&#13;
     country) consist of compensation, contracts and human resources, occupational safety&#13;
     and health, and working time.&#13;
&#13;
     In its factory and industry-level reports, Better Work highlights noncompliance findings.&#13;
     It reports these figures to help factories easily identify areas in need of improvement.&#13;
     Better Work calculates noncompliance rates for each factory and reports the data in&#13;
     individual factory reports. The noncompliance rate is reported for each subcategory, or&#13;
     compliance point, within a cluster. A compliance point is reported to be noncompliant&#13;
     if even one question within it is found to be in noncompliance.&#13;
&#13;
     In public synthesis reports, Better Work calculates the average noncompliance rates for&#13;
     all participating factories in each subcategory. For example, an average noncompliance&#13;
     rate of 100 percent means that all participating factories were found to have violations&#13;
     in that area.&#13;

&#13;
    Box 4.2: Specific Categories of Compliance&#13;
&#13;
    To illustrate some of the differences across various categories, we focus here on four&#13;
    specific areas that are fairly comparable across countries, either because the questions&#13;
    used are fairly similar or because they cover similar aspects. The four comparable areas&#13;
    analyzed in this section are ambient conditions, safety, wage policies, and freedom of&#13;
    association and collective bargaining (FACB). Ambient conditions encompass air, tem-&#13;
    perature, water, and sanitation facilities in the factories. Safety covers machine safety&#13;
    and fire safety. Wage policies focus on three areas: contracts (e.g., whether contracts&#13;
    are in the native language, are written, and are understood by the workers), wages (e.g.,&#13;
    paid on time and correctly), and overtime (e.g., measured and paid correctly). The last&#13;
    category, FACB, includes questions about the freedom of workers to join a union, man-&#13;
    agement attempts to interfere with unions, the presence of collective bargaining, and&#13;
    whether the collective bargaining agreement is followed.&#13;
&#13;
    It is possible to analyze improvement in compliance over time using regression analysis.&#13;
    In particular, we estimate differences in compliance categories across countries by esti-&#13;
    mating a linear probability model. This regression estimates the effect of employment,&#13;
    share of female workers, visit number, time, and country on question-level compliance.&#13;
    The results are shown in Appendix A.1.&#13;
&#13;
    Several interesting results emerge. First, and perhaps not surprisingly, having a Better&#13;
    Work (or BFC) Program increases compliance, which is consistent with improvements&#13;
    being linked to Better Work. Furthermore, compliance is higher in larger firms (when size&#13;
    is measured by employment). A higher female share of employment is also associated&#13;
    with higher compliance.&#13;
&#13;
    Differences across the categories are statistically significant. Compliance with ambient&#13;
    standards, safety, and wage policies are lower than in other areas of compliance. Dif-&#13;
    ferences across countries are also evident. The results suggest that both Jordan and&#13;
    Vietnam have higher noncompliance rates than Cambodia, which is again consistent&#13;
    with the idea that time in Better Work or BFC is associated with increasing compliance.&#13;
    The main message from these results is that the definition of â&#128;&#156;sweatshopâ&#128;&#157; varies across&#13;
    countries in the sense that different problems arise in different countries. In this regard,&#13;
    allowing for country-specific flexibility to deal with different problems is a strength of&#13;
    the Better Work Program.&#13;

    Box 4.3: What Do Our 2015 Data Tell Us about the BFC Program in Terms&#13;
    of Compliance?&#13;
&#13;
    The 2015 Cambodia Apparel Workers Survey confirms earlier findings on the impact&#13;
    of BFC on working conditions. Appendix Table A.5 summarizes our survey data from&#13;
    Cambodia in terms of assessing workersâ&#128;&#153; perceptions of compliance. It shows that more&#13;
    than half of workers received OSH training, and almost all workers report that their&#13;
    factories have a health and safety committee. Slightly fewer workers, however, report&#13;
    having a health and safety policy. In terms of contracts, 71 percent of respondents have&#13;
    a fixed-term contract, 80 percent have had their contract explained to them, and 88 per-&#13;
    cent have signed a contract. Although the relative percentage of men and women who&#13;
    have fixed-term contracts is similar, a higher percentage of female workers have signed&#13;
    contracts and have had their contracts explained to them. When workers were asked&#13;
    â&#128;&#156;how often were you asked to work overtime when you did not want to over the past&#13;
    three months?â&#128;&#157; about two-thirds reported that it had never occurred. Still respondents&#13;
    reported working long hours, on average about 58 hours per week. The working hours&#13;
    do not differ across factory category. On a positive note, workers almost universally (over&#13;
    90 percent) reported that they received leave whenever they asked for it.&#13;
&#13;
    Awareness of the existence of the BFC Program is low among workers. Only about&#13;
    36 percent of workers have heard of the BFC Program, and both male and female work-&#13;
    ers appear to be equally aware or unaware of the program. Across types of factories,&#13;
    as expected, workers in factories in service category C, who receive a full package of&#13;
    services from BFC (assessment, advisory, and training), are most aware of the BFC.&#13;
&#13;
    Among workers who know BFC, workers in factories that receive some services from&#13;
    BFC (category B and C) reported that their working conditions had improved more than&#13;
    those of their peers in factories that only receive assessment services. Among workers&#13;
    who said that there have been improvements in their factories, most identify the most&#13;
    significant area of improvement in terms of safer and healthier workplaces. Again, work-&#13;
    ers in category A factories have not experienced this improvement to the same extent.&#13;
    Despite high rates of satisfaction with OSH, womenâ&#128;&#153;s satisfaction with OSH is consider-&#13;
    ably less than that of male workers (85 percent compared to 95 percent).&#13;

     â&#128;¢	 Better Work Vietnam has seen that factories with performance improvement consul-&#13;
        tative committees (PICCs) are much more likely to attempt negotiation before strikes&#13;
        occur. As a result, the number of strikes in Better Work factories is significantly lower&#13;
        than the industry average.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 According to the 2012 Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL) study, the&#13;
        PICCs not only helped improve industrial relations, but also helped to strengthen&#13;
        trade unions overall.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 The model of PICCs in Vietnam has had such a profound impact on the country that&#13;
        it has inspired a change in the labor law. In 2013 a groundbreaking change was made&#13;
        in the Vietnamese labor law, which now calls for worker/management committees in&#13;
        all enterprises to serve as a mechanism for social dialogue.&#13;

Phamâ&#128;&#153;s story&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              Age: 35&#13;
                                 Years working in garment sector: 17&#13;
&#13;
After graduating from high school, Pham worked in his hometown in the Nong Son Dis-&#13;
trict of Quang Nam Province of Vietnam as a construction worker apprentice for three&#13;
months, but it was not the career he wanted. His parents also urged him to learn a skill&#13;
that could help him get a better job and Pham ended up taking the initiative to learn&#13;
sewing from a local tailor. He then worked for that shop for three months before moving&#13;
to Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) to start working in a garment factory. His sister had moved&#13;
to HCMC a year earlier and had warned Pham about the difficulties of the job and city&#13;
life, yet Pham still chose to come because he did not see much of a future for himself&#13;
back home, where he probably would have worked as a construction worker if he had&#13;
not pursued a career in the garment industry.&#13;
&#13;
Since moving to HCMC, Pham has since worked in four different factories, and has been&#13;
with his current factory for more than 10 years now. He is very happy at his current fac-&#13;
tory, where he works as a technical worker and is a PICC member. Pham recalled his&#13;
first day at work:&#13;
&#13;
My first impression on my first day of work was seeing the general director having lunch&#13;
together with workers. I also saw the general director roll up his sleeves and help workers&#13;
move/load/unload goods so I feel at home and have a strong attachment to my factory.&#13;
&#13;
The training that Pham received from Better Work (BW) in workplace communication&#13;
also proved to be of value at home. Pham is now able to better communicate with his&#13;
wife. While he would get upset in the past, he reported that now he calms down and&#13;
speaks to her in a gentle tone to resolve any problems they may have.&#13;
&#13;
Pham also offered an interesting suggestion for a possible future area for training given&#13;
that so many workers like him migrate from rural areas. He recommends that the factory&#13;
provide practical programs for workers, such as life skills and knowledge/experience&#13;
regarding city life so that workers can gain confidence and more quickly integrate into&#13;
their new lives and contribute to their factories.&#13;
Phamâ&#128;&#153;s wife is also working in the garment industry. Together they have been able to save enough money to&#13;
buy a house in HCMC. So he sees their future there, and despite the difficulties of life away from his parents,&#13;
he reports that the schools in HCMC are better for his children. Phamâ&#128;&#153;s dream is to continue working in the&#13;
garment factory and earning money, which he plans to send to his parents, spend on his childrenâ&#128;&#153;s education,&#13;
and use to eventually open his own tailor shop in HCMC.&#13;

      The benefits of the Better Work (BW) program go beyond factory compliance and working&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
      conditions. Workers also feel improvements in their lives at home and in their communities.&#13;
      Working in the garment industry is associated with a better quality of life for workersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
  L&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      families. In addition, field work in 2013 in Lesotho revealed that learning how to budget&#13;
      better was one of the most common improvements that workers talked about. Using 2011&#13;
      data from Cambodia, we find that having a mother working in the apparel sector makes&#13;
      girls 6.5 percent more likely to attend school.&#13;
      Both quantitative results (in Cambodia) and qualitative findings (in Vietnam, Cambodia,&#13;
  L&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      and Lesotho) confirm that women and men receive equal pay for equal work. The use of&#13;
      productivity targets and piece-rate remunerations also help explain the wage equality.&#13;
      Apparel jobs help women gain more equality in their families. Working in urban areas, in&#13;
  L&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      the formal sector, and in fast-paced and demanding work in the garment industry could act&#13;
      as an agent of change in breaking old norms, like women bearing the burden of household&#13;
      chores. In addition, Cambodia data suggest a correlation between the length of exposure&#13;
      to the garment industry and the likelihood that households will switch to joint decision-&#13;
      making. The data also reveal that communication skills learned through BW has been key&#13;
      in changing parochial norms, as improved communication skills allows women to negotiate&#13;
      a new balance inside theirs home and society.&#13;

Working in the garment industry impacts work-           when dealing with male factory managers and&#13;
ersâ&#128;&#153; lives beyond factory walls. Workers benefit        employers may intensify. The fact that women&#13;
from interventions of the Better Work program           tend to be concentrated in lower-paying garment&#13;
not only through improvements in their working          jobs further challenges the notion that women&#13;

    Box 5.1: The Value of Communication Skills Training&#13;
&#13;
    The results from the Lesotho survey suggest that benefits from communication skills&#13;
    training can often be substantial, so it is useful to consider that the value of Better Work&#13;
    (BW) training activities may not be fully captured by synthesis reports, which focus on&#13;
    compliance points. Here is an example:&#13;
&#13;
        â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;ve learned more about communication [from Better Work]. If I have an issue with&#13;
        my husband, I should prepare myself to sit down and discuss in a calm manner and&#13;
        I should not shout at him. It is the same as at work because I always prepare myself.&#13;
        For example, I should know what Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to talk about, with whom Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to have&#13;
        the discussion, and that weâ&#128;&#153;re going to discuss a certain issue and Iâ&#128;&#153;m prepared for it.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

    Even if only anecdotal, the experience described above is encouraging. While our cod-&#13;
    ing of focus group discussions (FGDs) in Lesotho does allow for an analysis that goes&#13;
    beyond anecdotal findings, we still need to capture more systematically the impacts of&#13;
    programs such as Better Work beyond factory walls.&#13;

&#13;
     Box 5.2:â&#128;&#130;Poverty Measurement of Apparel Workers in Cambodia&#13;
&#13;
     Usually, the poverty rate is measured at the household level since the standard poverty&#13;
     estimation method relies on comparing the level of household consumption with appro-&#13;
     priate poverty lines. Therefore, poverty rates shown in this report are actually the poverty&#13;
     level of the households that workers are living in at the moment.&#13;
&#13;
     How can the poverty of workers from the 2015 workers survey be compared with the&#13;
     national poverty line?&#13;
&#13;
     Generally, poverty analysis is carried out by using a national household survey with an&#13;
     extensive module on household consumption like the CSES. However, there is a consid-&#13;
     erable challenge in collecting direct income or consumption data upon which to assess&#13;
     poverty levels. Asking income or consumption questions in a household survey can be&#13;
     extremely time-consuming and vulnerable to error (due to dependency on recall, lengthy&#13;
     modules, etc.). This has been the main reason preventing researchers from studying pov-&#13;
     erty situations and well-being of a small and specific group of population like garment&#13;
     workers in factories in the Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) program.&#13;
&#13;
     To overcome the challenge on data availability, this report employs the Survey of Well-&#13;
     being via Instant and Frequent Tracking (SWIFT) method, which entails collecting a hand-&#13;
     ful of strongly predictive poverty correlates, such as household size, ownership of assets&#13;
     or employment conditions, and then converts them to poverty statistics using rigorous&#13;
     estimation models. Collecting correlates is a far easier task and can be accomplished&#13;
     more quickly than collecting income or consumption data (World Bank, forthcoming).&#13;
     The projection model (see appendix F for estimation methodology and results) was&#13;
     combined with key data collected from the workers survey. Data collected from the&#13;
     workers survey include data about assets owned by each workerâ&#128;&#153;s household, such as&#13;
     motorcycles, TVs, washing machines, etc., in addition to demographic data, such as the&#13;
     number of people in the household.&#13;

                                        Age: 37&#13;
                           Years working in garment sector: 12&#13;
&#13;
Coming from Koro, a rural town in Lesotho, Pinda dropped out of school to work as a&#13;
babysitter to help support her family. After her mother disappeared when Pinda was&#13;
only 8, she went to live with her grandmother and her sisters. After some time, Pinda&#13;
realized that her income was not enough to sustain their livelihood and thus made the&#13;
move to work in a garment factory when she was 25 years old. Even today Pinda still&#13;
has to support a large family including two of her sisters, her children, and her husband&#13;
(who works but in the agricultural sector). Pinda vividly remembers that Better Work&#13;
first started operating in their factory in 2012. During her interview with us, she described&#13;
three of the benefits of the Better Work program in detail.&#13;
&#13;
OSH training benefit: greater safety and preparedness&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;After Better Work came to my factory, things really changed. Because I didnâ&#128;&#153;t understand&#13;
how firefighters, health and safety, and smoking houses work. We now have things like&#13;
this. Exit line. Evacuation plan. First aid kits. Things have changed.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Benefit of being a PICC member: confidence&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Since Better Work came to my factory, I have been one of the members of PICC [per-&#13;
formance improvement consultative committees] in my factory. I feel comfortable and&#13;
confident because the one thing I can feel, the one is important is that we have a meeting&#13;
with the factory manager, with the management and discuss some problems. And we can&#13;
see what we achieve.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;After becoming a PICC member, really they can see they come to me and ask me many&#13;
questions and I can tell me. And I teach them some many things. Really I feel so confi-&#13;
dent. Really.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Budget training benefits: better budgeting&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;I appreciate Better Work because I didnâ&#128;&#153;t understand how to manage my salary. I was&#13;
the one who attend the workshop with Better Work. They gave us some training about&#13;
budgeting and really I realize how to manage my salary. Even if it is small, I have to man-&#13;
age it. I have to sit down and see how things are going.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

     Box 6.1: A Race to the Top: Greater Productivity and Improved Worker Welfare&#13;
&#13;
     Asuyama et al. (2013) delve deeper into the post-MFA (Multi-Fibre Arrangement) period,&#13;
     studying changes in performance of Cambodia garment firms between 2002/03 and&#13;
     2008/09. They cite improved average total-factor productivity (TFP) as a key reason for&#13;
     how the Cambodian garment industry managed to increase its production and profits in&#13;
     the face of increased competition. They then ask if this was achieved by sacrificing the&#13;
     welfare of workers, especially low-skilled workers. The answer is emphatically no. In fact,&#13;
     they identify an improvement in workersâ&#128;&#153; welfare, including a rise in the relative wages&#13;
     of the lower-skilled workers. â&#128;&#156;These industrial dynamics differ considerably from those&#13;
     indicated by the â&#128;&#152;race to the bottomâ&#128;&#153; argument as applied to labor-intensive industrializa-&#13;
     tion in low-income countries.â&#128;&#157; Beresford (2009) similarly finds no evidence of a decline&#13;
     in labor standards as competition increased post-MFA.&#13;

concerns make more than 7 percent more profits.        question is especially salient among economists&#13;

inputs. Imported intermediate inputs help control              producers, such increases in exports would be&#13;
for country-specific trends as well as national                extremely unlikely as exports would probably&#13;

gravity results when imported intermediate inputs              suggest the opposite: Consequently, BW may be&#13;

previous results. In particular, the results suggest           the effects are larger when the importing country&#13;

    Diepâ&#128;&#153;s Story&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               Age: 40&#13;
&#13;
                                Years working in garment sector: 17&#13;
&#13;
    As the HR, Admin, and Compliance Manager for a factory in Vietnam with over 2,500&#13;
    employees, Diep has her hands full. But she loves her job and has gradually worked her&#13;
    way up the ranks, spending a total of 17 years at one factory, something that is not very&#13;
    common in the apparel industry. She has been in her current position for over 7 years&#13;
    and has seen many improvements in that time. Diep spoke to several specific benefits&#13;
    that she attributed to the presence of the Better Work program in her factory.&#13;
&#13;
    First, the creation of the PICC (performance improvement consultative committees) has&#13;
    enabled the factory to better resolve in-house problems. For example, the PICC realized&#13;
    that workers were having a high number of accidents when operating the button-punching&#13;
    machine. They then devised a plan to address it, which included monitoring of the work&#13;
    stations to ensure that a proper safety protocol was followed in addition to having work-&#13;
    ers who had accidents on this specific machine to join the supervisory team and help&#13;
    convince other workers of the importance of following the safety protocol. Diep happily&#13;
    reported that ever since the introduction of the PICC initiative, the number of accidents&#13;
    to button-punching machine operators has fallen substantially.&#13;
&#13;
    Second, Diep spoke about the benefits provided by BW trainings. They received train-&#13;
    ings in workplace cooperation, professional safety, and organizational skills. She reported&#13;
    three concrete positive outcomes as a result of the trainings: (1) an improved collective&#13;
    bargaining process, (2) reinforced use of personal protective equipment (PPE) among&#13;
    workers, and (3) improved dialogue between workers and factory management.&#13;
&#13;
    Finally, Diep also linked the improvements brought about by the BW program to higher&#13;
    productivity. In her own words: â&#128;&#156;Thanks to Better Work Program, we have a better work-&#13;
    ing environment. The workers are happier and are more committed to the factory. And&#13;
    then we have significantly reduced our turnover. Thanks to the Better Work Program,&#13;
    weâ&#128;&#153;ve increased our productivity. Also, the products are much improved, and we have&#13;
    more clients.â&#128;&#157; From 2000 to 2013, the factory where Diep works more than tripled its&#13;
    sales, reaching US$90 million last year. And her factoryâ&#128;&#153;s monthly output is now roughly&#13;
    1.1 million pieces.&#13;

Kenya: An Ideal Candidate for Better Work?&#13;
&#13;
To examine possible gains from implementing a program such as BW, we conducted a&#13;
case study of Kenya, a country in Africa with a sizable garment sector. The field research&#13;
focuses on workersâ&#128;&#153; perspective; thus, it is not meant to be taken as a policy recommen-&#13;
dation that BW should be established in Kenya. For us to make that conclusion, other&#13;
criteria would need to be evaluated, which includes, but is not limited to governmental&#13;
laws, regulation and support, brand interest, and donor funding. The following discus-&#13;
sion therefore offers a brief overview of the Kenya apparel sector before identifying key&#13;
issues raised by the Kenya apparel workers through focus group discussions (FGDs). A&#13;
program such as Better Work seems to be well positioned to address many of the con-&#13;
cerns regarding job quality that the workers expressed.&#13;
&#13;
MastametÂ­  -Masona and OgemboÂ­   -Kachienga (2012) identify the historically important role&#13;
played by the Kenya apparel industry in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic development. Ever since&#13;
gaining independence in 1963, the country has relied greatly on manufacturing output&#13;
and textile and apparel production in particular. The textile and apparel sector developed&#13;
rapidly and employed about 30 percent of the labor force in the national manufactur-&#13;
ing sector in the mid-2000s. Currently, approximately 170 apparel companies operate&#13;
in Kenya. Of these companies, approximately 16 companies are operating in the Export&#13;
Processing Zone (EPZ) and employ an estimated 24,000 workers producing garments&#13;
for export. Yet, the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness has been seriously hampered by the loss of&#13;
global markets following the elimination of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) quotas&#13;
regime at the end of 2004. Moreover, Kenya is also facing stiff competition from Asian&#13;
countries that can produce apparel products at lower costs However, like many other&#13;
countries in Africa, Kenya has benefited from duty-free access to the U.S. apparel market&#13;
under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). In addition to political support&#13;
by the Kenyan government, buyers also suggest that African countries such as Kenya&#13;
are well positioned to grow their apparel sectors (Manson 2014).&#13;
&#13;
The following section highlights the main complaints voiced by workers and details how&#13;
a program such as Better Work could help to address these concerns.&#13;
&#13;
Long Working Hours without Pay.â&#128;&#130;Several workers said they are working overtime&#13;
without pay. Moreover, many workers spoke about the impact that working long hours has&#13;
on their home life. The majority of female workers said working long hours is angering/&#13;
frustrating their husbands, who only tolerate it for a few nights and then leave them.&#13;
Others said they are short tempered with their children. Overtime is a BW compliance&#13;
point and thus this problem could at least be identified, and possibly rectified through&#13;
BW assessments. The link between work and home-life satisfaction is also evident in this&#13;
particular complaint. Our review has shown that improving work conditions can indeed&#13;
have positive spillover effects on the quality of life outside factory walls.&#13;
&#13;
Health and Safety Issues.â&#128;&#130;Basic health and safety measures, such as distribution&#13;
of personal protective equipment, appears to be lacking, or, at best, inconsistent. This&#13;
reflects a shortcoming with respect to occupational health and safety policy, which can&#13;
be identified, and possibly then rectified, through BW assessments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     (continued)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Kenya: Continued&#13;
&#13;
    Poor Relations with Supervisors.â&#128;&#130;Workers talked about supervisors using harsh&#13;
    language an generally poor relations between workers and supervisors. BW supervisor&#13;
    trainings on communication could be conducted to equip supervisors with the necessary&#13;
    skills needed to better interact with workers.&#13;
&#13;
    Barriers in Joining Unions.â&#128;&#130;Some reported that their bosses discouraged them from&#13;
    joining a union (or that they were flat out denied the right to join a union). And if they&#13;
    did join, they felt they were discriminated against. This problem would fall under the BW&#13;
    freedom to associate compliance point.&#13;
&#13;
    Lack of Adequate Dispute Resolution Process.â&#128;&#130;If they have a grievance, workers&#13;
    do not take it to a dispute resolution body/organization. Instead, they take their griev-&#13;
    ances to their shop stewards. Many workers reported that they feel their grievances go&#13;
    nowhere. The performance improvement consultative committee (PICC) model that has&#13;
    proven so valuable is a clear solution here to help ensure that workersâ&#128;&#153; concerns are&#13;
    adequately heard and addressed.&#13;
&#13;
    Favoritism along Tribal Lines.â&#128;&#130;There is favoritism based on tribalism concerning hir-&#13;
    ing, allowing leave, giving overtime hours if workers want them, etc. This issue would be&#13;
    captured in the discrimination compliance point during BW assessment.&#13;
&#13;
    Many of the problems raised could be addressed through a program like BW. Moreover,&#13;
    despite all the complaints the workers voiced, many said they appreciate having a job,&#13;
    despite poor job quality, because it means they can at least put food on the table.&#13;
    Because their working conditions are far from ideal, this reality reinforces the importance&#13;
    of programs such as BW that aim to improve working conditions in garment factories.&#13;

Figure 8.1:â&#128;&#130;Summary of Key Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The Better Work program is an innovative approach to improving&#13;
            working conditions in apparel factories.&#13;
&#13;
                The e ects of the BW program on factory conditions are strong&#13;
                and positive.&#13;
&#13;
                   Evidence indicates that the beneï¬&#129;ts of BW extend beyond&#13;
                   factory walls.&#13;
&#13;
                   Evidence suggests that better working conditions are linked to&#13;
                   higher productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 To expand beneï¬&#129;ts, proactive interventions are needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Other countries can greatly beneï¬&#129;t from the introduction of the&#13;
           BW program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     across countries. Significant improvements           Nevertheless, more research is needed to&#13;
     have been made in occupational health and            explore the causality between better work-&#13;
     safety. The relationship between workers             ing conditions and better firm performance.&#13;
     and management has also improved with             5.	 To expand benefits, proactive interventions&#13;
     the support of performance improvement                are needed. At present, impacts are restricted&#13;
     consultative committees (PICCs). These gains          to active participant factories, but the effect&#13;
     are also sustainable, as shown by studies in          of the BW program on factories that are not&#13;
     Cambodia. However, Better Work is not a               subscribed to it are unclear. In this regard,&#13;
     panacea; challenges still remain.                     proactive interventions have the potential&#13;
  3.	 Evidence indicates that the benefits of BW           to harness spillover effects.&#13;
      extend beyond factory walls. Data point          6.	 The introduction of BW to other countries&#13;

      improvements include, but are not limited            where BW programs are currently in place&#13;
      to: a more equitable division of housework           could greatly benefit from the introduction&#13;
      between spouses, less stress given more              of BW program. Introducing BW to other&#13;

    To administer the questionnaire, one session was         In 2011 union organizers recruited participants for&#13;
held with roughly 60 workers at a hostel auditorium          focus group discussions (FGD), which was somewhat&#13;
in Maseru in May 2011, and a second session was held         a limitation of the study in that there was no nonunion&#13;

in Maputsoe in December 2011. Union organizers               for the focus groups were recruited in two ways: union&#13;
were responsible for recruiting the participants. With       members were recruited by their union organizers, and&#13;
everyone seated at a desk or table, my translator and        nonunion members were recruited by Better Work&#13;
I worked through the questionnaire with everyone,            Enterprise Advisors, who had nonunion contacts&#13;

shop stewards on how to facilitate the questionnaire,        and 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. Maputsoe is 80km north of&#13;

that workers might pose to them. These shop stewards         be more dangerous than Maseru. Workers in Maputsoe&#13;

gave them more time and flexibility to distribute and        took them longer to get to the meetings, which could&#13;
collect a larger number of questionnaires. Ultimately,       then begin only by around 6:00 p.m. This situation is&#13;

    As pointed out by a representative from the Ministry of Labor, it is a myth&#13;
    that milk will help those working with chemicals. The government has been&#13;
    working to try to discourage workers from believing in this. A representative&#13;
    from BWL also remarked that they do trainings on chemical management&#13;
    and that they are emphasizing that providing milk will not help them in any&#13;
    way.&#13;
