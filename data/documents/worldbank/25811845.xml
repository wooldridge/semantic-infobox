            The Lake Chad development and climate
            resilience action plan
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Lake Chad Climate resilience action
            plan outlines the concept that there is a need to turn Lake
            Chad into a rural hub for regional development in parallel
            to the restoration of peace and security. The Plan intends
            to contribute significantly to food security, employment,
            and the social inclusion of the youth by improving, in a
            sustainable way, the living conditions of populations
            settled on the Lake’s banks and islands as well as the
            resilience of a system characterized by a strong demographic
            growth, high hydrological variability, and climate
            uncertainty. To achieve it, the Action Plan proposes actions
            in seven Priority Themes based on observations and knowledge
            currently available. The four riparian States plus the
            Central African Republic and Libya, local powers (local
            governments or customary authorities), Lake Chad Basin
            Commission (LCBC), and the civil society will be responsible
            for implementing the proposed actions. The Plan includes
            enhancing the capacity of LCBC in terms of data collection,
            sharing of information, and carrying out analyses useful to
            governance of the basin`s shared natural resources. The
            success of this Plan requires continuing on-going efforts to
            strengthen the LCBC. The tentatively estimated cost of the
            Lake Chad Action Plan is about 916 million Euros.
