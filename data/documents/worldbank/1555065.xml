INVESTMENT IN INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH:&#13;
SOME ECONOMIC DIMENSIONS&#13;
This paper addresses two closely related issues. It first examines,&#13;
ex post, the socio-economic impact of agricultural research, particularly&#13;
that carried out by the international centers. It notes that the high-&#13;
yielding variety (HYV) cereal production technologies introduced in the&#13;
mid-1960s significantly increased the total supply of basic foods and&#13;
resulted in lower real food prices than would have been the case without&#13;
such technologies. Major beneficiaries therefore have been low income&#13;
consumer groups. The paper points out that widely-adopted agricultural,&#13;
technologies will at best leave relative income distribution unchanged among&#13;
producers, but will widen absolute income disparities when productive assets&#13;
are inequitably distributed. Although such technologies may increase the&#13;
demand for rural labor, and therefore produce some income gains for the&#13;
landless, the introduction of new technology is in general not an effective&#13;
means to redistribute incomes among rural groups.&#13;
The paper then addresses, ex ante, the "optimal" level of international&#13;
investment in agricultural research. This is done using a conceptual frame-&#13;
work to capture some of the more salient features of investment in research,&#13;
using a research production function, supply and demand curves for research-&#13;
generated agricultural production and discounted cash flow analysis. The&#13;
model, though tentative, suggests that international investments in crop&#13;
research could be significantly expanded from present levels without pushing&#13;
the economic rate of return to unattractive levels.&#13;

SUMMARY&#13;
i.        This paper addresses two closely related economic aspects of&#13;
agricultural research. First, it examines ex post, the impact of agri-&#13;
cultural research, particularly that carried out by the international&#13;
agricultural research centers, on several socio-economic variables including&#13;
output growth, income distribution, employment and nutrition. Second, using&#13;
a preliminary model it makes an assessment of the economically-optimal&#13;
investment in international agricultural research. The paper also includes&#13;
a 529-item bibliography of various reports and studies relating to the&#13;
extent, limitations and consequences of investment in agricultural research.&#13;
Impact of Investment in Agricultural Research&#13;
ii.       A major impetus to expanding international investment in food crop&#13;
research came in 1971 with the establishment of the Consultative Group for&#13;
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Subsequent years have seen a&#13;
remarkable growth in the number of donors to the CGIAR, the size of its&#13;
budget and the number of constituent institutions. The budget for 1979 of&#13;
nearly US$100 million comes from a wide variety of bilateral and multilateral&#13;
sources and will support a research program which embraces all major food&#13;
crops and livestock in developing countries which account for more than 70%&#13;
of the world's population.&#13;
iii.      This rapid growth in national and international research expenditure&#13;
has heightened interest among economic policy makers and research planners in&#13;
the overall effects of such investments. A wide range of carefully-conducted&#13;
studies demonstrate that in both developed and developing countries economic&#13;
returns to research are frequently in excess of 50% per annum and rarely fall&#13;
below 20%. But most of these represent only one dimension of social account-&#13;
ing, vis., economic efficiency. In the past decade it has been increasingly&#13;
recognized that the efficiency criterion must be supplemented by explicit&#13;
attention to distributional effects in assessing the impact of agricultural&#13;
research. These concerns mark the work of the international agricultural&#13;
research centers as well. Both in their mandates and the structure of their&#13;
research programs, these centers have recognized the need to address both&#13;
the efficiency and equity goals.&#13;
iv.       Research expenditure in developing countries, while still low&#13;
relative to that in developed countries, grew by nearly 600% in 1951-74.&#13;
Some of this expenditure resulted in the development and introduction of&#13;
high-yielding fertilizer-responsive varieties (HYVs) of wheat and rice&#13;
after 1965. Twelve years later (1976-77) over one-third of the total area&#13;
under these crops in Asia, Africa and Latin America was planted to these&#13;
varieties. On average, an additional 4.5 million ha have been planted to&#13;
high-yielding wheat and rice each year since 1965-66. This is expected to&#13;
slow as the land areas suitable to these technologies are depleted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-ii-&#13;
vo        Several studies suggest that HYV yields of wheat have on average been&#13;
about 100% greater than (ioeo, double) yields of varieties they replacecld A&#13;
similar comparison for rice suggests an HYV yield superiority of about 40%O&#13;
Estimates of this type are complicated by the inherent complementarities of&#13;
the HYVs with other inputs such as fertilizer and water. But it is clear&#13;
that the introduction of HYV wheat and rice has accelerated average annual&#13;
growth in production of these two crops (to 4% and 2.4%, respectively, in&#13;
1967-75, compared with 2.4% and 0.9% in the early 1960s) in the developing&#13;
market economics (DMEs)o   But almost all of this acceleration occured in&#13;
Asia. Elsewhere the rate of growth of rice and wheat output declined or&#13;
remained unchanged. At the same time, rate of growth of coarse grain produc-&#13;
tion declined in all DMEs.&#13;
vio       Returns to investment at the international centers has been higho&#13;
Roughly estimated, the economic rate of return to rice research through 1977&#13;
by IRRI was about 80%o This is roughly similar to the return to rice research&#13;
in Colombia by CIAT and national programso Continued investment in wheat and&#13;
rice research at the international centers is likely to be highly profitable&#13;
even under pessimistic scenarios regarding adoption and technology decay0&#13;
Several international centers have not yet been operating sufficiently long&#13;
to have had perceptible impacts on production.&#13;
viio      Because most HYVs perform well in favorably-endowed agricultural&#13;
areas with good water control, but poorly elsewhere, their introduction has&#13;
greatly exacerbated interregional income disparities0 Data for India suggest&#13;
that HYV production gains have been largely confined to the northwestern&#13;
wheat states, with some progress in isolated rice areas0 Areas dominated&#13;
by other cereals and dryland agriculture have made little headway0 Interstate&#13;
disparities in the growth of Indian agricultural productivity are also&#13;
explained by differences in research investment at the state level0&#13;
viii0     Most discussions of technical change in agriculture have addressed&#13;
the question of influence of farm size and tenure on adoption of HYVs0&#13;
Evidence from a broad range of studies suggests that in areas to which HYVs&#13;
are suited neither farm size nor tenure has been a major impediment to&#13;
adoption of these varieties0 In these areas the large farmers tend to be the&#13;
earlier adapters of the new technology, frequently because of lower risk&#13;
aversion, easier access to credit and knowledge of these varieties. Small or&#13;
tenant farmers have typically lagged in their adaption, but after this initial&#13;
period few if any differences remain in adoption rates across farm sizes.&#13;
ixo       Any meaningful analysis of the impact of the HYVs on income&#13;
distribution must disaggregate the question into several separate issues:&#13;
(1) the distributional impact among producers in a given region; (2) dis-&#13;
tribution between landholders and labor; (3) distribution between reg:Lons;&#13;
and (4) distribution between producers and consumers0 Because large farmers&#13;
are generally the first to adopt cost-reducing technologies, they capture&#13;
many of the early gains to producers0 This results in a temporary worsening&#13;
of the relative income distribution which is corrected as adoption by small&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-iii-&#13;
farmers catches up. However, while the relative distribution of income bet-&#13;
ween small and large farmers may eventually be unaltered, absolute income&#13;
differences will widen as a result of the existing inequality in the distri-&#13;
bution of productive assets.&#13;
x.        Less is known of the distributional consequences of technical&#13;
change between owner-operators and tenants and between landholders and&#13;
laborers. Some evidence suggests that the spread of HYVs has been contem-&#13;
poraneous with a decline in the area under tenancy and an increase in the&#13;
gross product paid as rent. The influence of relative factor prices confounds&#13;
the analysis of the impact of the HYVs on incomes of landholders and&#13;
laborers. But typically returns to landholders tend to rise more than returns&#13;
to labor, the supply of which is more responsive to higher prices. Absolute&#13;
returns to both landholders and labor increase but relative income disparities&#13;
widen to the advantage of landholders. In general, investment in productivity-&#13;
enhancing research is not an effective means to alter the relative distribution&#13;
of incomes between landholders and landless laborers. The principal impact&#13;
on employment lies in off-farm employment.&#13;
xi.       The distributional impact of the HYVs as between producers and&#13;
consumers depends on which groups are the predominant consumers of these&#13;
products and the manner in which demand responds to changes to price. Where&#13;
demand is not very responsive, as in the case of many HYV cereals, increased&#13;
supplies push prices lower and consumers capture the largest economic gains.&#13;
And because low income consumers spend a higher proportion of their total&#13;
income on food, they gain the most from price-reducing production technolo-&#13;
gies. Nutritional effects of the HYVs tend to be favorable on balance. Work&#13;
at ICRISAT suggests that the higher cereal production which ensues generally&#13;
results in a greater production of protein and calories than would otherwise&#13;
have been the case, even if it is assumed that some of this production occurs&#13;
on lands previously planted to high-protein pulses.&#13;
Preliminary Model of Optional Investment in Agricultural Research&#13;
xii.      This section of the paper describes a simulation model to address&#13;
the question of the optimal level of international investment in agricultural&#13;
research in the DMEs. The model is disaggregated into three components:&#13;
(1) a research production function; (2) a supply and demand analysis; and&#13;
(3) a discounted cash flow analysis. In the research production function&#13;
the percentage growth rate of agricultural output in these countries is a&#13;
function of the ratio of investment in research to the value of agricultural&#13;
output. The supply/demand analysis relates to commodities, expressed in&#13;
tons of wheat equivalent, included in the research portfolio (excluding&#13;
livestock) of the international agricultural research centers. Under parti-&#13;
cular assumptions regarding shifts in demand from population and income&#13;
growth and supply shifts from investment in agricultural research, social&#13;
benefits from this investment are estimated. The cash flow analysis combines&#13;
the flows of benefits and costs and generates the internal rate of return&#13;
from investment in international research.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
xiiio     The model was run, using "imost likely" values for the variables,&#13;
to estimate the alternative levels of investment which would result in rates&#13;
of return of 10%, 15% and 20%o The resulting values (1976 US$) of&#13;
$179 million, $75 million and $26 million respectively, can be compared actual&#13;
expenditure by the international centers on crop research in 1976 of about&#13;
$45 million. Alternative simulations explore the effects of different values&#13;
of key variables on the size of investments consistent with the above xates&#13;
of return. Even with relatively pessimistic assumptions regarding the&#13;
relationship between growth of agricultural output and research investment,&#13;
the investment level corresponding to a 10% return did not fall below&#13;
$125 million0 Rates of return were moderately sensitive to assumptions&#13;
regarding the time lag between availability and adoption of a technology, a&#13;
finding which highlights the importance of the technology diffusion process.&#13;
The overall results of this analysis, which should be viewed as a prel,minary&#13;
attempt at quantification of these relationships, supports the general view&#13;
that expenditure on crop research could be significantly expanded without&#13;
depressing rates of return to unacceptably low levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.01      The narrow focus of maximizing the growth of GNP that characterized&#13;
much of the post-war thinking and policies related to economic development&#13;
has been substantially altered since the mid-sixties. More recent views&#13;
encompass multiple goals, and often explicitly address the distributional&#13;
consequences of alternative economic development strategies. An important&#13;
aspect of these evolving views concerns the role of the agricultural sector.&#13;
1.02      Until the sixties, industrialization formed the cornerstone of&#13;
economic development policy in much of the developing world. Western coun-&#13;
tries were seen to have generated an increasing proportion of their economic&#13;
activity in the industrial sector, with a simultaneous decline in the impor-&#13;
tance of their agricultures. In an attempt to mimic the experience of the&#13;
developed economies, nations embarked on a deliberate policy of industrial-&#13;
ization. An expanding industrial base was seen as a route to rapid economic&#13;
growth, and to the absorption of apparent surplus labor in the agricultural&#13;
sector. To achieve their development goals, policies were established which&#13;
favored industrial expansion, often at the expense of the agricultural sector,&#13;
frequently denying the relevance of comparative advantage. In both market&#13;
oriented and centrally planned economies, heavy infusions of capital were&#13;
made in the industrial sector. While some of this investment was met from&#13;
public and private capital inflows, much was needed from internal sources.&#13;
As the agricultural sector was the predominant sector of the economy, it&#13;
became obligatory that resources be transferred from agriculture - in fact,&#13;
the agricultural sector became viewed as a reservoir of resources from which&#13;
could be extracted the flows of labor, capital and foodstuffs needed to&#13;
sustain non-farm economic growth.&#13;
1.03      Many and varied policy instruments were, and continue to be em-&#13;
ployed in pursuit of this transfer. Taxes on agricultural exports, land&#13;
taxes, cheap food policies, multiple exchange rates and protective indus-&#13;
trial tariffs represent only a sampling of the devices used to capture the&#13;
surplus of agriculture and use it as a stimulus to industrial growth.&#13;
1.04      In large measure this strategy failed.   It did not induce broadly&#13;
based, pluristic economic growth. Instead a small, highly capital intensive&#13;
industrial sector emerged, depending for its existence on direct and indirect&#13;
subsidies and employing little of the expanding labor force. The additional&#13;
income streams were largely captured by an urban elite whose expenditure&#13;
patterns did little to stimulate demand-induced linkages to the remainder of&#13;
the economy. Agricultural productivity tended to stagnate, lending credence&#13;
to the view that the sector was tradition-bound and unresponsive to prices.&#13;
1.05      An obvious question arises:   was the failure due to faulty concep-&#13;
tion of the process of economic growth or rather to a missing element? The&#13;
paradigm itself seems plausible. Sustained economic growth from time im-&#13;
memorial has been typified by a declining importance of the agricultural&#13;
sector. And rapid increases in real income per capita in Western economies&#13;
have occurred contemporaneously with a rise in the importance of the indus-&#13;
trial sector. However, in every case, technological change in agriculture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
has been a mainspring of economic growth0   From the introduction of irrigated&#13;
culture some 8,000 years ago, the use of a wJooden plough (3,500 noC.), to&#13;
the changing farming practices in Europe in the eighteenth century, to the&#13;
mechanical and chemical revolutions of the txfentienth century, agricultural&#13;
innovation has been the mechanism whereby the Drcduction of food could be&#13;
accomplished with a simultaneous release of capital and labor for non-&#13;
agricultural pursuits. So that in an economy where agricultural output: and&#13;
productivity are growing through investment and t.echaological ir-rovation,&#13;
the resource transfers originally envisaged in the growth policies of many&#13;
nations do, in fact, become a reality.&#13;
1.06      In the absence of technological change, discrimination against the&#13;
agricultural sector will lead to stagnation of food production and increasing&#13;
pressure on food prices, the latter augmented by population growth rates of 3&#13;
percent and greatero This has frequently led to governmental efforts to hold&#13;
down urban food prices, reinforcing the disincentive to invest in the agri-&#13;
cultural sector. In brief, a development strategy that does not incorporate&#13;
technical change in the agricultural sector is unlikely to lead to sustainable&#13;
economic growtho Rather than merely a pool of surplus resources which can&#13;
be taxed to support non-farm growth, agriculture is increasingly seen as a&#13;
primary, and crucial, sector in initiating and sustaining economic grouth.&#13;
1.07      A significant share of the responsibility for generating techno-&#13;
logical change in agriculture lies in the public domaino For certain phases&#13;
of innovation, individual producers could neither finance nor capture the&#13;
benefits of investment in research. Rowever, establi'shing in principle that&#13;
agricultural innovation is often an essential element of economic growth&#13;
leads only to the justification of social investment in research, given the&#13;
public nature of the product. It provides no guidelines as to the nature&#13;
or magnitude of that investment.&#13;
1008      Public investment in agricultural research is directed through&#13;
local, regional, national and international institutionso The major concern&#13;
of this paper is with the international componento During the last fifteen&#13;
years an increasingly systematic pattern of international investment in&#13;
research has evolved0 Section II of this paper provides some basic data and&#13;
information on the nature and scope of this investment, and highlights some&#13;
of the economic and social issues which surround it0&#13;
109      While a complex accounting of all the physical, economic, social&#13;
and political dimensions of this investment must await future analysis, the&#13;
impact on productivity in rice and Wheat production has been markedo Section&#13;
III presents an overview of some selected economic dimensions associal:ed&#13;
with the spread of modern, high yielding, cereal technology. This review&#13;
was undertaken in the hope that insights gleaned from past experience might&#13;
contribute to making choices about the nature and magnitude of future invest-&#13;
ment. The final section is devoted to an analysis of the optimal leveal of&#13;
investment in international agricultural research0 A classified biblLography&#13;

II. BACKGROUND&#13;
2.01      International investment in agricultural research dates from at&#13;
least the colonial era. Scientific efforts funded from the home country were&#13;
directed to improving the productivity of colonial plantation agriculture,&#13;
principally for those tropical crops prominent in the imports of the temperate&#13;
zone colonial powers. Rubber, tea, sugarcane and bananas are illustrative&#13;
of this phase. In the post-war period, some important investments were made&#13;
by private foundations in food crop research, but a turning point came in 1971&#13;
with the establishment of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural&#13;
Research (CGIAR). 1/&#13;
2.02      The formation of the CGIAR represented a marked change in the&#13;
philosophy toward investment in agricultural research. Firstly, it epit-&#13;
omized the growing recognition of the importance of the hitherto neglected&#13;
agricultural sector in the process of economic development. Second, it&#13;
sought to address research to domestic food crops, correcting the imbalance&#13;
with research on export crops inherited from the colonial era. And finally,&#13;
in the face of political realities, it sought to enhance multilateral funding&#13;
of research.&#13;
2.03      The formation of the CGIAR was in part stimulated by the early&#13;
successes of the two first generation international agricultural research&#13;
centers (IARC's): the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the&#13;
Philippines and the Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo&#13;
(CIMMYT) in Mexico. Both these centers had been created under the sponsor-&#13;
ship of private U.S. foundations.&#13;
2.04      Since its inception in 1971, CGIAR has become an important element&#13;
in the funding and direction of research aimed at enhancing food supplies&#13;
in the developing world. The initial years have been characterized by a&#13;
remarkable growth in the number of donors, the size of the system's budget&#13;
and the number of constituent institutions. 1/ In Figure 1 the annual core&#13;
and capital expenses of the system are shown for the period 1960-1980.&#13;
During this period over two-thirds of a billion dollars (constant 1977 U.S.&#13;
dollars) has been invested. The budget for 1979 is almost US$100 million,&#13;

donor institutions. More important, through its growth in breadth and com-&#13;

-5-&#13;
budget of the CGIAR is only about 3 percent of global annual research invest-&#13;
ment, and is less than that of Japan where only 6 million hectares are under&#13;
cultivation.&#13;
2.05      As recommended in the 1977 Report of the Review Committee, the&#13;
Consultative Group is now entering a period of maturation and consolidation.&#13;
Even the most expansive course of growth envisaged by the Review Committee&#13;
for the years 1976 to 1981 implied an annual rate of growth of only 7.3&#13;
percent in real terms. This represents a marked reduction from the annual&#13;
average real rate of growth of 17.5 percent that characterized the period&#13;
1971 to 1976. Given the ubiquitous nature of resource scarcity, including&#13;
resources for investment in research, attention is being increasingly focused&#13;
on achieving maximum returns to the investment of resources for which exists&#13;
a wide range of competing claims. As the growth phase ends, both the Con-&#13;
sultative Group and the individual centers will face difficult allocation&#13;
decisions, which will demand both more specific statements of the objectives&#13;
of investment in research, and closer attention to the selection of efficient&#13;
strategies for their fulfillment. Concern about the return generated by&#13;
investment in agricultural research, while being fully justifiable, is at the&#13;
same time somewhat ironic. A wide range of competently conducted studies&#13;
have documented that, in both developed and developing countries, programs&#13;
of investment in research have not uncommonly generated annual rates of&#13;
return in excess of 50 percent; rates as low as 20 percent are unusual. While&#13;
failures are not unknown, there are probably few investment opportunities&#13;
to which national or international funds could be dedicated which would so&#13;
consistently yield returns of this magnitude.&#13;
2.06      Rates of return constitute an appropriate and readily comprehended&#13;
index of the social profitability of investment in research. When calculated&#13;
for historical periods they answer the question: did the investment of scarce&#13;
public funds generate a return greater than that which would have accompanied&#13;
an alternative use of the resources? With appropriate assumptions, a similar&#13;
approach can yield estimates of the potential return to planned investment.&#13;
2.07      While analyses of aggregate costs and benefits, appropriately dis-&#13;
counted to reflect the lengthy lags involved, provide an encouraging back-a-&#13;
ground against which to foster the continued support of the international&#13;
agricultural research enterprise, they represent only one dimension of so-&#13;
cial accounting: that of economic efficiency. While it can be argued that&#13;
economic efficiency is a valid criterion against which to measure the social&#13;

profitability of the use of scarce             if- has become evident that it&#13;
is not a universally sufficient yardst iCck, c:. pezas2ps even a necessary goal.&#13;
Throughout this decade, explicit concern fo. wserlfa;e of the lower income&#13;
groups has become an important and recitrring ichete  n dliscussions of economic&#13;
development and the role of the internztiona! lending and donor community.&#13;
The international centers have been seeking to ertlculate their goals and&#13;
philosophy to reflect this concern. Both in their mandates and the structure&#13;
of their research programs evidence is found of the perceived need for&#13;
technological change to address both efficiency and equity goals. The more&#13;
traditional production-oriented philosophy has come under increasing pzessure&#13;
to place greater importance on the geographic and social distributional&#13;
implications of technological progress in agriculture. More recently, the&#13;
issue of food security has been added to the agenda of goals to which agri-&#13;
cultural research might be addressed. The search for so-called "scale--neutral"&#13;
technologies (or even technology biased for certain classes of producers),&#13;
and the notion that there exists a "gtrade-off" bet~ween achieving maximum&#13;
gains in agricultural productivity and real income gains for specified groups&#13;
have permeated the discussions of investment in research to generate tech°&#13;
nological change.&#13;
2008      It should perhaps be stressed that the very impetus for the forma-&#13;
tion of the CGIAR was "'to encourage more research to assist developing nations&#13;
increase the quantity and improve the qualfty of their agricultural output&#13;
and thus raise living standards." [22, po 281. That the system has chosen to&#13;
direct its support to research on the basic food czops and livestock which&#13;
comprise the diet of the majority of the population in the tropical zones&#13;
carries, in and of itself, a strong implicit statement of the contribution of&#13;
technological change to real income grow^th oF the poorest. Food expenditures&#13;
comprise such a large proportion of the total outlays of the lower income&#13;
groups that it is virtually axiomatic that strategies aimed at lowering the&#13;
real cost of foodstuffs will confer a disproportionate benefit on these&#13;
groupso However, the force and simplicity of this argument is threatened as&#13;
soon as recognition is given to the existence of low income producers as well&#13;
as consumers, to the inequality in the ownership of productive resources, and&#13;
to apparent imperfections in input markets,, which can result in unequal access&#13;
to the bounty of technological change0 That distributional consequences can&#13;
impinge on the strategy of increased food production is vividly illustrated&#13;
by Hopper's recounting of the attempts in 1966 to bar the introductioni of&#13;
high-yielding varieties to Indiao 1/&#13;
2.09      In the context of the CGIAR, it is evident (and indeed a stated&#13;
objective) that a continuing review of the priorities and research networks&#13;
related to the needs of developing countries is receiving, and will continue&#13;
to demand the group's most critical attention, in order to enable it to&#13;

adjust its support policies to changing needs. When there exists a single&#13;
dimensional goal of increased output through the enhancement of agricultural&#13;
productivity, the determination of priorities and research strategies is, at&#13;
least conceptually, a relatively straightforward matter. This assertion in&#13;
no way diminishes the complexity of the task, when problems of determining the&#13;
probabilities of success and the likely lags involved are duly recognized.&#13;
What is evident, however, is that when research is viewed as an instrument for&#13;
achieving broader social objectives, the problem of the selection of appro-&#13;
priate strategies and weighting of competing ends becomes vastly more diffi-&#13;
cult. Further, there can never exist a statement of objectives and priorities&#13;
which in any sense would be immutable. The very nature of technological&#13;
change is that it disturbs existing productive and economic relationships -&#13;
that it might not do so, would in essence constitute an admission of its&#13;
failure.&#13;
2.10      A clear understanding of the goals of research is a prerequisite&#13;
not only for the allocation of research resources, but for any evaluation&#13;
(ex post or ex ante) of the impact of the research. One cannot begin to&#13;
consider the impact until an answer is provided to the fundamental question:&#13;
"the impact of what upon what?" Is it the impact of research on expanding&#13;
the set of technologically feasible alternatives? Is it the impact of that&#13;
new technology on enhanced agricultural output and productivity? Is it in&#13;
turn the impact of greater productivity on economic growth? Is it the impact&#13;
of research through improved productivity and economic growth on human wel-&#13;
fare? And is welfare to be judged in terms of the distributional impact on&#13;
incomes of producers and consumers, as well as (or in place of) aggregate&#13;
real income growth?&#13;
2.11      The same set of questions can of course be posed in relation to&#13;
evaluating the past impact of the Centers. For simplicity, however, one&#13;
might argue that in that exercise, it is merely the consequences of the&#13;
technology that are being evaluated, with no explicit statement of the past&#13;
goals. But by the mere examination of the consequences it becomes difficult&#13;
to divorce the analysis from implicit judgments about what the nature of the&#13;
impact should have been. For example, if it is the case that the real wages&#13;
of agricultural labor did not increase in regions experiencing rapid techno-&#13;
logical change, this can be viewed as a simple statement of the consequences.&#13;
But there exists an inherent risk that some will view the welfare of the&#13;
landless as a goal, and hasten to stress the failure of the introduction of&#13;
new varieties to augment their incomes. The mere phrase "green revolution"&#13;
is perhaps an unfortunate label for what in essence has been a limited number&#13;
of new varieties of rice and wheat with enhanced capacity to utilize water&#13;
and fertilizer. Agronomic and social sciences have come to place very&#13;
new technology, generated by the investment in research, to the expectation&#13;
that it represents a mainspring of balanced and equitable agricultural growth&#13;
within the complex process of total economic development - in short an&#13;
instrument with which to ameliorate social ills - constitutes a major leap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
2.12      This in no way diminishes the fact that research which leads to new&#13;
production parameters does have economic and social implications. In fact,&#13;
as noted, technical change in agriculture has historically been a, if not the&#13;
predominant force in the growth of real incomeso Without advancements i.n the&#13;
productivity of agriculture, resources can never be released from fulfilling&#13;
the fundamental requirements of food and clothing. The assertion is simply&#13;
that a better understanding of the linkages between technology, improvecl&#13;
productivity, economic growth and ultimately human welfare is a prerequisite&#13;
for establishing realistic expectations, and hence goals, for the contrLbu-&#13;
tion of research0 As soon as one ventures beyond the confines of a single&#13;
objective such as "increasing rice yields" or "increasing the output of cas-&#13;
sava," and adopts a mandate which includes "accelerating agricultural economic&#13;
development" or "improve the diets and welfare especially of producers and&#13;
consumers with limited resources," then an understanding is required of the&#13;
mechanisms whereby research, whose immediate product is simply new agricul-&#13;
tural technology, can have an impact on these goals. Once the linkages are&#13;
understood, the constraints can be identified, and for a specified set of&#13;
priorities, the most efficient research strategy can be selected0 For&#13;
example, if an objective is to increase the caloric intake of the lower&#13;
income strata, we can only begin to select an appropriate research strategy&#13;
if we understand how the product of the research will influence the stated&#13;
objectives0 Should our objectives also include raising the real incomes of&#13;
small producers of calorie-intensive commodities, then we have the added&#13;
complication that alternative research strategies may (and generally, most&#13;
surely will) have differential impacts on the two objectives0 To overcome&#13;
this we need a set of weights which reflect the relative importance to be&#13;
attached to each of the objectives and permits the formation of a single&#13;
index or criterion against which alternative strategies can be evaluated0&#13;
2.13      The CGIAR has reached a consensus on the importance of generating&#13;
new technology for a range of basic foodstuffs, and has continually sought&#13;
out those areas of the research process whose communality suggests they are&#13;
amenable to international supporto With the mounting concern for investing&#13;
in research which might fulfill more specific distributional objectives,&#13;
the Group has both the obligation and the challenge to provide a forum for&#13;
discussion and exchange of information among members to enhance the articula-&#13;
tion of the ultimate goals of research0   In all likelihood, the Centers will&#13;
be subject to continued questioning about the distributional consequences of&#13;
their research strategies0 In the absence of a more focused debate, this&#13;
matter could well confound efforts to achieve the efficient use of the limited&#13;
resources allocated to research.&#13;
2q14      In an effort to contribute to this debate the present report&#13;
focuses on a review of the impact of technological change in agriculture,&#13;
with specific reference to the contribution of the Centers0 It is felt that&#13;
by an examination of the past impact, some insights can be gained as to&#13;
the contribution of research to enhanced productivity, and to its economic&#13;
consequences0&#13;

III. IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE&#13;
CONTRIBUTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS&#13;
A. Output Growth&#13;
3.01      Agricultural innovation, through a process of trial and error by&#13;
producers, has proceeded since the very inception of man's attempts at delib-&#13;
erate livestock and crop cultivation. But the modernization of agriculture&#13;
through organized research is little more than a century old, and the most&#13;
rapid increases in output have been in the last forty years. During this&#13;
time grain yields in the industrial countries have more than doubled.&#13;
However, although yields in 1934-38 were identical in the industrial and&#13;
developing countries (1.1 tons per hectare), by 1973-75 grain yields in the&#13;
developing countries had only increased to 1.5 tons compared with 3.0 tons&#13;
in the industrialized countries [495]. In 1907-09 rice yields in Thailand&#13;
were 1.9 tons/ha while in 1926-27 Philippine rice yields were 1.2 tons/ha.&#13;
In 1962-64 Thailand's yields were 1.5 and in the Philippines the national&#13;
average yield was 1.3 tons/ha. In 1901-05 India's grain yields were 296&#13;
kg/ha; in 1961-63 they were 305 kg/ha.&#13;
3.02      While this striking difference in the gains in agricultural pro-&#13;
ductivity is due to the complex interaction of many social, ecological and&#13;
economic elements, it can at least in part be attributed to investments in&#13;
research. The developing countries have invested a very much smaller percen-&#13;
tage of the value of their agricultural output in research. In 1951 Asia,&#13;
Africa and Latin America invested less than 0.5 percent in contrast to North&#13;
America and Oceania where 1.23 percent of the value of output was invested.&#13;
However, by 1974 the proportions were about 1.5 percent and 2.7 percent&#13;
respectively. Total research investment grew by nearly 600 percent in the&#13;
developing world between 1951 to 1974, and from 18 percent to 25 percent of&#13;
global research expenditures [71]. This increase, together with the invest-&#13;
ment in the IARC's can be expected to enhance agricultural productivity in&#13;
the developing countries. However, detecting and correctly identifying that&#13;
part of improved productivity which can be causally linked to investment in&#13;
research is a difficult and at best, imperfect exercise.&#13;
3.03      Three principal problems arise.   Firstly, there are substantial&#13;
lags (possibly up to 10 years) before a perceptible return can be expected.&#13;
Second, annual variations due to weather conditions make calculations of the&#13;
growth rates in output and productivity very sensitive to the selection of&#13;
the base period. Third, the research results are applicable to only certain&#13;
commodities and for certain areas within countries. That per capita food&#13;
availability in the developing world has not increased substantially in the&#13;
last twenty years is not necessarily an indictment of research investment.&#13;
It does, however, constitute a challenge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
3q04      If these countries are to achieve the very modest goal of increasing&#13;
per capita food availability by 1 percent per year, output will have to grow&#13;
at between 3 and 4 percento Expansion of area is unlikely to exceed 1 per-&#13;
cent per year, so that yield increases will need to average 2.5 percent&#13;
per yearo For several low income food deficit countries, imports would be&#13;
required to meet a projected deficit by 1990 of 35 million metric tons if&#13;
the 1975 per capita consumption level is to be maintainedc But the magnitude&#13;
of the foreign exchange requirements needed to meet this minimal level of&#13;
consumption probably preclude the use of commercial imports0 A radically&#13;
improved performance in domestic food production is imperative.&#13;
B. Adoption of High Yielding Varieties of Rice and Wheat&#13;
3o05      The adoption of high yielding varieties of rice and wheat has been&#13;
both rapid and widespread wherever they have been ecologically adapted.. Re-&#13;
cent data are shown in Table 10&#13;

High yielding wheat and rice varieties were introduced about 1965-66. Twelve&#13;
years later over one third of the total area in these cereals (representing&#13;
55 million hectares) was sown to high yielding varieties. This probably&#13;
represents the single most significant, widespread, and rapidly adopted&#13;
agricultural innovation in history. By 1976-77, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,&#13;
and Nepal all had about 75 percent of their wheat area sown to high yielding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
varieties. While the adoption of rice varieties has spread to 25 million&#13;
hectares (as compared to 29 million for wheat), the proportions sown to high&#13;
yielding rices are lower. In Asia, the Philippines had almost 70 percent in&#13;
1976-77; five other countries (Korea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan)&#13;
had over one third. In Latin America, over 90 percent of the Mexican wheat&#13;
area was sown to high yielding varieties, as was virtually all the rice area&#13;
of Colombia. However, South and East Asia account for almost 80 percent of&#13;
the total area sown to high yielding wheat and rice varieties.&#13;
3.06      Globally, there has been no dimunition in the rate of increase of&#13;
the area sown to high yielding varieties since their introduction in the mid-&#13;
sixties. A remarkably constant rate of about 4.5 million hectares has been&#13;
added every year since 1965-66. But this must be expected to slow down in&#13;
the future. In some countries, virtually all the suitable land is presently&#13;
sown to high yielding varieties. Further increases in the proportion of HYV&#13;
wheat area in Pakistan, Nepal and India, Mexico and rice in the Philippines,&#13;
Malaysia, Pakistan and Colombia will likely be modest. In addition the yield&#13;
superiority of HYV's has been shown to decline as the proportion of the total&#13;
area dedicated to them expands to encompass more marginal land and areas with&#13;
less adequate irrigation [516]. With the rapid increase in the demand for&#13;
seed of HYV's in the early years some problems of seed quality emerged, so&#13;
that part of the decline in HYV superiority may be transitory; improved&#13;
seed production and distribution can be expected to overcome this problem.&#13;
3.07      In conclusion, there is probably a rather limited scope for further&#13;
significant increases in food production from the simple extension of the&#13;
proportion of the cropped area sown to existing HYV's. When the IARC's&#13;
initiated their work, there was both (i) a wide technological gap between the&#13;
potential of existing dwarf varieties and the prevailing national yields; and&#13;
(ii) a large variance in the genetic material from which selections could be&#13;
made. But much of that technological gap has now been closed, and marginal&#13;
benefits to further search around the higher mean yields are likely to de-&#13;
cline. This has two important implications. First, it is likely the IARC's&#13;
will have to increasingly develop and draw on basic scientific knowledge.&#13;
Second, to achieve substantial production gains in the short run, attention&#13;
must be increasingly focused on the development of varieties suited to a&#13;
broader range of ecological conditions; and even more importantly to invest-&#13;
ment in complementary inputs (specifically water control) which would permit&#13;
a broader use of existing varieties. Dwarf wheats and rices were bred spe-&#13;
cifically to respond to higher levels of nitrogen with better water control.&#13;
It is evident that some of that potential remains to be exploited. On the&#13;
other hand, while the IARC's are devoting more effort to changing the plant&#13;
type to suit the environment, no new varieties that substantially raise the&#13;
potential of areas with poorer water control, lower fertility and periodic&#13;
drought stress have yet emerged, and no major breakthrough seems imminent.&#13;
However, when existing technology is combined with propitious pricing and&#13;
investment policies, significant gains in productivity and output can follow&#13;
(as in Kenyan maize production). This represents an important avenue for&#13;
short-run increases in food supplies.&#13;

Coincident with the advent of HYV's, production of rice and wheat in the&#13;
developing market economies grew respectively at 2.4 and 4o0 percent annually,&#13;
compared with 0.9 and 2.4 percent in the early sixties0 Part of this increase&#13;
is undoubtedly due to the two poor crop years in the base period0 However,&#13;
the contribution of yields to this growth increased to over 50 percent in the&#13;
later period. The data for rice and wheat contrast sharply with the fall in&#13;
the rate of growth of coarse grain production0 These total figureEs disguise&#13;
some important regional differences. Outside Asia, the rate of growth of&#13;
rice and wheat output either fell or remained virtually constant in all other&#13;
regions. While some of this decline was attributable to a diminished growth&#13;
in area, it remains that the rate of growth in yields was often slower in the&#13;
preiod following the introduction of HYV's of rice and wheat0   The rate of&#13;
growth of coarse grain yields fell everywhere outside Asiao The results are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
striking and demand a much more detailed analysis in order to understand&#13;
better why progress in the rate of production and productivity has slowed&#13;
down outside Asia since the mid-sixties.&#13;
3.09      In addition to the growth of output some limited evidence is&#13;
available for growth in productivity, as measured by the residual growth&#13;
after correcting for additional inputs. In India the annual average rate of&#13;
growth of agricultural productivity in the late fifties was 0.81 percent; ten&#13;
years later it was 2.31 percent.&#13;
3.10      It is instructive to highlight the potential for rapid adoption of&#13;
HYV's whenever they have been technically and economically superior to local&#13;
varieties. Within four years of their introduction, high yielding wheat was&#13;
sown to 66 percent of the total wheat area of the Indian Punjab, while in&#13;
three major districts of the Pakistan Punjab over 73 percent was sown to&#13;
Mexican wheats within four years. By 1974, over 90 percent of irrigated rice&#13;
land in Colombia was sown to three dwarf varieties (IR-8, IR-22, and CICA-4)&#13;
developed by IRRI, and CIAT's collaborative program. Fears that farmers in&#13;
the developing world might be unresponsive, or that significant levels of&#13;
adoption could only be predicated on extensive public programs of credit and&#13;
extension, have proved groundless.&#13;
3.11      There does appear to be a relationship between the proportion sown&#13;
to HYV's and the annual growth rates of rice and wheat yields. Data for&#13;
selected Asian countries are shown in Figure 2. In Sri Lanka, the Philippines&#13;
and Pakistan, the average proportion of rice area sown to HYV's is over 50&#13;
percent, and between 1965 and 1973 their yields grew on average at more than 3&#13;
percent annually. In another group, Korea, Bangladesh, Burma and Thailand had&#13;
only about 10 percent of their rice areas in HYV's by 1973-74. Their growth&#13;
rate in yields averaged less than 1 percent per year.&#13;
3.12      While accelerated rates of growth of rice yields have accounted for&#13;
an increasing proportion of the output growth in Asia (and Latin America),&#13;
this result tends to obscure the very important complementarities with ir-&#13;
rigation and fertilizer. A further breakdown (Table 3) shows that slow or&#13;
declining growth in rainfed and upland areas has (with the exception of&#13;
Thailand) been offset by expanding irrigated land. This is entirely consis-&#13;
tent with the nature of the new varieties. In the absence of varieties&#13;
suited to nonirrigated conditions (which comprise almost 80 percent of the&#13;
rice area in Asia), increasing use of irrigated land has been a major source&#13;
of output growth. Typically an even larger share of output growth is at-&#13;
tributable to increased fertilizer. In general expansion of irrigation and&#13;
fertilizer use together account for 70 percent of the growth in rice output.&#13;
This method attributes the residual to modern varieties and other inputs,&#13;
which on average account for about one-third of the growth in Asian rice&#13;
output. Although such a breakdown is somewhat arbitrary given the inherent&#13;
complementarities between variety, fertilizer and water, it does serve to&#13;
emphasize the dominant role of associated inputs. Inadequate irrigation&#13;
prevailing in much of Asia drastically reduces the yield benefit of the&#13;
modern, nitrogen-responsive rice, both directly, and more subtly in that it&#13;

discourages fertilizer use through reduced profitability and greater risk0&#13;
Wet season rice in the Philippines can yield up to irrigated 750 kg/ha more&#13;
than rainfed at optimum nitrogen levels. Modest improvements in irrigation&#13;
can boost yields by 500-750 kg/ha, and high quality irrigation can produce a&#13;
further 400-800 kg/ha [208]o   The complementarity between new rice varieties&#13;
and better water control increases the rate of return to investments in&#13;
irrigation; increasing recognition of this result should enhance furthelr&#13;
investment in irrigation both in terms of expanded area and importantly.,&#13;
improved quality of water control in existing areas.&#13;
3.13      Estimating the yield superiority of HYV's relative to traditional&#13;
varieties is made difficult by the inherent complementarities with water and&#13;
fertilizer; to distill any meaningful average is less than straightforwardo&#13;
However, a sample of the evidence serves to convey the general order of&#13;
magnitude. A search of the literature unearthed 102 citations of the yield&#13;
superiority of HYV rice and 37 for wheat0 The data are given in Annex Table&#13;
2, and summarized below in Table 4. The data come from various countries,&#13;
regions, time periods, and are for both farm and experimental results0 An&#13;
unweighted average of the two frequency distributions was constructed using&#13;
the midpoints shown in Table 4. This crude measure gave HYV rice an average&#13;
40 percent superiority and wheat, 96 percento A detailed study for Latin&#13;
America [516] reported that HYV rice had almost twice the yield of traditional&#13;
varieties in that region, including Brazil.&#13;

D. Measuring the Economic Benefits&#13;
3.15      When combined with the proportion of the area sown to HYV's, these&#13;
yield differentials permit an estimate of the proportionate increase in&#13;
production due to HYV's. Some of these estimates are shown in Table 5.&#13;
Obviously, much higher impacts are noted when a more restricted geographical&#13;
area is considered. But even modest percentage increases for wide areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

represent a very substantial quantity of additional grain. Of course not all&#13;
this can be attributed to the research of the IARC's0 In the case of rice9 a&#13;
conservative estimate by Evenson et al. [392] indicates that the production&#13;
in all developing countries was growing at 1.5 percent per year between 1972&#13;
and 1975 due to investment in rice research. Of this, one third was attrib-&#13;
utable to IRRI, either directly or through collaborative programs. 1/ This&#13;
constitutes about 1.6 million tons per year9 which at $175 per ton represents&#13;
an annual flow of benefits directly attributable to the research of IRRI&#13;
of $280 milliono It must be stressed that this is the annual increment to&#13;
income generated by IRRI researcho Between 1960 and 1977 IRRI invested about&#13;
$100 million (in 1977 dollars). Suppose this had all been required in the&#13;
first year and no impact had been made until 1977, when an annual stream of&#13;
benefits of $280 million commencedo This would have represented a return of&#13;
21 percent9 even in the face of a 17 year gestation period. In fact, the&#13;
internal rate of return of the investment in rice research by IRRI through&#13;
1975 was about 80 percento This figure is comparable to the return on the&#13;
investment (in rice research) by CIAT and national programs in Colombia [516].&#13;
Whether such returns will prevail in the future as the spread of exist.ing&#13;
HYV's slows down is debatableo 2/ There is little or no evidence on wiich&#13;
to base an assessment of the return to continued investment in IARC's aS&#13;
national programs are strengthened and the emphasis of the mature centzers&#13;
changes toward programs of international cooperation and training. But even&#13;
under the most pessimistic scenario in which the entire rice budget of the&#13;
system were needed to prevent technological decay in existing HYV's, with no&#13;
further adoption, such investment would be highly profitable0&#13;
3q16      The discussion has naturally centered on the contribution of rice&#13;
and wheat varieties to increased output and productivity0 The newer centers&#13;
have not yet been operating for a period sufficiently long to have had per-&#13;
ceptible impacts on productiono In addition9 the mandates of a number of&#13;
centers call for improvement in farming systems rather than the more specific&#13;
focus of achieving higher yields for given commodities0 It will be mo,re&#13;
difficult to detect and quantify the success of these activities0 It is&#13;
recognized that selection and adherence to specific targets may bias the&#13;
nature of the research undertaken in favor of those projects having a readily&#13;
quantifiable measure of outputo&#13;
E. Interregional Disparities&#13;
3 17      It is now well recognized that interregional differences in eco-&#13;
logical endowments have resulted in an uneven pattern of growth follolwing the&#13;
introduction of HYV's. Some factors such as soils and climate which affect&#13;

output are essentially fixed, and technology must adapt to them. However,&#13;
other factors such as the availability and quality of irrigation [208] or&#13;
rural roads [448] may also have contributed to the regional disparities.&#13;
These factors can be modified. The work at IRRI [192] in identifying the&#13;
constraints to higher rice yields is helping to separate the "fixed" from the&#13;
"modifiable" aspects of the rice growing environment.   This will lead to a&#13;
clearer understanding of the relative payoffs to the alternate strategies of&#13;
(a) plant type modification where new characteristics are sought to increase&#13;
the adaptation of existing material, or develop new varieties for specific&#13;
environments, and (b) environmental modification, for example through improved&#13;
quality of irrigation. These two strategies are not mutually exclusive, and&#13;
for some regions the strategy will include improved water management and more&#13;
drought tolerant species and varieties. The work of ICRISAT clearly embraces&#13;
both these strategies.&#13;
3.18      Data for India [299] indicate that during the mid-fifties, output&#13;
growth was relatively uniform across all states, and productivity was growing&#13;
at an annual rate of up to 2.5 percent. A 'blanket' development program was&#13;
effective in raising productivity throughout India by modest amounts. However,&#13;
as unexploited technological possibilities became exhausted, further growth&#13;
depended on the introduction of modern inputs. In the early sixties, half of&#13;
the states had negligible or even negative trends in productivity, and growth&#13;
in many of the remaining states had slowed down. In the later part of-the&#13;
decade as high yielding varieties of wheat and rice were selectively adopted,&#13;
a striking pattern of regional disparity emerged. Growth rates in the "wheat"&#13;
states soared to around 20 percent per year, and more modest but significant&#13;
improvements came in two rice states. In the mid-fifties the three states&#13;
with the lowest growth in productivity averaged -1.9 percent per year; the&#13;
three highest, +2.3 percent. By the late sixties, these growth rates in&#13;
productivity were -1.6 and 14.1 percent, respectively. In the three highest&#13;
states output per worker and per hectare both increased; in the three lowest&#13;
both were falling. An inescapable conclusion is that the introduction of&#13;
modern varieties has greatly exacerbated interregional disparities. Gains&#13;
have been largely confined to the northwestern wheat states, with some&#13;
progress in isolated rice areas. The areas dominated by other cereals and&#13;
dryland agriculture have made little headway. The broadening of the scope&#13;
of the international agricultural research system is seen as being fully&#13;
consistent with these results. However, closer attention to ecological&#13;
diversity in the development of new technology will simultaneously demand a&#13;
more decentralized research structure. Evenson and Kislev [187] demonstrate&#13;
that a significant portion of interstate disparities in the growth of Indian&#13;
agricultural productivity are explained by research investment at the state&#13;
level. Furthermore, additional investment in the state sponsored research&#13;
and extension systems would yield an annual return of 40 percent. Such in-&#13;
and effective in the presence of strong domestic research institutions [88].&#13;

F. Adoption Patterns by Farm Size and Tenure&#13;
3.19      The question of whether modern agricultural technology has favored&#13;
large rather than small farmers continues as a pervasive element in almost&#13;
all discussions of technological change in agriculture0 Evidence from a broad&#13;
range of studies clearly demonstrates that neither farm size nor tenure has&#13;
been a major impediment to the adoption of new grain varieties [515]o Two&#13;
caveats are in order. First, the conclusion is relevant to those areas where&#13;
the varieties have been ecologically suited; and second, that small farms&#13;
have typically lagged in their rate of adoptions, but after an initial period&#13;
little or no differences are observed. Where small or tenant farmers are&#13;
relatively more abundant in the less favored ecological zones (as tends to be&#13;
the case in Latin America)9 then naturally adoption rates are higher among&#13;
larger farmers. Dwarf rice varieties spread rapidly on irrigated land in&#13;
Colombia, where in 19709 50 percent of the farms on which rice was the&#13;
principal crop were over 50 ha0 In contrast, upland rice production char-&#13;
acterized by a greater preponderance of small farms, experienced little or&#13;
no technological change9 and the contribution of this sector fell from 50&#13;
percent of the national output in 1966 to 10 percent in 1976. Absolutely9&#13;
upland rice production fell by over 60 percent in the same period [516]o&#13;
Initial adoption of cassava production methods developed by CIAT took place&#13;
principally among large growers with almost ideal rainfall and soil condi-&#13;
tions who were favorably located to serve large urban markets0&#13;
3q20      There is no evidence that the nature of the modern varieties is&#13;
inherently suited to larger scale productiono The widespread adoption&#13;
regardless of farm size is convincing testimony to their scale neutralityo&#13;
Within three years of the introduction of Mexican wheats to the Pakistan&#13;
Punjab, both owners and tenant farmers in three districts had 70 percent of&#13;
the wheat area sown to new varieties; and the smallest size group (regard-&#13;
less of tenure) had 73 percent as compared to 79 percent for very large&#13;
farms0 In the Indian Punjab, over 95 percent of the rabi wheat area in&#13;
1969-70 was sown to Mexican varieties by all size groupso The comparable&#13;
figure for rice in Tamil Nadu province was 75 percento Additionally, fer-&#13;
tilizer application rates were similar across all farm size groups0&#13;
3.21      While the inherent nature of the varieties has been acknowledged&#13;
to be neutral with respect to the scale of operation, limited access to&#13;
credit and input markets is frequently purported to be a barrier to adoption&#13;
by small farmers0 Scattered anecdotal evidence of factor market distortions&#13;
abounds; serious analysis finds few if any inefficiencies in input or output&#13;
markets. While input market imperfections presumably exist (often abetted&#13;
by the pricing policies of governments) the evidence of uniform adoption is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
consistent with the assertion that such impediments have not been serious.&#13;
While lack of access to credit is often cited as an obstacle to the adoption&#13;
of new technology by small farmers (and becomes the rationale of supervised&#13;
credit programs), Sen [517] reports that small farmers in India growing HYV's&#13;
of rice and wheat financed about 80 percent of the current costs from their&#13;
own funds. Contrary to the accepted stereotype of the small farmer, he does&#13;
have positive savings (albeit absolutely small) and will invest if the&#13;
incentives are attractive.&#13;
3.22      Certainly, large farmers have tended to be among the earlier&#13;
adopters of new technologies. But there are compelling reasons why this&#13;
was to have been expected. Farmers with larger potential sowings of a new&#13;
variety achieve economies of scale in searching for information, and can be&#13;
expected to invest more in learning about new technologies. Some evidence&#13;
suggests that their ability to process the information may also have been&#13;
enhanced by previous experience and formal education. Additionally, their&#13;
higher absolute income levels permit them to experiment with less drastic&#13;
consequences than semi-subsistence farmers. It is often the case that small&#13;
farmers, in addition to having a slower rate of adoption, choose input, levels&#13;
(e.g., fertilizer) below those observed on larger farms. Again, there is a&#13;
tendency to attribute this to unequal access to factor markets. However,&#13;
even if access is uniform, it might be that in the allocation of time and&#13;
resources to both farm and household production, small farmers rationally&#13;
select lower input levels. The integration of farm and household production&#13;
and consumption is generally much less for larger farms (becoming minimal in&#13;
the case of corporate farming). While there have been substantial advances&#13;
in the new economics of the household, applications to small farmer households&#13;
in developing agriculture are in their infancy. The data requirements are&#13;
formidable. Within the IARC's, however, the Village Level Studies being&#13;
undertaken by the Economics Program at ICRISAT represent an important begin-&#13;
ning on this work. Such studies should lead to a greatly improved under-&#13;
standing of the potential impact of technological change on family income and&#13;
nutrition in the rural sector.&#13;
3.23      In conclusion, market imperfections may well account for the dif-&#13;
ferential adoption rates in the early years following the introduction of&#13;
a new technology. But these tend to be imperfections in the market for&#13;
information. Such imperfections can be ameliorated by investments which&#13;
provide more ready access to information about new technologies, and enhance&#13;
the ability of small farmers to deal with the inherent disequilibrium created&#13;
by the mere existence of technological change. In the long run, investment&#13;
in training and education is the principal instrument of public policy that&#13;
can lead to more equal access to, and ability to process new information. In&#13;
the short-run extension, programs aimed at specific groups can provide a&#13;
substitute. To the extent that there are imperfections in the market for&#13;
traditional inputs (e.g., fertilizer and credit) these are frequently due to&#13;
attempts to provide access by small farmers at subsidized prices. The net&#13;
effect is frequently to foster non-price rationing mechanisms [447] which&#13;
almost invariably penalize those with limited resources, especially the&#13;
illiterate - in short, the very clientele supposedly to have been the bene-&#13;
ficiaries.&#13;

G. Income Distribution&#13;
3.24      The impact on income distribution of changes in agricultural&#13;
productivity brought about through public investment in research has become&#13;
a major element in both the analysis of the impact and in the planning of&#13;
research investmento The initial euphoria which accompanied the introduction&#13;
of high-yielding cereals has been dampened because of concerns with the dis-&#13;
tribution of the gains. These concerns are now being reflected in attempts&#13;
to broaden the goals of agricultural researcho Increased efficiency is seen&#13;
at best as being a necessary criterion for evaluating alternative investment&#13;
strategies. A more equitable distribution of the gains is frequently seen as&#13;
being of equal importance. Of course neither growth nor distribution are in&#13;
themselves adequate criteria0 Reducing relative disparities would probably&#13;
not be regarded as desirable were it to mean lower absolute incomes for the&#13;
pooresto Likewise, an increase in the absolute income of the poorest may be&#13;
deemed desirable despite a simultaneous worsening in the relative distribution&#13;
of income. But the mechanisms through which technical change affects income&#13;
distribution are complex, and the impact itself has many facets. There is no&#13;
one single clear and compelling conclusion that can be drawn from exataining&#13;
the historical impact. Further, only by a careful analysis of the mu:Ltiple&#13;
facets involved can the probable impact of future investment strategies be&#13;
gleanedo Such an analysis seems warranted in order that the potentia.L&#13;
impact, together with the limitations of agricultural research to effect&#13;
distributional consequences, be more clearly perceived by the international&#13;
donor community and the IARC's.&#13;
3.25      Any meaningful discussion of the impact on income distribution must&#13;
involve a breakdown of the problem into a number of separate issueso We have&#13;
chosen to focus on the following:&#13;
(a)  the distributional impact between producers in a given region;&#13;
(b) the distribution between landholders and labor;&#13;
(c) the distribution between regions;&#13;
(d) the distribution between producers and consumerso&#13;
Each of these is now considered0&#13;
The Distributional Impact Between Producers in a Given Region&#13;
3.26      It is clear that there will almost invariably be gains to t:hose who&#13;
are among the early adopters of a new technology. Their initial impact on&#13;
product and factor markets is likely to be small, so that in the short run&#13;
they will face existing prices for both their product and their input:so The&#13;
enhanced efficiency inherent in the technological change will lower itheir&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
unit costs, and consequently net incomes will rise. With their economies in&#13;
the acquisition of information it is virtually inevitable that large farmers&#13;
will capture these early gains. This will result in a transitory worsening&#13;
of the relative distribution of incomes. There is no immediate supposition&#13;
that any absolute decline in small farmer incomes should result; merely that&#13;
the incomes of the innovators will rise relative to those whose adoption, for&#13;
whatever reason, lags. However as discussed earlier, the available evidence&#13;
suggests that such a lag is transitory and small farmers "catch up." Their&#13;
competitive position would be permanently undermined were they not to do so.&#13;
There has been much attention given to this lag, and social, cultural and&#13;
economic characteristics of the farmer have been laboriously studied in a&#13;
countless series of adoption studies. In the light of the more parsimonious&#13;
hypothesis that informational economies can explain the lag, together with&#13;
the evidence that the gap is relatively rapidly closed, it seems probable&#13;
that an overinvestment of social science resources has been made in adoption&#13;
studies. These efforts could perhaps be more fruitfully employed in char-&#13;
acterizing the nature of technologies which would be relevant to a broader&#13;
spectrum of ecologial conditions.&#13;
3.27      Regardless of the transitory nature of the regressive impact on&#13;
relative income distributions, it remains inescapable that there will be a&#13;
permanent regressive impact on absolute differences in income. Even if all&#13;
the producers in a given area were to instantaneously adopt a new variety&#13;
which was completely scale neutral, then while the relative distribution of&#13;
income may be unaltered, absolute income differences will widen, merely as&#13;
a result of the existing inequality in the distribution of productive assets.&#13;
This assumes that prices remain unaltered, a tenable assumption when the&#13;
region contributes only a part of the total output of the commodity.&#13;
3.28      The impact of high yielding rices on interfarm income distribution&#13;
in West Bengal [517] is illustrative. Income per farm by different size&#13;
classes was compared with and without HYV's. The relative gains were similar&#13;
across all sizes of farms, varying from a 24 percent increase for the smallest&#13;
(less than 2.5 acres) to an 18 percent gain for those with 10 to 15 acres.&#13;
But the absolute gains were almost 5 times as great among the larger group&#13;
of farms.&#13;
3.29      In summary, if investment in the IARC's produces technological&#13;
advances which are both totally scale neutral and adopted by all classes of&#13;
landholders, then there is no presumption that the relative distribution&#13;
of income should improve, and in the absence of widespread and effective&#13;
redistribution of productive factors, absolute income differences will widen.&#13;
To castigate technological change for its failure to have a progressive im-&#13;
pact on the relative income distribution of different classes of landholders&#13;
reflects an incomplete analysis of research in investment as an instrument&#13;
of social policy.&#13;
3.30.     This discussion has been deliberately centered on the distributional&#13;
consequences of technical change within a region, and between classes of land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
ownerso A scale neutral technology was presumed to be adopted by both the&#13;
large and the small farmers. In some regions, tenant farmers represent an&#13;
important group of producers. Regrettably, too little is known of impact on&#13;
the multitude of contractual agreements concerning the sharing of input costs&#13;
and output, on the incentives of the parties to adopt new technologies. For&#13;
a particular institutional setting some insights can be gained about the&#13;
relative attractiveness of alternative technologies for the landholder and&#13;
the tenant [361]o The presumption that the tenant will have no incentive&#13;
to adopt a new technology because its bounty is captured by the landlord is&#13;
not universally valid. There is some evidence that the spread of HYV's has&#13;
been contemporaneous with a decline in the area under tenancy, although the&#13;
possibility that protective tenancy laws have encouraged owners to bypass&#13;
tenurial relations may have been a contributing factor. Also, the share of&#13;
the gross product paid as rent has tended to rise with the introduction of&#13;
HYV's0 In general, HYV's are a land-augmenting form of technical change so&#13;
that the effective supply of land is increased. This might tend to increase&#13;
the area under tenancy and lower rental rates0 But the landholder's demand&#13;
for land may increase as the profitability of investment in complementary&#13;
inputs is enhancedo If the landholders then have preferential access to&#13;
factor markets, a decline in the area under tenancy could ensue [425]o&#13;
3q31      The impact of HYV's on the relative income gains of tenants and&#13;
landholders will additionally depend on the size distribution of those&#13;
leasing in and out0 In India, prior to the introduction of HYV's over 20&#13;
percent of the land leased out was owned by holders of less than 5 acres,&#13;
reaching as high as 50 percent in West Bengal0 Swenson [320] reports. that&#13;
in one district of India the relative income gains for owner operators and&#13;
tenants were 15 and 17 percent respectively. The manner in which a new&#13;
technology affects both the evolution of the contractual arrangements; and&#13;
incentives to adoption, and how the respective bargaining strengths change&#13;
over time is imperfectly understood. Further attention to these issues by&#13;
social scientists within those IARC's whose producer clientele include a&#13;
significant proportion of tenant farmers may represent a potentially useful&#13;
contribution to the design of technologyo&#13;
Between Landholders and Laborers&#13;
3.32      Technical change will initially reduce the demand for inputs. By&#13;
its very nature, it allows the existing level of output to be produced with&#13;
less resources0 In the longer run, it is this release of resources engen-&#13;
dered by enhanced agricultural productivity that is a fundamental source of&#13;
economic growth0 However, the expansion of production is frequently such&#13;
that there is a positive net effect on the demand for inputso&#13;
3.33      The manner in which the technological change will affect the demand&#13;
for inputs will depend, in part, on its inherent characteristics or biases0&#13;
If it is neutral with respect to factor use, then a proportionate saving will&#13;
initially be made in the employment of all factors0 More commonly, the tech-&#13;
nology is biased toward saving more of one factor than another0 Naturally,&#13;
one might suppose that the direction of this bias would be toward saving the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
relatively scarcer factor, and indeed this has often been the case. In&#13;
Japan, land was relatively scarce and labor abundant so that the types of&#13;
innovation tended to save the scarce factor land, through biological and&#13;
chemical innovations. This contrasts with the U.S. where relative labor&#13;
scarcity and land abundance lead to mechanical innovations which were labor&#13;
saving. The overall growth in agricultural productivity was comparable -&#13;
the paths differed, reflecting the differing factor endowments [41].&#13;
3.34      Concern is sometimes expressed that the IARC's should endeavor to&#13;
produce technologies which are labor using, given the widely held belief that&#13;
abundant labor is available in the rural areas of the developing countries.&#13;
What is not so generally appreciated is that simply choosing those technolo-&#13;
gies which have the highest payoff, will automatically tend to bias the type&#13;
of technological strategy followed toward more intensive use of relatively&#13;
abundant (i.e., cheaper) factors, and economizing on the use of scarcer&#13;
(i.e., more costly) factors (101]. A technology which required intensive&#13;
use of relatively scarcer expensive inputs would be less profitable and would&#13;
have a lower ranking based on the expected rates of return. A principal&#13;
difficulty in implementing this approach to the selection of technology lies&#13;
in the determination of the appropriate prices. Due to distortions of prices&#13;
through public policies, observed market prices may not reflect true factor&#13;
scarcities. An overvalued exchange rate, for example, will make imported&#13;
capital goods unduly cheap, and encourage the use of mechanization beyond a&#13;
level consistent with the real domestic scarcity value of capital.&#13;
3.35      This influence of factor prices confounds the analysis of the impact&#13;
of the high-yielding cereals on the incomes of landholders and laborers.&#13;
While at constant factor prices, the technology may have been inherently&#13;
labor using, contemporaneous changes in input prices may lead to observations&#13;
that are apparently consistent with a decline in the use of labor.&#13;
3.36      The expansion of production which leads to increased demand for&#13;
inputs has occurred simultaneously with the introduction of HYV's. In the&#13;
first place, the demand for food grains continues to rise with the expanding&#13;
population and growth of per capita incomes. In some cases, however, the&#13;
rate of increase in supply engendered by new cereal varieties has exceeded&#13;
the growth in demand from these sources. The rapid expansion in production,&#13;
however, has been generally confined to certain ecological zones. As a&#13;
consequence producers in those favored regions have faced little decline in&#13;
the real price of their product. The ensuing rise in profitability has led&#13;
to an expansion in the demand for all inputs.&#13;
3.37      If the technology is neutral with respect to factor intensities, an&#13;
equi-proportionate rise in factor demands will follow. However, this does&#13;
not constitute a sufficient condition for proportionate rises in wages and&#13;
land rentals, the prices of the services of laborers and landholders, respec-&#13;
tively. As the new technology is limited to a given region, the supply of&#13;
land will be relatively unresponsive to upward pressure on the rental price&#13;
of land, and the increased demand will only be brought into equilibrium with&#13;
the limited (or even fixed) supply of land at a much higher rental. There&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
is, however, both a short and a longer run phenomenon that will mitigate&#13;
this rise. In the short run, some land may be drawn out of areas currently&#13;
devoted to activities not favored by a significant technological change;&#13;
while in the longer run land augmenting investments (eogo, tubewells, land&#13;
reclamation, construction of levees) will be more attractive and tend to&#13;
increase the effective supply of lando However, it remains that technological&#13;
changes which are limited to certain zones will tend to be accompanied by&#13;
relatively rapid rises in land rentals in the short run, simply due to the&#13;
limited supplyo&#13;
3q38      In contrast, while land services cannot migrate to meet the greater&#13;
demand, labor can and willo Hence the supply of land will tend to be much&#13;
more responsive to upward pressure on the wage rate stemming from the tech-&#13;
nological change. Ramalho de Castro and Schuh [116] show that between 1966&#13;
and 1973 real wages in Brazil rose 16 percent, while real land values rose by&#13;
74 percent0 Jha [299] reports that the factor share of land rose in every&#13;
state of India between 1960-61 and 1970-71. Real wages did rise signi'ficantly&#13;
in the Indian Punjab following the introduction of the Mexican wheats., al-&#13;
though it must be noted that demand for labor in off-farm employment rose&#13;
contemporaneouslyo This latter illustration serves to emphasize that in many&#13;
cases policies with no direct relation to agricultural research will :Lnfluence&#13;
wages in the agricultural sector. To separate the effect of say new varieties&#13;
from tariff policies on agricultural wages would place more burden on the&#13;
data and models of economists than could reasonably be borne0&#13;
3.39      In summary, it is to be expected that new agricultural technology&#13;
which is restricted to a subset of the producing environment will initially&#13;
tend to exacerbate any existing inequality in the distribution of incomes&#13;
between landholders and agricultural laborerso The following data illustrate&#13;
this resulto&#13;

-27-&#13;
The absolute returns to both groups rose following the introduction of IR-8,&#13;
but the relative distribution of income became more unequal. Similar results&#13;
are given by Mellor and Lele [18] for 16 districts in India. Following&#13;
the introduction of HYV's of wheat and rice, gross revenue per acre almost&#13;
doubled on average, an absolute increase of Rs. 532 per acre. Of this only&#13;
52 rupees (9 percent) was for increased labor payments (both family and&#13;
hired), while 67 percent of the incremental benefit went to family land and&#13;
capital. The remaining 24 percent was for other inputs.&#13;
3.40      To this point, it has been assumed that the producing region faced&#13;
an elastic demand for its output, so that output expansion tends to increase&#13;
demand for all factors. Such was the consequence of non-uniform technological&#13;
change. The relative distribution of income between landholders and labor&#13;
worsened, although both had larger absolute incomes. Only in the event that&#13;
new technology were to be highly labor demanding and the supply of labor&#13;
were to be inelastic could an improvement in the relative income distribution&#13;
between laborers and landholders be expected.&#13;
3.41      Much attention is now being focused on the development of more&#13;
broadly applicable technologies: IRRI's work on upland and deep water rices&#13;
is illustrative of this trend. What might the consequences of this be-for&#13;
the distribution of income between landholders and laborers?&#13;
3.42      The assumption that producers would face an elastic demand for&#13;
their product must now be replaced; broadly adapted technological change will&#13;
imply that producers as a whole will face a relatively inelastic demand for&#13;
their output. Consequently the increase in demand would no longer counter&#13;
the reduced demand for factors made possible by the enhanced productivity.&#13;
But now land, whose supply is more inelastic suffers the greatest relative&#13;
loss. The results of broadly based technological change in the industrialized&#13;
countries is completely consistent with this scenario. The share of land has&#13;
declined and that of labor remained fairly constant, so that the relative in-&#13;
come distribution between landholders and labor improves - but simultaneously&#13;
labor is released from the agricultural sector, and its absolute total income&#13;
falls.&#13;
3.43      What emerges from this analysis is that investment in research to&#13;
enhance productivity is a relatively impotent instrument for making signifi-&#13;
cant changes in the distribution of income between landholders and landless&#13;
laborers. In the short run, some expanded employment can be expected, with&#13;
possibly a slight increase in real agricultural wages. However, a worsening&#13;
can be expected in the relative income position with respect to landholders,&#13;
whose command over the more inelastic factor, land, confers a disproportionate&#13;
gain in income. In the longer run, the relative income distribution improves,&#13;
but the absolute level of employment of all factors is reduced. Naturally,&#13;
population and income growth increase the demand for agricultural products&#13;
(albeit at a diminishing rate) and tend to be mitigating factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
3,44      However, that same rapid growth in population increases the supply&#13;
of rural labor, so that despite the presence of high yielding varieties real&#13;
wages are bid down and both the relative and absolute income of the poorest&#13;
in the rural sector declines0 Evidence from a number of sources indicate&#13;
that in the Philippines the share of income of the lowest 40 percent in the&#13;
rural areas has declined in the last decade. There is, however0 no immediate&#13;
presumption that this was "caused" by the introduction of modern rice varie-&#13;
ties (i.eo, that their incomes would have been higher in the absence of&#13;
new rice varieties). That other factors impinge is clear from the case of&#13;
Thailand, where a similar decline in the relative income of the rural poor&#13;
occurred in the absence of any widespread adoption of dwarf rice varieties.&#13;
Again, one confronts the almost inescapable conclusion that expectatiorLs that&#13;
new technology derived from investment in agricultural research can improve&#13;
the distribution of income between landholders and laborers, are likely to go&#13;
unfulfilled.&#13;
3.45      While any increased demand for labor may have had relatively little&#13;
impact on agricultural wages, the income of the landless depends also on the&#13;
total employment generating effect of the modern varieties. There is general&#13;
agreement that the new varieties have resulted in a modest increase in direct&#13;
labor use per hectare. Barker and Cordova [224] estimate that between 15 and&#13;
30 additional man-days per hectare were required in 2 rice provinces of the&#13;
Philippines, and increases of 10 to 40 percent over 5 sites in Asia0 Labor&#13;
productivity (in tons/man-day) rose by an average 10 percent0 Krishna [240]&#13;
reports a direct farm employment effect of new cereal varieties in India of&#13;
23 man-days per hectare. Most studies, however, are based on areas having&#13;
had access to technology and are limited to the direct on-farm effects. That&#13;
various samples of farmers in favored areas report increased employment&#13;
following adoption of new varieties conveys little information about the&#13;
total impact of the new technology on the demand for labor. At the farm&#13;
level, the new variety may or may not demand more labor in its own cul-&#13;
tivation; but through displacement of other crops and increased cropping&#13;
intensity, the demand for labor will be affected.&#13;
3.46      It is apparent that the principal impact on employment lies beyond&#13;
the direct impact on farm employment. The additional income streams generated&#13;
by the presence of modern varieties can have an important secondary eEffect&#13;
on employment. The strength of this effect depends on the magnitude of the&#13;
incremental income gains, the distribution of the gains between different&#13;
groups and the consumption patterns of these groups [17]o The additional&#13;
income is spent in part on food grains themselves, thus creating a demand&#13;
for the enhanced output; but this is only one category of expenditure, and&#13;
declines rapidly with rising income. In India, about 30 percent of the&#13;
incremental income is spent on other agricultural products, importantly&#13;
fruits and vegetables, livestock products and sweeteners. Finally the&#13;
balance is spent on non-agricultural products including textiles, footwear&#13;
and furniture, again having relatively high labor coefficients. As a con-&#13;
sequence, the introduction of modern cereal varieties can have a substantial&#13;
impact on employment, but much of that impact lies outside the food grain&#13;
sector, and follows from the rising incomes associated with the adopt.ion of&#13;
new varieties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
Between Regions&#13;
3.47      It is well recognized that the new varieties have been suited to&#13;
only a limited range of environmental conditions. A principal consequence&#13;
of this is that regional income disparities have widened, probably more so&#13;
than disparities between producers in a given region. The share of labor&#13;
in all but three states in India fell between 1960-61 and 1970-71 [299].&#13;
3.48      In part the regional differences arise through the nature of the&#13;
technology, but they also reflect the level of investment in local research&#13;
systems. The Indian states which have experienced the greatest productivity&#13;
and output gains from new foodgrain technologies tend to be those that were&#13;
undertaking greater levels of research investment prior to the development&#13;
of HYV's. This suggests that strengthening the national and local research&#13;
systems may plan an important role in reducing interregional disparities.&#13;
This in no way obviates the need for pursuing the development of varieties&#13;
suited to differing ecological niches. Centuries of natural selection among&#13;
plant species evolved a large number of varieties each tailored to particular&#13;
environments. Regional disparities in access to new technology will be&#13;
closely related to the research strategy followed. Whether one searches for&#13;
highly stable but narrowly adapted varieties or those with a lower potential&#13;
over a wide range is a question justifying much further research [1051.&#13;
Between Producers and Consumers&#13;
3.49      The impact of technoiogical change on the distribution of income&#13;
between producers and consumers is probably the most powerful and compelling&#13;
aspect of the distribution consequences, although ironically, that which&#13;
receives the scantest recognition in the debate. The benefits which flow&#13;
to consumers of agricultural products are more diffuse, less visible and&#13;
often harder to measure than the immediately apparent impact of the income&#13;
on producers. Agricultural economists have had a long tradition in farm&#13;
management studies, and are partly responsible for the focus on the producer;&#13;
but, recently, a broader view of the impact of technology has become more&#13;
prevalent, and the impact on consumers has been more clearly documented&#13;
[e.g., 304, 306, 378, 383, 516].&#13;
3.50      In the broadest terms, the gains from technological change accrue&#13;
to two groups: those who supply the services used in the production of the&#13;
output, and those who consume the product. The distributional impact hinges&#13;
on which groups are the predominant consumers of the product, and the manner&#13;
in which the quantity demanded responds to changes in price.&#13;
3.51      If producers face an elastic demand for their output, increased&#13;
supplies will have little or no depressing effect on domestic prices, so that&#13;
they, rather than local consumers, will capture the benefit of technological&#13;
change. Such has been the case for export crops, and where the new tech-&#13;
nology, through lack of regional uniformity, favored only a small part of the&#13;
total producing sector. But where producers as a whole face an inelastic&#13;
demand, their prices will fall and consumers rather than producers will be&#13;
the beneficiaries. Returns to factors in agriculture will be lower than they&#13;
would have been in the absence of new technology, and larger producers will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
forego relatively more income which would have accrued to their land, capital&#13;
and entrepreneurial skills0 These consequences lie at the root of farm income&#13;
support policies adopted almost universally throughout the industrialized&#13;
countries.&#13;
3.52      Low income consumers spend a much higher proportion of their total&#13;
income on foodo This proportion may typically exceed 80 percent. Addition-&#13;
ally, the proportion of any incremental gain in income allocated to food is&#13;
much larger than for higher income groupso In rural India, 79 percent of&#13;
incremental expenditure of those in the lowest two deciles of the income&#13;
distribution was allocated to agricultural commodities in 1964-65, compared&#13;
to about 36 percent in the upper decile [17]o As a consequence any decline&#13;
in food prices induced by investment in research to expand supplies confers&#13;
a disproportionate benefit on those in the lower income strata.&#13;
3.53      With the introduction and rapid diffusion of dwarf rices in Colombia,&#13;
the real price of rice to consumers fell. In the three years prior to the&#13;
introduction of the high-yielding varieties, the retail price of rice was&#13;
$(Col)3.6 per kg (in 1964 pesos), while in the three years ending 1974 the&#13;
price was $(Col)3.0 per kgo Rice is a major staple food in Colombia, being&#13;
the principal source of calories in the Colombian diet0 The lowest income&#13;
consumers were the principal beneficiaries, capturing a larger relative as&#13;
well as absolute share of the gains to the investment in rice research0 The&#13;
lowest income stratum captures annual average net benefits equivalent to over&#13;
10 percent of household income, while for those in the highest stratum, the&#13;
benefits were less than 001 percentO Those in the lowest income quartile&#13;
receive only 4 percent of household income in Colombia, yet they captured&#13;
28 percent of the economic benefits of the research program0 The Colombian&#13;
results [576] are vivid testimony to the power of agricultural technology to&#13;
effect a favorable change (both relative and absolute) in the distribution of&#13;
income among consumers0&#13;
3.54      As a result of recent research at IRRI [392], conservatively esti-&#13;
mated that between 1972 and 1975 consumers of rice in LDC°s wiere receiving&#13;
a gain of $(US)142m annuallyo Foregone income to producers was $(US);70m,&#13;
leaving a net benefit of $(US)72m per year. Of course, falling real prices&#13;
need not necessarily be observed0 Annual growth in demand may be equal to&#13;
that of supply so that stable or even rising prices may eventuate0 Wlat is&#13;
important, however, is that without the new technology, the rise in prices&#13;
presumably would have been even more pronouncedo Hence the difference&#13;
represents a legitimate gain to consumers, conferred in the form of higher&#13;
per capita consumption and higher real incomeso&#13;
3.55      Recent work at IRRI [290] has extended the analysis of the dis-&#13;
tribution of benefits between consumers and producers to encompass the case&#13;
of the semi-subsistence producero Throughout much of the developing world,&#13;
the poorest farmers retain part of their output for home consumption. In a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
fully commercialized agriculture with an inelastic demand for the product,&#13;
final consumers will capture the gains of technological change. Part of&#13;
these gains will emanate from the lower unit costs of production, and the&#13;
balance will represent transfers from producers. However, if a large part&#13;
of the output represents a major consumption good of the producers, then they&#13;
may gain absolutely from the new technology. In fact, as small farmers tend&#13;
to have a much lower marketed surplus than do the large, it is likely that&#13;
their incomes will rise absolutely, as contrasted to a decline in the case of&#13;
highly commercialized farms. For the latter, cash revenue declines (due to&#13;
the inelastic demand for marketed grain), and this decline is only partially&#13;
offset by the fall in per unit costs of production. Not only do small farmers&#13;
benefit absolutely, but their relative income position is simultaneously&#13;
improved.&#13;
3.56      Periodically, concerns have been expressed that the expansion of&#13;
cereal output, which has to date typified the impact of the investment in&#13;
research, may have had a deleterious effect on human nutrition. The result&#13;
is seen as a consequence of high-yielding cereals on to land previously&#13;
dedicated to pulses. A series of careful analyses conducted at ICRISAT for&#13;
the case on India [373, 374, 375, 376] establish that the nutritional impact&#13;
has in fact been favorable. These analyses show, that even allowing for some&#13;
diminution in the output of pulses, the actual production of protein, energy&#13;
and all essential amino acids (except lysine) was higher in 1975-76 than that&#13;
which would have prevailed in the absence of high yielding wheats. Although&#13;
about 20 percent of the expansion in the wheat area of six states came at the&#13;
expense of pulses, the greatly enhanced productivity of the Mexican wheats&#13;
led to an increase in total protein and energy supplies of at least 20 percent.&#13;
Summary&#13;
3.57      The distributional impact of new agricultural technology is a com-&#13;
plex matter, on which sweeping generalizations shed little light. Insight&#13;
into the impact and limitations is only obtained by a careful analysis of the&#13;
many facets. What has emerged from this review? And what implications does&#13;
it have for determining future strategies for investment in technological&#13;
change?&#13;
3.58      Overall, substantial increases in the supply of basic foodstuffs&#13;
engendered by technological change have a profound and favorable impact on&#13;
income distribution. As poor consumers spend much of their income on food,&#13;
they capture a disproportionate share of the benefits. The total supply of&#13;
food and essential nutrients is increased and real food prices are lower than&#13;
they would be in the absence of yield increasing technology. Widely adopted&#13;
technologies will at best leave unchanged the relative distribution of income&#13;
between producers. But absolute differences will widen so long as productive&#13;
assets are inequitably distributed. To expect investment in research to&#13;
significantly improve the distribution of rural incomes is to seek a goal&#13;
which is simply not attainable. The risk is, that such seeking might divert&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
resources from the urgent and continuing need for yield increasing technolo-&#13;
gies, which directed to basic foodstuffs, are themselves a powerful means for&#13;
achieving a favorable impact on the distribution of income, absolute as well&#13;
as relative. Increases in food production are an important source of addi-&#13;
tional income streams which lead to more broadly diffused economic growth and&#13;
an expanded demand for labor. That large farmers have more land and capture&#13;
absolute short-run gains from technological change is a matter for national&#13;
social and economic policies to address. Diverting attention from the fun-&#13;
damental role of international investment in strategies to generate widely&#13;
adopted, yield increasing technologies would be to overlook the vivid and&#13;
demonstrably favorable impact on household income distribution that can and&#13;
does follow from such investment.&#13;

IV. PRELIMINARY MODEL OF OPTIMAL INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
4.01      Technological change is no longer a happenstance event; rather it&#13;
is the product of conscious investment decisions. Scarce resources are&#13;
deliberately devoted to research activities with the expectation that the&#13;
resulting income streams generated by the research-induced technological&#13;
changes will constitute an efficient use of the funds.&#13;
4.02      Public investment in agricultural research in the developing coun-&#13;
tries is made through local, national and regional research institutions,&#13;
in addition to the system of international research centers. The volume of&#13;
funds (in real terms) which has been directed to these international centers&#13;
has grown very rapidly, as their number, size and scope have been broadened.&#13;
Some feel that this rapid historical growth is of itself a justification for&#13;
a slowing down, in order to allow a period of consolidation and maturation.&#13;
Certainly, any institution faces short-run limitations on its ability to ef-&#13;
fectively deploy large increments in real resources. If the short run supply&#13;
elasticities of critical research resources (e.g., scientific manpower) is&#13;
relatively low, attempts to expand rapidly may simply bid up the prices of&#13;
their services, without increasing the real output of technological develop-&#13;
ments [392].&#13;
4.03      On the other hand, it has been noted that analyses of the social&#13;
return to investment in research in the past, almost universally demonstrate&#13;
high rates of return. This suggests that historically, there has been under-&#13;
investment in agricultural research, and rather than being reduced, the rate&#13;
of investment should be maintained, or even perhaps accelerated.&#13;
4.04      This section describes a simulation model which was developed in an&#13;
attempt to address, specifically and quantitatively, the question: What is&#13;
the "optimal" level of international investment in agricultural research in&#13;
the developing market economies? Obviously, any such attempt must have&#13;
resort to the greatest simplifications of what is without question a vastly&#13;
more complex issue than that reflected here. The aim of this section is to&#13;
present a conceptual framework for considering the question, and offers some&#13;
broad orders of magnitude for the level of investment. By employing some&#13;
well-tried concepts from economics, it is hoped that the model captures at&#13;
least some of the more important determinants of the optimal investment&#13;
level. A principal concern has been to maintain a sufficiently simple&#13;
structure so that with a minimum of assumptions some empirical results could&#13;
be derived. From these crude and simplistic beginnings, richer formulations&#13;
reflecting more nuances of the problem might follow. 1/&#13;
1/   Vastly richer models have been prepared (e.g., the paper by Pinstrup-&#13;
Andersen and Franklin in [83], but they tend to be empirically demanding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. The Model&#13;
The model can be conveniently disaggregated into three components:&#13;
(a) a research production function;&#13;
(b) a supply and demand analysis;&#13;
(c) a discounted cash flow analysis.&#13;
Each of these is discussed separately.&#13;
The Research Production Function&#13;
4q05      In order to relate different levels of research investment to the&#13;
growth in agricultural output, it is necessary to specify a relationship&#13;
between these variables. This was derived under the following assumptions:&#13;
(i) In the absence of research, output would grow at some minimu.m annual&#13;
percentage rate (XMN)0&#13;
(ii) As investment in research increases, the growth rate of output g(XR)&#13;
would increase but at a diminishing rate; ioe.,&#13;
g(X)     &gt;0;         g(x)     &lt; 0&#13;
g(XR/V)             (XR/V)2&#13;
where XR   is the total public investment in research in the developing market-&#13;
ing economies (DME) and V is the value of their relevant agricultural outputo&#13;
(iii) The growth rate of output becomes asymptotic to some maximum growth&#13;
rate (XMX).&#13;
The particular form of the production function used was&#13;
9R)= X1.X   (H      M   e      &gt; 00                              1&#13;
g( i) = SMS ° (1 + (X/V))&#13;
Particular functions were obtained by specifying XMN and XMX, and solving form&#13;
to three for the remaining parameter Es given the point and 4.0, VAL4).&#13;
The 4 percent investment level was chosen as a convenient third point for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
which an "educated estimate" of the output growth rate could be made. The&#13;
production function is illustrated in Figure 3. In 1974 the percentage of&#13;
total research to the value of output (XR/V) was 1.21, 1.40 and 1.85 for&#13;
Latin America, Africa and Asia (excluding China) respectively [71].&#13;
The Supply and Demand Framework&#13;
4.06      This component of the model is presented graphically in Figure 4.&#13;
The initial supply and demand curves (S   and D ) are given by:&#13;
S : Q   = BP                                                    (2)&#13;

Market Clearing:   Qs = Qd = Q                                               (4)&#13;
where Q is the total DME output of the commodities included in the research&#13;
portfolio of the international agricultural research centers (IARC's),-ex-&#13;
cluding livestock. It is expressed in tons of wheat equivalents, 1/ and P&#13;
is the unit price of wheat. This form of aggregation of the commodities was&#13;
used, as satisfactory export price data for a number of the crops are not&#13;
available. The parametersa and 6 are shifters that capture the influence&#13;
of all the variables affecting supply and demand and their parameters, and&#13;
are not explicitly included; E and n are the supply and demand elasticities,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
4.07      Initial equilibrium is at (P , Q ).   In the absence of research,&#13;
and hence technological change, the supply curve remains at S and output&#13;
grows to Q1 as a result of increased demand (to D ) brought about through&#13;
population and income growth. With the introduction of investment in re-&#13;
search, the concomitant shift in the supply curve to SR and the quantity of&#13;
output rises to Q . The additional quantity due to research is denoted QR.&#13;
Hence, the proporpion of the growth in output due to research is:&#13;
QR         QD   Ql                                             5&#13;

1/   Scobie (470] has raised questions about the methodological procedures for&#13;
measuring the annual research benefits. The ensuing polemic (Jarrett&#13;
and Lindner [465], Sarhangi et al. [469] and Lindner and Jarrett [466])&#13;
has helped to clarify these issues. But in presenting their general&#13;
model Jarrett and Lindner note, "We do not underestimate the difficulties&#13;
of measuring the relevant variables in this formulation" (ppo 177-178).&#13;
It is precisely for this reason that constant elasticity of supply curves&#13;
which pass through the origin, have been used in this study. They are&#13;
readily amenable to estimation, given the imposition of an "external"&#13;
value for the elasticity.&#13;

The Discounted Cash Flow Analysis&#13;
4.10      The final component of the model combines the flows of benefits&#13;
and costs, and generates the internal rate of return (IRR) from investment&#13;
in international research. 1/ It is assumed that international investment&#13;
in research (X ) is some constant proportion of total public DME research&#13;
investment (XR1,&#13;
PCIR  =   (XI/XR).                                           (12)&#13;
The gross social benefits (GARBI) will occur as an annual flow, and for&#13;
simplicity they have been assumed constant. This is a conservative assump-&#13;
tion, as both supply and demand would be growing each year so enlarging the&#13;
area ABC in Figure 2.&#13;
1/   Alternatively, an internal rate of return can be specified and the model&#13;
solves for that level of international investment (X ) which would be&#13;
consistent with the given rate of return. As the motel is presently&#13;
constructed, it depicts investment in research as a "one-and-for-all"&#13;
project. Obviously, a more realistic view would encompass a continuing&#13;
flow of research investment for the indefinite future. It may be pos-&#13;
sible to view the solution (XI) as the long-run equilibrium level of&#13;
research investment (excluding maintenance), which is comprised of a&#13;
series of intertemporally staggered subprojects whose total investment&#13;
is annual amount equal to X&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
4411      Further assumptions are:&#13;
(i) There is an investment lag period of 10 years before any useable&#13;
technology is generated;&#13;
(ii)  As much of the production of the IARC's is in the form of biological&#13;
technology, a continuing stream of maintenance expenditures is&#13;
needed beyond the tenth year; this is taken to be a fixed proportion&#13;
(PMAINT) of the investment, (XI);&#13;
(iii)  The adoption of the new technology is assumed to occur in a lagged&#13;
fashion reaching its full potential after several years.&#13;
4o12      The flows of benefits and costs are illustrated in Figure 5. All&#13;
flows are discounted to the first year and that rate of discount which&#13;
equates to present value of the costs with the present value of the benefits&#13;
is defined as the internal rate of return. It is further assumed that during&#13;
the 10-year investment period output will grow at the minimum rate of XM4&#13;
percent per year, so that by the start of year 11 the value of output (as-&#13;
suming constant prices which is again a conservative assumption) will be:&#13;

4.13      Table 7 sets out all the variables, their definitions, and values&#13;
used. Some guidance for the values chosen was drawn from Evenson et al. [392]&#13;
whose analysis of all returns to investment in rice research suggested that&#13;
of the total growth of DME rice output between 1972-75, 20 percent was due&#13;
to research, of which 40 percent was attributable to IRRI. These of course&#13;
reflect only point estimates and a range of values is used in the following&#13;
analysis.&#13;
D. The Results&#13;
4.14      The model was run using selected combinations of the parameter&#13;
values given in Table 7. Obviously, only a sample of these can be given&#13;
here to highlight the more important features.&#13;
4q15      A summary of the annual levels of investment (X ) that would&#13;
generate internal rates of return of 10, 15 and 20 percent under varying&#13;
assumptions is given in Table 80 In the first line, a set of "most likely"&#13;
values was adopted. These results suggest that investment in crop research&#13;
could be expanded significantly without depressing the rate of return to&#13;
unacceptably low levels. For annual investments of $26 million, $75 million&#13;
and $179 million (all in 1976 $UoSo) the corresponding rates of return would&#13;

be 20, 15 and 10 percent. In 1976 investment in crop research by the inter-&#13;
national system was about $45 million, implying an anticipated rate of return&#13;
of 17 percento This could be expanded to $75 million with an accompanying&#13;
return of 15 percent, or further doubled with an expected return in excess&#13;
of 10 percento&#13;
4.l6      At first glance it may appear that implied rate of return of 17&#13;
percent on current international agriculture investment is low in comparison&#13;
with the relatively high rates that have been frequently reported [eogo, 378,&#13;
382, 392, 395, 405, 516]. However, it must be emphasized that the present&#13;
analysis refers to the entire DME crop area in about 12 principal food crops.&#13;
This area encompasses the full spectrum of environmental conditions and&#13;
includes much of the less favored semi-arid areaso International cereal&#13;
research in the past has been basically focused (very rationally) on the&#13;
superior areas, where a more rapid and productive research payoff might have&#13;
been expected. Further, the persistently high rates of return that have been&#13;
reported for past research may possibly be more apparent than real. A valid&#13;
concern is that they imply consistent and continuing underinvestment. While&#13;
the public decision-making systems are perhaps imperfect and function with&#13;
incomplete information, it is at least possible that the degree of misalloca-&#13;
tion implied by the high rates of return has been overstated. Lindner and&#13;
Jarrett [466] have shown that lack of attention to the precise nature of the&#13;
shifts in the product supply curves engendered by investment in research may&#13;
have led to considerable overstatement of the past returns.&#13;
4q17      In the second case examined [with the present model] the productivity&#13;
of research was varied. Even with relatively pessimistic assumptions about&#13;
the nature of the research production function, the investment level corre-&#13;
sponding to a 10 percent rate of return did not fall below $125 million.&#13;
This would represent almost a three-fold increase in the 1976 level of the&#13;
group's investment in crop research0 Further simulations were conducted to&#13;
determine those elements to which the rate of return was particularly sensi-&#13;
tive. Predominant among these was the length of the lag in the adoption,&#13;
following the availability of new technology0 With a 5-year lag before the&#13;
full benefit stream accrued, a required return of 15 percent corresponded&#13;
to an annual investment of $75 million0 But with lags of 2 and 8 years,&#13;
the corresponding annual investments were $99 million and $56 million, re-&#13;
spectively. This result highlights the importance of mechanisms to achieve&#13;
rapid diffusion of new technologies. While much of this responsibility&#13;
clearly lies with national institutions, the training and outreach efforts&#13;
of the international centers-constitute a primary link in the chain of difQ&#13;
fusiono The expansion of cooperative and outreach programs being undertaken&#13;
by the centers is seen to be consistent with the sensitivity of the return&#13;
to investment in research to the lag in the adoption of new technologies0&#13;
Eo Discussion&#13;
4q18      There are a number of possible avenues for enriching and extending&#13;
this analysiso&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
(i) A production function which distinguished national and international&#13;
research (and allowed specifically for interaction between them) would obviate&#13;
the need for the rather arbitrary apportioning of costs and benefits. There&#13;
is evidence that investment in national programs enhances the productivity of&#13;
research undertaken at IARC's through creating a more receptive environment&#13;
into which materials and results can be adapted and assimilated [88].&#13;
(ii) The analysis might be more realistically applied to disaggregated&#13;
areas, or individual commodities. Rather than treating all DME crop produc-&#13;
tion as one homogenous field of "wheat equivalents," the analysis can be&#13;
conducted for an individual product or for groups of products in a subzone.&#13;
Only the availability of data limits such extensions.&#13;
(iii) The model could readily incorporate subjective probabilities as-&#13;
sociated with the potential success of alternative research strategies.&#13;
4.19      The present formulation seeks that level of investment which will&#13;
maximize the internal rate of return. Implicitly, the objective is assumed&#13;
to be that of maximizing the gross annual research benefits (net additions&#13;
to producer and consumer surplus), after recognizing the research costs.&#13;
Some would doubtless postulate other goals: employment generation, small-&#13;
farmer income and human nutrition are all potential candidates as the objec-&#13;
tives of agricultural research. However, the rapid and widespread adoption&#13;
of new technologies for basic food production is one of the primary sources&#13;
of economic growth, and can simultaneously improve both absolute and relative&#13;
income distribution. For this reason, it is argued that the allocation of&#13;
scarce resources to investment in research should be made on the grounds of&#13;
economic efficiency: i.e., select that level of investment which maximizes&#13;
the present value of the future net income streams. To use other criteria,&#13;
may well lead to sacrifices in the very goals that were envisaged. This in&#13;
no way precludes the exploration of the impact on say, human nutrition (as&#13;
done by Pinstrup-Andersen et al. [372].&#13;
4.20      It should hardly need stressing that the results of the present&#13;
study are extremely tentative and intended only to provide some guide to the&#13;
relative orders of magnitude. In addition to the numerical values generated,&#13;
the study does offer what might constitute the essential elements of a con-&#13;
ceptual framework for considering optimal investment levels in DME research.&#13;
It is hoped that some of the more salient features of investment in research&#13;
have been captured without being excessively cavalier in the assumptions.&#13;

In some cases important pieces from those volumes appear as beparate&#13;
entries; but the user may well wish to examine the entire volume&#13;
for other papers.&#13;
(6) It is exclusively focused on public investment in agricultural&#13;
research.&#13;
(7) While an entry may include material on various aspects, only its&#13;
principal theme is used in its classification.&#13;
(8) The listing includes some entries which while not directly encom-&#13;
passed by the title, do impinge sufficiently to warrant attention&#13;
by those concerned with the central topic. Entries related to&#13;
growth and productivity in the agricultural sector, and the link&#13;
between the development of the agricultural sector and overall&#13;
economic growth are in this category. Entries of this nature are&#13;
a very small sample of their respective literatures.&#13;
(9) The listing is strongly biased toward the economic literature and&#13;
has relatively few entries from political science, public adminis-&#13;
tration, sociology, anthropology, or history.&#13;
(10) The classification is intended merely to guide the user toward&#13;
some broad areas; personal tastes, viewpoints and purposes may&#13;
well dictate a different category for an individual listing.&#13;

            Investment in international agricultural
            research : some economic dimensions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper first examines the
            socio-economic impact of agricultural research, particularly
            that carried out by the international centers. It notes that
            the high-yielding variety (HYV) cereal production
            technologies introduced in the mid-1960s significantly
            increased the total supply of basic foods and resulted in
            lower real food prices than would have been the case without
            such technologies. Major beneficiaries therefore have been
            low income consumer groups. The paper points out that
            widely-adopted agricultural technologies will at best leave
            relative income distribution unchanged among producers, but
            will widen absolute income disparities when productive
            assets are inequitably distributed. Although such
            technologies may increase the demand for rural labor, and
            therefore produce some income gains for the landless, the
            introduction of new technology is in general not an
            effective means to redistribute incomes among rural groups.
            The paper then addresses the optimal level of international
            investment in agricultural research. This is done using a
            conceptual framework to capture some of the more salient
            features of investment in research, using a research
            production function, supply and demand curves for
            research-generated agricultural production and discounted
            cash flow analysis.
