Community-Led Total Sanitation in Rural Areas&#13;
&#13;
An Approach that Works&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation programs have, for some time now, incorporated the need to raise awareness and&#13;
emphasize the benefits of toilet usage.This has been most effectively undertaken by empowered&#13;
communities motivated to take collective action, with the local governments and other agencies&#13;
performing a facilitating role.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 At the heart of this approach lies a paradigm shift to collective&#13;
 behavior change in creating open defecation-free environments.&#13;

 Sanitation remains one of the biggest development challenges in all&#13;
 developing countries. Improving sanitation is the key to achieving the         Concern in South&#13;

 pressing and persistent concerns for many nations even as they&#13;

 to rural sanitation is critical, given that a majority of poor households&#13;
 continue to live in rural areas.                                               Asia continues to be a matter of&#13;

&#13;
 Conventional approaches in South Asia have attempted to tackle the             approximately 653 million people&#13;

&#13;

 key ingredient for this to occur. Sanitation programs have, for some time       The practice of open defecation by&#13;
&#13;

 benefits of toilet usage. Even this marketing of sanitation, in order to        is one of the most serious&#13;

 construction by households) has not necessarily resulted in significant         health. Open defecation and the&#13;

 progress in securing the desired outcomes from sanitation programs in           failure to confine excreta safely are&#13;

 It is in this background that the significant results demonstrated by a         through the bacteriological&#13;

 heart of this approach is a shift away from the provision of subsidy-led        the transmission of pathogens&#13;

Box 4: India: Scaling up Sanitation Nationwide&#13;
Through Nirmal Gram Puraskar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Nirmal Gram Puraskar (meaning `Clean Village&#13;
Prize') was introduced by the Government of India in&#13;
2004. The scheme offers cash rewards to local&#13;
governments that achieve 100 percent sanitation (that&#13;
is, that are open defecation-free and have also tackled&#13;
the issues of liquid and solid waste). Providing fiscal&#13;
incentives demonstrates a substantive shift in&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal transfers--from financing&#13;
sanitary inputs, such as household toilets, to an&#13;
approach that emphasizes demand creation and&#13;
rewards communities for collectively achieving sanitary&#13;
outcomes. By providing incentives to community efforts&#13;
to meet collective gains in sanitation, the scheme helps&#13;
to raise the status of the village, create peer pressure&#13;
                                                                                       Children's brigade in action:No more open&#13;
among neighboring villages, and foster competition                                     defecation, stop polluting water!&#13;
&#13;
among all tiers of governance within and across states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The response to the scheme has been tremendous. In February 2005, for                  The Spread of the&#13;

government) received the Nirmal Gram Puruskar and in February 2006 this                CLTS Approach in&#13;
number went up to 760 gram panchayats and 9 block panchayats (an&#13;
intermediate tier of elected rural local government).                                  Maharashtra and&#13;

The question is based on an                process of self-realization by the        drawing on resources from civil&#13;

            areas : an approach that works

        <abstracts>
            Sanitation remains one of the biggest
            development challenges in all developing countries.
            Improving sanitation is the key to achieving the
            health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of
            reducing child mortality and combating disease. However,
            these outcomes will remain pressing and persistent concerns
            for many nations even as they approach the goal of halving
            the number of the world's poor by 2015, which in turn
            will have considerable bearing on the progress of attaining
            this goal by itself. A focus on appropriate outcome-oriented
            approaches to rural sanitation is critical, given that a
            majority of poor households continue to live in rural areas.
