Climate Risk Screening of the WSP Portfolio in India&#13;
&#13;
Identifying Key Risk Areas and&#13;
Potential Opportunities&#13;
This Field Note discusses the risks of climate change and the adaptation measures that need to be&#13;
taken to minimize these risks. Adaptation can be seen as an opportunity to improve current systems&#13;
of working, enhance policy and design procedures, and bring communities together as they face a&#13;
common problem.&#13;
&amp;#12;Background&#13;
The 2009 Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting in&#13;
Copenhagen, and the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report (2007), has confirmed the&#13;
consensus amongst scientists and policy makers that human-induced global climate change is now occurring. The&#13;
Copenhagen meeting also confirmed the need for action to mitigate and adapt to climate change. India has recently&#13;
signed the Copenhagen accord, agreeing to work with other nations to address the issues and threats posed by&#13;
climate change.&#13;
&#13;
The threats of climate change to the global and local water balances are expected to be significant. The donors&#13;
who provide aid to countries such as India are now concerned that the aid given may not deliver the expected&#13;
benefits. Thus the risks posed by climate change need to be assessed and practical adaptation measures are&#13;
required to minimize the threats of man-made climate change.&#13;
&#13;
In this report, the major issues of climate change as they affect rural and urban water supply and sanitation in&#13;
India are addressed through a risk screening of the Water and Sanitation Program's (WSP's) work during 2009­10.&#13;
Also, the potential to adapt to climate change is going to be a key issue for the future and so recommendations&#13;
on adaptation measures are presented. Finally, a draft action plan is developed to achieve these adaptations.&#13;
&#13;

   Box 1: Terms of Reference&#13;
&#13;
   The Department for International Development is one of the Water and Sanitation Program­South Asia's&#13;
   (WSP-SA's) main donors in India and has requested a climate change screening exercise throughout the WSP India&#13;
   portfolio identifying key risk areas and potential opportunities. Specifically, the deliverables for this risk screening are:&#13;
&#13;
      Review the India FY10 business plan project sheets in the areas of rural and urban water supply and sanitation.&#13;
      Prepare a short report identifying the risks posed by climate change to activities in the project sheets, as well as&#13;
      opportunities in the form of mitigation or adaptation strategies.&#13;
      Provide recommendations on how to address the risks and opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
   Based on findings from the above study, an action plan is also needed on how to take forward the various&#13;
   recommendations (addressing key risks and opportunities).&#13;

   Box 2: The Water and Sanitation Program&#13;
&#13;
   The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) is a multi-donor trust funded program that operates through four regional&#13;
   offices in Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and South Asia. The mission of WSP is to help poor people gain&#13;
   sustained access to water supply and sanitation services. It achieves this in partnership with client governments and&#13;
   other agencies through analysis of sector problems, identification of solutions, and documenting and sharing lessons&#13;
   from the field. This provides the evidence needed for WSP to support its government clients as well as to develop&#13;
   and implement policies, strategies, and investments. All of these are aimed at achieving the Millennium Development&#13;
   Goals. There are four specific projects considered in this report, concerning WSP's work in India:&#13;
&#13;
   SA/IND/55: Improving sustainability of rural drinking water supply.&#13;
&#13;
   SA/IND/56: Scaling up and sustaining rural sanitation outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
   SA/IND/57: Improving urban water service delivery in India.&#13;
&#13;
   SA/IND/58: Improving urban sanitation and municipal solid waste management services.&#13;

            Climate risk screening of the WSP portfolio
            n India : indentifying key risk areas and potential opportunities
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This field note discusses the risks of
            climate change and the adaptation measures that need to be
            taken to minimize these risks. Adaptation can be seen as an
            opportunity to improve current systems of working, enhance
            policy and design procedures, and bring communities together
            as they face a common problem. In this report, the major
            issues of climate change as they affect rural and urban
            water supply and sanitation in India are addressed through a
            risk screening of the Water and Sanitation Program's
            (WSP's) work during 2009-10. Also, the potential to
            adapt to climate change is going to be a key issue for the
            future and so recommendations on adaptation measures are
            presented. Finally, a draft action plan is developed to
            achieve these adaptations.
