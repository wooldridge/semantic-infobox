WBI's Community Empowerment and Social Inclusion program (CESI) focuses on citizen strengthening&#13;
and institutional reform to further the World Bank's mission of poverty reduction. CESI's&#13;
interdisciplinary learning tools enhance the capacity of the poor and marginalized to drive their own&#13;
development; these tools also help institutions respond better to the needs of their constituents. To&#13;
achieve these results, CESI facilitates dialogue between government and citizens, and builds the skills&#13;
and confidence of communities to participate actively in the development process. The program offers&#13;
thirteen learning modules clustered around three themes: empowerment, civic participation and&#13;
governance, and social policy, and addresses social policy issues including gender analysis and&#13;
participatory monitoring and evaluation as cross cutting themes. Modules can be variously combined to&#13;
meet the needs of target audiences.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        This paper builds on the premise that civil society can make a significant contribution to&#13;
the development process, both on its own--as the "third sector" of society--and by working in&#13;
partnership with government. It recognizes the value of establishing an environment where civil&#13;
society can flourish, and the importance of good governance and of an effective dialogue among&#13;
stakeholders. The framework of activities involved in the development of civil society includes&#13;
two operational courses of action on which the paper centers attention:&#13;
&#13;
        i) One course emphasizes the participation of community groups, NGOs, and other civil&#13;
        society organizations in the implementation of government projects. The evidence&#13;
        gleaned from World Bank operations suggests that civil society participation can&#13;
        contribute to better-targeted, more effective and sustainable projects. Civil society&#13;
        involvement also promotes "social control" over government programs and the&#13;
        development of participatory democracy.&#13;
&#13;
        ii) The other course of action focuses on directly promoting the autonomous development&#13;
        of civil society organizations and their ability to generate and carry out community&#13;
        initiatives. This often constitutes a new dimension of public policy involving government&#13;
        support for independent civic action and the formation of social capital.&#13;
&#13;
        This distinction is useful in that it differentiates operations essentially aimed at improving&#13;
the effectiveness of government programs from those that reach out to support the development&#13;
of independent civic action. In recent decades the World Bank has significantly broadened its&#13;
dialogue and lines of collaboration with civil society organizations and advocated the concept of&#13;
participation by beneficiaries in government projects. Its role in the promotion of autonomous&#13;
capacity among civil society organizations has been more limited.&#13;
&#13;
        The analysis focuses especially on the role played by social investment funds in both of&#13;
these lines of action. All social funds have among their objectives a bottom-up approach in&#13;
project generation and the participation of beneficiaries as a means of increasing the efficiency&#13;
of projects. A few fund operations also focus directly on expanding the autonomous problem-&#13;
solving capacity of civil society organizations. The World Bank has been highly influential in&#13;
the development of the social investment fund model. Social investment funds are one of the&#13;
major instruments--perhaps the broadest and most operationally developed--through which the&#13;
World Bank lends support to organized civil society. During the past 15 years, it has financed&#13;
more than 98 social fund operations in 58 countries for over US$ 3.5 billion.&#13;
&#13;
        Community-Driven Development programs are another major operational channel that the&#13;
World Bank has used to support civil society. These operations entail a high degree of&#13;
beneficiary participation aimed at giving communities significant control over decisions on&#13;
project selection and the use of resources. Through CDD programs, a partnership is being&#13;
established between community-based organizations and other civil society organizations&#13;
(including NGOs), central government agencies, municipalities, and private-sector groups.&#13;
&#13;

        The report underscores the fact that women are the prime generators of civic action at the&#13;
micro level, and as such can make a significant contribution to furthering collective action&#13;
focused on community objectives. It expresses concern that new social technologies--such as&#13;
social investment funds--that have been assigned key roles in many countries' development&#13;
strategies are not being focused to the gender most affected by poverty. The report suggests that a&#13;
strategy for taking advantage of women's potential in the development field can begin by&#13;
expanding government operations in areas where women have comparative advantage.&#13;
&#13;
        Two basic characteristics are considered to be essential for capacity building to be&#13;
effective: i) It must be demand-driven, tailored to the potentialities of civil society organizations,&#13;
and conducive to their appropriation of the added capacity. ii) It must actually transfer quality&#13;
operational skills and knowledge (such as management and information systems, human resource&#13;
development, and project formulation, implementation and evaluation). Several modalities are&#13;
used to carry out the transfer: the "learning by doing" that takes place during project&#13;
implementation, technical assistance through the provision of national and external consultants,&#13;
and direct training programs.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1. Overview&#13;
&#13;
          The concept of civil society embraces the action of people who join forces to achieve&#13;
interests of common good. In principle, this so-called "third sector" of society functions outside&#13;
the sphere of government politics and is not driven by the profit motive; its structure is neither&#13;
bureaucratic nor corporative. It comprises activities of membership-based community&#13;
organizations, NGOs, advocacy groups, philanthropic associations of the private sector, and is&#13;
generally considered to also include religious groups that provide social services, and academic&#13;
and professional organizations (such as universities and think-tanks). The classification of&#13;
society into three sectors--government, private sector, and civil society--represents a breakdown&#13;
by function rather than by population groups (people normally participate in one way or another&#13;
in all three sectors). Similarly, what binds civil society groups together is not necessarily&#13;
geography but common interests. In fact, the extraordinary advances in communications&#13;
technology have contributed to the emergence of networks that span the globe (environmental&#13;
protection groups, for example). Finally, the boundaries of civil society as a whole are not well-&#13;
delimited and have changed over time; there is considerable overlap in what is considered to be&#13;
the confines of each sector. The general trend in recent decades has been for governments to&#13;
shrink in relative terms, and for the private sector and civil society to grow significantly.&#13;

&#13;
          There is growing recognition inside and outside World Bank circles that the development&#13;
of civil society is critical for furthering a more equitable and sustainable development process. It&#13;
is also generally accepted that the practice of civic action by communities is closely linked to the&#13;
formation of social capital, which in turn tends to foster economic growth and good governance.1&#13;
&#13;
1 See Putnam, R. (1993) "Both states and markets operate more efficiently in civic settings." ... "For political&#13;
stability, for government effectiveness and even for economic progress, social capital may be even more important&#13;
than physical or human capital." pp. 182-183. See also the World Bank's Social Capital Initiative Working Papers,&#13;

&#13;
         Community-driven development has become a basic tenet of the World Bank's policy to&#13;
assist countries in their programs to reduce poverty. The World Bank's Comprehensive&#13;
Development Framework assigns a central role to the contribution that civil society can make to&#13;
the development process--within a long-term holistic approach that emphasizes the&#13;
interdependence of all elements of development (structural/institutional, social/human,&#13;
physical/rural/urban, and macroeconomic/financial).2 This approach denotes recognition that&#13;
governments are not the only force driving the countries' economic and social development.&#13;
Civil social organizations are increasingly being consulted in the preparation of the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS), the document that registers the World Bank's assistance policy for&#13;
countries that borrow from the IBRD or receive credits from IDA. Of the 28 CAS documents&#13;
considered by the World Bank's Board during FY2000, all but three involved civil society&#13;
consultation (World Bank 2001b, p. 12). Moreover, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper&#13;
(PSRP)--an instrument that has become the basic framework for the World Bank's IDA&#13;
programs and the IMF's new PRGF,3 and the central mechanism for dialogue between poor&#13;
countries and the international community--requires the active involvement of civil society&#13;
organizations and their collaboration in the execution of the programs to reduce poverty. Nine&#13;
interim PSRPs and two full PSRPs were completed in FY2000, and all of them entailed some&#13;
degree of dialogue with civil society organizations.&#13;
&#13;
         In the context of the analysis presented in this paper, civil society development refers to&#13;
policies and programs aimed at benefiting the poor. Attention is centered on poverty-focused&#13;
activities at the local level--which is the principal domain of civil society. Widespread poverty is&#13;
considered to be the major economic and social problem facing less-developed countries, and&#13;
reducing poverty is at the heart of the World Bank's development agenda. A key concern of the&#13;
paper is examining how World Bank-supported projects enhance the contribution of organized&#13;
civil society to the development process and to reducing of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
         Civil society development is a wide-ranging concept that spans a number of disciplines&#13;
and can be interpreted from several standpoints. In order to establish a framework that puts the&#13;
analysis presented in this paper into perspective and delimits its scope, some of the main&#13;
branches of activity involved in the development of civil society are classified in four categories&#13;
(see chart below).4 The schematic framework does not specify causal relationships. However,&#13;
most of the activities depicted are complementary and highly interrelated. In particular, those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in particular, Grootaert C. (1998), "It has now become recognized that the 'traditional' types of capital (natural,&#13;
physical and human) determine only partially the process of economic growth because they overlook the way in&#13;
which the economic actors interact and organize themselves to generate growth and development. The missing link is&#13;
social capital."&#13;

listed in the lower box rely on the proper functioning of the ones in the boxes above. That is, on&#13;
the existence of an adequate enabling environment that is supported by a well-developed system&#13;
of governance in which civil society plays a major role, and by a close partnership among&#13;
stakeholders. Moreover, to a certain extent, there is a downward transition from "macro" to&#13;
"micro" branches of activity: those in the upper boxes being more related to society as a whole,&#13;
and those in the lower box more directly linked to local civic action. It is also relevant to note&#13;
that although the World Bank has been active in most of the areas in the upper boxes5 and has&#13;
strongly advocated the establishment of an enabling environment for the development of civil&#13;
society, its operational involvement has emphasized the activities in the lower box--and there,&#13;
mainly operations in which the participation of beneficiaries in government projects is a major&#13;
objective.&#13;

         This paper touches on many of the fields of activity outlined in the chart but centers on&#13;
those grouped in the lower box and, in particular, on several channels through which World Bank&#13;
operations support the strengthening of civil society organizations. It does, of course, recognize&#13;
the key role that civil society plays in determining the quality of governance in the countries, the&#13;
importance of establishing an effective dialogue among stakeholders working in the field, and the&#13;
fundamental need to create a policy and an institutional environment where civil society can&#13;
flourish. In other words, the areas of activity shown in all four boxes of the chart are considered&#13;
to have a bearing on the development of civil society. However, the paper's main focus is on&#13;
projects that contribute to expand the capacity for the civic engagement of community groups&#13;
and other civil society organizations.&#13;
&#13;
         Within this domain, the paper examines two courses of action that have been highly&#13;
instrumental in heightening the contribution of civil society to the development process:&#13;
&#13;
                   i) One course emphasizes the participation of community groups, NGOs, and&#13;
         other civil society organizations in the implementation of government projects. The&#13;
         evidence from a number of World Bank operations suggests that civil society&#13;
         participation can contribute to better targeted, more effective and sustainable projects.&#13;
         The involvement of civil society also favors "social control" of government programs by&#13;
         communities and the development of participatory democracy. Moreover, participation in&#13;
         government projects can engender benefits for civil society itself by strengthening its&#13;
         organizational capacity and self-reliance and by providing it with resources with which to&#13;
         operate.&#13;
&#13;
                   ii) The other course of action focuses on directly promoting the autonomous&#13;
         development of civil society organizations and their ability to generate and carry out&#13;
         community initiatives. This generally constitutes an out of the ordinary dimension of&#13;
         public policy that entails government support for independent civic action and the&#13;
         formation of social capital. Although in recent decades the World Bank has championed&#13;
         the concept of participation by beneficiaries in government projects and has significantly&#13;
         broadened its dialogue and lines of collaboration with civil society organizations, its role&#13;
         in the promotion of autonomous capacity among civil society organizations through&#13;
         operations in which this has been the overriding objective has been limited.6 A study of&#13;
         48 World Bank-supported projects and economic and sector work activities considered&#13;
         participatory (based on information from World Bank documents and interviews with&#13;
         task managers and other World Bank staff) indicates that "with regard to the stated&#13;
         objectives of participation, these were most commonly concerned with cost-sharing,&#13;
         project efficiency, and project effectiveness rather than with building the capacity of&#13;
         beneficiaries or empowering them to initiate their own activities." 7 A recent review of&#13;

6 This situation has to a certain extent been determined by the fact that World Bank loan operations are made only to&#13;
member governments Â­ the World Bank does not lend directly to civil society organizations. The World Bank by&#13;
nature works through operations with sovereign governments, and its role in the direct empowerment of community&#13;
groups is to a large extent determined by the political will of the governments.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         World Bank experience in the field of social investment funds yields similar findings (see&#13;
         footnote 12)&#13;
&#13;
         In practice, there is considerable overlap between these two lines of action. In fact, any&#13;
degree of participation by beneficiaries in the implementation of government projects tends to&#13;
have side effects that will benefit civil society. Some of the projects classified in Table 1 as&#13;
having a high level of participation (in particular, those involving significant transfer of control&#13;
over decisions and resources) can also be classified under the second course of action,&#13;
"autonomous development of civil society organizations." The distinction made in this paper,&#13;
however, is useful in that it attempts to differentiate operations essentially aimed at improving&#13;
the effectiveness of poverty-oriented government programs from those that reach out to support&#13;
the autonomous development of civil society organizations.&#13;
&#13;
         The World Bank has utilized these two channels of support for civil society organizations&#13;
in a number of different types of operations. The analysis presented in this paper focuses&#13;
primarily on the role of social investment funds,8 project instruments that engage civil society&#13;
through both of these courses of action. All social funds include among their objectives the&#13;
participation of beneficiaries as a means of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of&#13;
projects,9 and a few operations also focus on increasing the autonomous problem-solving&#13;
capacity of civil society organizations. Both types of funds consider the input of civil society&#13;
essential and are designed to follow a bottom-up approach for project generation as a means of&#13;
targeting benefits towards the poor. However, the first approach emphasizes participation, while&#13;
the second, stresses the development of independent civic action (see Sections 2i and 3ii, and&#13;
Appendix 1).&#13;
&#13;
         The present document also touches on some other World Bank operations that illustrate&#13;
current practice in these two channels of support for civil society, in particular projects in the&#13;
field of Community-Driven Development (see Section 2ii and 3iii below). It discusses the issue of&#13;
participation in CDD programs and cites some examples of best practice projects centered on&#13;
supporting the autonomous development of civil society.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8 The analysis here presented does not include funds such as Mexico's PRONASOL and Colombia's Red de&#13;
Solidaridad Social, which are different in nature and much wider in scope than most funds (they are given major&#13;
responsibility for managing entire segments of a government's social policy). AGETIPS and the so-called Social&#13;
Fund-Related Projects are also considered to be of a different nature in that they actually execute public works. The&#13;
analysis also excludes the large number of funds that have appeared in recent years with highly specialized functions&#13;
such as assistance to ethnic groups, science, culture, etc.&#13;
&#13;
9"The fundamental distinguishing characteristic of social fund projects is that they allow local stakeholders to&#13;
determine investment decisions, through subproject proposals submitted by them during project implementation,&#13;
instead of being pre-determined at project appraisal" (World Bank 2001a, p. vii).&#13;

2. Participation of Civil Society in Government Projects&#13;
&#13;
        Government operations often rely on community organizations, NGOs, church groups,&#13;
and other civil society organizations as intermediaries for reaching the poor. Governments are&#13;
increasingly recognizing these organizations' potential for working with the poor and their&#13;
capacity for advancing small grassroots solutions that require considerable direct involvement--&#13;
often achieving greater effectiveness than government executing agencies. This approach falls&#13;
well in line with the policy orientation currently espoused by many governments favoring the&#13;
transfer of programs and responsibilities to the domains of civil society and the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
        As indicated above, this is the area where the World Bank has had more operational&#13;
involvement with civil society organizations, through their participation as partners and&#13;
intermediaries in the various stages of the implementation of projects. The World Bank has an&#13;
explicit policy of involving civil society organizations in the different stages of project&#13;
processing and in economic and sector work.10 OED's recent Participation Progress Review&#13;
shows that the World Bank's active collaboration with civil society has significantly expanded in&#13;
recent decades (see Table 1, below). Through project file research and interviews with project&#13;
task managers, the review tracks the changes in the level of participation for a sample of 189&#13;
World Bank projects during the period 1992-2000. The results suggest that the percentage of&#13;
projects with both low and high levels of stakeholder participation grew rapidly from 1992 to&#13;
2000 (see Table 3.1). The World Bank-Civil Society Relations: Fiscal 2000 Progress Report&#13;
reaches similar conclusions. The report indicates that during the period 1973-1988, NGOs&#13;
participated in only 5% of World Bank-supported projects. In contrast, by FY2000, 71% of the&#13;
projects under preparation and appraisal made some provisions for civil society involvement&#13;
(World Bank 2001b. p. 3).&#13;

          It is pertinent to note that the reported degree of "participation" corresponds to expected&#13;
participation and says little about its scope, quality, and effectiveness in project&#13;
implementation.11 OED's Participation Process Review indicates that although "participation&#13;
often produced impressive benefits for projects and participants," it seldom spread beyond the&#13;
project component and "had only a modest impact on institutional development." (World Bank&#13;
2001c, p. 29)&#13;
&#13;
i) The role played by social investment funds that focus on the delivery of social and economic&#13;
projects&#13;
&#13;
          Social investment funds represent an important dimension of the World Bank's&#13;
involvement with civil society--perhaps the broadest and most operationally developed:&#13;
&#13;
          i)       Funds have pioneered the "demand-driven" approach in many countries,&#13;
              furthering a process of consultation with poor communities and the participation of&#13;
              future beneficiaries in the implementation of projects;&#13;
          ii)      They have developed working relations with civil society organizations at the&#13;
              macro and micro levels;&#13;
          iii)      Finally, as will be noted in Section 3ii, some social funds have contributed&#13;
              directly to the development of autonomous, community-based civic action.&#13;
&#13;
          The World Bank has financed social funds in 58 countries; during the past 15 years, the&#13;
World Bank has approved more than 98 social fund operations totaling over US$ 3.5 billion&#13;
(World Bank, 2000b). The World Bank has been very influential in the development of the social&#13;
investment fund model, and social funds constitute a major channel through which the World&#13;
Bank supports projects that engage with civil society.&#13;
&#13;
          The social fund model that has been adopted in practice by most countries consists&#13;
essentially of a semi-autonomous government institution focused on the delivery of small-scale&#13;
projects that benefit the poor--largely social infrastructure. The "raison d'Ãªtre" of these funds is&#13;
more to increase the scope and rationality of public investment programs than to support the&#13;
development of civil society organizations and the empowerment of communities.12 The active&#13;
participation of project beneficiaries in the different stages of the project cycle is considered&#13;
instrumental in focusing operations toward real needs and improving the efficiency of project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11 Estimates "are based on a desk review of project appraisal documents for projects approved by the board at the&#13;
end of the fiscal year. As such, they often reflect intended involvement of NGOs and community-based&#13;
organizations, as well as actual participation in the project design. The extent to which intended or sustained&#13;
involvement of NGOs actually occurs during later stages of the project is not yet known. Moreover, the quality of&#13;
participation can vary considerably, ranging from quick consultative meetings to major responsibility for&#13;
implementation and monitoring of project components" (The World Bank Annual Report 1999, Table 3.5). For a&#13;
critical analysis of these issues, see Malena C. (2000).&#13;
12 The recent review of World Bank experience in the field indicates that only 32% of social investment fund&#13;
projects included community capacity building among their objectives and only 12% mentioned community&#13;
empowerment. "The nature of community participation was found to be sufficient for effective subproject execution&#13;
but insufficient for significant impact on community capacity or social capital." ... "Over all, social funds have&#13;
operated as consumers rather than producers of social capital." World Bank (2001a), pp. 39, xi.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8   Gabriel Siri&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
execution, and thus the cost-effectiveness of the operations. Moreover, a decade and a half of&#13;
experience with social fund operations has shown that working closely with communities and&#13;
developing project ownership can improve the sustainability and magnify the impact of&#13;
projects.13 Social control of a project by beneficiaries increases the possibility that it will be&#13;
properly maintained and that the programs of services that go with it will be set up and&#13;
sustained.&#13;
&#13;
         A World Bank portfolio review of 51 social fund operations in 34 countries (World&#13;
Bank, 1998) found that education and health projects showed more sustainable service delivery&#13;
than infrastructure projects, precisely because they incorporated more beneficiary participation&#13;
and communities had a greater sense of "project ownership". Similarly, the international&#13;
conference on sustainability (Bolivia, Oct. 1995) concluded that community participation has&#13;
been central to the sustainability of projects. The conference, however, voiced concern about&#13;
transferring costs to poor communities.14 Communities often lack the financial, institutional&#13;
and technical capacity to operate and maintain projects such as water works and other&#13;
infrastructure. As a result, sustainability suffers (World Bank 2001a, pp. 25, 26).&#13;
&#13;
         Another important concern is that participation has often been limited to consultation, and&#13;
beneficiaries have not been involved early on in the decision-making process. Although&#13;
beneficiaries are generally satisfied with the subprojects implemented by social funds, OED field&#13;
research found that " the subproject selection process could not be counted on necessarily to meet&#13;
the highest priority problem of the majority of community members."15 In order to incorporate&#13;
the voice of the very poor into the process of project selection and design, a number of the World&#13;
Bank operations have set up outreach mechanisms. One factor that has expedited the&#13;
development of outreach programs and improved the effectiveness of interventions at the local&#13;
level has been the increasingly decentralized manner in which many social funds operate (see&#13;
World Bank, 2001a, p. 13).&#13;
&#13;
         A related issue is the lack of ownership by the countries of the social fund programs&#13;
themselves, as reflected by their extreme dependence on external financing. In a large majority of&#13;
social funds in Latin America and Africa, the share of domestic budget financing is less than&#13;
20% (and in a number of cases, much lower).16 It is interesting that among Latin American&#13;
social funds it is precisely the two operations fully oriented to supporting autonomous civic&#13;
action (Chile's FOSIS and Guatemala's FONAPAZ) that have a very low share of external&#13;
financing--less than 15%. This suggests that these countries have been willing to spend their&#13;
own budget resources to support operations focused on strengthening civil society organizations&#13;
(see Siri 2000, p. 26).&#13;

ii) Civil society participation in other World Bank-supported projects.&#13;
&#13;
         There are a number of World Bank directives and a great deal of analytical literature on&#13;
civil society participation in government projects. The World Bank and Participation Report,&#13;
endorsed by the World Bank's Board in 1994, established an action plan to support government&#13;
efforts in this field and facilitate participatory development initiatives within the World Bank.&#13;
The World Bank's Environment Department, Social Policy and Resettlement Division, publishes&#13;
a Participation Series comprised of papers on different modules of the participation process.17&#13;
Civil society participation has been incorporated in most World Bank operations and, as&#13;
indicated earlier in this chapter, has increased significantly in the past two decades. In FY2000,&#13;
civil society organizations participated in some capacity in more than 90% of the agriculture,&#13;
education, environment, health, and water supply projects.18&#13;
&#13;
         One important domain of World Bank activity in this field is Community-Driven&#13;
Development. The central tenet of CDD is treating "poor people and their institutions as assets&#13;
and partners in the development process" and giving community groups a major share in the&#13;
control of decisions and resources.19 Through CDD, a partnership is being established between&#13;
community-based organizations (CBOs) and other civil society organizations (including NGOs),&#13;
central government agencies, municipalities, and private-sector groups.&#13;
&#13;
         Well-designed CDD programs are more responsive to the demands of the poor and tend&#13;
to be more sustainable. They are also more efficient and effective in delivering services in&#13;
different contexts and their potential for being scaled up by replicating their experience in other&#13;
communities is good. The outcome of CDD initiatives strongly benefits from the existence of an&#13;
enabling environment in the countries in which they are set up and also profits from good&#13;
governance and partnerships with other stakeholders (in other words, the success of CDD&#13;
operations is contingent on the fields of activity outlined in the upper boxes of the general&#13;
framework presented on page 6). CDD programs can also benefit from the progress made with&#13;
decentralization reform policies in the countries.&#13;
&#13;
         The category "Community-Driven Development" is quite broad. A number of CDD&#13;
programs provide funds for projects managed directly by community groups, and some are&#13;
operations that could be classified in the following section of this paper as "centered on building&#13;
the autonomous capacity of civil society organizations." CDD operations have proliferated in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17The series includes papers on education (Colletta N.J. and Perkins G., 1995), water and sanitation (Watson G. and&#13;
Jagannathan N.V., 1995), irrigation (Meinzen-Dick R. and Reidinger R., 1995), social funds (Schmidt M. and Marc&#13;
A., 1995), country economic and sector work (Aronson D., 1995), designing community-based development&#13;
(Narayan D., 1995), poverty assessments (Norton A. and Stephens T. 1995), indigenous peoples (Davis S. and&#13;
Soeftestad L.T., 1995), intermediary NGOs (Carroll T. et al. 1996), and forest and conservation management&#13;
(Banerjee A. et al. 1997).&#13;

3. Building Autonomous Capacity in Civil Society Organizations&#13;
&#13;
        The second course of action focuses on the autonomous development of civil society&#13;
organizations and on increasing their capacity to generate and carry out community initiatives.&#13;
Organized civil society has much to contribute on its own to advancing the development process.&#13;
Its contribution is not contingent on forming part of government projects, nor is it dictated by&#13;
government policy. Nevertheless, government assistance can be instrumental in furthering civil&#13;
society's institutional development and boosting its operational capacity through the creation of&#13;
an adequate enabling environment and the provision of technical and financial assistance.&#13;
&#13;
i) Capacity building: some general comments&#13;
&#13;
        To a certain extent, capacity building is linked to all the fields of activity included in the&#13;
general framework for strengthening civil society presented on page 6. However, the comments&#13;
that follow refer primarily to the operational activities in the lower box of the diagram and center&#13;
on programs for institutional and human resource development in individual organizations.&#13;
&#13;
        Two basic characteristics are essential for capacity building to be effective: i) It must be&#13;
demand-driven, tailored to the potentialities of civil society organizations and conducive to their&#13;
appropriation of the added capacity. ii) It must actually transfer quality skills and knowledge.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                         The World Bank and Civil Society Development 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Responding to the demands and the modalities of civil society organizations&#13;
&#13;
        The content and the methodology for capacity building need to be tailored to the demands&#13;
and potentialities of the beneficiaries. Civil society has its ways of doing things--its own&#13;
idiosyncrasies--which are quite different from those of government bureaucracies or private&#13;
businesses. Capacity building needs to adapt to local practice, take advantage of existing&#13;
capacities and, whenever possible, transfer control of the programs to the civil society&#13;
organizations themselves.&#13;
&#13;
        Civil society by nature manifests itself in a wide variety of organizational modes and does&#13;
not coalesce into collective representative institutions. It is awkward for governments to deal on an&#13;
equal footing with a myriad of existing or emerging civic entities operating outside the political&#13;
sphere, and to provide them with resources and technical assistance without undermining their&#13;
autonomy.20 Nevertheless, it is essential to safeguard the independence of civil society. NGOs,&#13;
religious organizations, and organized community groups strongly resist any imposition of political&#13;
dictates. The capacity-building process should not be used as a means of increasing central and&#13;
local government control over civic organizations. At the same time, empowering civil society&#13;
does not mean circumventing its civic nature by giving it partisan political power.&#13;
&#13;
Transfer of knowledge and skills&#13;
&#13;
        Furthering a climate where civic action can flourish is essential but not sufficient.&#13;
Capacity building must also entail the actual transfer of knowledge and skills. Respect for&#13;
independent civic action does not mean leaving community groups on their own to implement&#13;
initiatives by trial and error (see footnote 24). They generally lack specialized knowledge and the&#13;
ability to apply it, and the success of their endeavors often hinges on receiving appropriate and&#13;
sustained technical assistance in fields such as management information and project control,&#13;
human resource development, and project formulation, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
        At the same time, it is essential to emphasize the quality of the transfer. Grassroots&#13;
groups cannot afford to receive inferior technical advice--poorly designed operations create&#13;
long-term burdens for the intended beneficiaries, and project failures can have disastrous&#13;
consequences for the poor. It is relevant to underscore that good practice can be learned not only&#13;
from the North but also horizontally from the experience of other developing countries. A good&#13;
example is the successful transfer of technology that takes place among many social investment&#13;
funds.&#13;
&#13;
        Several modalities are used to transfer knowledge and operational skills to civil society&#13;
groups: i) the "learning by doing" that takes place during project implementation, ii) technical&#13;
assistance through the provision of national and external consultants, and iii) direct training&#13;
programs for developing required capacities. These channels of operation clearly overlap; the&#13;
learning-by-doing process is generally accompanied by technical assistance and training&#13;
programs. Recipients of training often include central and local government officials and private&#13;

sector organizations that cooperate in the process, but priority is generally given to civil society&#13;
organizations and, within them, to community-based groups.&#13;
&#13;
         An important issue is who is going to teach civic engagement skills to community groups.&#13;
Government personnel ordinarily do not have the capacity to play this role and training programs&#13;
generally rely on intermediaries with experience in the field, such as NGOs (with the&#13;
collaboration of local experts). The comparative advantage of NGOs lies in their natural&#13;
inclination for generating and promoting civic action at the community level. Thus, the selection&#13;
of qualified NGOs as intermediaries for executing training operations often becomes the decisive&#13;
factor in ensuring the success of the programs.&#13;
&#13;
         Training and outreach programs can profit from the new communication technology that&#13;
is now available at a relatively low cost. The World Bank Institute has been a pioneer in this&#13;
field. It now incorporates distance learning in most of its core courses and has established the&#13;
Global Development Learning Network (GDLN), a system that uses telecommunications to&#13;
interconnect the many learning centers that are being established worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
ii) Social funds focused on developing autonomous civic action: the case of Chile's social&#13;
investment fund (FOSIS)&#13;
&#13;
         A few social funds are directly focused on the task of helping poor communities develop&#13;
the capacity to solve their own problems and transform themselves from beneficiaries to&#13;
generators of their own well-being. A government program to support civic action at the&#13;
community level generally represents a new line of action for developing countries. The channel&#13;
offers social funds ample room to expand operations as they shift from the status of temporary&#13;
solutions focused on effectively delivering government projects to permanent instruments for&#13;
combating structural poverty. Putting emphasis on community-based solutions leads social funds&#13;
to focus on the types of projects that government agencies do not do well, such as microprojects&#13;
at the grassroots level, small labor-intensive operations, projects in highly isolated localities, and&#13;
programs for financing the informal sector. Obviously, these cannot be isolated operations; their&#13;
effectiveness and sustainability are contingent on their forming part of a broad policy package.&#13;
&#13;
         The leading example of this type of social fund is Chile's Fondo de Solidaridad e&#13;
InversiÃ³n Social (FOSIS), whose primary objective is to transform impoverished social groups&#13;
through interventions focused on increasing their productive capacity. FOSIS "strives to develop&#13;
and make use of the aptitudes and skills that the poorer sectors have, works with them, builds on&#13;
their efforts and creates opportunities for social insertion within the community environment in&#13;
which they live and work." ... "The work of the fund does not lie in the construction of education&#13;
and health infrastructure, on the direct creation of employment, or on compensatory programs of&#13;
social assistance." Rather, FOSIS "endeavors to strengthen the personal, organizational, and&#13;
managerial capacities of poor individuals, families, and communities--and those of the public&#13;
sector and civil society--in order to open up opportunities of social integration for sectors of the&#13;
population that have been left behind."21&#13;

                                                       The World Bank and Civil Society Development 13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        The FOSIS annual budget (about US$ 50 million since 1994) reflects these priorities and&#13;
is financed almost entirely with domestic resources. Current budget allocation can be broken&#13;
down into five areas: support to urban microenterprises (23%), income generation in rural and&#13;
indigenous communities (9%), capacity building in poor communities (23%), training of youth&#13;
(13%), and the social and economic development of vulnerable groups (19%). Management and&#13;
overhead represent about 13%. In recent years, emphasis has been placed on a "territorial focused&#13;
strategy" designed to reduce poverty in a given geographical area. Within the government's&#13;
strategy to combat poverty, FOSIS has established flexible and innovative lines of action such as&#13;
handing over programs to whichever agency is better suited to continue with their&#13;
implementation, and establishing a competitive selection process for projects and resource&#13;
grants.22&#13;
&#13;
        The bulk of FOSIS interventions consist of projects directly implemented by&#13;
beneficiaries, with the assistance of NGOs. These interventions include training programs&#13;
focused on boosting the capacity of community groups to carry out useful projects and take&#13;
advantage of the opportunities that connections with public and private organizations have to&#13;
offer. They also include programs to finance small-scale projects largely targeted to income-&#13;
generating activities of the poor and to integrating them into the mainstream of the Chilean&#13;
economy. Intermediaries play a critical role in building and strengthening the capacity civil&#13;
society organizations to overcome poverty, which is essentially the main objective of FOSIS&#13;
(Barrientos J., 1999).&#13;
&#13;
iii) Other relevant experiences in this field&#13;
&#13;
        Other examples of operations designed to strengthen the autonomous capacity of civil&#13;
society organizations can be found in best-practice experience of Community-Driven&#13;
Development projects. A number of CDD operations now have the objective of giving&#13;
community groups control over project management and resources. The report on Community-&#13;
Driven Development (Alkire S. et al., 2001, Box 2) poses the question, "what happens when&#13;
community-based organizations are trusted to control central investments?" The report presents&#13;
examples of two CDD operations in which project delivery improved significantly (Zambia's&#13;
Social Recovery Programme, which provides grants to community groups, and Bangladesh's Palli&#13;
Karma Sahayak Foundation, which provides microcredit to the poor using NGOs as&#13;
intermediaries) and two projects that show that programs can expand rapidly (NE Brazil Rural&#13;
Poverty Alleviation Program, which has financed more than 30,000 projects, and South Africa's&#13;
Mvula Trust, which provides grants for water supply and sanitation projects managed by&#13;
communities in remote rural areas). The World Development Report 2000/2001 devotes three&#13;
chapters to issues related to facilitating the empowerment of poor people and presents a series of&#13;
examples of projects in which giving control to communities has been critical to the success of&#13;
the operations (see Chapter 7, Box 7.10).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        The learning programs of the World Bank Institute have been another important channel for&#13;
reaching civil society. For more than 40 years WBI has been the World Bank's major instrument for&#13;
building local capacity through training and outreach programs. Training programs are clearly&#13;
there to support lending programs. However, they also perform another important function--that&#13;
is to maintain the World Bank's day-to-day dialogue with opinion leaders in civil society.&#13;
Moreover, to deliver the courses and adapt them to local conditions, the World Bank engages with a&#13;
variety of partners, such as training institutions, think-tanks, universities, and other civil society&#13;
organizations. WBI's strategy is to strengthen the institutional capacity of training partners so that&#13;
they will in time manage the programs on their own. To better focus on these activities, WBI has&#13;
recently created an Institute-wide program, the Community Empowerment and Social Inclusion&#13;
Learning Program (CESI), designed to educate decision-makers and increase the capacity of civic&#13;
groups to pursue objectives for the common good. Recognizing that women's potential is at the core&#13;
of the development process, CESI has made the gender issue a central theme that runs through all&#13;
its learning modules.&#13;
&#13;
        In addition to working in partnership with governments to expand civil society&#13;
involvement in the development process, the World Bank has also established programs that&#13;
provide direct grants to civil society organizations. The Small Grants Program has been a source&#13;
of support for NGO activities since 1983. In FY2000 the program channeled $2.3 million in&#13;
grants to NGOs through the World Bank's offices in the countries. Similarly, during FY2000 the&#13;
Global Environment Facility provided $21 million for projects executed by NGOs. Other&#13;
important programs that also channel World Bank resources to civil society organizations acting&#13;
as partners and intermediaries are the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rain Forest, the&#13;
Post-Conflict Fund, and the African Program for Onchocersiasis Control.&#13;
&#13;
iv) Capacity-building programs in support of productive activities&#13;
&#13;
        Civil society organizations are often involved in programs that support productive&#13;
activities in the hands of the poor, particularly in the large informal sectors of many developing&#13;
countries. In this respect, capacity building comprises not only technical cooperation but also&#13;
financial assistance to support small businesses in the hands of the poor. Combining the&#13;
discipline of the market with a climate of horizontal solidarity and social "networks of civic&#13;
engagement" can create an environment conducive to stronger, more equitable and sustainable&#13;
economic growth.23 In addition to benefiting the poor, civil society participation in market&#13;
activities can benefit the economy as a whole by infusing social capital into the productive&#13;
process.&#13;
&#13;
        In providing technical assistance and financial support, it is generally recognized that&#13;
better results are achieved if non-financial business services are kept separate from microcredit&#13;
operations (IDB 1997, p. 58). Moreover, technical assistance generally needs to be sustained until&#13;
the upgraded capacity has taken root and is likely to endure--a process that may require&#13;
concerted efforts over several years.24 It is essential that training programs that awaken the&#13;

Economic Commission for Latin America in 1990 concluded that one factor that successful projects had in common&#13;

&#13;
potential of grassroots managers be linked with existing extension services and other public and&#13;
private technical assistance programs, and with mechanisms that give them access to sources of&#13;
commercial credit.&#13;
&#13;
         The World Bank Institute's Grassroots Management Training (GMT) program has been&#13;
an effective tool for developing the business acumen latent in all communities, even the poorest.&#13;
The workshops program consists basically of four core modules: human resources management,&#13;
financial management, micro-project management, and production and marketing.25 The strategy&#13;
has been to work with local partners--particularly NGOs--in identifying training needs at the&#13;
grassroots level, and in designing training programs that respond to these demands and to the&#13;
practical limitations of poor people. The challenge has been to build in-country competence to&#13;
manage the programs--that is, to " build the capacity of local organizations to provide GMT&#13;
services efficiently."26 The ultimate objective is to create a virtuous circle of training that can&#13;
propagate the teaching/learning process at the grassroots level.&#13;
&#13;
v) Women's contribution to civic action and the development process&#13;
&#13;
         Although women's social and economic situation in most developing countries has&#13;
improved significantly in recent decades, it is still true that most of the world's poor are&#13;
women.27 Indicators of other dimensions of the nature of poverty evidence the same gender&#13;
imbalance: poor women receive less primary education, tend to be confined to low-paying&#13;
occupations, are more vulnerable to family crises and economic downturns (see World Bank&#13;
2001, pp. 5, 53-55). One inference that can be drawn from these disturbing indicators of the&#13;
extent of women's poverty is that targeting project benefits to the poor will in practice result in&#13;
targeting them toward women.&#13;
&#13;
         Almost all governments officially support the concept of gender equality but, in reality,&#13;
few have a gender policy that can actually put an end to existing discrimination against women&#13;
(see Berar Awad A. 1997). The fact is that women's considerable potential for advancing&#13;
economic and social development is not well-utilized in most developing countries. This,&#13;
notwithstanding that a number of countries have formulated anti-poverty strategies that include&#13;
significant investments in the social field--and that in recent years the World Bank has increased&#13;
its lending to the social sectors (now 25% of total lending). A serious concern is that new social&#13;
technology instruments--such as social investment funds--that are being given a key role in&#13;
many countries' development strategies are not being targeted to the gender most affected by&#13;
poverty.&#13;

was sustained, high-quality technical assistance. See, Informe del seminario de proyectos contra la pobreza&#13;

&#13;
26 Ibid. p. 27.&#13;
27There is wide disagreement among different studies as to the magnitude of the gap, and part of it can be explained&#13;
by worker and job characteristics. According to the UNDP, the GDP per capita of women is nearly one-third that of&#13;
men. UNDP (1999). Human Development Report 1999. New York, p. 141.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16    Gabriel Siri&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Women have shown considerable capacity for advancing economic and social&#13;
development, as well as for generating civic action in communities. Women are the main vehicle&#13;
for the intergenerational transmission of social development through the education and health&#13;
care that they provide to their children. Women also tend to contribute more than men to&#13;
maintaining small-scale projects that deliver social services, such as health posts. Moreover, they&#13;
play an important role in the process of capital accumulation at the micro level and have&#13;
demonstrated particular capacity for organizing into small groups to administer small businesses.&#13;
For example, evidence from microcredit operations in a number of countries indicates that&#13;
women's groups manage loan resources well, have a savings propensity equal to or greater than&#13;
that of men, and are more responsible about meeting repayment obligations. Furthermore, as the&#13;
share of women's income earnings increases, income allocation within household budgets tends&#13;
to focus more on real needs.28&#13;
&#13;
         Women are the prime generators of civic action at the micro level, and as such can make&#13;
a significant contribution to civil society's participation in government projects and to furthering&#13;
collective action aimed at meeting communal objectives. At the same time, to the degree that&#13;
civil society is involved in the implementation of government projects, women's potential for&#13;
advancing the development process will be more fully realized, and the share of benefits that&#13;
accrue to women will tend to increase.&#13;
&#13;
         A results-oriented strategy aimed at taking advantage of women's potential in the&#13;
development field can begin by expanding government operations in areas where women have a&#13;
comparative advantage. For example, in community-driven public projects, there is a certain self-&#13;
targeting of benefits in favor of women. Although increasing investments at the local level does&#13;
not guarantee that women will be given equal opportunities, expanding the participation of&#13;
community-based organizations generates new avenues for women's initiatives and facilitates the&#13;
tapping of women's potential for advancing social and economic development programs. In the&#13;
case of social investment funds, reorienting the composition of project portfolios can improve the&#13;
targeting of benefits toward women. For instance, health posts and primary health services tend&#13;
receive more extensive collaboration from women and be more utilized by them (IDB 1997, p.&#13;
30). Similarly, setting up microcredit facilities tends to open up opportunities for women, raise&#13;
their earnings and social status, and reduce their vulnerability. Finally, using NGOs as&#13;
intermediaries in the execution of projects can also be a way of incorporating women into the&#13;
process and expanding the benefits that they receive; NGOs are usually more sensitive to&#13;
women's issues than are government or private-sector organizations. It is relevant to note,&#13;
however, that although the strategy here proposed of expanding government operations in areas&#13;
where women have greater potential can result in large payoffs, it is not a panacea and is no&#13;
substitute for a comprehensive gender-focused policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28"Although women have often been denied access to credit by legal and traditional barriers, experience has shown&#13;
that women as a group are consistently better in promptness and reliability of repayment. Focusing on women as&#13;
clients of microcredit programs has also been a very effective method of ensuring that the benefits of increased&#13;
income accrue to the general welfare of the family, and particularly the children. At the same time, women&#13;
themselves benefit from the higher status they achieve when they are able to provide new income." Micro-credit:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        Training programs represent an effective channel for expanding women's role in&#13;
community-based activities and for taking advantage of their high potential in the generation of&#13;
civic action. The World Bank Institute Grassroots Management Training program uses&#13;
"participatory gender-aware training materials and methods" designed to incorporate women into&#13;
the economic and social development process. In the same way, outreach programs similar to&#13;
those used in most social investment funds can be good avenues for reaching women's groups&#13;
and expanding their capacity to generate social welfare projects and directly productive ventures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Summing Up&#13;
&#13;
        This paper builds on the premise that civil society can make a significant contribution to&#13;
the development process, both on its own, as the "third sector" of society, and by working in&#13;
partnership with government. Within the extensive framework of the activities that are linked&#13;
with the development of civil society, the paper explores two parallel courses of action with quite&#13;
different objectives and operational agendas:&#13;
&#13;
        i) Participation of poor, community-based groups, NGOs, and other civil society&#13;
        organizations in the selection and implementation of government-sponsored development&#13;
        projects.&#13;
&#13;
        ii) Direct empowerment of civil society organizations to enable them to pursue their own&#13;
        community development objectives.&#13;
&#13;
        In recent decades, World Bank involvement in civil society development has grown in&#13;
importance, both through expansion of the dialogue with community groups and NGOs and&#13;
through World Bank-supported programs that take advantage of and contribute to strengthening&#13;
the capacity of civil society organizations. Social investment funds are one of the major&#13;
instruments utilized by the World Bank to reach and lend support to organized civil society.&#13;
Although the accomplishments of social funds in terms of incorporating the voice of very poor&#13;
people into the decision-making process have often fallen short of expectations, there is little doubt&#13;
that the SIF model has helped to introduce the bottom-up approach to the formulation of&#13;
poverty-focused projects in the countries. Social funds systematically include among their&#13;
objectives the participation of beneficiaries in the generation and implementation of projects, and in&#13;
some instances have successfully ventured into supporting the autonomous development of civil&#13;
society organizations. Moreover, through their close dialogue with poor communities, social&#13;
funds have heightened public awareness of poverty issues and opened up new avenues for social&#13;
action.&#13;
&#13;
        The World Bank has financed close to 60 social investment funds in developing countries,&#13;
and there are hundreds of other fund-like operations throughout the world with somewhat similar&#13;
structures and objectives (e.g., AGETIPs, Demand-Driven Investment Funds, and other Social&#13;
Fund-related Projects). Moreover, funds are usually the quickest disbursing operations in the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18    Gabriel Siri&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
World Bank's portfolio.29 Although there is room for improving the social fund model in terms of&#13;
its impact on civil society development, an important niche of activity in this field clearly&#13;
corresponds to social funds. As a corollary, it also follows that strengthening the social funds'&#13;
partnership with civil society can have a significant payoff.&#13;
&#13;
         Community-Driven Development programs are another important operational channel of&#13;
World Bank support for civil society. These programs are government operations with a high&#13;
degree of beneficiary participation, aimed at giving communities a significant degree of control&#13;
over decisions on project operations and the use of resources. Building the capacity of civil&#13;
society organizations and incorporating their contribution into the development process of the&#13;
countries is a key objective of the CDD programs.&#13;
&#13;
         Supporting the development of civil society requires mainstreaming the process into the&#13;
day-to-day work of both governments and the World Bank. For governments, this presupposes&#13;
above all a political decision to create an environment favorable to civil society (i.e., removing&#13;
obstacles and setting up the appropriate legal-regulatory framework). In addition, a great deal of&#13;
institutional development is required; Governments will also need to adapt their operational&#13;
channels to this special client. This will normally entail employing the same types of mechanisms&#13;
that they traditionally use to support the private sector--financing, technical assistance, social&#13;
infrastructure, etc.--and adapting them to the needs of civil society. In addition, monitoring&#13;
systems that can track the attainment of short- and long-term targets will need to be developed.&#13;
&#13;
         The other dimension of the task at hand is mainstreaming civil society support within&#13;
World Bank practice. Although there is clear awareness within the World Bank of the potential&#13;
role of civil society in the development process, there is a need to incorporate it more fully into&#13;
the policy and operational work of World Bank staff. The point is how to make World Bank&#13;
support for civil society a process, not an event. The issue has been the topic of much discussion&#13;
and analysis within the World Bank, particularly after the World Bank Board's 1994 endorsement&#13;
of the final report and action plan of the Participatory Development Learning Group (PDLG),&#13;
The World Bank and Participation.30&#13;
&#13;
         The present paper has highlighted two operational instruments that the World Bank has&#13;
already made heavy use of in recent years and through which assistance can be channeled on a&#13;
regular basis: social investment funds and Community-Driven Development projects. The paper&#13;
also makes reference to another important channel for reaching civil society: the training programs&#13;
of the World Bank Institute, and in particular, those of its Community Empowerment and Social&#13;
Inclusion Learning Program (CESI), a program designed to educate decision makers about the&#13;
principles of civic engagement and to increase the capacity of local organizations to spearhead their&#13;
own development.&#13;

            The World Bank and civil society
            development : exploring two courses of action for capacity building
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In recent decades the World Bank has
            significantly broadened its dialogue and lines of
            collaboration with civil society organizations and advocated
            the concept of participation by beneficiaries in government
            projects. Its role in the promotion of autonomous capacity
            among civil society organizations has been more limited. The
            analysis focuses especially on the role played by social
            investment funds in both of these lines of action.
            Community-Driven Development programs are another major
            operational channel that the World Bank has used to support
            civil society. These operations entail a high degree of
            beneficiary participation aimed at giving communities
            significant control over decisions on project selection and
            the use of resources. The report underscores the fact that
            women are the prime generators of civic action at the micro
            level, and as such can make a significant contribution to
            furthering collective action focused on community
            objectives. The report suggests that a strategy for taking
            advantage of women's potential in the development field
            can begin by expanding government operations in areas where
            women have comparative advantage.
