MOLDOVA&#13;
GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
1.1   Situated between Ukraine and Romania, Moldova is the second smallest country in the Former&#13;
Soviet Union. Over 50% of its ethnically diverse population of 4.4 million live in rural areas.&#13;
Agriculture and agro-processing continue to dominate the national economy, accounting for nearly 60%&#13;
of GDP.&#13;
1.2    CounLry Context. Serious terms of trade shocks, armed conflict and a series of natural&#13;
calamities caused a precipitous decline in national production and living standards in Moldova during&#13;
the first half of the 1990s. Between 1991 and 1994 output and real wages fell by 60 percent, while&#13;
employment decreased from over 2 million in 1991 to around 1.7 million in 1994.&#13;
1.3   In 1993, the Government of Moldova initiated a vigorous and quite successful macro-economic&#13;
stabilization program. Tight monetary policy, the introduction of a new, convertible currency and&#13;
significant reductions in the budget deficit resulted in a sharp decline in inflation (from almost 2000%&#13;
in 1992 to 15.1% in 1996). Coupled with recently introduced structural reforms, particularly in the&#13;
enterprise sector, the Government's stabilization program appears to have led to a slowdown in the&#13;
precipitous decline in national production during 1995. Preliminary figures for 1996, however, suggest&#13;
a renewed downturn in GDP growth. To strengthen the gains achieved through the macro-economic&#13;
stabilization program, significant further structural reforms are needed in the years to come, both in the&#13;
productive and social sectors.&#13;
1.4   Sectoral Background. Although education has traditionally been a national priority, the&#13;
education system left behind by more than four decades of central planning is largely inadequate to&#13;
effectively prepare the future work force for the demands of a market economy. Curricula, the&#13;
approach to teaching and learning, and didactic materials need to be substantially upgraded to ensure&#13;
that the education system meets the demands posed by new social and economic realities.&#13;
1.5   The need to curb public expenditures resulted in a significant reduction in public expenditures&#13;
allocated to education over the past few years. As a result, education spending has been largely limited&#13;
to salaries and utilities, with minimal, if any, amounts left for textbooks, pedagogical materials, teacher&#13;
training and often badly needed capital repairs. The lack of resources has thus prevented the&#13;
Government from effectively implementing education reforms needed to adapt the system to new social&#13;
and economic realities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
B. The Education Sector&#13;
1.6    With the adoption of a new education law in 19951, Moldova has set the stage to reform its&#13;
education system -- bringing it more in line with the European systems -- and to revise the approach to&#13;
education in response to the new demands on the system.&#13;
1.7    Structure. The new system provides for one year of mandatory pre-school, followed by four&#13;
years of primary and five years of gymnasium schooling. Upon completion of this mandatory 10-year&#13;
general education program, students will have the option to continue in an upper secondary track for&#13;
another three years or a flexible 1.5 - to 5-year vocational education track with three completion levels&#13;
or exit points (Annex I). Full implementation of this new structure is planned over the next 10 years.&#13;
1.8    During the transition period, the new system will gradually gain importance, as the old system&#13;
will be phased out. Mandatory general education will occur along the lines outlined above, but&#13;
voluntary upper secondary education will be ensured through various alternatives:  (i) general&#13;
secondary school with the new lyceums covering grades 10-12 and terninating with the baccalaureate&#13;
examinations and with the traditional 11-year comprehensive schools; (ii) vocational secondary&#13;
education ensured by technical/vocational secondary schools (lasting 2-3 years), technical secondary&#13;
colleges (lasting 3 years) and apprentice schools (Annex I).&#13;
1.9    Higher education is ensured through a combination of public and private universities,&#13;
politechnicums and colleges. The overall level of education in Moldova is quite high by international&#13;
standards. According to the last population census (1989), about 10% of the population aged 14 or&#13;
more had enjoyed a higher education and 45% had completed upper secondary school.&#13;
1.10   Enrollments, Moldova's current education system (excluding Transnistria 2) consists of over&#13;
3,300 educational establishments and 77,500 teaching staff serving almost 922,000 students. Eighteen&#13;
percent of the student body is enrolled in pre-school, 29% in primary school, 34% in lower secondary&#13;
school (gyrnnasium), 6% in upper secondary school, 4% in vocational training schools, 3% in colleges&#13;
and technical schools and 5% in higher education establishments. About 75% of general education&#13;
students study in Romanian language schools, while the remainder study in minority schools (Russian,&#13;
Ukrainian, Gagauzian and Bulgarian), of which the Russian language schools are by far the most&#13;
important (accounting for over 50% of the minority student body).&#13;
1.11   Like in many other transition economies, there has been a continuous shift away from&#13;
vocational/technical and towards general education at the upper secondary level. The number of&#13;
students per 10,000 inhabitants enrolled in vocational/technical schools and colleges has decreased by&#13;
over one third over the past ten years. Over the past three years alone, the number of new enrollments&#13;
in vocational technical schools declined by over 14%, while that of students continuing with upper&#13;
general education increased by almost 10 percent.&#13;
The Education Law adopted in 1995 sets the stage for education reformn in Moldova and defines the new&#13;
structure of the education system (see para. 1.33).&#13;
2 The status of Transnistira within Moldova has not yet been settled. The mainly Russian speaking Transnistria&#13;
region has set up its own Government which does not report to the Moldovan Central Government.&#13;
Consequently, the education system in Transnistria does not fall under the control of the Moldovan Ministry&#13;
of Education, Youth, and Sports (MEYS) with the exception of a small number of Romanian speaking&#13;
schools which are supported by the Moldovan MEYS.&#13;

1.12   Performance Indicators. Repetition rates appear to be low in Moldova, with over 95% of pupils&#13;
in all grades of compulsory and secondary education reported to be in that grade for the first time.&#13;
Dropout rates are reported as being equally low. Virtually 100% of the age cohort complete mandatory&#13;
general education (grade 9), while somewhat below 50% of the age cohort continue upper secondary&#13;
education and 35% continue with technical education. Participation in higher (university) education is&#13;
still relatively low (about 10%), though increasing. No reliable data exist on the overall effectiveness&#13;
of the Moldovan education system and on student achievement.&#13;
1.13   Teachers and Teacher Training. Pre-service teacher training is currently ensured through two&#13;
avenues: pre-school and primary school teachers follow a 4-5 year course at a specialized teacher&#13;
training college after completing 9th grade. Secondary school teachers follow a 4-5 year course at one&#13;
of several higher education establishments where they specialize in one or two subject matters and also&#13;
follow  some pedagogical training.   Most teachers of 'practical' subjects graduated  from&#13;
vocational/technical schools have no subject-based higher education or pedagogical training. The&#13;
Ministry is reconsidering the organization of pre-service teacher training to bring the system more in&#13;
line with most OECD countries, where specialized upper secondary school training for primary school&#13;
teachers has been replaced with higher education training.&#13;
1.14   The National Institute for Teacher Training (INPCD) is in charge of in-service teacher training.&#13;
In principle, all teachers are obliged to follow an in-service refresher course every five years. However,&#13;
resource and capacity constraints have prevented full realization of this requirement. Because neither&#13;
pre-service nor in-service teachers training has provided teachers with exposure to alternative&#13;
methodologies and approaches to learning now predominant in most developed countries, in-service&#13;
training will need to be adjusted and reformed accordingly to help improve educational quality in the&#13;
years to come.&#13;
1.15   The need to allocate resources more efficiently will require increases in the currently low&#13;
student/teacher ratio, particularly at the secondary and vocational training level and to increase the&#13;
currently low teaching load. At the same time efforts will need to be made to bring teacher salaries,&#13;
which currently average only 55% of salaries in industry, more in line with those in other sectors, so as&#13;
to stem the drain of teachers in high demand areas (e.g. foreign languages) into other occupations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
1.16   Education Sector Management. Education management is still very centralized in Moldova.&#13;
The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports (MEYS)3 is responsible for all major aspects of&#13;
education. Its organizational structure includes departments for specific aspects/levels of education&#13;
(e.g. pre-school, general education, vocational education, higher education, post-university education)&#13;
and a network of semi-autonomous institutes, such as the Institute for Psychological and Pedagogical&#13;
Studies (IPPS) or the National Institute for Teacher Training (INPCD). The Ministry develops&#13;
education policy, manages the preparation of new curricula and approves the latter, prepares and&#13;
approves all assessment and examination materials, and manages the production of all textbooks.&#13;
1.17   The Ministry directly manages only a limited number of educational institutions. Although it&#13;
oversees all pre-school and   general education establishments, the latter are financially and&#13;
administratively the responsibility of local governments and fall under the auspices of rayon education&#13;
directorates. The latter, however, are dependent on the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports and&#13;
their flexibility is thus limited. The Ministry also oversees all vocational training schools, 35% of&#13;
colleges and 45% of higher education establishments and a limited number of special education&#13;
establishments and boarding schools. The remainder of colleges and higher education establishments&#13;
are under the administrative and financial responsibility of various sectoral ministries.&#13;
1.18   Education Sector Financing. The high priority which Moldova accords to education is reflected&#13;
in the important share of public expenditures and of GDP which go to education. Over the last three&#13;
years, education expenditures have averaged almost 22% of total public expenditures and 6.7% of GDP&#13;
(8.9% of GDP excluding Transnistria)4, compared to 4.8% of GDP and 12% of total expenditures in&#13;
OECD countries. Despite efforts to protect education sector expenditures during the time of necessary&#13;
budget cuts, real expenditures in the education sector dropped significantly during the transition period&#13;
(17% between 1993 and 1995 alone).&#13;
1.19   Over two-thirds of public expenditures for education are covered by the budgets of local&#13;
governments.  While the state budget covers vocational, technical and higher education, local&#13;
governments are responsible for pre-school and general education, except for boarding schools and&#13;
other institutions for children with special needs. The central government also covers the development&#13;
cost of curriculum and teaching materials, including textbook production, for all education levels (these&#13;
expenditures have become minimal over the past few years). Capital investments must be approved by&#13;
the central government on a case by case basis. Only upon approval of a particular project are funds&#13;
transferred from the central to the local government. The share of local governments' contribution to&#13;
education expenditures has increased by almost 20% since 1992, mainly because of the declining&#13;
importance of central government-financed vocational training expenditures.&#13;
After January 15, 1997. the Ministry of Education was merged with two other ministries and is now officially&#13;
called the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports.&#13;
Education expenditures and other public expenditures exclude Transnistria. Transnistria should also be&#13;
excluded from GDP when education expenditures are compared to GDP.&#13;

1.20   Resource constraints have led to a situation where salaries, school maintenance (essentially&#13;
utilities), and food expenditures account for close to 90% of education expenditures, leaving minimal, if&#13;
any amounts for textbooks, pedagogical materials, in-service teacher training and often badly needed&#13;
capital repairs. As a result, there has been a considerable shortage of textbooks and other pedagogical&#13;
materials in schools over the past few years and even minimal capital repairs which would have&#13;
allowed energy efficiency improvements that can cut down on utility costs. Perpetuation of this&#13;
situation is likely to weaken the educational system's effectiveness and severely damage the capital&#13;
stock.&#13;

1.21   Over the past four years Moldova has increasingly shifted the focus of its educational&#13;
expenditures away from technical and vocational towards general education. This is a sensible strategy,&#13;
given that resources are severely constrained and returns to general education (particularly lower&#13;
grades) have traditionally been higher than those to technical and higher education. General education&#13;
(grades 1-12) now accounts for almost 60% of education expenditures, pre-school accounts for a high&#13;
20 percent. Vocational, college and higher education account for 7%, 5%, and 10% of total&#13;
expenditures, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. Main Issues and Constraints&#13;
1.22   Approach to Teaching and Learning.  The approach to teaching and learning currently&#13;
predominant in Moldova's classrooms and also reflected in the current curricula and teacher training&#13;
courses is a legacy of the past and differs significantly from that in most developed countries. Curricula&#13;
as well as examinations are mainly content- and knowledge-based; students are expected to learn and&#13;
recite facts rather than build up learning and critical thinking skills. The teaching process is mainly&#13;
authoritarian and frontal. The teacher-centered approach, whereby a teacher "lectures" students, is the&#13;
traditional teaching method, while little attention is paid to discovery and group work, problem-solving,&#13;
discussion or project work which would further student initiative, interaction and critical thinking. To&#13;
effectively prepare the future labor force to enter an increasingly flexible but demanding labor market,&#13;
it is critical that the education system teaches students more cognitive and social skills such as creative&#13;
thinking, problem solving, decision making and responding to unanticipated problems.&#13;
1.23   The knowledge-based approach also strongly affects teacher training. The curriculum for&#13;
teacher training is very content- and knowledge-based and taught at a highly theoretical level, while&#13;
more practical applications such as classroom management and organization, differential pedagogy,&#13;
group work, and conflict resolution are left out completely. The content of academic subjects is&#13;
essentially limited to a study of the subject itself, while little attention is paid to issues related to&#13;
teaching and learning the subject.&#13;
1.24   Curriculum. The curriculum inherited from the past no longer corresponds to Moldova's social&#13;
and economic realities and needs substantial revision, both in terms of content and in terms of&#13;
approaches to teaching and learning. The Institute for Pedagogical and Psychological Studies (IPPS)&#13;
has started to revise the curricula for general education. However, the new curricula developed so far&#13;
suffer from a lack of vertical and horizontal coherence because there is no structure that would allow&#13;
coordination among individual curriculum developers, nor any review which would ensure inter-and&#13;
trans-disciplinary coherence. In addition, curriculum development remains a very closed process with&#13;
little, if any, input or feedback from key stakeholders, such as teachers, school inspectors, parents or the&#13;
academic community. Thus, there is a pressing need to revise the approach to and processes for&#13;
curriculum development to allow for improved coherence and increased stakeholder participation.&#13;
1.25   Learning Assessment. Although Moldovan students are currently administered a battery of&#13;
control, promotion and graduation tests throughout their education, there is essentially no valid&#13;
information generated on student achievement and the performance of the education system as a whole.&#13;
This is due to a number of key shortcomings of the current learning assessment system, such as: (i)&#13;
students are over-tested but under-assessed in terms of formative information and acquisition of flexible&#13;
skills; (ii) examinations and classroom tests are heavily content- and knowledge-based; (iii) centrally-&#13;
set written examinations are of low technical quality, lacking face validity, reliability and comparability&#13;
in terms of difficulty levels; (iv) testing and scoring are not developed to modern standards, as delivery&#13;
of hand-written and oral examinations create uneven testing conditions for candidates; (v) examination&#13;
results are not collected and analyzed; (vi) there is no identifiable "cadre" of trained specialists with&#13;
adequate time and resources to develop modern assessment types; and (vii) there are no clear lines of&#13;
accountability for examination quality within the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports.&#13;
1.26   Substantial revision of the assessment and examination system  is needed to develop a&#13;
mechanism which not only certifies students, but also provides a valid assessment of their acquired&#13;
knowledge and skills and at the same time provides feedback on the overall quality of the education&#13;
system. Emphasis should be placed on limiting the number and improving the quality and validity of&#13;
national examinations. Assessment objectives should be integrated into the new curriculum. A small&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
cadre of specialists capable of developing, administering and subsequently analyzing results of&#13;
examinations which objectively assess student achievement must be developed.&#13;
1.27   Textbooks. The profound political changes in the early 1990s left the Moldovan education&#13;
system confronted with the need to replace previous, often ideologized, textbooks. Mainly due to&#13;
resource constraints, these replacements have so far taken place on a piecemeal basis, with the result&#13;
that there remains a significant shortage of textbooks in schools and those textbooks which are currently&#13;
in use often do not correspond to the new needs of the education system. The introduction of new&#13;
curricula will require the parallel introduction of new textbooks, in sufficient quantities to allow for&#13;
effective teaching and learning.&#13;
1.28   Development of new textbooks, which has been extremely limited due to resource constraints,&#13;
occurs under a rather closed system. Authors are hand picked by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and&#13;
Sports and are largely limited to staff at the Institute for Pedagogical and Psychological Studies. In&#13;
most cases, the same people who write the curriculum also write the textbook. Publication is largely&#13;
ensured by the State Textbook Publisher, which is financially and managerially autonomous and does&#13;
not obtain any subsidies. Although there is a growing number of local private publishers, their&#13;
experience in textbook publishing remains extremely limited, as they have not had access to Ministry of&#13;
Education, Youth, and Sports contracts.&#13;
1.29   A fundamental problem in the supply of textbooks is the lack of a sustainable textbook&#13;
financing mechanism. The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports no longer has the budgetary&#13;
resources to guarantee adequate annual supplies nor development of new materials needed for a modern&#13;
education system. While external funding can help mitigate the immediate crisis by supporting the&#13;
development of new textbooks, it will be necessary to introduce a cost recovery mechanism that permits&#13;
books to be regularly reprinted as the need arises.&#13;
1.30   Resource Allocation. While the Moldovan education system is affected by significant resource&#13;
constraints, there is also a clear need to improve the efficiency of sectoral resource allocation.&#13;
Student/teacher ratios (national average of 13) and teachers' working hours are low, the ratio of non-&#13;
teaching staff to teaching staff is relatively high, vocational training students get free meals or stipends&#13;
irrespective of performance or income. Day care at early ages is provided free of charge, except for&#13;
some cost recovery for meals. To date practically no efforts have been made to introduce significant&#13;
cost recovery measures and, hence, increase private sector participation in education finance. The&#13;
Government is aiming to tackle these issues through efficiency enhancing measures such as a gradual&#13;
increase of the student-teacher ratio, a continued reallocation of resources away from vocational and&#13;
higher education towards general education, and increased involvement of the private sector in&#13;
education finance.&#13;
1.31   The proposed project is designed to help the Government implement the reforms needed in the&#13;
areas of curriculum and teaching materials development, learning assessment and in-service teacher&#13;
training, so as to help bring the Moldovan education system more in line with those in market&#13;
economies. It will also support the establishment and implementation of a cost recovery system for&#13;
textbooks. The resource allocation issue is being tackled through a continuous policy dialogue with the&#13;
Government, including work carried out in preparation of the proposed project and the Public&#13;
Expenditure Review. The sectoral development policy letter which the Ministry of Education, Youth,&#13;
and Sports provided to the Bank during negotiations outlined the Government plans to tackle resource&#13;
allocation issues. In addition, resources have been allocated under the proposed project to carry out&#13;
studies in the area of education sector management and resource allocation in view of a possible future&#13;
project which would support reforms in this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
D. Government Strategy&#13;
1.32   The Government is fully aware of the need to reform the education system to bring it more in&#13;
line with those in market economies. The Government has already developed an overall education&#13;
reform strategy which has been adapted by the Parliament. Three key documents reflect the anchor&#13;
points of the new strategy: a concept paper, adopted by Parliament in December 1994; the new&#13;
Education Law, adopted by Parliament in July 1995; and the National Program for Education&#13;
Development (1995-2000) which is currently being revised.&#13;
1.33   The core components of education reform, as reflected in these documents, are:&#13;
* reform of the education system structure as described in para. 1.7;&#13;
* a major overhaul of the education program (curricula, teaching materials, textbooks, and&#13;
teaching methodology) at all levels to adjust the approach to teaching and its contents to&#13;
new demands on the education system, with particular focus on formnative education;&#13;
*  reform of teacher training and re-training to equip teachers with the necessary skills to&#13;
implement new approaches to learning and teaching and to expose them to modern&#13;
methodologies used around the world;&#13;
-  introduction of new education standards and modem mechanisms to assess student learning;&#13;
* development of a modern educational management system, allowing for increased flexibility&#13;
and more efficient use of resources;&#13;
- increased role of private educational establishments; and&#13;
* an increase in the resources allocated to education to improve conditions of service for&#13;
teachers and raise sectoral investments needed to implement the reforms.&#13;
1.34   Although these points present a good basis for the reforms necessary to upgrade the education&#13;
system, detailed formulation and actual implementation of the reforms still lie ahead in many areas.&#13;
The proposed project would help to further define detailed reforms and establish some of the&#13;
institutional frameworks and processes necessary for successful implementation of the reform program.&#13;
E. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.35   The Bank's assistance strategy to Moldova initially focused on a response to the drought of&#13;
1992 (US$26 million - Ln. No. 3569), followed by a Rehabilitation Loan (US$60 million - Ln. No.&#13;
3653), a Structural Adjustrnent Loan (US$60 million - Ln. No. 3815) and a Pre-Export Guarantee&#13;
Facility (US$30 million - Ln. No. 3851) in the period 1993-95. While the Bank's 1996 Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS) has identified a further need for structural adjustment support, it has also&#13;
pointed out that the Bank's focus over the years to come will increasingly need to shift towards&#13;
investment operations in key areas such as agriculture, energy and the social sectors to help broaden the&#13;
reform effort. Consequently, recently approved Bank projects include an Agriculture Project (US$10&#13;
million - Ln. No. 40110), an Energy Sector Project (US$10 million - Ln. No. 40200) and a Private&#13;
Sector Development Project (US$35 million - Ln. Nos. 39770/39771).&#13;
1.36   Although reforms are planned in all social sectors, the degree to which these changes are&#13;
embedded in a well-defined long-termn strategy varies. Strategic reform plans are furthest advanced in&#13;
the education sector; while reforms in health and social protection still remain to be formulated. Taking&#13;
into account the degree of preparation of reform plans and foreign assistance already in place in other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
parts of the social sectors, the CAS highlights the education sector as the most suitable choice for Bank&#13;
support at this stage.&#13;
1.37   Reforming Moldova's education system so that it can adequately respond to the demands of the&#13;
new social, political and economic environment will be key to helping Moldova successfully complete&#13;
the transition to a market economy. Yet, it is virtually impossible to finance the required education&#13;
sector reforms with the limited budgetary resources available. To date, external support to the sector&#13;
has been very limited and piecemeal, preventing Moldova from successfully carrying out the necessary&#13;
reforms. The proposed project emerged as a priority during discussions with the Government in&#13;
October 1995, when a Bank mission examined priorities in social sectors.&#13;
1.38   Until preparation of the proposed project was initiated in January 1996, the Bank's involvement&#13;
in the sector had been limited to a sectoral analysis carried out in the framework of an overall&#13;
assessment of social sector needs in 1993. Since project preparation has been initiated, the Bank has&#13;
been involved in a continuous dialogue with the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports and other key&#13;
Ministries (Economy and Finance) on education reform issues. This dialogue was further supported&#13;
and expanded during the recently completed Public Expenditure Review, which included a detailed&#13;
analysis of education sector resource allocation issues.&#13;
1.39   As the CAS points out, the Bank's strategy in the education sector in Moldova is to use the&#13;
preparation and subsequent implementation of this proposed first project to initiate a long-term&#13;
dialogue and to reach agreement on comprehensive sector reform focusing on a medium term human&#13;
resource development strategy to support private sector development and to improve the sector's&#13;
performance. The proposed project will thus support the first phase of the Government's education&#13;
reform efforts and focus on reforms which largely need to be initiated by the center, such as national&#13;
curriculum, assessment and textbook reforms. It is expected that the dialogue and cooperation will&#13;
continue beyond the implementation of this proposed project, possibly with later support for reforms at&#13;
the upper secondary and/or vocational training levels and with the implementation of a comprehensive&#13;
education sector management reform. The proposed project would thus allocate resources for studies to&#13;
help define the reform program in these areas in detail so that its implementation could be supported by&#13;
future Bank assisted projects.&#13;
1.40   The proposed project has been prepared with financial assistance provided through a Policy and&#13;
Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund from the Japanese Government and through the&#13;
Netherlands Trust Fund for the Social Sectors in Moldova. Project preparation focused heavily on&#13;
participation by staff of the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports, as well as those in the&#13;
community associated with definition and subsequent implementation of education sector reforms.&#13;
Throughout project preparation, the Bank maintained close coordination with other donors supporting&#13;
the sector. UNICEF is supporting pre-school reforms, the Soros Foundation is providing limited&#13;
support with textbooks in the humanities and foreign languages, particularly at the lyceum level, while&#13;
the European Union and GTZ are providing some assistance in the areas of vocational training, labor&#13;
market and higher education.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Background&#13;
2.1    The proposed project is the first Bank-supported operation in Moldova's social sectors and in&#13;
the education sector. Project design has deliberately been kept simple; project interventions are limited&#13;
to supporting reforms in mandatory general education through four closely interlinked components.&#13;
The choice of supporting reforms in general education is motivated by three main factors: (i) the&#13;
Government's decision to initiate reform at this level because curriculum reform has already been&#13;
started, but slowed down due to fiscal constraints; (ii) economic returns from investments in general&#13;
education have always been significantly higher than those at other education levels5; and, (iii) general&#13;
education reform is less dependent on the pace of reform in other sectors.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
2.2    The project aims at supporting the first phase of Moldova's education sector reforms, focusing&#13;
on mandatory general education. The project's key objective is to modernize and improve the quality&#13;
of primary and lower secondary education through improved curricula, new textbooks, in-service&#13;
teacher training, and a modern assessment system. While the project will introduce innovative&#13;
approaches in each of these areas and involve some institutional changes in the Ministry of Education,&#13;
Youth, and Sports, it is deliberately designed to build on the sector's existing labor force and not&#13;
expand employment in or outside the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports. It largely builds on&#13;
existing institutions and the achievements of Moldova's education system to date.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
2.3    The proposed General Education Project comprises four components: curriculum development,&#13;
textbook production and financing, learning assessment, and in-service teacher training.&#13;
2.4    Curriculum Development Component (US$0.64 million, net of taxes, or 4% of base costs).&#13;
This component aims at supporting the Government's efforts to revise the entire curriculum for&#13;
mandatory general education, so as to ensure that the curricula correspond to new demands on the&#13;
education system and espouse a modern and methodologically improved approach to teaching and&#13;
learning.&#13;
2.5    The component comprises (i) the establishment of an integrated institutional structure for&#13;
curriculum development and assessmentlevaluation so as to promote cohesion in policy and activities&#13;
(Annex II), (ii) the development and establishment of updated subject curricula for grades 1 - 9, and&#13;
(iii) support to teachers with the implementation of the new curriculum.&#13;
2.6    The main innovation under this component is that the curriculum development process would&#13;
become significantly more broad based and participatory than it currently is and would, thus, ensure&#13;
increased stakeholder participation. Curricula would be drafted by working groups consisting of&#13;
curriculum development specialists from the Institute of Pedagogical and Psychological Studies, subject&#13;
matter specialists from academia, classroom teachers and rayon education inspectors/methodologists.&#13;
Draft curricula would be reviewed by a coordination and curriculum evaluation committee, composed&#13;
5See for examnple, George Psacharopoulos, "Returns to Investment in Education: A Global Update," Working&#13;
Paper No. 1067, (Washington, D.C.: The World Bank, 1993).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
of a combination of subject matter specialists and teachers. Besides reviewing curricula for their&#13;
methodological, pedagogical and subject matter adequacy, coordination committees would be&#13;
responsible for ensuring vertical and horizontal coherence in the curricula. Before negotiations, the&#13;
Borrower submitted satisfactory evidence to the Bank that the new institutional structure for curriculum&#13;
development and learning assessment had been established&#13;
2.7    Each draft curriculum would undergo a broad based consultation process, so as to obtain&#13;
feedback from rayon education directorate subject matter specialists, teachers, schools administrators&#13;
and other interested parties. Feedback from the consultation process would be integrated in subsequent&#13;
drafts of the curriculum. Once adopted by the coordination and curriculum evaluation committee, the&#13;
new curriculum would be submitted to the newly established National Curriculum and Assessment&#13;
Council (NCAC) for further review. The latter would either send the curriculum back for further&#13;
revision or recommend its adoption to the Minister of Education, Youth, and Sports. At the end of the&#13;
project, a total of about 134 subject grade curricula would have been developed, adopted, and&#13;
introduced in schools.&#13;
2.8    The revised curricula would espouse modern approaches to teaching and learning and contain&#13;
revised contents, and key learning and assessment objectives. Together with the re-training of teachers&#13;
and new textbooks, they would be key to transforming Moldova's education system so that it can&#13;
provide students with the basic skills needed to function effectively in a modern market economy.&#13;
2.9    The component would also support introduction of the new curricula through the production of&#13;
supporting materials for teachers by the curriculum development working groups, contribution of the&#13;
curriculum development working groups to in-service teacher training, and participation of curriculum&#13;
development working group and coordination committee members in the textbook manuscript&#13;
evaluation committees. The project would also provide technology and science related equipment&#13;
relevant to the introduction of the new curricula in a number of pilot schools. The detailed list of&#13;
equipment would be drawn up by the curriculum development working groups with concurrence by the&#13;
World Bank. This pilot activity would test and establish the basis of minimum equipment necessary to&#13;
teach effectively those subjects requiring equipment before embarking on large scale investments&#13;
across the country. Bank approval of the proposed equipment list and the selection criteria for pilot&#13;
schools would be a condition of disbursement of the funds for these equipment.&#13;
2.10   The project would finance training and technical assistance for all bodies involved in&#13;
curriculum development, equipment, materials, development costs, including stakeholder consultations,&#13;
production of supporting materials for teachers, interim and final publication and dissemination of new&#13;
curricula, and, science and technology equipment in pilot schools.&#13;
2.11   Learning Assessment Component (US$0.82 million, net of taxes, or 5% of base costs). This&#13;
component aims at upgrading Moldova's assessment and examinations system into a national system of&#13;
assessment and evaluation capable of monitoring and providing feedback on the quality of the&#13;
education system.&#13;
2.12   The component would support the development of an improved assessment and examinations&#13;
system in five key areas: (i) integrating assessment objectives into the new curriculum; (ii) improving&#13;
key national examinations at grades 4 and 9 to monitor student performance and the impact of the new&#13;
curriculum and textbooks on learning outcomes; (iii) developing and disseminating to teachers&#13;
packages of exemplary assessment materials for key subjects in grades 1-9; (iv) training central trainers&#13;
in the use of these materials; and (v) conducting a sample based survey of student achievements under&#13;
the current system against which student performance under the new curriculum could be compared&#13;
towards the end of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.13   The new integrated institutional structure for curriculum and assessment development will&#13;
ensure integration and close coordination of curriculum and learning assessment development. In&#13;
particular, the new structure would ensure that learning assessment standards for each subject and level&#13;
are in line with standards of the national curriculum, and that there is coherence of assessment packages&#13;
and formats across subjects and educational levels.&#13;
2.14   Improvement of the system of examinations and assessment would occur at two levels: (i)&#13;
streamlining and upgrading of key national examinations6; and (ii) strengthening of classroom based&#13;
diagnostic and formative testing. The overall goal for national examinations would be to ensure that by&#13;
the end of the project every student in Moldova would be given his/her own copy of an examination&#13;
paper which is carefully designed and constructed, linked to national standards and curriculum&#13;
objectives, and composed of questions which ask for more than recall of factual knowledge. Improved&#13;
school based assessment would be achieved by providing teachers with supporting materials which&#13;
outline alternative ways of assessment and by including a module on modern school based assessment&#13;
in the project supported in-service teacher training component.&#13;
2.15   To improve the national system of examinations, the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports&#13;
would set up a small but specialized Department for Examinations and Evaluation (DEE) in charge of&#13;
development, administration and evaluation of national examinations. The unit would also contribute&#13;
to the development of materials for and support teacher training in assessment under the project's&#13;
teacher training component. The unit would be staffed through redeployment and training of existing&#13;
ministerial staff.&#13;
2.16   The project would finance specialized local and international training for staff of the DEE and&#13;
those members of the curriculum development structure in charge of learning assessment, technical&#13;
assistance, equipment and materials for production of new examinations and supporting materials,&#13;
development and dissemination of supporting materials for the new assessment system, and the actual&#13;
production and administration of new national examinations for grades 4 and 9 during the initial years.&#13;
2.17   Teacher Training Component (US$3.34 million, net of taxes, or 20% of base costs). The new&#13;
curricula and teaching materials to be introduced will also require significant changes in the approach&#13;
to teaching and learning. In order for the new curricula to succeed, it will be necessary to provide all&#13;
teachers and school inspectors in charge of mandatory general education with specialized training. At&#13;
the same time it will be necessary to strengthen the rayon level support system for teachers. A total of&#13;
about 45,000 teachers would have to be trained over a period of five years.&#13;
2.18   The project would ensure that the training would draw on existing in- and pre-service teacher&#13;
training institutions to provide intensive residential training to selected inspectors, methodologists,&#13;
school directors and teachers from each rayon. Upon completion of their training, the latter would&#13;
serve as trainers for teachers in their respective rayons. Rather than attending residential centralized&#13;
training courses, teachers would thus attend courses at the rayon level. This approach would not only&#13;
allow for the most cost-effective use of resources, it would also ensure that rayon inspectors and&#13;
methodologists establish the necessary rapport with teachers to subsequently serve as resource persons&#13;
6 Under the new system of national examinations the number of national examinations would be reduced to cover&#13;
only key exit points: at the end of grade 4 achievements upon completion of primary school would be tested;&#13;
at the end of grade 9 achievements upon completion of mandatory general education would be tested. The&#13;
baccalaureate at the end of grade 12 would measure student achievement after voluntary higher secondary&#13;
education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
for questions related to the new curriculum and learning assessment system. Each teacher would attend&#13;
an initial training course and a refresher course after two years.&#13;
2.19   The project would finance technical assistance, development and dissemination of training&#13;
materials, development and implementation of centralized courses for trainers and decentralized&#13;
courses for teachers, equipment necessary to develop and hold training courses for key central training&#13;
institutions and rayon education directorates.&#13;
2.20   Textbook Development and Financing (US$11.50 million, net of taxes or 69% of base costs).&#13;
The objective of this component is twofold: (i) to facilitate the introduction of the new curricula by&#13;
providing schools with an adequate number of textbooks in line with the new curricula for core subjects&#13;
and (ii) to help develop a sustainable system of textbook financing that would help guarantee&#13;
availability of textbooks upon project completion.&#13;
2.21   The project would finance the production of new textbooks and, where appropriate, teacher&#13;
guides, in the mother tongue for core subjects for grades 3-9. Books for the first two grades of primary&#13;
education are being financed by Government and other donor funds prior to the project start-up.&#13;
Textbooks would be procured through a system of competitive bidding which would combine&#13;
competition for authorship with competition for publication, thus requiring potential authors to work&#13;
directly with publishers and substantially increasing the pool of authors from the current system where&#13;
authors are hand picked in a rather non-transparent system. Book manuscripts would be evaluated by a&#13;
Manuscript Evaluation Committee (MEC), comprising representatives from curriculum development,&#13;
teacher training and teachers (Annex V). The project would provide training for publishers, Ministry of&#13;
Education, Youth, and Sports staff and Manuscript and Bid Evaluation Committees' members in&#13;
competitive bidding for textbook publishing and in principles of publishing textbooks in a competitive&#13;
environment.&#13;
2.22   To avoid a serious shortfall of textbooks in mandatory general education upon project&#13;
completion, the project would also support the introduction of a cost recovery system for textbooks&#13;
(Annex V). Under the system, students would be charged a book rental fee for a set of textbooks. The&#13;
latter would be structured to allow cost recovery over the life of a textbook (four years for primary&#13;
school books and five years for secondary school books). Fees would be collected by each school and&#13;
then transferred through a local bank to a centrally managed book fund. Rayon education directorates&#13;
would keep detailed records of the amounts collected and paid into the fund by school by grade and&#13;
ensure that each school is informed about the amounts to be collected by grade prior to the start of each&#13;
school year. The fund would then be used to finance reprints and re-editions as books would need to be&#13;
replaced. At current prices, the proposed annual rental fee for a set of primary school textbooks would&#13;
be between 17 and 20 lei per student per year and between 22 and 29 lei per student per year for&#13;
secondary school textbooks. Poor families with several school aged children would be provided with a&#13;
budget financed voucher entitling them to a discounted book rental fee.  Because of targeting&#13;
difficulties and moral hazard problems, the budget ceiling for vouchers would initially be established&#13;
based on the number of families with several children currently entitled to a state benefit under the&#13;
existing child compensation system, but the actual identification of children to receive assistance would&#13;
be left to rayons and individual schools. Before negotiations, the Borrower submitted to the Bank for&#13;
review and comments a detailed description of the operations of the textbook rental scheme agreed&#13;
upon by the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Education, Youth, and Sports including the draft&#13;
7 Grades 3 and 5 manuscripts are already well advanced. Therefore competitive bidding would only be applied to&#13;
publication of textbooks for these grades, but for all other grades competition would also involve author&#13;
selection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
Government decree and implementing regulations for the establishment and operation of the rental&#13;
scheme. As a condition of loan effectiveness, the Borrower would provide satisfactory evidence to the&#13;
Bank that the textbook financing mechanism has been adopted by the Government after Bank review&#13;
and comments. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that the textbook&#13;
financing scheme would be implemented and the textbook fund account maintained in a commercial&#13;
bank satisfactory to the Bank throughout the project implementation period, and that the Bank would be&#13;
provided within six months after the end of each fiscal year a copy of the yearly audit report of the&#13;
textbookfund carried out by independent auditors.&#13;
2.23   The project would finance development, evaluation, production and distribution of new&#13;
textbooks and training and technical assistance for Ministry staff, textbook evaluation committees and&#13;
publishers in competitive bidding procedures. It would also finance technical assistance, training,&#13;
computer equipment and public information campaign expenditures necessary for the introduction of&#13;
the new textbook financing scheme.&#13;
2.24   Project Management and Implementation (US$0.37 million, net of taxes, or 2% of base costs).&#13;
To manage and coordinate overall project implementation, a project management unit (PMU),&#13;
consisting of a Project Director, a procurement officer, a translator/administrative assistant and a part-&#13;
time accountant would be established in the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports. The project&#13;
would finance technical assistance (a project implementation adviser for one year with possibility of an&#13;
additional year's extension if needed), equipment and incremental operating costs necessary for project&#13;
management, as well as studies required for the preparation of a possible future project.&#13;
D. Impact on Women, Environment, Poverty and Participation&#13;
2.25   Environmental Aspects. The proposed project's focus is on curriculum, learning assessment&#13;
and instructional materials development and does not involve any construction nor use of&#13;
environmentally hazardous materials. New curricula and teaching materials will include education in&#13;
environmental awareness. The project has therefore been assigned an environmental category C.&#13;
2.26  Impact on Women. Education access in Moldova is equitable. The reform would enhance&#13;
equitable educational access to women and new curricula are expected to promote equality of rights.&#13;
2.27 Poverty Alleviation. Although the proposed project does not directly focus on poverty&#13;
alleviation, it is expected to indirectly contribute to poverty alleviation by helping to improve the&#13;
country's human capital stock, necessary for sustainable long-term growth in the future.&#13;
2.28   Participation, Project preparation involved a wide range of stakeholders through participatory&#13;
workshops which sought feedback from the academic community, rayon education directorates, school&#13;
administrators and teachers on proposed project activities. Feedback from these workshops was&#13;
integrated into project design. During its implementation, the project will further broaden stakeholder&#13;
participation in the education reform process, particularly through a more participatory process for&#13;
curriculum development and open competition for textbook production.&#13;

A. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
3.1     Project Costs. Total project costs are estimated at US$21.6 million equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies and taxes. Detailed cost estimates are presented in Annex VIII. A summary of the cost&#13;
estimates by component and by expenditure category are provided below in Tables 3.1 and 3.2,&#13;
respectively.&#13;

Note: Totals may not be exact due to rounding errors.&#13;
3.2     Project cost estimates are based on October 1996 prices. Due to the evolving nature of the&#13;
Moldovan economy, all estimated costs are based on the US dollar. Physical contingencies of 10&#13;
percent were applied to the base costs except for the PMU. The following estimated world inflation&#13;
rates were used to adjust the costs during project implementation: 2.0% for 1997, 2.1% for 1998, 2.3%&#13;
for 1999, 2.4% for 2000, and 2.3% for 2001. The estimated total foreign cost is US$8.5 million.&#13;
Recurrent costs amount to US$0.27 million over the five year implementation period. Project&#13;
expenditures other than textbooks and technical assistance will be subject to VAT, customs duties and&#13;
fees, and social fund contributions, estimated at US$1.7 million over the five year period. These&#13;
expenses will be covered by the Government.&#13;
3.3    Prpject Financig. The proposed loan of US$16.8 million equivalent would finance about 84%&#13;
of the estimated total project cost (net of taxes) including 100% of foreign and 72% of local costs (see&#13;
Table 3.3 for details). The Government counterpart financing is US$4.9 million, including US$1.7&#13;
million for taxes and social fund contributions. Bilateral donors have been approached to provide grant&#13;
financing for the foreign technical assistance requirements. However, if no grant financing can be&#13;
secured, the technical assistance requirements would be financed from the loan proceeds. As a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness, the Borrower would provide evidence to the Bank that a project account&#13;
for counterpartfunding has been opened and an initial deposit equivalent to at least 3 months worth of&#13;
counterpart contributions including tax contributions has been deposited&#13;

3.4      Procurement Arrangements.   All procurement would  follow   World  Bank  procurement&#13;
guidelines. Procurement of goods financed with Bank loan funds would be carried out in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated January 1995 as&#13;
revised in January 1996 and August 1996. Consulting Services would be procured in accordance with&#13;
the Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency (August 1981). Standard Bank Bidding Documents would be used for ICB, integral or amended&#13;
as approved by the Bank. For national competitive bidding (NCB), bidding documents based on the&#13;
Bank's standard bidding documents, amended as necessary to local conditions and approved by the&#13;
Bank, would be used. The GPN was published in Development Business, No. 452, December 16,&#13;
1996.&#13;
3.5      Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). A Country Procurement Assessment Report&#13;
has not yet been carried out due to the lack of a clear legal and institutional framework for public&#13;
procurement in Moldova. A Country Procurement Strategy Paper is under preparation. A draft&#13;
national procurement law is being prepared with World Bank IDF grant assistance; the aim is to&#13;
stimulate more competition and transparency of the process, and to help establish sustainable&#13;
institutions to institutionalize this process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.6    The major procurement under this project would be textbooks and teacher guides. Because&#13;
individual contracts are expected to be small and the limited Moldovan textbook market is not likely to&#13;
be of interest to many international bidders, NCB procedures, acceptable to the Bank, would be used to&#13;
procure these items. These procedures will allow for a widely published and open competitive bidding&#13;
process in which domestic and foreign publishers will be eligible to participate on an equal basis after&#13;
pre-qualification. Bidding documents to be used for the procurement of textbooks and teacher guides&#13;
are based on the Bank's standard bidding document for the procurement of textbooks. For minority&#13;
schools, minority language editions will be published by translating Romanian language originals. If a&#13;
winning bidder for a book does not have the capacity to also provide the solicited language edition, the&#13;
Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports will buy the translation right and award the contract for the&#13;
corresponding language publication to another capable publisher. Since these contracts will be small&#13;
(about $42,000 per contract), contracts for publication of translated books would be awarded through&#13;
International Shopping procedures.&#13;
3.7    Implementing Agency. The PMU would be responsible for all procurement required under the&#13;
project. Local counterparts involved in project implementation have attended Bank procurement&#13;
training in the neighboring countries. In order to improve procurement effectiveness, standard bidding&#13;
documents acceptable to the Bank for the procurement of textbooks and teacher guides have been&#13;
prepared prior to project effectiveness. Furthermore, to augment the PMU's procurement capabilities,&#13;
the foreign project advisor would assist the procurement officer during the initial implementation&#13;
period.&#13;
3.8    Goods (US$11.8 million). Goods to be procured include computer systems, office and training&#13;
equipment, sundries, and textbooks and teaching materials. Procurement of office and training&#13;
equipment for the rayon education directorates in the aggregate amount of approximately US$ 350,000&#13;
would follow the Bank's ICB procedures using the Bank's standard bidding document for goods. There&#13;
would be approximately seven packages, with up to 95 contracts for textbooks and other didactic&#13;
materials following NCB procedures (aggregate total amount of US$11.0 million), using a Bank&#13;
approved standard bidding document.&#13;
3.9   International Shopping (IS) procedures (aggregate total amount of US$2.6 million) would be&#13;
used for the procurement of the technical equipment in pilot schools, rayon's training equipment&#13;
including computers, training materials and supplies, and for translated editions of Romanian&#13;
textbooks based on the comparison of price quotations from at least three different suppliers in at least&#13;
two different qualified countries. National shopping (NS) procedures (aggregate total amount of&#13;
US$0.8 million) would be used for contracts less than US$50,000 per contract based on price&#13;
quotations from at least three suppliers for computer, office and audio-visual equipment, office supplies&#13;
and other consumables. Procurement of proprietary items (specialized software for learning assessment&#13;
and subscriptions to technical joumals) would be based on direct contracting (aggregate total amount of&#13;
no more than US$20,000).&#13;
3.10   Training, Technical Assistance. and Studies (aggregate total amount of US$4.0 million).&#13;
Consultant services under the project would be required to assist with the implementation of all project&#13;
8 Russian translations of certain Romanian textbooks would be subject to bidding. If a winning bidder for a&#13;
particular textbook is not capable of producing a minority language translation, the Ministry of Education,&#13;
Youth, and Sports would buy the translation right and award the contract for the publication of the translated&#13;
book through International Shopping. At the maximum this would involve about 42 separate contracts at $&#13;
42,000 each (base costs). However, as it is expected that a large number of winning bidders for textbooks&#13;
will also be able to produce minority language versions, the number of contracts awarded through&#13;
International Shopping is likely to be significantly lower than the maximum here indicated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
components, including project management (see Annex VII for a description of technical assistance&#13;
required), and for studies in view of preparing a possible follow-up project. The majority of technical&#13;
assistance assignments for each component, other than the curriculum development component (which&#13;
will only require very specific, highly specialized, short term TA inputs) would be contracted through&#13;
component specific shortlisted TA contracts. Consultant services would be contracted in accordance&#13;
with Bank procurement procedures, including shortlisting for contracts with firms for the learning&#13;
assessment, teacher training, and textbook development components. There will be numerous local&#13;
training at different times of the year for trainers and teachers to be financed from the proceeds of the&#13;
loan. A detailed description of the type and duration of training courses is in Annex IV. Several&#13;
fellowships and study visits would also be financed under the loan proceeds. Participants and study&#13;
locations, including the institutions, would be selected on a competitive basis with criteria acceptable to&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
3.11   Miscellaneous Expenditures (aggregate total amount of US$0.2 million). The project would&#13;
introduce new processes of curriculum development and textbook financing in the country. In order to&#13;
solicit public support, a series of public participation consultations and public education campaigns to&#13;
gain feedback and explain the new systems and procedures would be carried out. Expenditures for&#13;
public consultations will include publication and distribution of draft curricula and holding of&#13;
consultation meetings. Since this will be an integral part of the curriculum development process and&#13;
involve small individual expenditures at various points in time, they will be based on direct purchasing.&#13;
The project would also finance incremental operating costs incurred by the PMU.&#13;
3.12   Prior Review. Procurement Monitoring and Reporting. Contracts for goods of US$200,000&#13;
equivalent or more and all consulting services would be subject to prior review. In addition, prior Bank&#13;
review would be required for the first five NCB procurement packages for textbooks and teaching&#13;
guides regardless of value. All procurement would be monitored closely and would be part of the&#13;
regular project progress report of the PMU. The procurement milestones are summarized in the&#13;
procurement plan in Annex XIII.&#13;

C. Disbursement&#13;
3.13   The proposed Bank loan of US$16.8 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period of&#13;
five years with an estimated completion date of June 30, 2002 and a closing date of December 31, 2002.&#13;
A detailed semester disbursement profile is in Annex IX. Disbursement of the loan proceeds would be&#13;
as follows:&#13;

Total                     16.8&#13;
3.14   Statements of expenditures (SOEs). The Bank may require disbursements to be made on the&#13;
basis of SOE for contracts for equipment, supplies, and training related expenditures not exceeding US$&#13;
200,000 or equivalent. Complete documentation supporting the SOEs would be retained by the PMU&#13;
and made available for review by the Bank and auditors. The minimum size of application for direct&#13;
payment from the Loan Account and issuance of a Special Commitrnent would be 20 percent of the&#13;
amount of authorized allocation to the Special Account.&#13;
3.15   Special Account (SA). A Special Account (SA) with an authorized allocation of US$300,000&#13;
based on four month average expenditures would be established in a commercial Bank on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank would make the deposit(s) into the Special Account up&#13;
to the amount of the authorized allocation. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
the Special Account would be limited to US$150,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements&#13;
under the loan have reached the level of US$3,000,000, the initial allocation may be increased up to the&#13;
authorized allocation of US$300,000 by submitting relevant applications for withdrawal. Applications&#13;
for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount&#13;
has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would&#13;
follow the standard Bank procedure. Monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have been&#13;
reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests. A Special Account has been&#13;
opened by the Borrower in an acceptable local bank to facilitate disbursement.&#13;
3.16   Project Preparation Facility (PPF). The Borrower requested a Project Preparation Facility&#13;
advance of US$700,000 to complete project preparation. The advance is being used to finance&#13;
consultant services to complete the design of the curriculum development process, teacher training&#13;
program, learning assessment, and textbook production. A limited amount is being used to finance&#13;
office and training equipment. The advance is also being used to test the efficiency and effectiveness of&#13;
the new textbook procurement scheme. The PPF advance would be refunded by December 31, 1997 or&#13;
if earlier, upon loan effectiveness.&#13;
D. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.17   The PMU would be responsible for maintaining project accounts, in a format acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Project accounts would show expenditures by project component, source of funds and by&#13;
expenditure category. The PMU would hold a separate account showing amounts expended under the&#13;
SOEs for each fiscal year and would maintain the Special Account. Project accounts would be audited&#13;
by a reputable auditing firm acceptable to the Bank in accordance with International Accounting and&#13;
Auditing Standards. The audits would include a separate opinion on the SOEs and SA to be submitted&#13;
to the Bank and the MOF. During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the Government that (i)&#13;
the Project Account shall be maintained and replenished it promptly with sufficient funds to finance the&#13;
Borrower's contribution to project expenditures; and (ii) within six months after the end of each fiscal&#13;
year, an annual audit report of the project accounts, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank&#13;
including an audit of the Special Account and a separate opinion on the SOEs and SA would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank.&#13;

4.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Management and Implementation&#13;
4.1    The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports will be responsible for overall direction,&#13;
coordination and oversight of project implementation. To this effect, the Ministry has designated three&#13;
distinct implementation agents: (i) a Project Steering Committee will provide overall guidance and&#13;
oversight, (ii) a project management unit (PMU) within the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports&#13;
will be in charge of overall project administration and logistical support to technical departments, and&#13;
(iii) technical departments and institutes under the Ministry will be in charge of implementing&#13;
individual project components.&#13;
4.2   Project Steering Committee. The steering committee, to be chaired by the First Deputy&#13;
Minister of Education, Youth, and Sports, would include the heads of key technical departments and&#13;
institutions in charge of implementing the various project components and representatives from the&#13;
Ministries of Finance, Economy and Education, Youth, and Sports. The Committee will be responsible&#13;
for providing overall guidance and project oversight and for monitoring performance progress. A&#13;
Government Decision No. 469-d dated November 11, 1996 was adopted that establishes the Project&#13;
Steering Committee with duly appointed members and with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
4.3    The Project Management Unit will be staffed by a project director, a deputy director in charge&#13;
of procurement, a part time accountant and an English speaking translator/administrative secretary.&#13;
The PMU will be responsible for day to day project management including preparation of work plans,&#13;
budgets and progress reports, all procurement, administration of and accounting for loan and&#13;
counterpart funds, and overall coordination of project implementation activities. The PMU will not&#13;
itself implement any project activities, but act as coordinator and administrator. The PMU will report&#13;
to the First Deputy Minister of Education, Youth, and Sports who has been designated by the Ministry&#13;
as the person responsible for overall preparation and implementation of the project.  Before&#13;
negotiations, the Borrower provided evidence to the Bank that a Project Director had been appointed&#13;
after Bank concurrence. During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the Government that the&#13;
Project Steering Committe (PSC), Project Management Unit (PML9, and Department for Evaluation&#13;
and Examinations (DEE) would be maintained, with membership and staffing, functions, and&#13;
responsibilities acceptable to the Bank throughout the project period The staff of the Project&#13;
Management Unit have been appointed to the satisfaction of the Bank.&#13;
4.4    Because this is the first Bank investment project in the sector, there is a marked lack of&#13;
management and planning skills in the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports, no one in Moldova&#13;
has prior experience with the Bank's complex textbook procurement procedures and because project&#13;
implementation must adhere to a tight implementation schedule to concur with the school year, the&#13;
PMU would be assisted by a foreign project advisor, familiar with implementation of World Bank&#13;
financed projects, during the first project year and possibly extended the following year if needed.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that the foreign project advisor&#13;
would be appointed and employed with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank. As a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness, the Borrower would provide evidence to the Bank that a Project Advisor, satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, has been appointed&#13;
4.5    Technical Departments and Ministerial Institutes. Implementation of actual project activities&#13;
will be the responsibility of relevant technical departments and institutions of the Ministry of&#13;
Education, Youth, and Sports.  Their responsibilities will include (i) overall organization and&#13;
monitoring of implementation of particular project components; (ii) preparation of detailed work plans,&#13;
budgets, physical requirements, and progress reports for submission to the PMU; (iii) finalization of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
technical specifications for equipment and materials to be purchased for implementation of their&#13;
component; and (iv) finalization of terms of reference for technical assistance and training required in&#13;
their respective parts of the project and, in cooperation with the PMU, evaluation of TA proposals&#13;
received. The following Ministerial Departments and Institutes will be in charge of implementing&#13;
individual components:&#13;
(i)    Curriculum Development. While the new institutional structure for curriculum and&#13;
assessment development will be in charge of actually developing and subsequently&#13;
monitoring the performance of the new curricula, the MEYS's Pre-University&#13;
Education Department, in coordination with the Institute of Pedagogical and&#13;
Psychological Studies will be responsible for overseeing overall implementation of this&#13;
component.&#13;
(ii)   Learning Assessment. The learning assessment component will be implemented by the&#13;
newly created Department of Evaluation and Examinations of the Ministry of&#13;
Education, Youth, and Sports.&#13;
(iii)   Teacher Training. Overall coordination and implementation of the in-service teacher&#13;
training component will be the responsibility of the National Institute for Teacher&#13;
Training, in coordination with the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports'&#13;
Department of Accreditation and Staff Training&#13;
(iv)   Textbook Development. Implementation of this component will be the responsibility&#13;
of the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports' Pre-University Education Department&#13;
in collaboration with the Department for Didactic Materials and Library Assistance,&#13;
although procurement of textbooks will be handled by the PMU. The textbook fund&#13;
will be managed by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports' Finance and&#13;
Accounting department- under the direct supervision of the Inter-ministerial&#13;
Supervisory Committee.&#13;
4.6    Each technical department and/or Ministerial Institute in charge of a particular component will&#13;
be responsible for ensuring that project activities are carried out in accordance with the agreed upon&#13;
project objectives.  The Project Implementation Manual and other detailed project preparation&#13;
documents for each component, together with the project implementation schedule (Annex X) will&#13;
serve as guidelines for the implementation of each component.&#13;
B. Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.7   Implementation Schedule. The proposed project would be implemented over a five-year period&#13;
with an additional six months for payment of financial obligations committed after the project&#13;
completion date of June 30, 2002 and full withdrawal of Loan proceeds. The PMU would submit an&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) to the Bank within six months of the closing date. A&#13;
summary of the project implementation schedule by component is in Annex X.&#13;
4.8    Monitoring and Reporting. To monitor project progress and evaluate project outcome, a set of&#13;
project performance indicators has been developed (Annex XI). The indicators provide a framework&#13;
for systematic monitoring of project implementation progress and will serve as basis for the format of a&#13;
routine progress report to be completed by the PMU. Based on inputs from individual implementation&#13;
agencies, the PMU would be responsible for preparing quarterly progress reports for submission to the&#13;
steering committee. Using agreed upon monitoring indicators as a basis, the PMU would also submit&#13;
semi-annual progress reports to the Bank covering each component's standing with respect to status and&#13;
issues; deviations from project targets and implementation plan; plans for the following six months;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
recommendations; and actual and planned expenditures. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtainedfrom the Government that the PMU, representing the MEYS, would prepare andfurnish to the&#13;
Bank semi-annual progress reports on all project activities in accordance with performance indicators&#13;
as agreed with the Bank.&#13;
4.9    Project Evaluation. Evaluation of project progress and adoption of necessary corrective actions&#13;
are important to the project, particularly in view of the fact that this is the Bank's first education project&#13;
in Moldova. Therefore, in addition to the regular project progress evaluation activities, a mid-term&#13;
evaluation would be carried out jointly by the Borrower and the Bank, after two years of project&#13;
implementation. During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the Government that a mid-term&#13;
evaluation report will be submitted to the Bank, no later than one and three quarter years after loan&#13;
effectiveness and will serve as basis for the joint Bank - Borrower mid-term review. This report would&#13;
indicate the project progress from inception and propose additional measures and changes as&#13;
necessary to ensure achievement ofproject objectives.&#13;
C. Supervision&#13;
4.10   Project Supervision.  Periodic supervision of project implementation would be a joint&#13;
responsibility of the MEYS and the Bank. The Project Steering Committee and the First Deputy&#13;
Minister of Education, Youth, and Sports would be responsible for supervision on the Borrower's side.&#13;
The Bank would carry out regular, semi-annual supervision missions. Because this is the first social&#13;
sector project in Moldova, Bank supervision requirements are expected to be higher than the Bank's&#13;
average. A supervision plan is presented in Annex XII.&#13;
&#13;

5.   BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits and Justification&#13;
5.1    The project is expected to result in a series of reformed institutional structures and processes&#13;
which will contribute to ongoing improvements and changes in the education system beyond project&#13;
completion. In particular, the project will establish a framework for curriculum development which&#13;
allows for greater transparency, stakeholder participation and feedback, increased curricula coherence&#13;
and integration of assessment and curriculum development. The project will also set the stage for more&#13;
reliable and valid national examinations and monitoring of sectoral performance, thus increasing public&#13;
accountability in education. It will introduce a system of open competition for textbook authorship and&#13;
publication which is expected to result in higher quality textbooks. The project will provide for&#13;
sufficient textbooks in classrooms to allow for more effective instruction and learning to more than&#13;
600,000 pupils. It will support the establishment of a cost recovery system for textbooks which will&#13;
help ensure that funds are available to reprint or republish books introduced under the project upon&#13;
project completion. It will introduce a system of in-service teacher training benefiting approximately&#13;
45,000 educators which is significantly more cost-effective than the current system and which is&#13;
expected to lead to closer collaboration between staff of the rayon education directorates and teachers,&#13;
thus facilitating the introduction of new teaching and learning methods in general and the new subject&#13;
curricula in particular.&#13;
5.2    While the immediate project beneficiaries will be general education students, the project is&#13;
expected to benefit the entire education system over time, as new institutional setups and procedures&#13;
will be expanded to cover other areas of education. By improving the quality of education, the project&#13;
will contribute to an improved human capital base and hence benefit the labor market and the economy&#13;
as a whole.&#13;
B. Sustainability and Risks&#13;
5.3    There are three major risks in this project. First, the country's tight fiscal situation may prevent&#13;
the Government from making the necessary counterpart funds available on a timely basis, thus&#13;
preventing important project activities from being carried out effectively. Similarly, shortage of funds&#13;
may prevent key project activities to be carried out beyond project completion. The former risk is&#13;
being minimized by limiting Government counterpart contributions to a critical minimum.&#13;
5.4    Care was taken during project design to minimize incremental recurrent costs of a permanent&#13;
nature, so as to not endanger sustainability of project achievements beyond project completion. Cost&#13;
effectiveness considerations were a critical aspect of project design and the least cost option has been&#13;
chosen where ever this option was not expected to result in significant quality loss. The cost recovery&#13;
system for textbooks will help to introduce a system which should allow for supply of new textbooks on&#13;
a regular basis upon project completion. Given that textbooks account for almost 70% of project costs,&#13;
this will be a key aspect of guaranteeing sustainability beyond project completion.&#13;
5.5    The second risk is that changes in the political and administrative leadership in the education&#13;
sector may hamper future actions necessary to implement the systemic reforms underlying the project.&#13;
This risk has been minimized by significantly involving working level persons of the Ministry of&#13;
Education, Youth, and Sports, educational institutions and other key Ministries in project design&#13;
through participatory workshops and through close collaboration between key staff and the project&#13;
preparation team. During appraisal, the preparation team agreed with the implementing agencies on a&#13;
detailed project implementation plan with monitorable indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
5.6    The risk of resistance to change at the local level will be minimized through a series of&#13;
informational workshops throughout the country prior to project implementation and subsequent&#13;
stakeholder participation and consultation processes, particularly in the area of curriculum&#13;
development.&#13;
5.7    The third and possibly most important risk is that the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports'&#13;
inexperience with project management in general, and Bank-assisted projects in particular, will hamper&#13;
smooth project implementation. A limited number of project components and close involvement of key&#13;
Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports staff at all stages of project development should help reduce&#13;
this risk. However, despite limiting project activities to four closely inter-related components and to&#13;
mandatory general education, project implementation is based on an ambitious implementation&#13;
schedule which can only be adhered to if the project is well managed and monitored. Procurement of&#13;
textbooks and equipment will put particularly high demands on the PMU during the initial two project&#13;
years. Given the lack of management and planning skills in the Ministry of Education, Youth, and&#13;
Sports and the unfamiliarity with complex Bank procurement procedures, it will therefore be essential&#13;
that the PMU be assisted by an internationally experienced project advisor during the first project year&#13;
and possibly to be extended for another year if needed.&#13;

MOLDOVA GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Curriculum Development Component&#13;
Bacground&#13;
I.    The new social and economic realities have made it necessary to substantially revise the&#13;
entire curricula in Moldova's education system, so as to assure that the knowledge and skills&#13;
transmitted by the education system properly respond to the new social and economic realities.&#13;
The bulk of curricula currently in use in Moldova's schools are a legacy of the past, reflecting&#13;
the ideology and approach to learning of the former political system. Curricula are mainly&#13;
content- and knowledge-based, expecting students to learn and recite facts rather than develop&#13;
cognitive skills. Rote learning and memorization thus dominate higher order skills like critical&#13;
thinking and problem solving. The teaching process is mainly authoritarian and frontal. To&#13;
prepare the future labor force effectively to enter an increasingly flexible but demanding labor&#13;
market, it will be critical that the education system teach students more cognitive and social&#13;
skills such as creative thinking, problem solving, decision making and responding to&#13;
unanticipated problems and move away from transmitting mere facts. Recognizing the needs to&#13;
substantially upgrade the national curricula both in terms, of subject contents and in terms of&#13;
approaches to learning, the Government has initiated a program of curriculum reform, starting&#13;
with general education.&#13;
2.    Regulatory Documents. At present, three categories of curricula related regulatory&#13;
documents are used and being prepared in Moldova: the National Plan of Study which&#13;
comprises a list of subjects for each stage of the system (Primary, 'Incomplete Secondary'&#13;
[Grades 5-9], 'Complete Secondary' [Grades 0- 11] and Lyceum [Grades 10-12]), the type of&#13;
school (e.g. schools with emphasis on foreign languages, arts) and the number of lessons per&#13;
week for every subject and grade; (ii) the general psycho-pedagogical "Conceptions" which&#13;
assure the theoretical and methodological background for different components of the system&#13;
and, (iii) Syllabuses for every subject, according to the grade and type of school. Each Syllabus&#13;
is, in fact, more like a written curriculum. It omprises a list of general and specific objectives,&#13;
content items and areas and sometimes even methodological recommendations.&#13;
3.    Development of Curricula Documents.  The development of these three types of&#13;
documents is coordinated by a special departrnent of the Ministry of Education, Youth, and&#13;
Sports (MEYS) - the Department of General Education, which is organised into three units&#13;
(covering Primary education, Mathematics and Sciences, and Humanities) with specialists acting&#13;
as subject officers. Up to now, the preliminary versions of the Conceptions and Syllabuses have&#13;
been developed by experts from the Institute of Psychological and Pedagogical Studies (IPPS).&#13;
In this Institute, researchers/curriculum developers are working in different laboratories - a&#13;
Primary laboratory and then different subject-based laboratories for the Secondary stage. After&#13;
development, the drafts of the Conceptions and Syllabuses are discussed within the Scientific&#13;
Board of the IPPS, and sometimes also with other specialists. Following this preliminary stage,&#13;
the Conceptions and Syllabuses are sent to the Expert Commission (EC), which functions&#13;
alongside the MEYS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.     There are ECs for each subject taught in the education system as well as - separately -&#13;
for pre-school and Primary education. The ECs are made up - generally - of University&#13;
professors, researchers in education, representatives of different central institutions (e.g.&#13;
Academy of Sciences), inspectors and teachers. An EC usually has 15-25 members. The&#13;
President of the EC, in most cases, is a University professor. The ECs are consultative bodies.&#13;
Their main roles are to assess the pedagogical and scientific quality of the subject materials and&#13;
to approve them for consideration by the Council of the MEYS. The ECs discuss and establish&#13;
the subject Conception and the Syllabus. They also review periodically the general and specific&#13;
objectives and the content, often comparing them to those of other countries. At the same time,&#13;
they recommend methods and equipment, and approve textbooks and teaching/learning support&#13;
materials. Once approved, the Conceptions and the Syllabuses are sent to the Council of&#13;
Minister for consideration in order to be declared official curriculum documents.&#13;
Ke Issues&#13;
6.     The current approach to curriculum development has two main shortcomings. First, the&#13;
institutional structure and processes are such that coordination and cooperation across disciplines&#13;
and grade levels is virtually absent, resulting in a set of curricula documents which severely lack&#13;
coherence. Second, curriculum development, review and adoption is a relatively closed process,&#13;
with very limited, if any input, from key stakeholders such as teachers or the community at large.&#13;
Consultation is essentially limited to ECs seeking one or two outside experts' views of a&#13;
particular document. As a result, teachers are little aware of planned curricular changes and it is&#13;
questionable how much support the actual introduction of new curricula will eventually find.&#13;
Finally, most of the new curricular documents largely ignore learning assessment issues.&#13;
7.     The development of new conceptions and syllabuses currently occurs neither in&#13;
accordance with a long-term action plan nor, with a short term timetable. Furthermore, there are&#13;
no clear guidelines which would set out the expected format and overall contents of either&#13;
document.  Institutional arrangements and processes are such that curriculum  developers&#13;
working on a particular conception or subject curriculum work largely in isolation. At the same&#13;
time the ECs meet only on an ad hoc basis without an internal timetable or action plan.&#13;
Cooperation and transdisciplinary coordination among ECs is virtually absent. Consequently the&#13;
current status of different documents within the framework of the national curriculum&#13;
development process varies from subject to subject. Curricula for a particular grade are not&#13;
developed and adopted at the same time and both conceptions and subject syllabuses vary greatly&#13;
in terms of format, contents and quality. Overall, the newly developed curricular documents&#13;
suffer from a sever lack of vertical and horizontal coherence.&#13;
8.     To assure increased coherence, quality and stakeholder ownership of new curricula, it is&#13;
essential that both the institutional arrangements and the processes for curriculum development&#13;
be substantially revised.  In this respect, the Government is planning on changing the&#13;
institutional structure for curriculum development as well as the overall approach. The proposed&#13;
project's curriculum development component will support this initiative.&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
9.     The curriculum development component aims at establishing an institutional framework&#13;
and new curriculum development processes which will allow for the development of high&#13;
quality, coherent curricula that have been developed and reviewed with the participation of key&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
ANNEX l&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
stakeholders. While the project will only support the development of new curricula for&#13;
mandatory general education, it is expected that, if successful, the new institutional structures&#13;
and approach to curriculum development would continue to be applied towards the development&#13;
of new curricula at other education levels.&#13;
Component Description&#13;
10.   The curriculum development component of the proposed project comprises three sub-&#13;
components: (i) the establishment of an integrated, coherent institutional structure for&#13;
Curriculum Development and Learning Assessment/Evaluation; (ii) the development and&#13;
establishment of new curricula for mandatory general education; and (iii) support to teachers&#13;
with the implementation of the new curriculum.&#13;
Institutional Structure&#13;
I1.   The objective of the sub-component is the establishment of a coherent and integrated&#13;
institutional framework for curriculum development and learning assessment which will allow&#13;
for increased coherence, quality and openness of the curriculum development process. It would&#13;
also assure coherence between curricula and performance objectives, by integrating learning&#13;
assessment objectives into the curriculum development process. The new institutional structure,&#13;
which the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports aims at setting up by the end of 1996, would&#13;
consist of three tiers: (i) a National Curriculum and Assessment Council (NCAC) in charge of&#13;
overall education policy and process managing functions with respect to the national curriculum&#13;
and learning assessment; (ii) a Coordinating Commission for Curriculum and Assessment&#13;
Evaluation (CCAEC) in charge of evaluating curriculum development and learning assessment&#13;
instruments in terms of their quality and coherence and, (iii) subject area specific Working&#13;
Groups (WG) in charge of developing draft subject curricula, including learning objectives and&#13;
supporting materials.&#13;

12.   The National Curriculum and Assessment Council will be a permanent autonomous body&#13;
reporting directly to the Minister of Education, Youth, and Sports. It will initially be staffed by&#13;
representatives of all key institutions concerned with curriculum reform and its implementation&#13;
and will be established by order of the Minister for a period of five years. In the medium term it&#13;
is expected that the composition of the NCAC will change to also include representatives from&#13;
the community at large. The rationale behind this structure is that it will be a Board of highly&#13;
qualified educators in curriculum development and learning assessment who will have the&#13;
responsibility to establish the short- and long term-policy in curriculum development in Moldova&#13;
consistent with the aims of the education reform and the further needs of the country.&#13;
13.   Key responsibilities of the NCAC will include the following:&#13;
*  to ensure the production of a set of working guidelines for the development of the&#13;
National Curriculum's components;&#13;
*  to propose for approval a national policy on curriculum and assessment for the&#13;
educational system and ensure ongoing adaptation of the curriculum and assessment&#13;
schemes to the changing needs of the nation;&#13;
-  to organise, supervise and manage the long-term National Curriculum development&#13;
process;&#13;
-  to ensure that the Subject Curricula satisfy the general requirements of the education&#13;
policy as a whole and the aims of the education system;&#13;
-  to review and propose (for approval) assessment policy as needed;&#13;
*  to ensure the quality of CCECA's plan pertaining to the public consultation&#13;
conceming the (draft) Conceptions and the (draft) Subject Curricula;&#13;
-  to ensure the coherence of the curricula with other components of the system:&#13;
assessment &amp; evaluation, teacher training, management and financing, etc.; and,&#13;
-  to approve and present the components of the National Curriculum to the Minister of&#13;
Education, Youth, and Sports for final decision and implementation.&#13;
14.   The NCAC will be assisted by a small Technical and Managerial Service which will&#13;
provide the entire curriculum development institutional structure with managerial, logistical and&#13;
secretarial support.&#13;
15.   The middle tier consists for the Coordinating Commission for Evaluation of Curriculum&#13;
and Assessment (CCECA) (see figure 3) which will replace the current expert commissions. The&#13;
CCECA is a non-permanent operational body that performs curriculum and assessment&#13;
monitoring and evaluation activity according to the framework set out by the NCAC. The&#13;
CCECA has a president who is also a member of the NCAC. It has five sub-commissions, four&#13;
subject commissions pertaining to respective curriculum areas and one sub-commission in&#13;
charge of assessment, examinations and evaluation. The CCECA's main responsibilities are to&#13;
ensure quality and cohesion between and within proposed subject curricula and accompanying&#13;
assessment schemes, to coordinate the nation wide consultation process and review draft curricula&#13;
in light of the consultation outcomes.&#13;

16.    The final tier consist of the working groups for curriculum  development and&#13;
assessment. The Working Groups are non-permanent technical bodies with the task of developing&#13;
the new subject curricula and related assessment objectives and performance criteria, curricula&#13;
related equipment lists, assessment schemes and supporting materials for teachers. These WGs are&#13;
created for all subjects and are linked to the framework of CCECA's 5 Coordination Commissions.&#13;
There are 15 non-permanent Working Groups (Wgs), 14 Subject Specific Working Groups, and a&#13;
Working Group for 'Assessment &amp; Evaluation' (AEWG). The coordinator of each working group&#13;
will be a staff of the IPPS and will continue to follow and evaluate the curriculum once it is under&#13;
implementation. The rest of the working groups will be dissolved once all relevant curricula have&#13;
been developed and accepted. They will be reconvened by the NCAC once the latter considers that&#13;
there is a need to substantially upgrade the curriculum. The novelty of this structure is that&#13;
curricula will no longer be developed by a single IPPS staff in isolation, but by a group of qualified&#13;
people, including teachers and school inspectors. Furthermore, the existence of a particular&#13;
working group on assessment and evaluation will assure that curriculum objectives, assessment&#13;
objectives and performance criteria are coherent and integrated.&#13;

Curriculum Development Process&#13;
17.   The second sub-component consists of the actual development of the national curriculum&#13;
for mandatory general education. The national curriculum will have two components: A&#13;
regulatory document which will constitute the conceptual and strategic basis for the national&#13;
curriculum and will ensure a coherent framework for the development of subject curricula. It&#13;
will act as a system of reference for the pedagogic approach and the implementation process of&#13;
the new curriculum. The second element will by the individual grade specific subject curricula.&#13;
18.   All subject curricula for any one grade will be prepared by the relevant working groups&#13;
at the same time to a given deadline. Curricula will be developed by the working groups, then&#13;
pass through a first review by the Coordination Commissions for Evaluation of Curriculum and&#13;
Assessment. Subsequently, the working group, together with the CCECA organizes a nation&#13;
wide consultation process consisting of four elements: (i) two regional workshops with rayon&#13;
education directorate subject specialists and school representatives, the first one to review the&#13;
draft curricula, get initial feedback and instruct them on how to collect feedback from teachers,&#13;
the second one to collate the responses from the rayon coordinators after their consultation with&#13;
schools and teachers; (ii) feedback from teachers country wide through systematized collection&#13;
of responses from teachers who have been given a chance to review the draft; (iii) soliciting of&#13;
2 expert reviews from within the country and, (iv) for key subject areas at the initial stage&#13;
soliciting of one foreign expert review. The consultation part is a key innovation in the&#13;
curriculum development process in Moldova and is expected to help increase stakeholder&#13;
participation, ownership and support of curricula by those in charge of eventually implementing&#13;
it and to raise the overall quality of the document.&#13;
19.   Working group coordinators, in cooperation with the CCECA will prepare a consultation&#13;
report based on the results collected during the consultation process. The latter will be used as a&#13;
basis to revise the draft curriculum and will also be submitted to the NCAC. The revised&#13;
curriculum will be reviewed by the CCECA, which will pay particular attention to inter- and&#13;
intra-disciplinary coherence and the overall quality of the curriculum and either recommend the&#13;
curriculum to the NCAC for adoption or request further revisions from the working groups prior&#13;
to forwarding the curriculum to the NCAC. It is expected that by the end of the project a total of&#13;
134 subject grade curricula will have been developed.&#13;
20.   Curriculum Monitoring. Once a curriculum is under implementation, the working group&#13;
coordinators (who are the only permanent feature in the working group structure and are IPPS&#13;
staff) will monitor the feedback form the implementation process. Initially, feedback will be&#13;
sought from teachers at the teacher training refresher courses, subsequently feedback will be&#13;
collected in a systematic fashion through the existing infrastructure.  Working group&#13;
coordinators will prepare an annual implementation report for transmission to the NCAC. The&#13;
latter will decide whether the coordinator should develop minor changes to be transmitted to&#13;
schools or whether it will be necessary to reconvene the working groups for a major curriculum&#13;
overhaul.&#13;
Support with Curriculum Implementation&#13;
21.   This sub-component will promote the implementation of the new curricula through four&#13;
main activities. First, development and distribution to teachers and rayon education directorates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

of support materials (information brochures) developed by the work groups. These materials&#13;
will describe, clarify and illustrate the critical and main curricular changes, both in terms of&#13;
content and in terms of methodology. Second, working group members, particularly those of the&#13;
assessment working group, will contribute to the training of trainers and training of teachers&#13;
under the teacher training component. Third, working group members and CCECA members&#13;
will be called upon to participate in the manuscript evaluation committees for new textbooks.&#13;
Fourth, a limited number of pilot schools will be equipped with appropriate materials for science&#13;
and technology teaching to support the implementation of the new curriculum in this area. The&#13;
detailed list of equipment would be drawn up by the curriculum development working groups&#13;
and be subject to approval by the World Bank. Similarly, the criteria for selecting pilot schools&#13;
would be subject to approval by the World Bank, once the equipment list has been established.&#13;
The rationale for equipping a number of pilot schools would be to test and establish a list of&#13;
minimum equipment necessary to effectively teach those requiring such equipment before&#13;
embarking on large scale investments across the country.&#13;

MOLDOVA GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Learning Assessment Component&#13;
The Current Assessment and Examination System&#13;
1.    Assessment in Primary School. In primary education the assessment of pupil learning is entirely&#13;
school and classroom based. Teachers assess their pupils using a variety of methods, including oral&#13;
questioning, short quizzes or end-of-chapter tests, work done in class or as homework. The first semi-&#13;
external exam comes at the end of grade 4, where children sit on a one-hour "control" tests in mother&#13;
tongue language and in mathematics. These tests are prepared by subject specialists in the MEYS. Each&#13;
consists of 3 basic questions covering the minimum (basic competence) level required by the national&#13;
curriculum and additional questions (up to 7) of increasing difficulty. Subject specialists prepare&#13;
between 5 and 10 "variants" of these tests of which the First Deputy Minister of Education, Youth, and&#13;
Sports in consultation with subject matter specialists, chooses 2 final variants to be administered in&#13;
schools. Only relevant teachers in schools are given a copy of the exam paper. They then write the&#13;
exam questions on the black board for pupils to answer. Teachers mark the tests according to the&#13;
instructions given, and results are collected and announced to the pupils immediately. Teachers,&#13;
however, are not trained in marking the exams, and there is no system set up to co-ordinate it. Marks are&#13;
simply discussed within the school and sent back to the subject specialists at the MEYS together with a&#13;
summary and comments. The MEYS collates and analyses the results of the grade 4 examination and&#13;
prepares a summary report.&#13;
2.    Formal examinations.  Under the existing system  of "complete" (11 years) education,&#13;
examinations occur at two points: at the end of compulsory education (end of grade 9) and at the end of&#13;
grade 11 to mark the completion of secondary education. Since 1994, there has been a Baccalaureate&#13;
examination at the end of grade 12 in the new "Iycees". In addition to the formal graduation&#13;
examinations after grades 9, 11/12, students take "promotion examinations" in two subjects at the end of&#13;
each secondary school grade where no graduation examination is given.&#13;
3.    Examination subjects for both, promotion and graduation examinations, are established yearly by&#13;
Ministerial order. Ministry subject matter specialists prepare the question papers for written exams and&#13;
the "tickets" for oral exams, except for exams in topics chosen by the students for grades 10 and 11. The&#13;
latter are set by each school in accordance with the syllabi in use. The written examinations for grades 9&#13;
and 11 prepared by the Ministry are broadcast over the radio on examination day at a specified time.&#13;
Written tests are marked by teachers in their own schools in accordance with guidelines sent by the&#13;
Ministry. Oral tests are marked by the pupil's own teacher, but at least one other teacher must be present&#13;
during the examination. Teachers are not specifically trained in marking and no co-ordination of&#13;
marking occurs (i.e., teachers do not try to equate their marking with each other either within subjects&#13;
and schools or across subjects and schools).&#13;
4.    The primary function of the external secondary school exams is certification and not selection.&#13;
Approximately 68,000 pupils take the examination at the end of compulsory education (grade 9). About&#13;
90% of them pass. In principle, the transition from grade 9 to full secondary education is open to every&#13;
student, but many schools in full secondary education have their own entrance procedure - like an&#13;
entrance exam, a competition, or an admission interview. A certificate of full secondary education&#13;
(grade I 1) gives the student the right to apply for higher education, but this does not guarantee automatic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
ANEX m&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
access. One of the problems with the present examinations, both at grades 9 and 11, is the low social&#13;
value attached to them. This is due to the uncertain and uneven quality and level of the examination. In&#13;
addition, the high passing level obscures specific information about the achievement of individual pupil.&#13;
The socially important "high stakes" examinations are the entrance (receiving) examinations both for&#13;
grade 10 (especially for lycee entrance) and for higher education.  These examinations are not&#13;
standardized as institution sets its own, creating problems of quality control, access and equity, as well as&#13;
presenting a double hurdle for pupils.&#13;
Key Issues&#13;
5.     The current system of examination and assessment, particularly at the secondary level suffers&#13;
from several shortcomings which need to be addressed. If Moldova needs to develop a valid and fair&#13;
assessment and examination system which is capable of measuring adequately student achievement and&#13;
also of providing the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports and the public with an overall view of&#13;
how well the education system performs.&#13;
6.     The key shortcomings of the current system are:&#13;
(i) Students are over-tested but under-assessed in terms of formative information and&#13;
acquisition of flexible skills. The large number of examinations administered each year in&#13;
secondary education suggests that students are over-tested. The Ministry recognizes the&#13;
problem and plans to replace the current system of graduation and promotion exams with a&#13;
simpler system in which students will be externally examined only at the end of each&#13;
education cycle, that is, at the end of grade 4, grade 9 and grade 11/12. At the same time,&#13;
focus of the examinations should be on testing critical thinking skills, rather than mere recall&#13;
of factual information.&#13;
(ii) Examinations and classroom tests are heavy on content and knowledge relying almost&#13;
exclusively on recall of facts. Very little attention is paid to the domains or types of skill&#13;
tested and whether these relate to specified curriculum objectives. Exams largely fail to test&#13;
how well students apply acquired knowledge to various unexpected situations, and how well&#13;
they have developed their critical thinking skills.&#13;
(iii)Centrally set written examinations are of low technical quality. They lack validity,&#13;
reliability, and comparability in terms of level of difficulty and across time. The range types&#13;
of questions used is limited; few are used other than the open-ended questions and some&#13;
binary or multiple choice. The validity of tests and exams is generally low, both in terms of&#13;
skills they test and in terms of face validity. The reliability of the present examination and&#13;
assessment system in Moldova is a serious problem. Because of the way in which tests are&#13;
administered, their results are not reliable and not internally consistent. This means that the&#13;
results which the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports received at the end of each&#13;
testing period do not give reliable picture of what Moldovan students across the country&#13;
know, understand and can do; nor of the year's cohort's performance comparable to that of&#13;
previous years.&#13;
(iv) Absence of clear linkages with curriculum objectives. The objectives for assessment and&#13;
performance standards are not only unclear but also not linked to the curriculum objectives.&#13;
As the new curriculum is developed, it will be critical that assessment of objectives be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
ANNEXIm&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
developed in tandem with the new curriculum; these objectives should be formulated in&#13;
terms of the range and types of skills to be tested, rather than on the facts to be recalled.&#13;
(v) Lack of an identifiable cadre of trained specialists with adequate time and resources to&#13;
develop technically acceptable instruments of assessment. At present, the task of setting&#13;
question papers and "tickets" rests with members of the General Directorate of Pre-&#13;
university Education. They have many other tasks and demands on their time, they lack&#13;
specialist expertise, examples of good practice and even the basic resources required to&#13;
properly plan, test, administer and evaluate examinations. If Moldova is committed to&#13;
designing and introducing an evaluation system capable of monitoring not only what pupils&#13;
learn, but also how schools and teachers work, how the intended curriculum is implemented,&#13;
and how resources are used, it must establish an institutional framework and assign&#13;
professional and technically competent people to accomplish this. Training of competent&#13;
specialists and dissemination of examples of good testing practice among administrators and&#13;
teachers will be essential.&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
7.    The main goal of this component is to ensure that, by the end of the Project, every student taking&#13;
a graduation examination in Moldovan schools will be given his/her own copy of an examination paper&#13;
which is carefully designed and constructed, linked with national standards and curriculum objectives,&#13;
composed of questions which ask for more than recall of factual knowledge and are interesting and&#13;
challenging to pupils of varying levels of ability. In support of this goal, the component also aims at&#13;
creating a stable, identifiable assessment function within the MEYS and establishing mechanisms to&#13;
support teachers in their own classrooms and improving their assessment techniques.&#13;
Component Design&#13;
8.    To achieve the above stated objectives in Moldova's present circumstances, full-scale "reform"&#13;
of the assessment system is neither possible nor necessary. The approach adopted under the proposed&#13;
project consists of a mixture of classroom-based diagnostic and formative tests; formal examinations&#13;
(through the existing, but improved, external system); and sample-based periodic assessments using an&#13;
appropriate sampling frame and baseline data gathered from selected schools. It is not appropriate to the&#13;
Moldovan context to introduce external "standardized" tests composed largely or entirely of objective-&#13;
type questions (multiple choice, etc.), even though their efficiency, speed of marking, relatively low&#13;
price, and accurate calibration are attractive where resources are limited. Performance-based and oral&#13;
testing are well established here; teachers and pupils are attuned to them, and their validity, while not&#13;
high, can be improved.&#13;
9.     The component will support the development of an improved assessment and examinations&#13;
system in four key areas: (i) close co-ordination with and integration of assessment aspects into the new&#13;
curriculum; (ii) improvement of key national examinations at grades 4 and 9 which would allow to&#13;
monitor student performance and the impact of the new curriculum and textbooks on learning outcomes;&#13;
(iii) training of rayons' inspectors, methodologists and teachers in new approaches to assessment; and&#13;
(iv) carrying out of a sample-based survey of student achievements under the current system against&#13;
which student performance could subsequently be measured in the nation wide examinations.&#13;
10.   Integrated Structure for Curriculum Development and Assessment. Close co-ordination between&#13;
the development of curricula and assessment functions will be ensured through the integration of an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -                                 ANNExN&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
assessment working group, a co-ordinating commission for assessment and evaluation and a specialist in&#13;
assessment in the national curriculum  council (see Annex 2).  This integration will ensure that&#13;
assessment objectives will be developed in tandem and in close co-ordination with curriculum objectives,&#13;
that appropriate ways and means of assessing proposed subject curricula at various levels are formulated,&#13;
and that there is coherence of assessment packages and formats across subjects and education levels.&#13;
Members of the assessment working group and the assessment co-ordinating commission will receive&#13;
specialized in-country training to carry out their work upon the establishment of the new structure.&#13;
11.   Improvement of graduation examinations: The project would help improve national graduation&#13;
examinations at the end of grades 4 and 9g through the establishment, training and equipment of a&#13;
specialized technical unit for examinations and assessment in the Ministry of Education, Youth, and&#13;
Sports and by making sure that each student will be given his/her own high quality examination paper.&#13;
The Department of Examinations and Evaluation (DEE) would be staffed through a redeployment of&#13;
ministerial staff who would receive specialized intensive training in assessment and examinations,&#13;
domestically and abroad. Key responsibilities of the DEE would be:&#13;
*  to design, pre-test, and produce high-quality written and oral tests for grades 4 and 9 national&#13;
examinations, on the basis of standards and objectives set by the integrated curriculum and&#13;
assessment institutional structure;&#13;
*  to plan and co-ordinate the administration and organization of these centrally set examinations,&#13;
collect and analyze the results, and prepare reports to the MEYS and NCAC;&#13;
*  to provide teachers in schools with sample diagnostic, formative tests and support (assessment)&#13;
materials, in order to assess the progress of their students;&#13;
X  to design and produce the General Guide for Assessment and Examinations, and specific guides for&#13;
different subjects;&#13;
*  to design and build item banks;&#13;
*  to design and build a database which will give an accurate overall view of progress in pupils'&#13;
learning and to carry out periodic sample-based assessments aimed at monitoring performance&#13;
trends over time; and&#13;
*  to provide expert help and training to rayons' inspectors, methodologists and teachers.&#13;
12.    The unit would be properly equipped to carry out its new functions, including desktop publishing&#13;
and high volume multiplication facilities for production of examinations with appropriate face validity&#13;
and equipment for item banking and statistical analysis of results.&#13;
13.    Training of teachers and rayon education directorate staff: A training module on learning&#13;
assessment, evaluation and examinations to familiarize rayon education directorate staff and teachers&#13;
with new approaches to national assessment, new curriculum linked assessment objectives, and with&#13;
improved methods for classroom assessment will be contained in the in-service teacher training&#13;
component. Supporting materials for this training will be developed by the DEE as well as by the&#13;
curriculum-linked working groups for assessment. Both units, supported by specialized technical&#13;
assistance, will also provide support to the development and actual carrying out of such training courses.&#13;
Supporting materials, such as guides on assessment and evaluation and sample tests will be produced and&#13;
made available to teachers and rayon directorates.&#13;
While the project only covers mandatory general education and will thus only focus on improving grades 4 and 9&#13;
examinations, project activities will certainly also have a positive impact on grade 11/12 school leaving&#13;
examinations, as the technical unit to be set up, trained and equipped in the Ministry of Education, Youth,&#13;
and Sports will also be in charge of these exams.&#13;
&#13;

14.   Baseline SurvyD: The project will support the carrying out of a sample-based baseline survey of&#13;
student performance in key subjects under the old curriculum for grade 6 against which future student&#13;
achievements following introduction of the new curriculum and teaching materials can be measured.&#13;
15.   Program SuppQor: Due to the virtual absence of any qualified cadre in the area of assessment and&#13;
evaluation, training and technical assistance to help build up local capacity will be an essential part of&#13;
project support. Training will be provided through three forms: (i) local seminars held by international&#13;
and regional subject matter specialists; (ii) fellowships for key DEE staff to attend intensive 3-4 months&#13;
training courses in assessment and evaluation at specialized institutions abroad; and, (iii) on-the-job&#13;
training through international technical assistance for the development of training and support materials&#13;
for teachers and rayon staff; development and execution of teacher training courses on assessment;&#13;
design and execution of baseline surveys; design, pre-testing, administration of national grades 4 and 9&#13;
examinations; and analysis and dissemination of examination results.  In addition, a group of&#13;
representatives from the NCAC, the CCEAC, the assessment working groups, and the DEE will&#13;
undertake a study tour to Western Europe which will focus on learning assessment.&#13;
16.   Members of the working groups and co-ordination commissions for assessment from the&#13;
integrated curriculum development and assessment structure will go through two rounds of local training&#13;
courses. The first course, to be taught by regional and international experts at the beginning of their&#13;
work, will focus on definition of assessment objectives linked to curriculum objectives and development&#13;
of corresponding assessment mechanisms. The second course, to be taught after drafts of the primary&#13;
school curricula including assessment related materials will have been completed, will focus on a joint&#13;
review of the draft materials and on how to improve them.&#13;
17.   At least two members of the DEE will be sent to intensive 3 to 4 months training on assessment&#13;
and evaluation abroad. The remainder will receive local training through a needs-tailored course to be&#13;
taught by international experts and follow-up support through TA provided on-the-job training.&#13;

MOLDOVA GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Teacher Retraining Component&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Improving teacher performance through retraining is a key element of any education&#13;
system and is considered an especially high priority for this country's education reform effort.&#13;
Teacher training in Moldova continues to be affected by the approach to learning inherited from&#13;
the past system. Teacher training curricula remain extremely subject centered and little attention&#13;
is paid to issues related to actually teaching a particular subject. Similarly, pedagogy and&#13;
psychology courses for teachers are largely theoretical and fail to transmit practical knowledge&#13;
such as classroom organization and management, differential pedagogy, group work,&#13;
communication in the classroom or conflict resolution. Neither pre-service nor in-service teacher&#13;
training in Moldova have provided teachers with exposure to alternative methodologies and&#13;
approaches to learning now predominant in most developed countries. Teachers are largely&#13;
unfamiliar with the new approaches to learning and teaching which the new curricula intend to&#13;
promote. Effective in-service training which will help expose teachers to new approaches and&#13;
methodologies, particularly those focusing on student centered and formative education, will be&#13;
essential to improving the educational quality in the years to come.&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
2.    The in-service teacher training component of the proposed project aims at providing key&#13;
rayon education directorate staff and teachers with the necessary background to effectively&#13;
implement the new curricula and assessment methods and thus improve the quality of classroom&#13;
teaching.&#13;
Component Overview&#13;
3.    The successful introduction of new curricula, teaching materials and assessment methods&#13;
will largely depend on how well teachers are prepared to implement the new curricula and use new&#13;
materials. Successful implementation of the new curricula will thus require the provision of in-&#13;
service training for about 45,000 general education teachers and school administrators -- 12,000 at&#13;
the primary level (grades 1-4) and 33,000 at the secondary level (grades 5-1 1), plus about 1,700&#13;
central and regional staff and teacher trainers, all of whom will require special training on the new&#13;
curricula, textbooks, teaching materials, and modern teaching and assessment methodology. The&#13;
required training will need to be implemented over a four-year period in conjunction with other&#13;
aspects of the reform program. In response to this unusually high demand for teacher retraining&#13;
under the reform program, the Ministry has restructured its in-service training agency (now the&#13;
National Institute for Teacher Retraining -- INPCD) and given it responsibility for in-service&#13;
training of only teachers, as opposed to other non-teaching staff in the sector.&#13;
4.    The INPCD will have responsibility for planning, developing, and coordinating overall&#13;
implementation of the teacher retraining program for the education reform effort and ensuring its&#13;
ultimate success. The INPCD will work with, and coordinate the reform efforts of, a group of five&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
ANNEX1[&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
teacher training institutions which comprise an in-service teacher training network1 with special&#13;
strengths in different teaching subjects and levels. The Network will train the individuals (rayon&#13;
methodologists, inspectors, selected school directors and teachers) who will serve as teacher&#13;
trainers for this project.&#13;
5.      Training will occur at three levels. First, the INPCD, assisted by the working groups&#13;
developing the new curricula and the student assessment system, will train its own staff and the&#13;
staff of the network teacher training institutions (training of central trainers). Second, these staff&#13;
will train selected methodologists, inspectors, school directors and teachers of the 45 rayon&#13;
education directorates for their intended job of training the local teachers (training of local trainers).&#13;
Third, local trainers will train teachers in their respective rayons. This "cascading" model is&#13;
important because it uses the existing structure and adapts its strengths and functions to the new&#13;
challenges of the education reform. It is also the most cost-effective way of providing such a large&#13;
number of teachers with in-service training. Short-course upgrade training of teachers is a normal&#13;
function of the methodology and inspector departments in the rayon education directorates, whereas&#13;
in-service training of a more intensive nature, e.g., summer courses, is normally carried out by the&#13;
network institutions. Teachers are required by law to participate in MEYS prescribed in-service&#13;
refresher/update training at least once each five years. The training to be provided through this&#13;
program (initial and follow-up courses) will meet the five-year retraining requirement for one five-&#13;
year period.&#13;
6.      The specific in-service training process proposed under the project supplements and&#13;
enhances the existing in-service training program in Moldova in that it moves the major teaching&#13;
effort from the central to the regional (rayon) level and thus strengthens the capacity of rayon&#13;
education directorate staff as resource persons for teachers. It also assures a healthy relationship&#13;
between the new curricula, textbooks, and assessment procedures on the one hand, and the teacher&#13;
in-service training process on the other, all in the framework of the education reform.&#13;
7.      Training for central trainers at the primary and secondary school level will be carried out at&#13;
[NPCD. Three two-person teams of central trainers for primary school training will be required to&#13;
teach the 181 local trainers for primary school. The initial training for primary school central&#13;
trainers will last two weeks, the follow-up training one week. Nineteen two-person teams and one&#13;
four person team of central trainers at secondary school level will be trained in subject-area groups.&#13;
These teams will subsequently carry out the training of the 1390 local trainers for secondary school.&#13;
Their initial training course will last one week, the follow-up course three days.&#13;
8.      Local trainers (i.e. rayon methodologists, inspectors, selected school directors and teachers)&#13;
will be trained in residential courses as follows: the 181 primary local trainers will be trained in 7&#13;
courses (distributed between INPCD and Aleco Ruso State University in Balti) by the three two-&#13;
person teams of central trainers. Initial courses will be 2 week residential courses taught over a&#13;
period of 2 months. Follow-up courses will last 1 week.&#13;
The five teacher training institutions whose in-service training programs will be carried out under the management&#13;
and coordination umbrella of the INPCD are:&#13;
Ion Creangu Pedagogical University, Chisinau&#13;
National Institute for In-Service Teacher Training (INPCD), Chisinau&#13;
Aleco Ruso State University, Balti&#13;
State University of Tiraspol, Chisinau&#13;
National Institute of Physical Education and Sport&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

,ANNEXIV&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
9.     Secondary school local trainers will be divided among the five different institutions for&#13;
their residential training, in accordance with the specialization or strengths of the different&#13;
institutions.2 Initial training courses will last one week, follow-up courses 3 days.&#13;
10.    Each primary teacher will receive two weeks of initial training in hands-on type workshop&#13;
groups of about 25 teachers each during the summer preceding implementation of the curricula and&#13;
materials for his/her respective grade level. This will be supplemented two years later by an&#13;
additional week of follow-up training, at which time the teachers will have had sufficient&#13;
experience in implementing the new curriculum, textbooks, and other teaching materials to be well&#13;
aware of any program shortcomings which need to be corrected. During the follow-up courses, the&#13;
teachers will be asked to critique the curricula and textbooks and to suggest ways for resolving any&#13;
major problems which may have been identified.&#13;
11.    Primary teachers begin and stay with a cohort of students from grade 1 through grade 4, so&#13;
their training is more general and comprehensive, while secondary teacher training is subject&#13;
specific and more concentrated. For this reason, the secondary teachers will be taught in subject&#13;
specific groups and receive only one week (6 days) of initial training, also in the summer just prior&#13;
to implementation of their respective new curricula and textbooks, plus 3 days of follow-up training&#13;
two years later. Altogether, considering both initial and follow-up training of teachers and staff for&#13;
all grade levels and subjects, a total cf over 3, 700 courses/workshops will be taught during the first&#13;
four years of the project, providing at least two upgrade/refresher training opportunities for more&#13;
than 45,000 teachers and administrators and 1,700 central staff.&#13;
Teacher Traininz Content and Format&#13;
12.    The format and content of the teacher training program will be detailed and refined by the&#13;
INPCD and the curriculum and assessment working groups, assisted by a technical assistance&#13;
specialist in teacher training curriculum and program development. However, the preliminary&#13;
content outline of the planned training is as indicated below:&#13;
Module A - General Training&#13;
*      Management of Change&#13;
*      School Improvement Techniques&#13;
*      Classroom Organization and Management&#13;
*      Communication in the Classroom&#13;
*      Innovative Teaching Strategies&#13;
*      Active Learning Techniques&#13;
*      Managing Pluralism in Mixed Classes and Schools&#13;
2 The distribution will likely be as follows:&#13;

Module B - Subject Specific Training&#13;
*      The New Curriculum&#13;
-     The new curriculum concept&#13;
-     Curriculum and program structure&#13;
-     New content elements&#13;
-      Learning contexts and opportunities&#13;
-     Methodology suggestions for teachers&#13;
*      The New Textbooks&#13;

-     Didactic style of content&#13;
-     Methodological approach&#13;
*     The New Assessment Procedures&#13;
-     Types of educational assessment&#13;
-     Methodology of applying and processing results of assessments&#13;
-      Formative and summative assessment&#13;
-     New format for organizing and managing examinations&#13;
13.   The "initial course" outline for regional trainers and local teachers includes a short teaching&#13;
mit on "The New Assessment Procedures". The staff and technical assistance consultants for the&#13;
project component "Development of a Learning Assessment System" will prepare the curriculum&#13;
and instructional materials for this teaching unit and teach it to the central trainers.&#13;
12.    Local teachers will participate in workshops to be held in their own rayon, to be conducted&#13;
by local trainers from their rayon. Teachers who reside in Chisinau will commute from home each&#13;
day for the training. Of those living in other rayons/towns it is estimated that 25 % will need to be&#13;
accommodated in local school residences during their participation in the workshops. A housing&#13;
allowance of 5 lei per night will be paid to the latter group, in addition to the standard subsistence&#13;
allowance paid to all others. One or more staff members of the INPCD, the Network institutions, or&#13;
the curriculum and assessment working groups will participate in most of the local workshops as&#13;
resource persons.&#13;
Required Materials and Equipment&#13;
13.   In addition to the costs of holding the actual training courses, there will be a need for&#13;
equipment and materials. Proposed equipment needs are the bare minimum as follows:&#13;
INPCD Requirements:        computers, printers, heavy duty photo copiers, overhead&#13;
projectors, TV set and VCR, training videos&#13;
Other training institutions:  TV set and VCR, training videos&#13;
Per Rayon Requirements:     1 medium duty photocopier, 1 overhead projector&#13;
&#13;

Technical Assistance&#13;
14.    Training curricula and instructional materials for training at all levels will need to be&#13;
prepared early during the project. In the interim between project appraisal and project start-up,&#13;
more detailed work on implementation strategy and scheduling will be carried out. Both efforts&#13;
will require considerable international technical assistance (TA) which must be brought in very&#13;
early in the program. The INPCD has programmed three consultants (a total of 7 staff months) to&#13;
assist in this effort.  These consultants will comprise:  (a) a planning and organizational&#13;
management specialist for one month; (b) a teacher training curriculum and training specialist, with&#13;
focus on modern teaching methodologies for primary education for 3 months; and, (c) a teacher&#13;
training curriculum and training specialist with focus on modem teaching technologies for&#13;
secondary schools for 3 months.&#13;
15.    The specific responsibilities of the consultants would be as follows:&#13;
*  Program/Project Planning Specialist: to assist INPCD and the other teacher training&#13;
institutions in developing:&#13;
- technical guidelines for the teacher re-training program,&#13;
- national plan for continuing teacher training,&#13;
- national strategy for implementing long-range training program,&#13;
- scheduling for short- and long-term in-service training program, and&#13;
- management procedures for initiating and maintaining the program.&#13;
*  Teacher Training Curriculum and Training Specialist - Primary: to assist INPCD and&#13;
the other teacher training institutions in developing the structure, and content of&#13;
curricula and materials for training the central and local trainers and teachers and to&#13;
teach modules for central trainers on modem teaching methodologies.&#13;
*  Teacher Training Curriculum and Training Specialist - Secondary: to assist INPCD&#13;
and the other teacher training institutions in developing the structure, and content of&#13;
curricula and materials for training the central and local trainers and teachers and to&#13;
teach modules for central trainers on modern teaching methodologies.&#13;

MOLDOVA GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Textbook Development Component&#13;
Current Situation&#13;
1.    Textbook shortage. The profound political changes in the early 1990s left the Moldovan&#13;
education system confronted with the need to replace previous, often ideologized, textbooks. This need&#13;
was reinforced by the shift from Cyrillic to Roman script and will become even more critical as the new&#13;
curriculum will be introduced. Mainly due to resource constraints, textbook replacements have so far&#13;
taken place on a piecemeal basis, with the result that there remains a significant shortage of textbooks in&#13;
schools and that those textbooks which are currently in use often do not correspond to the new needs of&#13;
the Moldovan education system. A wide variety of books are currently used, including books from&#13;
Romania and Russia, reprints of old Moldovan textbooks, new textbooks published in Moldova since&#13;
1990 and books from Bulgaria, Ukraine and Gagauzia for minorities. The introduction of new curricula&#13;
will require the parallel introduction of corresponding new textbooks in sufficient quantities to allow for&#13;
effective teaching and learning.&#13;
2.    Budgetary resources available for textbooks have been extremely limited over the past few&#13;
years: over the last three years an average of slightly over $100,000 was available for textbooks from&#13;
the budget. The 1996 budget allocates about US$ 2.5 million equivalent for textbooks, but the tight&#13;
budgetary situation has only permitted to disburse somewhat over 10% of this amount during the first&#13;
six months of the year and it is unlikely that the full amount budgeted will become available during the&#13;
rest of the year. It is unlikely that this situation will substantially change over the next few years and&#13;
that the Government will be able to introduce new textbooks in support of its education reform without&#13;
substantial external assistance.&#13;
3.    Textbook Production. Development of new textbooks has so far occurred under a rather closed&#13;
system. Authors are hand picked by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports (MEYS) and are&#13;
largely limited to staff of the Institute for Pedagogical and Psychological Studies (IPPS). In most cases&#13;
the same people who write the curriculum also write the textbook. Although there are instances where&#13;
other authors have developed a manuscript, these manuscripts have never been given serious&#13;
consideration by the Ministry as they were developed on an unsolicited basis. Textbook publication is&#13;
largely ensured by the State Textbook Publishers, who do not obtain any subsidies. The state publisher&#13;
for general education textbooks is in a precarious situation, due to the significant decrease in the volume&#13;
ordered by MEYS and the substantial debt accumulated by the Ministry. Although there is a growing&#13;
number of local publishers, their experience in textbook publishing remains extremely limited, as they&#13;
have virtually no access to Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports contracts. There is, however,&#13;
substantial interest on behalf of private publishers to become active in the textbook market, provided the&#13;
Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports will be able to submit timely payments. However, in order to&#13;
produce high quality textbooks, these publishers would require substantial technical assistance during&#13;
the initial years.&#13;
4.    Given the small market for textbooks in Moldova, it is not likely that many, if any, foreign&#13;
publishers will develop an interest in this market. If Moldova is to have an assured supply of quality&#13;
textbooks, it is therefore of great importance that the local industry be allowed to develop and adapt to&#13;
market conditions. Book prices in Moldova are very cheap by international standards, a typical Grade 2&#13;
book costs about US$ 1 equivalent, while a secondary school book is about $ 1.40 equivalent. This is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
ANNEXV&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
between 25% and 40% cheaper than even in neighboring Romania. However, if the experience of other&#13;
transition economies is an indication at all, prices are expected to increase quite substantially in the&#13;
medium to long term.&#13;
5.    There is substantial printing capacity in Moldova, primarily ensured by state printing houses&#13;
which do not receive any subsidies. The main printer for textbooks has substantial experience and&#13;
produces high quality books, both for the public sector and the private market. In general, however, the&#13;
printing capacity in Moldova is of the wrong sort for current print requirements, because it is geared to&#13;
large print runs. A minimum production of 25,000 copies for four colour books and a minimum run of&#13;
10,000 copies for 1-2 colour books is required for economical production with current technology.&#13;
While this is not an issue for the production of Romanian and Russian language school books, it will be&#13;
an issue for books in minority languages and teacher guides which require much smaller print runs.&#13;
6.    Textbook Distribution. Textbook distribution to schools is ensured through Mold Didactica, an&#13;
entity owned by MEYS. Mold Didactica was restructured in 1992 to resemble a commercial firm and is&#13;
now self-financing. Mold Didactica distributes books according to an allocation list from the Ministry&#13;
to the rayon education department which then distributes the books to schools. The number of books&#13;
ordered for each title is decided by the Ministry's Library and Didactic Materials Assistance department&#13;
based on current student enrollments. While this is an adequate way to estimate the requirements of an&#13;
original print run, it is not appropriate for estimating the need in later reprints and replacements.&#13;
7.    Textbook Financing. A fundamental problem in the supply of textbooks is the lack of a&#13;
sustainable textbook financing mechanism. The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports no longer has&#13;
the budgetary resources to guarantee adequate annual supplies nor development of new materials needed&#13;
for a modem education system. While external funding can help mitigate the immediate crisis by&#13;
supporting the development of new textbooks, it is critical that a mechanism which permits sustainable&#13;
textbook financing in the long run be introduced as soon as possible, so as to assure that reprints can be&#13;
produced and books updated as the need arises after completion of foreign assistance. The Government&#13;
is therefore planning on introducing a cost recovery mechanism for textbooks. The mechanism would&#13;
consist of charging students a book rental fee which would allow cost recovery of a grade specific book&#13;
set over the life of the books. This mechanism would assure independent resources for textbook&#13;
financing, while keeping the amounts to be charged to a particular student as low as possible. The&#13;
proposed project would support introduction of such a system.&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
8.    The component's objectives are three fold: (i) to provide schools with an adequate number of&#13;
quality textbooks in accordance with the new curricula in key subject areas; (ii) to establish a&#13;
sustainable and transparent textbook supply system, and (iii) to establish a sustainable textbook&#13;
financing mechanisms.&#13;
Component Design&#13;
9.    The strategy is to finance the publishing and supply of priority textbooks and teacher guides in line&#13;
with new curricula for mandatory general education over the five years of the project, while gradually&#13;
introducing a cost-recovery system. It would assist the local publishing industry to adapt to emerging&#13;
market economy conditions by providing training, access to MEYS textbook contracts, and a payment&#13;
regime which would allow competent publishers to take part.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
ANNEXV&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
10.   The Textbook Development Component would therefore (i) finance the supply of an agreed list of&#13;
textbooks and teacher guides for both Romanian medium and non-Romanian medium schools to support&#13;
the new curricula being developed in grades 3-9 of general education, (ii) support cost recovery from&#13;
textbook users, and (iii) train Moldovan publishers, rayon education department staff and MEYS staff to&#13;
perform their new or modified tasks concerned with textbook supply and cost recovery.&#13;
Supply of Textbooks and Teacher Guides.&#13;
11.   Titles. The project would finance the production and distribution of textbooks and teacher guides&#13;
in key subject areas in line with the new curricula for grades 3-9. New textbooks for grades 1 and 2 will be&#13;
financed by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports budget prior to project effectiveness. Books will&#13;
be published in Romanian and minority languages. In addition, the project would attempt to provide for&#13;
native language books in minority schools (Gagauzian, Ukrainian, and Bulgarian). Other books for&#13;
minority schools (other than Russian) will be financed by the Ministry's budget, once a clear policy as to&#13;
the language of instruction for subjects other than native language has been agreed upon with the minority&#13;
schools. An indicative list of the book titles to be financed is shown in table 1 below. Unit prices for&#13;
books are based on current costs in Moldova with price and physical contingencies added to determine&#13;
final costs. Should book prices prove to rise substantially faster than what is allowed for by these&#13;
contingencies (this has, for example, happened recently in Russia), the list of book titles would have to be&#13;
adjusted during project implementation in line with the available resources. The list of titles to be&#13;
produced during the time of the project is ambitious and will require close adherence to the procurement&#13;
implementation plan and close monitoring of the progress achieved each year. The limited MEYS&#13;
management and supervision capacity and the lack of experience with competitive bidding both by MEYS&#13;
and by local publishers may require downward adjustments in the number of titles to be produced,&#13;
following annual review of progress achieved.&#13;
12.   The Project will finance enough copies of each textbook to cover 130% of primary school&#13;
students studying a subject and 120% of secondary school students. The number of copies below is&#13;
based on current second grade enrolment rates as provided by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and&#13;
Sports: 62,000 for Romanian language schools and 18,500 for non-Romanian language schools.&#13;
13.   The following table summarises the books which will be financed by the Project. Except for&#13;
Gagauzian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian languages as a subject, all books for non-Romanian medium&#13;
schools will be produced mostly in Russian language.&#13;

Notes:  (1) The Project will finance enough copies of each textbook to cover 130% of primary school students studying a subject and&#13;
120% of secondary. The number of copies below is based on current second grade enrolment rates as provided by the&#13;
Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports: 62,000 for Romanian language schools and 18,500 for non-Romanian language&#13;
schools.&#13;
(2) Except for Gagauzian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian languages as a subject, all books for non-Romanian medium schools will be&#13;
produced in Russian language only.&#13;
(3) Should book prices rise singificanfly faster than inflation, the list of books to be financed under the project would have to be&#13;
curtailed during project implementation in accordance with new prices and resource availability.&#13;

14.   Procurement Arrangements.  Textbooks and accompanying teacher guides would be&#13;
procured through National Competitive Bidding, although the competition would also be advertised&#13;
in Romanian newspapers. It is expected that individual contracts will be small, under $100,000,&#13;
because it will not be possible to package together titles for different subjects or for different grades&#13;
(because these latter will mostly be bid in consecutive years). Local editorial presence will be&#13;
needed for the books for grades 4, 6-9, because publishers will be responsible for developing&#13;
manuscripts with on the spot work with teams of authors.&#13;
15.   Russian-language editions will be created by translating Romanian language originals.&#13;
According to the current copyright law in Moldova, the copyrights on all of these manuscripts will&#13;
belong to the authors. By the time the Project is underway, the copyright law may have changed to&#13;
come into line with Western practice, in which case the publisher will hold a range of publishing&#13;
rights over the author's manuscript which may include the right to translate. It will not then be&#13;
possible to invite other publishers to bid to publish translated books without the permission of the&#13;
author and/or publisher. In this case it is proposed that tenders are launched with the condition that&#13;
translated editions are only awarded to the successful publisher if it has the necessary staff and&#13;
experience; if not, the MEYS will buy the right to translate. Publishers of the Russian language&#13;
editions would then be selected by international shopping.&#13;
16.   Because of the number of books to be published, a pre-qualification stage will precede the&#13;
bidding. Annual pre-qualification of publishers will give them the right to take part in one or more&#13;
tenders in the year, depending upon the bidding timetable. Very few Moldovan publishers have had&#13;
any experience of textbook publishing contracts as this has been reserved mainly for the State&#13;
Publisher. Since they have few school book publishing contracts, they would have few relevant&#13;
staff (editors, designers) with experience in this area. Their financial position is weak and they&#13;
would be incapable of financing the number of textbooks required by the MEYS. The pre-&#13;
qualification documents will have to take this into account.&#13;
17.   The bidding for textbooks will follow one of two scenarios:&#13;
(a)    Competition to publish an IPPS manuscript which has gone through the approval process.&#13;
No time is allowed for the writing of the manuscript within the bidding process. Publishers&#13;
bid to use the IPPS manuscripts. The publishing plans will be evaluated against each other.&#13;
The time from bid announcement to finished copies will be about 12 months. Books for&#13;
grades 3 and 5, for which manuscripts have been substantially completed will be bid in this&#13;
way.&#13;
(b)    Competition to develop and publish a manuscript. Time is allowed for a synopsis and 25%&#13;
of the manuscript to be written and to be submitted with the publishing plan as the&#13;
publisher's bid. The synopses, part-manuscripts and publishing plans are evaluated against&#13;
each other. The time for this scenario will be about 24 months. Books for grades 4, 6, 7, 8&#13;
and 9 will be bid in this way.&#13;
18.   The proposed mechanisms for selection of textbook authors and publishers is novel to&#13;
Moldova and will require substantial technical assistance to help guide both, the MEYS and&#13;
interested publishers through the bidding process. The advantage, however, is that it will render the&#13;
selection process for authors and publishers transparent and provide a chance for potential authors&#13;
and publishers who have so far not had access to MEYS contracts to participate in the process.&#13;
This will help develop the local textbook authorship and publication industry.&#13;

19.    The agreed upon timetable for launching textbook bids and introducing them in schools is&#13;
as follows:&#13;
date           pro-qualification      bidding             books in schools&#13;
March 1997     for grades 3 and 4&#13;
Apr 1997                              grade 3&#13;

March 2000     for grades 8 and 9&#13;
May 2000                              grades 8 and 9&#13;
Sept 2000                                                 grade 6&#13;
Sept. 2001                                                grade 7&#13;
Sept. 2002                                                grades 8 and 9&#13;
20.    Because of the difficult financial position of Moldovan publishers, State and private, and&#13;
the difficulty in getting bank loans, Moldovan publishers will not be charged for bidding&#13;
documents. Further, giving successful publishers advances to publish contracted books will not be&#13;
helpful because a bank guarantee is required by the World Bank and the publisher can only get a&#13;
bank guarantee by depositing the amount of money to be guaranteed. The bidding documents will&#13;
not therefore require too much financial outlay from the publisher and successful publishers will&#13;
receive advance payments up to a total of 70% of the contracted price on production of a publisher's&#13;
proforma invoice accompanied by the supplier's invoice (for artwork, paper and printing).&#13;
21.    Bid Evaluation Mechanisms. Like the rest of procurement under the project, the bidding&#13;
process for textbooks will be managed by the Project Management Unit (PMU). However, inputs&#13;
to the bidding documents (e.g., specific titles, number of copies, delivery points, etc.) and&#13;
supervision of ongoing printing contracts for quality assurance and progress monitoring will be the&#13;
responsibility of MEYS Department of Library Assistance and Didactic Materials, which is&#13;
currently in charge of the entire textbook supply process.&#13;
22.    The pre-qualification stage will be evaluated by an ad hoc Bidding Evaluation&#13;
Committee (BEC) of 7-8 members representing MoEd, curriculum development, finance (MEYS&#13;
budget department), MEYS pre-university general education department, MEYS Didactic&#13;
assistance and libraries department, teacher training, the project director, the project&#13;
&#13;

implementation advisor and, possibly, from outside the MEYS 1 or 2 parents. Only publishers&#13;
who meet the pre-qualification criteria will be invited to submit a proposal.&#13;
23.    Prequalification evaluation criteria of publishers will be:&#13;
*  Number of years as a publisher&#13;
*  Publishing experience&#13;
*  Local premises&#13;
*  Publishing staff&#13;
*  Financial autonomy&#13;
*  Marketing and distribution&#13;
24.    The information about each publisher's qualifications, experience and capacity will be&#13;
evaluated on a scale "inadequate-adequate-good". Publishers scoring at least "adequate" on each&#13;
item will be prequalified to bid and will receive the bidding documents for the forthcoming&#13;
tender. The BEC will evaluate publishers either as acceptable or unacceptable or as acceptable for&#13;
certain types of books only.&#13;
25.    Tender submissions from prequalified bidders will be evaluated by the Bidding Evaluation&#13;
Committee (see above), based on inputs provided by the Manuscript Evaluation Committee (MEC).&#13;
The MECs will be set up for each subject for which textbooks sought. Each MEC will consist of 4&#13;
members, as much as practical drawn from the Curriculum Development Working Groups and&#13;
Coordination Commissions and will consist of: 1 curriculum development specialist, 1 teacher&#13;
trainer, 2 teachers. The teachers should teach at an appropriate level for the textbook proposals to&#13;
be evaluated and the curriculum specialist should come from the relevant discipline. If relevant&#13;
teacher representatives are not available from within the curriculum development structure, they&#13;
will be drawn from elsewhere. MEC members will be responsible for the initial evaluation of a&#13;
submitted manuscript and for subsequent review of a finished manuscript before the go ahead for&#13;
printing the book is awarded by MEYS. Members of the MECs will be paid fees for the bid&#13;
evaluation work at the rate of $25 per member per MEC. This fee will cover both the work for the&#13;
bid evaluation and then the subsequent checking that the publisher has revised or completed the&#13;
manuscript as required.&#13;
26.    Bid Evaluation Criteria for grade 3 and 5 manuscripts: Manuscripts are provided by the&#13;
IPPS and will have gone through the MEYS approval process. Therefore, the bid evaluation will&#13;
consist of the two main categories:&#13;
* Presentation and design: 60% of marks, evaluated by the MECs&#13;
* Price: 40% of marks, evaluated by the BEC&#13;
"Presentation and design" will be broken down by the MECs into detailed criteria such as:&#13;
* page layout;&#13;
* size and style of type used;&#13;
* general readability;&#13;
* spacing, margins, clarity;&#13;
* standard of illustration;&#13;
* relationship between text and illustrations;&#13;
* accuracy of illustrations; and&#13;
* use of colour (if requested in the technical specifications).&#13;

27.    Bid Evaluation Criteria for Grades 4. 6. 7, 8. and 9: Publishers will propose their own&#13;
manuscripts and so these will be evaluated in addition to the factors listed above:&#13;
* Quality of manuscript: 40% of marks, evaluated by the MECs&#13;
*  Presentation and design: 20% of marks, evaluated by the MECs&#13;
* Price: 40% of marks, evaluated by the BEC&#13;
"Quality of manuscript" will be broken down by the MECs into detailed criteria in each of the&#13;
following categories:&#13;
*  conformity to the new curriculum - 12%&#13;
*  educational objectives - 6%&#13;
*  methodology - 6%&#13;
*  scope and sequence - 4%&#13;
*  language and concepts - 2%&#13;
*  content - 6%&#13;
*  cultural background - 2%&#13;
*  adequacy of number of illustrations - 2%&#13;
28.    A threshold number of points for "Quality of manuscript" as a whole - say 25 out of 40 -&#13;
must be achieved by any manuscript for it to continue in the evaluation; and also for the category&#13;
"Conformity to curriculum" - say 10 out of 12 points. Presentation and design will be rated by the&#13;
same criteria as those for grades 3 and 5.&#13;
Textbook Financing Mechanism&#13;
29.    The Project would assist the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports with the&#13;
introduction of a textbook rental system, the proceeds of which will be deposited into a Textbook&#13;
Fund which would then provide ready finance to purchase further copies of textbooks for&#13;
distribution to schools as needed. Books to be financed by the project would be delivered to&#13;
schools where they would be stored in the school library and lent for an annual loan fee to&#13;
students for one school year. For primary classes, at least four cohorts of students would use the&#13;
books so that the cost per student would be about one quarter of the total purchase cost of the books&#13;
(including distribution costs). For secondary classes, five cohorts of students would use the books&#13;
and the cost per student would then be about one fifth of the purchase price of the set of books.&#13;
30.    The rental fee would be based on the purchase price of a replacement set of books delivered&#13;
to the rayons. The replacement cost is the cost in 4-5 years' time based on today's procurement&#13;
costs plus expected price increases until the books are reprinted, plus delivery charges. The rental&#13;
charge should be a sum to cover the required cost recovery for a set of books, not individual books,&#13;
to simplify the system.&#13;
31.    At current book prices, the rental fee for a set of primary books would be around 17-20 lei&#13;
(US$1=4.57 lei) per student per year, while that for a set of secondary books would be 22-29 lei per&#13;
student per year. While these are minimal costs by international standards, there is some concern in&#13;
the Government that poor families with a large number of children might not be able to afford the&#13;
rental fee. Because income targeting in Moldova is currently extremely difficult, the selection of&#13;
children to receive support to pay the rental fee would be left to individual rayons or schools. Each&#13;
rayon would be provided with a budgetary ceiling for textbook subsidies. Initially this ceiling&#13;
would be deternined based on the number of families with three or more children which currently&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
ANNEXV&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
receive child compensation benefits, but the actual selection of children would be left up to the&#13;
rayon or school.&#13;
32.   Each spring, the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports would inform the rayon&#13;
education directorates how much the rental fee for each grade book set is and rayons would&#13;
determine how much needs to be collected by each school per grade. The collection of rental fees&#13;
would be the responsibility of each school, based on the number of students in a particular grade&#13;
and the current rental fee per grade. Schools would deposit the money collected into a centrally&#13;
managed fund through a local bank and provide evidence of payment to the rayon education&#13;
directorate. The latter would keep detailed accounts of the amount of rental fees paid in per school&#13;
per grade and compare them to the amounts expected to be collected. For this purpose each rayon&#13;
education directorate would be provided with a computer and a standardized management&#13;
information system.&#13;
33.   At least in the initial years, the textbook fund would be managed centrally by a fund&#13;
manager. It would be supervised by an interministerial (Ministries of Finance, Economy, and&#13;
Education, Youth, and Sports) committee which would have sole expenditure approval powers.&#13;
The fund would be externally audited every year and the audit results would be made public.&#13;
Funds would be used to reproduce books for which rental fees have been collected (i.e., if no fees&#13;
were collected for grade I books, resources from the textbook fund could not be used to&#13;
repurchase new copies of grade 1 books). As the system becomes well established the&#13;
Government may consider its decentralization to the rayon and eventually even to the school&#13;
level. However, this will require more intensive interaction between school and/or rayon&#13;
education directorates on one hand and publishers/book distributors on the other, than is&#13;
currently feasible in Moldova.&#13;
34.   The first supply of textbooks to the rayons within the Project would be based on&#13;
enrolment and would not depend on the number of rental fees collected. The rental fee system&#13;
would be introduced in line with the new curriculum textbooks, hence rental fees would be&#13;
introduce gradually for those grades which receive new textbooks. But after the first supply,&#13;
rayons would begin to order the number of textbooks they need from the MEYS and would&#13;
receive a number corresponding to the amount they have deposited into the Textbook Fund&#13;
account. Rayons would therefore have to develop an accurate feedback system about the&#13;
availability of books in schools so that they can order what is needed. The former problem of&#13;
rayon ordering - that the numbers required were exaggerated - would be reduced if rayons had to&#13;
pay for textbooks by depositing rental fees into the Textbook Fund. Rayon education staff would&#13;
receive training in the management of the textbook rental system.&#13;
35.   To facilitate the introduction of the rental system and assure its support by the&#13;
community, the project would also finance a publicity campaign aimed at parents and teachers to&#13;
explain the rental system.&#13;
36.   Program Support. Both the production of textbooks through award of competitive bidding&#13;
and the introduction of the textbook rental scheme will be new to Moldova. A significant amount&#13;
of technical assistance and training will be required to assure their successful introduction.&#13;
Therefore, the project will provide for technical assistance and local training in three areas: (i)&#13;
training and technical assistance to Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports staff, members of the&#13;
BEC and the MEC in the management of the bidding process, including preparation of bidding&#13;
documents, assistance with the management of the pre-qualification and bid-evaluation processes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;

and overall training courses on competitive bidding procedures for textbooks; (ii) training courses&#13;
for interested publishers on the bidding process in general and on how to handle pre-qualification&#13;
documents in particular, followed by a course on how to handle actual bids for pre-qualified&#13;
bidders; and, (iii) technical assistance and training for the implementation of the textbook financing&#13;
scheme.&#13;

MOLDOVA GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Management Unit (PMU)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be established in the Ministry of Education, Youth, and&#13;
Sports (MEYS) to coordinate the proposed project activities and to ensure that project implementation is&#13;
carried out in an effective, timely, and efficient manner in accordance with the agreed time-table and normal&#13;
Bank procedures.&#13;
2.    Overall direction of the project will be the responsibility of the First Deputy Minister who will be&#13;
guided and advised by a Project Steering Committee. The latter will be chaired by the First Deputy&#13;
Minister of Education, Youth, and Sports and have membership representation from some non-MEYS&#13;
agencies, such as the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and other relevant agencies [See Committee TOR in&#13;
Para. 5 (f)].&#13;
3.    Day-to-day management of project implementation and PMU support activities are delegated to the&#13;
Director of the PMU who reports directly to the Deputy Minister. The PMU staff will include, in addition&#13;
to the Director, a Procurement Officer (to serve also as Assistant Project Director), Financial Accountant,&#13;
Project Secretary, and a Project Advisor experienced in implementation of Bank-financed development&#13;
projects.&#13;
PMU Resonsibilities&#13;
4.    Project Management and Supervision.  The PMU will be responsible for the coordination,&#13;
supervision, and monitoring of project implementation, ensuring compliance with Bank requirements for&#13;
procurement, maintaining project accounts, arranging (with the Ministry of Finance) for account audits,&#13;
reporting on implementation progress, and other activities as agreed with the World Bank. Specific&#13;
activities to be carried out by the PMU include, but are not limited to, the following:&#13;
(a) General Proiect Management. In addition to providing administrative support for project&#13;
development activities as indicated above, the PMU will prepare annual and quarterly work&#13;
plans for the project in accordance with the agreed implementation plan. It will also prepare&#13;
annual and quarterly project budgets and ensure that the required counterpart funds are&#13;
included in the MEYS annual budget request. PMU staff will coordinate the planning and&#13;
implementation of all technical assistance and fellowship training, manage the procurement of&#13;
equipment, textbooks, materials and special project services, provide logistical support for&#13;
project activities, handle disbursement of Bank and counterpart funds and maintain project&#13;
financial accounts.&#13;
(b) Collection and Analysis of Project Information. The PMU will initiate and manage the&#13;
collection and processing of project achievement indicators (input, process, and output) on a&#13;
periodic basis as agreed with the Bank. Information from different elements of the project will&#13;
be forwarded regularly to the PMU for consolidation and analysis in terms of project inputs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

processes, and other monitoring indicators by the departments in charge of implementing&#13;
individual project components. Periodic reports will be provided to the various project entities&#13;
and forwarded to relevant departments of the Ministry for their general information on&#13;
implementation progress and for planning future activities and resource allocations. Formal&#13;
project reporting will also include the submission of quarterly progress reports to the Project&#13;
Steering Committee and semi-annual progress reports to the Bank. This will allow for periodic&#13;
evaluation of implementation activities and provide a basis for adjustments in project plans and&#13;
resource allocations as necessary.&#13;
(c) Mid-Term Project Review. A project mid-term review will be organized and carried out jointly&#13;
by the PMU and the Bank, in consultation with the various project entities and appropriate&#13;
MEYS agencies. In preparation of the joint GovemmentlBank mid-term review, the PMU will&#13;
prepare a detailed implementation progress report, stating implementation achievements and&#13;
problems and making suggestions for changes, if needed. The joint Government/Bank review,&#13;
to be carried out no later than 2 years after project effectiveness, will assess the progress of&#13;
project implementation and recommend adjustments as deemed appropriate for ensuring&#13;
achievement of project objectives.  A copy of the mid-term  review report, including&#13;
recommended actions for improvement, will be submitted to MEYS, the Project Steering&#13;
Commitee and Bank management for review, comments, and concurrence.&#13;
(d) Implementation Completion Report (ICRU Upon project completion, the PMU, in consultation&#13;
with the Bank, will prepare an ICR which describes the project implementation experience,&#13;
including implementation problems and successes and lessons learned from the operation. The&#13;
report will be submitted to the MEYS management, Ministries of Finance and Economy, other&#13;
interested agencies of the Government, and ultimately the World Bank, for review and&#13;
comment.&#13;
4.    Coordination, The PMU will prepare annual and quarterly work plans [see para. 3 (a)] which&#13;
ensure that all project entities operate in a coordinated manner. The PMU will coordinate scheduling of all&#13;
project activities to ensure that they are mutually supporting and implemented in such a way as to engender&#13;
efficient use of human and financial resources. The PMU will also coordinate activities among other&#13;
internal/external agencies, organizations and other potential donor agencies which may be interested in&#13;
supporting the project efforts.&#13;
5.    General Implementation Support. The above-listed activities will be carried out by the PMU staff&#13;
who will provide general technical support as indicated below in the PMU staff terms of reference.&#13;
(a) Project Diretor. A project of this nature, with several components, requires strong and&#13;
effective leadership, with a high degree of coordination, in order to be successfully&#13;
implemented. The PMU, due to the support services it provides, is the hub of project activity&#13;
and the Project Director is the key person in assuring that the project is, in fact, successful. The&#13;
person who is selected for the Project Director position must have a strong background in&#13;
education (both training and experience) and a relatively high level of experience (4-5 years) in&#13;
managing complex operations which include both product outputs and personnel functions.&#13;
The Director must know about and be expert in all aspects of project implementation, i.e.,&#13;
teaching, planning, organizing, scheduling, curriculum and instructional materials development&#13;
and testing, budgeting, procurement, problem analysis, evaluation, etc. This must be an&#13;
individual who is outgoing, energetic, and dynamic, and one who relates well to other people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
ANNEXVI&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
It must be a person who understands and respects the intricacies of government bureaucracy&#13;
and knows how to work within the system to get things done. The person to be appointed must&#13;
be one who appreciates high quality work, who has a respect for schedules and deadlines, and&#13;
who takes pride in completing productive tasks in a timely manner (on time). The person must&#13;
also have been closely associated with project preparation and have a good overview of&#13;
proposed project activities. The Bank reserves the right to comment on the credentials of the&#13;
person proposed for appointment to the Project Director position and to concur in his/her&#13;
appointment. There may be difficulty in identifying and recruiting an individual with sufficient&#13;
knowledge, skills, and experience in these areas since this will be the first World Bank financed&#13;
project in the sector. It will therefore be necessary to bring in an experienced implementation&#13;
advisor [see para. 5 (b) below], at least in the beginning of project implementation (years I and&#13;
2), who can assist the Director in assuring that implementation takes place on a high quality&#13;
level and continues on schedule.&#13;
(b) Project Advisor. In order to strengthen local capacity for project implementation in the&#13;
education sector and assist the Project Director with the initial project activities, a project&#13;
implementation advisor, with substantial experience in project work, will be employed during&#13;
the first year and possibly extended the following year to assist the Project Director in&#13;
managing the project. The individual selected should have a strong background in education&#13;
(both training and experience) with at least 4-5 years in managing such projects. The person&#13;
must have had experience in and be familiar with implementation of World Bank-financed&#13;
projects and be knowledgeable of Bank requirements and procedures for such operations. As&#13;
an advisor, this person must have expertise in project planning, scheduling, procurement&#13;
(including preparation of bidding documents and contracts, preparation of tender&#13;
announcements, evaluating equipment and textbooks bids and technical assistance proposals in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines and standards), personnel management, financial&#13;
management, project evaluation, report writing, etc. Proficiency in the English language is&#13;
required and moderate capability in Romanian and/or Russian would be helpful. It is expected&#13;
that the Advisor will present a number of training seminars on project management during the&#13;
assignment period. This person will be needed for a total of at least two years (24 person-&#13;
months), at which time the local projects staff should have built up sufficient capacity to&#13;
continue with smooth implementation of the project. The Bank reserves the right to comment&#13;
on the credentials of the person proposed for appointment to the Project Advisor position and to&#13;
concur on his/her appointment.&#13;
(c) Procurement Officer. This person should be thoroughly familiar with World Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines and procedures in order to manage procurement under the project. All procurement&#13;
actions for the project will be consolidated under the responsibility of the PMU in order to&#13;
maximize economies of scale and savings in accordance with World Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines and procedures for goods and consultant services. The Procurement Officer will&#13;
implement all actions of a procurement nature and advise the Project Director in all&#13;
procurement matters. This person will also assist the Project Director in communicating to the&#13;
Bank any procurement-related problems or issues. Services of the Procurement Officer, who&#13;
will also serve as Assistant Project Director, will be needed through the entire project&#13;
implementation period, as textbook and some equipment procurement will continue throughout&#13;
the full life of the project. The individual selected for this position will need to participate in&#13;
procurement courses which the Bank will provide in the Eastern European Region and will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
ANNEXV&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
need to be proficient in written and spoken English, as procurement documents must be&#13;
prepared in both English and the language of the country.&#13;
(d) Financial Accountant, Project accounts and records (both Loan and counterpart accounts) must&#13;
be maintained in a very professional manner with attention to accuracy and precision, and in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for project accounting. The accounts will be kept in&#13;
such a way as to meet standard auditing requirements. The person selected for assignment to&#13;
this position must be well-trained and experienced in modem bookkeeping and accounting&#13;
methods and knowledgeable of standard international auditing procedures. The person must be&#13;
proficient in the use of computers and modem accounting software, or be receptive to&#13;
participating in a training program for this purpose. As the work-load for this position is&#13;
expected to be less than full-time, the individual will be hired on a part-time (50%) basis after&#13;
concurrence with the Bank on the person's qualifications. Special arrangemenms should be&#13;
made early in project implementation for the selected accountant to participate in the&#13;
accounting course provided in the Eastern European Region by the Bank's Audits Department.&#13;
(e) Translator/Administrative Assistant  The PMU must have a capable and experienced&#13;
administrative assistant with fluency in English to carry out translations and office support&#13;
functions. Because the translator/administrative assistant will be the first point of contact for&#13;
visitors and communications from the World Bank and other important organizations, most of&#13;
which will be in English, he/she must be proficient in the English language and have prior&#13;
experience with oral and written translation to and from English as well as with preparing&#13;
correspondence in English. The person selected for this position must furthermore be&#13;
knowledgeable and experienced in the use of office technology, i.e., computer applications&#13;
(particularly word processing, database, and spreadsheet work), as well as the preparation and&#13;
sending of faxes and electronic mail, and the operation of copy machines. This person also&#13;
must be an experienced keyboard user who can prepare high quality reports and other&#13;
documents in a timely manner.&#13;
(f) Project Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is intended to provide a broad overview&#13;
of the project, bringing valuable ideas and support from outside the education sector. The&#13;
Committee is expected to oversee and guide the activities of the project. Regularly check&#13;
project progress and recommend corrective actions as necessary. The Committee is expected&#13;
to develop a keen interest in the project and generate interest and support among key&#13;
government officials from the other sectors. The Committee will be chaired by the First&#13;
Deputy-Minister of Education, Youth, and Sports. Membership on the Committee will include&#13;
representatives from the Ministries of Education,Youth, and Sports, Finance, and Economy, the&#13;
project director and representatives from other relevant agencies.&#13;
6.    Dissemination of Project Experiences.  Dissemination and replication of successful project&#13;
activities throughout the country is an essential responsibility of the Government. The PMU will therefore&#13;
prepare and submit progress reports regularly to the MEYS, Cabinet of Ministers, and the rayon directorates&#13;
regarding the problems experienced and lessons learned from the project. The PMU will also prepare&#13;
reports or communiques for the general public regarding project contributions to the country's education&#13;
system. In addition to regular reports, technical papers, and newsletters, the PMU, in cooperation with&#13;
selected schools, should arrange "open house" programs and demonstration visits to the respective schools&#13;
and employ other means of communications, as appropriate, to publicize the project and its contribution to&#13;
the education system.&#13;

Project Monitoring Indicators&#13;
1.    The PMU would be in charge of regular project monitoring. Monitoring reports would be&#13;
prepared based on three sets of indicators: (i) input indicators, (ii) process indicators, and (iii) output&#13;
indicators. Project input indicators would include loan and counterart funds used compared to budget,&#13;
equipment acquired, technical assistance and training inputs. Process indicators would monitor&#13;
progress in key project implementation processes, based on the implementation plan. A detailed&#13;
format for monitoring input and process indicator monitoring, acceptable to the Bank, will be&#13;
contained in the implementation manual. Output indicators to be monitored are as follows:&#13;

            Moldova - General Education Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The General Education Project aims at
            supporting the first phase of Moldova's education
            sector reforms, focusing on mandatory general education. The
            project's key objective is to modernize and improve the
            quality of primary and lower secondary education. Its four
            components consist of curriculum development, textbook
            production and financing, learning assessment, and
            in-service teacher training. The first component, curriculum
            development, comprises (1) establishing an integrated
            institutional structure for curriculum development and
            assessment/evaluation, (2) developing and establishing
            updated subject curricula for grades 1-9, and (3) supporting
            teachers with the implementation of the new curriculum. The
            learning assessment component improves the assessment and
            examination system in five key areas: (1) integrating
            assessment objectives into the new curriculum; (2) improving
            key national examinations at grades 4 and 9; (3) developing
            and disseminating assessment materials to teachers for key
            subjects; (4) training trainers in the use of these
            materials; and (5) conducting a sample-based survey of
            student achievements to compare performance before and after
            the project's implementation. The teacher training
            component will finance technical assistance, development and
            dissemination of training materials, implementation of
            centralized courses for trainers and decentralized courses
            for teachers, and provide necessary equipment. The textbook
            development and financing component will finance producing
            new textbooks and textbook guides in the mother tongue for
            core subjects for grades 3-9; support a new cost recovery
            system for textbooks; and provide training and technical
            assistance for Ministry staff, textbook evaluation
            committees, and publishers in competitive bidding
            procedures. Finally, the project will finance technical
            assistance, equipment and incremental operating costs
            necessary for project management and studies needed to
            prepare for a possible future project.
