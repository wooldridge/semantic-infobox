ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper provides a theoreticael framework to understand the way in&#13;
which exchange controls modify the behavior of the different agents in the&#13;
economy, leading to the creation of a parallel economy. It gives the neces-&#13;
sary theoretical elements to analyze this parallel economy and provides a&#13;
simple methodology to obtain relevant quarLtitative information about it.&#13;
Finally, it elaborates some of the policy implications of the existence of&#13;
such an economy.&#13;
The model developed shows that parallel market activities can be&#13;
explained through the optimizing behavior of exporters and importers.&#13;
Exporters will keep shifting their exports from official to parallel market&#13;
channels until the expected marginal benefit in both activities is the same.&#13;
Import traders will devote resources to rent-seeking activity until the moment&#13;
in which an additional unit spent in this activity is equal to the savings&#13;
derived from being able to use official channels instead of the parallel&#13;
markets. Their combined behavior determines the amount of import and export&#13;
smuggling, the level of the rent-seeking activity, and the black market&#13;
exchange rate that is consistent with an equilibrium position where no one has&#13;
any more incentives to move from their attained position.&#13;
A methodology has been developed to detect the presence and assess&#13;
the magnitude of the parallel market economy, as well as to explain its&#13;
behavior in a quantitative fashion. This methoodology is applied to Ghana, a&#13;
country in Sub-Saharan Africa, where parallel market activities seem to be&#13;
widespread and relatively open in the economy.&#13;
In the first part, a reduced form equation of the black market&#13;
exchange rate that is derived from the context of our model is estimated for&#13;
Ghana. There is a definite negative relationship between the real official&#13;
exchange rate and the black market rate in this case. By letting the real&#13;
official exchange rate appreciate, the Government of Ghana has been losing an&#13;
important amount of foreign exchange related to the exports that are now being&#13;
smuggled out of Ghana instead of going through the official channels. This&#13;
has meant an important reduction in the amount of foreign exchange allocated&#13;
to imports and, therefore, an increase in the demand for smuggled imports in&#13;
the economy.   In all, the real appreciation of the official exchange rate&#13;
seems to be very much related to the increasing importance of parallel market&#13;
activities in the economy.&#13;
The sescond part of the methodology focuses on the estimation of the&#13;
size of the parallel market economy and its evolution in time. The approach&#13;
emphasizes the fact that there is a demand for currency related to the&#13;
activities of the parallel market economy. It is based on the methodology&#13;
developed by Tanzi (1982) to estimate the underground economy in the United&#13;
States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The yearly estimates of the parallel market economy seem to indicate&#13;
a very clear trend: the government has been losing control over the economy&#13;
as more and more transactions are being diverted to the parallel markets. The&#13;
parallel market economy rose almost steadily to a 32.4 percent of the official&#13;
GDP in 1982.&#13;

CONDENSE&#13;
Cette 6tude propose un cadre th6orique destine a faire mieux&#13;
comprendre la facon dont le contr6le des changes modifie le comportement&#13;
des differents agents de l'economie, aboutissant a la creation d'une&#13;
economie parallele. Elle fournit les 6lments th6oriques necessaires pour&#13;
analyser cettes economie parallele en meme temps qu'une methode simple pour&#13;
obtenir les donn6es quantitatives pertinentes a son sujet. Enfin, elle&#13;
examine certaines des implications de l'existence d'une telle 6conomie sur&#13;
le plan des politiques.&#13;
Le modele 6labore montre que les activites du marche parallele&#13;
peuvent s'expliquer par la volonte des exportateurs et des importateurs&#13;
d'optimiser leur situation. Les exportateurs s'efforceront de faire&#13;
passer leurs exportations du march6 officiel au marche parallele tant que&#13;
les avantages marginaux attendus des deux marches ne seront pas les&#13;
memes.  Les importateurs consacreront leurs ressources a des activites&#13;
susceptibles de produire un revenu jusqu'a ce que l'unite supplementaire&#13;
depensee a de telles activites soit egale a l'6conomie qui resulterait de&#13;
la possibilit6 d'utiliser les voies officielles au lieu des march6s&#13;
paralleles. Ensemble, par leur comportement, les uns et les autres&#13;
determinent Le volume d'importations et d'exportations pass6es en&#13;
contrebande, le niveau d'activit6 a but lucratif et le taux de change du&#13;
marche noir compatible avec une position d'6quilibre oui personne n'a plus&#13;
de raison de vouloir bouger de sa position.&#13;
Une methode a ete mise au point pour deceler la presence et&#13;
6valuer l'ampleur de l1'conomie du marche parallele, ainsi que pour&#13;
expliquer son comportement de facon quantitative. Cette m6thode est&#13;
appliqu6e au Ghana, pays de l'Afrique au sud du Sahara oii les activites du&#13;
march6 parallele semblent florissantes et semblent se pratiquer d'une&#13;
maniere relativement ouverte dans l'6conomie.&#13;
Dans la premiere partie est 6tablie une estimation pour le Ghana&#13;
du taux de change sur le marche noir a partir d'une 6quation sous forme&#13;
r6duite decoulant de notre modele. I1 existe dans ce cas une relation&#13;
negative entre le taux de change officiel reel et le taux du marche noir.&#13;
En laissant le taux de change officiel r6el remonter, le Gouvernement du&#13;
Ghana a perdu un volume appr6ciable de devises du fait de la sortie en&#13;
contrebande d'exportations qui auraient da normalement emprunter les voies&#13;
officielles. Cela a entrain6 une forte reduction du volume de devises&#13;
allou6 aux importations et, par consequent, un accroissement de la demande&#13;
de produits import6s en contrebande. En somme, la remontee en valeur&#13;
reelle du taux de change officiel semble etroitement li6e a l'importance&#13;
accrue des activit6s du march6 parallele pour l'economie.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Le second volet de cette methode porte sur l'estimation de&#13;
I'ampleur de 1'economie du marche parallele et sur son 6volution dans le&#13;
temps. L'etude souligne le fait qu'il existe une demande de devises li6e&#13;
aux activites de cette 6conomie. Elle se fonde sur la methode mise au&#13;
point par Tanzi (1982) pour estimer l'6conomie clandestine aux Etats-Unis.&#13;
Les estimations annuelles de l'economie du marche parallele&#13;
semblent indiquer une tendance tres claire : l'Etat perd le contr6le de&#13;
l'6conomie a mesure qu'un nombre croissant de transactions se trouvent&#13;
detournees vers les marches paralleles. En 1982, 1'economie du marche&#13;
parallele, en hausse presque constante, a atteint 32,4 % du PIB officiel.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
Este estudio proporciona un marco te6rico para comprender la&#13;
manera en la que los controles cambiarios modifican el comportamiento de&#13;
los diverso,s agentes que actuan en la economia y conducen a la creaci6n de&#13;
una economia paralela. Brinda los elementos te6ricos necesarios para ana-&#13;
lizar esta economia paralela, asi como una metodologia simple para obtener&#13;
la informaci6n cuantitativa pertinente acerca de la misma. Finalmente,&#13;
explica en detalle algunos de los efectos en materia de politicas deriva-&#13;
dos de la existencia de tal economia paralela.&#13;
El modelo elaborado muestra que las actividades del mercado&#13;
paralelo pueden explicarse mediante el. comportamiento de los exportadores&#13;
e importadores tendiente a la optimizacion. Los exportadores persistiran&#13;
en trasladar sus exportaciones de los cauces del mercado oficial a los del&#13;
mercado paralelo hasta que el benefici4o marginal esperado en ambas activi-&#13;
dades sea el mismo. Los importadores dedicarAn recursos a actividades de&#13;
busqueda de renta hasta el momento en que una unidad adicional gastada en&#13;
tales actividades sea igual al ahorro derivado de la posibilidad de usar&#13;
cauces oficiales en vez de los del mercado paralelo. Su comportamiento&#13;
combinado determina la cantidad de contrabando de importaciones y exporta-&#13;
ciones, el nivel de actividades de bdsqueda de renta y el tipo de cambio&#13;
de mercado negro que guarde armonia con una posici6n de equilibrio en la&#13;
que nadie tenga mas incentivos para salir de la situaci6n alcanzada.&#13;
Se ha elaborado una metodologia para detectar la existencia de&#13;
la economia del mercado paralelo y evaluar su magnitud, asi como para&#13;
explicar su comportamiento de una manera cuantitativa. Esta metodologia&#13;
se ha aplicado a Ghana, pais de Africa al Sur del Sahara donde las activi-&#13;
dades del mercado paralelo parecen muy difundidas y relativamente abiertas&#13;
en la economia.&#13;
En la primera parte del estudio se calcula con respecto a Ghana&#13;
una ecuaci6n de formato reducido del tipo de cambio del mercado negro que&#13;
se desprende del contexto de nuestro modelo. Hay en este caso una rela-&#13;
ci6n negativa definida entre el tipo de cambio oficial real y el del mer-&#13;
cado negro. Al dejar que se valorice el primero de los dos, el Gobierno de&#13;
Ghana ha venido perdiendo una suma apreciable de divisas en relaci6n con&#13;
las exportaciones que ahora se realizan clandestinamente, en vez de a tra-&#13;
v6s de los cauces oficiales. Esto ha significado una reducci6n considera-&#13;
ble de la cantidad de divisas asignadas a las importaciones y, por lo&#13;
tanto, un aumento de la demanda de los productos importados clandestina-&#13;
mente.  En conjunto, la valorizaci6n real del tipo de cambio oficial&#13;
parece estar muy vinculada a la importancia creciente de las actividades&#13;
del mercado paralelo dentro de la economia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
La segunda parte de la metodologia se centra en el calculo de la&#13;
magnitud de la economia del mercado paralelo y su evoluci6n en el curso&#13;
del tiempo. El metodo destaca el hecho de que existe una demanda de&#13;
moneda vinculada a las actividades de la economia del mercado paralelo.&#13;
Se basa en la metodologia elaborada por Tanzi (1982) para calcular la eco-&#13;
nomia sumergida en los Estados Unidos.&#13;
Las estimaciones anuales de la economia del mercado paralelo&#13;
parecen indicar una tendencia claramente definida: el Gobierno ha venido&#13;
perdiendo el control sobre la economia a medida que se ha desviado hacia&#13;
el mercado paralelo un nulmero cada vez mayor de transacciones. La econo-&#13;
mia del mercado paralelo se elev6 en forma casi sostenida a un 32,4% del&#13;
PIB oficial en 1982.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The fact that economists have for so long regarded exchange controls&#13;
as "obviously nonoptimal from the resource allocation viewpoint" 1/ has&#13;
resulted in a very small amount of effort, in terms of economic theory, to&#13;
explain the behavior of economies where exchange controls are a "fact of&#13;
life." An increasing number of economists have recognized that the standard&#13;
models developed by the economic theory in the field of open macroeconomics,&#13;
which has been mainly concerned with cornvertible currencies, may not be&#13;
applicable to an economy in which there is rationing in the official foreign&#13;
exchange market. 2/ To a great extent, this has to do with the emergence of a&#13;
parallel marlket economy that is related to the imposition of exchange con-&#13;
trols. It is the purpose of this paper to take the first steps in developing&#13;
a unified analytical framework to study the behavior of economies with&#13;
exchange controls, by providing a framework to analyze parallel market&#13;
activities (i.e., smuggling of imports and exports, rent-seeking, and trading&#13;
of currencies in the black market).&#13;
In a first approximation, there is no difference in the economic&#13;
analysis of a direct quantitative restriction on imports, or an import&#13;
restriction through the use of exchange controls. The use of the more&#13;
elaborate administrative procedure of exchange controls can only be justified&#13;
to the extent to which governments find that foreign trade is more easily and&#13;
effectively controlled through the foreign exchange market. Traders need to&#13;
change from foreign to domestic money (or vice versa).&#13;
1/ A. Krueger (1983), p. 175.&#13;
2/ See, for example, Krueger (1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
This similarity falls apart the moment we consider illegal transac-&#13;
tions. A direct import quota may create incentives to smuggle imports as long&#13;
as the import-related premium outweighs the risks ensuing from the illegal&#13;
transactions. If the quota is imposed through exchange controls, then the&#13;
foreign exchange needed to smuggle goods into the country needs to be&#13;
purchased through the black market. In this case there is an incentive to&#13;
smuggle imports as long as the import premium outweighs the black market&#13;
premium together with the risks involved in illegal transactions. As has been&#13;
pointed out by the literature, direct import quotas can only create incentives&#13;
for smuggling but do not give incentives for the creation of a black market in&#13;
foreign exchange. 3/&#13;
In the case of exchange controls it is not very meaningful to pose&#13;
the question of import smuggling and its effects on welfare without exploring&#13;
the means of its finance. This possible black market aspect of smuggling is&#13;
not captured by the existing literature on smuggling in international trade.&#13;
The reason is that the analysis of smuggling has always been carried out in a&#13;
framework of trade restrictions (quotas, tariffs) and not of exchange&#13;
controls. But in the former, black markets of foreign exchange are never an&#13;
issue.&#13;
There is another phenomenon related to quantitative restrictions on&#13;
trade that has not been related either to smuggling or black markets: rent-&#13;
seeking. 4/ Anne Krueger (1974) shows how quantitative restrictions, which&#13;
3/ M. Sheikh (1976), pp. 9-10.&#13;
4/ Defined as the activity undertaken to benefit from rents or revenues&#13;
created by trade restrictions. This may involve the use of resources&#13;
such as manpower to carry out all the administrative procedures to&#13;
obtain an import license, bribes, increase of installed capacity if&#13;
this is used as an indicator by the authorities to allocate licenses,&#13;
etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
carry premiums, attract the use of resources in order to earn them. This use&#13;
of real resources entails a greater loss of welfare than a Bhagwati equivalent&#13;
tariff would. Krueger avoids in her analysis the direct relation between the&#13;
activities of smuggling and rent-seeking. With trade restrictions and no&#13;
exchange controls we can think of a "constrained importer" as having two&#13;
options to acquire its desired imports: (i) use resources to smuggle the&#13;
goods into the country and (ii) use resources to get hold of the import&#13;
license. An increase in the amount of smuggled goods decreases the import&#13;
premium of a given license and therefore diminishes the incentives for rent-&#13;
seeking. To understand rent-seeking activities it is important to relate them&#13;
to smuggling activities. Furthermore, the moment we enter into a world of&#13;
exchange controls we have to face the interrelation between smuggling, rent-&#13;
seeking and black markets.&#13;
It seems then that the theory of international trade has yet to&#13;
develop a single unifying analytical framework to study parallel market&#13;
activities. There has been an extensive amount of related work done in the&#13;
literature, but there are still some important loose ends. We now try to tie&#13;
up some of these loose ends by developing a model of exchange controls. It&#13;
brings together, through an analytical framework, the phenomena of smuggling,&#13;
rent-seeking, and black markets which have been so far analyzed separately in&#13;
the literature. By relating the official exchange rate, the black market&#13;
rate, and the import premium through the: activities of smuggling and rent-&#13;
seeking, the model helps to understand the way in which exchange controls&#13;
affect the behavior of the different agents in the economy, leading to the&#13;
creation of a parallel market economy.&#13;

The remainder of this introductory section serves as a reader's&#13;
guide by presenting the outline of the paper and reviewing its major findings&#13;
with an indication where these are located in subsequent sections.&#13;
The next section gives an historical perspective of exchange con-&#13;
trols in Sub-Saharan Africa, the region that is emphasized throughout the&#13;
paper. It analyzes the different exchange rate regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
trying to establish their common characteristics as well as their marked&#13;
differences. For countries where the common pattern of response to foreign&#13;
exchange scarcity has been to rely on exchange controls, a detailed summary of&#13;
their exchange control measures is presented in Appendix A.&#13;
Section III presents the theoretical framework to analyze exchange&#13;
controls. The first part describes the range of policy instruments available&#13;
to the authorities for dealing with balance-of-payments problems. Exchange&#13;
control is primarily a balance-of-payments policy and this part relates it to&#13;
all the other policy alternatives. It also presents a brief discussion on the&#13;
possible rationale behind the prevalent use of exchange controls in LDCs,&#13;
particularly in Africa. The second part outlines the ways in which exchange&#13;
controls have been analyzed in the literature and develops a model of exchange&#13;
controls.&#13;
The model developed shows that parallel market activities can be&#13;
explained through the optimizing behavior of exporters and importers.&#13;
Exporters will keep shifting their exports from official to parallel market&#13;
channels until the expected marginal benefit in both activities is the same.&#13;
Import traders will devote resources to the rent-seeking activity until the&#13;
moment in which an additional unit spent in this activity is equal to the&#13;
savings derived from being able to use official channels instead of the&#13;
parallel markets. Their combined behavior determines the amount of import and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
export smugglLng, the level of the rent-seeking activity, and the black market&#13;
exchange rate that is consistent with an equilibrium position where no one has&#13;
any more incentives to move from their attained position.&#13;
In this context, rent-seeking, smuggling, and black markets are&#13;
phenomena tha,t coexist in an economy with exchange controls. Indeed some very&#13;
interesting Interrelationships between these variables are determined in the&#13;
model.&#13;
On one side, the rent-seeking activity seems to be inversely related&#13;
to the official exchange rate, and directly related to the black market rate&#13;
and the level of government policing activity. On the other side, the&#13;
fraction of exports that is channelled through parallel markets is directly&#13;
related to the black market rate, and inversely related to the official&#13;
exchange rate and the level of government policing activity.&#13;
There are nevertheless some relationships that cannot be determined&#13;
a priori by the model. The most important relationship is the one between the&#13;
black market rate and the official exchange rate. For the case of a country&#13;
with severe foreign exchange constraints one can expect this relationship to&#13;
be negative. On the one hand, the productivity of the rent-seeking activity&#13;
is very limited as a result of the overall scarcity of foreign exchange, and&#13;
on the other hand, we can expect that any increase in the government foreign&#13;
exchange earnings will be reverted to the economy by relaxing the exchange&#13;
controls. But as a general conclusion, the way in which a depreciation of the&#13;
official exchange rate affects the black market rate seems to be an empirical&#13;
question that can only be determined for each particular country under its&#13;
specific circumstances.&#13;
Section IV develops a simple methodology to detect the presence and&#13;
assess the magnitude of the parallel market economy, as well as to explain its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
behavior in a quantitative fashion. This methodology is presented through a&#13;
case study for Ghana, a country in Sub-Saharan Africa where parallel market&#13;
activities seem to be widespread and relatively open in the economy. But, in&#13;
principle, the methodology outlined in this section could be applied, by the&#13;
country economist, to each particular country where exchange controls are&#13;
imposed.&#13;
In the first part, a reduced form equation of the black market&#13;
exchange rate that is derived from the context of our model is estimated for&#13;
the case of Ghana. There is a definite negative relationship between the real&#13;
official exchange rate and the black market rate in this case. By letting the&#13;
real official exchange rate appreciate, the government of Ghana has been&#13;
losing an important amount of foreign exchange related to the exports that are&#13;
now being smuggled out of Ghana instead of going through the official&#13;
channels. This has meant an important reduction in the amount of foreign&#13;
exchange allocated to imports and therefore an increase in the demand for&#13;
smuggled imports in the economy. In all, the real appreciation of the&#13;
official exchange rate seems to be very much related to the increasing&#13;
importance of parallel market activities in the economy.&#13;
The estimation results are encouraging and give ample support to the&#13;
key determinants of the black market exchange rate derived from the context of&#13;
our model. They also seem to indicate that the exchange rate policies pursued&#13;
by the government of Ghana have led to the emergence and growing importance of&#13;
the parallel market economy in this country.&#13;
The second part of the section focuses on the estimation of the size&#13;
of the parallel market economy and its evolution in time. We use the general&#13;
methodology developed by Tanzi (1982), with which he estimates the underground&#13;
economy and tax evasion in the United States. In our case, the approach&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
emphasizes the fact that there is a demand for currency related to the&#13;
activities of the parallel market economy. In particular, we postulate that&#13;
the demand for currency in Ghana is directly related to the amount of domestic&#13;
currency that is being traded in the black market.&#13;
In this way, the method of estimating the size of the parallel&#13;
market economy involves a two-stage procesdure. First, the amount of domestic&#13;
currency traded in the black market has to be determined.     This is, of course,&#13;
an unobservabLe variable. We can, therefore, only estimate a proxy variable&#13;
for the amount of domestic currency tradied in the black market which we do by&#13;
estimating the quantity of cocoa smuggled out of Ghana.     Second, we use this&#13;
proxy variable in the estimation of the demand-for-currency equation. This&#13;
gives an estimate of the amount of "illegal money" in the economy, which can&#13;
then be transformed into a GDP estimate of the parallel market economy by&#13;
assuming that the velocity of money is t'he same in the parallel market economy&#13;
as it is in the "official" economy.&#13;
The yearly estimates of the parallel market economy show the&#13;
increasing importance of parallel market activities in the Ghanaian economy.&#13;
From a situation where parallel market activities were nearly non-existent in&#13;
1965, the parallel market economy rose almost steadily to a 32.4 percent of&#13;
official GDP Ln 1982.&#13;
This discouraging picture of t'he Ghanaian economy pushed its&#13;
government to undertake the policy measure it tried to avoid for so many&#13;
years: by April 1984 the official exchange rate had been depreciated to 33&#13;
Cedis per U.S. Dollar, from the original 2.75 Cedis per U.S. Dollar, after&#13;
having followted a transitional arrangement of a multiple exchange rate system&#13;
introduced in April 1983.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
The historical lesson that Ghana embodies should be clear, its&#13;
policy implications understood: Governments that impose exchange controls&#13;
based on a hostile attitude toward exchange-rate changes, thinking that they&#13;
are gaining control of the economy by having a "direct" allocative mechanism&#13;
for foreign exchange, as distinct from an amorphous and unpredictable price&#13;
mechanism, may find themselves losers in their own battle. With higher&#13;
domestic inflation rates than world inflation rates these governments are&#13;
progressively losing control of the economy as more and more transactions are&#13;
diverted to the parallel markets. Furthermore, this loss of official control&#13;
over the economy comes with an additional cost given by the inefficiencies&#13;
related to the discriminatory process in which import licenses are assigned,&#13;
as well as the increasing amount of resources that the economy loses in the&#13;
rent-seeking activity.&#13;
Finally, Section V elaborates on some of the policy implications of&#13;
our analysis. It shows that the existence of a parallel market economy has a&#13;
significant effect on the repercussions that follow exchange controls. For&#13;
example, the imposition of exchange controls as a substitute for a formal&#13;
devaluation does not avoid the adverse repercussions on prices or real wages&#13;
of a devaluation. The emergence of a parallel market economy in response to&#13;
such controls and the depreciation of the black market exchange rate have&#13;
similar consequences to those of an official devaluation. Thus, the overall&#13;
results of this paper indicate that the use of a more integrated framework to&#13;
analyze exchange controls has important policy implications. Hopefully the&#13;
paper will inspire further work along these lines.&#13;

II. A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS&#13;
IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA&#13;
During the last few years there has been a growing recognition that&#13;
part of the roots of economic stagnation in Sub-Saharan Africa lie on domestic&#13;
policy deficiencies. Although the external environment has been an aggra-&#13;
vating factor, the record of poor growth in most Sub-Saharan African countries&#13;
suggests that policymakers have given ina,lequate attention to increase the&#13;
efficiency of resource allocation. This was the conclusion of the Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa report (1981) and is now being conEirmed by the analysis done for the&#13;
new Sub-Saharan report (1984).&#13;
A generalized impression is that trade and exchange-rate policy is&#13;
at the heart of the failure to correct deep distortions in relative prices in&#13;
these economies. To analyze this further we can, as a first approximation,&#13;
divide Sub-Saharan Africa into three analytical groups of countries 5/, as&#13;
shown in Table 1.&#13;
5/ This division is made on the basis of traditional balance-of-payments&#13;
analysis that asserts:&#13;
there are essentially three means by which a country's external&#13;
accounts may be kept in balance: monetary and fiscal policies&#13;
under fixed exchange rates responding to the imperatives of the&#13;
balance-of-payments; flexible exchange rates; and exchange&#13;
control, under which quantitative restrictions on international&#13;
transactions are adjusted to restrict payments to foreigners to a&#13;
level commensurate with foreign exchange availability from&#13;
earnings and borrowing (Krueger, 1983, p. 173).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
As expected, no country in Sub-Saharan Africa follows a flexible&#13;
exchange rate policy. In 1983 there were three countries: Nigeria, Sierra&#13;
Leone, and Uganda that followed a managed floating system. The rest of the&#13;
countries determined their exchange rates on the basis of a peg to a given&#13;
currency or a composite of currencies, including the SDR.&#13;
In the first group of countries, which is the largest one, the&#13;
common pattern of response to foreign exchange scarcity has been to rely on&#13;
exchange controls. 6/    Governments have imposed import restrictions rather&#13;
than resorting to devaluation or restrictLve monetary and fiscal policies&#13;
to conserve foreign exchange. The second group of countries have basically&#13;
no restrictions on payments for current transactions and therefore rely on&#13;
exchange rate adjustments and corresponding fiscal and monetary polices for&#13;
balance-of-payments adjustments. Finally, the third group is represented&#13;
by the CFA Franc Area. In this case the members of the two monetary&#13;
unions, the Central African Currency Union and the West African Currency&#13;
Union, signed an agreement of monetary cooperation with France whereby the&#13;
exchange rate between the French franc and the franc of African Financial&#13;
Cooperation (CFA) was fixed, foreign exchange reserves were pooled,&#13;
exchange controls were common to the whole zone, and an "operation account"&#13;
at the French Treasury guaranteed the convertibility of the CFA franc.&#13;
R. Mundell explains the outcome of this arrangement concisely:&#13;
Balance of payments equilibrium is maintained by rigid financial&#13;
discipline of the member countries, the governments of which are&#13;
prevented from using the Central Bank as a source of inflationary&#13;
finance. Government accounts must be balanced except insofar as&#13;
6/   In general, when we talk about exchange controls in this paper, we&#13;
focus on the related restrictions on payments for current tran-&#13;
sactions. Most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have restrictions on&#13;
payments for capital transactions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
the government has cash reserves at its disposal or can acquire extra&#13;
credits from one of the common banks or from abroad. 7/&#13;
This does not mean that these countries have not employed quanti-&#13;
tative restrictions, but rather that any such restriction has been imposed for&#13;
motives other than balance-of-payments constraints, and have been relatively&#13;
invariant with respect to the availability of foreign exchange.&#13;
The marked differences in the exchange rate regimes followed by the&#13;
countries in the analytical groups can be appreciated by observing the&#13;
behavior of their nominal and real effective exchange rates. 8/ This is&#13;
presented in Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2. 9/&#13;
7/  R. Mundell (1972), p. 33.&#13;
The nominal effective exchange rate is here defined as the import-weighted&#13;
geometric average of the relevant individual bilateral exchange rates.&#13;
The actual formula is given by:&#13;
Eio&#13;
where Eit represents the price of domestic currency in terms of the&#13;
ith partner country at time t (Eio is for the base period), and wi is&#13;
the import weight for the ith trading partner.&#13;
The real effective exchange rate is an import-weighted geometric&#13;
average of the bilateral exchange rates adjusted by the ratio of&#13;
domestic consumer price index to the corresponding trade partner&#13;
consumer price index. They are calculated according to the formula:&#13;
E   Pt w&#13;
REER - i (g    t   I)&#13;
io it&#13;
where Pit represents the price level of the ith country at time t&#13;
relative to the base period, and Pt represents the price level of&#13;
the home country, also relative to the base period. For a good review&#13;
study of the major conceptual and methodological problems involved in&#13;
the use of real effective exchange rate indices see Maciejewski&#13;
(1983).&#13;
.-I The indices were only computed for countries in which data were readily&#13;
available. Central African Republic, Chad, Benin, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,&#13;
Mali, Uganda, Seychelles, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, and Swaziland were&#13;

The GNP weighted average of real effective exchange rates in Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa appreciated by 54 percent 10/ between 1972 and 1982. But&#13;
the difference between analytical groups is enormous, and can be seen&#13;
clearly in Figures 1 and 2.&#13;
At one extreme, most CFA countries experienced relatively stable&#13;
nominal and real effective exchange rates over the period. On average, the&#13;
rates of these countries appreciated in real effective terms by only 11&#13;
percent from 1972 to 1982.&#13;
By contrast, real effective exchange rates in Group I appreciated&#13;
by 77 percent over the same period, even after having a 31 percent&#13;
depreciation of their average nominal eff'ective exchange rates. These&#13;
figures are heavily influenced by the experience of some of the countries&#13;
in the group where the need to offset relatively high domestic inflation&#13;
rates by exchange rate changes is precludled by the existence or imposition&#13;
of exchange controls.&#13;
This result tends to confirm the general expectation that&#13;
"relatively appreciating" countries must eventually intensify import&#13;
restrictions to maintain overvalued exchange rates and avoid running out of&#13;
reserves.&#13;
The characteristics of these analytical groups reflect the marked&#13;
differences irn historical experience between Francophone and Anglophone&#13;
countries. As Mundell (1972) puts it, it: is not surprising that the&#13;
differences in cultural patterns arising from the different methods and&#13;

text were computed disregarding Ghana, which is a very extreme case.&#13;

techniques of colonization reveal themselves in the currency and banking&#13;
systems inherited by the African countries, on the approaches to economic&#13;
policy, and the settings within which policies are carried out. Overall&#13;
Better monetary policy has been the beneficiary in the French&#13;
countries; greater monetary experience in the English. Some&#13;
of the former British colonies gained financial experience&#13;
and institutional development in the process, but the&#13;
experience has not been acquired without cost and as a&#13;
consequence more rigid systems of exchange control, with its&#13;
consequenMe   for illict trading and distortions, have been&#13;
imposed.&#13;
It is the purpose of this paper to analyze some of these&#13;
consequences of exchange controls for the countries that have relied on&#13;
them. -L    In particular, the paper will focus on the way in which exchange&#13;
controls affect the behavior of the different agents in the economy,&#13;
leading to the creation of a parallel market economy.&#13;

III. EXCHANGE CONTROLS: THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
A. Exchange Controls as a Balance of Payments Policy&#13;
Exchange control is primarily a balance of payments policy, but&#13;
it is just a particular option within a wide range of balance-of-payments&#13;
policy instruments available to achieve external balance. We will now make&#13;
a quick review of these policy alternatives. We will do so by analyzing&#13;
their impact on the foreign exchange market, depicted in Figure 3.&#13;
As we know, the exchange market is a conceptual device that&#13;
allows us conveniently to summarize the forces determining equilibrium in&#13;
exchange between countries. Lurking behind the demand and supply curves of&#13;
Figure 3 are people's desires to hold curcencies as financial assets as&#13;
well as to use them as means of payment. We must remember that the demand&#13;
and supply for foreign exchange shift wit'h any of innumerable real and&#13;
monetary economic conditions.&#13;
To begin with, let us assume that the exchange rate is overvalued&#13;
at eo, and, therefore, we have an excess of ex-ante payments over&#13;
receipts. The theory of international economics has shown that there are&#13;
essentially two automatic adjustment mechanisms to an imbalance of&#13;
international transactions. If the exchange rate is flexible, the price of&#13;
foreign exchange will immediately be bid up and domestic money will&#13;
depreciate. The gap between autonomous demand and supply of exchange will&#13;
be closed by movements along the existing schedules to the equilibrium&#13;
exchange rate, e*. Alternatively, if the exchange rate is pegged, the&#13;
deficit will gradually reduce the net foreign liquidity of the country.&#13;

The balance of payments affects the money stock over time and, as a result,&#13;
the cash balances fall as does the level of spending, eventually&#13;
contracting autonomous demand for foreign exchange and expanding the&#13;
supply.  The gap between the two schedules will be closed as both of them&#13;
shift until they intersect at the prevailing parity.&#13;
We now turn to consider the range of balance of payments adjust-&#13;
ment policies, and the specific ways in which the government can intervene&#13;
in the adjustment process. Essentially, the authorities have two alterna-&#13;
tives. They can either reinforce the automatic adjustment process, or they&#13;
can resist it. 13/&#13;
If the government chooses to, cr is forced to by the unsustain-&#13;
able low level of reserves, reinforce the! market response, it can either&#13;
(1) keep the exchange rate pegged and encourage the necessary price and&#13;
income changes by means of deflationary mionetary and fiscal policies, or&#13;
(2) depreciate the exchange rate. These are the classical adjustment&#13;
methods. A possible combination of these instruments may be necessary in&#13;
order to achieve internal as well as external balance. For example, in the&#13;
case of a balance of payments deficit accompanied by unemployment, the&#13;
authorities could try to reduce expenditures to close the gap between&#13;
income and expenditure, while at the same time switch domestic and foreign&#13;
expenditures from foreign output to domestic output to prevent the drop in&#13;
output caused by the reduction in expenditure. In this context, we can&#13;
characterize the alternative policies outlined before as expenditure&#13;
reducing and expenditure switching policies, respectively.&#13;
13/     This idea is taken from B. J. Cohen (1969) and the reader is&#13;
referred to this book for a more detailed presentation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
On the other hand, if the government decides to resist the market&#13;
adjustment, it can either (3) impose trade restrictions through tariffs or&#13;
quotas, and/or give incentives to exports through export subsidies, or     (4)&#13;
suspend convertibility and resort to exchange controls, rationing foreign&#13;
exchange. The first alternative brings equilibrium in the foreign exchange&#13;
market 14/    by shifting both curves until they intersect at the given&#13;
parity. The second alternative simply supresses excess demand by rationing.&#13;
In Figure 3, this alternative means that the foreign exchange earned at the&#13;
5&#13;
overvalued exchange rate,    QO , is rationed.  If a foreign exchange auction&#13;
were held, licenses to buy foreign exchange would sell domestically at&#13;
ec .   There is an implicit subsidy for international payments of     e e*,&#13;
and an implicit tax for international receipts of     e*e0 .&#13;
Any of the four alternative balance of payments policies ultimately&#13;
achieves external balance by forcing a reallocation of resources that leads to&#13;
the necessary changes in the volume of exports, imports, and capital move-&#13;
ments. The questions that then seem to arise are: Is the new allocation of&#13;
resources efficient? What is the income distribution related to each outcome?&#13;
It should be clear that the use of any of the four policy alter-&#13;
natives or any combination will produce a different income distribution&#13;
pattern. For the time being we will not pursue this scope of analysis. Our&#13;
main concern is allocative efficiency.&#13;
14/     Up until now, we have been speaking in loose terms, without&#13;
bringing up any of the conditions by which a certain instrument&#13;
will actually lead to a balance of payments improvement. This is&#13;
granted by the context in which we are talking about the different&#13;
policy instruments. But the reader should keep in mind that we can&#13;
relate each instrument to the conditions by which it can improve&#13;
the balance of payments, and, similarly, output.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

While there are conditions under which tariffs or export subsidies&#13;
are a first-best policy, 15/ or given a constraint to resort to frequent&#13;
parity changes may be considered as useful second-best instruments,&#13;
quantitative r,estrictions and exchange controls are always considered&#13;
inefficient instruments. As Bhagwati puts it:&#13;
This is not to assert that, in principle, one cannot&#13;
combine direct allocations (as in the operation of a&#13;
QR regime) with an optimal allocation and utilization&#13;
of resources. Rather the argument relates to the&#13;
operation of the "visible hand" system, as typica ly&#13;
observed in the developing countries examined. 1-&#13;
But if this is a general consensus among economists, why then are&#13;
exchange controls still used by so many countries? As already shown in the&#13;
previous section, for more than half the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
the common pattern of response to foreign exchange scarcity has been to&#13;
rely increasingly on exchange controls.&#13;
As McKinnon (1979) asserts, the answer to this question may lie&#13;
in the realm of politics as much as in economics. Many governments in LDCs&#13;
view their legitimate mandate to be one of extending state control over&#13;
domestic economic activity. But these saime governments are usually too&#13;
weak to seize full control of the economy in the mode of a centrally&#13;
planned economy. 17/&#13;
15/     For an extensive discussion of this issue see J. Bhagwati (1968).&#13;
16/     J. Bhagwati (1978).  By developing countries examined Bhagwati is&#13;
only referring to the ten countries studied by the NBER project.&#13;
17/     R. I. McKinnon (1979), pp. 437-438.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
Without such a strong planning apparatus for&#13;
allocating resources directly, governments in our&#13;
LDCs find that foreign trade is more easily&#13;
controlled than domestic trade because of (i) the&#13;
need of traders to change from foreign to domestic&#13;
money (or vice versa), and (ii) because of the long&#13;
history of raising revenue by tariffs and licensing&#13;
at a limited number of border crossing stations and&#13;
ports that conveniently encompass the economy.&#13;
Hence, by this ideological argument, QR regimes are&#13;
an indirect but second-best method of exercising a 18&#13;
socialist or otherwise interventionalist mandate.&#13;
Within this political context we can see that exchange controls&#13;
can be used to reward the government's political friends, while repressing&#13;
groups who are politically unfriendly. It can be used as a very effective&#13;
political instrument to achieve economic and non-economic goals (i.e.,&#13;
create a government firm that controls all the exports of a particular&#13;
product from the country, create a government monopoly in the production of&#13;
certain products by controlling the access to essential intermediate&#13;
inputs, etc.).&#13;
On the side of economics not much has been said as possible&#13;
rationale for having exchange controls. McKinnon (1979) hypothesizes that&#13;
widespread financial repression can provide some economic rationale for the&#13;
persistent use of QRs in LDCs. His explanation also applies for exchange&#13;
controls and goes as follows:&#13;
In a financially repressed economy, an open capital&#13;
market barely exists and is incapable of channelling&#13;
funds for investment into high priority uses. Even in&#13;
the highly protected import competing sector,&#13;
entrepreneurs find that they cannot effectively bid&#13;
for bank credits. In this context, possession of an&#13;
exclusive license to import some necessary&#13;
intermediate good -- industrial materials or capital&#13;
equipment -- performs an important dual role:&#13;
18/     McKinnon, op. cit., p. 438.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
(a) the holder of a license gets a capital grant in&#13;
the form of a premium that could be applied towards&#13;
investment; and (b) the exclusivity of the license&#13;
allows the holder to bid more easily for funds from&#13;
the repressed financial systema. The license is&#13;
itself a form of collateral indicating that the&#13;
enterprise in question is economically viable._9&#13;
Another economic argument, and a more persuasive one, that can be&#13;
given to explain the persistent use of exchange controls is, essentially,&#13;
that their immediate effects are relatively certain. Governments that do&#13;
not want to resort to exchange rate changes and cannot deplete their&#13;
reserves anymore can, when confronted by an excess demand for foreign&#13;
exchange, by adrainistrative fiat directly restrict certain or all foreign&#13;
expenditures to whatever level is desired at the given exchange rate.&#13;
Thus, in the short-run at least, exchange controls are a more effective&#13;
instrument for maanaging the foreign exchange market than the policy&#13;
alternatives that might be considered. This does not mean that the&#13;
government does not foresee some of the costs of this measure, only that&#13;
the government, after considering the political and economic costs of the&#13;
different adjustLment policies prefers the immediate benefits of exchange&#13;
controls. One cannot blame as irrational a government that undertakes&#13;
exchange control measures instead of a devaluation when the risk of the&#13;
later is its own overthrow. 20/&#13;
19/     McKinnon, op. cit., p. 440.&#13;
20/     For example, the 1971 devaluation in Ghana prompted the overthrow&#13;
of the civilian government through a military coup three weeks&#13;
later, in January 1972 (see Y. Ansu (1984)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
The fact that economists have for so long regarded exchange&#13;
controls as "obviously non-optimal from the resource allocation view-&#13;
point" 31/ has meant a very small amount of effort, in terms of economic&#13;
theory, to explain the behavior of economies where exchange controls are a&#13;
"fact of life". That is why we do not have a unified analytical framework&#13;
to understand the way in which exchange controls affect the behavior of the&#13;
different agents in the economy and to perceive how these economies react&#13;
to different disturbances.&#13;
The next part of this section develops a model of exchange&#13;
controls that takes the first steps in this direction.&#13;
B.      Analysis of Exchange-Control Regimes&#13;
"An exchange control regime is one wherein an ex-ante balance of&#13;
payments deficit is eliminated through foreign exchange rationing". 22/ In&#13;
its most extreme form, the government assumes a complete control of foreign&#13;
exchange. The currency is made totally inconvertible. Local residents are&#13;
required to surrender all foreign-exchange earnings to the authorities. In&#13;
turn, residents wishing to make payments of foreign exchange must obtain it&#13;
from the authorities. Going back to Figure 3, in this case excess demand&#13;
for foreign exchange,    Qd -  Q O    is suppressed and   QO  is rationed&#13;
o      0                         0&#13;
such that   Qd   =Q       To understand the impact of this policy in the&#13;
economy one could translate the foreign exchange rationing scheme into a&#13;

set of quotas for imports and then simply use the analysis of quantitative&#13;
restrictions in the trade-theoretic literature. Under perfect competi.tion&#13;
and given terms of trade the imposition of a quota on an importable good is&#13;
depicted in Figure 4.&#13;

At given international prices          A  is supplied by domestic&#13;
firms and AB    is imported.   If a quota on imports,   CD , is imposed, the&#13;
market will then clear at import-premium inclusive price    pm + p,&#13;
where   OC   is now supplied by domestic firms and the full  CD    quota is&#13;
used. The shadowed rectangle is collected as a rent by the importers who&#13;
gained access to the import licenses. The imposition of the quota allows&#13;
the government to maintain an overvalued exchange rate at    e0 . as in&#13;
Figure 3.  The effective exchange rate for exports would be    e ,  while&#13;
the effective exchange rate on imports (inclusive of the premium) would&#13;
be   e&#13;
c&#13;
As it can be seen, up until this point there is no difference in&#13;
the economic analysis of a direct quantitative restriction on imports, or&#13;
an import restriction through the use of exchange controls. The use of the&#13;
more elaborated administrative procedure of exchange controls can only be&#13;
justified to the point at which governments find that foreign trade is more&#13;
easily and effectively controlled through the foreign exchange market.&#13;
Traders need to change from foreign to domestic money (or vice versa).&#13;
It is using this theoretical framework that most of the analysis&#13;
of exchange controls is conducted in the economic literature, in general,&#13;
and in The World Bank, in particular. We now turn into the area that has&#13;
not been studied as much, and is the main focus of this paper and the&#13;
methodology we develop: parallel market activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
The similarity between the economic analysis of a direct&#13;
quantitative restriction on imports and an import restriction through the&#13;
use of exchange controls falls apart the moment we consider illegal&#13;
transactions. A direct import quota may create incentives to smuggle&#13;
imports as long as the import related premium outweighs the risks ensuing&#13;
from the illegal transactions. If the quota is imposed through exchange&#13;
controls then the foreign exchange needed to smuggle goods into the country&#13;
needs to be purchased through the black market. In this case there is an&#13;
incentive to smuggle imports as long as the import premium outweighs the&#13;
black market premium together with the risks involved in illegal&#13;
transactions. As has been pointed out by the literature, direct import&#13;
quotas can only create incentives for smuggling but do not give incentives&#13;
for the creation of a black market in foreign exchange. 23/&#13;
In the case of exchange controls it is not very meaningful to&#13;
pose the question of import smuggling and its effects on welfare without&#13;
exploring the means of its finance. This possible black market aspect of&#13;
smuggling is not captured by the existing literature on smuggling in&#13;
international traide. The reason is that the analysis of smuggling has&#13;
always been carried out in a framework of trade restrictions (quotas,&#13;
tariffs) and not of exchange controls. But in the former, black markets of&#13;
foreign exchange are never an issue.&#13;
There is another phenomena related to quantitative restrictions&#13;
on trade that has not been related either to smuggling or black markets:&#13;
rent seeking. Anne Krueger (1974) shows how quantitative restrictions,&#13;
23/     M. Sheikh (1976), pp. 9-10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
which carry premiums, attract the use of resources in order to earn them.&#13;
This use of real resources entails a greater loss of welfare than a&#13;
Bhagwati equivalent tariff would. Krueger avoids in her analysis the&#13;
direct relation between the activities of smuggling and rent-seeking.&#13;
With trade restrictions and no exchange controls we can think of&#13;
a "constrained importer" as having two options to acquire its desired&#13;
imports: (i) Use resources to smuggle the good into the country; (ii) use&#13;
resources to get hold of the import license. 24/ An increase in the amount&#13;
of smuggled goods decreases the import premium of a given license and&#13;
therefore diminishes the incentives for rent seeking. To understand rent-&#13;
seeking activities it is important to relate them with smuggling&#13;
activities. Furthermore, the moment we enter into a world of exchange&#13;
controls we have to face the interrelationship between smuggling, rent-&#13;
seeking, and black markets.&#13;
It seems, then, that the theory of international trade has yet to&#13;
develop a single unifying analytical framework to study exchange&#13;
controls. There has been an extensive amount of related work done in the&#13;
literature, but there are still some important loose ends. We now try to&#13;
tie up some of these loose ends by developing a model of exchange&#13;
controls. It brings together, through an analytical framework, the&#13;
phenomena of smuggling, rent-seeking, and black markets which have been so&#13;
far analyzed separately in the literature. By relating the official&#13;
exchange rate, the black market rate, and the import premium through the&#13;
24/     This can involve manpower to carry out all the administrative&#13;
procedures, bribes, increase of installed capacity if this is used&#13;
by the authorities as an indicator to allocate licenses, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
activities of smuggling and rent seeking, the model tries to capture the&#13;
way in which exchange controls affect the behavior of the different agents&#13;
in the economy, leading to the creation of a parallel market economy. It&#13;
gives the necessary analytical elements to understand the behavior of this&#13;
parallel market economy.&#13;
1. The Model&#13;
This model is a variant of a model developed by Yaw Ansu&#13;
(1984). In this model, he analyzes the reLationship of the markets for&#13;
warrants and for illegal trade in foreign currency in a policy-making set&#13;
up. We take his approach of looking at the parallel market activities&#13;
through the opt:Lmizing behavior of exporters and importers. We incorporate&#13;
into the model rent-seeking as an importer"s activity, while we disregard&#13;
the analysis of warrants.&#13;
The stylized facts that the model tries to capture are given by&#13;
the following scenario.&#13;
A govesrnment has imposed exchange controls in its effort to&#13;
protect its reserve positions and to avoid official exchange rate&#13;
adjustments. In the face of balance of payments pressures, the number of&#13;
requests for import licenses (with its respective foreign exchange) far&#13;
exceeds the number of licenses actually given. This has the impact of a&#13;
quantitative restriction on imports. The import related premium gives&#13;
incentives to rent-seeking, and smuggling. But in order to smuggle goods&#13;
into the country, one needs to get the foreign exchange to buy them. This&#13;
can only be done through the black market where the exporters can provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
foreign exchange acquired through illegal exports in return for an&#13;
appropriate reward: the black market premium. The importer has to decide&#13;
how to allocate its resources, either to try and get the import license and&#13;
its related premium, or get the import through smuggling by paying the&#13;
black market premium and running the risks of being involved in illegal&#13;
transactions. On the other hand, the exporter also has to decide whether&#13;
to channel its exports through official markets and get the official&#13;
exchange rate, or through parallel markets and get the black market rate&#13;
while running the risks of illegal transactions. Their behavior will&#13;
determine the amount of import and export smuggling, the level of rent-&#13;
seeking activity, and the black market exchange rate that is consistent&#13;
with an equilibrium position where no one has any more incentives to move&#13;
from their attained positions.&#13;
We now turn to the analysis of the behavior of the different&#13;
agents in the economy. The notation used throughout the model follows, as&#13;
closely as possible, that of Yaw Ansu in order to be able to relate both&#13;
models easily.&#13;
(a) The Importer s Optimization Problem&#13;
We consider that imports are carried out by a "representative"&#13;
trader who has a fixed contract to import an amount    M .   We assume that&#13;
the trader is a price taker in the market where he sells the imports. It&#13;
is also assumed that all imports purchased at the official market rate are&#13;
resold. Hence, while the imported good may be purchased at two different&#13;
exchange rates, the price at which it is sold is uniform, being determined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
by its (marginal) cost on the parallel market.&#13;
The trader then tries to minimize the costs to obtain its&#13;
amount   M  of imports.   There are two ways through which the trader can&#13;
obtain its imports. It can try to get an import license, with its&#13;
respective foreign exchange at the official exchange rate, by spending z&#13;
(in domestic currency). This rent-seeking activity can be thought as: (i)&#13;
increasing the probability of being eligible for an import license under a&#13;
given set of criteria; (ii) influencing the decision on how to allocate a&#13;
given import license. Let q (z) be the share of imports that is actually&#13;
channeled through official markets.&#13;
In principle the correct specification of q is something like&#13;
q(z,  T ) where     T is a government import-restriction parameter.    It can&#13;
be thought as being determined by the level of reserves with respect to a&#13;
desired level, that is    T(R-R ).   If the foreign exchange reserves are&#13;
above the desired level    R , the exchange controls could be relaxed and&#13;
therefore a higher proportion of imports could be channeled through the&#13;
official market. There are two extreme assumptions that could be made in&#13;
regards to this government reaction function. On the one hand we can&#13;
assume that the exchange control is independent of the level of reserves.&#13;
In this case, for any policy change we will have a drop or an increase in&#13;
reserves. On the other hand, the stock of reserves in foreign currency may&#13;
be treated as a target variable. This implies that any parametric shift in&#13;
the supply function for foreign exchange in the official market will be&#13;
accompanied by an intensification or relaxation of controls so as to&#13;
maintain the reserve or balance of payments target. For the time being, to&#13;
maintain the model as simple as possible, we will assume that exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
controls are independent of the level of reserves. Therefore, we let&#13;
q(z) be the share of imports that is actually channeled through official&#13;
markets. This function q(z) captures the inescapable reality in most&#13;
LDCs of people being able to influence, in one way or another, the&#13;
government allocation of import licenses. It relates the rent-seeking&#13;
activity to its achievements.   We assume that    q (z)  &gt;  0,  that is, an&#13;
increase in the rent-seeking activity will allow the importer to channel a&#13;
larger amount of its imports through official markets.&#13;
On the other hand, the "representative" trader can allocate its&#13;
resources through the parallel markets. As Yaw Ansu (1984) points out,&#13;
parallel market activity involves two steps. First, foreign currency has&#13;
to be obtained on the black market, and second, the foreign goods purchased&#13;
with it have to be smuggled 3L   into the country.   If we let   +   be&#13;
the conditional probability of success of this composite illegal transac-&#13;
tion, 26/ the problem faced by the representative importer can be written&#13;
as:&#13;
25/     Our analysis of smuggling can also be readily extended to quasi-&#13;
smuggling phenomena, such as underinvoicing imports in this case.&#13;
26/     For a detailed interpretation of this function see Y. Ansu&#13;
(1984).   p is a decreasing function of    m,  the fraction of&#13;
imports that is channeled through parallel markets, and of     p, the&#13;
level of government policing activity.&#13;

Eb = black market rate&#13;
p = level of government policing activity&#13;
*&#13;
P M = fixed import expenditure, in foreign currency,&#13;
for the "representative" trader.&#13;
The sum of the first and second terms in expression (1) repre-&#13;
sents the total costs, in domestic currency, of importing a fraction q of&#13;
total imports through the official channels. The first term gives the&#13;
costs of these imports at the official exchange rate, while the second one&#13;
gives the costs of the rent-seeking activity. The third term represents&#13;
the expected costs of imports channeled through parallel markets.&#13;
For the maximization exercise we normalize     P mM   to unity.&#13;
After rearranging terms the first order condition would then be:&#13;
Eb             4'(m,p) q (z)     Eb&#13;
(2)      qI(z) [E         e] - _______         m  -E&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
The first term is the expected saving in black market premiums&#13;
from being able to use official channels instead of parallel markets. The&#13;
second term is the reduction in costs of imports being smuggled into the&#13;
country, given by the increase in the probability of success in that&#13;
*'(m,p) q (z)&#13;
activity of         (m, )     percent.&#13;
The sum of both terms gives the total amount of savings that&#13;
comes about from an increase in one unit on the amount spent in the rent&#13;
seeking activity. The trader will devote resources to the rent-seeking&#13;
activity until the moment in which an additional unit spent in this&#13;
activity is equal to the savings derived from being able to use official&#13;
channels instead of parallel markets.&#13;
A nice interpretation that comes out of this first order&#13;
condition is given for the case in which activities in the parallel markets&#13;
are as safe as those in the official markets, that is, when     p   cte = 1.&#13;
The first order condition would then look like:&#13;
(3)      q,(z)(Eb _   e) = 1&#13;
The savings in this case only come from the black market premium.&#13;
The second order condition for an interior minimum is:&#13;

Sufficient conditions for the second derivative to be positive are:&#13;

(ii)     d" (m,p) 4 0     The probability of success in illegal transactions&#13;
is a decreasing function of the amount of smuggling&#13;
at a non-decreasing rate.&#13;
Both conditions are very reasonable assumptions about the behavior&#13;
of q and 0 . We keep these assumptions for the rest of the model.&#13;
We now turn to find the effects of other variables on z in the&#13;
neighborhood of the optimum. The first order condition given by (2) is&#13;
totally differentiated to get:&#13;

illegal transactions is a decreasing function of the amount of smuggling at a&#13;
non-decreasing rate as the level of government policing activity is increased,&#13;
then   d  &gt; 0 .    This is a very intuitive assumption and we keep it for the&#13;
rest of the model.&#13;
We can now write:&#13;
(9)       z = z (e, E , p)&#13;
where      Ze &lt; 0, Z b&gt; 0, and z   &gt; 0&#13;
e     Eb E&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
The rent-seeking activity is inversely related to the official&#13;
exchange rate, and directly related to the black market rate, and the level&#13;
of government policing activity. As it can be seen, this is a very&#13;
intuitive result.&#13;
(b) The Exporter's Optimization Problem&#13;
The set up of the exporter's optimization problem is taken&#13;
directly from Yaw Ansu (1984), the only difference being that we do not&#13;
consider the warrant scheme. This set up is only commented briefly here&#13;
and the reader is referred to Yaw Ansu (1984) for a detailed presentation.&#13;
To focus on how smuggling behavior is related to the black market&#13;
we will assume that the total volume of exports of the "representative"&#13;
exporter is fixed    P X .   The problem faced by this exporter is to decide&#13;
what fraction of its exports to channel through the official market, and&#13;
what fraction through the parallel markets. We should refer as s to the&#13;
fraction of exports channeled through parallel markets. Again, activity&#13;
through paralleL markets involves two steps. First, the exporter has to&#13;
smuggle its product out of the country to sell it abroad, and second, the&#13;
foreign exchange that it gets from its illegal export has to be changed to&#13;
domestic currency through the black market.   Having    0  as the probability&#13;
of success of this composite activity, we can state the "representative"&#13;
exporter maximization problem as:&#13;
(10)      MAX A = e(l-s) P X + e(s,p)s E P X&#13;
s              x                X&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
The first term of this expression represents the amount of&#13;
domestic currency that is obtained by exports through the official channel,&#13;
and the second term is the expected value, in domestic currency, of the&#13;
exports through parallel markets.&#13;
For the maximization exercise we normalize    P X   to unity.&#13;
After rearranging terms, the first order condition would then be:&#13;
(11)      e = [O(s,p) + s e (s,p)] Eb&#13;
5&#13;
The exporter will keep shifting its exports from official to&#13;
parallel channels until the expected marginal benefits in both activities&#13;
are the same. In the particular case in which illegal transactions are as&#13;
safe as legal ones, that is, when    0 = cte = 1,    we have:&#13;
(12)      dA     E b&#13;
d-s &#13;
If the black market rate is higher than the official exchange rate, the&#13;
exporter will send all of his exports through parallel markets.&#13;
The second order condition for an interior optimum is:&#13;
d2A                               b&#13;
(13)              [2 O  (s,p) + s" (s,p)] E   &lt; 0&#13;
ds&#13;
A sufficient condition for the second derivative to be negative&#13;
is   0" &lt; 0 ,   which is the assumption made about the behavior of&#13;
.&#13;
We keep this assumption also for    0&#13;
m                                          s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
We now turn to find the effect o.E other variables on s in the&#13;
neighborhood of the optimum.     The first order condition given by       (11) is&#13;
totally differentiated to get:&#13;
dA 2                                  b       e    b&#13;
(14)       - de + (-) ds + [0'(s,p) + s 0"; (s,p)] E dp +        -   dE     0&#13;
ds                                            Eb&#13;
From this equation we can see that:&#13;
ds     2A -l&#13;
(15)      ds      d        &lt; 0&#13;
ds&#13;
e&#13;
ds     _Eb    _     d 2A  Eb -1&#13;
(16)                 2 =    E  (d2A     )  &gt; 0&#13;
dE        d A       ds    e&#13;
ds2&#13;
ds      [6'(s,p) + s O' (s,p)J Eb&#13;
(17)      ds                   2SP&#13;
dp        p          2A&#13;
ds2&#13;
Assuming 0"    4  0,      which is the same behavioral assumption&#13;
SP&#13;
for    *" .   we have that ds&lt; O&#13;
We can now write:&#13;
(18)       s = s(ea, Eb   p)&#13;
where   s&lt;     0  s   &gt;0, and s      &lt;0&#13;
e         E b           p&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
The fraction of exports that is channeled through parallel&#13;
markets is directly related to the black market rate, and inversely related&#13;
to the official exchange rate, and the level of government policing&#13;
activity. Again, a very intuitive result.&#13;
(c) Black Market for Foreign Exchange&#13;
We can now use the results of the previous sub-sections,&#13;
summarized by equations (9) and (18), to understand the behavior of the&#13;
black market for foreign exchange.&#13;
The black market for foreign exchange can be presented as:&#13;
d   (1 - q(z(e,E ,p)))    P M&#13;
(19)      Q                 b          m&#13;
j(l-q(z(e,E ,p)),p)&#13;
(20)      Q=     (s(e,E ,p),p) s(e,E ,p) P XX&#13;
s    d&#13;
which solving for      Q     Q    gives the market clearing condition:&#13;
b                       b__b&#13;
(21)          (l-q(z(e,E ,p)))     *M =   (s(e,Eb ,p),p)s(e,Eb ,p   X&#13;
+(I-q(z(e,E ,p)),P)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
To do some comparative statics Let us first derive the slope of&#13;
the demand and supply equations in (19) and (20).&#13;
m    q' z     P M      q'z'    P M&#13;

(22)                              + (m,p)&#13;
It is clear that       Qb &lt;0     .    Demand for foreign currency in&#13;
dE b&#13;
the black market is inversely related to t:he black market rate.&#13;
For the supply side,&#13;

E b   x&#13;
where&#13;
(24)        0 Q     + s i     1&#13;
The expression in (24) is the new probability of success of&#13;
illegal transactions given the change in the fraction of total exports that&#13;
goes through those channels.&#13;
From (23) and (24) we can see that         -   &gt; 0 .     Supply of&#13;
dEb&#13;
foreign currency in the black market is directly related to the black&#13;
market rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
2. Comparative Statics&#13;
Here we shall draw on the model of black markets to study how&#13;
various disturbances affect the black market rate, the smuggling activity,&#13;
and the intensity of rent-seeking. In particular, we will consider a&#13;
depreciation of the official exchange rate, an increase in the level of&#13;
government policing activity, an increase in imports, and an increase in&#13;
exports.&#13;
(a) Depreciation of the Official Exchange Rate&#13;
Consider the scenario in which the government has decided to&#13;
depreciate the official rate without abolishing exchange controls.&#13;
Differentiating the market-clearing condition (21) we get:&#13;
(6 + s0)s' P*       m * qz    - z qe z  PM&#13;
db           sex2                          ]m&#13;

2               m          s   Eb   x&#13;
Looking at the sign of each expression in (25) it is clear that&#13;
dE b&#13;
de; 0.         We can also prove that equation (25) implies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
°   4  dEb e       . 271    This means that a depreciation of the official&#13;
E&#13;
exchange rate will lead to a less than proportional depreciation of the&#13;
black market rate. In other words, after all the adjustment takes place,&#13;
E})&#13;
the new equilibrium black market premium, -- ,         will fall.&#13;
27/ Going back to equations (6) and (7) we see that:&#13;
m f(m,p) - f(m,p)&#13;
Z- b =ze-         2&#13;
E               f (m,p)&#13;
Using equations (15) and (16) we have that:&#13;
Eb      1e -&#13;
Substituting these expressions into (2.5) we get:&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
This can be interpreted by using Figure 5. On the demand side,&#13;
the depreciation of the official exchange rate makes rent-seeking a less&#13;
attractive activity by increasing the marginal costs of using official&#13;
channels to import. This means that less resources are going to be spent&#13;
in rent-seeking activities and a greater fraction of total imports will now&#13;
be channeled through parallel markets. This increases the demand for&#13;
foreign exchange in the black market in two ways. First, to finance the&#13;
increase in the share of imports that is obtained through smuggling, given&#13;
- qze *i&#13;
by          P M .     Second, to finance the increase in the amount of&#13;

goods that now have to be smuggled because of the decrease in the&#13;
probability of success in illegal transactions, given by&#13;
/ q      -Z--&#13;
m    _____) PM      .   The demand curve then shifts to the right.   On&#13;
m&#13;
the supply side, the depreciation makes the official channels more&#13;
attractive for exports, which means that the foreign exchange supplied in&#13;
the black market will drop. The supply curve shifts to the left. Deriving&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
the corresponding    dQ   in the black market    28/   we can see that it is non-&#13;
de&#13;
positive, which is precisely what Figure 5 shows.&#13;
28/ From the supply equation (20) we get:&#13;
dQ =    (~         *                   * IdE b&#13;
dQ = [(O+se       P X] + [(O+se0)s    PX]    -&#13;

Summing up, the depreciation of the official exchange rate leads to&#13;
a less than proportional depreciation of the black market rate. This follows&#13;
from the increase in the use of black markets by import smugglers and domestic&#13;
tourists (increase in   m ), and the decrease in its use by export smugglers&#13;
and foreign tourists (decrease in   s).  The level of the rent-seeking activity&#13;
falls given the decrease in its incentives. And there is a definite reduction&#13;
in the amount of foreign exchange traded in the black market.&#13;
Because of its partial equilibrium nature, the above analysis&#13;
disregards the traditional effect of a depreciation of the official exchange&#13;
rate of increasing the amount of exports and reducing the amount of imports by&#13;
reducing the relative cost of domestic traded goods. The same qualitative&#13;
results may still hold if these effects, which would shift S to the right&#13;
and D to the left, do not overcome the impact of those analyzed previously.&#13;
The case we just presented is based on the initial assumption of the&#13;
model that exchange controls are independent of the level of reserves. If we&#13;
now relax this assumption by considering the case in which the government has&#13;
set a target for the stock of reserves, the results can change significantly.&#13;
The depreciation in the official exchange rate increases the supply&#13;
of foreign exchange to the official market. This follows from the resulting&#13;
increase in the share of exports that is channeled through the official&#13;
markets, (l-s), as shown above. For the case in which exchange controls are&#13;
independent of the level of reserves, this means that the previous results&#13;
would be accompanied by an increase in reserves. But for the case in which&#13;
the government has a target for the level of reserves, the increase in the&#13;
supply of foreign exchange in the official market will be accompanied by a&#13;
relaxation of exchange controls so as to maintain the reserve target. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
means that more import licenses can be granted from the increase in reserves&#13;
which in turn may imply a fall in the demand for imports through smuggling&#13;
despite the drop in the level of the rent-seeking activity analyzed in the&#13;
previous case. These movements in the supply and demand curves of the black&#13;
market are shown in Figure 6 by the shifts of S to S' and D to D'&#13;
respectively. If in addition, we now consider the more traditional effect of&#13;
a depreciation of the official exchange rate of increasing the amount of&#13;
exports and reducing the amount of imports, we may have the situation depicted&#13;
in Figure 6 by the shifts of   S' to S"   and  D' to D".  At   E     the&#13;
depreciation of the official exchange rate gives rise to an excess supply of&#13;
foreign exchange in the black market. This then leads to an appreciation of&#13;
the black market exchange rate.&#13;

-51-&#13;
In this particular case then, the depreciation of the official rate&#13;
leads to an appreciation of the black market rate. Again, the amount of&#13;
foreign exchange traded in the black market: drops. By depreciating the&#13;
official exchange rate the government can generally decrease the level of&#13;
activity in the black market.&#13;
This last case seems to be closer to the reality of a country with&#13;
severe foreign exchange constraints. On one hand, the productivity of the&#13;
rent-seeking activity in this context is very limited because of the overall&#13;
scarcity of foreign exchange. On the other, an increase in the government's&#13;
foreign exchange earnings will generally be reverted to the economy by&#13;
relaxing the exchange controls.&#13;
The waiy in which a depreciation of the exchange rate affects the&#13;
black market rate seems then to be an empirical question that can only be&#13;
determined for each partLcular country under specific circumstances. This&#13;
indeterminacy in the relationship between the movements in the official&#13;
exchange rate and those of the black market rate explains the existent&#13;
controversy on the direction of this relatLonship in the literature. Gupta&#13;
(1981) and Sheilch (1976) find that this relationship is negative. Blejer&#13;
(1978) argues that it is positive. The results just derived show that they&#13;
may both be correct. A key assumption seems to lie on the way in which the&#13;
government handLes its reserves.&#13;
(b) Encrease in the Level of Government Policing Activity&#13;
Let us assume that the government has decided to increase the&#13;
resources spent to prevent illegal transactions in the economy. To understand&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
its impact on the black market, we differentiate the market-clearing&#13;
condition (21):&#13;

4)                           E&#13;
dEb&#13;
The sign of   -      is indeterminate.   The denominator is negative&#13;
dp&#13;
but the numerator is indeterminate. The first term in brackets in the&#13;
numerator is      dQ d     while the second one is given by     dQs    The shift&#13;
dp                                            dp&#13;
of the supply curve is defined. The increase in patrolling activity makes&#13;
export smuggling less attractive and therefore reduces the amount of foreign&#13;
exchange supplied to the black market. On the demand side, however, we have&#13;
two forces working in opposite directions. On one side, the increase in&#13;
patrolling activity makes rent-seeking a more profitable activity to avoid&#13;
illegal channels for imports. This means that more resources are spent to get&#13;
import licenses and more imports can be channeled through official markets.&#13;
On the other side, having more patrols along the border means that the&#13;
probability of success of import smuggling is lower and, therefore, that more&#13;
goods have to be smuggled so that after considering the losses in the activity&#13;
29/ we can get the amount of imports we are interested in.&#13;
Assuming that the effect of the rent-seeking activity dominates, the&#13;
demand curve shifts to the left. This case is represented in Figure 7 where&#13;
both curves shift to the left as a result of the increase in the level of&#13;
29/ These losses can be thought as the goods that have to be disposed of&#13;
by the smugglers to avoid being captured, or as the goods surrendered&#13;
to the authorities in the event of being captured.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
policing activity. We have a decrease in the amount of foreign exchange&#13;
traded in the black market. The new black market rate can either be above or&#13;
below the old one. It depends on the reLative magnitude of the shifts.&#13;

If on the other hand, we assume that the smuggling effect&#13;
dominates the shift of the demand curve, then the increase in patrolling&#13;
activity will lead to an increase in the black market exchange rate. The&#13;
impact on the amount of foreign exchange traded in the black market will be&#13;
undetermined in this case. This is depicted in Figure 8.&#13;

We can think that this is the relevant scenario for a country with&#13;
severe foreign exchange constraints where the productivity of the rent-seeking&#13;
activity is very limited because of the overall scarcity of foreign exchange&#13;
30/.   In this case, the increase in the Jevel of government policing activity&#13;
will be associated with a risk premium in the black market exchange rate given&#13;
by the corresponding change in the rate.&#13;
It seems then that, as in the case of the depreciation of the&#13;
official exchange rate, the way in which an increase in the level of&#13;
government policing activity affects the black market rate can only be&#13;
determined empirically.&#13;
(c) Exogenous Increase in Exports&#13;
Let us consider the case in which a sudden increase in income of a&#13;
foreign country that buys our exports, leads to an increase in their demand&#13;
for our products. Differentiating the market-clearing condition (21):&#13;

30/ For this case, switching to the assumption that the government has a&#13;
target for the level of reserves does not give any definite results.&#13;
This is because the movement of the share of exports that is channeled&#13;
through the official market, l-s, is indeterminate. On the one hand,&#13;
we have an increase in the government policing activity which tends to&#13;
increase this share of exports. But on the other, we have an increase&#13;
in the black market rate which induces a decrease in the share of&#13;
exports channeled through the officiaL market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
It is clear that    d   &lt; 0 .    This is shown in Figure 9 where&#13;
the increase in exports shifts the supply curve to the right. The black&#13;
market rate drops and the amount of foreign exchange traded in the black&#13;
market increases. The drop in the black market premium leads to a decrease&#13;
in the fraction of total exports going through parallel markets (decrease&#13;
in s), as well as an increase in the share of illegal imports in the&#13;
economy (increase in m). The drop in the premium also explains the&#13;
decrease in the level of the rent-seeking activity.&#13;

Let us now consider the case in which the government has set a&#13;
target for the stock of reserves. In this scenario, the increase in total&#13;
exports will expand the supply of foreign exchange in the official market&#13;
both, by the part of the increase in exports that goes through the official&#13;
channels, and by the increase in the share of total exports that is now&#13;
channelled through the official market, 1 - s. This would then mean a&#13;
more relaxed system of exchange controls as more licenses can be granted&#13;
with the increase in reserves. This implies a drop in the demand for&#13;
illegal imports and therefore of foreign exchange in the black market.&#13;
This case is depicted in Figure 10.&#13;

The relaxation of the import control system accentuates the drop in&#13;
the black market exchange rate observed in the previous case, while it&#13;
reverses the effect on the amount of foreign exchange traded in the black&#13;
market.&#13;
Overall, the model predicts a definite negative relationship between&#13;
the total amount of exports in the economy and the black market exchange rate.&#13;
(d) Exogenous Decrease in Imports&#13;
The last disturbance we consider is a shift in demand from imports&#13;
to domestic goods. Differentiating the market clearing condition (21):&#13;
dEb                           m&#13;
(28)      dM    =   mnqz      -q'b&#13;

db&#13;
In this case    d    &gt;0       The decrease in imports is shown in&#13;
dM&#13;
Figure 11 by the shift of the demand curve to     Di   . The black market rate&#13;
drops and the amount of foreign exchange traded in the black market&#13;
decreases. The drop in the black market premium has the same consequences as&#13;
in the previous exercise, a decrease in the fraction of total exports going&#13;
through illegal channels (decrease in s), an increase in the share of illegal&#13;
imports in the economy (increase in m), and a drop in the level of rent-&#13;
seeking activity.&#13;
By switching to the assumption that the government has a target for&#13;
the level of its reserves we only accentuate the drop in the demand curve we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-&#13;
just analyzed. The fall in the black market rate leads to an increase in the&#13;
share of exports that is channeled through the official market, 1 - s. This&#13;
means that the government can now relax its exchange controls and allocate an&#13;
increasing number of import licenses. This will decrease the demand for&#13;
smuggled imports and therefore of foreign exchange in the black market. This&#13;
only accentuates the previous movements of the different variables. This is&#13;
shown in Figure 11 by the shift in the demand curve to    Di .&#13;
The model predicts a definite positive relationship between total&#13;
imports in the economy and the black market exchange rate.&#13;

IV. EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND THE PARALLEL MARKET ECONOMY:&#13;
THE CASE OF GHANA&#13;
The model developed in the previous section provides a theore-&#13;
tical framework to understand the behavior of the parallel market economies&#13;
that have emerged, under the presence of exchange controls, in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa. It does so by analyzing the relationship between the phenomena of&#13;
smuggling, rent-seeking, and black markets.&#13;
The analysis clearly implies that country economists should be&#13;
aware of these illicit phenomena, not only because they vitiate the&#13;
accuracy and possible use of official statistics, but because they could&#13;
affect the type of policy prescriptions given to the governments. They&#13;
should, therefore, be incorporated into the policy analysis conducted in&#13;
the region.&#13;
But to do so, country economists need more than a framework to&#13;
think about the different and interrelated phenomena that constitute the&#13;
parallel market economy. They need quantitative information on the&#13;
behavior of this parallel market economy in specific contexts, as well as a&#13;
way to detect the presence, and assess the magnitude of such phenomenon.&#13;
This section presents a simple methodology that will enable the country&#13;
economist to obtain this type of information.&#13;
The empirical work done in this section refers only to the case&#13;
of Ghana. This country was chosen for the case study for a very simple&#13;
reason. It is a country where parallel market activities seem to be&#13;
widespread and relatively open in the economy. Although considered&#13;
illegal, they are conspicously public and, it would appear, officially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-&#13;
tolerated. This gives us the possibility to compare our estimates with&#13;
available educat:ed guesses, and allow our results to be criticized by&#13;
economists acquainted with this economy. This would test, in some way, the&#13;
results of our methodology. Such results could otherwise be very difficult&#13;
to evaluate.&#13;
The lack of data on parallel market activities in the economy&#13;
precludes the estimation of the underlying structural model outlined in the&#13;
previous section. But, unlike smuggling ar rent-seeking activities, data&#13;
on black market rates are readily available. In Ghana, the ruling rates&#13;
for any particular day are common knowledge. Thus, the black market rate&#13;
data can be used with confidence.&#13;
This enables us to estimate, in the first part of this section, a&#13;
reduced form equation of the black market exchange rate. This serves two&#13;
main purposes. First, it determines empirically, for the case of Ghana,&#13;
the way in which the real official exchange rate and the government&#13;
policing activity are related to the black market rate. These relation-&#13;
ships proved to be theoretically ambiguous and have very important policy&#13;
implications. Of course, it also quantifies the rest of the relationships&#13;
which were, at 'Least theoretically, unambiguous. Second, it gives a first&#13;
notion of the appropriateness of the mode]. to explain the parallel market&#13;
economy through the behavior of the black market for foreign exchange. The&#13;
empirical evidence provides ample support for the role of the key&#13;
determinants of the black market exchange rate outlined by our model.&#13;
In the second part of this section we try to measure the size of&#13;
the parallel market economy in Ghana. Of course, it is not possible to&#13;
measure it directly, but the traces it leaves in other spheres of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62-&#13;
economy can be analyzed and to some extent measured. To do so, we use Vito&#13;
Tanzi's (1982) approach to the estimation of the underground economy in the&#13;
United States. By relating the demand for currency as a fraction of total&#13;
money supply to the activity in the parallel markets, we can estimate the&#13;
amount of "illegal money" in the economy. This estimate is then trans-&#13;
formed into a GDP estimate of the parallel market economy by assuming that&#13;
the velocity of money is the same in the parallel market economy as it is&#13;
in the "official" economy.&#13;
In our case, the approach emphasizes the fact that there is a&#13;
demand for currency related to the activities of the parallel market&#13;
economy. In particular, we postulate that the demand for currency in Ghana&#13;
is directly related to the amount of domestic currency that is being traded&#13;
in the black market.&#13;
A. Black Market Exchange Rate Determination&#13;
Using the theoretical model presented in the previous section as&#13;
the basis, we could derive a reduced form equation for the black market&#13;
exchange rate that could be specified for econometric estimation as:&#13;
b&#13;
(29)    ln E  = a0 + aIln e + a2ln M + a3ln X + a4P + e&#13;
where e is an error term.&#13;
Equation (29) gives the principal determinants of the exchange&#13;
rate in the black market derived from the context of our model. They are,&#13;
respectively, the real official exchange rate, the total value of imports,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-&#13;
the total value of exports, and a dummy variable to distinguish between&#13;
periods of aggressive and non-aggressive government policing activities.&#13;
The theoretical model only predicts the sign for the imports coefficient&#13;
a2, which is expected to be positive, and for the exports coefficient&#13;
a3, which is expected to be negative. The sign of the rest of the&#13;
coefficients cannot be determined a priori.&#13;
From the same context of the model, it is clear that the&#13;
existence of smuggling and faked invoicing vitiate the accuracy of the data&#13;
on total exports and total imports as compLled by official statistics. .1!&#13;
It is clear then that we have a problem of errors in variables and that the&#13;
method of instrumental variables has to be used for the estimation.&#13;
Official statistics of imports and exports are used as suitable proxy&#13;
variables, and domestic GDP and an index oi foreign GNP are used as the&#13;
respective instruments. This method of est:imation also takes care of the&#13;
actual endogeneity of imports and exports not being considered in the&#13;
partial equilibrium framework of the model. 32/&#13;
The period of estimation is 1972-1982, and quarterly data are&#13;
used. 33/    Table 4 presents the regression estimates of equation (29).&#13;
31/ This problem on the accuracy of foreign trade statistics has been&#13;
noted by many writers over a long period of time. A classical article&#13;
related to this subject was written by Morgenstern (1950).&#13;
32/ This underlines the fact that equation (29) is only based on our&#13;
partial equilibrium model but tries to integrate a more general&#13;
equilibrium framework. We do not do this in a formal way.&#13;
33/ The complete data set used for the estimation is presented in Appendix&#13;
B together with the definition and sources of data.&#13;

D. W. Statistic       1.608&#13;
**   Significant at the 1 percent level.&#13;
*    Significant at the 6 percent level.&#13;
All coefficients but one, that of exports, are significant at the&#13;
one percent level. The export coefficient is significant at the six&#13;
percent level. Both imports and exports have the expected sign. The&#13;
equation seems to explain a substantial part of the variation in the black&#13;
market exchange rate as shown by the relatively high adjusted R2,&#13;
although a correction for serial correlation is required.&#13;
We can now analyze the relationships which could not be deter-&#13;
mined a priori in the theoretical model. There is a definite negative&#13;
relationship between the real official exchange rate and the black market&#13;
exchange rate. By letting the real official exchange rate appreciate, the&#13;
government in Ghana has been losing an important amount of foreign exchange&#13;
related to the exports that are now being smuggled out of Ghana instead of&#13;
going through official channels. This has meant an important reduction in&#13;
the amount of foreign exchange allocated to imports and therefore an&#13;
increase in the demand for smuggled imports in the economy. This process&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65-&#13;
has evolved hand in hand with the continuous fall in the ability of the&#13;
country to export and to produce import substitutes that is related to the&#13;
appreciation of the official exchange rate. In all, the real appreciation&#13;
of the official exchange rate seems to be very much related to the&#13;
increasing importance of parallel market activities in the economy. With&#13;
higher domestic inflation rates than world inflation rates, the government&#13;
of Ghana, by maintaining a fixed official exchange rate and imposing&#13;
exchange controls, is progressively losing control of the economy as more&#13;
and more transactions are diverted to the parallel markets.&#13;
The dummy variable shows a statistically significant risk premium&#13;
associated with government policing activity. Specifically, we can see&#13;
that there is a 44.6 percent risk premium that is being collected by the&#13;
sellers of forelgn exchange in the black market in periods of significant&#13;
patrolling activity.&#13;
The results are encouraging and give ample support to the key&#13;
determinants of the black market exchange rate derived from the context of&#13;
our model. As a first approximation, the inodel seems to be useful to&#13;
understand the behavior of the parallel market economy in Ghana.&#13;
B. The Size of the Parallel Market Economy&#13;
The empirical evidence we just presented seems to indicate that&#13;
the exchange rate policies pursued by the government of Ghana have led to&#13;
the emergence and growing importance of the parallel market economy in this&#13;
country. We will now try to estimate the size of this economy and its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66-&#13;
evolution in time. 34/ As we mentioned before, it is not possible to&#13;
measure the size of the parallel market economy directly, but we can&#13;
analyze and to some extent measure the traces it leaves in other spheres of&#13;
the economy.&#13;
In recent years, there has been an increasing attention, on the&#13;
part of policymakers, economists and other social scientists, devoted to&#13;
the study of the general phenomenon that goes under the name of underground&#13;
economy. As one should expect, the basic reasons for the existence of this&#13;
phenomenon vary from country to country and so have the methods that&#13;
scholars have used in trying to assess the size of the underground&#13;
economy. 35/&#13;
We use the general methodology developed by Tanzi (1982), in&#13;
which he estimates the underground economy and tax evasion in the United&#13;
States. In our case, the approach emphasizes the fact that there is a&#13;
demand for currency related to the activities of the parallel market&#13;
economy. In particular, we postulate that the demand for currency in Ghana&#13;
is directly related to the amount of domestic currency that is being traded&#13;
in the black market.&#13;
34/ This is an appropriate time to mention that the emergence of a&#13;
parallel market economy is not only related to exchange control&#13;
policies. It is the foreign trade regime as a whole, as defined in&#13;
Bhagwati (1978), that determines the behavior of the parallel market&#13;
economy.&#13;
35/ A basic book for the reader that covers this broad subject is Tanzi&#13;
(1982). It presents a good survey of the different methods that have&#13;
been used to measure the underground economy, as well as a nice&#13;
compilation of empirical studies for a variety of countries. In&#13;
general, this book shows that economists have risen to the challenge&#13;
of trying to measure something that up to now was considered&#13;
relatively unmeasurable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-67-&#13;
ln this way, the method of estimating the size of the parallel&#13;
market economy involves a two stage procedure. First, the amount of&#13;
domestic currency traded in the black market has to be determined. This&#13;
is, of course, an unobservable variable. '4e can, therefore, only estimate&#13;
a proxy variable for the amount of domestic currency traded in the black&#13;
market. We do this by estimating the quantity of cocoa smuggled out of&#13;
Ghana. Cocoa smuggling is admittedly the miain supplier of foreign exchange&#13;
to the black market in Ghana.    Therefore, by estimating the amount of cocoa&#13;
smuggled we can approximate the amount of foreign exchange supplied in the&#13;
black market, and get a first approximation to the amount of domestic&#13;
currency traded in the black market. Second, we use this proxy variable in&#13;
the estimation of the demand-for-currency equation. This gives an estimate&#13;
of the amount of: "illegal money" in the economy, which can then be&#13;
transformed into a GDP estimate of the parallel market economy by assuming&#13;
that the velocity of mney is the same in the parallel market economy as it&#13;
is in the "official" economy.&#13;
1. Cocoa Smuggling and the Amount of Domestic Currency&#13;
Traded in the Black Market&#13;
The growing of cocoa is Ghana's most important economic activity.&#13;
This key sector has contributed in the last few years about 10 percent of GDP,&#13;
generated around 60 percent of export earnings, and has been a significant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-68-&#13;
source of government tax revenue. 36/ It has also been the main source of&#13;
foreign exchange to the black market.&#13;
But, although cocoa smuggling is a widely accepted phenomenon in&#13;
Ghana, and every study related to the cocoa sector discusses the fact that&#13;
smuggling has increasingly become a significant feature of this sector, there&#13;
has been no real analytical effort to determine its magnitude. Educated&#13;
guesses vary from one source to another and suggest that the amount of cocoa&#13;
being smuggled annually out of the country may go from about 10,000 tons to&#13;
50,000 tons. Franco (1981) puts together a set of guess-estimates of Ghanaian&#13;
cocoa officials and international cocoa traders for 1960-1979. This is&#13;
presented in Table 5.&#13;
These figures show in a quantitative fashion the perceived&#13;
importance of cocoa smuggling in Ghana. The extreme concern of government&#13;
officials about the impact of this activity has also been translated into&#13;
political action. On September 21, 1982 all of Ghana's land borders were&#13;
closed. One of the main reasons given was to prevent smuggling into&#13;
neighboring Togo and Ivory Coast. In 1983, George Agyekum, the chairman of&#13;
the country's public tribunal, stated that cocoa-smugglers will be executed by&#13;
firing squad. He also announced an anti-smuggling operation in the cocoa-&#13;
growing region of Brong-Ahafo. 37/&#13;

In all, it is clear that cocoa smuggling is a very important&#13;
activity in Ghana. We will now try to determine its behavior in time. As&#13;
explained before, this is done as a necessary step to estimate a proxy&#13;
variable for the amount of domestic currency traded in the black market which&#13;
will then be used to estimate the size of the parallel market economy in&#13;
Ghana.&#13;
(a) The Econometric Model&#13;
All the information on cocoa production is provided by the Cocoa&#13;
Marketing Board (CMB). 38/ But, for this reason, the data corresponds to&#13;
cocoa sales to the CMB instead of total production. With a given amount of&#13;
production available in any year, the farmers face the decision of where to&#13;
sell that production. On the one hand, they can sell it directly to the CMB&#13;
and get the official price for cocoa in return. On the other hand, they can&#13;
smuggle it out of the country, sell it to farmers in a neighboring country and&#13;
then change the corresponding amount of foreign exchange in the black&#13;
market. This process can be captured by:&#13;
(30)                     QCMB = s(PS) Qt(v)&#13;
This equation gives the basis for the econometric estimation that&#13;
will follow. It states that total cocoa sales to the CMB, QCMB' is a&#13;
38/ The CMB, organized in 1950, is the sole government agency responsible&#13;
for organizing and financing the local purchases and transport of&#13;
cocoa beans to port or to local processing plants. It is also solely&#13;
responsible for selling Ghanaian cocoa abroad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-&#13;
fraction s of total cocoa production, Qt (which we do not observe). This&#13;
fraction s is a function of the ratio of producer prices in Ghana and its&#13;
neighboring countries,  'PS where the producer price in the neighboring&#13;
country is translated into Cedis using the black market exchange rate. Total&#13;
cocoa production is, in itself, a function of a set of variables v which&#13;
will be discussed in detail shortly.&#13;
This type of specification is very convenient, not only because it&#13;
allows us to estimate the supply equation with the data provided by the CMB.&#13;
But, in addition, the estimates obtained can then be used to determine the&#13;
amount of cocoa smuggled out of Ghana, Qs, by:&#13;
(31)               - ~~~~(l-s)Q&#13;
(31)                   Q 3s    s     CMB&#13;
Specifying Qt(v) is an extremely difficult task. Fairly detailed&#13;
supply equations for major Ghanaian regions were specified and estimated by&#13;
Bateman in March 1972. 39     His method has then been used in the econometric&#13;
estimations for the cocoa; sector within the Bank. H{ere, we will use the&#13;
specification of Qt(v) being used in the Bank. Nevertheless, we encourage&#13;
the reader that is interested in the theory and previous results to consult&#13;
World Bank (1972) and Wocld Bank (1983).&#13;
The econometric specification of equation (30) is given by:&#13;
(32)  ln Q      aC  + a ln PCAP + a2ln P + a3ln R + a4lnP +&#13;
39/  See World Bank (1972).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72-&#13;
The explanatory variables are:&#13;
(i) Production Capacity (PCAP).&#13;
The econometric model developed by Bateman contains two equations.&#13;
The first phase equation attempts to capture the average production capacity&#13;
(PCAP) of the available tree stock. The second phase accepts the capacity&#13;
projections generated in the first phase and attempts to estimate the&#13;
deviations caused by price and weather conditions. This type of specification&#13;
distinguishes between the long-run relationships affecting the secular trend&#13;
of supply (which are assumed additive), and the short-run relationships&#13;
causing its year-to-year fluctuations (which are assumed multiplicative).&#13;
The specification that is now being used in the Bank uses the tree&#13;
stock variable, as defined by Bateman, as a proxy of the average production&#13;
capacity. 40/ This type of specification allows the two equation model to be&#13;
estimated by a single equation since all the relationships in the model are&#13;
now multiplicative, and use the CMB data on production for the estimation.&#13;
In the absence of planting and tree stock data, Bateman used real&#13;
producer prices to construct the proxy variable. This is defined as:&#13;
40/ This is only one of the three variables used by Bateman to estimate&#13;
the average capacity. The other two variables are: survival variable&#13;
and Gammalin yield variable. The first one captures the effects of&#13;
Gammalin application, which is an insecticide, on the survival of&#13;
young trees. The second one explains the effects of Gammalin on the&#13;
yield of mature trees. However, these variables have not been incor-&#13;
porated in recent estimations of the supply equations in the Bank for&#13;
the regions we are interested in. The implicit assumption being made&#13;
is that the effect of insecticides on the average capacity is already&#13;
being captured by the proxy of the tree stock variable. This comes&#13;
from the strong correlation found between insecticide sales and real&#13;
producer prices. For a detailed explanation see World Bank (1983),&#13;
p. 16.&#13;

where    Ct = exp (-W/t ) when   fit &gt; 0&#13;
Ct =              otherwise&#13;
and      Pt = Pt     t  when  Pt &gt;  t&#13;
0 2        otherwise&#13;
t&#13;
The proxy variable for the tree stock in a given year is a weighted&#13;
sum of past real producers prices,   Pt, less planting costs, P , over the&#13;
average length of tree lLfe (55 years is assumed in this study). The product&#13;
of the price incentive, Pt, and the farmer effort coefficient, Ct, is a&#13;
proxy for the plantings of any given year. The sum of this product over the&#13;
past 55 years would deter-mine a proxy for t:he tree stock. But to determine&#13;
the effect of the tree st:ock on production, the plantings of the past 55 years&#13;
must be weighted by a yield coefficient, bi. Yield is a function of age.&#13;
Therefore, the contribution of trees planted in year    t-i,   1 &lt; i &lt; 55,    to&#13;
capacity in year t is the plantings (the product of the price incentive and&#13;
farmer effort) weighted by the yield coefficient for trees which are i years&#13;
old. The summation of this weighted value over 55 years becomes the proxy for&#13;
the productive tree stock or average production capacity. The farmer's effort&#13;
qoefficient and tree yield coefficients used here are those of Bateman.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-74-&#13;
(ii) Real Producer Prices (P)&#13;
Current prices have a cumulative effect upon production because they&#13;
affect, in any year, both harvesting and farm maintenance. The price&#13;
variable P, which is constructed to capture both of these effects, is&#13;
computed as a three-year moving average of the real producer price centered on&#13;
the last year. Thus, farm maintenance during the previous two years is&#13;
assumed to affect output. One period lag is used for this variable to&#13;
consider the fact that the cocoa production year October to September is being&#13;
treated as January to December.&#13;
(iii) Rain (R)&#13;
Heavy rainfall during the latter half of the year collects below&#13;
ground and supports the trees during the dry season. It takes a period of&#13;
twelve to eighteen months for changes in soil-moisture levels to be reflected&#13;
in tree developments. Therefore, the rain variable is constructed by lagging&#13;
the July-October rainfall by one or two periods.&#13;
(iv) Ratio of Producer Prices Faced by the Farmer (PS)&#13;
As explained before, the amount of cocoa sold to the CMB is a&#13;
fraction of total production. This fraction depends on the ratio of producer&#13;
prices in Ghana and the neighboring country where cocoa may be smuggled to,&#13;
PSI where the producer price in the neighboring country is translated into&#13;
Cedis using the black market exchange rate. In this way, the econometric&#13;
specification defines the fraction of total production sold&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

to the CMB, at time t as: 41Y&#13;
(34)                 st = (P  )&#13;
t&#13;
(b) Estimation of the Cocoa Supply Equation&#13;
The difficulties involved in moving cocoa from one place to another,&#13;
now exacerbated by the serious transportation problem in Ghana, indicate that&#13;
most cocoa smuggling has to be done from the regions located near Ghana's&#13;
borders. From the six major cocoa-producing regions in Ghana, three of&#13;
them: Brong-Ahafo, Western, and Volta, have this characteristic.&#13;
The first two share a border with Ivory Coast, and the last one shares it with&#13;
Togo.&#13;
The supply equation (30) is estimated here for the Brong-Ahafo and&#13;
Volta regions 42/. The relevant ratio of producer prices faced by farmers,&#13;
P., is different in both regions. For the Brong-Ahafo region,&#13;
41/ The econometric specifiction of equation (32) does not allow us to&#13;
a 4                 a4&#13;
distinguish between   st = (P t)   and st = b (P) S     .   We assume, for&#13;
all our computations, that the scale factor b is equal to one.&#13;
Unfortunately, there is no way of testing the validity of this&#13;
assumption.&#13;
42/ The econometric work done by Akiyama (some of which is reported in World&#13;
Bank (1983)) on the Western region seems to indicate that the production&#13;
trend in this region does not follow Bateman's specification. This&#13;
precludes the estimation of cocoa smuggled out of the Western region&#13;
using equation (30). Further work on this region seems to be necessary&#13;
to be able to estimate the share of cocoa that is being sold to the CMB&#13;
in this region, and the related amount of cocoa smuggled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-&#13;
this ratio is computed using the producer price of cocoa in Ivory Coast as the&#13;
neighboring-country price. Correspondingly, the producer price of cocoa in&#13;
Togo is used for the Volta region. For notation purposes, we distinguish&#13;
these two variables as PSIc and PST respectively. Most of the data used for&#13;
the estimation is obtained from data used in World Bank (1983). We reproduce&#13;
these figures, together with our own, in Appendix B. The results of the&#13;
estimation are presented in Tables 6 and 7.&#13;

In the supply equation estimated for the Volta region the only&#13;
significant variable is the ratio of producer prices faced by the farmer,&#13;
PST. Two of the variables, PCAP and RV(-2), have the wrong sign although they&#13;
are not statistically different from zero. As a whole the equation does not&#13;
perform as expected by the original specification, and it is not used to&#13;
estimate the amount of cocoa smuggled to Togo.&#13;
The supply equation for the Brong-Ahafo region, on the other hand,&#13;
does seem to support our initial specification. The signs are as expected,&#13;
positive for all the variables. All of them with reasonable statistical&#13;
significance except for the price variable. The regression equation is&#13;
significant at the one percent level. And the equation explains a substantial&#13;
part of the variation of the cocoa sales to the CMB in the Brong-Ahafo region,&#13;
although a correction for serial correlation is required. The coefficient for&#13;
pSIC, which is the one needed to estimate the amount of cocoa smuggled to&#13;
Ivory Coast, is significant at the 1.6 percent level.&#13;
From the supply equation for the Brong-Ahafo region we can,&#13;
therefore, proceed to estimate the amount of cocoa smuggled out of this region&#13;
to Ivory Coast. The estimates are derived as follows. For each year, the&#13;
fraction of total production sold to the CMB can be calculated by using&#13;
equation (34) with the estimated coefficient for PSIC. Then, using these&#13;
estimates in equation (31), the amount of cocoa smuggled to Ivory Coast can be&#13;
calculated. These estimates are presented in Table 8.&#13;

Analyzing the fraction of total cocoa production that is being&#13;
sold to the CMB in the Brong-Ahafo region, s, there seems to be an&#13;
obvious decline in farmers' incentives to sell cocoa to the CMB. By 1982&#13;
only 70 percent of total available production was being sold to the CMB.&#13;
The fall in production as seen by the government, that is, the fall in&#13;
QCMBBR, is not only related to the fact that by maintaining low real&#13;
producer prices the government is not giving the necessary incentives for&#13;
cocoa farmers to plant new trees and take proper care of existing ones, but&#13;
also to the significant amount of cocoa that is being smuggled out of Ghana&#13;
for a better return. In 1982, the producer price in Ghana was only 30&#13;
percent of the price in Ivory Coast at the black market exchange rate (see&#13;
Table B3 in Appendix B).&#13;
The estimates on the amount of cocoa smuggled to Ivory Coast are&#13;
presented in column (3) of Table 8. All estimates lie between the&#13;
boundaries of educated guesses we talked about before. 43/ Comparing our&#13;
estimates with the educated guesses presented in Franco (1981) we can see&#13;
that they are different. Nevertheless, we think that we can rely on them&#13;
with a greater degree of confidence. In particular, our estimates seem to&#13;
capture an interesting fact that the numbers given by Franco do not.&#13;
According to Pick's:&#13;
Black market transactions in Ghana's currency did not&#13;
reach sizeable proportions until late 1964 and remained&#13;
43/       Besides those presented by Franco (1981), there are only a few&#13;
available "guess-estimates" but, for example, our estimate for 1981 is&#13;
very close to the estimate of 20,000 tonnes of cocoa smuggled to Ivory&#13;

mostly limited to the local trade, centering in Accra.44/&#13;
Our estimates indicate that the amount of cocoa smuggled to Ivory&#13;
Coast from the Brong-Ahafo region did not reach any sizeable proportions&#13;
until 1966. Actually, during three years in the preceding period smuggling&#13;
seems to have taken place from Ivory Coast to Ghana. And it is not until&#13;
1965 that this trend shifted back again.&#13;
The amount of cocoa smuggled can then be converted into the&#13;
related amount of Cedis traded in the black market. These calculations are&#13;
presented in column (4). And it is these figures that are used as a proxy&#13;
variable for the total amount of Cedis traded in the black market, in the&#13;
following part of this paper.&#13;
2. The Size of the Parallel Markcet Economy&#13;
Econoraists have used a number of alternative approaches to the&#13;
measurement of the underground economy. A good summary of these approaches&#13;
is presented in the first chapter of Tanzi (1982), entitled "Measuring the&#13;
Hidden Economy: Though This be Madness, There is Method in it" and written&#13;
by B. Frey and W. Pommereline. As they show, the number of methods to&#13;
measure the underground economy is related to the different traces it may&#13;
leave in other spheres of the economy. The! approach we use here lies&#13;
within, what they call, the monetary sphere.    It was used by Tanzi (1982)&#13;
to estimate the underground economy and tax evasion in the United States,&#13;
and is based on the derivation of a demand-for-currency equation. A very&#13;
44/        Pick's Currency Yearbook (1979), p. 261.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-82-&#13;
important advantage of using this approach for a developing country, is&#13;
that monetary data are generally the most reliable ones within the official&#13;
statistics.&#13;
The method consists in specifying a demand-for-currency equation&#13;
that measures the sensitivity of currency demand to black market activi-&#13;
ties, which then gives an estimate of currency held for parallel market&#13;
transactions. From this illegal currency, estimates of the parallel market&#13;
economy can then be derived.&#13;
The specification of the demand-for-currency equation used by&#13;
Tanzi (1982) is actually derived from a very comprehensive study of the&#13;
factors that determine the demand for currency written by Phillip Cagan&#13;
(1958). In this study, the various factors that might affect the ratio of&#13;
currency to money (defined as M2) were identified. In particular, three&#13;
main explanatory variables were underlined: (i) the cost of holding&#13;
currency; (ii) the expected real income per capita; and (iii) the rate&#13;
of tax on transactions. Black market activities were also postulated as a&#13;
possible variable affecting currency demand but were found not to be&#13;
important for the case under study: the United States.&#13;
Both types of illegal activities, tax evasion and black market&#13;
activities, use currency to conceal their transactions. The means of&#13;
transaction in the underground economy is, because of its illegal nature,&#13;
predominantly cash.&#13;
Of these two illegal factors that affect currency holdings in an&#13;
economy, Tanzi (1982) concentrates his effort on the effect of tax evasion&#13;
on the currency ratio in the United States. In our case, the approach&#13;
emphasizes the role of black market activities in the determination of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-83-&#13;
currency ratio Ln Ghana.&#13;
The specification of the demand for currency relative to total&#13;
money used for the estimation is given by:&#13;
(35)                 ln C/M2 = a + a1ln R + a2 ln Y + a31n DCTBM&#13;
+ a4D + E&#13;
where the ratio of currency holdings, C, to money, defined as M2, is the&#13;
dependent variable, and where the explanatory variables are:&#13;
(i) The cost of holding currency (R).&#13;
A rise in the opportunity cost of holding currency leads people&#13;
to substitute deposits for currency, and conversely. We can then expect R&#13;
to be negatively correlated with C/M2 . The foregone cost of holding&#13;
currency is measured here by the current rate of interest on time deposits.&#13;
(ii) Real income per capita (Y).&#13;
The income elasticity of deposits is expected to be greater than&#13;
that of currency. A rise in real income would then lead to a decline in the&#13;
currency ratio.&#13;
(iii) Domestic currency traded in the black market (DCTBM).&#13;
An increase in the amount of domestic currency traded in the&#13;
black market is expected to lead to an increase in the demand for currency&#13;
in the economy.&#13;
But, as we mentioned before, the total amount of domestic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-84-&#13;
currency traded in the black market is an unobservable variable. We use&#13;
here, as a proxy for this variable, the amount of domestic currency traded&#13;
in the black market that is related to the cocoa smuggled out of Ghana.&#13;
This proxy variable is computed in the preceding part of this paper. But,&#13;
this means that we have a problem of errors in variables since the domestic&#13;
currency traded in the black market is measured with error. Other cocoa&#13;
smuggled as well as other sources of foreign exchange to the black market&#13;
are omitted. For this reason, the method of instrumental variables is used&#13;
for the estimation.  5/&#13;
From the estimation of the black market exchange rate equation in&#13;
the first part of this section, we know that the real official exchange&#13;
rate can be used as an instrumental variable for the total amount of&#13;
domestic currency traded in the black market. We do this for the&#13;
estimation.&#13;
In order to be able to solve equation (35) for the case in which&#13;
we assume that no domestic currency is traded in the black market, the&#13;
Cedis traded in the black market computed in the preceding section are&#13;
transformed into an index form by dividing all the numbers in column (4) of&#13;
Table 8 by 855233.15, which is the amount of Cedis traded in the black&#13;
market in 1982. We then define DCTMB as one plus the above index.&#13;
45/       This method of estimation also takes care of the possible&#13;
endogeneity of the amount of domestic currency traded in the&#13;
black market with respect to the currency ratio. Blejer (1978)&#13;
shows that the black market exchange rate is related to monetary&#13;
disequilibriums in the economy.&#13;

(iv) Dummy variable for "unruly situations" (D).&#13;
As Taylor (1979) points out "all people prefer cash in hand to&#13;
checking deposits in the bank in unruly situations". 46/   We construct a&#13;
dummy variable that captures these type of situations, i.e., military&#13;
coups, etc., in Ghana for the period under study.&#13;
Equaltion (35) is estimated for the period of 1965 to 1982. We&#13;
use 1965 as the starting year for the estLmation based on Pick's perception&#13;
that it is in this year when black market activities reached a sizeable&#13;
proportion. As mentioned before, the method of instrumental variables is&#13;
used for the estimation.. The data used in the estimation is reproduced in&#13;
Appendix B. The results are presented in Table 9.&#13;

The adjusted R2 is relatively high and the regression equation is&#13;
significant at the one percent level. The D. W. statistic is 2.4, suggest-&#13;
ing absence of first-order serial correlation. The latter also suggests&#13;
that no important variable has been omitted from the theoretical specifi-&#13;
cation. All the variables have the right signs except the real income per&#13;
capita variable, Y. But the latter is not significantly different from&#13;
zero. The coefficient for DCTBM, which is the one needed to estimate the&#13;
values of currency holdings that are related to parallel market transac-&#13;
tions, is positive and significant at the 3.4 percent level.&#13;
The first necessary step to estimate the size of the parallel&#13;
market economy is to obtain the values of currency holdings related to&#13;
parallel market transactions. 47/    To do so we use the estimated equation&#13;
in two different calculations. First, we determine the predicted value of&#13;
the equation (C/M2) , for each particular year. Second, assuming the&#13;
amount of domestic currency traded in the black market to be zero we&#13;
determine the corresponding (C/M2) by solving the equation with DCTBM&#13;
equal to one for each and every year. Then, given the actual figures of&#13;
M2, we can calculate the predicted levels of currency holdings,     C,  for&#13;
the case that considers the actual amount of domestic currency traded in&#13;
the black market, and    C,  for the case that assumes there are no parallel&#13;
market activities.   The difference between these two predicted values,&#13;
C - C,    gives the estimation of how much currency is held to carry out&#13;
parallel market transactions. It yields an estimate of the "illegal money"&#13;
in the economy. These estimates are presented in Table 10.&#13;
47/       From this point on we proceed following Vito Tanzi's&#13;
methodology. For a detailed description of this methodology see&#13;
Tanzi (1982).&#13;

We can then use the estimates of illegal money to estimate the&#13;
size of the parallel market economy in the following way. We subtract the&#13;
amount of "illegal money" from the total money in circulation, Ml, to&#13;
determine the corresponding figure of "legal money." The income velocity&#13;
of legal money is then obtained by dividing GDP by legal money. Finally,&#13;
assuming that the velocity of legal money is the same for illegal&#13;
money, 48/ we can multiply illegal money by the income velocity of legal&#13;
money to obtain an estimate of the parallel market economy. These results&#13;
are presented in Table 11.&#13;
48/       This is clearly a debatable assumption.   But, as Tanzi (1982)&#13;
points out, it is not clear whether the velocity of illegal money&#13;
is below or above that of legal money. In any case, as Cagan&#13;
(1958) argues, it is hard to believe that the assumption that&#13;
they are equal is grossly inaccurate.&#13;

The yearly estimates of the parallel market economy presented in&#13;
Table 11 show the increasing importance of parallel market activities in&#13;
the Ghanaian economy. From a situation where parallel market activities&#13;
were nearly non-existent in 1965, the parallel market economy rose almost&#13;
steadily to 32.4 percent of official GDP in 1982.&#13;
We should again emphasize that these results cannot be taken as a&#13;
precise measure of the parallel market economy; they are, at best, broad&#13;
indications of trends, and also of orders of magnitude because they are&#13;
sensitive to the assumptions made, as well as the data used. 49/ However,&#13;
as shown in Figure 12, the trend they seem to follow is very clear. The&#13;
government has been losing control over the economy as more and more&#13;
transactions are being diverted to the parallel markets. This has&#13;
important policy implications which we now turn to analyze in the next&#13;
section of the paper.&#13;
49/       For example, these numbers could be underestimating the parallel&#13;
market economy based on the fact that some of the transactions in&#13;
this economy can be expected to be carried out in CFA Francs,&#13;
other foreign currencies or directly in goods, avoiding the use&#13;
of domestic currency completely.&#13;

V. CONCLUSIONS: SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS&#13;
OF THE EXISTENCE OF A PARALLEL MARKET ECONOMY&#13;
The model developed in this paper provides important insights&#13;
into the way in which exchange controls modify the behavior of the&#13;
different agents in the economy, leading to the creation of a parallel&#13;
market economy. The empirical work done for the case of Ghana seems to&#13;
indicate that this particular aspect of the effects of exchange controls in&#13;
an economy can be very important. We now turn to analyze some policy&#13;
implications of the existence of this parallel market economy.&#13;
For this analysis, let us consider the typical scenario in which&#13;
a government pursuing an unwarrantable expansionary policy, imposes&#13;
exchange controls to avoid a loss in reserves, and to control the alloca-&#13;
tion of the scarce foreign exchange. In this scenario, the emergence of a&#13;
parallel market economy has important consequences which should be&#13;
considered by the policymaker. Some of them are the following:&#13;
(1)     Persistent loss of control on the allocation of foreign&#13;
exchange.&#13;
The emergence of a parallel market in response to the&#13;
imposition of exchange controls, and the continuous depreciation&#13;
of the exchange rate in this market leads the exporting sector to&#13;
shift an increasing fraction of its exports to parallel markets.&#13;
This means that the supply of foreign exchange to the government&#13;
decreases over time and, therefore, the amount of foreign exchange&#13;
the government is able to allocate will also be falling. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-93-&#13;
control. the government was aiming for is being eroded over time by&#13;
its own inflationary policy.&#13;
But the control the government is losing over time does&#13;
not onl.y refer t:o the amount of foreign exchange it can&#13;
allocate. As the gap between demand and supply of foreign&#13;
exchange in the official market wi.dens, the number of requests for&#13;
import licenses increases while the number of licenses that can be&#13;
given is reduced. This makes the job of allocating foreign&#13;
exchange a more difficult one. Thte costs of maintaining the&#13;
exchange control. system keep on increasing, not only because the&#13;
administrative process keeps on gr owing, but because as&#13;
policymakers find themselves caught up in running the control&#13;
system, there tends to be an increase in the discriminatory&#13;
process of foreign exchange allocation. As Leith (1974) points&#13;
out: "Failure to recognize the ol.d adage that quantitative&#13;
controls work best when they are needed least lies at the heart of&#13;
the matter. 50/&#13;
Furthermore, the rise in. the amount of resources spent&#13;
in rent-seeking activities nourishes an environment conducive to&#13;
corrupt practices within the government. So, even if the&#13;
prescribed criteria to allocate foreign exchange follow strict&#13;
economic considerations, the final outcome may be quite different&#13;
from the one being pursued.&#13;
50/      J. Leith (1974), p. 163.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-94-&#13;
As time goes by, the control the government thought it&#13;
was gaining by imposing exchange controls may not be more than a&#13;
mere illusion, for which the economy will be paying harshly.&#13;
(2) Loss of tax revenue.&#13;
We know that, independently of the parallel market&#13;
economy, exchange controls deprive the government of revenue that&#13;
could otherwise be captured through tariffs. In addition, there&#13;
is a loss in government revenue associated with the existence of a&#13;
parallel market economy. As the black market exchange rate&#13;
depreciates, the fraction of exports that is channeled through the&#13;
official market keeps falling. This also implies that the amount&#13;
of official imports is being cut. For countries in which trade&#13;
related taxes are an important source of government revenue, this&#13;
process means a significant loss in revenue.&#13;
In turn, this loss in revenue may imply that the&#13;
government will need to finance its increasing deficit by&#13;
borrowing from the central bank. This will only exacerbate the&#13;
original expansionary policy and start the cycle over again.&#13;
Imposing exchange controls to avoid a balance-of-&#13;
payments disequilibrium when an unwarranted expansionary policy is&#13;
being pursued not only does not solve the original problem, but it&#13;
may also tend to nourish it. The medicine can then be worse than&#13;
the sickness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-.95-&#13;
(3)     Exchange controls do not avoid the "undesirable"&#13;
consequences of a devaluation.&#13;
The imposition of exchange controls as a substitute for&#13;
a formal devaluation does not avoid the adverse repercussions onl&#13;
prices or real wages of a devaluation. The emergence of a&#13;
parallel market in response to such controls and the depreciation&#13;
of the exchange rate in this market have similar consequences to&#13;
those of an official devaluation.&#13;
With a widespread parallel market economy, most of the&#13;
prices of importable goods will be determined by their marginal&#13;
costs in the parallel market. This means that as the black market&#13;
exchange rate depreciates, the price of importables will rise.&#13;
Avoiding a loss in reserves through exchange controls does not&#13;
come without tears, as the government might expect. The reduction&#13;
in the purchasing power of domestic goods does represent a real&#13;
cost, namely, a reduction in the standard of living.&#13;
The existence of a parallel market economy has, in all three&#13;
cases, a significant effect on the repercussions that follow the imposition&#13;
of exchange controls.   These reverse links between the parallel market&#13;
economy and exchange controls can actually preclude the achievement of&#13;
policy objectives pursued by the government through the imposition of&#13;
exchange controls, i.e., control of foreign exchange allocation, etc. It&#13;
is important for policymalcers to be aware of these consequences when they&#13;
plan to impose exchange controls as a balance-of-payments policy.&#13;

APPENDIX A&#13;
EXCHANGE CONTROL POLICY IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 1/&#13;
All of the countries that impose exchange controls rely on similar&#13;
instruments. However, the degree of control and the authority with which they&#13;
are used differs between countries. These differences will be highlighted in&#13;
this cross-country comparison of exchange control policies that focus on the&#13;
agencies which oversee exchange control, the surrender requirement of foreign&#13;
exchange proceeds, the restrictions on import transactions, the restriction on&#13;
non-resident accounts, and the restrictions on currency brought in and out of&#13;
the country. The main differences will be summarized in the text; country-&#13;
by-country details can be found in Table Al.&#13;
It is not our purpose to provide the most recent description of the&#13;
exchange controls in Sub-Saharan Africa, but to give a flavor of their variety&#13;
and the type of instruments they use. The analysis is made on the basis of&#13;
the latest IMF publication on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions,&#13;
which is the 1983 Annual Report. Changes from that date on are not&#13;
incorporated in the analysis.&#13;
*    This appendix was written by Janet Entwistle.&#13;
1/   The analysis in this appendix refers basically to the countries&#13;
in Group I of Table I. In addition, Cape Verde, Equatorial&#13;
Guinea, and Sao Tome and Principe were considered. These are&#13;
member countries that impose exchange controls, but are generally&#13;
not considered in the Sub-Saharan studies in the Bank because they&#13;
are such small economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-97-&#13;
Multiple Exchange Rates&#13;
Guinea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, and Uganda quote two separate exchange&#13;
rates based on an official market and a commercial market. The official&#13;
market is generally for transactions relating to essential imports, and all&#13;
official transactions. In Sierra Leone and Uganda, specified traditional&#13;
export transactions are also made at the official rate.    The rest of the&#13;
transactions are carried out through the commercial market.&#13;
Other countries follow practices which lead to multiple exchange&#13;
rates in a more subtle way. Many countries place a tax or service charge on&#13;
the sale of foreign exchange, as is the case in Equatorial Guinea.    Other&#13;
countries have export bonus schemes, for example Ghana and Kenya. In&#13;
addition, many countries have import deposit schemes. Rwanda, for example,&#13;
requires an advance import deposit for some automobiles.&#13;
Exchange Control Policy and Administration&#13;
Exchange control policy is generally made by a ministry of the&#13;
government, for example, the Ministry of Finance. However, in some countries,&#13;
for example in Somalia, a committee comprised of various ministries and/or the&#13;
Central Bank advises on policy questions. In other countries, a ministerial&#13;
committee actually sets policies, as is the case in Zambia. In Cape Verde,&#13;
the Central Bank is the final authority on all exchange transactions.&#13;
The Central Bank always handles the administration of foreign&#13;
exchange except in Madagascar where the Directorate of the Treasury is in&#13;
charge. In some countries, for example, Guinea Bussau, the Central Bank is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-98-&#13;
the sole authority. Most countries delegate authority to other banks. In&#13;
Ethiopia, for example, authorized banks can perform all foreign exchange&#13;
related functions of the Central Bank. In Nigeria, even certain hotels and&#13;
rest houses can purchase foreign currency.&#13;
The administration of import and export licenses is usually handled&#13;
by a ministry, for example the Ministry of Commerce. In some countries, the&#13;
Central Bank must approve the awarding of license, as in Mauritania, whereas&#13;
in other countries the ministry is the authorized body, for example in Sierra&#13;
Leone. In Guinea, a state enterprise grants licenses for trade. In Tanzania,&#13;
on the other hand, export and import license are handled by separate&#13;
entities; the Central Bank controls imports and the Ministry of Trade&#13;
controls exports.&#13;
Surrender Requirements of Exchange Proceeds&#13;
The surrender of all foreign exchange proceeds from both exports and&#13;
invisibles to an authorized bank is required. Sometimes the only authorized&#13;
bank is the Central Bank; other times the responsibility is delegated to&#13;
commercial banks. In Zaire, authorized banks can keep all foreign exchange&#13;
from invisibles, but surrender 30 percent of export receipts to the Central&#13;
Bank. In other countries, for example, Uganda, all proceeds must be&#13;
surrendered by the authorized banks to the Central Bank within three business&#13;
days of receipt.&#13;
Some countries require that payment for exports be in foreign&#13;
currency. Others require payment in a "convertible" currency. Still others&#13;
will accept domestic currency or the currency of the recipient country. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-99-&#13;
Ghana, there is an export bonus of 20 percent if payment is in an African or a&#13;
convertible currency. In many countries, such as Rwanda, the Central Bank&#13;
must approve th,e currency of payment.&#13;
When payment is in a foreign currency, it generally must be&#13;
surrendered to an authorized bank. However, the due date of surrender varies&#13;
from as little as three days to as much as six months. In Tanzania, payment&#13;
must be collected within six months of date of shipment and sold to an&#13;
authorized bank within three business days. While in Cape Verde, export&#13;
proceeds must be surendered within three months of the date of the issuance of&#13;
the license.   If payment is from Rwanda's neighbors, proceeds must be&#13;
surrendered 30 clays after shipment; otherwise, the time period is 120 days.&#13;
Some countries have more checks on compliance of the surrender&#13;
requirement than other countries.    For example, some countries require&#13;
domicilation of all expor;t transactions, whereas others require domicilation&#13;
of such transactions only valued above a specified amount. This is the case&#13;
in Madagascar, where the exporter must also sign a commitment to repatriate&#13;
any foreign currency proceeds. In Sao Tome and Principe, the exporter must&#13;
not only domicile his export transactions, he must also have a license. In&#13;
Nigeria, exporters must sign an export control declaration at the time of&#13;
shipment. Some countries, like Uganda, require an export license for all&#13;
exports; other countries, for example Mauritius, only require a license for&#13;
exports valued above a certain amount. Tanzania has a much stricter export&#13;
procedure; the exporter must register with the Central Bank, have an account&#13;
with a commercial bank, and acquire an export license.&#13;
CountrLes with multiple exchange rates require some firms to&#13;
surrender their Eoreign currency at one exchange rate and other firms at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100-&#13;
another exchange rate. For example, in Sierra Leone all export proceeds may&#13;
be surrendered at the commercial rate except for proceeds from a few specified&#13;
exports. In Guinea 40 percent of export proceeds must be converted at the&#13;
official rate, and 60 percent are auctioned to producers by the Central Bank.&#13;
Complete surrender of foreign exchange proceeds from exports is not&#13;
required in all countries. In Nigeria, foreign exchange received in payment&#13;
for petroleum is exempt. Retained accounts at banks abroad are permitted in&#13;
Botswana for residents who make frequent foreign payments. These accounts are&#13;
subject to ceilings. In Sudan, exporters can retain some of their export&#13;
proceeds for the purchase of goods and services related to their export&#13;
business. This foreign exchange must be kept with an authorized bank and&#13;
resold if not used within a specified period of time. In other countries, for&#13;
example Mauritius, large import/export companies can retain export proceeds in&#13;
order to meet import payments.&#13;
Partial surrender of proceeds from invisibles is permitted only in&#13;
Sudan, where residents can keep all foreign exchange except that earned&#13;
through tourism. The time period to meet the requirement also varies with&#13;
invisibles. Surrender is required within 15 days in Equatorial Guinea, while&#13;
in Zimbabwe a "reasonable period of time" is sufficient.&#13;
Restrictions on Import Transactions&#13;
Foreign exchange for imports is generally allocated through&#13;
licensing. The importer must apply for a license through the appropriate&#13;
agency, and on approval foreign exchange can be purchased. This is the case&#13;
for all the countries except Mauritius where foreign exchange must be applied&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-&#13;
for separately.  However, the extent of llcensing varies considerably across&#13;
countries.&#13;
An arnnual import program and a monthly license budget is drawn up in&#13;
Equatorial Guinea, where a license is required for all imports.    In contrast,&#13;
many countries allow some imports under an open general license. For example,&#13;
in the Gambia, there is an open general license for most imports, but the&#13;
government prohbibits some items for social, health or public policy reasons.&#13;
Often goods are prohibited because they are produced locally, are considered&#13;
non-essential, or are considered a threat to public safety (as in the case&#13;
with weaponry and narcotics). In Guinea-Bissau licenses are issued according&#13;
to the availability of foreign exchange, except for imports of essential&#13;
foodstuffs which are controlled by a state monopoly. In Sudan, where there is&#13;
a multiple exchange rate. system, essential imports are transacted at the&#13;
official rate and other imports are transacted at the free market rate. In&#13;
Zaire, only an import declaration is necessary if the importer finances his&#13;
imports outside of the banking system. Finally, many countries, including&#13;
Cape Verde, require a license only for goods valued above a specified limit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-&#13;
Restrictions on Non-Resident Accounts&#13;
Most countries place restrictions on the accounts of non-&#13;
residents. However, these accounts differ in respect to which currency they&#13;
can be denominated in, whether they are interest bearing, whether they are&#13;
transferrable, who can open them, and what their funds can be used for.&#13;
In some countries, non-residents can open accounts only in domestic&#13;
currency, while in other countries accounts may be held in foreign currency.&#13;
In Burundi, non-residents temporarily residing in the country can only hold&#13;
domestic currency accounts whereas non-residents living abroad can hold&#13;
accounts in foreign currency. In Ethiopia, non-residents may hold both&#13;
domestic and foreign currency accounts, but both must be credited only with&#13;
foreign exchange. In Sierra Leone, on the other hand, all non-resident&#13;
accounts are denominated in domestic currency.&#13;
In Burundi, non-resident accounts do not bear interest, whereas in&#13;
Zambia, not only are some accounts interest bearing, but the interest is also&#13;
transferrable.&#13;
Some countries keep non-transferrable funds of non-residents in&#13;
Blocked Accounts. These accounts hold funds that are due to non-residents&#13;
that are, for example, in excess of their emigration allowance or are from&#13;
disinvestments. Approval is always required from the government for debits or&#13;
credits. Most other funds in non-resident accounts are freely&#13;
transferrable. One exception is Tanzania where balances from non-convertible&#13;
non-resident accounts can only be transferred with approval.&#13;
In many countries embassies and the foreign officials of embassies&#13;
are required to open non-resident accounts. This is the case in Cape Verde.&#13;
Other non-resident accounts are held by former residents who still have funds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103-&#13;
in Blocked Accounts, or by non-residents with an interest in holding them.&#13;
All countries place strict restrictions on the nature of credits and&#13;
debits to non-resident accounts. Generally, transactions through these&#13;
accounts must be authorized.&#13;
Restrictions on the Import and Export of Currency&#13;
All countries place restrictions on the import and export of&#13;
currency by travelers. Once more, the extent of these restrictions varies&#13;
across countries.&#13;
The import and export of domestic currency is prohibited in Cape&#13;
Verde, as it is in many of these countries.. In contrast, in the Gambia an&#13;
unlimited amount of domestic currency can be brought into the country, but&#13;
only a limited amount can be re-exported.   However, most countries allow the&#13;
import and export of a specified limited amount of domestic currency.    Some&#13;
countries, for example, Tanzania, only allow resident travelers this option,&#13;
in order that they will have domestic curre!ncy with them upon their return to&#13;
meet their local expenses.&#13;
Restrictions on the import and export of foreign currency are also&#13;
widespread. Gen-erally, foreign travelers may import unlimited amounts of&#13;
foreign currency, and upon departure can take the same amount with them&#13;
(usually less local expenses). However, non-residents generally must apply&#13;
for foreign exchange. The amount allocated for travel purposes usually&#13;
depends on the nature of the trip, i.e., whether the journey is for tourist&#13;
travel, business travel, medical reasons. or education. Some countries, for&#13;
example Zaire, do not allocate any exchange for tourist travel, but do for&#13;
official travel. In Zaire, airline tickets can be purchased with domestic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104-&#13;
currency, but exchange needed must be obtained outside of the banking system.&#13;
Remittances abroad by foreign nationals working in Africa are&#13;
generally allowed up to a certain percentage of their income. However,&#13;
remittances abroad by residents are often prohibited, as is the case in&#13;
Tanzania.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
All twenty-five countries examined here have similar types of&#13;
exchange control policy although they implement this policy to varying&#13;
degrees. In summary, in almost all 25 countries, (1) there is a practice&#13;
which leads to multiple exchange rates, (2) the Central Bank is the primary&#13;
administrator of exchange control policy, (3) exchange proceeds for exports&#13;
and invisibles must be surrendered to the government, (4) most items cannot&#13;
be imported freely, (5) there are restrictions on non-resident accounts,&#13;
and (6) currency cannot be imported and exported freely.&#13;

commercial banks and authorized dealers. Exchange Control&#13;
policy is determined by the Ministry of Finance and Trade.&#13;
Ghana:           The Central Bank administers the allocation of foreign&#13;
exchange. The Controller of imports and exports at the&#13;
Ministry of Trade issues licenses and enforces the import&#13;
program drawn up by a committeee of secretaries (representing&#13;
various ministries). Foreign exchange transactions must be&#13;
made through authorized banks.&#13;
Guinea:          The Central Bank is in charge of Exchange Control under the&#13;
supervision of the Presidency. Import and export licenses&#13;

Source:   Black Market Rates were obtained from Pick's Currency Yearbook (various issues).   Because black&#13;
market activity was negligible in Ghana from 1960-1962, and in the CFA countries from 1960-1970,&#13;
the official rates from the IMF, International Financial Statistics were used for those years.&#13;
Cocoa Prices for Ghana and the Ivory Coast wereb obtained from the data used for World Bank&#13;
(1982).  For Togo, different World Bank Country Economic Memoranda were used.   The cocoa price for&#13;
Togo in 1962 is an estimakte.&#13;

            Exchange controls and the parallel market
            economies in sub-Saharan Africa
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper provides a theoretical
            framework to understand the way in which exchange controls
            modify the behavior of the different agents in the economy,
            leading to the creation of a parallel market economy. It
            gives the necessary theoretical elements to analyze this
            parallel market economy and provides a simple methodology to
            obtain relevant quantitative information about it. Finally,
            the paper elaborates on some of the policy implications of
            the existence of a parallel market economy. The model
            developed shows that the parallel market activities can be
            explained through the optimizing behavior of exporters and
            importers, which determines the amount of import and export
            smuggling, the level of the rent-seeking activity, and the
            black market exchange rate that is consistent with an
            equilibrium position where no one has any more incentives to
            move from their attained position. A method to detect the
            presence, and assess the magnitude of the parallel market
            economy, as well as to explain its behavior quantitatively,
            is then developed and applied to the case of Ghana.
