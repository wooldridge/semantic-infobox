            Jobs and the crisis
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In response to the financial and
            economic crisis, many countries sought to stimulate labor
            demand, facilitate job search and preserve skills, and
            protect income. While little information is available about
            the impact of these interventions, there is some evidence
            that they involved a substantial number of people despite
            limited budgets. At the same time, there are concerns about
            the effectiveness of programs, particularly in low- and
            middle- income countries. The challenge now is to revise the
            policy mix to maximize the impact of the recovery on
            employment creation.
