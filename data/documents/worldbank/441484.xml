        <abstracts>
            In 1989, the Government of Guinea
            entered into a lease arrangement for private sector
            operation of water services in the capital city, Conakry,
            and sixteen other towns. The lease has been broadly
            successful --in the first five years, it led to a big
            increase in the population with access to safe water. But,
            because the risk sharing between the parties to the lease
            has proved difficult to implement and enforce, improvements
            have been smaller than hoped for. The author reviews the
            lease's performance, drawing lessons for water projects
            in other countries.
