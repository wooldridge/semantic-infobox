Uganda Economic Update | Sixth Edition, september 2015 |report no. 99060&#13;
&amp;#12;What is the Uganda Economic Update?&#13;
&#13;
The Uganda Economic Update (UEU) takes stock of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic developments to provide up-to-&#13;
date information and analysis on the recent economic performance, challenges, and opportunities. Drawing on&#13;
global experience, the UEU proposes options for consideration by Government in order to facilitate economic&#13;
growth, eliminate extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. The UEU is published by the World Bank on&#13;
a six monthly basis. The sixth UEU had a special focus on â&#128;&#152;Landâ&#128;&#153; and was published in September 2015.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Why is the Update published every six months?&#13;
&#13;
The UEU is aligned to the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budgetary process, which carries a time frame of 12 months. The&#13;
schedule of six monthly updates provides room for providing timely inputs into the budget formulation for the&#13;
subsequent year, and to assess progress of implementation of policies and make requisite adjustments where&#13;
necessary.&#13;
&amp;#12;Why is an Update important for Uganda?&#13;
&#13;
The UEU provides a regular platform to discuss and reflect on topical issues that are affecting the&#13;
economy. In this respect, the UEU brings together policy makers and key stakeholders to debate&#13;
and inform the policy formulation process. The UEU is selective, aiming to focus on current issues&#13;
that require attention for policy makers to formulate ideas and take action on growth and inclusive&#13;
development.&#13;
&amp;#12;What is the current State of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s economy?&#13;
&#13;
The Ugandan economy continued to recover from the low growth recorded since financial year 2010/11,&#13;
which was the most resent election year. During the year ending June 2015, the economy grew by 5.0 percent,&#13;
compared to 4.5 percent of the previous year. However, growth remained below expectation, and was the&#13;
slowest amongst regional peers such as Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. Prices had remained stable and the&#13;
cost of credit had reduced, thereby providing a much needed boost to private investment and consumption.&#13;
The Government had planned to continue to pursue a strategy of addressing the countryâ&#128;&#153;s deficient physical&#13;
infrastructure, but this had not fully materialized because of implementation challenges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What are the main challenges for Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s economy?&#13;
&#13;
With planned Government infrastructure investments taking off only slowly, and the exports remaining&#13;
weak, the main driver of economic activity in the private sector was the increased credit from the banking&#13;
sector. At the same time, the country had suffered from shocks affecting the economy in varied ways, both in&#13;
the past and in the near future.&#13;
&#13;
First, the prolonged low international oil prices reduced the countryâ&#128;&#153;s oil import bill and had a deflationary&#13;
effect on domestic prices, but has been an important factor in the decisions on investments related to&#13;
production of oil within the country. Relatedly, foreign direct investment, the bulk of which has come into&#13;
&amp;#12;this sector, declined during FY 2014/15 and will remain subduded in FY 2015/16.&#13;
&#13;
Second, the shilling has reduced value significantly, reaching a level which is 35&#13;
percent lower than what it was in the corresponding period of 2014. This depreciation&#13;
is consistent with the low net flows of foreign exchange into the country and hence&#13;
could promote competitiveness, but it increased pressures on domestic inflation.&#13;
&#13;
Third, the tightening of monetary policy will minimize inflation and hence ensure&#13;
stability, but it will increase the cost of borrowing and hence reduce the rate of&#13;
investment by the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
Fourth, at the regional level, the political turmoil in neighboring Burundi, and the civil&#13;
conflicts in South Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo, have major implications&#13;
to Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s economy, particularly through lower exports of goods and services, lower&#13;
tourism receipts, and lower FDI, if investors consider regional risks to be as important&#13;
as country specific risk.&#13;
&#13;
Lastly, as the country prepares for its next presidential and parliamentary elections&#13;
in February 2016, both uncertainty and speculation have and will continue to impact&#13;
economic variables, a phenomenon that is common in many other parts of the world.&#13;
&amp;#12;What is the economic outlook for Uganda?&#13;
During financial year 2015/16, the Ugandan economy will on balance, continue to grow, the effects of the shocks&#13;
notwithstanding. However, the forecasted overall rate of growth for the year of 5.4 percent, will be about a half&#13;
a percentage point from what had been anticipated when the Government pronounced its budget strategy in&#13;
June 2015. The rate of growth is projected to accelerate to at least six percent per annum into the medium term.&#13;
This outlook greatly depends on the success of the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s huge investment program, which aims to build&#13;
energy dams to increase availability and reduce cost of electricity; build roads to ease connectivity; and constract&#13;
the refinery to raise the value of the oil before it is exported out of Uganda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While addressing these constraints would improve the business climate and encourage more private sector&#13;
investment, firms will still have to manage their activities in a quite volatile macroeconomic environment in&#13;
the near term on account of uncertainties and speculation related to elections, and an unpredictable external&#13;
environment that may have adverse effects on the value of the currency and the market for Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s goods on&#13;
international markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The sixth UEU argues that above all this, the most critical challenge is to identify policies and actions that can&#13;
raise productivity and incomes for agriculture and low income non-agriculture firms, where most of the people&#13;
are employed currently; or to facilitate people to shift into those areas where productivity is high and incomes&#13;
for workers can rise fast. One critical factor for such a transformation to take place is the manner in which land is&#13;
managed in Uganda.&#13;
&amp;#12;What is the state of land tenure security in Uganda?&#13;
Land tenure in Uganda has evolved tremendously over the past                Figure 1: Composition of Four Land Tenure Systems in Uganda&#13;
century, resulting into four types of land tenure systems (see Figure&#13;
1). The type of tenure system operated for a particular piece of land         4% Freehold tenure&#13;
                                                                                                                       2% Leasehold tenure&#13;

&#13;
Unfortunately, in Uganda these elements are still weak, which has led&#13;
to unclear ownership of land and a high rate of occurrence of disputes&#13;
and conflicts. As a result, only a small proportion of land in Uganda is&#13;
                                                                            14% Mailo tenure&#13;

transformation and development in Uganda.&#13;
&amp;#12;What is the cost of tenure insecurity and inefficient markets?&#13;
Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s rapidly expanding population is placing increasing pressure on land usage. This has significant&#13;
implications for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s productivity. If properly managed, an increase in population density can actually&#13;
support economic growth, but to make that possible, policies to promote optimal use of land must be in place&#13;
in both rural and urban areas, to support the transformation of economic activities. The following are some of&#13;
the indicators of costly land management:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Slow transformation of agriculture: Land disputes are estimated to reduce the level of agricultural&#13;
     growth in Uganda by between 5 and 11 percentage points. Small farms are not able to achieve high levels&#13;
     of productivity, while low productivity large farms co-exist with a number of promising commercialization&#13;
     and agro-industry businesses failing to expand due to lack of a system that could facilitate efficient and&#13;
     fair sell or rental of land, especially in areas with communal land ownership.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Access to finance constrained by limited land registration: Financial institutions in Uganda typically&#13;
     require collateral for over 86.5 percent of the loans. The limited existence of easily transferable legal titles&#13;
     leaves the bulk of land as â&#128;&#152;dead capitalâ&#128;&#153; that cannot be demobilized for development nor expand the&#13;
     deposit base of financial institutions. This leaves the cost of credit high.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Urban areas not supporting economic development: Urban authorities lack access to the land required&#13;
     for the necessary public works and social infrastructure. This, together with the lack of enabling site and&#13;
&amp;#12;     building standards, has resulted in urban centers that are not developing&#13;
     efficiently, with these areas often characterized by horizontal expansion     Urban areas becoming&#13;
     rather than more profitable high-rise buildings. For this reason, urban          large slums and not&#13;
     centers in Uganda still have low economic density, not allowing them&#13;
                                                                                     supporting economic&#13;
     to generate growth, jobs and decent housing for their increasing&#13;
     populations. If current patterns continue, the process of urbanization&#13;
                                                                                    development - Urban&#13;
     will result in proliferation of slums; increased congestion; and a                authorities do not&#13;
     deterioration in the quality of, or a failure to develop, infrastructure       have access to the land&#13;
     due to an escalation in the costs of construction and payment of             required for the necessary&#13;
     compensation.                                                                 public works and social&#13;
â&#128;¢	   High cost of compensation makes infrastructure development costly:                 infrastructure..&#13;
     Authorities are struggling to afford high compensation rates involved in&#13;
     the acquisition of land due to highly inflated land prices. This is caused&#13;
     by the lack of available alternative investment opportunities and the&#13;
     need in many cases to pay compensation not only to registered land&#13;
     owners, but also to bona fide occupants.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Mismanagement of land systems promoting corruption: Land&#13;
     transactions are often braced with very high transaction costs, mainly&#13;
     resulting from corruption.&#13;
&amp;#12;How should land in Uganda be managed in order to support the&#13;
transformation process?&#13;
&#13;
Drawing on global lessons, particularly from countries in Africa that share many of the same characteristics as&#13;
Uganda, the sixth UEU recommends four points of action. The first two build on what has already been initiated by&#13;
the Government, while the other two are intended to bridge unaddressed gaps.&#13;
&#13;
I.	   Accelerate the process of systematic registration of land including land owned communally, by religious and&#13;
      cultural institutions, and by Government. Low cost technologies, as seen in Rwanda, can raise the proportion of&#13;
      land registered well beyond the current level of only 20 percent.&#13;
&#13;
II.	 Redesigning the Land Fund to enhance its efficiency and equity in supporting resolution of overlapping rights.&#13;
&#13;
III.	 Strengthening Institutions for Land Administration Management, including for dispute resolution; for&#13;
      documentation, information storage and retrieval, and valuation; and for urban authorities finances to allow&#13;
      them acquire land and pay for infrastructure development.&#13;
&#13;
IV.	 Reviewing and prioritizing the many existing policy commitments that already exist to identify and close critical&#13;
     gaps such as in restrictions on rental markets, disincentives such as taxation for speculative holding of land,&#13;
     urban land use, discrimination against women in landownership, and expropriation and compensation to&#13;
     promote equity and fairness in land transactions.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      Â&#134;Â&#134; In 2006, 37 percent of land in Uganda&#13;

   either public or private mailo land                                                   not be rented; and 44 percent could&#13;
                                             transfer a piece of land&#13;

&#13;

            Searching for the 'grail' : can
            Uganda's land support its prosperity drive?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Over the past twenty years, Uganda’s
            population density has been increasing rapidly, placing
            significant pressure on the use of land. Uganda now has a
            population density of 194 persons per square kilometer of
            arable land, compared to 80 in Kenya and 116 in Ghana. At
            present, the majority of Uganda’s population still lives in
            rural areas, where the main source of livelihood is
            agriculture. However, the proportion of the population
            living in urban areas has increased significantly and will
            continue to increase into the future, with urban centers
            being the main driver of economic growth and transformation
            into higher value added activities. The highest rates of
            growth in population density are recorded in Uganda’s
            central region. It is essential that Uganda changes the
            manner in which it manages its land if the majority of its
            population is to achieve a higher level of prosperity
            through the healthy transformation of the agricultural
            sector and a shift towards higher value, more productive
            economic activities more generally. Through the formulation
            and implementation of smart policies, Uganda can ensure that
            its land serves as a more productive asset that facilitates
            positive transformation and a diversification of the
            economic base. The achievement of these goals will require a
            comprehensive set of actions that will promote security of
            land tenure and reduce the rate of occurrence of conflicts
            and disputes caused by overlapping rights; promote the
            healthy development of rental markets for land; and
            strengthen the capacities of institutions responsible for
            the management of land administration. Failure to unlock the
            potential of land may result in a deceleration of growth and
            lack of progress towards prosperity. In addition, rather
            than driving equitable economic growth, the process of
            urbanization will result in dysfunctionality in the form of
            the proliferation of slums; increased congestion; and a
            deterioration in the quality of, or a failure to develop,
            infrastructure due to an escalation in the costs of
            construction and payment of compensation. Implementation of
            relevant up to date laws and policies has to be accelerated
            to make land in Uganda genuinely secure, transferable,
            marketable and supportive of economic development.
