"E-government is an aspect of the whole issue of governance, the whole issue of the development&#13;
of the digital revolution, the whole issue of how you address the questions of poverty, how one&#13;
addresses the question of the digital divide...You cannot simply ignore the fact that technology&#13;
has the prospect of giving a huge advantage to one segment of the world, leaving behind another&#13;
segment of the world with an even greater gap to catch up."&#13;

&#13;
As part of its Governance program, the Poverty Reduction and Economic Reform Division of the&#13;
World Bank Institute (WBIPR) has sought to strengthen parliamentary oversight ­ in part, by&#13;
improving parliaments' representative function and its own accountability to the electorate. In&#13;
parallel, efforts have been made within WBIPR and elsewhere in the Bank to promote&#13;
e*government as a means to improve governments' efficiency and effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
This paper primarily looks at how e*parliaments--the use of ICT to improve parliamentary&#13;
processes--have developed, considers possible future directions and advocates the adoption of a&#13;
three-stage model of e*parliament, which will relate strongly to both e-government and e-&#13;
democracy.&#13;
&#13;
If the application of ICT to parliaments seems nowadays inevitable, then inevitable will be its&#13;
impact on the functioning of parliamentary institutions. The development of `e-parliaments' will&#13;
transform both the ways in which parliaments operate as well as their representative function. The&#13;
potential to transform parliaments centres on three main areas:&#13;
    Increased administrative efficiency&#13;
    Improved information access and dissemination&#13;
    Enhanced interaction with citizens&#13;
&#13;
These three areas can be translated into a model of three stages of developments of e-parliaments,&#13;
which if adopted could herald a transformative process that affects in a fundamental way the way&#13;
citizens relate to the state. E*parliaments have the potential to fulfil a role in improving&#13;
governance and hence enthusiasm for democracy and the engagement of people with political&#13;
processes.&#13;

1     Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A short definition of on-line governance has been provided by the global survey on on-line&#13;
governance undertaken by UNESCO and the COMNET-IT Foundation. The survey defined it as&#13;
a resource providing citizens with access to computer-mediated information, service delivery or&#13;
dialogue in liaison with government at any level.1&#13;
&#13;
There has been a series of international global conferences and initiatives investigating the&#13;
potential of e-government. This culminated in 2001 in the 'Third Global Forum on Fostering&#13;
Democracy and Development Through e-government' that took place in Naples, Italy from 15-17&#13;
March. At the invitation of the Italian government, more than 1 000 representatives from 122&#13;
countries, including many government ministers, the multilateral agencies, the business&#13;
community and non-governmental organisations came together. There was a wide ranging debate&#13;
which highlighted the key challenges facing governments in the design and implementation of e-&#13;
government strategies to meet the expectations and demands for more accessible, transparent and&#13;
accountable government. The findings and conclusions reached set a challenging agenda for&#13;
future work.2 This is only one conference of many3 and most international organisations, and&#13;
some governments and not for profit organisations now have working groups or on-line&#13;
information portals on the subject.4&#13;
&#13;
This paper examines the progress of the debate on the impact of Information and Communication&#13;
Technology [ICT] on governance and the possible future influence of ICT on the development of&#13;
democratic systems of Government. The paper cannot hope to cover the diversity and range of&#13;
current debate but is designed as a stimulant to creative thinking on the relationship between e-&#13;
governance and democracy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          A definition of e-government:&#13;
&#13;
"e-government refers to the use by government agencies of information technologies (such as&#13;
Wide Area Networks, the internet, and mobile computing) that have the ability to transform&#13;
relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government.&#13;
&#13;
These technologies can serve a variety of different ends: better delivery of government services to&#13;
citizens, improved interactions with business and industry, citizen empowerment through access&#13;
to information, or more efficient government management. The resulting benefits can be less&#13;

corruption, increased transparency, greater convenience, revenue growth, and/or cost&#13;
reductions.&#13;
&#13;
Traditionally, the interaction between a citizen or business and a government agency took place&#13;
in a government office. With emerging information and communication technologies it is possible&#13;
to locate service centres closer to the clients. Such centres may consist of an unattended kiosk in&#13;
the government agency, a service kiosk located close to the client, or the use of a personal&#13;
computer in the home or office.&#13;
&#13;
Analogous to e-Commerce, which allows businesses to transact with each other more efficiently&#13;
(B2B) and brings customers closer to businesses (B2C), e-government aims to make the&#13;
interaction between government and citizens (G2C), government and business enterprises (G2B),&#13;
and inter-agency relationships (G2G) more friendly, convenient, transparent, and inexpensive.&#13;
&#13;
e-Commerce has evolved already through four stages: 1) publishing, 2) interactivity, 3)&#13;
completing transactions, and 4) delivery.&#13;
&#13;
To date, most e-government activity has centred on publishing. A study by Anderson Consulting&#13;
finds vast differences among countries in the maturity of their e-government effort. Perhaps the&#13;
key finding, however, is that even the most mature countries have tapped less than 20% of the&#13;
potential."5&#13;

2     Theories of Public Participation and the Role of ICT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To appreciate the potential impact of ICT on democratic systems of government, an exploration&#13;
of the varied forms of democratic participation and their application is needed.&#13;
&#13;
The word democracy is derived from the Greek - demos, "the people" and kratein, "to rule". Now&#13;
the dominant form of government in the world, democracy is in fact a relatively recent&#13;
phenomenon that takes many forms. In common parlance, `democracy' is used to describe a&#13;
system whereby people exercise the right to vote in free and fair elections for representatives who&#13;
are meant to exercise control over a government and its institutions.&#13;
&#13;
It is only when one begins to examine the various systems of government that are termed&#13;
`democratic' that the model tends to become fragmented. No two democratic systems are exactly&#13;
the same; but this does not mean that there are no universal standards against which systems can&#13;
be judged.&#13;
&#13;
The striving for perfection in models of democracy has been the Holy Grail of political theorists.&#13;
From the Greek philosophers through to the cyberspace utopianists, political theorists have&#13;
constructed models designed to increase the level of public participation in democratic forms of&#13;
government.&#13;
&#13;
It is generally accepted that the greater (in terms both of quantity and quality) the public&#13;
participation, the more representative government is likely to be. The more accountable the&#13;
government is for its actions, the more likely it is that decisions will be made in the interests of&#13;
the majority. The greater the transparency of government decisions the more likely they are to&#13;
take into account the people's wishes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Crudely, models of democracy can be divided into three areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.1     Direct Democracy&#13;
&#13;
2.1.1 THEORY AND PRACTICE&#13;
&#13;
This is the purest form of democracy whereby every adult in a state is directly involved in every&#13;
major decision.&#13;
&#13;
Every citizen actively participates in decision making through regular opportunities to meet, to&#13;
discuss options and then to express their will. This was the ideal form of democracy favoured by&#13;
the Greek political theorists and, indeed, by many utopian writers from Thomas More to William&#13;
Morris.&#13;
&#13;
Although attractive to utopian thinkers, direct democracy has never been introduced as a practical&#13;
form of state government. Geographical and physical limitations on information-sharing and&#13;
decision making has meant that direct democracy has only successfully been applied at the local&#13;
level in communes, co-operatives and villages. There are very few examples of even these small-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                         e-Parliaments 5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
scale experiments taking place as they have often proved to be inherently unstable and fall prey to&#13;
more powerful and aggressive (if less democratic) neighbouring political systems.&#13;
&#13;
2.1.2 ICT IMPLICATIONS&#13;
&#13;
At first glance, the new information and communication technologies seem to offer great&#13;
possibilities in facilitating direct democracy.&#13;
&#13;
This is the view endorsed by the more ardent of the cyberspace utopianists who argue for a world&#13;
government of the people by the people. In the wilder realms of political futurology all decisions&#13;
at a global and local level will be taken by everyone using ICT to create a global interactive&#13;
parliament. This would remove the need for the election of representatives, as everyone would be&#13;
able to represent their own views.&#13;
&#13;
It is true that the possibilities of information provision and ease of communications could, in&#13;
theory, make this possible but it is plain to see that it is as unrealistic as the dreams of earlier&#13;
advocates of political utopias. Until there is universal access to the necessary ICT this is no more&#13;
than a dangerous pipe dream that may divert people from the real possible benefits of public&#13;
participation in already-established forms of democracy.&#13;
&#13;
It is possible that there will be opportunities for wider involvement in decision making in the&#13;
future particularly at the local level. But it is noticeable that, so far, efforts to involve people in&#13;
direct decision making through the internet have been fraught with difficulties, and have been&#13;
notable mainly for the very low levels of participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2      Representative Democracy&#13;
&#13;
2.2.1 THEORY AND PRACTICE&#13;
&#13;
This is the most common form of democratic government in the world. The basic principle of&#13;
representative democracy is that the people of a state or locality choose representatives, through&#13;
an electoral process. These representatives are then tasked with holding the government to&#13;
account and scrutinising legislation through an institution such as a parliament or a local council.&#13;
&#13;
In most representative democracies, there is a separation of the legislative and executive&#13;
functions; in some there are separate electoral systems to choose a head of state; and in others a&#13;
bicameral system of scrutinising legislation. The government of the state, commonly made up of&#13;
the political party (or parties) with the most members of the parliament, has control over the&#13;
institutions that implement legislation or administer state functions, such as tax collection or&#13;
foreign policy. This state model is also widely applied to institutions of local government.&#13;
&#13;
Representative democracy has the largest body of political theory associated with it, much of&#13;
which is concerned with the challenge of ensuring that democratic systems function efficiently&#13;
while at the same time retaining their representative effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
The distinction between the elected person being a `representative' rather than a `delegate' of&#13;
their constituents is a source of frequent debate. The 18th century English political philosopher,&#13;
Edmund Burke, talked about representatives having a moral authority to act on behalf of those&#13;
they represent during their period of office, without any need to consult or even to ensure that&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6    Tess Kinghman&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
they reflect the majority of view of their constituents. Contrary to common misconception,&#13;
parliamentary representatives are not `delegates' expected simply to be a mouthpiece for the&#13;
majority (or most vocal) opinions of their constituents.&#13;
&#13;
Most parliamentary representatives stand for election on a political `ticket', a stated set of&#13;
political policies and principles that the voting public can choose to accept (by voting for the&#13;
person or party) or reject. The representative's role is to consider the views of his or her&#13;
constituents but then to decide themselves how to take an issue forward bearing in mind issues&#13;
such as their political party's stance and their personal ethos.&#13;
&#13;
All systems of representative democracy have evolved over time even if a model or blueprint was&#13;
adopted at the outset. Indeed, any political system that did not adapt to changing circumstances&#13;
would be failing to adequately reflect the changing views of the people it represents.&#13;
&#13;
2.2.2 ICT IMPLICATIONS&#13;
&#13;
There is now a new challenge and opportunity - to make this system of democracy more&#13;
representative using the new forms of ICT. In future, ever-improving technology could equip&#13;
people to convey their views to their representatives more easily. The elected representatives will&#13;
in turn be empowered through the internet, and e-mail to make better decisions based on wider&#13;
consultation with those they represent. More effective management and communications systems&#13;
will assist people, through elected representatives, to hold their government to account as they&#13;
will possess vastly increased knowledge of that government's activities.&#13;
&#13;
The Parliaments that have embraced the new technology are already perceived to have become&#13;
more efficient in their internal workings. Individual representatives too have benefited from using&#13;
ICT to extend their knowledge on a vast array of subjects and to enable them to become better&#13;
connected with their electorate or constituency.&#13;
&#13;
There is, however, a danger that this new technology could exacerbate the problems of&#13;
information management for parliamentarians, rather than improving their efficiency&#13;
Some representatives in countries where email has become a norm for communication have found&#13;
themselves immediately bombarded with hundreds of e-mails a day, often received from&#13;
organised lobby groups rather than their own constituents. The e-mail overload has clogged their&#13;
office systems making them less rather than more effective in their work. There is also the&#13;
question of how, in an electoral system without defined geographical constituencies, a&#13;
representative could effectively use ICT to improve their representational function.&#13;
&#13;
If, in future, expectations develop that parliamentary representatives should utilise ICT to garner&#13;
views on different subjects in order to reflect the majority position through their political actions,&#13;
the nature of representative democracy will be fundamentally altered. Elected representatives&#13;
would quickly become transformed into delegates.&#13;
&#13;
What's more this approach begs the question - delegates for whom? The dangers of the&#13;
`majority' view being hijacked by organised and wealthy interest groups with the best access to&#13;
the ICT systems becomes obvious. This is a direct challenge to the very principle of&#13;
representative democracy - if ICT becomes a mechanism to permit the voices of those that use it&#13;
most effectively to become dominant in policy-making.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                               e-Parliaments     7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The brief introduction above highlights, above all, that if the appropriate checks and balances are&#13;
not put in place, the use of the new ICT could significantly undermine rather than increase truly&#13;
representative democratic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.3      Participatory Democracy&#13;
&#13;
2.3.1 THEORY AND PRACTICE&#13;
&#13;
Most political theorists have argued that achieving an advanced democratic state goes further than&#13;
merely extending suffrage to previously unenfranchised groups. As governments involve&#13;
themselves more deeply in all areas of a community's life, it is perceived to be important to&#13;
establish much greater public participation in decision-making and for those decisions to be&#13;
made, wherever possible, at the level closest to the people. In this model of `participative&#13;
democracy' it is argued that people will have more of a stake in their locality, their community&#13;
and their state. It can be characterised as being a halfway house between direct and representative&#13;
democracy ­ it retains some of the best features of both systems.&#13;
&#13;
It is qualitatively different from getting input on views on issues as in representative democracy&#13;
since people would be actively participating in making the decisions that affect their lives. It is&#13;
different to direct democracy as people participate in decision-making at the local level but also&#13;
feed up views through a representative system.&#13;
&#13;
Practical examples of participatory democracy, however, have often suffered from a lack of&#13;
active involvement of the local community, an unwillingness of the existing holders of power to&#13;
relinquish control (reluctance to devolve financial decision-making for example) and an inability&#13;
to balance the competing interests of a multiplicity of participatory organisations. For effective&#13;
participatory democracy to operate, there must be real commitment from `the top' to decentralise&#13;
political power. This is a rare principle for central governments to espouse.&#13;
&#13;
The South African constitution has at its heart a commitment to participatory democracy. To date&#13;
it has been difficult for South Africa, a new democracy, to put this desire into practice. In part this&#13;
is a result of the majority of people having a lack of experience of democratic systems of&#13;
government, but it is also because many people are prevented from fully participating owing to&#13;
the daily challenges of poverty which they face6. It has also been argued that this is also due to a&#13;
lack of institutional capacity and inter-governmental disputes, particularly between state and&#13;
provincial levels of Government.7&#13;
&#13;
2.3.2 ICT IMPLICATIONS&#13;
&#13;
Participatory democracy is the form of democracy that could best profit from the harnessing of&#13;
ICT because of improvements in ease of communication and information provision.&#13;
&#13;
Democracy would then be about more than just voting ­ it would be about participating in&#13;
decision making and enabling people to take more control over their own development. This&#13;

would go beyond the on-line provision of information to people, to encompass the development&#13;
of direct methods of involving people in decision making about issues that affect them.&#13;
&#13;
The notion of popular participation in democracy through ICT may sound both positive and&#13;
exciting, but there are hidden threats that must be faced when taking forward any developments in&#13;
this area.&#13;
&#13;
In most democratic systems, the elected parliamentary representative are the ideal conduit&#13;
through which actions necessary for the public good are conveyed to local, regional or central&#13;
government. Elected representatives, responsible to a constituency of voters, are an ideal means&#13;
of keeping the Executive in check and of assuring government accountability. This ideal has not&#13;
always been effective as representatives have chosen to be influenced by other factors such as the&#13;
desire to be appointed to government positions or to obtain monetary or other forms of&#13;
preferment through abuse of their position. If ICT could increase the level of contact between the&#13;
electorate and their representatives they could be made more directly accountable for their&#13;
actions.&#13;
&#13;
If however, through using ICT mechanisms such as mass on-line polls or fora, central&#13;
government can continually by-pass the elected representatives and establish direct contact with&#13;
people, the balance of political power in a state shifts, greatly reducing the role and even the&#13;
necessity of directly elected local representatives.&#13;
&#13;
There is also no guarantee that the vast majority of the population, specifically those in&#13;
developing countries who are marginalised through poverty, would be able to benefit from the&#13;
application of ICT to participative democracy as it is still an exclusive means of communicating&#13;
currently restricted to those with access to resources and power. In addition, the use of ICT in&#13;
`bypassing' elected representatives provides a potential gift for corrupt or dictatorial regimes. The&#13;
Executive would have the ability to control the flow of information and even to manipulate the&#13;
messages, both those received by - and those conveyed to - the public. This could have the&#13;
opposite effect to that envisaged by those who seek to harness ICT to promote participatory&#13;
democracy.&#13;
&#13;
Policy-making would be in danger of being led by populist opinion which would be open to&#13;
manipulation by those with the technical expertise and money to do so.&#13;

3     Democracy and Development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Links Between Democracy and Development&#13;
&#13;
It is now accepted that there is a link between levels of political democracy, whatever the model,&#13;
and levels of economic and social development. It is becoming more widely accepted that the&#13;
more the people are involved in determining their own future through participation in a&#13;
democratic political system, the more they will have a stake in a stable civil environment within&#13;
which economic and social needs can be met.8&#13;
&#13;
This link between democracy and development is thus connected to the widely accepted&#13;
paradigm of social and economic development - the greater the level and the better the quality of&#13;
public participation, the better the outcome.&#13;
&#13;
However, the link is not as clear as some would like to claim. Even the most developed of&#13;
economies had restrictions placed on political participation as they moved from societies based&#13;
on agricultural to industrial production.&#13;
&#13;
In the UK, the right to vote was limited to men until the 20th century, in the USA people of colour&#13;
were not fully enfranchised until after the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The states&#13;
that experienced rapid (if unstable in the long-term) growth rates in the twentieth century were&#13;
not based on a western democratic model. The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany exercised control&#13;
over rights of democratic participation in an effort to accelerate economic development. Even the&#13;
successful economies of South East Asia did not necessarily aspire to developing political&#13;
democracy alongside economic advancement. China is currently experiencing rapid economic&#13;
growth without a political system that conforms to democratic norms. Indeed, some have argued&#13;
that the extension of western models of multi-party democracy to Africa has had a deleterious&#13;
effect on economic development.&#13;
&#13;
What is, however, increasingly obvious is that once states have reached a certain level of&#13;
economic development, then democratic systems of government produce the most stable&#13;
economic growth coupled with the most equitable distribution of wealth. Developed democratic&#13;
systems are the most compatible with developed capitalist economies - freedom of economic&#13;
activity in the market and freedom of political activity appear to be mutually reinforcing.&#13;
Developed democracies are less likely to go to war with each other. Democracies encourage&#13;
gradual political change, which is less disruptive to economic activity. In democratic systems&#13;
economic interest groups have outlets for discontent through the freedom to associate and vote for&#13;
parties with differing political and economic programmes. Elections give the people the&#13;
opportunity to change a government that has prosecuted economic and social policies that are&#13;
perceived to have failed. It appears to be true that the more transparent the democracy - and the&#13;
more that people participate in democratic processes ­ the greater the prospect of stable and long-&#13;
term economic development.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Yet if social and economic development is to be based on the extension of participation in&#13;
democratic systems of government in underdeveloped societies, there is no perfect model to&#13;
follow and no magic wand to wave. But even without a model of democracy it is increasingly&#13;
accepted that successful community-based micro-development is based on a participatory process&#13;
of people articulating and then addressing their needs and aspirations. This lesson is increasingly&#13;
being applied at the macro-economic level by international development institutions. In essence&#13;
development is being democratised.&#13;
&#13;
The lessons of economic development are now also being applied to political development and&#13;
participation is seen as the key.&#13;
&#13;
At the micro level this means empowering individuals to play a full role in their community and&#13;
to build an independent and vibrant civil society.&#13;
&#13;
At the macro level this means:&#13;
1. the building of democratic systems to articulate people's needs and aspirations to accountable&#13;
     representatives;&#13;
2. the exertion of continuing political control over the executive by representatives of the people&#13;
     ensuring that people's aspirations and needs cannot be ignored;&#13;
3. the opening up of the machinery of government to popular scrutiny ensuring that the&#13;
     articulated aspirations and needs are met.&#13;
&#13;
The new tools of ICT can make a positive contribution to these three areas of democratic&#13;
development if the right choices are made and resources are made available.9 But it's clear that&#13;
some caution needs to be exercised if popular disenchantment with political systems is to be&#13;
addressed.&#13;
&#13;
3.2 The "Democratic Deficit".&#13;
&#13;
The term "democratic deficit" is used here to examine the widespread and increasing lack of&#13;
popular engagement in democratic processes. This is particularly acute in the western&#13;
democracies where levels of voting in all forms of elections are falling.10 Young people are&#13;
perceived to be particularly disenchanted with the political process and - as they are the most&#13;
internet and e-mail literate section of society ­ many have expressed the hope that the adoption of&#13;
e-democracy may re-engage them with the political process.&#13;
&#13;
There appears to be very little research to back up this theory. Indeed there is anecdotal evidence&#13;
that would suggest the opposite effect - as people become more and more engaged with the life&#13;
that can be led on the internet through gaming technology, chat rooms and product purchase they&#13;
become less socially and politically engaged.11&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The assumption that people are not engaging in the political process simply because voting&#13;
mechanisms are complex is dangerously simplistic. Underlying this simplistic view is the notion&#13;
that ICT solutions are a panacea that will reinvigorate public political involvement and that if the&#13;
public were given easier access to voting systems using ICT (e.g. through supermarket kiosks or&#13;
through home PC's) they would re-engage in the process. However, the real problem lies with&#13;
more fundamental issues such as general public disillusionment with politicians and public&#13;
alienation from political parties and policies that they consider irrelevant to them or their family&#13;
life. If that is the case a concentration on delivering another way of voting is simply diverting&#13;
attention from the roots of the problem.&#13;
&#13;
The effects of the application of ICT to the processes of democracy must be assessed and&#13;
monitored much more carefully in order to ensure that the application of technology does not just&#13;
add a new dimension to the existing democratic deficit by further excluding people from&#13;
participation in democratic systems of government.&#13;
&#13;
As is so often repeated we are only at the dawning of a new era in ICT. If too much faith is&#13;
invested in the potential of this new technology without a heavy dose of realism the very opposite&#13;
effect may be generated to that anticipated by the visionaries of the brave new world of internet&#13;
democracy. The democratic deficit will deepen. This is particular the case if fundamental&#13;
questions about connectivity and access is not also addressed.&#13;

4      The Digital Divide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.1 Nature and Extent of the Digital Divide&#13;
&#13;
It's likely that the main stumbling block to ICT enhancing democracy will be the "Digital&#13;
Divide". This is often examined purely from the angle of connectivity e.g. how easy is it to get&#13;
on-line in a particular geographical area. Yet, even in technologically advanced countries, internet&#13;
access is nowhere near universal. People on low incomes, the socially disadvantaged and the&#13;
politically unenfranchised are less likely to have access to computers and the internet, rendering&#13;
their ability to participate fully in any internet-based democratic processes unlikely. But lack of&#13;
access is not just about physical access to resources. There are also social, cultural and linguistic&#13;
barriers to access that need to be addressed ­ women12, the elderly, ethnic minorities often have&#13;
low levels of access to ICT in developed countries.&#13;
&#13;
In a recent pamphlet written for the Fawcett Society13 in the UK, Margaret Moran (a Member of&#13;
the UK Parliament) addresses the issue of the participation of women in on-line democracy&#13;
projects. She has her own webpages14 and has been active in organising on-line discussion groups&#13;
in her Luton constituency.&#13;
&#13;
She notes that men tend to dominate the ICT industry ­ and indeed the number of women in&#13;
Information Technology jobs in the UK has recently fallen ­ but that it is possible to facilitate the&#13;
participation of women in groundbreaking projects. The fact that the ICT industry is male&#13;
dominated means that the computer hardware and software are not equality neutral and that this&#13;
means that there is a need to specifically address the involvement of women in both the ICT&#13;
workplace and the creation of content.&#13;
&#13;
The Womenspeak project promoted dialogue between UK MPs and women victims of domestic&#13;
violence. The anonymity of the technology gave women the confidence to speak directly to their&#13;
representatives about their experiences.&#13;
&#13;
Moran concludes:&#13;
&#13;
"The constraints on women's involvement in the traditional methods of democratic participation&#13;
are many; the shortage of time, issues of safety, caring responsibilities, and the tendency for men&#13;
to dominate discussions. The on-line environment offers a number of advantages for women. The&#13;
interactive nature of the internet allows different levels of participation and involvement at times&#13;
and places that are convenient for women's lives. On-line dialogue allows women sufficient space&#13;
to express their views and all experiences are deemed as of equal importance."&#13;
&#13;
It's clear, however, that policy makers will have to strive to ensure that any e-democracy&#13;
initiative is structured to enable women to participate fully in the process.&#13;
&#13;
It must be stressed that the digital divide is not just about connectivity - it is also about levels of&#13;
access. Although steps can be taken that enable the non-literate to use ICT it is likely that people&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 with little or no education will have more difficulty coming to terms with using information and&#13;
 communication tools that are primarily based on the ability to read and write. This is particularly&#13;
 the case as English is the language that predominates on the internet. Other factors relating to&#13;
 cultural and social differences, which mean that gender or other factors such as class, caste or&#13;
 race, reinforce the digital divide.&#13;
&#13;
 Put simply, if participation in democratic processes becomes completely dependent on access to&#13;
 the internet, then it's vital that there be universal access to the necessary ICT tools. If this is not&#13;
 the case, inequalities of access will invariably result in a widening of the democratic deficit even&#13;
 if issues relating to connectivity are addressed.&#13;
&#13;
 In developing countries, the potential to use the internet to improve governance for the benefit of&#13;
 people is severely hampered by both poor connectivity and access to the internet. As Gudrun&#13;
 Kochendoerfer-Lucius stated to a Global Dialogue (GD7) conference: "90% of all internet users&#13;
 are living in the OECD countries and more than half the internet users world-wide (57%) are&#13;
 from the US, despite the US making up just 5% of the world's population. Asia accounts for 17%&#13;
 of all internet users, South America for 2% and Africa for 0.7%. Yet the dimensions of the&#13;
 challenge posed by "the global digital divide" are much larger than even those figures make us&#13;
 believe...with 4.8 billion people living in the developing world, (out of 6 billion people total in the&#13;
 world), and the number of people living in poverty ­ 3 billion living on under $2 a day and 1.2&#13;
 billion living on less than $1 per day."15&#13;
&#13;
                                              Statistics from the&#13;
    International Telecommunications Union World Telecommunication Indicators Database.&#13;
&#13;
According to these indicators, the world population was about 6.095 billion in January 2001.&#13;
For the same period, there were 986 million telephone lines world-wide, of which 541 million&#13;
were in high-income countries, 137 in upper-middle income, 109 in lower-middle income and&#13;
199 in low-income countries...Turning to the internet, almost every country in the world is&#13;
connected, except for a few economies that had no connection as we entered the new century.&#13;
Again, ITU indicators show that there were some 361 million internet users at the beginning of&#13;
the year. These users were spread out as follows: 267 million were in high-income countries, 47&#13;
in upper-middle income, 16 in lower-middle income and 31 in low-income countries. In many&#13;
developed markets, those who want to be on-line already are. However, in developing markets,&#13;
affordability, awareness and relevance are still placing limits on internet growth. Though&#13;
developing markets are growing rapidly, the digital divide remains huge. The infrastructure is&#13;
still not sufficient to allow the internet to become commonplace. In addition, apart from the cost&#13;
of buying a computer, a subscription for access is still beyond the means of a vast majority of&#13;
those in developing countries. These costs must be brought down.&#13;
&#13;
End of year message of Yoshio Utsumi, Secretary-General, I TU, 200116&#13;
&#13;
 Increasing the participation of people in the democratic process through ICT is a high ideal to&#13;
 aspire to but it is a crazy dream to people who do not even have a telephone let alone a computer.&#13;
 Relying on ICT to enhance democracy in conditions where universal access is so far from being&#13;

achieved is, in fact, an inherently anti-democratic stance. Especially when poverty is the ultimate&#13;
barrier.&#13;
&#13;
The lack of access to computers, poor telecommunications systems and the disproportionately&#13;
high cost of internet access are major barriers for developing countries' participation in e-&#13;
governance initiatives. As Bruno Lanvin, Executive Secretary of the G8 Dot Force, World Bank&#13;
has pointed out, "it is not enough to say that reasonable internet access in the US will cost you&#13;
US$20 a month and in Venezuela US$100. What is more important to say is that US$100 a month&#13;
in Venezuela is about 16 weeks of average wage. That gives you an idea of who can really have&#13;
access".&#13;
&#13;
Without effective bridging of the digital divide both in terms of connectivity and access there is a&#13;
very real danger that there will be a tendency to put power into the hands of the more wealthy and&#13;
lobby groups, including the more wealthy but not necessarily more representative international&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
4.2 Emerging Initiatives&#13;
&#13;
Several international initiatives have been set up to instigate a global response to the `digital&#13;
divide'. Among them are the G8 Digital Opportunity Taskforce (DOT Force) and the United&#13;
Nations Information and Communication Technology Taskforce (UN ICT TF). These bodies&#13;
face an enormous challenge because of the significant levels of investment that will be necessary&#13;
to bridge the digital divide, not just between high and low income countries but also between high&#13;
and low income individuals. There is however some reason for optimism.&#13;
&#13;
"Fortunately, recent developments in technology promise to reduce costs and help bring the&#13;
power of information into the hands of large sections of the population. Broadband wireless&#13;
communications coupled with remote computing and converging technologies can revolutionise&#13;
the access to information. Mobile devices, which combine the functions of a phone, computer, a&#13;
television, a pager, a videoconferencing centre, a newspaper, a diary and even a credit card are&#13;
very much on the anvil."17&#13;
&#13;
                                       GrameenPhone in Bangladesh&#13;
&#13;
" The Village Phone program is GrameenPhone's unique method of bringing connectivity to the&#13;
rural areas of Bangladesh. This program enables Grameen Bank's (a microcredit provider)&#13;
borrowers to retail telephone service in their respective villages, and has the potential to&#13;
penetrate the rural areas rapidly and effectively. The Bank operates in 39,172 villages through&#13;
1,138 branches and 12,801 workers and its effectiveness is established through a recovery rate of&#13;
96% from a borrower base of 2.3 million.&#13;
&#13;
A typical Grameen Bank borrower takes a loan of $100 without collateral from the Bank to&#13;
purchase, say, a cow. The cow would then produce milk that the borrower could sell to her&#13;
neighbours enabling her to make a living and pay off the loan. The process allows the poorest of&#13;
the poor to stand up on their feet. In the case of Village Phone, a telephone also acts as an&#13;
income generating mechanism for a borrower; a telephone serves as another "cow." A woman&#13;
borrows about $350 from the Bank and purchases a handset and selsl telephone services to the&#13;

villagers, making a living and thus paying off her loan. It creates a self-employment opportunity&#13;
in each village and provides access to telephones to all.&#13;
&#13;
More than 500,000 subscribers are now using GrameenPhone mobile phones in Bangladesh. It is&#13;
a remarkable achievement within a very short span of time.&#13;
&#13;
Late last year, GrameenPhone was identified by EMC, the London-based mobile phone market&#13;
research firm, as the fastest growing and single-largest mobile phone company in the South Asian&#13;
region. In fact, cell phone users now outnumber the fixed-line telephone subscribers in the&#13;
country. According to newspaper reports, presently there are more than 650,000 mobile phone&#13;
users as against 590,000 fixed-line subscribers in Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
The growth of the subscriber-base of GrameenPhone has been spectacular over the years. The&#13;
average growth was more than 100 percent during the last five years while it was over 200&#13;
percent in 2000 and more than 150 percent last year. By bringing electronic connectivity to rural&#13;
Bangladesh, GrameenPhone is bringing the digital revolution to the doorsteps of the rural poor&#13;
and unconnected. By being able to connect to urban areas or even to foreign countries, a whole&#13;
new world of opportunities is opening up for the villagers in Bangladesh. Grameen Bank&#13;
borrowers who provide the services are uplifting themselves economically through a new means&#13;
of income generation while at the same time providing valuable telephone service to their fellow&#13;
villagers. Thus, the telephone becomes a weapon against poverty."18&#13;
&#13;
Increasingly, internet connectivity is being facilitated by wireless and satellite technology. The&#13;
spread of mobile telephones gives some indication of the willingness of the rural poor to use&#13;
advanced technology. In July 1999, Uganda became the first African country where there were&#13;
more mobile than fixed telephone customers. The growth of mobile communications has been&#13;
phenomenal. At the start of the last decade there were just over 10 million mobile cellular&#13;
telephone subscribers around the world. At the beginning of 2001, this figure had grown almost&#13;
70 times to over 700 million. Around one in ten people around the world now own a mobile phone.19&#13;
If this readiness to adopt mobile telephones can be transferred to new technological advances&#13;
which give access to the internet there is some hope of bridging the digital divide.&#13;
&#13;
There are other initiatives that seek to provide internet access in local communities.20 The ITU,&#13;
for example, have been promoting the Multipurpose Community Telecentre (MCT) since 1997.&#13;
An MCT pilot project is testing how providing a range of ICT support in a public area (like a&#13;
community centre) improves access in remote, rural and undeveloped areas. In Africa, for&#13;
example, Benin, Mali, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda have established MCTs with the&#13;
support of UNESCO, ITU and the International Development Research Centre.21 Cyber cafés are&#13;
also springing up across the world, and they are increasingly centred on providing internet access&#13;
for local people with, for instance, the UNDP funding a project in Egypt.22&#13;
&#13;
Clearly, however, there is still a very long way to go.&#13;
&#13;

5    The Application of ICT to Democratic Processes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.1 Models of Citizen Engagement&#13;
&#13;
Some academic studies of ICT have already examined how technology could be used to enhance&#13;
parliamentary democracy. One useful tool that has been adapted to the e-context is Arnstein's&#13;
`ladder of participation'23 which demonstrates the complex interrelationship between information&#13;
and power strategies.24&#13;
&#13;
The ladder is used by Bellamy and Raab to illustrate the way in which ICT can be used to&#13;
strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the state in controlling and serving people, and&#13;
how, as one moves further up the ladder, ICT can become `citizen technologies' where power&#13;
over decision making is transferred directly to people.&#13;
&#13;
A further adaptation of this model is proposed in this paper as a new means of assessing the&#13;
effectiveness of ICT in buttressing representative parliamentary democracy. The basis of this is&#13;
the following progression:&#13;
&#13;
1. ICT is used to improve the internal workings of parliament ­ [e-parliaments].&#13;
&#13;
2. governments develop increasingly sophisticated sites which enable people to take advantage&#13;
    of information and the on-line provision of services ­ [e-government].&#13;
&#13;
3. ICT makes a contribution to the development of a new form of participatory democracy ­ [e-&#13;
    democracy].&#13;
&#13;
See Fig 1.&#13;
&#13;
The countries that have had the resources to allocate to the application of ICT to governance have&#13;
usually started by improving the workings of parliament, and have moved on to providing better&#13;
information and more services on-line. The next step would be for parliamentarians to embrace&#13;
new ICT technology to improve their representational role. Few members of parliament have as&#13;
yet managed to take this step up the ladder but there are some recorded examples of best practice.&#13;
There are probably more practical examples that could be shared through a training scheme.&#13;
&#13;
If this ladder of progress towards participatory democracy were followed incrementally, the result&#13;
would be a strengthening of the role of parliamentary representatives and democracy itself rather&#13;
than strengthening the direct links between government and the individual citizen at the expense&#13;
of weakening the links between people and their representatives.&#13;

ladder of participation. Arnstein, Sherry R. "A Ladder of Citizen Participation," Journal of the American Planning&#13;

                                   voting and new methods of testing public opinion.&#13;

                                  public opportunities to participate more directly and&#13;
                              collectively in the policy input processes of parliamentary&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the following sections, there are practical examples that show how this ladder has worked in&#13;
practice and the potential for further progress up the ladder of participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.2 e-parliaments - Parliaments as Institutions&#13;
&#13;
Parliaments around the world have begun to harness ICT tools to improve their efficiency as&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The level of development obviously varies and most systems are being constantly updated and&#13;
modified as technology advances. It is the parliaments with the technological capacity and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18    Tess Kinghman&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
resources to devote to the adaptation of existing administrative and information systems that have&#13;
made most progress in this regard.&#13;
&#13;
However as parliaments are usually based in capital cities where internet access is usually good&#13;
and as most parliaments have access to resources it would seem that, even in least developed&#13;
countries, parliaments are beginning to use ICT technology to improve their communication and&#13;
information capacity.&#13;
&#13;
The Canadian House of Commons, like most parliaments in the industrialised world, provides&#13;
each member with a private office with furniture and sufficient office equipment such as&#13;
computers, laser printers, typewriters, TV sets, telephones and other office suppliers. When&#13;
technology allowed it was decided to provide Canadian parliamentarians with internet access as&#13;
part of this package. The internet now serves as the fastest, easiest, most inexpensive tool of&#13;
information gathering and communication.25&#13;
&#13;
India has also made significant steps in developing information technology to assist its national&#13;
parliamentarians with their reference needs.26 In 1985 a computer centre for managing the&#13;
Parliament Library Information System (PARLIS) was set up with the help of National&#13;
Informatics Center (NIC). Various databases have been created (such as Constituent Assembly&#13;
Debates, microfilms of parliamentary proceedings, bills, Parliamentary Committee reports,&#13;
biographical data of Members) which enable parliamentarians and researchers to have access to&#13;
the necessary information about the workings of the national parliament.&#13;
&#13;
In the 1960s, the German Bundestag decided to develop a documentation and information system&#13;
for parliamentary materials using ICT. There were three stages taken for the implementation:&#13;
1. the development of a computerized documentation and information system for parliamentary&#13;
    materials;&#13;
2. the obtaining of information from external databases; and&#13;
3. a simulation of the consequences of laws based on econometric models.&#13;
&#13;
At the beginning, these databases were only a tool of the administrative services that assisted&#13;
members of the Bundestag indirectly,27 but in 1985, members of the Bundestag were provided&#13;
with direct and personal access. This information source now serves as an important resource for&#13;
the representative function of German parliamentarians and people.&#13;
&#13;
The Danish parliamentary website was launched on the internet in 1997.28 The purpose was to&#13;
make parliamentary documents available to people, the business sector and the media. The&#13;
website can also be used to obtain information about debates in the parliamentary chamber, MPs&#13;
and finances. It was set up to serve a functional rather than a democratic purpose. According to&#13;
Erling Olsen, a former Speaker of the Danish Parliament, and a chief initiator to the website, the&#13;
website was established with three main objectives:&#13;

                                                                                       e-Parliaments 19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. to give more efficient information services particularly to journalists and politicians&#13;
2. to allow politicians, civil servants and the legal system to follow the process of legislation&#13;
3. to increase public transparency.&#13;
&#13;
As a result, the Danish website was largely designed for traditional users such as politicians and&#13;
journalists who have specialist software as well as existing comprehensive knowledge of the&#13;
legislative process. Although a high number of households and workplaces in Denmark are&#13;
connected to the web, the majority of the Danish population remains disengaged from the&#13;
parliamentary website because of the user-unfriendly mode of obtaining parliamentary material.&#13;
It was revealed that a high number of internet users have made use of the system, but that the&#13;
active user group is a small circle of people using it for professional purposes. Although initial&#13;
discussion did emphasize the website as a tool for enlarging democratic participation, the final&#13;
product became mainly directed to the traditional users. The website accommodates very few&#13;
possibilities for actual participation and as such it does not enhance the participatory side of&#13;
democracy in a strong way.&#13;
&#13;
This last example shows the limitations of using ICT to improve the workings of parliaments as a&#13;
contribution to democracy. Just because parliaments have improved information storage capacity&#13;
and better internal communication, it does not mean that the application of ICT improves&#13;
democratic accountability.&#13;
&#13;
Yet it is a logical first rung on a ladder of participation. Until parliaments are using e-mail and the&#13;
internet as part of their daily workings, there is little prospect that the institutions of government&#13;
will become more transparent and more accountable through the new media. Still less will the&#13;
participation of people through the democratic processes be possible using ICT if parliament&#13;
itself is not using the new technology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.3 e-government - Using ICT In New Forms of Government.&#13;
&#13;
5.3.1 CONTEXT&#13;
&#13;
The application of ICT to create a more transparent and open form of government is the most&#13;
visible and publicly accessible aspect of the application of ICT to the democratic processes.&#13;
&#13;
According to March and Olsen's work on democratic governance29, there are four ways to&#13;
understand the contribution of the parliamentary websites to democracy:&#13;
&#13;
1. access and participation;&#13;
2. adaptation to the political system;&#13;
3. the development of democratic identities and political capabilities;&#13;
4. the development of public debates.&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, a recent report outlines six stages of e-government30&#13;
&#13;
1. information publishing&#13;
2. dissemination of information&#13;

&#13;
3. official two-way transactions&#13;
4. multi-purpose portals&#13;
5. clustering of common services&#13;
6. full integration and enterprise transformation&#13;
&#13;
Most Governments now have a website presence ­ these vary from a page of information to&#13;
offering access to on-line public services. A survey undertaken in December 2000 found that&#13;
most of the responding developing countries had government websites (ranging from 70% in&#13;
Africa to 100% in the Arab States and Latin America and the Caribbean) and most (72% of the&#13;
developing countries relative to 61% of the industrialised countries) provided all on-line&#13;
government information free of charge.31 In Africa, for example, there are already quite a few&#13;
notable official general government websites, such as those of Angola, Egypt, Mauritius,&#13;
Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, Tunisia and Zambia.32&#13;
&#13;
The introduction of modern ICT in information dissemination is a major issue for all&#13;
governments. Many are seeking to replace traditional bureaucracies with more accessible and&#13;
transparent administrative systems that utilise the communication and information potential of&#13;
email and the internet.&#13;
&#13;
5.3.2 ON-LINE VOTING&#13;
&#13;
There has also been great excitement about the future of on-line voting - the use of the new&#13;
technology to enable people to vote electronically. There is a hope that this will increase voter&#13;
turnout as it will be easier for people to vote in elections. In essence this merely involves&#13;
replacing one form of voting with another. The hope is that by providing a new form of voting,&#13;
that is simpler and more in sympathy with today's lifestyle, voter turnout will be increased.&#13;
&#13;
There has been a lot of interest in the use of ICTs to facilitate on-line voting but it must be said&#13;
that this is in its infancy and there are very few concrete examples of this being implemented in a&#13;
way that materially affects voter turn-out.&#13;
&#13;
The first large-scale binding political election to be conducted online was the 2000 Arizona&#13;
Democratic primary, in which 39,942 voters cast their votes over the internet. The apparent&#13;
success of this non-public election has led to calls for e-voting to be tested in public elections.&#13;
Despite the claim that e-voting boosted turnout, fewer than half (41%) of the voters in the&#13;
Arizona primary voted online - most voted via postal ballot or at a polling station; 89.5% of&#13;
registered Democrats in Arizona did not vote - the 'success' of the ballot is based upon a 10.5%&#13;
turnout of eligible voters. Non-white, unemployed, elderly and rural Arizonans were&#13;
significantly less likely to vote online. In the UK, Bristol City Council allowed residents to vote&#13;
by phone, internet or post on the level of council tax for 2001/02. 3,063 votes (2.7%) were cast&#13;
over the internet. Croydon Council also held a similar referendum, where 2,693 votes (3.4%)&#13;
were cast over the internet33&#13;
&#13;
An interesting variation on on-line voting was the setting up of a website during recent&#13;
presidential elections in Senegal. A website was set up to enable people, both resident in Senegal&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
and those living abroad, to check their eligibility to vote. This is thought to have had some effect&#13;
on voter turnout particularly on Senegalese who were resident overseas during the election.34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.3.3 SERVICE PROVISION&#13;
&#13;
Some governments are developing new ways of engaging with people using ICT. Increasingly,&#13;
services are available on-line - resources are being made available so that people, for instance,&#13;
can fill in their tax forms on-line.35&#13;
&#13;
In the UK, for example, the Office of the e-Envoy, part of the Cabinet Office, has a responsibility&#13;
across the whole e-agenda, notably e-commerce and e-government. The e-government Group has&#13;
a clear target that all government services should be available electronically, and in a customer-&#13;
focused way, by 2005. This will mean the transformation of access to government, which will&#13;
not be focused on the needs of government departments but on the demands of consumers.&#13;
Emphasis will be on services available via the internet, although final delivery to the user will be&#13;
via the most appropriate channel.36 The internet can play an important function in providing on-&#13;
line service, particularly through schemes such as the "one-stop-shop", allowing the process of&#13;
interaction between individual and government to be made coherently without the need to pass&#13;
from one department to another.&#13;
&#13;
With more and more services available on-line, there are increasing concerns about privacy and a&#13;
need to establish a legal framework for data sharing, for example to provide a better service or to&#13;
detect fraud. People who want to use government services on-line can see the benefit of a one&#13;
stop shop or "joined up" government as service-users and as taxpayers. But joined-up government&#13;
requires joined-up information and there is often extreme public wariness of the sharing of&#13;
personal data. Technology needs to be harnessed so people can access government services in&#13;
complete confidence that information will only be used for the purposes for which it is provided.&#13;
As ICTs come to dominate some of our lives, the spectre of an authoritarian government having&#13;
access to a complete data picture of each of its individual citizens comes ever closer. Guarantees&#13;
about privacy and security of data will have to be trusted by people before they entrust&#13;
information to governments. As levels of trust in politicians is already low this will be a difficult&#13;
hurdle to clear&#13;
&#13;
Interactive service applications can save time and government expense by enabling people to&#13;
rapidly and efficiently provide information needed by government and to receive information&#13;
selectively required, through more responsive, "customer oriented" services generally more&#13;
typical of the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
Because most politically disengaged people, especially those most disadvantaged, have their main&#13;
interaction with government as consumers of public services they have a consumer focused&#13;
attitude at the moment of contact with government. This means that at this moment the efficiency&#13;
and effectiveness of government's response to their demands is of paramount importance. If the&#13;
contact is successful - in terms of clear communication, effective delivery and a coherent system -&#13;
then it is more likely to engender trust and demonstrate that government can deliver public&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
services. This would affect notions of citizenship, and perhaps lead to more active participation.&#13;
Therefore the delivery of services is crucial in developing the relationship between the excluded&#13;
and marginalised, and Government both in the developed and the developing world.&#13;
&#13;
Use of the internet by government for administrative purposes is still rare in developing countries&#13;
but there are a few interesting examples which demonstrate great possibilities for future&#13;
developments in this area. In one province in South Africa, the "one-stop-shop" model is being&#13;
introduced, with basic development information, statistics and transactions relevant to people&#13;
being made available via kiosks and terminals located in communities.37&#13;
&#13;
Indeed, use of internet kiosks has been seen as a potential way of providing access in rural areas.&#13;
But cost, security and maintenance issues, combined with the need for people to be familiar with&#13;
the technology, may limit this potential.&#13;

&#13;
"We realise that information technology is not an end in itself. It is only a means to achieve the&#13;
larger and more important goal of good governance.&#13;
&#13;
Our focus has therefore been on SMART government. SMART being the acronym for simple,&#13;
moral, accountable, responsive and transparent government. Effective use of information&#13;
technology can help achieve a high degree of accountability, responsiveness and transparency&#13;
within government. Use of information technology by removing the monopoly of government&#13;
functionaries in dispensing different services, can potentially be one of the best antidotes to&#13;
corruption. The transparency that information technology can bring can truly empower people.&#13;
People can be in a better position to hold public officials accountable if they have access to&#13;
information.&#13;
&#13;
The internet can become one of the most powerful tools in the hands of an enlightened public.&#13;
&#13;
...For example the computerisation of the Registration department has meant that a sales&#13;
registration can be completed in less than one hour as compared to more than a week earlier. We&#13;
have also integrated as part of a pilot project 19 services pertaining to six departments for being&#13;
delivered on a one-stop mode."38&#13;
&#13;
One other experiment in providing access to services through ICT is the Gyandoot project which&#13;
won the Stockholm Challenge IT Award 2000 in the Public Service and Democracy category. It&#13;
was described as "a unique government-to-citizen Intranet project ... with numerous benefits to&#13;
the region, including a people-based self-reliant sustainable strategy. 'Gyandoot' is recognised as&#13;
a breakthrough in e-government, demonstrating a paradigm shift which gives marginalised tribal&#13;
citizens their first ever chance to access knowledge, with minimum investment".&#13;

                                   The Gyandoot Project: A Case Study39&#13;
&#13;
The Dhar district in central India has a population of 1.7 million; 60% live below the poverty&#13;
line. The goal of the Gyandoot project has been to establish community-owned, technologically&#13;
innovative and sustainable information kiosks in a poverty-stricken, tribal dominated rural area&#13;
of Madhya Pradesh.&#13;
&#13;
During the design phase of the project, meetings were held with villagers to gather their input.&#13;
The Gyandoot project was launched on January 1, 2000 with the installation of a low cost rural&#13;
Intranet covering 20 village information kiosks in five Blocks of the district. Later, 11 more kiosks&#13;
were set up. The entire network of 31 kiosks covers 311 Panchayats (village committees), over&#13;
600 villages and a population of around half a million (nearly 50% of the entire district).&#13;

Amongst other services offered at the kiosks there is updated information regarding government&#13;
grants given to village committees, information regarding government programs, a forum for&#13;
school children to ask questions, and e-mail (free for information on child labour, child&#13;
marriage, illegal possession of land belonging to Scheduled Tribes, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
This information makes the functioning of government more transparent. During the first 11&#13;
months, the 31 Gyandoot kiosks were used nearly 55,000 times. Twice each day, the person&#13;
managing the server prints the complaints, applications, and e-mails that have been received and&#13;
sends them to the appropriate authority. If a complaint cannot be addressed, a reply is forwarded&#13;
to the kiosk manager. The action necessary to address the problem in the field is expected to be&#13;
taken within 7-10 days. A reply is received at the server room, which is forwarded to the kiosk&#13;
manager.&#13;
&#13;
The entire expenditure for the Gyandoot network has been borne by Panchayats and the&#13;
community with no expenditure burden for the state or national government. The network has&#13;
been set up at a total cost of Rs. 2.5 million (1 US$= roughly 50 rupees). The average cost&#13;
incurred by the village committee and the community in establishing a single kiosk was Rs.&#13;
75,000.&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural produce rates, land records and grievance services are the most popular features of&#13;
the kiosks, accounting for 95% of the usage. One clear example underscores the benefits of the&#13;
kiosks to the rural population:&#13;
&#13;
A complaint brought drinking water to a tribal hamlet of 39 households: The villagers' previous&#13;
complaint to local authorities had not yielded results for six months. To the surprise of the&#13;
villagers, their complaint filed through the kiosk brought a hand pump mechanic to the hamlet&#13;
within two days, and he repaired the hand pump within three hours.&#13;
&#13;
5.3.4 INTERACTIVE INFORMATION PROVISION&#13;
&#13;
Studies have been conducted in recent years in improving the access of information over&#13;
electronic media such as the internet. The UK Parliamentary website provides a free, easy-to-use&#13;

&#13;
way to keep abreast of legislative stages, parliamentary debate, and Committee reports. There is&#13;
no question about the amount of information now available on website.&#13;
&#13;
But the increasing use of ICT has failed to stimulate the generation of new kinds of information&#13;
resources. For instance, in the UK there is no data about individual MPs' voting patterns or their&#13;
positions on the issues of the day that would make a genuinely fresh contribution to either the&#13;
processes of representation or to the substance of accountability.         40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The German Bundestag, the supreme legislative authority in Germany, established its own&#13;
homepage on the worldwideweb in 1996. Since then, it has been argued that the internet has been&#13;
playing a significant role in closing the gap between the Bundestag and people in Germany. It can&#13;
enhance the relationship between parliament and people:&#13;
&#13;
·   by increasing public accessibility to the Bundestag,&#13;
·   by presenting information about the proceedings of the Bundestag in live multimedia form&#13;
    with pictures and networked information,&#13;
·   by broadening participation of people by providing information on the Bundestag to stimulate&#13;
    interest in further parliamentary work,&#13;
·   and by bolstering the transparency of events in parliament.&#13;
&#13;
The German Bundestag home page consists of an `information section' that contains:&#13;
&#13;
Focus                  Announcement of on-line public conferences, telephone polls and dates&#13;
                       of public events&#13;
Topical matters        Information from the Bundestag's own press service, agenda of the&#13;
                       plenary chamber etc.&#13;
Members                Information about the people's representatives.&#13;
The Bundestag          Lists of all the standing committees, committees of investigation, and&#13;
Committees             commissions of inquiry and their composition&#13;
European Affairs       Inter parliamentary relations and election data from the EU&#13;
Databases              An index of subjects and speakers, text of publications, and plenary&#13;
                       transcripts.&#13;
&#13;
The website also has an English version.&#13;
&#13;
Besides the `information section', there is the `interactive section' that allows access to live TV&#13;
coverage and the opportunity to take part in debates.&#13;
&#13;
According to Mambrey, Neumann and Sieverdingbeck the use of internet technology and in&#13;
particular its website has positively improved the awareness of the work of the Bundestag&#13;
amongst people in Germany and enabled the electorate to gain a greater understanding of how it&#13;
works. 41&#13;
&#13;
As government goes on-line there are more and more opportunities for people to gain access to&#13;
information and to interact with Government services. But it would be a mistake to see these&#13;
applications (even including the potential use of on-line voting) as the final rung in a ladder of&#13;

&#13;
harnessing the potential of ICT for the enhancement of democracy. In effect all that is happening&#13;
is making government more transparent and accessible rather than directly encouraging more&#13;
active participation in the democratic process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.4 e-democracy - The Representative Function of Parliament&#13;
&#13;
There are several well-established, mutually reinforcing phenomena which are associated with the&#13;
steady decline of parliamentary democracy. In the UK these have been identified42 as:&#13;
&#13;
     ·    The phenomenon of mass political party and the development of parties as electoral&#13;
          machines which are focussed on winning elections rather than representing their&#13;
          electorate;&#13;
     ·    The development of party discipline leading to the control of the elected representatives&#13;
          by the political executive;&#13;
     ·    The development of the mass media;&#13;
&#13;
One effect cited is the "elective dictatorship" of majority governments, linked to a growing loss&#13;
of political competence on the part of both representatives and voters. The result appears to be a&#13;
growing democratic deficit, as confidence in parliamentary institutions has eroded. This has been&#13;
reflected in falling voter participation in the electoral process.&#13;
&#13;
ICTs offer the potential for people to participate more actively in the democratic process by&#13;
permitting more involvement and contact with their representatives. The interactive nature of the&#13;
internet can serve to play a facilitating role between representatives and citizen.&#13;
&#13;
                                          The Democracy Network&#13;
&#13;
California's Center for Governmental Studies developed the Democracy Network (DNet), one of&#13;
the most innovative electronic voter guides on the internet.43 DNet's website was launched during&#13;
the summer of 1996 and offers candidate- and issue-related information, such as candidate's&#13;
issue statements, biographical data, endorsements for candidates, and details regarding ballot&#13;
initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
It also provides a forum for debate among candidates, as well as a medium for citizen-to-citizen&#13;
and citizen-to-candidate communication through live interviews on the web. The internet offered&#13;
an unprecedented opportunity to provide equal time, free from the cost and scarcity of&#13;
broadcasting. DNet targets both national and local constituencies. Users nationwide could&#13;
access information about the 1996 presidential race. In 1997, users could also obtain&#13;
information about local elections within the city of LA and plans were under way for DNet to&#13;
provide content concerning elections in NewYork City and Seattle.&#13;
&#13;
By the end of 1998, DNet was expanded to provide election information in all fifty states, with&#13;
extensive information on election issues in nine states, and it continues to expand its reach.&#13;
Within the 9 states that were a focus during 1998, nearly 100% of the major party candidates&#13;
participated on DNet.&#13;

&#13;
The application of ICT could facilitate the making of political demands and the expression of&#13;
opinions outside the set-piece rituals of elections and the channels controlled by policy networks&#13;
and parties. This will depend crucially on whether constituents are able to use ICT effectively to&#13;
hold their representatives, and through them the government, to account.&#13;
&#13;
People often feel distant from government, especially in an age where expectations are higher in&#13;
terms of openness, transparency and efficiency. ICTs and, in particular, virtual forums for debate,&#13;
can provide a platform for freedom of speech and a channel through which representatives can be&#13;
contacted, engaged with and influenced. As yet this form of e-democracy has not developed as&#13;
quickly as was predicted. People do not seem to wish to engage in on-line debate with politicians&#13;
and although e-mail is increasingly used to contact representatives this is both causing problems&#13;
of information overload and can not necessarily be assumed to be the best way of contacting&#13;
representatives.&#13;
&#13;
OMB Watch conducted a survey to all US Congressional Offices asking how they respond to e-&#13;
mail from constituents and to determine whether members take e-mail communication as&#13;
seriously as other forms of communication.44 Overall, the survey found that Congress has a&#13;
substantial and growing presence on the internet but that there has been an inadequate response to&#13;
the possibilities the internet provides for members to reach and to be responsive to the needs of&#13;
their constituents. Following are the findings from the survey:&#13;
&#13;
1. Nothing is as effective as personal communications- the form of communication that&#13;
     Congressional offices take most seriously when considering a policy position remains the&#13;
     personal letters by mail, followed by personal visits and then telephone calls;&#13;
2. For e-mail or any other form of communication to be taken seriously, it should be both&#13;
     personalized and from a constituent;&#13;
3. Members are not using e-mail to communicate with their constituents- most Congressional&#13;
     offices that receive e-mail do not respond to the letter via e-mail, instead responding via&#13;
     postal mail. Only 15% of Congressional offices used e-mail to keep up-to-date on issues that&#13;
     may be important to them;&#13;
4. Although e-mail on policy matters does not rank high today in terms of how seriously&#13;
     members take it, it is likely to have a powerful role in the future;&#13;
5. Although almost all members of Congress have websites, these sites vary greatly in quality&#13;
     and accessibility of information.&#13;
&#13;
While horizontal links between government officials and parliamentarians have been&#13;
strengthened by the process of applying ICT to parliaments, and service links between&#13;
government and people can be strengthened by on-line government, this does not necessarily&#13;
mean that ICTs will strengthen the democratic accountability of representatives.&#13;
&#13;
Walker and Akdeniz45 observe that representative democracy involves most fundamentally&#13;
accountability to an electorate, ultimately at election time. In between elections, it is vital that&#13;
public opinion can be expressed and can continue to exert an influence. They state the openness&#13;
and accessibility of channels of communication and the possibility of participation are important&#13;
attributes on which the health of a democracy in part depends.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
As people acquire ever more diverse opportunities for accessing information and expressing their&#13;
opinions, the need to use parliamentary channels may decline unless parliamentary&#13;
representatives use ICT to make themselves more representative and more accountable.&#13;
&#13;
Precious few studies have been conducted into the phenomenon of stimulating a greater level of&#13;
engagement with representatives through ICT. It does however appear to offer interesting&#13;
opportunities to buttress current democratic systems rather than serving merely to undermine the&#13;
role of representatives. The caveat is that policy makers and decision makers must ensure that&#13;
access to democratic processes does not become dependent on access to the internet and that&#13;
countries do not attempt to develop ICT-dominated system of democratic participation in advance&#13;
of widespread access. This would merely accentuate the democratic deficit rather than help to&#13;
bridge it.&#13;
&#13;
For representatives to function they need tools for effective administration, efficient&#13;
communications and comprehensive information management, both information gathering&#13;
(research) and dissemination (publishing). ICTs are a superb tool (if used correctly) to carry out&#13;
these tasks.&#13;
·   Most representatives are understandably and correctly inundated with correspondence from&#13;
    their electorate. The question is how to manage the contact and to give a quick and acceptable&#13;
    response to a communication. The use of email to fulfil this task is accelerating in countries&#13;
    with a high level of internet connectivity.&#13;
·   Representatives have to be able to access accurate information on a wide range of topics that&#13;
    may concern their electorate. The World Wide Web, government Intranets and CD-ROMs&#13;
    offer unparalleled access to the necessary quality information.&#13;
·   Representatives need to develop networks of contacts with their electorate to enable them to&#13;
    gauge opinion on issues. The creation of personal websites can be helpful by creating a focus&#13;
    for contact and communication. It can even be used to host discussion groups on particular&#13;
    issues.46&#13;
&#13;
If the representative principle of democracy is not to be undermined , representatives will have to&#13;
harness the power of ICT and be assisted in asserting their role through training and support.&#13;
Only then will e-democracy become a way of improving representative democracy and moving it&#13;
towards a more participatory form of government. If the representatives of people find themselves&#13;
sidelined by the new technology the whole basis of current democratic systems of government are&#13;
under threat.&#13;

6    On-line Democracy&#13;
     Towards a New e-Polity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So far this paper has largely analysed the potential for the internet to improve existing democratic&#13;
structures.&#13;
&#13;
It cannot be denied that ICT has already made some parliaments more efficient as places of work,&#13;
some governments more accessible and some parliamentarians more representative. However,&#13;
there are those who argue that this is not enough. They call for people to seize the opportunities&#13;
presented by the internet and email to become more actively involved in democratic processes&#13;
and to use their potential to completely reinterpret the way in which the political system operates.&#13;
&#13;
Schumpeter's analysis of the three stages of technological innovation describes that people first&#13;
use new technology to replace the old forms (e.g. sending an email instead of using the&#13;
telephone). In the second stage, people are able to use technological advances to improve the&#13;
way in which they work (e.g. by using the vast virtual library on the web to replace a trip to the&#13;
local reference library). It is only at the third stage Schumpeter believes that the full potential of&#13;
the technology is revealed when people completely transform the way in which they behave.47&#13;
&#13;
There are some who apply this model to ICT and are thus calling for a complete transformation of&#13;
democracy. This would entail the creation of a new form of e-polity in which democratic politics&#13;
will be transformed by people using the internet to articulate a strong and valid voice in how their&#13;
lives are governed.&#13;
&#13;
As a long-standing practitioner and advocate of on-line democracy Stephen Clift articulates a&#13;
strong call to transform the democratic political system:&#13;
&#13;
"I yearn for an extension of the transformative possibilities I have witnessed and directly&#13;
experienced to other citizens around the world. An on-line, engaged democratic future is too&#13;
exciting, too important to leave isolated in Minnesota where the Big Woods meets the Great&#13;
Plains in the middle of North America... People should be able to associate on-line with others in&#13;
their communities and countries to discuss issues that matter to them. Over time these interactive&#13;
citizens need to gain access to on-line tools and lessons that will help them do something about&#13;
the public problems that matter to them."48&#13;
&#13;
He relates his practical experience of helping to develop Minnesota e-democracy as a living&#13;
example of a new form of politics which enables people to use ICT to transform the way in which&#13;
they engage with the democratic process. There are many lessons which such pioneering&#13;
organisations are learning ­ learning points will need to be captured to enable other initiatives to&#13;
benefit.&#13;

6.1 On-line Democracy at the Micro Level&#13;
&#13;
A project in India demonstrates possibilities of using ICTs to improve governance at the micro&#13;
level.&#13;
&#13;
The Chief Minister of Andra Pradesh, Sri N. Chandra Babu Naidu has initiated "Micro Level&#13;
Planning for Sustainable Development of Kuppam Constituency". The Regional Centre for Urban&#13;
and Environmental Studies - Osmania University (RCUES-OU) in collaboration with the&#13;
Government of Andhra Pradesh undertook a massive household survey of the constituency and&#13;
developed a computerised database for the individuals and habitations of the constituency to help&#13;
inform future decisions.&#13;
&#13;
This project is designed to create a database of 60,000 households: a questionnaire containing 162&#13;
questions about the village's overall status, suggestions to improve the village, lack of&#13;
satisfaction, means of earning, personal details, family details, etc. was completed through&#13;
interviews. The main aim of this project was to link the database to a MPHS (Multipurpose&#13;
Household Survey) database to get the information about a particular village, habitation,&#13;
panchayat, mandal or constituency and about each and every individual present in the village.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the response given by people to the questions an analysis was made and reports were&#13;
generated to identify the villages or habitations where the government has to concentrate more&#13;
resources towards its development. Reports were also generated to show literacy rates, population&#13;
distribution, availability of schools and hospitals, and social welfare schemes adopted, which&#13;
could be used to inform decisions.&#13;
&#13;
If decisions about resource allocation can be improved at the micro level through the collection&#13;
and analysis of data and people can have more direct control over the decisions made by&#13;
politicians through the application of ICTs then political reality will be forced to change.&#13;
&#13;
6.2 On-line Democracy at the Macro Level&#13;
&#13;
At the other end of the scale, there are ways in which ICT may transform the political landscape&#13;
internationally.&#13;
&#13;
This paper concentrates mainly on state-level democratic structures but it should not be forgotten&#13;
that regional and international institutions are becoming increasingly important. Because of the&#13;
geographic distance involved it's even more important that people have ICT access to gather&#13;
information about, and to participate in, what's going on beyond the national level.&#13;
&#13;
EarthAction, a global network of citizen groups and legislators,49 has launched a new initiative to&#13;
set up an e-parliament - a forum based mainly on the internet, where the world's democratically&#13;
elected legislators will engage with civil society in a joint search for creative solutions to global&#13;
problems.&#13;
&#13;
The e-parliament will be designed to:&#13;
&#13;
·    Assist the world's 25,000 democratically elected legislators to link up through one internet&#13;
     gateway&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
49http://www.earthaction.org/e-parl/index.html&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30   Tess Kinghman&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
·   Act as a focal point for the provision of hardware, and technical capacity-building for&#13;
    parliamentarians in the developing world to go `on-line', thus helping to close a part of the&#13;
    `digital divide'.&#13;
·   Contribute to the promotion of global good governance through a `library' of examples of&#13;
    good legislation and policy deposited on the "E-parliament" site by Parliamentarians and&#13;
    available for use and adaptation by legislators world-wide.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed structure will be quite simple:&#13;
&#13;
·   Legislators can self-organise into "InterGroups" around specific issues. Each InterGroup will&#13;
    have a separate meeting space in which participants can: learn about an issue, discuss it with&#13;
    colleagues in other parliaments, draft proposals, consult with people and key stakeholders,&#13;
    and conduct polls.&#13;
·   An e-parliament Council, elected by the full membership, will ensure that each InterGroup&#13;
    has regular opportunities to bring matters to the full e-parliament in the form of an&#13;
    information bulletin; an on-line hearing (e.g. questioning the head of an international&#13;
    institution); or a poll of all members of the e-parliament.&#13;
·   Citizen groups and others will also be encouraged to form InterGroups among themselves on&#13;
    the e-parliament site, to develop proposals for the e-parliament.&#13;
·   A virtual "Parliament Building" will be created in a style resembling other parliament&#13;
    buildings.&#13;
&#13;
The very simplicity of the idea ­ to link up existing national legislators into a democratic global&#13;
body ­ is one of its strengths. At one stroke, it can take a large step towards promoting good&#13;
governance and enabling parliamentarians from developing countries to have a bigger voice in&#13;
international policy formulation with the aim of benefiting the world's poor. A few years ago a&#13;
global body of this kind would have been impossible, but the internet has changed everything.&#13;
&#13;
Although this project is yet to be launched, it does demonstrate the potential of ICTs to create a&#13;
completely new form of politics ­ an international e-polity.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                             e-Parliaments 31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7     Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
Analysts have developed a measurement, known as `e-readiness' to classify a country's status in&#13;
terms of ability to participate in the `networked' world. However, despite many studies being&#13;
undertaken (often duplicated by several researchers) it is still difficult to come to an overall&#13;
picture of the world's `e-readiness' as much of this information is not shared.&#13;
&#13;
It's clear, however, that there is a large amount of activity in industrialised countries on the&#13;
application of ICTs to democracy, but there is little practical activity in this area in developing&#13;
countries. If representative democracy is to prosper in both developing countries and the newly&#13;
emerging democracies representatives will have to be seen to hold governments to account in the&#13;
interests of those who elect them to office. The applications of ICT outlined in this paper have the&#13;
potential to do this but only with significant investment in the necessary resources and training.&#13;
&#13;
The common failure of democratic regimes in Africa can be partly ascribed to the inability of&#13;
African parliamentary democracy to generate enduring popular support or assent amongst its&#13;
citizens, with parliaments often viewed as alien, incomprehensible and distant. 50 In these&#13;
circumstances, it may seem possible that the introduction of new information and communication&#13;
technology could be used to improve the standing of parliaments in Africa and thus buttress&#13;
democracy itself. But the obstacles in the way of such an idea appear immediately&#13;
insurmountable. A study of the situation in South Africa looks at this issue in context:&#13;
&#13;
1. the current levels of ICT skills are weak and proportionate to levels of education and income;&#13;
     and even many South African MPs do not have computers in their offices. Even though&#13;
     computers are available, they would not have the skills to use the internet and e-mail.&#13;
2. access to ICT is non-existent to the majority of people in South Africa with 41% of South&#13;
     Africans still without access to electricity let alone computers.&#13;
&#13;
A third and more fundamental problem is that there are many people, due to the negative&#13;
experience prior to 1994, who still do not understand the nature of parliament. This ignorance of&#13;
parliament - coupled with widespread illiteracy, poverty, homelessness and lack of social services&#13;
- impedes participation by the majority. Thus, it is clear that the apartheid legacy significantly&#13;
undermines parliament's efforts to transform itself into a democratic institution. While access has&#13;
been relatively easy to achieve at the most basic level (by literally opening the doors to people), it&#13;
is harder to achieve equal access in terms of substantive and informed participation in the&#13;
parliamentary process itself.&#13;
&#13;
So, the ultimate question is can ICT be used to reinvigorate democracy or are the obstacles to&#13;
high to be scaled with Arnstein's ladder of participation?&#13;
&#13;
It is definitely true that ICT can be used to make parliaments more efficient (e-parliaments) to&#13;
give greater access to government services (e-government) and to make parliamentarians more&#13;
representative (e-democracy). All of these steps up the ladder are almost certainly important and&#13;
necessary for reinvigorating parliamentary democracy. This is happening around the world and as&#13;
long as the dangers of exacerbating the democratic deficit and the digital divide are adequately&#13;
addressed real progress will be achieved in these areas.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
It is also possible that the information exchange and networking possibilities may enable national&#13;
parliamentarians to work more collaboratively across national boundaries and have a greater&#13;
impact on issues of global concern by articulating local concerns. Projects that are being pursued&#13;
such as Earthaction's e-parliament appear to be a valid attempt to respond to growing concern&#13;
amongst national parliaments that issues that have global resonance, such as global warming and&#13;
the AIDs epidemic, must be addressed by national parliamentarians at a global level.&#13;
&#13;
There is however a real danger that the application of ICT to develop a new form of participative&#13;
democracy will deflect people from the task in hand - to make current forms of democracy more&#13;
transparent, accountable and representative. Incremental development (or a gradual climbing of&#13;
Arnstein's ladder) may eventually result in a new form of participative democracy. Yet an&#13;
attempt to impose such a new form of e-polity rather than assisting people in a gradual climb&#13;
towards it will be a mistake. To stretch the metaphor a little bit too far ­ people should not&#13;
attempt to reach the top of the ladder without enough rungs otherwise they may well fall off&#13;
halfway up!&#13;
&#13;
Innovative projects could be identified that attempt to help parliaments to become more&#13;
transparent, for governments to be more accountable and to enable people to hold their&#13;
representatives to account. These initiatives should be encouraged and obstacles to their success&#13;
removed. Donors should identify e-governance as a funding priority and strategies should be&#13;
adopted to ensure innovative projects are funded and learning is shared.51 Parliamentarians can&#13;
also seek to assist with the development of this new form of democracy. They can demonstrate&#13;
the possibilities by co-operating fully with any new initiatives to make them more representative&#13;
through using ICT to encourage participatory democracy.&#13;
&#13;
In the end the success of any such transformation of democracy will depend on the desire of&#13;
people to participate in building a new epolity. This desire will only be generated if people can&#13;
see a real impact on their lives by fully participating in democratic processes through ICT. Just as&#13;
parliaments can be transformed, government made more transparent and parliamentarians more&#13;
representative it is possible that democracy will become more participative using the apposite&#13;
tools provided by the internet and email.&#13;
&#13;
This is a possible future for democracy ­ people and politicians need to seize the opportunities&#13;
now to shape that future.&#13;

Arnstein's "Ladder of Citizen Participation".&#13;
&#13;
Sherry Arnstein was a public policy analyst specialising in health care provision in the USA.&#13;
Arnstein's ladder was developed in 1969 as an analysis of citizen involvement in planning&#13;
processes in the United States;52 since then it has been reprinted more that 80 times and has been&#13;
translated into several foreign languages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. Manipulation.            The aim is to manipulate the participants so that they comply with&#13;
                            imposed planning processes&#13;
2. Therapy                  The aim is to impose solutions on the participants with no involvement.&#13;
Arnstein characterises these first two rungs of the ladder as non-participation and can not be&#13;
seen as legitimate citizen involvement.&#13;
3. Informing                The first rung of citizen involvement but the emphasis is on information&#13;
                            provision.&#13;
4. Consultation             This rung may include surveys, meetings and enquiries.&#13;
5. Placation                The aim is to give the appearance of citizen involvement through&#13;
                            committees or participatory techniques as it apparently involves people&#13;
                            but the real purpose is to impose solutions.&#13;
Arnstein characterises these three rungs of the ladder as "degrees of tokenism"&#13;
6. Partnership              Power over decision making is shared between people and power&#13;
                            holders in a genuine partnership.&#13;
7. Delegated                People have delegated powers to make decisions and the public now&#13;
     power                  has the power to ensure the programme is appropriate to their needs.&#13;
8. Citizen                  People take on the entire job of planning, policy making and managing&#13;
     Control.               the programme with no intermediaries.&#13;
Arnstein characterises these highest three rungs of the ladder as "degrees of citizen power".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Although Arnstein's ladder is more directly related to citizen's involvement in the planning&#13;
process it can equally be applied to citizen participation in political processes and the degree of&#13;
empowerment. When applied to the application of ICT to democracy it is a useful tool to analyse&#13;
where on the ladder various initiatives sit and can help determine exactly how much people have&#13;
been empowered by e-parliament, e-government and e-democracy53.&#13;

Recommendations from the Third Global Forum of Naples&#13;
March 200154&#13;
&#13;
The following actions and policy options are strongly encouraged by the participants to the Third Global&#13;
Forum of Naples:&#13;
·    Multiply occasions for international best practices sharing and mutual learning on e-government&#13;
     issues;&#13;
·    E-government action plans must be built in partnership with private sector, consumers and non profit&#13;
     organisations, having specific consideration for equal opportunities and the principle of subsidiarity;&#13;
·    Special consideration must be paid to the gender divide and equal opportunities when designing e-&#13;
     government initiatives;&#13;
·    Attention must be paid to the needs of disabled and elderly people when building websites and&#13;
     projecting electronically delivered services;&#13;
·    Citizens' privacy must be considered of paramount importance and broader use made of the existing&#13;
     technologies for protecting personal data and to avoid malpractice;&#13;
·    Establish a peer-to-peer e-relationship between State and citizen, and between State and business,&#13;
     when a public service is delivered electronically, also in order to improve accountability, transparency&#13;
     and trust;&#13;
·    Redesign and not merely adjust processes when introducing ICT in government;&#13;
·    Extending the electronic delivery of public services to all the population, including the "internet ­&#13;
     illiterate" by means of, e.g., smart cards, internet kiosks ...&#13;
·    Favour the creation of websites for comparing the best examples of e-government and portals to&#13;
     provide advice and training for e-government implementation for both developed and developing&#13;
     countries;&#13;
·    Foster the setting up of international standards for technical requirements of digital documents;&#13;
·    That the OECD, taking into account the findings of the Naples Global Forum, contribute through its&#13;
     future work programme to the deepening of understanding of the potential and implications of e-&#13;
     government and sharing the results as widely as possible. Moreover, OECD could study tools for a&#13;
     high quality regulatory framework in e-government related matters;&#13;
·    That the G8 dot.force stresses, in its report, the importance of: ICT for development and for fighting&#13;
     poverty; need for specific ICT action plans for each country or group of countries; ICT policies' need&#13;
     for a strong political commitment and of partnership with private sector and NGOs; need for light but&#13;
     effective regulatory framework in order to attract investment and protect privacy of users; human&#13;
     capital enhancement, knowledge-sharing and South-South cooperation;&#13;
·    Support for UN Secretary-General action for ICT for development initiatives (UN ICT task force) and&#13;
     underline the need for coordination with other international initiatives;&#13;
·    Favouring common training initiatives for civil servants in ICTs for governments;&#13;
·    Naples seminars for developing countries on e-government, based on peer sharing and practical&#13;
     education on ICT tools, are considered a good example to be replicated; appreciation is expressed on&#13;
     the announcement that these international seminars will be repeated on an annual basis in Italy;&#13;
·    Fostering regional poles for e-government training based on strong public, private and NGOs&#13;
     partnership;&#13;
·    Fostering indigenous knowledge, local languages and preservation of local cultures by means of ICT.&#13;

            e-Parliaments : the use of information and
            communication technologies to improve parliamentary processes
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A short definition of on-line governance
            has been provided by the global survey on on-line governance
            undertaken by UNESCO and the COMNET-IT Foundation. The
            survey defined it as a resource providing citizens with
            access to computer-mediated information, service delivery or
            dialogue in liaison with government at any level. There has
            been a series of international global conferences and
            initiatives investigating the potential of e-government.
            This culminated in 2001 in the 'Third Global Forum on
            Fostering Democracy and Development Through e-government
            that took place in Naples, Italy from 15-17 March. At the
            invitation of the Italian government, more than 1 000
            representatives from 122 countries, including many
            government ministers, the multilateral agencies, the
            business community and non-governmental organizations came
            together. There was a wide ranging debate which highlighted
            the key challenges facing governments in the design and
            implementation of e-government strategies to meet the
            expectations and demands for more accessible, transparent
            and accountable government. The findings and conclusions
            reached set a challenging agenda for future work. This is
            only one conference of many and most international
            organizations, and some governments and not for profit
            organizations now have working groups or on-line information
            portals on the subject.This paper examines the progress of
            the debate on the impact of Information and Communication
            Technology [ICT] on governance and the possible future
            influence of ICT on the development of democratic systems of Government.
