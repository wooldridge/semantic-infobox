CONCLUSIONS OF THE ROUND TABLE MEETING OF CHIEF&#13;
EXECUTIVES AND POLICY MAKERS&#13;
Utility managers, policy makers and advisors, that were participating in the Abidjan workshop held a special Round Table&#13;
meeting to discuss the issues and challenges that confront them in the provision of WSS services to the poor. The Round&#13;
Table was co-chaired by Mr. Kessy Zadi of SODECI, Cote d'lvoire and Mr. Neil Macleod of Durban Metro Water Services,&#13;
South Africa.&#13;
The Round Table conclusions are summarized below beginning with the broad enabling issues followed by&#13;
recommendations on services to low-income households.&#13;
Ensuring adequate urban planning&#13;
Part of the problem in serving low-income areas is the haphazard manner in which developments in some African cities&#13;
have taken place. Governments should, therefore, place greater emphasis on planning, and define appropriate and&#13;
specific standards for low income settlements that will permit the provision of basic affordable services. Legal status,&#13;
whether permanent or temporary, should be given to informal and peri-urban settlements to enable utilities to extend&#13;
services to them.&#13;
Improving the efficiency of utilities&#13;
Utilities should strive towards greater efficiency in their operations, particularly in the area of reducing unaccounted-for-&#13;
water. Improved efficiency will allow utilities the opportunity to provide services to all customers including those in low-&#13;
income areas.&#13;
Speeding-up reform processes&#13;
A number of African governments are undertaking various reforms in the WSS sector. In most cases these have moved&#13;
slowly and expected benefits are being delayed. It is imperative that governments speed-up these reforms and ensure&#13;
that they include new policy, legal and institutional arrangements as well as incentives to enable utilities carry out their&#13;
mandate to serve the urban poor.&#13;
Training and capacity building&#13;
Manpower training should be a continuing feature of the management of utilities. African utilities should take advantage&#13;
of available opportunities for training and capacity building through both internal and external resources. Major&#13;
financing partners are ready to assist in this direction. Training and capacity-building should however not be limited to&#13;
utilities alone but also to customers and other stakeholders so that they understand the business of water and sanitation.&#13;
The problem of sanitation&#13;
Discussions on service to the poor always dwell on water supply, leaving out sanitation. However the promotion of good&#13;
health requires that serious attention is paid to sanitation. In order to create demand for sanitation services, it may&#13;
therefore be appropriate to extend subsidies for both off-site and on-site sanitation to low-income urban households.&#13;
On their part utilities should define strategic plans for providing sanitation services to the poor.&#13;
Services to low-income urban areas&#13;
The need for innovation&#13;
The technical problems associated with providing water and sanitation services to the poor are known and can be solved.&#13;
They are, therefore, not a good reason for denying water and sonitation services to low-income areas. The issue there-&#13;
fore is how utilities can develop standards and streamline their technologies so as to respond to the requirements of low-&#13;
income urban consumers. This will also require appropriate legislative and institutional support, as well as incentives&#13;
Cost recovery and subsidies&#13;
Utilities can provide sustainable services only if they can achieve some measure of cost recovery. There is convincing&#13;
evidence that the un-served poor pay relatively more per unit for the same water produced by the utility than those who&#13;
are connected. There is also clear evidence that the poor have been able and are willing to pay for WSS services&#13;
provided the necessary education and sensitization are carried out and standards are developed to suit their needs.&#13;
Serving low-income areas is therefore unlikely to compromise cost recovery. Subsidies, when availoble, should be&#13;
targeted at providing access to service connections for the urban poor.&#13;
Creating greater awareness for provision of WSS services to low-income urban areas&#13;
o  African WSS utilities should consider the establishment of dedicated units within their organizations to deal&#13;
specifically with services to low income urban communities.&#13;
o   Country level consultations among utilities and sanitation providers, policymakers and politicians should be&#13;
organized in order to create greater awareness on the provision of WSS services to the poor.&#13;
o The provision of water and sanitation services for low income areas should receive adequate treatment in country&#13;
poverty reduction strategies (PRSP) and in negotiations with development partners.&#13;

Box 6. WUP Vision for African WSS Utilities&#13;
Efficient, well-managed, accountable and responsive utilities which provide equitable, sustainable and&#13;
quality water and sanitation in their areas of operation&#13;
Sector policies and institutions providing the right incentives for utilities to:&#13;
*   Extend services to the poor through partnerships with key stakeholders&#13;
*   Foster a culture of capacity building, knowledge sharing and networking&#13;
*   Ensure a sound environment and sustainability of the water resource&#13;
The Challenge...&#13;
* 400 million urban poor by 2025 means&#13;
*   roughly 5 to 4 million new connections per year (5 to 8 inhabitants per connection)&#13;
*   6,000 to 1 0,000 connections per day on average.&#13;
Guiding Policy Principles&#13;
*   Water - focus on urban poor as customers with unique needs and demands&#13;
*   Sanitation - use water as an entry point and as a financing strategy&#13;
*   Urban - recognise unplanned or informal settlements&#13;
*   Utility - develop internal strategy and outreach capacity&#13;
*   Pricing - design around the poor, provide the necessary supports and incentives&#13;
*   Regulate - quality not price, focus on outputs not inputs&#13;
The Way Forward&#13;
&#149;   Recognize the role of utilities as leader and institutional anchor&#13;
a   Carry out institutional reforms to meet the necessary condition: i.e. an efficient and financially&#13;
sound utility&#13;
o   Draw in all stakeholders as partners under a coherent strategy&#13;
&#149;   Set clear targets, publicize commitment and build accountability&#13;
o   Foster a culture of continuous learning and exchanges within utilities, within countries and among&#13;
utilities and countries&#13;

            Building partnerships to serve the urban
            poor : summary proceedings - final workshop of WUP Project
            no. 5, Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, 19-21 November, 2001
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Utility managers, policy makers and
            advisors, that were participating in the Abidjan workshop
            held a special Round Table meeting to discuss the issues and
            challenges that confront them in the provision of WSS
            services to the poor. Some of the The Round Table
            conclusions are as follows. Part of the problem in serving
            low-income areas is the haphazard manner in which
            developments in some African cities have taken place.
            Governments should, therefore, place greater emphasis on
            planning, and define appropriate and specific standards for
            low income settlements that will permit the provision of
            basic affordable services. Legal status, whether permanent
            or temporary, should be given to informal and peri-urban
            settlements to enable utilities to extend services to them.
            Utilities should strive towards greater efficiency in their
            operations, particularly in the area of reducing
            unaccounted-for-water. Improved efficiency will allow
            utilities the opportunities to provide services to all
            customers including those in low-income areas. A number of
            African governments are undertaking various reforms in the
            WSS sector. In most cases these have moved slowly and
            expected benefits are being delayed. It is imperative that
            governments speed-up these reforms and ensure that they
            include new policy, legal and institutional arrangements as
            well as incentives to enable utilities carry out their
            mandate to serve the urban poor.
