            Bringing cellular phone service to rural
            areas : Grameen Telecom and village pay phones in Bangladesh
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Grameen Telecom has provided telephone
            access to nearly 3 million poor villages beyond the reach of
            the main phone network. The pay phone initiative has
            benefited from a number of factors: the level of demand for
            communications in rural areas; the use of the Grameen brand
            name, facilities, and in-kind support; the large number of
            Bangladeshis working abroad and wanting to call home; and
            the country's very high population density. But the
            initiative has also been held back by problems
            interconnecting with the network of the incumbent utility
            and a regulatory framework that has not yet developed the
            strength and independence to create fair rules of the game
            for all operators.
