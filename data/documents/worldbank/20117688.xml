&#13;
                                             Standard Provisions&#13;
&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Arrangements between the&#13;
Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
&#13;
1.      Administration of the Contributions&#13;
&#13;
1.1     The Bank will be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Arrangement and will not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Arrangement will be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
&#13;
1.2      Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") will be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to&#13;
finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge&#13;
that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset&#13;
control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a&#13;
Donor.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Management of the Contributions&#13;
&#13;
2.1     The funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be accounted for as a single trust fund and will be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be commingled&#13;
with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the&#13;
funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund will be held is United States Dollars (USD) (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
&#13;
2.3     Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Arrangements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank will convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;
the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor will bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;
&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;
may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion.&#13;
&#13;
2.5    The Bank will invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their disbursement&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       6&#13;
&amp;#12;administered by the Bank. The Bank will credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund to be&#13;
used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
&#13;
3.1      The Bank will deduct and retain for its own account, as a one-time deduction from the funds in the&#13;
Trust Fund, an amount equal to and not greater than thirty-five thousand United States Dollars (US$35,000)&#13;
as a set-up fee for the Trust Fund upon receipt of funds in the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
3.2     The Bank will additionally deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to five percent (5%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund&#13;
&#13;
3.3      Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;
Arrangement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right&#13;
to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Arrangements of all Donors and which would thereafter be&#13;
applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing&#13;
Administration Arrangements or from new Donors under new Administration Arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Accountinig and Financial Reporting&#13;
&#13;
4.1     The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
&#13;
4.2      The Bank will furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts, disbursements&#13;
and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the World Bank's Trust&#13;
Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all commitments and liabilities under the&#13;
Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial information relating to&#13;
receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions will be&#13;
made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
&#13;
4.3      The Bank will provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure website,&#13;
within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit report, comprising&#13;
(i) a management assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's external auditors concerning the&#13;
adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and&#13;
(ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's&#13;
opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit will be borne by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
4.4      If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank will first consult as to whether such an external&#13;
audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor will agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of&#13;
such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank will arrange for such&#13;
external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such&#13;
audit, will be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       7&#13;
&amp;#12;5.      Progress Reporting&#13;
&#13;
5.1      The Bank will provide Donors with biannual reports (in advance of six-monthly Trust Fund&#13;
Partnership Meetings) on the progress of activities financed by the Contributions. Within six (6) months of&#13;
the End Disbursement Date (as defined below), the Bank will furnish to the Donors a final report on the&#13;
activities financed by the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
5.2      Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up to six (6)&#13;
months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank will agree on the scope and conduct&#13;
of such review or evaluation, and the Bank will provide all relevant information within the limits of the&#13;
Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank,&#13;
will be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a&#13;
financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Disbursement: Cancellation: Refund&#13;
&#13;
6.1     It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by&#13;
December 31, 2018 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank will only disburse funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Arrangement (other than returns to Donors) after such&#13;
date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration&#13;
Arrangements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank will return any remaining&#13;
balance of the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective&#13;
Administration Arrangement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by&#13;
such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding&#13;
Currency amounts.&#13;
&#13;
6.2     Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel all or any&#13;
Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions (paid and not yet&#13;
paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the Bank and any consultants&#13;
and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Arrangement, prior to the receipt of such&#13;
notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank will return to the relevant Donor or Donors in the Holding&#13;
Currency in the manner specified by each such Donor in its respective Administration Arrangement the pro&#13;
rata share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the Trust Fund, in accordance with any additional terms&#13;
that may be agreed between the Bank and each such Donor.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Disclosure: Dispute Resolution&#13;
&#13;
7.1     The Bank will disclose the Administration Arrangements and related information on this Trust Fund&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into Administration&#13;
Arrangements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Arrangements and&#13;
such related information.&#13;
&#13;
7.2     The Donors and the Bank will use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute, controversy, or&#13;
claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

        the parties.&#13;
