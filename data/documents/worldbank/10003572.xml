Country-level Sector Information and Monitoring&#13;
Systems (SIMS) for Water and Sanitation in Africa&#13;
Practitioners' Workshop, Nairobi, Kenya, March 27-29, 2007&#13;
&#13;
A regional workshop on Sector Information and Monitoring Systems (SIMS) confirmed that effective SIMS are&#13;
critical to expanding and improving water and sanitation services, and enhancing the efficacy, efficiency and equity&#13;
of sector investments. The workshop articulated a framework derived from country experiences in the region,&#13;
as well as the key principles of SIMS: inclusiveness, integration with country systems and the need to adopt an&#13;
incremental approach. Development of SIMS guidelines and continued country support were identified as critical&#13;
for progress.&#13;

Summary&#13;
&#13;
A regional workshop on Sector&#13;
Information and Monitoring Systems&#13;
(SIMS) for water supply and sanitation&#13;
was held in Nairobi, Kenya in March&#13;
2007. The workshop confirmed that&#13;
effective SIMS are a critical element&#13;
of a country's efforts to expand&#13;
and improve water and sanitation&#13;
services and enhance efficacy,&#13;
efficiency and equity of sector&#13;
investments. The key principles of&#13;
SIMS agreed were: inclusiveness;&#13;
integration with country systems;&#13;
and the need to adopt an incremental&#13;
approach. The workshop also&#13;

A Strong Need for&#13;
Sector Information and&#13;
Monitoring Systems&#13;
&#13;
The country presentations as well as&#13;
the group work confirmed that effective&#13;
sector-wide monitoring and information&#13;
systems are a critical element of a&#13;
country's efforts to expand and improve&#13;
water and sanitation services and&#13;
enhance efficacy, efficiency and equity&#13;
of sector investments. Successful country&#13;
experiences presented at the workshop&#13;
also highlighted that a shared vision,&#13;
clearly articulated and laid out in a sector-&#13;
wide strategy, forms the critical backbone&#13;
for establishing an effective SIMS.&#13;

 Key Messages&#13;
&#13;
The workshop presentations and&#13;
deliberations deepened participants'&#13;
understanding of SIMS through country&#13;
experiences. The workshop also helped&#13;
to identify success factors and good&#13;
practices for the various elements of the&#13;
SIMS framework outlined above:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Resolving and harmonizing definitions&#13;
of key outcomes and intermediate&#13;
outcomes across different agencies&#13;
and donor partners is a critical&#13;
first step in establishing strategic&#13;
monitoring in a country.&#13;
&#13;
· One successful approach adopted&#13;
  by many countries is to move towards&#13;
  consultative development of a "golden&#13;
  set" of indicators (e.g. in Uganda,&#13;
  Senegal and Kenya).&#13;
&#13;
· Country experiences suggest that&#13;
  it is critical to start with existing&#13;
  information and improve definitions        countries to capture improvements in         are exploring the possibility of doing so.&#13;
  and quality of data over time. Use         quality of service across a number of&#13;
  of existing data in rigorous analysis,                                                · While in most cases implementation&#13;

        <abstracts>
            A regional workshop on sector
            information and monitoring systems (SIMS) for water supply
            and sanitation was held in Nairobi, Kenya in March 2007. The
            workshop confirmed that effective SIMS are a critical
            element of a country's efforts to expand and improve
            water and sanitation services and enhance efficacy,
            efficiency and equity of sector investments. The key
            principles of SIMS agreed were: inclusiveness; integration
            with country systems; and the need to adopt an incremental
            approach. The workshop also articulated a framework with
            five main building blocks (strategic decision-making, sector
            strategic monitoring, sector implementation monitoring,
            dissemination and institutionalization) that has been
            derived from the country experience in the region. Country
            SIMS also needs to be linked better to regional monitoring.
            Development of SIMS guidelines and continued country support
            were identified as critical for progress.
