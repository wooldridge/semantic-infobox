&#13;
OLIVER:     This is Robert Oliver about to begin a conversation with               international economic relations.       India, (at this point, there was no&#13;
&#13;
Irving Friedman--for the fifth or sixth ti.e, I guess.          I'm inquiring      division between India and Pakistan) was involved in this process of&#13;
&#13;
now about India and Irving's relation to the Bell Mission                          going to dominion status.     So under that act of about 1935 or '36,&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     I don't regard myself as having played an important role in          India, which was still under the Viceroy's council, appointed by the&#13;
&#13;
the Bell Mission.       I didn't have much to do with it except that I was         Viceroy who in turn was appointed by the Crown, was given autonomy in&#13;
&#13;
a good friend of Bernie Bell and was asked by Woods about Bernie.              I   international economic relations.       I'm talking now about '39 and '40.&#13;
&#13;
forgot what I said, but I'm       su~e   I gave him very high marks.    I had a    This was particularly important because, by this time, Britain was at&#13;
&#13;
high regard for Bernie Bell, who was someone I had met in '45 or '46.              war, so a lot of the problems that I dealt with when I was working&#13;
&#13;
During the immediate      post-wa~   period, we had done a number of things        with this government in India (I'll come to that in a moment) were&#13;
&#13;
together.     So I am   su~e   that would have been reflected in what I said       problems that arose out of the war situation.      That had a great deal&#13;
&#13;
to Woods about him.                                                                to do, as you will see in a moment, with what I did for the rest of my&#13;
&#13;
     Woods knew that I was very deeply interested in India.            I had       life.&#13;
&#13;
been involved in various things for over 20 years, and, at all times,                      I just happened to be at a conference on China.    I gave a paper&#13;
&#13;
they involved India.       That was because, when I was a graduate student         on China because my doctorate thesis was on China. Without my knowing&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                               3                                                                                       4&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
it, I seemed to have made a good impression on a new appointee called              talking clearly about '39 and '40.&#13;
&#13;
the Indian Trade Commissioner who was present at the Conference.         The            Sardar Singh Halik put together a staff. I was the only economist&#13;
&#13;
Indian Trade Commissioner reflected this new autonomy in international             on the staff.     There were a couple of other people who had come from&#13;
&#13;
economic relations.     There was s high commissioner in London, and               the British Embassy.    Malik regarded me as the only other professional&#13;
&#13;
under him a Government of India's Trade Commissioner in Australia, one             in the group.     We only had four or five people in the office, so I had&#13;
&#13;
in Tokyo, and one in New York.      If I remember correctly, the New York          a large variety of duties.&#13;
&#13;
Commissioner was in charge of all of the Western Hemisphere, although                   Among the things that I did related to the Sterling Area exchange&#13;
&#13;
it was the United States and Canada that were particularly important.              controls.     I found myself having to write memoranda or answer&#13;
&#13;
     A gentleman    na~d   Sardar Singh Kalik, a Sikh who was in the civil         inquiries from Americans and Canadians as to what these new Sterling&#13;
&#13;
service, was the first government of India Trade Commissioner. He                  Area exchange controls meant for international payments to India.          Of&#13;
&#13;
later had a very distinguished career after India became independent.              course the foreign trade from India was really quite important.       It&#13;
&#13;
He became the first ambassador of      independent India.   He was the             was in titanium ores and mica as well as jute. burlap, and cotton.             It&#13;
&#13;
Ambassador to France, and he also was their high commissioner to                   became involved with the American defense program, because the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
Canada.     He had had a incredibly distinguished career already by 1939.          had switched its sources of supply of some war materials like mica and&#13;
&#13;
He had been the head of the India wing of the Royal Air Force in World             titanium ores to India from other places, particularly Europe.     We had&#13;
&#13;
War I.    He was one of the very few recipients of the Victoria Cross.             many inquiries.     The India Supply Mission was buying war material for&#13;
&#13;
He was an internationally seeded golfer.      He was .an internationally           the India army, which was now engaged in the war.    We'd become its&#13;
&#13;
seeded tennis player.      He had won a double First at Balliol, Oxford.           support arm.    They previously had only the British Embassy as its&#13;
&#13;
Then he joined the civil service and finally became the first                      support arm.    A basic mission of our office was to report on&#13;
&#13;
Government of India's Trade Commissioner in the United States.                     developments in the United States of special importance to India.          I&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     What period of time are we talking about now?                          developed a new reporting system, which got me a special citation from&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:    We're talking about 1939-40.    Of course the office went on          the High Commissioner of the Government of India. It was an analytical&#13;
&#13;
after I left, but it was '39, '40, and '41.      The thing that I remember         report.     It wasn't just reporting daily on the price of burlap and&#13;
&#13;
is that I had already passed my oral exams at Columbia, so I was                   jute, but it talked about the needs of the United States for these&#13;
&#13;
available for a job.     The fellowship I had was expiring. So we are              different commodities and what was affecting the price of them:&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                 5                                                                                6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
different supply problems, alternative uses and alternative markets                  OSS was formed under Bill Donovan, I was asked to head up the Asian&#13;
&#13;
for different commodities like coffee from India.       I got involved in            division of the new OSS.     I've always claimed that they must have&#13;
&#13;
finding an alternative market too for their high quality coffee which                asked me because I knew the difference between Calcutta and Bombay.&#13;
&#13;
had previously gone to France.       (France was now occupied by the                 But because my knowledge was actually very limited,      I had to learn&#13;
Germans.)                                                                            about India to do the job -- even after I was regarded as an expert on&#13;
&#13;
     It was a very rich experience, and also a very rich personal                    India as well as other matters.&#13;
&#13;
experience.     Sader Singh Malik kind of adopted me as a younger                    OLIVER:     Was the embassy in Washington or New York?&#13;
&#13;
brother.    I was the only one in the office of which this was true.         I       FRIEDMAN:     The British Embassy was in Washington and the British&#13;
&#13;
had an education    co~arable   to his own.   I think I was the only                 Embassy still remained responsible for the political relations of&#13;
&#13;
university graduate on his small staff, and, of course, he was a very                India with the United States.      The new government of India Trade&#13;
&#13;
well educated person.     We got ourselves involved in many                          Commission was the only really top level office they had in New York.&#13;
&#13;
conversations.     I just had gotten married, so he would have Edna and              The office was visited by people who were involved with India like&#13;
&#13;
myself out eo dinner.     He was at this time lionized by New York                   Theodore Gregory, who was the economic advisor to the government.&#13;
&#13;
society.    He was as handsome as any Hollywood star, but at the same                When he came through the states he would stop and visit.      I got to get&#13;
&#13;
time he had great difficulty finding a place to live.        He found that           to know a number of Indians, and a number of Indians who later became&#13;
&#13;
Indians were not welcome in the United States in any high-income                     very important Pakistanis.     At this   point in time, there was no&#13;
&#13;
neighborhood, even by the people who were inviting him to dinner.                    difference.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     In the United States this was happening?                                      Malik explained to me that being a Sikh made him acceptable to&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Oh yes, in New York.   This is all New York.    I was still            Hindus and Muslims alike.     He was a major force, a mediating force, in&#13;
&#13;
registered at Columbia.     I was still finishing my doctorate degree.               India, as a friend of both Pakistan and India.     When the division&#13;
&#13;
This was very much in New York.      In those days, the number of people             came, as someone from the Punjab he was given a choice about where he&#13;
&#13;
who went abroad was very limited.      The number of Americans who had               wanted to be.     He stayed with the Government of India.   (I think he is&#13;
&#13;
been to China or India without being missionaries or something special               still alive, but he is a gentleman close to 90.)     He considered&#13;
&#13;
was very limited.     It wasn't considered at all odd that I had never               himself an Indian rather than a Pakistani.&#13;
&#13;
been to China or India.     I've since joked a lot, Bob, that when the                    It was a tremendous experience for me, acquainting me with Asia.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                             7                                                                                    8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A major reason I was hired by the U.S. Treasury was that I worked for                    In connection with Bretton Woods, there was the major question of&#13;
&#13;
the government of India.     I had done my doctorate on China, so I was          how sterling balances owned by India should be treated. These balances&#13;
&#13;
considered someone who knew about Asia.     In the State Department, I           arose from British procurement in India.      The British paid in sterling&#13;
&#13;
was welcome because I had the right kind of background.     A lot of             as was traditional for them, but this sterling was not convertible&#13;
&#13;
people in those days were becoming experts on countries about which              into other currencies.      It was so called "blocked sterling."   The&#13;
&#13;
they had little background.     I actually had considerable background on        sterling balances, like the external debt problem today, was very&#13;
&#13;
Asia as a result of the Government of India job.     I had the job for           important, and the Indians were very perturbed that these balances&#13;
&#13;
about two years.    The Government of India was a career appointment.            would not be honored.      Some English argued that India was still not&#13;
&#13;
     When I went to the Treasury, they thought of me as being expert             independent.     India's balances which had accrued during the war&#13;
&#13;
on Asia.   Among other arrangements like Japan, I worked on the                  shouldn't be a full liability of the British government.       The British&#13;
&#13;
Sterling Area.     I wrote, I think, the first memorandum in the United          were interested in some kind of settlement.        The real solution was&#13;
&#13;
States on Sterling Balances.     I was the one who proposed the treatment        sort of a fifty-fifty division, one half of the debt forgiven, one&#13;
&#13;
of Sterling Balances that came out of Bretton Woods.     I was one of the        half honored. I was the person in the Treasury who knew about India,&#13;
&#13;
few people who knew what a Sterling Balance was.     I knew the                  so the Indians (and later Pakistanis) concerned would coâ&#128;¢e calling on&#13;
&#13;
difference between different kinds of sterling.     I had had to answer          ~e.     I was a very young and relatively a junior person, but they would&#13;
&#13;
questions.about such matters.     So, during the war, I was sent out by          to talk about India.      In a way, I think if I had an influence in the&#13;
&#13;
the Treasury to the Middle East.     I used to tell people that I thought        Treasury in foreign affairs, it was on India more than on anything&#13;
&#13;
I was sent to the Middle East because I didn't think anybody in the              else.&#13;
&#13;
Tressury understood that there was a distinction between the Middle              OLIVER:     Tell about your experiences after the war, including the&#13;
&#13;
East and the Orient.    I knew sometbin&amp; about that psrt of the world.           International Monetary Fund.&#13;
&#13;
When I was then sent to China, my mission was to China    ~   India.     1       FRIEDMAN:     Well I went to the International Monetary Fund not long&#13;
&#13;
was asked to go to India, for example, to negotiate the payment of               afterwards.     (We're talking now '44, '45, and '46.)    The Fund was&#13;
&#13;
troop pay for U.S. troops in India.    We obtained the needed rupee              really an   econo~ics   department at that time.   Eddie Bernstein was the&#13;
&#13;
currencies by gold sales in India.    That was what the government of            assistant director and acting director of the Research Department.          It&#13;
&#13;
India preferred.                                                                 was immediately set up on a geographic basis.       I was made the acting&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                          10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
head of the Asian division as well as the head of the US division.          friends even after going back to India.&#13;
&#13;
Also the acting head of the Middle East division.     In the case of the            Executive Directors from Pakistan and India thought of me as an&#13;
&#13;
Asian division, I don't remember how long it lasted.     It may have been   old Indian hand.     They included highly placed Indians like Joshi,&#13;
&#13;
nearly a year before they got an Indian to come and be the head of it.      Anjeria and B. K. Nehru.    They thought of me as someone who had once&#13;
&#13;
In the case of the Middle Eastern division, it was more than a year         worked for the Government of India.    They were very senior and I had&#13;
&#13;
until a man named El Gutly came to be its head.     I remained very close   been of low rank, but we had both worked for the government of India.&#13;
&#13;
to the people in the Middle East and Asia.     Some of the more junior      This was true with the Pakistanis as well as the Indians.     This was&#13;
&#13;
people who were under me when I was acting division chief remained on       the origin of my friendship with Mohamed Shoaib, who later became&#13;

the staff.     I was always deeply involved in the Fund work on India and   Pakistan's Minister of Finance.&#13;
remained so until I went to the World Bank--even though my                          My background had a great deal to do with the kind of assignments&#13;
responsibilities were not defined as India,                                 I got in the Fund.     In the Fund, one of the argumentsÂ· in support of&#13;
&#13;
        When I got to the World Bank, I told Woods about my background      my becoming a department director of the new Exchan&amp;e Restrictions&#13;
&#13;
including my interest in India.     I found that he, himself, had a very    Department was that I was the only economist in the Fund who knew      wha~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
deep interest in India.     He was very concerned about India and had       an exchange restriction was.     It was true; I actually knew what an&#13;
&#13;
very decided views on development in India, particularly on things in       exchange race system was.     I was able from the beginning to be&#13;
&#13;
which he had been involved -- like fertilizer plants.     This was all a    concerned with things like the required Annual Report on Exchange&#13;
&#13;
prelude to the Bell Mission.     When I look back on it, had I not had so   Restrictions of all member countries as well as the issues in the Fund&#13;
&#13;
much confidence in Bernie Bell, I might have tried to involve myself,       around Article VIII and Article XIV, for the distinction was between&#13;
&#13;
but I didn't because I had a high regard for Bernie Bell.     I had other   restrictions on current payments or on capital.    This distinction was&#13;
&#13;
things to do.     But I always remained very interested in what he was      very deeply ingrained in the exchange control laws of the Sterling&#13;
&#13;
doing and in other Indian matters.     From time to time, when we had       Area.     Â£ven in the balance of payments work in the Fund, I was always&#13;
&#13;
visiting dignitaries from India like the Minister of Finance, the           looked to as someone who was particularly familiar, which I was, with&#13;
&#13;
Governor of the Reserve Bank, and so forth,     I was usually involved.     British balance-of-payuents statistics.     So, in addition to whatever&#13;
&#13;
Indian and Pakistan personnel in the Bank worked with me in those           else I was doing, I never did stop being an informal expert on India,&#13;
&#13;
days.      In Pakistan, Indian staff and representatives remained close     and that goes on to this day.&#13;

OLIVER:     Who were some of the important people that you knew?       Did             of one of the staff members, Das Gupta, an eminent professor in India.&#13;

they include the person who came to be called TTK?                                     I. G. married his daughter. They spent their honeymoon with us in&#13;
&#13;
FRIEDMAN:     Yes, it included TTK.    It also included Deshmuk who had                Maine.   They wanted to avoid the embarrassment of being taken for&#13;
&#13;
become the revered governor of the central bank.         He was the first              Black on a honeymoon.    These were examples of the intimate&#13;

Indian Governor of the Reserve Bank of India whom I met first when I                   relationships with Indians and Pakistanis and in the Fund.&#13;

time.     All of them that I met were involved in some way or another                  All of them thought of me as someone very interested in India, and&#13;
&#13;
with the Indian Nationalist Movement.       They were members of the                   that remained as long as 1 was in the Fund.     I. G. Patel was a&#13;
&#13;
Congress Party, and had come visiting the United States in order to                    brilliant young and personable economist.     He did extremely well in&#13;
&#13;
exercise some influence on the U.S. Treasury's attitude toward India,                  the Fund.     The chief of the Asian division was Chinese. The deputy&#13;
&#13;
or the Monetary Fund's attitude toward India.                                          chief was Anjarea,    They became very good friends.   Anjarea   was a&#13;

        Compared to these other people, I. F. Patel was a late comer.        He        great admirer of I. T. Patel.    Anjarea came back to the Fund in later&#13;
&#13;
came to work in the research department of the Fund.         He came from              years as Executive Director for India.     He and I became quite friendly&#13;
&#13;
Cambridge.     We got to know him very well.      He became a roommate of Bob          and had frequent exchanges of views.&#13;
&#13;
DeVries whom you know.      (We at this time were very friendly with Bob                    He was brought back to India in the early 1950s     to be chief&#13;
&#13;
DeVries.     He was engaged to Margaret Garrittsen, who was very close to              drafter of India's first five year plan.     It was under the Prime&#13;

us.)    He had some rather nasty   e~periences,   being taken for Black in             Minister Nehru.    He was quite well liked by Nehru.   They knew each&#13;
&#13;
Washington.    We were helpful in softening those.      Bob DeVries was very           other well.    Anjarea sent me the first draft of the Indian Five Year&#13;
&#13;
helpful.     I. G. Patel married a girl that we knew.     She was a daughter           plan for my personal comments, not in my Fund capacity.&#13;

&#13;
        Anjarea was one of the few persons I consulted when Woods asked                     was around 1955-7,     What about other Asian countries like the&#13;

me to come to the Bank in 1964,       Have 1 told you this story?   It                      Philippines.     Were you involved?&#13;
&#13;
illustrates a lot,     Anjarea was the Indian Executive Director.        We                 FRIEDMAN:     When I came back from the Far East and Asia at the end of&#13;

vision.    His vision was terrible.    When he wanted to read anything, he                  about the Philippine Independence Act and relations with the&#13;
&#13;
would bend over to where his eyes were only a few inches from the                           International Monetary Fund. I had just come from the Far East, and I&#13;
&#13;
surface of the table or desk to read,       l told him about this offer.           1        was very impressed with the stories I had heard about the bombing of&#13;
&#13;
expressed certain qualms. I was leaving the Fund where he thought I                         the Philippines by the Japanese and by ourselves.     It was at this&#13;
&#13;
was a good influence and going to the'Bank.        I told him, "Well, you                   point, we were liberating the Philippines.     I inquired in the Treasury&#13;
&#13;
know, if I go to this job, I'll be able to bring about closer                               what was being done with respect to the post-war Philippines. I was&#13;
&#13;
relations between the Fund and the Bank."       He bent his head as if he                   told by Treasury people that, as far as they were concerned, nothing&#13;
&#13;
were reading something way down near to the table, his nose nearly                          was being done.     I was told by Treasury in its typical way.     If I&#13;
&#13;
rubbing the table.     He shook his head dolefully and said, "The one                       wanted to do something about the Philippines, go ahead and see what&#13;
&#13;
thing you don't want to have is cooperation between the Fund and the                        could be done.     I was told to get in touch with Abe Fortas, who was&#13;
&#13;
Bank,     We in India can only survive because the Fund and the Bank          Â£2            the Undersecretary of the Interior in charge, among other things, of&#13;
&#13;
not coopergte with each other."       I didn't know what he meant until I                   the Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
went to the Bank and saw the differences between the two institutions.                      OLIVER:     This was clearly before the International Monetary Fund&#13;
                                                                                            days.&#13;
I came to understand what it meant to an Indian able to walk from one&#13;
&#13;
building to the other to try to get support for a proposal which the                        FRIEDMAN:     Yes. One of the reasons why I could take this initiative&#13;
&#13;
other institution thought was impossible,                                                   was because,     during 1942 and 1943, I had gotten to know the Secretary&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     It is probable that Alan Sproul was associated with the                         of Finance of the Philippines, a Mr. Hernandez, who got stranded in&#13;

&#13;
which had already been in existence, was around 1960.       It is likely                    division assigned, among other duties, to the Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
that the iron and steel industry, which was a project of the Birlas,                                I went to speak to Secretary Fortas with the permission of the&#13;

&#13;
     There was a long list of limitations on Philippine Independence             support for the new Philippine government. Cuaderno became Governor of&#13;

in the Philippines Independence Act in the field of international                the Central Bank.       They all thought of me as someone in the US&#13;
&#13;
economics and national trade.   I was quite concerned that we were               Treasury,    ~ho   was trying to get help for the Philippines.    I   ~as   still&#13;
&#13;
giving this country independence, and yet we were to have all these              in my 20s at the time.       We were able to develop a fairly ambitious&#13;
&#13;
constraints on the new Philippine government after it became                     program for the Philippines.       In fact, as I look back at it now, I am&#13;
&#13;
independent.   I suggested changes and we rewrote the law.   Instead of          incredulous at how generous we were with the Philippines.         Any&#13;
&#13;
having all these different provisions, there would be reference to the           decision that we could make that would increase the foreign exchange&#13;

fact that the Philippines would be a member of the International                 income of the Philippines was made that way.&#13;

incurring as members of the International Monetary Fund.                         obligations that were incurred by the Philippine guerrillas who fought&#13;
&#13;
     At that time, the two key issues were the trade issue, because we           against the Japanese?       Should they be fully honored?   We decided they&#13;
&#13;
were giving preferences to the Philippines, and the exchange rate                should be fully honoured.       We even decided to fully honour obligations&#13;
&#13;
issue because the peso had been tied to the dollar.   I was able to get          that were written on the sacks of paper bags, paper sacks, where some&#13;
&#13;
this amended. It became part of the new law, the present law. I was              guerrilla officer would authorize us to give to a village some food or&#13;

&#13;
found myself in charge of the financial aspects of the Philippines               really incredible, but there was no opposition whatever.         This was not&#13;
&#13;
post-war aid program. Anything we did required future Congressional              a question of fighting anybody.       Everybody wanted to be generous to&#13;

action. A guy named Frank Waring was the person who later became     ~&#13;
&#13;
ma1or domo on the Philippine program. He was a very intelligent.     Uhen        imagination and ingenuity in figuring out how to give more to the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 Philippines in those days.&#13;
we developed the program, he got a full-time job of administering it,&#13;
                                                                                 OLIVER:     Has this stood the test of time?&#13;
as 1 recollect it.&#13;
                                                                                 FRIEDMAN:     Yes.    I feel that one of my lessons from the Philippine&#13;
     For a number of months, I chaired this committee on the&#13;
&#13;
Philippine aid program.   I got to know all the Filippinos, including            experience was that che Bank ought to engage in policy- based lending.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                 17                                                                                18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It ought to move away from project lending and really try to take a                   either to belittle it in terms of importance or to get the people who&#13;
&#13;
responsible role for helping countries formulate and execute a social                 were good at it involved in non-research policy-making decisions. Both&#13;
&#13;
and economic development program that was in the best interest of the                 were destructive of the other. The people who were doing research&#13;

country.                                                                              really should want to do research and    DQ1   be working on day-to-day&#13;
&#13;
        A second lesson affected the role of economists in the World                  policy.&#13;
&#13;
Bank.       I believe economists should become part of the decision-making            OLIVER:     Kay I just interject to say that I agree with you -- whole&#13;
&#13;
process.      Rather than thinking of economists as doing isolated,                   heartedly in the esse of the second.     I have some doubts about the&#13;
&#13;
separated jobs (whether on commodities or on balance of payments or on                first, but we'll talk about that in a moment.&#13;
                                            ' '                                       FRIEDMAN:     The third one is that the mature role of the Bank as&#13;
the beginnings of external debt, for example, or even            training like&#13;
&#13;
the Economic Development Institute), all of which are worthwhile,                     against its initiating role is to defend development -- and that means&#13;
&#13;
economists as a profession were, I found, not really part of the                      that we would try to get through that the Supplementary Finance&#13;
&#13;
decision making process of the Rank.          They were people   on the               Proposal, There is no institution in the world today that really has&#13;

&#13;
had DQ1 had as much success in that as I would of liked.            It is a           whose role it is to originate development whether it is agriculture,&#13;
&#13;
conviction that has stood the test of time.                                           or food, or energy, or environment.     the idea   however    is that once&#13;
&#13;
        I   wo~l~   have hoped in the years to come that economists would             you haye a development Program in place the developing countries are&#13;
&#13;
have played more of a role, but          it would DQ1 be in a field of                particularly yulner&amp;ble to adversities in the world economy and need&#13;
&#13;
academic research. I had the feeling that we ought to be supportive of                from time to time outside help from an institution ;hat sees to i;&#13;
&#13;
academic research where it was taking place.          We ought to be pleased          tba; ;he development program is carried on even in difficul; periods&#13;
&#13;

            transcripts exist as a seven volume set, consisting of one
