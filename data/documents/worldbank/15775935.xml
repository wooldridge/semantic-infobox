         The merits of South-South exchanges&#13;

To develop an efficient knowledge                     On the demand side in the knowledge&#13;
exchange, knowledge seekers must be               seeking country, programs must target and&#13;

    A key challenge in the knowledge              the minister-level executive director of the&#13;

     knowledge exchange program responds to the articulated needs of the partner country.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Identify key change agents on both sides of the knowledge exchange to ensure those who have firsthand&#13;
     experience of the reform process are providing knowledge and support to those who are able to mobilize&#13;
     resources and drive targeted changes toward reform.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Build sustainable momentum for change by encouraging and managing recurrent horizontal (cross-country)&#13;
     and vertical (within-country) interactions, as well as by using knowledge exchange instruments that motivate or&#13;
     inspire, such as twinning arrangements or site visits.&#13;

  â&#128;¢ Trace the change logic to illuminate the results story of how knowledge exchange leads to intermediate&#13;
     outcomes that contribute to institutional changes that affect the development goal.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Assign indicators to monitor and measure change that will help practitioners to track progress, document&#13;
     practical lessons in implementation, and make timely adjustments to the program when necessitated.&#13;

     measures and failure to effectively track&#13;
     them limit the possibility to make needed,&#13;

Overview                                        Korea has provided policy consultations&#13;
Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s development cooperation effort          to 22 countries on topics ranging&#13;
took off when the government of Korea           from development planning to crisis&#13;
launched the International Development          management (list available at http://www.&#13;

sequently, the Economic Development             Korea is working with 26 countries on a&#13;

and microscopic policy approach to aid          its embassies and crafts its consultation&#13;
and development lacked coordination and         projects tailored to the needs of these&#13;
did not fully take into consideration the       countries. Former high-ranking govern-&#13;
socioeconomic environments and policy           ment officials are directly involved in these&#13;
demands of its partner countries (Lim           policy consultations to share their intimate&#13;

of three parts: (1) the systemization and       one-size-fits-all or template approach, this&#13;
modularization of Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s development           knowledge-sharing exercise is customized&#13;

     edge-intensive development cooperation             and capacity building. The KSP selects its&#13;
     projects can be categorized into three             participants by matching experts and policy&#13;
     groups: technical assistance/cooperation,          practitioners of a partner country with their&#13;
     study tours, and policy dialogues. In many         respective Korean counterparts. This facili-&#13;
     cases of technical assistance, experts are         tates close collaboration through active dia-&#13;
     sent to a partner country and conduct stud-        logues and research work conducted both&#13;
     ies in the field, after which recommenda-          in Korea and its partner countries, where&#13;
     tions are drawn to complete the project.           the final policy recommendations are co-&#13;
     The set of policy recommendations is then          authored by the collaborators of both coun-&#13;
     submitted to the government of the part-           tries. Therefore, the process is geared to&#13;
     ner country. However, this mode of craft-          enhance the likelihood that recommenda-&#13;
     ing and delivering recommendations has             tions are implemented because the actual&#13;
     drawbacks in that it is limited in fostering       policymakers and their experts are highly&#13;
     ownership within the partner government            involved in making the recommendations.&#13;
     as well as in building capacity to convert         This is particularly relevant when the KSP is&#13;
     these recommendations into actionable              in a partner country that is supported with&#13;
     policies. Once foreign experts leave, often        financial assistance from Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s EDCF or&#13;
     all that is left behind is a consultation report   grants to assist in implementing develop-&#13;
     (Lim 2011b).                                       ment strategies that were recommended.&#13;
         In the case of study tours, policy practi-         In addition, the KSP plans study tours&#13;

     different perspectives from what they are          mid- and long-term working relationships&#13;

     the participants take specific actions to          tries and of the organizations that they visit&#13;
     change after returning home, study tours           to produce practical outcomes in institution&#13;

     long time for the law to be implemented.           Likewise, a team of policymakers would visit&#13;
     This wait is often due to a lack of common         the Korea Institute of Science and Technol-&#13;
     understanding among the relevant stake-            ogy and the Daeduk Innopolis, a cluster of&#13;

     interaction among key stakeholders.                opment centers, and venture companies,&#13;
         Bilateral and multilateral dialogues allow     to demonstrate the importance of institu-&#13;
     policymakers to have in-depth discus-              tion and capacity building. These kinds of&#13;
     sions and to build networks, but the actual        activities are possible and relatively man-&#13;
     outcome of these changes is still left as          ageable to carry out under the KSP since&#13;
     mid- and long-term tasks. Also, if key             participants are current policy practitioners&#13;
     policymakers do not guarantee continued            and experts from Korea and its partner&#13;
     interest and participation, such an in-depth       countries.&#13;

&amp;#12;  Key Activities of Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s Knowledge Sharing Program&#13;
  â&#128;¢ For Policy Research, the KSP teams identify, analyze and conduct research on current policy issues of a partner&#13;
     country, where case studies are reviewed and workshops organized to discuss the preliminary results and get&#13;
     feedback from policy practitioners and experts.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ For Policy Consultation, the KSP teams discuss the current development issues and policy alternatives with top&#13;
     policymakers and heads of relevant organizations from a partner country. This is to ascertain the needs of partner&#13;
     countries; to share Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s development experience; and to enhance the applicability of the research outcomes&#13;
     as actual development policies.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ For Capacity Building, the KSP teams invite policy practitioners and experts from a partner country to Korea&#13;
     to discuss the research outcome, take part in a series of seminars on Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s development experience, and visit&#13;
     relevant Korean institutions to build institutional and personal networks.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ For Dissemination, a workshop is held both in the partner country and Korea in which policy outcomes and the&#13;
     experiences of the KSP are disseminated to policy practitioners, experts, academia, the private sector, and the&#13;
     general public.&#13;

     diate capacity outcomes (ICOs) that change      involve, for example, improved processes&#13;
     agents can achieve to contribute to institu-    for collaboration, stronger incentives for&#13;
     tional level changes (Table 2). An ICO is an    participation in the network, or increased&#13;
     improvement in the ability or disposition       traffic or communication among network&#13;
     of agents to take actions. This improve-        members.&#13;

     the expectation is that stakeholders or         which is a strengthened disposition or&#13;

         The CDRF specifies six types of ICOs.           ICOs reflect the initial change results&#13;
         (1) Raised awareness, which is an           of capacity development interventions&#13;
     increased disposition to act, through,          and are determined by the needs of local&#13;

out and defining each agentâ&#128;&#153;s role in the&#13;
envisioned change; and setting milestones&#13;
against which knowledge partners can&#13;
monitor progress toward achieving capacity&#13;
development objectives.&#13;
     Once the targeted ICOs are identified,&#13;
it is necessary to trace the change process&#13;
intended to strengthen the identified&#13;
institutional capacity characteristics. The&#13;
program change process logic can be&#13;
explored by asking the following questions:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Who were the change agents who&#13;
     initiated or managed the desired&#13;
     change process(es)?&#13;
â&#128;¢ What ICOs achieved by selected agents&#13;
     empowered the process of change, and&#13;
     led to the measurable improvements in&#13;
     institutional capacity characteristics?&#13;
â&#128;¢ What capacity development&#13;
     interventions contributed to the&#13;
     targeted ICOs?&#13;
&#13;
   Thus, to identify the results of knowl-&#13;
edge exchange programs, the primary&#13;
step is to trace the program logic and&#13;
associated measures to explore the cause-&#13;
and-effect relationships between knowl-&#13;
edge exchange program activities and&#13;
outcomes. Once this basic understanding is&#13;
established, it is necessary to explore how&#13;
the program was implemented and what&#13;
discrepancies exist between expected and&#13;
actual outcomes.&#13;

Conduct additional interviews of key&#13;
informants&#13;
As possible, collect qualitative data from&#13;
other program designers, knowledge pro-&#13;
viders, participants, and other stakeholders&#13;
well positioned to provide useful contex-&#13;
tual information or evidence of outcomes.&#13;
This step could include field visits and in-&#13;
person interviews (Dominican Republic and&#13;
Mongolia examples) or could be limited to&#13;
email exchanges and telephone interviews&#13;
(NESAP example).&#13;
&#13;
Follow up as needed to collect&#13;
evidence from key informants&#13;
Continue to develop and refine the results&#13;
stories through an iterative process, con-&#13;
structing a more detailed description of the&#13;
relevant change process(es) and requesting&#13;
additional clarification and evidence when&#13;
possible.&#13;
&#13;
    Simple, consistent qualitative data&#13;
collection techniques work effectively for&#13;
revealing and compiling the evidence of&#13;
results from knowledge exchange pro-&#13;
grams. Applying the CDRF to identify and&#13;
analyze intermediate and institutional&#13;
outcomes through these steps provides a&#13;
detailed understanding of how knowledge&#13;

                                                                                                                   49&#13;
&amp;#12;     and skills in their countries. This request&#13;
     occurs because most knowledge seeking&#13;
     countries lack capacity in the actual pro-&#13;
     cess of implementing new strategies. For&#13;
     example, in the Dominican Republic, the&#13;
     first KSPâ&#128;&#153;s recommendation to establish&#13;
     an export-import bank was accepted by&#13;
     the Dominican government; however, the&#13;
     Dominican stakeholders lacked the know-&#13;
     how and experience to readily implement&#13;
     it. Thus, a follow-up KSP was requested and&#13;
     implemented on how to manage and oper-&#13;
     ate export financing and insurance services&#13;
     for an export-import bank.&#13;
         Knowledge exchange programs,&#13;
     therefore, must not stop at providing&#13;
     knowledge content but also have a&#13;
     follow-up mechanism to monitor and assist&#13;
     how knowledge exchange outcomes are&#13;
     applied in the partner country. In addition,&#13;
     knowledge exchange programs should&#13;
     be linked to other technical assistance&#13;
     programs or loan programs needed by the&#13;
     partner country to implement recommend&#13;
     projects.&#13;
         For the Dominican Republic, the KSP&#13;
     played a bridging role, linking Koreaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     EDCF to financing export infrastructure&#13;
     development projects such as the estab-&#13;
     lishment of the CIBAO Trade Center.&#13;
     KEXIM and BNVP have further developed&#13;
     its partnership in the third (2010) and fourth&#13;
     (2011) KSPs, which are currently building&#13;
     the capacity of BNVP staff in export financ-&#13;
     ing and insurance services. In addition,&#13;
     through KSP, CDEEE and KEPCO were able&#13;
     to sign a memorandum of understanding to&#13;
     change old power distribution lines of 400&#13;
     km in three cities. KEPCO is also providing&#13;
     training programs and staff exchanges with&#13;
     CDEEE to build the capacity of the Domini-&#13;
     can participants to improve efficiency in the&#13;
     electric power sector.&#13;
         In results-focused capacity develop-&#13;
     ment, knowledge exchange programs&#13;
     must be structured to continue to affect&#13;
     institutional outcomes. Programs should&#13;
     not stop at the ICO level but continue to&#13;
     have follow-up programs or links to other&#13;
     technical assistance programs that can help&#13;
     achieve targeted institutional outcomes.&#13;

One	of	the	most	important	and	fundamen-          had talked about different things about&#13;

    Over the course of the program, the          resulted in a long list of PPP project candi-&#13;
knowledge participants constantly pin-           dates lying on the shelf. However, after the&#13;
pointed the lack of a legal framework as the     KSP, the line ministries now understand bet-&#13;
main barrier to properly exercising PPP in       ter the criteria for identifying potential PPP&#13;
Mongolia. The two workshops mentioned            projects and are able to propose projects&#13;
deficiencies in the various stages of a PPP      that are more appropriate and precise.&#13;

for a project, unclear procedures for the        Nansanjargal, officer of the PPP depart-&#13;

lacked guidelines to handle and oversee          to provide input on the projects from an&#13;
PPP, which could lead to many risks such         economic perspective.&#13;

                       Designing the Program to Provide                  are in the position to understand, learn and&#13;

                       crucial the knowledge participants learn             For instance, government officials who&#13;
                       in seminars and workshops but are also            have interest in the program topics are to&#13;
                       exposed to real-world examples. The cases         participate in the program, so that they are&#13;
                       play a visionary role to motivate participants    enthusiastic and are more willing to take&#13;
                       working toward a goal.                            part compared to officials who have no&#13;
                                                                         relation to the issues. This includes officials&#13;
&#13;
70&#13;
&amp;#12;who work in related fields and are in the&#13;
right position to use the knowledge gained&#13;
from the program when doing their job.&#13;
    In the case of Mongolia, the KSP partici-&#13;
pants were appropriate for the three topics&#13;
covered. Understanding the local environ-&#13;
ment, including the organization in charge&#13;
and the organizational structure, helps to&#13;
ensure that participants are relevant. In the&#13;
case of PPP, the SPC was the main body&#13;
in charge, so the majority of participants&#13;
for PPP were from SPC, specifically under&#13;
the PPP division. For PFS, NDIC and the&#13;
Ministry of Finance were the key agencies&#13;
involved. Under the Ministry of Finance, the&#13;
fiscal policy department mostly dealt with&#13;
the PFS, so the program coordinator and&#13;
local consultant for the PFS were selected&#13;
from that department to ensure relevancy.&#13;
Regarding deposit insurance, working-level&#13;
officials from the Bank of Mongolia, Min-&#13;
istry of Finance, and FRC were invited to&#13;
participate because they were all equally&#13;
concerned with the issue and highly likely&#13;
to benefit from the KSP.&#13;
    Another important factor is to not only&#13;
have the participants who are at the work-&#13;
ing level report to the higher ranks and&#13;
voice their opinions based on the knowl-&#13;
edge gained, but also those who have the&#13;
authority to make the final decisions. This&#13;
was one of the main reasons why the local&#13;
consultant for the PPP was the head of the&#13;
PPP division who had the power within the&#13;
division in selecting PPP projects. If only the&#13;
working-level officers participated in the&#13;
program, they may have had difficulty in&#13;
exercising PPP as learned from the KSP. The&#13;
KSP thus selected participants to ensure&#13;
efficiency and boost cooperation within&#13;
the same department. For PPP, a member&#13;
of the cabinet also participated in the KSP&#13;
because PPP project selection procedure&#13;
involved getting approval from the cabinet.&#13;
The interviewees reported that including&#13;
the cabinet member in the KSP enhanced&#13;
cabinet membersâ&#128;&#153; understanding on PPP&#13;
so that PPP projects could be carried out in&#13;
a more efficient manner.&#13;

Instead, a knowledge exchange should ide-&#13;
ally be embedded in, or linked to, a larger&#13;
related capacity development intervention&#13;
or an integrated set of ongoing activities.&#13;
The experience of Ghana was particularly&#13;
instructive for this lesson, with the Ghana&#13;

ticipants could promote the changes they&#13;
wanted to see happen.&#13;

    provide the opportunity to achieve or&#13;
    work toward ICOs as part of a longer&#13;
    capacity development change process.&#13;
    One participant from Nigeria articulated&#13;
    this lesson clearly by pointing out that&#13;
    the success of the learning visit to India&#13;
    was inappropriately assessed by the&#13;
    degree to which all of the steps of the&#13;
    delegationâ&#128;&#153;s action plan were imple-&#13;
    mented. Given that these steps involved&#13;
    a longer-term process and the ongoing&#13;
    infusion of additional resources, this&#13;
    assessment did not provide an accurate&#13;
    or fair measure.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Facilitate	action	planning	and	ensure	&#13;
    that	needed	resources	are	available.	&#13;
    Directly related to the previous point,&#13;
    any action planning that occurs during&#13;
    a South-South experience exchange&#13;
    with similar format and duration should&#13;
    be guided and monitored so that par-&#13;
    ticipants establish realistic objectives&#13;
    and timelines that rely on available&#13;
    resources. Inspiration established within&#13;
    a delegation after a learning visit could&#13;
    otherwise quickly dwindle by repeated&#13;
    attempts to locate additional funding or&#13;
    other necessary support.&#13;

Sample Interview Questions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Instructions&#13;
The interviews are most effective when conducted with two people on the interview team.&#13;
One person leads the discussion asking questions from the respondent, and the other&#13;
person focuses on taking notes, while also potentially jumping in to ask follow-up or&#13;
clarification questions. It is helpful to record the session to document the results. Videos&#13;
could provide interesting testimonial evidence as well. However, the quotes could also be&#13;
transcribed and reported as a narrative.&#13;
&#13;
Protocol&#13;
The interviewer greets the respondent and gives a brief background to explain that the&#13;
purpose is to explore outcomes from the knowledge exchange. The interviewer may segue&#13;
into the questions with a statement such as, â&#128;&#156;Since the knowledge exchange ended, we&#13;
would like to follow up on what happened with the activities that were planned based on&#13;
the policy recommendations.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   notes to the Interviewer&#13;
   â&#128;¢ The interview guide does not need to be followed in sequence; instead, a&#13;
     collaborative, conversational approach could dictate the order in which topics are&#13;
     addressed.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Probes and instructions are provided in italics to assist the interviewer in eliciting&#13;
     more details as needed.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ The interviewer should use this guide to qualitatively explore the capacity&#13;
     development change process(es) supported by the knowledge exchange program.&#13;
     Existing challenges and reported outcomes should be translated into the CDRF&#13;

&amp;#12;      The demand for practitioner knowledge and customized learning&#13;
      is now at the forefront of the development agenda, leading to a&#13;
      proliferation of South-South knowledge exchange programs.&#13;
&#13;
      In this joint study, the Korea Development Institute and World&#13;
      Bank Institute assess the impact of three knowledge exchange&#13;
      programs on capacity development. Using a results-focused&#13;
      methodology, the study reveals concrete evidence of institutional&#13;
      and intermediate outcomes from knowledge exchange. The study&#13;
      also shows the importance of country ownership and sustained&#13;
      cross-country and within-country interactions in facilitating tacit&#13;
      knowledge exchange and building momentum for change.&#13;

            Using knowledge exchange for capacity
            development : what works in global practice? Three case
            studies in assessment of knowledge exchange programs using a
            results-focused methodology

            The study examines three programs: (1)
            Korea Development Institute (KDI's) Knowledge Sharing
            Program (KSP) for advancing export development in the
            Dominican Republic; (2) KDI's KSP for promoting
            public-private partnerships and prefeasibility studies in
            Mongolia, along with providing support for deposit insurance
            reform; and (3) the World Bank's South-South Experience
            Exchange Facility for the New Economy Skills for Africa
            Program (NESAP) in India for sharing knowledge on
            information and communications technology with African
            countries, including Ghana and Nigeria. This study reveals
            important lessons for effectively conducting knowledge
            exchange programs that are applicable across sectors and
            countries. Its findings indicate support for innovative,
            results-focused capacity development approaches that
            emphasize the roles of state and non-state actors and
            promote collective action. The programs in this study used a
            variety of traditional and innovative instruments to foster
            collaborative behavior between diverse stakeholders that
            facilitated institutional change.
