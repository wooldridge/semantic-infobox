            Basic requirements for public participation
            in Kenya's legal framework
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Kenya has embarked on a highly ambitious
            decentralization that seeks to fundamentally change the
            relationship between government and citizens under the 2010
            Constitution. The Constitution and new legal framework place
            a strong emphasis on strengthening public participation.
            This paper summarizes findings and analysis from five
            working papers and case studies reviewing opportunities and
            challenges for strengthening public participation in
            Kenya's newly decentralized system. It provides a
            consolidated list of recommendations emerging from all the
            working papers.
