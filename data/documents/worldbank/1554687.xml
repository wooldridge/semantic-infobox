FOREWORD&#13;
Centrally planned economies (CPEs) account for a significant share of&#13;
the world's production and income.     In view of their importance in the world&#13;
economy, and to facilitate international comparative analysis, for many years&#13;
the World Bank has included statistical data on these countries in those of&#13;
its publications that aim for universal coverage, such as The World Bank&#13;
Atlas.   Among these data, those relating to gross national product (GNP) and&#13;
to GNP per capita are the most important, and the Bank also needs them for&#13;
operational purposes for its member countries, which now include some CPEs.&#13;
In the CPEs prices are generally set administratively and are often&#13;
loosely or not at all related to the relative scarcity and costs of production&#13;
of goods and services.    This is particularly true of the exchange rate.      The&#13;
World Bank normally uses exchange rates for converting GNP figures from&#13;
national   currencies   into   dollars   (or  into   any  other   numeraire),   an&#13;
indispensable   step   for  international   comparisons.     The   choice  of   an&#13;
appropriate conversion factor therefore poses particularly difficult problems&#13;
for most CPEs.   A further difficulty arises because the national accounts of&#13;
the CPEs are based on the concept of net material product (NMP), which differs&#13;
from the concept of GNP used in market economies.      To derive the GNP numbers&#13;
of those CPEs that compile only NMP accounts, various adjustments must be&#13;
made.   The data required for making these adjustments are not always fully&#13;
available.   Finally, a separate set of issues arises in relation to year to&#13;
year comparisons within the same CPE.       For these too and the corresponding&#13;
growth rates, official data are not strictly comparable to growth rates of the&#13;
market economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In early 1982 a research project sponsored and financed by the World&#13;
Bank was undertaken to assess alternative methods of computing the per capita&#13;
dollar GNP levels and growth rates of CPEs.        It covered eight countries:&#13;
Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary,&#13;
Poland, Romania and the U.S.S.R.    The purpose of this research project was to&#13;
define the best among known methods that could be applied to CPEs as a group&#13;
and make use of available data.    It was not its aim to establish and define&#13;
new computation methods whose application would have required many more years&#13;
of effort, even if data had been available.&#13;
This research project has produced eleven reports, which are&#13;
published   simultaneously.    The  main   report  authored  by   the  principal&#13;
researcher for the project, Paul Marer, is published as a book, Dollar GNPs of&#13;
the USSR and Eastern Europe (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985). The eight&#13;
country studies and two background papers are published separately in the&#13;
World Bank   Staff Working Paper series.      The main report provides highly&#13;
valuable insights into the problems related to the estimation and comparison&#13;
of the GNPs and GNP growth rates of the CPEs. It also gives the author's best&#13;
estimates of the actual values of these indicators for the majority of CPEs&#13;
covered by the project, that is those for which there was some statistical&#13;
basis for computing estimates or choosing between those already available.&#13;
The main report on the Research Project on CPEs concludes that&#13;
adequate GNP data in national currencies can be derived for most CPEs by&#13;
adjusting official information about net material product in the light of&#13;
statistical  and other information known to country experts.         It further&#13;
concludes that the best method generally applicable to CPEs for converting&#13;
such GNP data from local currencies into dollars would use conversion rates&#13;
based upon purchasing power parity (PPP) information.       For comparison with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
corresponding World Bank data on other World Bank members, these conversion&#13;
rates should be adjusted to correct for the expected differences between the&#13;
PPP rates and the actual official exchange rates (the "exchange rate deviation&#13;
index"). The needed adjustments are estimated econometrically from the actual&#13;
differences observed at each level of per capita GNP among the thirty-one&#13;
market economies participating in Phase III (1975) of the International&#13;
Comparison Project (ICP).    For Hungary, Romania, and Poland, PPP information&#13;
is derived from Phase III (1975) of the ICP, while for Czechoslovakia, the&#13;
German Democratic Republic, and the U.S.S.R., it is derived from private&#13;
bilateral comparisons chain-linked to the ICP data.       This method yields a&#13;
range of per capita GNP estimates: for example, $2,700 to $5,700 with a&#13;
midpoint of $4,190, for the U.S.S.R. in 1980.    No PPP estimate was available,&#13;
and no GNP per capita figure in US dollars calculated, for Bulgaria and Cuba.&#13;
The main report also concludes that the official estimates of growth&#13;
rates of the CPEs "tend to yield varying degrees of upward bias."        For all&#13;
countries except Hungary, the experts lean toward preferring alternative&#13;
indices, constructed by outside experts with partial information, although&#13;
these too present problems (especially for countries other than the U.S.S.R.)&#13;
and the experts therefore fell short of endorsing them.       The author of the&#13;
study on Hungary leans toward preferring the official index at this time.&#13;
The country studies and background papers that are being issued in&#13;
the World Bank Staff Working Paper series provide additional details on the&#13;
CPEs studied and their exchange rates.     Some of the country studies include&#13;
the respective authors' estimates of per capita GNP in U.S. dollars.       These&#13;
estimates, however, are the individual authors' experimental computations,&#13;
based on methods that may not be consistently applicable to CPEs generally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
There remain major uncertainties about GNP conversions by means of&#13;
"adjusted PPPs."  In addition to numerous remaining theoretical and practical&#13;
problems associated with calculating PPPs within the framework of the&#13;
centrally coordinated ICP, private estimates such as those used in this study&#13;
for three CPEs still appear to be subject to a wide margin of error.&#13;
Furthermore, there is no other way to estimate the exchange rate deviation&#13;
index than to derive it from observation of the countries covered by the ICP&#13;
(almost all of which are market economies).     The applicability of an index&#13;
derived in this fashion to the CPEs, whose economic structures are very&#13;
different, remains subject to reservations.&#13;
The present study used ICP Phase III data relating to the year 1975,&#13;
extrapolated to 1980.    Phase IV ICP data already published shows estimates&#13;
directly relating to 1980 for European countries, including Hungary and&#13;
Poland; Romania,   a participant in early phases of the ICP, has not provided&#13;
the data needed for participation in Phase IV. It is noteworthy that Phase IV&#13;
estimates of Hungary's and Poland's per capita GNP in 1980 are lower than the&#13;
1975 results extrapolated to 1980, used by the Research Report on CPEs. These&#13;
differences are partly due to the greater attention paid in Phase IV to&#13;
quality differences and to other methodological advances.&#13;
During the course of 1983 the Bank, with the help of a distinguished&#13;
panel of experts, 1/ undertook a review of the methodological problems and&#13;
issues related to the estimation of internationally comparable per capita GNP&#13;
figures for all countries. The preliminary results of the research project on&#13;
CPEs constituted an important input into that review, whose findings and&#13;
1/ Abram Bergson, Harvard University, Chairman; Andre Vanoli, Institut&#13;
National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques; and Parmeet Singh,&#13;
Commonwealth Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recommendations were approved by the panel of experts.         In light of the&#13;
review, the Bank has decided that for the time being (that is, at least until&#13;
data availability and other problems related to PPP information are resolved),&#13;
official GNP information converted at official exchange rates should generally&#13;
continue to provide the basis of the per capita GNP estimates published in The&#13;
World Bank Atlas.   Exceptions to this rule are to be made only when official&#13;
GNP data, in national currency, is exceptionally bad or compiled in ways which&#13;
diverge in an exceptionally large measure from the usual methods and&#13;
standards, or when the official exchange rate is exceptionally far removed&#13;
from the rate effectively governing foreign payments transactions. When there&#13;
is a reason to believe that such exceptional circumstances prevail, and&#13;
adequate information exists, appropriate adjustments are to be made.        When&#13;
adequate information does not exist and cannot be obtained, no estimates are&#13;
to be published.   At the time of writing this foreword, it seems likely that&#13;
lack of information will for some time prevent the Bank from making estimates&#13;
of the per capita GNP of most CPEs.     Thus The World Bank Atlas published in&#13;
early 1985 contains an estimate of the values of GNP and GNP per capita for&#13;
only one European CPE, Hungary.&#13;
Following the review endorsed by the panel of experts, the World Bank&#13;
has adopted calculation methods and obtained results which, for a few&#13;
countries, are different from those of the research project of CPEs.         The&#13;
Bank's general methodology must be applicable to all its member countries,&#13;
including most market economies and only a few CPEs; the Bank could demand&#13;
that its member countries provide additional information when needed; and it&#13;
could, and did, decide not to estimate the per capita GNP of countries for&#13;
which a minimal, but still fairly extensive set of information could not be&#13;
obtained. As noted earlier, however, the research project on CPEs has aimed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
at defining a method consistently applicable to all CPEs and one that could&#13;
make use of available information. These differences in aims and constraints&#13;
readily explain the differences in results.&#13;
The research project on CPEs, whose major findings are published in&#13;
the main report, has greatly enhanced the understanding of the CPEs' unique&#13;
macroeconomic accounting frameworks and pricing systems.        It has provided&#13;
insight into many substantive issues, in particular the relationship of&#13;
domestic and international prices. The individual country reports, published&#13;
separately, shed much light on many important country-specific issues.       The&#13;
Bank will continue to build upon the valuable findings of the research project&#13;
on CPEs in its future efforts to understand these important components of the&#13;
global economy.&#13;

ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper presents the results of a survey and critical analysis of&#13;
Cuban national accounts data. The paper first reviews available Cuban data on&#13;
the Material Product System (MPS), pointing out their strengths and&#13;
limitations. Then it carries out a similar analysis with respect to gross&#13;
domestic product (GDP) estimates based on the System of National Accounts&#13;
(SNA) and discusses inflation in Cuba and the difficulties in establishing the&#13;
proper peso/dollar exchange rate. The paper concludes with some judgments&#13;
regarding the most promising method for estimating Cuban GDP per capita in&#13;
dollars.&#13;
&#13;

SUMMARY&#13;
This paper presents the results of a survey and critical review of&#13;
Cuban national accounts data we undertook as part of the World Bank Project on&#13;
CPE National Income Statistics. Our objective was to gather and review all&#13;
available official Cuban national product statistics and independent estimates&#13;
both on the Material Product System (MPS) and the System of National Accounts&#13;
(SNA) with respect to reliability, consistency and reasonableness. In&#13;
particular, we were interested in determining if there were reliable estimates&#13;
of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars for certain benchmark years (1965, 1970, 1975,&#13;
1980), or of growth rates, which could be used to gauge the performance of the&#13;
Cuban economy. Finally, we were also interested in evaluating methodologies&#13;
which could be used to make meaningful estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in&#13;
dollars.&#13;
We found that Cuban data on the MPS are scanty, highly aggregated,&#13;
frequently revised, and affected by numerous methodological changes which are&#13;
not usually described. Data on the net material product (NMP) are only&#13;
available for 1962-66 and on gross material product (GMP) for 1962-75 and&#13;
1977-78, mostly at current prices. No time series data have ever been&#13;
published on the value of nonmaterial services (NMS). Data on the global&#13;
social product (GSP) are available for the entire period 1962-81 but are of&#13;
limited use because of methodological changes that result in four subseries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
which cannot be connected. Quantity indexes of industrial production are not&#13;
available either.&#13;
The review of indicators of Cuban aggregate economic performance&#13;
under the SNA included an estimate of Cuban GDP for 1974 prepared by Cuban&#13;
statisticians which resulted from a full-fledged MPS-SNA conversion exercise,&#13;
some data purportedly on growth rates of Cuban GNP reported in Soviet sources,&#13;
estimates of Cuban GDP, of GDP/capita in dollars, or of their growth rates&#13;
made by independent organizations such as the U.S. Central Intelligence&#13;
Agency, the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the World Bank, and&#13;
our own estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars made using the physical&#13;
indicators approach. We also considered the possibility of scaling up to GDP&#13;
by adding the value of NMS and depreciation to NMP.&#13;
After a careful review of all of the available information, we found&#13;
that none of the available estimates of Cuban GDP/capita, including our own&#13;
estimates based on physical indicators, appear to be reliable. Similarly,&#13;
estimates of growth rates of GDP/capita appear to suffer from lack of&#13;
relilability. Further, it is not feasible to use the scaling up method&#13;
because of the lack of availability of data on NMP and on the value of NMS.&#13;
However, Cuban officials have indicated their intention to extend the MPS-SNA&#13;
conversion exercise to other years. The resulting estimates of GDP/capita&#13;
could be the basis for further work to gauge the performance of the Cuban&#13;
economy.&#13;
Estimates of GDP/capita resulting from this MPS-SNA conversion&#13;
exercise are likely to be in pesos at current prices. In order to make&#13;
meaningful international comparisons, they would need to be converted to&#13;
constant prices and to dollars. As we note in the paper, an important, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
growing, part of the Cuban economy is affected by inflation. Thus, the&#13;
expansion of the government-controlled parallel market, the "free peasant"&#13;
markets and the dramatic increase in official consumer prices at the end of&#13;
1981 are evidence of the increasing relevance of inflation in the Cuban&#13;
economy. Despite this growing importance, there are no official data on the&#13;
price level in Cuba. Our analysis of the peso-dollar exchange rate has led us&#13;
to the conclusion, also reached by many others, that the official exchange&#13;
rate far overstates the purchasing power of the peso. However, there is no&#13;
reliable information on the degree of overvaluation which would permit the&#13;
estimation of alternative exchange rates.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
At the start of the 1960s, the Cuban government began to pursue a&#13;
socialist development path and made significant changes in economic&#13;
organization, including the adoption of central planning. As a result of&#13;
these changes the statistical data collection and processing system was&#13;
severely disrupted and the material balances system, more compatible with&#13;
central planning, adopted as the basic national accounting system. Thus, for&#13;
most economic series, a gap exists for 1959-61 and, beginning with 1962,&#13;
published data follow the Material Product System (MPS), which differs&#13;
substantially from the System of National Accounts (SNA) methodology used by&#13;
pre-revolutionary Cuba and by nearly all non-socialist nations.&#13;
Although the availability of Cuban economic data has improved over&#13;
the years, the Cuban government continues to provide only minimal data on the&#13;
national product and those which are available are subject to frequent&#13;
revisions and changes in methodology. At different points since 1964 the&#13;
Cuban government has published time series data on the global social product&#13;
(GSP), the gross material product (GMP) or the net material product (NMP), but&#13;
only GSP is available for the entire period 1962-81, albeit not calculated&#13;
with a consistent methodology. In 1982, Cuba for the first time released some&#13;
national product data following the SNA. All of the national product data&#13;
available from Cuban official sources are given in domestic currency (Cuban&#13;
pesos). Whereas the Cuban peso has not been freely exchanged in international&#13;
markets since 1962, it is not clear what exchange rate should be used to&#13;
convert Cuban data in pesos to another currency basis.&#13;
Because of the inadequacies in the official national product data,&#13;
several organizations outside of Cuba have made estimates of Cuba gross&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
domestic product (GDP) or of gross domestic product per capita (GDP/capita) in&#13;
dollars. These efforts, which have relied on different methodologies, have&#13;
yielded estimates of Cuban national product significantly different from one&#13;
another and from trends implied by the available official indicators.&#13;
This paper presents the results of a survey and critical review of&#13;
Cuban national product data and estimates we undertook as part of the World&#13;
dank Project on CPE National Income Statistics. Our objective was to gather&#13;
and review all available official Cuban national product statistics and&#13;
independent estimates with respect to reliability, consistency and&#13;
reasonableness. In particular, we were interested in determining if there&#13;
were reliable estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars for certain benchmark&#13;
years (1965, 1970, 1975 and 1980), or of growth rates, which could be used to&#13;
gauge the performance of the Cuban economy. Finally, we were also interested&#13;
in evaluating methodologies which could be used to make meaningful estimates&#13;
of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars.&#13;
In the first Section of this study we review available Cuban national&#13;
product data based on the MPS, pointing out their strengths and limitations.&#13;
In the second Section we carry out a similar analysis with respect to&#13;
estimates of Cuban national product data based on the SNA, especially the&#13;
estimate for 1974 made by Cuban statisticians. To the extent that is was&#13;
possible, we assess the methodologies used to make each of the estimates. We&#13;
also explore the possibility of making estimates of Cuban GDP/capita using two&#13;
other approaches: "scaling up" from NMP (or GMP) and physical indicators. In&#13;
Section 3 we discuss inflation in Cuba and in Section 4 we comment briefly on&#13;
the difficulties in establishing the proper peso/dollar exchange rate. The&#13;
paper concludes with our evaluation of the body of data and estimates on Cuban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

national product and some judgements regarding the most promising methods to&#13;
estimate Cuban GDP/capita in dollars provided additional information is&#13;
released by Cuba in the future. The study is based on information available&#13;
to us through the summer of 1982.&#13;
1.  Availability, Reliability and Consistency of Cuban MPS Data&#13;
Cuban national product data based on the MPS are scanty, highly&#13;
aggregated, frequently revised, and affected by numerous changes in&#13;
methodology usually not fully described. The principal source of official&#13;
Cuban national product data is the series of statistical yearbooks published&#13;
annually since 1965 (with the exception of 1969). /1 These yearbooks&#13;
regularly contain a section on "global indicators" (indicadores globales) with&#13;
a table on GSP and on the contribution to GSP by six major economic sectors.&#13;
A second table on the disposition of the national product has been omitted&#13;
from recent issues of the yearbook. Publications of the Cuban National Bank&#13;
(Banco Nacional de Cuba, BNC) also contain data on the national product which&#13;
complement those published in the statistical yearbooks. /2&#13;
/1   Issues of the statistical yearbook for 1964-68 and 1970-71 appeared under&#13;
the title Boletin Estadistico de Cuba (BEC) and were published by the&#13;
Junta Central de Planificaci6n (JUCEPLAN). Beginning with the issue for&#13;
1972, the title was changed to Anuario Estadistico de Cuba (AEC); issues&#13;
for 1972-74 were also published under the authority of JUCEPLAN.&#13;
Beginning with the issue for 1975, the yearbook has been published under&#13;
the authority of the Comit6 Estatal de Estadisticas (CEE). In this&#13;
report we will refer to the yearhooks as BEC and AEC.&#13;
/2   E.g., Banco Nacional de Cuba, Cuba: Economic and Social Development 1976-&#13;
80 and First Half 1981 (La Habana, 1981). In this report we refer to&#13;
publications of the Banco Nacional de Cuba as BNC followed by the&#13;
publication date.&#13;

1.1 GSP, GMP and NMP&#13;
Table 1 presents all the available Cuban data on Cuban GSP and its&#13;
components for 1962-69. (For definitions of GSP and its components see&#13;
Appendix A.) All figures are as reported in official Cuban sources except for&#13;
consumption of fixed capital (depreciation) which is obtained as a residual&#13;
(GMP-NMP). Data for 1962-66 are in constant 1965 prices, while those for&#13;
1967-69 are partly in current prices. /3 A reconstruction of the whole series&#13;
for 1962-69 in current prices is presented in Table 2 (this will be useful for&#13;
our discussion on inflation.) It was constructed using official Cuban data&#13;
and data from United Nations publications. /4 Figures contained in the latter&#13;
were carefully checked against the Cuban data and we are confident that the&#13;
United Nations figures, which were reported by Cuba directly to the UJnited&#13;
Nations Statistical Office, are consistent with the official Cuban data. In&#13;
the process, however, we discovered some errors and gaps in the United Nations&#13;
data which were corrected prior to including in the table.&#13;
Top officials of Cuba's Central Planning Board (Junta Central de&#13;
Planificaci6n, JUCEPLAN) confirmed in 1979 to one of the authors of this study&#13;
that GSP involved considerable double counting. For example, if production is&#13;
/3   The Swedish economist Claes Brundenius has compiled a table with all the&#13;
components of GSP. Although his work is important, he neither&#13;
distinguishes between current and constant prices nor between official&#13;
data and other sources. Furthermore, he does not acknowledge&#13;
methodological changes and, in many cases, the various components do not&#13;
add up correctly. See Brundenius, Economic Growth, Basic Needs and&#13;
Income Distribution in Revolutionary Cuba (Lund, Sweden: University of&#13;
Lund, Research Policy Institute, 1981), pp. 34-35.&#13;
/4   E.g., various issues of the United Nations Monthly Bulletin of Statistics&#13;
(BS), Statistical Yearbook (SY), and Yearbook of National Accounts&#13;
Statistics (YNAS). These publications are referred to as BS, SY or YNAS&#13;
followed by a date.&#13;

done by two units of the same vertically-integrated enterprise (e.g., leather&#13;
and shoes enterprise) then the value of leather output and the value added by&#13;
shoe production are summed hence avoiding double counting. However, if&#13;
leather and shoes are produced by two independent enterprises, the value of&#13;
final output is reported by each enterprise and hence the value of leather&#13;
used in producing the shoes is counted twice. /5&#13;
In the 1960s there was a process of vertical integration of pro-&#13;
duction units which resulted in a significant reduction of the total number of&#13;
enterprises probably reducing double counting in GSP. Conversely, in the&#13;
1970s, there was a process of disaggregation of large production units which&#13;
resulted in a ten-fold increase in the number of enterprises (from 300 to&#13;
3,000), hence increasing the potential for double counting and artificially&#13;
inflating GSP. In recogition of this problem, some Cuban publications state&#13;
that "to permit international comparisons, GMP measures the net output of&#13;
goods and [productive] services, thus avoiding double counting of intermediate&#13;
inputs." /6 Conceptually, GMP is less likely to be affected by double&#13;
counting than GSP. And yet a top official in the State Committee on&#13;
Statistics (Comite Estatal de Estadisticas, CEE) was skeptical in 1979 that&#13;
GMP "actually cleaned duplications and made possible the comparison with&#13;
national accounts.1"/7&#13;

Cuban statistical yearbooks for 1972-76 refer to the method of&#13;
"complete circulation" (circulaci6n completa) as the output valuation method&#13;
used in estimating GSP for the period 1970-76. Since 1977 (and retrospec-&#13;
tively for 1975-76) the method used is identified as "value at enterprise&#13;
exit" (a salida de empresa) except for agricultural output, which continues to&#13;
be calculated under the complete circulation method. Neither of the two terms&#13;
has been clearly defined in Cuban publications.&#13;
As we understand it, output valued at enterprise exit is calculated&#13;
using the producer's price, i.e., the value of the output of material goods&#13;
(including materials services) at the point they leave the producing&#13;
enterprise (including circulation tax). On the other hand, complete&#13;
circulation value is calculated using the purchaser's price, i.e., the&#13;
producer's price plus the value of "circulation," i.e., transportation,&#13;
storage and trade. Since the value of these material services are already&#13;
counted under the output of the transportation and trade sectors, the complete&#13;
circulation technique results in double counting. The method of output&#13;
valuation "at enterprise exit," currently in use, avoids this duplication.&#13;
Another interpretation of the methodological distinction, based on&#13;
United Nations definitions, is that value at "enterprise exit" is equivalent&#13;
to the "enterprise method" used in CPEs to value industrial output (which&#13;
excludes intermediate consumption) while "complete circulation" is equivalent&#13;
to the "gross turnover method" used to value agricultural output (which&#13;
includes intermediate consumption). /8 The only Cuban reference to the&#13;
/8   United Nations, Basic Principles of the System of Balances of the&#13;
National Economy, Series F, No. 17 (New York: United Nations, 1971), pp.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9-&#13;
distinction is not sufficiently clear. It states that under the current&#13;
methodology (unnamed) in the industrial sector, the value of production&#13;
"includes secondary activities of minor importance performed by industrial&#13;
enterprises" but, when such activities are of importance, "they are separated&#13;
and included in the proper sector." In construction, the method of valuation&#13;
"at sector [not enterprise] exit" is used which "eliminated the interrelations&#13;
between contracting and subcontracting enterprises." Finally in the&#13;
agricultural sector, the method of "complete circulation" is used which&#13;
"computes as production the intermediate goods produced and used as inputs by&#13;
the enterprise." /9&#13;
Whichever the explanation of the distinction is, adoption of&#13;
valuation at enterprise exit methodology, at least outside of agriculture,&#13;
should eliminate duplication either because it avoids double counting of&#13;
"circulation" services or intermediate consumption. Reasons for the change in&#13;
valuation methodology in 1977 were: the introduction of the first five-year&#13;
plan (1976-80) which fully integrated Cuba's plan with those of other member&#13;
nations of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA); the creation in&#13;
1976 of the State Committee on Statistics which centralized and standardized&#13;
Cuba's statistical system; and last, but not least, the beginning of the&#13;
introduction of the new Economic Planning and Management System (Sistema de&#13;
Direcci6n y Planificaci6n de la Economia, SDPE) which closely follows its&#13;
Soviet counterpart.&#13;

The previous discussion identifies two opposite trends in the&#13;
estimation of Cuba's GSP: the process of disaggregation of productive units&#13;
in the 1970s which probably increased double counting of intermediate inputs&#13;
thus inflating GSP, and the shift in the mid-1970s to the method of output&#13;
valuation "at enterprise exit" which probably tended to reduce double counting&#13;
of either circulation services or intermediate consumption thus deflating&#13;
GSP. Although it is impossible to assess the net effect of the two trends,&#13;
our calculated guess is that the two roughly offset each other.&#13;
Table 3 presents all available official data on Cuba's GSP for 1962-&#13;
81, distinguishing four different series which cannot be connected: (1) the&#13;
1962-66 series at constant prices and with unknown valuation methodology; (2)&#13;
the 1967-69 series at current prices and with unknown valuation methodology in&#13;
which there probably was a moderate increase in value not corresponding to&#13;
real output increase (more on this later); (3) the 1970-76 series at current&#13;
prices using the valuation method of complete circulation which probably&#13;
resulted in a significant increase in value not corresponding to real output&#13;
increase; and (4) the 1975-80 series at current prices with method of value at&#13;
enterprise exit which probably resulted in a significant decline in value&#13;
relative to earlier periods (about 12 percent in 1975 and 11 percent in 1976,&#13;
the only two years for which data on both bases are available). In addition,&#13;
the last two rows in Table 3 present two estimates of GSP at constant&#13;
prices: (1) for 1976 and 1980 (at 1978 prices); and (2) for 1980 and 1981 (at&#13;
1981 prices) suggesting an increase in the value of GSP of 10 percent in 1980&#13;
due to the price reform of 1981 (see Section 3.4).&#13;
A total reconstruction of the components of GSP in 1970-80 is&#13;
impossible due to the lack of data but all available figures are compiled in&#13;

Table 4. Data on consumption of fixed capital (depreciation) have not been&#13;
published since 1967; the Cubans have reported that the first national&#13;
inventory and evaluation of fixed capital assets, essential to calculate&#13;
depreciation, was not carried out until 1979. Data on variation in stocks&#13;
have not been published since 1970. The data on components of GSP for 1970-74&#13;
is based on United Nations sources but no figures on Cuba beyond 1974 appear&#13;
in any United Nations publications available through April 1982.&#13;
Data for 1975-80 in Table 4 come from different sources and may not&#13;
be consistent. Currently, Cuban statistical publications systematically&#13;
report only data on GSP and on trade balances. Estimates of GMP in 1975, 1977&#13;
and 1978 were released by two separate sources (BNC and the President of&#13;
JUCEPLAN) and we have been unable to confirm their reliability. GMP for 1976,&#13;
1979 and 1980 were estimated by the authors based on the historical relation-&#13;
ship between GMP and GSP (GMP was 62.5 percent of GSP) and hence their&#13;
reliability is highly questionable.&#13;
1.2 National Income Data&#13;
Data on national income are incomplete and scarce. Cuban statistical&#13;
yearbooks normally publish one table with data on the state civilian wage&#13;
fund, both total and for some economic sectors. In recent issues of the&#13;
yearbook, the wage fund has also been subdivided into wages paid to workers in&#13;
the productive and nonproductive spheres. Occasionally, data on payments by&#13;
the state to private farmers (for procurement of agricultural commodities&#13;
under a system of mandatory quotas) and to students have been released. No&#13;
information has ever been released in the statistical yearbooks on income&#13;
received by the military or by other noncivilian personnel. Data are also&#13;
available on pension and welfare payments under the social security system.&#13;

Table 5 presents all population income data available for 1962-78. Data on&#13;
the income of state enterprises have never been published; national budgets do&#13;
contain data on the contribution of state enterprises to total revenue but&#13;
only for selected years (see Section 2.1.3.)&#13;
1.3 Material Production Indexes&#13;
Cuban statistical yearbooks do not contain quantity indexes of&#13;
material production. Data on the value of output of material product sectors&#13;
(industry, agriculture, construction, transportation, communications, trade,&#13;
and other productive activities) are routinely reported in the yearbooks.&#13;
Table 6 presents available data on the value of output by material product&#13;
sectors gathered from official Cuban sources. It is clear that the data in&#13;
Table 6 suffer from the same lack of consistency problems noted above for the&#13;
GSP series. In effect, four unconnected sub-series on the value of output by&#13;
productive sectors exist because of changes in methodology, i.e., changes in&#13;
method of output valuation and in the price basis. (An independent researcher&#13;
has attempted to calculate indexes of Cuban material product which are free of&#13;
these methodological problems; his work is discussed in Appendix B.)&#13;
Cuban statistical yearbooks generally contain a table in which year-&#13;
to-year changes in the value of output of material product sectors and of GSP&#13;
are analyzed using index numbers. These index numbers at times have been&#13;
erroneously reported as being quantity indexes of material production. For&#13;
example, recent issues of the CMEA Statistical Yearbook contain series of&#13;
index numbers of Cuban GSP and of industrial production which could be&#13;
presumed to be quantity indexes. In effect, these indexes are merely the&#13;
value of output indexes published in Cuban sources rebased to either 1970 or&#13;
1975. (See Table 7). We have also detected some differences between the&#13;

2. Alternative Measures of Cuban National Product under the SNA&#13;
In addition to the official Cuban national product data on the MPS&#13;
discussed above, there are other indicators of Cuban aggregate economic&#13;
performance under the SNA which deserve careful attention. Of primary&#13;
importance are an estimate of Cuban GDP for 1974 prepared by Cuban&#13;
statisticians for an international seminar on MPS/SNA conversion and some data&#13;
purportedly on growth rates of Cuban GNP reported in Soviet sources. Also of&#13;
interest is the possibility of "scaling up" to GDP by adding the value of&#13;
nonmaterial services and depreciation to NMP.&#13;
There also exist several estimates of Cuban GDP, of GDP/capita in&#13;
dollars or of their growth rates which have been made by independent&#13;
organizations such as the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the U.S. Arms&#13;
Control and Disarmament Agency and the World Bank. Moreover, we have also&#13;
made some tentative estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars using the&#13;
physical indicators approach. These estimates are described in some detail&#13;
below.&#13;
2.1 Domestic Currency Estimates of Cuban National Product under the SNA&#13;
2.1.1  Cuban SNA Data&#13;
At the end of 1979, a Cuban planner reported that Cuban statisticians&#13;
had begun work to eliminate duplication from GSP so that it could be added to&#13;
the value of nonmaterial services to obtain a measure of national product&#13;
truly comparable with GNP. That information was confirmed in Havana, in mid-&#13;
1980, to one of the authors of this study with the added feature that an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
international seminar to discuss the United Nations MPS/SNA conversion&#13;
technique was planned. /10 The seminar, eventually held in Havana in May of&#13;
1982, was organized by the State Committee on Statistics and the United&#13;
Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) and attended by experts&#13;
from Latin America. The thrust of the seminar was a comparison of the use of&#13;
the MPS and the SNA in the region.&#13;
The principal document for the seminar was jointly prepared by ECLA&#13;
and the State Committee on Statistics with the advice of an expert from&#13;
Hungary's Central Statistical Office. /11 The document was based on several&#13;
United Nations publications which deal with theoretical and methodological&#13;
aspects of the comparison between the MPS and the SNA and took into account a&#13;
previous comparative study between Hungary and France. It is divided into&#13;
three chapters and two appendices: (1) a description of the essential&#13;
characteristics of the MPS and the SNA; (2) a general comparison of global&#13;
production, expenditures and income concepts in both systems, a description of&#13;
the SNA/MPS conversion technique developed by the United Nations, and a review&#13;
of some of the major problems inherent in that conversion; (3) an analysis of&#13;
the similarities and differences in the practical application of both systems&#13;
in Latin America and of the adjustments needed in the conversion; (4) a&#13;

of the MPS in Cuba. While the document does not add new information, it is&#13;
useful to understand some of the peculiarities in the application of both&#13;
systems in Latin America. Concerning Cuba, the document clarifies a few&#13;
definitional and methodological problems and recommends a method for&#13;
converting Cuba's MPS into SNA.&#13;
An actual conversion of Cuba's MPS into SNA, for the year 1974 only,&#13;
was described in another document, apparently prepared by Cuban CEE&#13;
technicians, and presented at the seminar. /12 It illustrates the derivation&#13;
of GDP from NMP according to (1) gross output and intermediate consumption&#13;
categories (reproduced in Table 8); (2) income categories (reproduced in Table&#13;
9); and (3) final use categories (reproduced in Table 10). The standard&#13;
United Nations SNA/MPS conversion technique /13 was used although with a good&#13;
number of modifications and adaptations. The Cuban document considers the&#13;
conversion as a "first approximation" and cautions that the results are&#13;
"preliminary" and "unofficial" due to several calculation problems explained&#13;
below.&#13;

While the conversion was done using 1974 data, many of the figures&#13;
had to be modified to adapt them to the enterprise exit output valuation&#13;
methodology introduced in 1977. We have already noted that Cuba's recalcu-&#13;
lation of national product in 1975 and 1976 (using the enterprise exit&#13;
valuation methodology) resulted in reductions in GSP of 12 and 11 percent,&#13;
respectively. Similarly, the recalculation of GSP for 1974 produces a&#13;
reduction of 8 percent when GSP figures using the complete circulation&#13;
methodology (13,424 million pesos in Table 4) are compared with those using&#13;
the enterprise exit methodology (12,479 million pesos in Table 8).&#13;
Recalculation of the value of intermediate consumption in 1974, the only other&#13;
comparable category in Tables 4 and 8, results in a reduction of 15 percent.&#13;
On the other hand, figures on personal consumption, gross fixed capital&#13;
formation (gross investment), and net exports reported in Table 10 are the&#13;
same as those in Table 4. Therefore, only certain figures were recalculated&#13;
and we do not know either the reasons for the selection or the technique used&#13;
to do it.&#13;
The CEE document considered that the estimate of Cuban GDP obtained&#13;
in the conversion exercise was somewhat undervalued because the estimate of&#13;
nonmaterial services used did not include a profit component as in market&#13;
economies. On the other hand, it is also noted that the calculations are done&#13;
in current prices, because estimates in constant prices were not possible.&#13;
Finally, figures are given in pesos and the document suggests that the only&#13;
acceptable international comparisons, those obtained through exchange rates&#13;
derived from the United Nations International Comparisons Project or the CMEA&#13;
comparative technique, are not yet applicable to Cuba.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

In addition to the problems noted above, we have found a significant&#13;
difference in the national product definitions in the CEE conversion exercise&#13;
compared to those normally used in Cuban statistical publications (and given&#13;
in Appendix A). The difference has to do with whether or not depreciation is&#13;
considered as a part of intermediate consumption. Thus, in the conversion&#13;
exercise (Table 8), NMP is derived by subtracting intermediate consumption&#13;
(which includes depreciation) from GSP. However, in Cuban statistical publi-&#13;
cations, subtracting intermediate consumption from GSP yields GMP; NMP is&#13;
obtained by subtracting depreciation from GMP, implying that depreciation is&#13;
not part of intermediate consumption-(see Appendix A and Tables 1, 2, 4).&#13;
In Table 11 we compare our estimates of the primary income of the&#13;
population (from Table 5) with those provided by the conversion exercise for&#13;
1974 (Table 9). In all cases, our estimates are substantially higher than&#13;
those reported by Cuba in the conversion exercise. For example, our estimate&#13;
of wages and salaries, which we consider to be conservative, is higher than&#13;
the officially reported figure by about 1.7 percent. Our higher estimate for&#13;
income from social security may result from the fact that while we rely on&#13;
payments data (and also include welfare payments, etc.), the Cuban document&#13;
uses only social security contributions. Conceivably, the net income of the&#13;
private sector could be excluded from primary income if it were considered&#13;
within the primary income of enterprises, but whether or not it is excluded,&#13;
our estimate of primary income of the population remains 5-9 percent higher&#13;
than reported by Cuba.&#13;
Since the Cuban MPS/SNA conversion is only available for one year and&#13;
the calculations are besieged by problems and unanswered questions, we feel&#13;
that its value is limited. It is not possible to use it as the basis for&#13;
&#13;

estimating GDP benchmarks for 1975 or 1980 because, with the exception of&#13;
1974, the data necessary to make the required adjustments are not available.&#13;
It would be even more difficult to estimate GDP for 1970 (or any years prior&#13;
to 1974) relying on the results of the conversion exercise because, in&#13;
addition to all the difficulties noted above, MPS data for that year would&#13;
need to be recalculated using the enterprise exit valuation methodology.&#13;
2.1.2. Soviet Data on Cuban GNP&#13;
Since 1976, the International Bank for Economic Cooperation (IBEC)&#13;
has been publishing an Economic Bulletin which occasionally reports growth&#13;
rates of national income and industrial production of its members, including&#13;
Cuba. Although data for Cuba are sometimes not reported, when they are they&#13;
refer to growth in "gross national product (GNP)," rather than in national&#13;
income and in industrial production.&#13;
The possibility that Cuba might have been reporting estimates of&#13;
growth in GNP to IBEC for over ten years and not publishing these data&#13;
domestically or, alternatively, that IBEC has made independent estimates of&#13;
growth in Cuban GNP is intriguing. The IBEC has not explained why it has&#13;
chosen to report Cuban economic performance in terms of growth rates of GNP&#13;
rather than of national income, as it is done for the other member countries,&#13;
or how it has converted Cuban GSP data to obtain GNP.     Further, IBEC does not&#13;
indicate whether the reported data are based on data at current or constant&#13;
prices. While we can not definitively rule out that the data reported by IBEC&#13;
might indeed be the result of an actual MPS/SNA conversion, we are highly&#13;
skeptical. Instead, we suspect that in some cases the IBEC might be reporting&#13;
changes in GSP rather than in GNP (as it appears to be the case for 1978) and&#13;
in others the reported data are erroneous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Table 12 presents all GNP and industrial production growth rates data&#13;
on Cuba reported by the IBEC in the Economic Bulletin and compares them with&#13;
official Cuban statistics. The first two columns compare GNP growth rates&#13;
reported by IBEC with official GSP growth rates (except for 1978 in which the&#13;
growth rate reported by IBEC appears to refer to GSP). Official Cuban GSP&#13;
growth rates are systematically higher than the GNP growth rates reported by&#13;
IBEC. Interestingly, IBEC reports the same rate of growth of GNP for either&#13;
1970-74 or 1971-74 (40 percent), suggesting that there was no growth in GNP in&#13;
1970-71, while according to official Cuban data, GSP grew by 7.3 percent&#13;
between 1970 and 1971. Comparison of the IBEC and official growth rates of&#13;
industrial production raises serious questions about the accuracy of the IBEC&#13;
data. Industrial production growth rates reported by IBEC systematically&#13;
exceed those obtained from official Cuban data. More disturbing is the&#13;
significant differences in the growth rates themselves. For example,&#13;
according to IBEC, Cuban industrial production grew by 39 percent during 1971-&#13;
74; the corresponding expansion in industrial production using Cuban official&#13;
data was 29.1 percent.&#13;
2.1.3 Scaling up to GDP&#13;
A method for estimating GDP which has been used quite successfully&#13;
for several CPEs is the method of "scaling up" from official NMP (or GMP) to&#13;
GDP. Following this approach, GDP is estimated by adding to NMP the net value&#13;
added in the nonmaterial (service) sectors plus depreciation and making other&#13;
adjustments to ensure that the resulting estimate of GDP adheres to SNA&#13;

principles. /14 (Alternatively, GMP and net value added in the nonmaterial&#13;
sectors can be added to obtain GDP.)&#13;
As has been noted above (Section 1.1), since the early 1970s GSP is&#13;
the only national product indicator regularly published in Cuban statistical&#13;
sources. In Table 4 we have reported fragmentary data on GMP for the 1970s&#13;
culled from United Nations publications, a limited-circulation report of the&#13;
National Bank and a monograph by a high-level Cuban official. We suspect that&#13;
these estimates of Cuban GMP are subject to the changes in valuation&#13;
methodology which also affect GSP data.&#13;
More importantly, there are no data on the value added by nonmaterial&#13;
sectors nor does it appear possible to construct them. With one exception&#13;
(the converison exercise described in Section 2.1.1), Cuba has not published&#13;
data on the value of nonmaterial services (NMS). One way to approximate the&#13;
value of NMS might be to rely on expenditures data from the national budget;&#13;
national budget data for all the years for which they are available (1962-65&#13;
and 1978-82) are reproduced in Table 13. (National budgets were not published&#13;
for the period 1966-77; in fact, some government officials have suggested that&#13;
budgets were not even prepared for at least some of those years.) It should&#13;
be noted that the data in Table 13 refer to projections of revenues and&#13;
expenditures; data on actual revenues and expenditures have seldom been&#13;
published and then not completely.&#13;

Another possible way to estimate indirectly the size of nonmaterial&#13;
services is to rely on the distribution of employment and salaries between the&#13;
productive and nonproductive spheres of the economy. Unfortunately, this&#13;
distribution is only available for 1977-78 and excludes military and&#13;
intelligence personnel as well as private employment. The largest contingent&#13;
in the latter are private farmers (in the productive sphere) and it roughly&#13;
compensates for military personnel (in the nonproductive sphere). (The share&#13;
of employment/salary corresponding to the nonproductive sphere was roughly&#13;
25/26 percent for 1977 and 26/27 percent for 1978. /15)&#13;
Merely to illustrate the scaling up procedure, in Table 14 we have&#13;
added to GMP an estimate of the value of NMS obtained from budget expenditures&#13;
on social services to obtain very rough estimates of GDP.    Estimates are&#13;
presented for four years, 1963-65 and 1978, the only years for which both GMP&#13;
and budget data are available.   Also included in the table are estimates of&#13;
Cuban GDP and NMS for 1974 obtained from the official conversion exercise.&#13;
The value of NMS from the conversion exercise has been obtained by combining&#13;
the value of services supplied by government units and nonproductive&#13;
enterprises plus the value of housing maintenance. Thus, the value of NMS in&#13;
1974 is estimated to have been 1,236 million pesos (bottom row of Table 8) or&#13;
2,160 million pesos if the value of NMS in intermediate consumption is&#13;
considered (first row of Table 8). Taking the former estimate, in 1974 NMS&#13;
accounted for 13.3 percent of GDP.&#13;
Using the estimates of Cuban GDP in Table 14 obtained using the&#13;
scaling up methodology, it can be calculated that NMS accounted for 21 to 23.6&#13;
/15 AEC 78, pp. 57-58 and AEC 79, pp. 57-58.&#13;

percent of the value of CDP in 1963-65; the contribution of NMS to estimated&#13;
GDP was 30 percent in 1978. This estimate of the magnitude of the&#13;
nonproductive sphere is in line with estimates obtained using other indicators&#13;
or international comparisons. Thus, according to the 1970 population census,&#13;
24.6 percent of the economically active population was listed as occupied in&#13;
providing nonproductive services (social services and other nonproductive&#13;
activities such as political and mass organizations, etc.) /16 while a&#13;
demographic survey taken in 1979 found that 28.6 percent of all workers were&#13;
employed in the nonproductive sphere. /17 As noted earlier, employment in the&#13;
nonproductive sphere accounted for 25 and 26 percent of total employment in&#13;
1977 and 1978, respectively, while salaries in the nonproductive sphere&#13;
accounted for 26 and 27 percent of the total wage bill for 1977 and 1978,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
The last two columns of Table 14 present estimates of the average&#13;
proportion of NMS in GDP for Latin America for each of the years for which we&#13;
have made estimates of Cuban GDP. Except for 1978, the NMS/GDP ratio for&#13;
Latin American and Caribbean Basin nations and our estimated ratio for Cuba&#13;
are quite similar. For 1978, our estimated NMS/GDP ratio for Cuba is well&#13;
above either the Latin American or Caribbean averages, but reasonably close to&#13;
the ratios for Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica.&#13;
Notwithstanding the above discussion, the fact remains that the only&#13;
year for which value of NMS is available is 1974, and in that year the NMS/GDP&#13;

ratio was only 13.3 percent. Even if we take into account the Cuban claim&#13;
that the value of NMS in the conversion exercise is understated since profits&#13;
are not included, and therefore the NMS/GDP ratio is also understated, the&#13;
large gap between the NMS/GDP ratio calculated from the scaling up GDP&#13;
estimates and from the Cuban data put into question the use of budget&#13;
expenditures data as a proxy for the value of NMS. Given the lack of&#13;
availability of data on GMP and on the value of NMS, our judgement is that it&#13;
is not possible to use the scaling up method to estimate Cuban GDP.&#13;
2.2 Dollar Estimates of Cuban National Product Under the SNA&#13;
2.2.1 Central Intelligence Agency Estimates&#13;
In a publication dealing with Cuban foreign trade released in July&#13;
1975, /18 the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) published the following&#13;
estimates of Cuban average GNP growth rates:&#13;
1961-73:              1.8 percent&#13;
1968-73:              negligible&#13;
1974:                 4 to 6 percent&#13;
To the best of our knowledge, these are the first estimates of Cuban GNP&#13;
growth rates published by the CIA. A year later, in a compendium of Cuban&#13;
statistics /19, the CIA published an estimate of Cuban GNP for 1974 (8.3&#13;
billion pesos or $7.5 billion) and series of index-numbers of GNP and of&#13;
GNP/capita both in pesos for 1968-75. (See Table 15.) The estimates were&#13;
reported to refer to constant prices of 1957. Finally, in a more recent&#13;

publication, /20 the CIA reported estimates of Cuban GNP and GNP/capita in&#13;
U.S. dollars for 1978 ($13.3 billion and $1,380 per capita), as well as an&#13;
average annual GNP growth rate of 2.8 percent for the period 1959-78.&#13;
The CIA methodology for estimating the GNP growth rates in pesos is&#13;
as follows: (i) For the goods-producing sectors (agriculture, industry,&#13;
sugar production), physical output indexes were constructed using production&#13;
data for key commodities. Generally, official Cuban production data were&#13;
used. However, for certain agricultural products for which official data&#13;
ignore production by the private sector, reported production data referring to&#13;
government procurement (acopio) was adjusted upward by about 10 - 15&#13;
percent. The individual physical output indices were aggregated to produce&#13;
sectorial indexes using retail prices for 1957. (ii) For the productive&#13;
service sectors (construction, transportation, communications), output indexes&#13;
were developed based on the behavior of key variables such as apparent&#13;
consumption of construction materials and freight and passenger traffic, based&#13;
on official sources. (iii) The indexes for each sector were aggregated using&#13;
as weights the contribution of each sector to GNP in 1957. The GNP benchmark&#13;
estimates were made using official Cuban data on GMP at current prices and&#13;
adding to it estimates of the value of nonmaterial services such as health,&#13;
education and public administration. For example, the GNP figure for 1974 of&#13;
8.264 billion pesos (rounded off to 8.3 billion pesos) was obtained by adding&#13;
the estimated value added by nonmaterial services (0.850 billion pesos) to the&#13;
official GMP at current prices for 1974 of 7.414 billion pesos (see&#13;

Table 4). Thus, according to the CIA estimates, nonmaterial services&#13;
accounted for 11.29 percent of GNP and 11.46 percent of GMP in 1974. These&#13;
CIA estimates are not far off from the 13.3 percent ratio of NMS to GDP&#13;
obtained by Cuban statisticians in the 1974 MPS/SNA conversion.&#13;
Because the CIA estimates of GNP growth in Table 15 are based on&#13;
constant prices while the official MPS national product series for the same&#13;
period are reported in current prices, it is not possible to compare the&#13;
behavior of the two. The average GNP growth rates reported by the CIA in the&#13;
different publications raise some concerns about consistency. Thus, while in&#13;
the 1975 publication GNP growth during 1968-73 is reported as negligible,&#13;
estimates in Table 15 suggest that GNP during that period rose by 11.8&#13;
percent. Likewise, the average annual GDP growth for the period 1959-78 of&#13;
2.8 percent reported in the most recent CIA publication suggests much faster&#13;
growth during the second half of the 1970s than appears warranted.&#13;
2.2.2 U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Estimates&#13;
The U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) annual publi-&#13;
cation World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers includes estimates of&#13;
Cuban GNP in current and constant dollars for 1963-75. The ACDA does not&#13;
specify the sources or the methodology used for Cuba. The "Statistical Notes&#13;
and Sources" in the 1967-76 volume give the CIA Handbook of Economic Statis-&#13;
tics for 1976 and 1977 as the source for GNP data for the Soviet Union, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Warsaw Pact nations and the People's Republic of China. /21 It is also noted&#13;
that "estimates for other communist countries are rough approximations". /22&#13;
Personal communication with ACDA staff responsible for the yearbooks has&#13;
failed to throw any light on the origin of the Cuban GNP estimates. /23&#13;
The methodology for conversion of the CPE's GNP in local currency into U.S.&#13;
dollars is only explained in some detail for the USSR. Constant GNP was&#13;
apparently estimated "by 'deflating' the current local currency values to&#13;
constant 1975 local currency values and then converting to U.S. dollar equi-&#13;
valents." No specific information is provided for other CPEs.&#13;
The ACDA estimates of GNP at current prices for Cuba reported in the&#13;
1963-73 volume (see Table 16) are substantially higher than those reported in&#13;
subsequent volumes; the GNP estimate for 1973 in the 1965-74 volume is&#13;
substantially lower than the corresponding estimate in subsequent volumes&#13;
suggesting that it might be erroneous. The rest of the estimates in current&#13;
prices in the five most recent volumes are fairly similar. Comparisons of the&#13;
GNP estimates at constant prices are more difficult because all the volumes&#13;
use a different price base year. The series in the volumes 1966-75 and&#13;
/21 GNP estimates for Cuba are not included in either of the two CIA&#13;
Handbooks mentioned or in more recent ones. See, e.g., CIA, Handbook of&#13;

1967-76 are the longest and most consistent,-and, hence the best for&#13;
comparative purposes.&#13;
While it is reasonable to assume that the Cuban GNP estimates used by&#13;
the ACDA originated from the CIA, several checks with the CIA data on GNP&#13;
reproduced in Table 15 do not appear to support such an assumption. When ACDA&#13;
GNP estimates (for 1967-76) are converted into index numbers to compare them&#13;
with the CIA indexes, the difference between the two series is quite signi-&#13;
ficant: both GNP and GNP/capita CIA growth rates are significantly higher&#13;
than ACDA rates for five of the seven years; furthermore, during the economic&#13;
boom years of 1974-75, the ACDA estimates suggest negative growth while those&#13;
of CIA present the opposite picture. The annual average growth rate of GNP&#13;
for 1969-75 is twice as high according to the CIA (2.5 percent) than to the&#13;
ACDA (1.2 percent) while the GNP/capita average growth rate is negative for&#13;
the ACDA (-0.6 percent using the 1967-76 ACDA volume) and positive for the CIA&#13;
(0.8 percent). (See Tables 15 and 17).&#13;
2.2.3 World Bank Estimates&#13;
Probably the most widely used estimates of Cuban CDP/capita in&#13;
dollars, and of growth rates of Cuban CDP/capita in dollars, are those which&#13;
have been made by the World Bank. Since the mid-1960s, the World Bank has&#13;
published such estimates in its annual Atlas. Overall, the World Bank has&#13;
made estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars for the period 1964-79 (see&#13;
Table 18.) With the 1980 Atlas, the World Bank has discontinued publication&#13;
of GDP/capita in dollars for Cuba.&#13;
As is apparent from Table 18, the World Bank has used different&#13;
methodologies over time to estimate Cuban GDP/capita in dollars. (In Appendix&#13;
C we have attempted to describe and evaluate the methodologies which the World&#13;

Bank used to make their estimates.) Estimates for the period 1964-69 included&#13;
in the first six issues of the Atlas were presumably obtained uoing the same&#13;
methodology. The estimates suggest that during this period the Cuban economy&#13;
deteriorated steadily, with GNP/capita in dollars declining by over one-fifth&#13;
in the interim.&#13;
Beginning with the estimate for 1970, conceptual changes were made in&#13;
the Atlas which make GDP/capita estimates before and after 1970 not&#13;
comparable. Prior to 1970, estimates referred to GDP at factor prices&#13;
converted to dollars using the official exchange rate for each year. After&#13;
1970, estimates refer to GDP at market prices converted to dollars using&#13;
official exchange rates for a multi-year period. While the World Bank&#13;
suggested that GDP/capita estimates rose on average by about 20 percent as a&#13;
result of these changes, GDP/capita for Cuba increased by 89 percent,&#13;
suggesting that the calculation methodology also changed.&#13;
It appears that the 1970 estimate of Cuban GDP at market prices may&#13;
have been done by scaling up from GDP assuming that the value of NMS was 10&#13;
percent of GMP. The estimates for the succeeding years do not appear to have&#13;
been based on the same approach, however, as Cuban GMP data for the first half&#13;
of the 1970s showed consistent growth while the Atlas reported a different&#13;
pattern. An entirely new methodology appears to have been used in the Atlas&#13;
for 1979 and 1980 (estimates for 1977-79.) The estimates for 1977 and 1978&#13;
were based on benchmark estimates of Cuban GDP from the I.S. Arms Control and&#13;
Disarmament Agency (see Section 2.2.2) and certain assumptions regarding&#13;
growth of GDP. World Bank estimates for this period show virtually no&#13;
increase in GDP/capita in dollars between 1975 and 1978, while Cuban official&#13;
data indicate that GSP/capita increased by 13.6 percent over this period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The estimate of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars for 1979 appearing in the&#13;
1980 Atlas has been made using yet another methodology. The estimate for 1979&#13;
($1410) is 74.1 percent higher than the estimate for 1978 which appeared in&#13;
the previous issue of the Atlas. The lack of consistency in the estimates of&#13;
GDP/capita for Cuba in the Atlas can be dramatized by looking at the growth&#13;
rate estimates. In the 1979 Atlas it is reported that Cuban GDP/capita in&#13;
dollars contracted at a rate of 1.2 percent per year during 1970-78; according&#13;
to the 1980 Atlas, Cuban GDP/capita in dollars grew by 4.7 percent per year&#13;
during 1970-78.&#13;
2.2.4 Physical Indicators Approach&#13;
We have made some tentative estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars&#13;
for 1965, 1970, 1975 and 1977 using the physical indicators (PI) approach.&#13;
Two sets of estimates have been made using two variants of the PI approach, a&#13;
univariate variant and a multivariate variant. The methodology used in making&#13;
the two sets of estimates is given in Appendix D.&#13;
The first two columns of Table 19 present our estimates of Cuban&#13;
GDP/capita in dollars obtained from the PI approach. The estimates, converted&#13;
to constant dollars of 1965, are reported in columns 3 and 4. Corresponding&#13;
implied growth rates derived from the estimates are given in the bottom panel&#13;
of the table. Also included in Table 19 are Cuban data on GSP/capita in pesos&#13;
and in dollars (using the official exchange rate) and corresponding growth&#13;
rates).&#13;
The estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars obtained from the&#13;
univariate and multivariate PI approaches are remarkably consistent. With the&#13;
exception of the estimates for 1975, which differed by about 12 percent, the&#13;
estimates for the other three benchmark years were within three percent. The&#13;

implied growth rate estimates for 1965-70 were quite close (5.9 vs. 5.2&#13;
percent per annum), but those for 1970-75 and 1975-77 differed substan-&#13;
tially. These differences are not surprising given the disparity in&#13;
GDP/capita estimates for 1975 noted above. However, the implied growth rate&#13;
for the longer period 1970-77 were remarkably similar (11.3 vs. 11.0 percent&#13;
per annum).&#13;
In order to compare the behavior of the PI GDP/capita growth rate&#13;
estimates with those obtained from Cuban GSP data, we have converted them to&#13;
constant prices (of 1965) since the Cuban GSP data reflect primarily constant&#13;
prices. For 1965-70 and 1970-75, the estimated constant-dollar GDP/capita&#13;
growth rates suggest that the Cuban economy expanded at a substantially slower&#13;
pace than would be inferred from the official GSP data. The growth rates&#13;
implied by the PI constant-price estimates for 1965-70 (either 0.9 percent or&#13;
1.6 percent per annum) appear more reasonable than the 2.5 percent per annum&#13;
rate of growth obtained from the official GSP data in light of the overall&#13;
economic disorganization which prevailed in Cuba over this period. Likewise,&#13;
the estimated growth rates for 1970-75 (either 2.9 or 5.1 percent per annum)&#13;
appear more credible than the astonishing 15.9 percent per annum implied by&#13;
the official GSP data.&#13;
However, for the period 1975-77, the estimated GDP/capita growth&#13;
rates (either 4.0 or 8.5 percent per annum) appear unreasonable in the context&#13;
of the economic slowdown which Cuba experienced in the second half of the&#13;
1970s and is reflected in virtually stagnant GSP/capita in pesos over 1975-&#13;
77. The lack of sensitivity of the PI estimates to the changed economic&#13;
conditions raises serious questions about the overall utility of the approach&#13;
to make estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

While some of the results of our experimentation with the PI approach&#13;
appear reasonable in the light of analyses of the Cuban economy in the last&#13;
two decades, others are questionable. We are not totally persuaded that the&#13;
estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars we have obtained from the PI approach&#13;
are significantly more reliable than those made using other methodologies and&#13;
caution against their indiscriminate use.&#13;
More generally, we question the applicability of the PI method to&#13;
make estimates of GDP/capita in dollars for Cuba. The PI approach was&#13;
developed as a method to estimate GDP/capita for Hungary. Most applications&#13;
have focused on Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, nations which are&#13;
characterized by industrialized and stable economies rarely affected by wide&#13;
year-to-year economic swings. In monoculture-type economies like Cuba, where&#13;
one or a few commodities subject to highly volatile price behavior contribute&#13;
disproportionately to national product, fluctuations in commodity prices in&#13;
the world market can have significant influence on short-term economic&#13;
performance. These external shocks may not be reflected in the behavior of&#13;
consumption-oriented physical indicators or maybe reflected only after a&#13;
lag. For example, a dramatic drop in the world market price of sugar sharply&#13;
curtailed Cuban economic growth during 1975-77; this is reflected in a&#13;
significant slowdown in growth rates of GSP/capita. However, estimates of&#13;
Cuban GDP/capita based on the behavior of more stable physical indicators&#13;
failed to register the recession provoked in Cuba by the drop in sugar prices.&#13;

3. The Price System and Inflation&#13;
3.1 The Price System /24&#13;
Since 1961 all prices in Cuba are administratively set by the state,&#13;
with the exception of those at "free peasant markets" and in the black&#13;
market. The state agency in charge of prices is the State Committee on Prices&#13;
(Comite Estatal de Precios, CEP), which has higher rank than a ministry.&#13;
There are three levels of state-fixed domestic prices in Cuba:&#13;
enterprise, wholesale and retail. The enterprice price is made up by the cost&#13;
of production plus the mark up or profit. The wholesale price is formed by&#13;
the enterprise price plus the "circulation tax," plus the costs and mark up of&#13;
the wholesale trading enterprises. Finally the retail price results from&#13;
adding to wholesale price the costs and mark up of retail trading enter-&#13;
prises./25 In addition, there is the state procurement (acopio) price paid to&#13;
private farmers for products they are required to sell to the state, which is&#13;
set below the market price. Data are not available on either enterprise,&#13;
wholesale or acopio prices and only for few products and years on retail&#13;
prices.&#13;
In addition to the "circulation tax," enterprises pay a planned tax&#13;
on profit (which was introduced at the end of the 1970s) and a social security&#13;
tax. The population income tax was abolished in the mid-1960s, but private&#13;

farmers and self-employed workers engaged in delivering personal services now&#13;
have to pay a tax based on income.&#13;
According to official figures, 30 percent of consumer goods (measured&#13;
in terms of value and including the most important foodstuffs and beverages,&#13;
plus tobacco and essential--footwear and clothing items) are allocated through&#13;
a rationing system. Prices of rationed goods were practically unchanged from&#13;
March 1962 (when rationing began) until December 1981 (when a retail price&#13;
reform took place). Prior to the price reform, the state heavily subsidized&#13;
the price of rationed goods; for instance, while the real price of a pound of&#13;
beef in 1979 was estimated at 0.80 pesos, it was sold under the rationing&#13;
system at 0.44 to 0.55 pesos. The cumulative consumption subsidy amounted to&#13;
1,887 million pesos in 1976-81 and, even with the price increases introduced&#13;
at the end of 1981, the state still will subsidize consumption by 671 million&#13;
pesos in 1982-85. /26&#13;
To combat a fledgling black market and provide incentives to high&#13;
income groups, in 1973 the government established an official "parallel&#13;
market," in which surplus goods are sold at prices (fixed by the state) which&#13;
reflect supply and demand; parallel-market prices are from three to eight&#13;
times higher than rationing prices, but lower than black market prices. (See&#13;
Table 20). Since 1973, certain consumer durables (e.g., TV sets, refrige-&#13;
rators, sewing machines) are distributed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade&#13;
(Ministerio del Comercio Interior, MINCIN) through a system of quotas to state&#13;
enterprises. These enterprises then advertise the availability of goods and&#13;
accept purchase applications from prospective buyers. Particularly hard&#13;

working and productive workers are rewarded by being allowed to purchase the&#13;
goods. Prices of these consumer durables are set very high (see Table 20)&#13;
both as an incentive to workers to work harder and as a way to siphon out the&#13;
monetary surplus.&#13;
Since 1962 the black market has flourished in spite of government&#13;
efforts to curtail it, particularly in 1968. Prices in the black market are&#13;
from five to fifteen times higher than the rationing price (see Table 20). In&#13;
a further effort to combat the black market, the government authorized in 1980&#13;
the operation of "free peasant markets" in which private farmers are allowed&#13;
to sell any agricultural surplus--except beef, tobacco and coffee--over their&#13;
procurement quotas. Prices are not regulated; they have tended to be much&#13;
higher than rationing prices but apparently lower than black market prices.&#13;
3.2 Inflation&#13;
Since the early 1960s an inflationary process took place in Cuba&#13;
fueled by the widening gap between demand and supply of consumer goods.&#13;
Demand swelled due to the raise in population income (or disposable income)&#13;
generated by full employment, guaranteed annual wages, increased minimum wages&#13;
and pensions, and expansion of free social services. The supply of consumer&#13;
goods was negatively affected by stagnation in domestic output, reduction of&#13;
imports and exportation of goods previously destined for internal consumption.&#13;
For political and social reasons, the Cuban government decided in 1962 to&#13;
freeze prices of consumer goods and to introduce rationing rather than allow&#13;
prices to rise. Most families, however, received incomes which far exceeded&#13;
the value of their personal consumption--that is, the cost of the monthly&#13;
ration basket of goods and of the few nonrationed goods and non-free social&#13;
services available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
The difference between the population income and the value of its&#13;
personal consumption is the monetary surplus--that is, excess money in&#13;
circulation with which goods or services cannot be acquired. According to the&#13;
estimates of one of the authors (Table 21), the monetary surplus steadily&#13;
increased in the 1960s so that in 1970 it had reached a peak of 86 percent&#13;
over the population income. In other words, in 1970 the income of the&#13;
population exceeded by almost twofold the value of goods and services&#13;
available for purchase.&#13;
This situation, officially described as one of "tremendous&#13;
inflation," did not result in price increases of rationed goods but reduced&#13;
work incentives, encouraged labor absenteeism (officially estimated at 20&#13;
percent of the labor force in 1970) and sent prices in the black market&#13;
skyrocketing. In order to reduce the money in circulation, consumer demand&#13;
was curtailed by establishing the parallel market, which increased prices of&#13;
goods, postponing or abandoning promises of eliminating rents and increasing&#13;
minimum wages, charging a fee for services previously provided free, etc., and&#13;
the supply of goods was increased by expanding production or imports of&#13;
certain consumer durables. As a result of these measures, the monetarysurplus&#13;
was reduced in 1971-75, hence inducing "a deflationary process." /27 But&#13;
world inflation, accelerated after 1973 by the energy crisis, together with&#13;
the decline in world sugar prices which forced the curtailment of imports,&#13;
resulted in a new expansion of the monetary surplus in 1976-78. New measures&#13;

to reduce the monetary surplus such as the free peasant markets, were&#13;
introduced at the end of the 1970s. And yet, in i981, the government made&#13;
significant changes in the wage structure which resulted in an overall wage&#13;
raise of 14 percent and aggravated inflationary pressures.&#13;
3.3 Estimates of Inflation&#13;
Cuba has published estimates of GSP and its major components both in&#13;
current and constant prices only for 1962-66. Table 22 reproduces series for&#13;
GSP, GMP and NMP, on both bases and presents our estimates of the annual rates&#13;
of inflation in 1963-66 derived from these data. Estimated inflation rates&#13;
are similar across all three variables, but especially for GMP and NMP; the&#13;
average annual rate of inflation can be roughly estimated at between 5 and 6&#13;
percent.&#13;
As we have discussed above (Section 1.1), after 1966 Cuban&#13;
statistical yearbooks have systematically reported data on GSP and its&#13;
components only at current prices. Yet in 1975 Cuba's National Bank argued&#13;
that because prices in the agriculture, industry, construction and communi-&#13;
cations sectors have been frozen since 1965, the reported value of output for&#13;
those four sectors is at constant prices; since prices in the trade and&#13;
transportation sectors have changed, value of output for those two sectors is&#13;
reported at current prices. /28 It is not strictly accurate to say that all&#13;
prices in the four mentioned sectors were frozen, however. For instance, the&#13;
prices of some products which were taken out of the rationing system increased&#13;
significantly (e.g., eggs by 60 percent between 1964 and 1974.) Thus, the&#13;

combined contribution of the transportation and trade sectors to GSP rose&#13;
steadily from 30.8 percent in 1968 to 42.1 percent in 1979 probably in part as&#13;
a result of the effect of inflation on these two sectors.&#13;
Based on data in Table 4, the average annual growth rate of GSP at&#13;
current prices during 1976-80 was 4.9 percent. On two occasions the National&#13;
Bank has reported the average annual rate of GSP at constant prices during&#13;
this period at 4.0 percent. /29 Hence, we may surmise that the average annual&#13;
rate of inflation in 1976-80 was 0.9 percent. According to Table 3, GSP in&#13;
current prices in 1976 was 14,089 million pesos but in constant (1978) prices&#13;
was 14,487 million, a difference of 2.8 percent. Due to the wholesale price&#13;
reform of January 1981, GSP for 1980 was revalued from 17,369 million pesos at&#13;
1978 prices to 19,102 million pesos at 1981 prices, an increase in value of 10&#13;
percent. The economic growth target for 1981 was initially set at 4 percent&#13;
and then revised (to account for the wholesale price reform) to 8 percent,&#13;
suggesting a rate of inflation of about 4 percent. /30 The rate of inflation&#13;
in 1982 should be quite significant as a result of the retail price reform of&#13;
December 1981.&#13;
Based on the above information, we can estimate roughly the following&#13;
average annual rates of inflation: for the period 1963-66, 5 to 6 percent;&#13;
1967-70, higher than during the previous period; 1971-75, much slower rate of&#13;
inflation; 1976-80, 0.9 percent; and 1981-82, very significant increase in the&#13;
inflation rate.&#13;

3.4 Price Reform&#13;
The need for a general price reform was discussed in the first half&#13;
of the 1970s and scheduled for implementation at the end of the five-year plan&#13;
1976-80.  As a Cuban technician noted in early 1980,&#13;
"In order for incentives to work, it is necessary that&#13;
prices reflect real costs and profit. Under the present&#13;
conditions, prices ....fluctuate over and below costs without&#13;
any economic reason; hence, any action to stimulate production&#13;
or quality will have little effect.... Soon there will be a&#13;
reform of wholesale industrial prices, as well as of prices of&#13;
procurement, construction and technical services. Although&#13;
this reform will not result in scientifically set prices, at&#13;
least the new prices will be much better than the actual&#13;
ones." /31&#13;
Addressing the need for the reform of retail prices the party newspaper stated&#13;
at about the same time: "Despite inflation all over the world, which has a&#13;
particular effect on such an open economy as Cuba's, retail [rationed] prices&#13;
of basic items have remained frozen at the levels of the early years of the&#13;
Revolution. The objective was not to hurt the household economy, but this has&#13;
meant large state subsidies that go against the necessary equilibrium in&#13;
internal financing." /32 In January 1981, a wholesale price reform was&#13;
introduced but detailed information on it has not been made available. A&#13;
retail price reform was partly implemented in December 1981 (it is discussed&#13;
below). The entire reform of prices is not expected to be completed until the&#13;
next five-year plan (1986-90).&#13;
The retail price reform enacted in December of 1981, increased the&#13;
prices of 1,510 consumer goods, including most essential foodstuffs and&#13;

manufactures. Price raises ranged from 7 to 525 percent; the overall average&#13;
price increase was 65 percent (see Table 23). Price increases were also&#13;
imposed on hotel lodging (11 to 84 percent), restaurant meals (11 to 30&#13;
percent) and postage (67 percent). Although the price inceases will move in&#13;
the direction of bringing prices of consumer goods closer to their real cost,&#13;
as noted above, state subsidization of consumers will continue during the&#13;
five-year plan 1981-85.&#13;
4. Exchange Rates&#13;
As other CPEs, Cuba practices a monopoly of foreign exchange. The&#13;
central bank (National Bank) exercises complete control over all foreign&#13;
exchange transactions and has exclusive authority to deal in foreign exchange;&#13;
it decides the type of currency to be used in foreign transactions (for&#13;
transactions exceeding 50,000 pesos) as well as the exchange rate for the&#13;
peso. /33&#13;
Trade, credit and other financial dealings between Cuba and CMEA&#13;
nations are generally conducted using the transferable ruble. /34 There&#13;
isscattered information to suggest that at least part of certain transactions&#13;
with CMEA members may be conducted using convertible currencies, but it is not&#13;
possible to gauge how significant Cuba-CMEA transactions in convertible&#13;
currencies might be. While there is no systematic information on the total&#13;
volume of Cuba's external financial dealings, or on the portion conducted with&#13;
CMEA nations, it is clear from data in Table 24 that the largest, and growing,&#13;

share of Cuba's external trade is conducted with CMEA nations. Thus in 1978,&#13;
almost 82 percent (by value) of Cuba's exports went to CMEA nations, while&#13;
these same nations provided roughly 77 percent of Cuba's imports. In 1980&#13;
(due to Cuba's trade shifts to take advantage of high sugar prices in the&#13;
international market) the proportions declined to 67 percent (exports) and 75&#13;
percent (imports). The Cuban peso-ruble exchange rate was apparently&#13;
unchanged during 1960-78 at 0.90 pesos for one ruble. /35&#13;
To the best of our knowledge, there is only one peso-U.S. dollar&#13;
(i.e., convertible currency) official exchange rate, used both for commercial&#13;
and non-commercial transactions. From 1914 to 1971 the Cuban peso was&#13;
exchanged at par with the U.S. dollar, but since 1961 the peso has not been&#13;
freely exchanged in international markets. According to Pick's Currency&#13;
Yearbook, the peso was linked in 1961 to the pound sterling for trade&#13;
purposes; with the floating of the U.S. dollar in 1971, the value of the peso&#13;
appreciated vis-a-vis the dollar through its link with the pound (see&#13;
Table 25). /36 According to the same source, the link with the pound was&#13;
broken in 1974 and since June 15, 1976, the peso has been placed on a&#13;
controlled floating basis. /37 This is confirmed by a statement by the BNC in&#13;
1981 indicating that "the official rate of exchange [is] based on the market&#13;

fluctuation of a basket of currencies which account for the bulk of [Cuba's]&#13;
international transactions." /38 The official exchange rate of the peso was&#13;
not changed after the wholesale price reform of 1981 but it was modified for&#13;
domestic (planning, accounting, statistical) purposes. /39&#13;
There is no information available on the composition of the currency&#13;
basket which determines the official peso-dollar exchange rate. Assuming that&#13;
the basket reflects Cuba's export receipts from the non-ruble area, the&#13;
following convertible currencies may be represented: French francs, Swedish&#13;
kronor, Italian lire, Deutsche mark, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling,&#13;
Swiss francs, Spanish pesetas, Canadian dollars and Japanese yen. /40 For the&#13;
period 1971-81, the peso-dollar exchange rate was most closely correlated with&#13;
deutsche mark-dollar (R2 = .962) and the yen-dollar (R2 = .830) exchange&#13;
rates; changes in the peso-dollar exchange rate were only closely correlated&#13;
with changes in the deutsche mark-dollar exchange rate (R2 = .631).&#13;
Though it is widely accepted that the official exchange rate vis-a-&#13;
vis the dollar far overstates the purchasing power of the peso, there is&#13;
virtually no information on the extent of the overvaluation. Pick's Currency&#13;
Yearbook reports black market Cuban peso exchange rates (Table 26) resulting&#13;
from unauthorized dealings of foreign currency banknotes and/or unlicensed&#13;
transfers abroad which suggest a wide difference between official rates and&#13;
purchasing power. Thus, according to this source, in 1979 the average black&#13;

market exchange rate was 14.17 pesos to the dollar compared with the official&#13;
rate of 0.725 pesos to the dollar. A less severe overvaluation of the peso is&#13;
suggested by a CIA study published in 1976. In that study the CIA reports&#13;
that the official exchange rate (for 1976) was 1 peso equal to $1.21; the CIA&#13;
adjusted "the 1957 (free market) exchange rate by the estimated relative&#13;
movements of the U.S. and Cuban GNP deflators from 1957-74" and obtained an&#13;
adjusted exchange rate of 1 peso equal to $0.90, or 34.4 percent lower than&#13;
the official rate. /41 Unfortunately, the report does not elaborate on how&#13;
the adjustment was effected.&#13;
5. Summary and Evaluation&#13;
As we noted at the beginning of this study, Cuban data on the MPS&#13;
published by the State Committee on Statistics (CEE) are scanty, highly&#13;
aggregated, frequently revised and affected by numerous methodological changes&#13;
which usually are not described. Data on NMP are available only for 1962-66&#13;
and on GMP for 1962-75 and 1977-78, mostly at current prices. No time series&#13;
data have ever been published on the value of nonmaterial services (NMS).&#13;
Data on GSP are available for 1962-81 but are of limited use because of&#13;
methodological changes that result in four different subseries which cannot be&#13;
connected. Quantity indexes of industrial production are not available&#13;
either.&#13;
Several organizations (such as the CIA, the ACDA, the World Bank and,&#13;
more recently, the Cuban government) have attempted to convert Cuban MPS data&#13;
to the SNA. In Section 2 of this paper we critically surveyed the methodo-&#13;

logies used by each of these institutions and presented their results. In the&#13;
same Section we also presented two additional estimates of Cuban GDP obtained&#13;
by (1) "scaling up" from GMP and (2) using the physical indicators approach.&#13;
Table 27 reports all the estimates of GSP/GMP/GNP/GDP per capita&#13;
surveyed in this study. Differences among these estimates in terms of&#13;
concept, method, prices and currency are very significant. Table 28 selects&#13;
the estimates for some potential benchmark years (1965, 1970, 1975, 1980).&#13;
For the years 1970 and 1975, the only comparable estimates are those of the&#13;
ACDA and the World Bank (GNP at current prices, in dollars); although these&#13;
two estimates are fairly close for 1970, they are significantly different for&#13;
1975. Our estimates of GDP (at current prices, in3dollars) using the PI&#13;
method are reasonably close to the ACDA estimates in 1965 and to both the ACDA&#13;
and World Bank estimates for 1970, but all three diverge notably in 1975 and&#13;
1977. Our analysis has pointed out many of the flaws which these estimates&#13;
suffer. In our judgement, none of these estimates can be used as reliable&#13;
indicators of Cuban GDP per capita for the benchmark years.&#13;

Table 29 reports all GSP/GMP/GNP/GDP per capita growth rates&#13;
estimates surveyed in this study. Differences among those estimates are&#13;
compounded by the different periods to which they refer. In Table 30 we have&#13;
selected only those estimat-es which span the benchmark years. In attempting&#13;
to compare the growth rate estimates, we confront the problem of differences&#13;
in concepts, methods, prices and currencies. For the period 1965-70 there are&#13;
no truly comparable growth rate estimates, although the ACDA and the PI&#13;
estimates (respectively of GNP and GDP, both at current prices in dollars) are&#13;
not too far apart. However, for 1970-75 differences between these estimates,&#13;
as well as between them and the World Bank estimates, are enormous: the&#13;
average growth rate fluctuates from 1 to 14.8 percent in that period. No&#13;
comparisons are possible for 1975-77 or 1975-80. Once again our judgment is&#13;
that none of the available growth rate estimates are reliable.&#13;
It is frustrating to end this study on such a negative note. And yet&#13;
our work has made several positive contributions: gathering all available&#13;
Cuban national product data and estimates under the MPS and the SNA,&#13;
critically analyzing their meaning and flaws, and evaluating the various&#13;
methods for the estimation of GDP. Although we cannot point to any reliable&#13;
estimates of GDP per capita and its growth rates we can, at least, suggest&#13;
which methods offer the best promise in the immediate future.&#13;
Unquestionably, the ideal method of estimating Cuban GDP/capita would&#13;
be a full-fledged MPS/SNA conversion following the United Nations technique.&#13;
Since Cuba's State Committee on Statistics has already done such conversion&#13;
for the year 1974, it would be feasible for CEE to repeat it for the years&#13;
1975 and 1980 (the conversion for 1970 would be more complex). There is some&#13;
evidence that Cuba might plan to move in this direction. Humberto Perez,&#13;

President of Cuba's Central Planning Board speaking at the MPS/SNA conversion&#13;
seminar held in Havana in May 1982 stated that ".... the recommendations of&#13;
this seminar will be studied in our country with the objective of their&#13;
immediate implementation." /42 An alternative short-cut method would be to&#13;
scale up from GMP using estimates of the value of NMS for the benchmark years&#13;
but, again, additional data from Cuba would be needed on GMP (after 1974) and&#13;
on the value of NMS.&#13;
Estimates of Cuban GDP which would result from either of the two&#13;
methods suggested above would be in current prices and in pesos. Therefore,&#13;
in order to make meaningful international comparisons they would need to be&#13;
converted into estimates at constant prices and in dollars. This would&#13;
require accurate measures on Cuban inflation and a meaningful rate of exchange&#13;
between the peso and the U.S. doilar (or any other convertible currency).&#13;
Although the official view is that Cuba's MPS data are mostly in&#13;
constant prices (due to the freeze on prices of rationed goods in effect since&#13;
1962) we have argued in Section 3 that an important, and growing, part of the&#13;
Cuban economy is affected by inflation. The expansion of the "parallel" and&#13;
"free peasant markets," and the dramatic rise in consumer-good prices at the&#13;
end of 1981, are evidence of the increasing relevance of inflation in the&#13;
Cuban economy.&#13;
As we have noted in Section 4, the Cuban central bank controls all&#13;
foreign exchange transactions and determines the exchange rate for the peso.&#13;
Since 1961, the Cuban peso has not been freely exchanged in international&#13;

markets. To the best of our knowledge there is only one peso-U.S. dollar&#13;
(i.e., convertible currency) exchange rate used both for commercial and&#13;
noncommercial transactions. Reportedly, in 1961 the peso was linked with the&#13;
pound sterling for trade purposes; by virtue of this link the peso appreciated&#13;
by 21 percent with respect to the U.S. dollar during 1971-74. Since 1976 the&#13;
peso has been placed on a controlled floating basis, but there is no&#13;
information on the composition of the currency basket which determined the&#13;
peso-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Between 1976 and 1980, the peso appreciated&#13;
by an additional 20 percent with respect to the dollar. Although it is widely&#13;
accepted that the official exchange rate far overstates the purchasing power&#13;
of the peso, there is no reliable information on the extent of the&#13;
overvaluation which would permit the estimation of an alternative exchange&#13;
rate.&#13;

Appendix A&#13;
Cuban National Product Definitions&#13;
Official Cuban statistical sources have only once presented the&#13;
methodology for calculating the national product under the MPS. In the 1972&#13;
statistical yearbook, published by the Central Planning Board (Junta Central&#13;
de Planificacion, JUCEPLAN), aggregation formulae for the gross material&#13;
product (GMP) and the global social product (GSP) were reported. These&#13;
formulae are reproduced below as equations (1) and (2). Since earlier, in the&#13;
1966 statistical yearbook, it had been reported that depreciation accounted&#13;
for the difference between the net material product (NMP) and GMP (equation&#13;
3), it is possible to combine equations (1) - (3) to define NMP in terms of&#13;
its components (equation 4). Thus,&#13;
(1) Cp + Cc = I + S + (X - M) = GMP&#13;
(2) GMP + Ci = GSP&#13;
(3) GMP - D = NMP&#13;
(4)  Cp + Cc + (I - D) + S + (X    M) = NMP&#13;
where Cp = personal consumption&#13;
Cc = collective or social consumption&#13;
I    = gross fixed capital formation ("gross state investment")&#13;
S    = variations in stocks&#13;
X    = exports&#13;
M      imports&#13;
GMP = gross material product (also called "gross product" and "gross&#13;
internal product")&#13;
Ci   = intermediate consumption ("intermediate material inputs")&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
GSP = global social product&#13;
D    = consumption of fixed capital ("depreciation")&#13;
NMP = net material product ("national income")&#13;
Presumably these definitions have remained unchanged even after the State&#13;
Committee on Statistics (Comite Estatal de Estadisticas, CEE) was established&#13;
in 1976 and charged with producing the national product statistics.&#13;
Personal consumption (C p) includes all expenditures by household&#13;
units on goods and material services, such as purchases of goods sold.in state&#13;
retail stores and free peasant markets, fees paid for public utilities and&#13;
transportation, cost of home repair, consumption of state-subsidized meals,&#13;
housing depreciation, private farmers' self consumption, etc. Also included&#13;
as personal consumption is material consumption by units of the nonmaterial&#13;
sphere serving individuals. Collective or social consumption (Cc) refers to&#13;
consumption done by institutions which satisfy collective needs. The sum of&#13;
personal and social consumption results in "total [final] consumption."&#13;
Gross fixed capital formation or gross investment (I) refers to all&#13;
expenditures by the state in fixed assets. Subtraction of consumption of&#13;
fixed capital or depreciation (D) from I yields net fixed capital formation or&#13;
net investment. Both gross and net investment exclude replacement of fixed&#13;
assets due to losses. Variations in stocks (S) refer to increases or&#13;
decreases in inventories of raw materials, fuels, spare parts, tools, etc.,&#13;
and may include changes in material circulating assets. The sum of gross&#13;
investment and variations in capital stocks results in "capital accumulation."&#13;
Exports (X), fob basis, and imports (M), cif basis, include all sales&#13;
and purchases abroad of goods and services, as well as gifts of material goods&#13;
granted or received from abroad. Transactions of nonproductive services are&#13;
excluded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
The "disposable product" is defined as the sum of total consumption&#13;
and capital accumulation. The sum of the disposable product and net exports&#13;
(X - M) yields the GMP. "Global demand" is obtained by adding exports to the&#13;
disposable product, while the "global supply" is defined as the sum of GMP and&#13;
imports.&#13;
Intermediate consumption or intermediate material inputs (Ci)&#13;
embraces all expenditures in raw materials, fuels, electricity, losses,&#13;
productive services, transportation and communications involved in material&#13;
production and distribution. The sum of GMP and intermediate consumption is&#13;
the GSP.&#13;
From the product side, the GSP consists of the value of goods and&#13;
material services generated by the productive sphere. It includes estimates&#13;
of the value of private farmers' self-consumption and sales to free peasant&#13;
markets, the value of transportation created by private truckers and taxi&#13;
drivers, the material value created by the self-employed and, at least since&#13;
1973, the value of the product of the private agricultural sector linked to&#13;
the state sector (which is practically all). Official Cuban GSP statistics&#13;
exclude the value of the following nonmaterial services: personal and&#13;
communal services and housing; education, culture and art; public health and&#13;
social security, recreation, sports and tourism; science and technology;&#13;
finance, credit and insurance; and defense and state administration.&#13;
Thus, the Cuban national product accounting system follows closely the&#13;
MPS and is consistent with those used by the USSR and other CPEs and described&#13;
in various United Nations publications. In fact, several reports of the&#13;
National Bank refer to the MPS methodology described by the United Nations in&#13;
Basic Principles of the System of National Balances of the National Economy.&#13;

Unofficial Material Product Indexes&#13;
Quantity indexes of Cuban material product (MP) for the periods 1959-&#13;
1961, 1961-1968 and 1968-1980 have been calculated by independent researcher&#13;
Claes Brundenius relying heavily on Cuban official data. /43 Brundenius&#13;
defines the MP as the combined output of the industrial, agricultural and&#13;
construction sectors. Year-to-year percent changes in Cuban MP estimated by&#13;
Brundenius are reported in Table B-1.&#13;
The MP quantity index developed by Brundenius for the period 1959-&#13;
1961 is actually an extension of an unofficial industrial production index for&#13;
pre-revolutionary Cuba developed by one of the authors of this study, /44&#13;
supplemented with an index of Cuban agricultural output from the United&#13;
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and estimates of construction&#13;
activity based on cement production. The industrial production index is of&#13;
the Laspeyres type, with product prices for 1952 and weights corresponding to&#13;
each sector's contribution to gross value added in 1953; approximately 40&#13;
industrial output series were considered in the original work, and most of&#13;
these were also included in Brandenius' extension.&#13;

The index sub-series for the period 1961-1968 follows a different&#13;
methodology. Since over this period official data on gross value added by&#13;
material product sectors at constant (1965) prices are available, Brundenius&#13;
calculated indexes for each of the sectors directly from the published data&#13;
and arrived at the final measure by weighing each of the sectors according to&#13;
their contribution to gross value added in 1965.&#13;
Because constant-price value of output data are not available beyond&#13;
1968, the 1968-1980 index of material product was constructed as a Laspeyres&#13;
index with 1965 retail prices (actually the prices used by the author referred&#13;
to 1978; however, he assumed that they were also applicable to 1965 since&#13;
official retail prices were fixed over the period) and weights corresponding&#13;
to value added in 1968. Since the available price data referred to retail&#13;
prices, as a rule limited to consumer products, Brundenius was forced to alter&#13;
his methodology to consider sectors producing basic and intermediate&#13;
products. He did this by relying on the official indexes of output (which, as&#13;
noted previously, are value series) as proxies for quantity indexes for basic&#13;
and intermediate products sectors; for mining, export prices were used.&#13;
Because the 1968-1980 material product index is, in effect, a hybrid,&#13;
developed using a quantity index methodology for some sectors and value&#13;
indexes for others, its usefulness as a proxy for MP independent of the&#13;
problems which plague GSP data is questionable. Had Brundenius been able to&#13;
construct a "true" quantity index, changes in this measure would have been&#13;
helpful in shedding some light on the extent to which valuation changes affect&#13;
GSP.&#13;

World Bank Atlas Estimates of Cuban GDP/Capita in U.S. Dollars&#13;
In 1966, the World Bank published the first issue of the World Bank&#13;
Atlas containing estimates of population, GNP in dollars and GNP/capita in&#13;
dollars for 136 countries, including Cuba, for 1964. Since then, 17&#13;
additional issues of the Atlas updating the data, expanding the country&#13;
coverage and refining the estimation methodologies have been published. GNP&#13;
and GNP/capita estimates for Cuba were included in each of the issues of the&#13;
Atlas through the 1980 edition. These estimates constitute the only long-term&#13;
series of U.S. dollar GNP/capita estimates for Cuba available anywhere and,&#13;
therefore, have been widely used by journalists, scholars, and government&#13;
officials interested in the performance of the Cuban economy in the&#13;
revolutionary period. Estimates of Cuban GDP and GDP/capita have been omitted&#13;
beginning with the 1981 Atlas, released in early 1982.&#13;
Efforts to analyze the methodology used by the World Bank to produce&#13;
the U.S. dollar GNP/capita estimates for Cuba in the Atlas are hindered by the&#13;
lack of documentation. A technical note, included since the third issue (the&#13;
1968 Atlas) is of limited value in determining the procedures utilized to make&#13;
the Cuban estimates. Presumably, throughout the first eight editions of the&#13;
Atlas (1966-1973), estimates for Cuba were made along the line of estimates&#13;
for other CPEs. With the ninth issue (the 1974 Atlas), estimates for the&#13;
Eastern European CPEs began to be made using the physical indicators approach;&#13;
there is no information on methodology used for the non-European CPEs,&#13;
however. Beginning with the eleventh edition of the Atlas (1976), it is&#13;
explicitly noted that for Albania, Cuba and the Asian CPEs available&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
information is fragmentary and "different methods of estimation are used in&#13;
each case." The nature of these methods is not given in the technical note.&#13;
World Bank officials have been able to provide relatively little&#13;
information on the methodology used for the Cuban GNP/capita estimates. World&#13;
Bank files contained documentation only on the estimates made for the 1979&#13;
Atlas and the 1980 Atlas. An interview with the staff member within the&#13;
Economic Analysis and Projections Department with direct responsibility for&#13;
making estimates for Cuba and other CPEs for the Atlas provides little&#13;
additional information since he took over this task relatively recently.&#13;
Subject to the above-noted limitations, this Appendix reviews the&#13;
U.S. dollar GNP/capita for Cuba in the Atlas and, where possible, analyzes the&#13;
methodology used.&#13;
1966-71 Atlas&#13;
Estimates of Cuban U.S. dollar GNP/capita for the period 1960-69&#13;
included in the first six issues of the Atlas can be treated together as they&#13;
appear to refer to the same concept: net material product /45 at factor&#13;
prices converted to U.S. dollars using official exchange rates. Presumably,&#13;
the same methodology was used to produce the Cuban estimates for each year&#13;
during this period. The left panel of Table C-1 reproduces the estimates fo.r&#13;
1964-69 as reported in the Atlas, as well as estimates for other years&#13;
/45 The prefatory statement to the first issue of the Atlas (1966) states&#13;
that "for certain Sino-Soviet countries the data relate to net material&#13;
product." In the 1968 Atlas the term "Sino-Soviet countries" was substi-&#13;
tuted by "centrally planned (socialist) economies."&#13;

obtained by extrapolating from the given estimates with multi-year rates of&#13;
growth also reported. /46&#13;
As mentioned above, the World Bank was unable to provide information&#13;
on how these estimates were made. Purely as an exercise in speculation, we&#13;
have made some rough estimates of Cuban GNP/capita in U.S. dollars, presented&#13;
in the right panel of Table C-1, using an approach which may be close to that&#13;
used by the World Bank.&#13;
Column 1, right panel of Table C-1, reports official Cuban data on&#13;
GNP/capita in dollars during 1955-58; conversion to U.S. dollars has been made&#13;
at the official rate of 1 peso = 1 US dollar. Column 2 presents estimates of&#13;
GNP/capita in dollars for 1959-67 obtained by using the 1958 figure as the&#13;
base and applying estimates of per capita growth rates from different sources&#13;
(indicated in the table). Column 3 further estimates GNP/capita for 1963-69 -&#13;
using the estimated GNP/capita figure for 1962 as the base and annual changes&#13;
in official Cuban GMP adjusted for population growth.&#13;
Comparison of the World Bank and alternate estimates suggests several&#13;
striking similarities and differences. First, the alternate method produces&#13;
exactly the same estimate for Cuban per capita GNP for 1964 ($360) reported in&#13;
the 1966 Atlas. Second, the alternate method produces virtually the same&#13;
estimate of per capita GNP for 1960 ($371) as that obtained by extrapolation&#13;
/46 According to the Technical Note, the growth rates are average annual&#13;
growth rates computed fitting a trend line to the logarithmic value of&#13;
GNP/capita for each of the years. This method assures that all&#13;
observations are considered and the growth rates obtained reflect general&#13;
trends rather than cyclical factors or irregular variations in any&#13;
particular year. The extrapolations have been carried out by applying&#13;
the average growth rate for each year, therefore missing year-to-year&#13;
deviations around the average growth rate. Thus, considerable caution&#13;
should be exercised in using the extrapolated estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
using figures from the 1971 Atlas ($372). Third, the alternate per capita GNP&#13;
estimate for 1967 ($338) is in line with that reported in the 1969 Atlas&#13;
($330). However, the alternate method produces per capita GNP estimates for&#13;
1968 and 1969 substantially higher than those in the 1970 Atlas and 1971 Atlas&#13;
($355 versus $310 for 1968 and $335 versus $280 for 1969). This results&#13;
primarily from the use in the alternate method of positive per capita GNP&#13;
changes for 1967 (0.5 percent) and especially 1968 (5.0 percent).&#13;
Although the comparisons above are inconclusive, it appears&#13;
reasonable that Cuban per capita GNP estimates in the 1966-71 Atlas were made&#13;
using methodology similar to the alternate method.&#13;
1972-80 Atlas&#13;
Beginning with the 1972 Atlas, which reports estimates for 1970, per&#13;
capita GNP estimates for all countries are (i) based on market prices; and&#13;
(ii) converted to U.S. dollars using official exchange rates for a multi-year&#13;
(1965-71) period. Because of these changes, GNP per capita estimates in the&#13;
1970 Atlas and later issues cannot be compared with those in the 1966-71&#13;
editions. In explaining the distinction between GNP at factor cost and at&#13;
market prices, the technical note points out that market prices include&#13;
indirect taxes and thus relates more closely to the value of goods and&#13;
services as they are sold in the market place. The note further states that&#13;
as a result of the shift to GNP at market prices concept, estimates for all&#13;
countries rose by an average of 20 percent compared to those at factor cost&#13;
published in earlier issues; it is also stated that the impact on GNP per&#13;
capita growth rates is minimal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
For Cuba, the effect of the shift in GNP valuation /47 from factor&#13;
costs to market prices is quite acute: GNP per capita jumps from $280 in 1969&#13;
to $530 in 1970, or by 89 percent. How was this change from factor cost to&#13;
market prices effected for Cuba since there are no data available on indirect&#13;
taxes? Though the World Bank has been unable to shed any light on this&#13;
question, we can speculate on how the estimates at market prices might have&#13;
been made.&#13;
The left panel of Table C-2 compares World Bank GNP per capita&#13;
estimates at factor cost and at market prices for the period 1960-1970; these&#13;
series have been obtained through extrapolation from the 1969 Atlas (for the&#13;
series at factor cost) and 1970 Atlas (for the series at market prices) and&#13;
the reported growth rates. The right panel reports official Cuban GMP data&#13;
(for 1962-1966 in constant 1965 prices and for 1967-70 in current prices) as&#13;
well as simple estimates of GNP (obtained by inflating GMP by 10 percent /48)&#13;
and population figures for the period 1962-70. The last column reports&#13;
GNP/capita calculated from the estimated GNP and population figures.&#13;
Comparison of the GNP/capita estimates in the right panel of Table        with&#13;
the World Bank estimates of GNP/capita at market prices reported in, or&#13;
extrapolated from, the 1972 Atlas reveals that they are very close and&#13;
suggests that the very simple methodology described above may have been the&#13;
basis for the Atlas estimates at market prices. GNP/capita estimates were&#13;
/47 It is unlikely that the use of a multi-year base period for exchange&#13;
rates would have had any effect on the estimates since the official peso&#13;
to dollar exchange rate remained unchanged during this period.&#13;
/48 This technique for converting GMP to GNP appears to be used commonly in&#13;
the Atlas; for example, it is used in making the Cuban estimates in the&#13;
1980 Atlas.&#13;

also made using GMP data at current prices for 1962-1966 but were not included&#13;
because they were not as close to the Atlas estimates as those based on GMP at&#13;
constant prices.&#13;
Examination of the Atlas GNP/capita estimates for Cuba for the 1970s&#13;
in Table C-3 suggests that several different methodologies might have been&#13;
used. As a result, estimates vary widely depending on the issue of the&#13;
Atlas. Documentation on the estimation methodology only exists for the 1979&#13;
Atlas and 1980 Atlas, however.&#13;
As noted above, the 1970 estimate of per capita GNP at market prices&#13;
may have been made using official GMP data, multiplied times a fixed factor to&#13;
approximate GMP. The estimates for succeeding years do not appear to have&#13;
been based on the same approach, however, as official Cuban GMP data for the&#13;
first half of the 1970s showed consistent growth while the Atlas reported&#13;
quite a different pattern. Thus, while the 1977 Atlas estimates that for the&#13;
period 1970-75 GNP/capita rose by approximately 5 percent, the corresponding&#13;
change using the official GMP data (adjusted is roughly 94 percent.&#13;
The 1979 Atlas estimated GNP/capita for 1977 and 1978 as follows:&#13;
first, the ACDA estimate of Cuban GNP at current prices for 1975 ($5,318&#13;
million) was used as a base (see Table 16). This figure was divided by an&#13;
estimate of Cuban population in mid 1975 (9.3 million) made by the United&#13;
Nations, thus obtaining the GNP/capita in current dollars of 1975 ($676).&#13;
Second, it was assumed that there was no growth in GNP/capita during 1975-78,&#13;
so that GNP/capita in 1977 and 1978 would also be $676 in 1975 U.S. dollars.&#13;
Third, the estimates were converted to current 1978 dollars by adjusting to&#13;
account for inflation in the U.S. during 1977-78 relative to 1975. This was&#13;
done by using the U.S. GNP deflator, which was 1.113 in 1977 and 1.196 in&#13;

1978. Thus, the GNP/capita estimates in current dollars for 1977 is 1.113 x&#13;
$676 = $752 and for 1978, 1.196 x $676 = $808. These figures are rounded off&#13;
to $750 and $810 in the 1979 Atlas.&#13;
These calculations suffer from several flaws: (i) There is no&#13;
information on how the ACDA calculated GNP for 1975 or any other year; (ii)&#13;
The Atlas reported an average growth rate for 1970-1977 of -1.2 percent in&#13;
current dollars; we know, however, that 1971-1975 was a period of rapid growth&#13;
in Cuba; and (iii) The 1979 Atlas assumed no growth in Cuban GNP in 1977 and&#13;
1978 although Cuban official sources reported GSP growth rates of 4 and 11.2&#13;
percent, respectively, in those two years.&#13;
The GNP/capita estimates in the 1980 Atlas follow a markedly&#13;
different approach. First, a benchmark estimate for 1970 is developed as&#13;
follows:/49&#13;
1970 Gross Material Product (Official)&#13;
(in million pesos)                         4204  /50&#13;
Adding 10 percent to convert&#13;
GMP to GNP                                 4624&#13;
Using mid-year population estimate&#13;
of 8.58 million and exchange rate&#13;
of I peso - 1 U.S. dollar                    $539&#13;
Second, the World Bank notes correctly that GMP growth rates beyond 1974 are&#13;
not available and decides to use growth rates of industrial production as a&#13;
/49 This method is the same as we have used in Table C-2 to make estimates of&#13;
Cuban GDP/capita. In fact, our estimate of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars&#13;
for 1970 included in Table C-2 ($541) would be identical to the World&#13;
Bank benchmark of $539 except for slight differences in population&#13;
estimates.&#13;
/50 This is the same figure reported in Table 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
proxy for GMP growth rates. The rationale for this substitution is that in&#13;
other CPEs there has been found to be a broad equality between growth rates of&#13;
GMP and industrial output.&#13;
The World Bank relied on growth rates of Cuban industrial production&#13;
obtained from the CMEA Statistical Yearbook for the period 1970-1976 and are&#13;
identical to those which would have been obtained from official Cuban data.&#13;
(See Section 2.1.2 and Table 7.) Further, it is argued that data on the&#13;
growth of industrial output was not available beyond 1976; therefore, the&#13;
growth rate of industrial production for 1976 (3 percent) is also used for&#13;
subsequent years. In fact, data on Cuban industrial production are available&#13;
both from Cuban sources and from the CMEA Statistical Yearbooks; rates of&#13;
growth of Cuban industrial production for 1976-1979, which differ&#13;
significantly from the 3 percent growth rate used by the World Bank, are&#13;
reported in Table C-4.&#13;
Third, the industrial output growth rates were converted to per&#13;
capita terms by dividing by Cuban population growth rates. Fourth, the&#13;
resulting growth rates in GMP/capita were converted to GNP/capita growth rates&#13;
using the same relationship developed for Eastern European CPEs,&#13;
log A = 0.5398 + 0.6260 log B&#13;
where A is the growth rate of GNP/capita and B is the growth rate of&#13;
GMP/capita. Finally, the estimate of GNP/capita for 1979 at constant 1970&#13;
prices ($779) was converted into current prices using the U.S. GDP deflator&#13;
for 1979 with 1970 as the base. The resulting estimate of Cuban GDP/capita in&#13;
dollars for 1979 is $1410.   The World Bank also estimated that over the period&#13;

1970-1978. Cuban CDP/capita in dollars had grown at an annual average rate of&#13;
4.7 percent. 51/&#13;
Several points regarding the World Bank estimates of Cuban GDP/capita&#13;
in dollars in the 1980 Atlas can be made: 1) as noted in Table C-4, Cuban&#13;
industrial output grew somewhat faster in 1977-1979 than assumed by the World&#13;
Bank (12.3 percent v. 9.3 percent); 2) the Cuban industrial production indexes&#13;
are available only in current prices and hence the GNP/capita estimates cannot&#13;
be in "constant 1970 prices" since inflation has had some effect on the&#13;
indexes; 3) the population growth index used by the World Bank overstates&#13;
somewhat the official Cuban index; 4) the assumption that an industrial output&#13;
index is a good proxy for the growth in GMP, which may be reasonable for&#13;
European CPEs, may not be so for Cuba where agricultural production represents&#13;
an important (and volatile) proportion of total output; thus, as indicated in&#13;
Table C-4, growth rates of Cuban GMP/GSP were significantly higher than the&#13;
rates of growth of industrial output in most years during 1971-1979; and 5)&#13;
the use of the GMP/GDP conversion formula to estimate GDP/capita of Eastern&#13;
European CPEs has been criticized because it is argued that the proportion of&#13;
nonmaterial services in GDP may be higher in the more developed Western&#13;
European market economies than in the CPEs; if this were the case, GDP/capita&#13;
growth rates estimated for the CPEs would tend to overstate actual growth.&#13;
Arguably, the overestimation may be even higher in the case of Cuba where&#13;
nonmaterial services may be less significant compared to total GDP than in&#13;
more economically advanced nations.&#13;
/51 This high estimate of Cuban economic giowth during the 1970s gave rise to&#13;
a critical editorial in The Wall Street Journal. See, "Cuba's Incredible&#13;
Economy," The Wall Street Journal, December 30, 1981, p.6.&#13;

Appendix D&#13;
Estimating Cuban GDP/capita in Dollars Using the Physical&#13;
Indicators Approach&#13;
Because of limitations of Cuban macroeconomic data and the absence of&#13;
a meaningful peso-dollar exchange rate, we have explored the feasibility of&#13;
making estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars based on the physical&#13;
indicators (PI) approach. We have therefore attempted to make such estimates&#13;
using two well-known PI techniques, the univariate approach pioneered by&#13;
Janossy-Ehrlich, /52 and used extensively by the Economic Commission for&#13;
Europe (ECE). and the multivariate approach proposed by Beckerman and Bacon.&#13;
/53&#13;
1.   The ECE Physical Indicators (Univariate) Approach&#13;
In applying the univariate PI approach to make estimates of Cuban&#13;
GDP/capita in dollars, we have attempted, to the extent possible, to replicate&#13;
the work done in this area by the ECE (and the World Bank). /54 However, some&#13;
modifications have been made to reflect the nature of the Cuban economy and&#13;
data limitations. These deviations from the ECE methodology, as well as the&#13;

tentative results of our experimentation with the univariate PI approach, are&#13;
given below.&#13;
A significant difference between the ECE methodology and our work&#13;
refers to the sample of reference countries. The original ECE exercise which&#13;
attempted to estimate dollar GDP/capita for Eastern European nations and the&#13;
Soviet Union, used as reference 22 high-income industrial countries. More&#13;
recent work by the ECE introduced low-income countries into the analysis and&#13;
expanded the sample of countries to 75. /55 The introduction of low-income&#13;
countries yielded estimating equations substantially different in terms of&#13;
form and parameters than those obtained when the high-income countries alone&#13;
were used. After careful examination, the ECE concluded that the parameter&#13;
characteristics between the two sets of countries were so significant that the&#13;
estimating equations obtained from the larger sample were characteristic of&#13;
neither of the two groups. /56 Thus, the ECE preferred to continue to&#13;
estimate GDP/capita in dollars for the Eastern European countries and the&#13;
Soviet Union using the "homogeneous" original set of 22 high-income industrial&#13;
countries.&#13;
The 28 reference countries we have selected for estimating Cuban&#13;
GDP/capita are believed to be representative of the structure and level of&#13;
development of the Cuban economy during the 1960s and 1970s (see Table D-1).&#13;
The sample relies heavily on Latin American nations, which share many&#13;
structural characteristics with the Cuban economy: smallness, openness,&#13;

agricultural, reliant on exports of a few basic commodities. We have also&#13;
included selected European and Asian nations in order to increase the sample&#13;
size and buttress the number of countries at the upper end of the medium-&#13;
income scale to avoid the statistical problem of estimating outside of the&#13;
confidence interval. Cuban GDP/capita in dollars for 1958, the last year for&#13;
which such measure exists, is compared with that of the reference countries in&#13;
Table D-2.&#13;
Another departure in our work from the ECE methodology has to do with&#13;
the sample of physical indicators used. Our intention was to consider in our&#13;
work all 30 physical indicators used by the ECE in the revised exercise, but&#13;
this turned out to be impossible because of data limitations. After&#13;
considerable research, we were able to assemble relatively complete data for&#13;
24 physical indicators series for at least one of the four years under&#13;
consideration: 1965, 1970, 1975 and 1977 (see Table D-3). Our sample of&#13;
physical indicators suffers from several limitations. The lack of data is&#13;
particularly noticeable in the area of consumption of industrial products,&#13;
where only one reasonably complete series (steel consumption) could be found&#13;
compared to six in the revised ECE work. In some cases, the series we used&#13;
departed conceptually from those which would have been preferred: cement&#13;
production was used rather than cement consumption, and industrial consumption&#13;
of cotton was the only data series available which was reasonably close to&#13;
consumption of cotton textiles. For housing, virtually no data are available&#13;
except for a crude measure of persons per room in urban areas for circa&#13;
1970. Data in this area are apparently collected only in the context of&#13;
decennial population censuses, and inter-censal estimates are not available.&#13;

Estimates of Cuban GDP/capita obtained from the 24 PI relationships&#13;
are reported in Table D-4. Estimates marked with an asterisk result from&#13;
equations in which the correlation between the independent variable and&#13;
GDP/capita was not considered to be sufficiently strong (less than .50).&#13;
While the correlation coefficients varied widely across variables and time&#13;
periods, most of the equations retained exhibited correlation coefficients in&#13;
the .6 to .7 range, with a few (primarily those relating GDP/capita to energy&#13;
or electricity consumption per capita) exceeding .8. In general, the best-&#13;
fitting equation was obtained using a double-log specification, with the semi-&#13;
log and inverse specifications providing the best fit in a limited number of&#13;
cases.&#13;
The bottom three rows of Table D-4 present estimates of Cuban&#13;
GDP/capita in dollars for 1965, 1970, 1975 and 1977 obtained by averaging the&#13;
individual estimates. In the estimate reported in row A only those individual&#13;
estimates obtained from equations with relatively high correlations&#13;
coefficients, i.e., exceeding .5 were included; the estimated levels of Cuban&#13;
GDP/capita in dollars in the four years are:&#13;
1965:  $  480&#13;
1970:  $  616&#13;
1975:  $ 1127&#13;
1977:  $ 1355&#13;
Estimates in row B use the individual estimates obtained from statistically&#13;
strong relationships plus those from relationships not deemed to be strong,&#13;
and row C introduces an intermediate unweighted averaging step at the level of&#13;

each of the nine economic sectors. All three sets of estimates yield&#13;
approximately the same results and tend to support the ECE finding that the&#13;
overall estimates of GDP/capita obtained from the PI approach are fairly&#13;
insensitive to weighting scheme. The annual average growth rates implied by&#13;
the benchmark GDP/capita estimates (based on row A) are:&#13;
1965-70:   5.9 percent per year&#13;
1970-75: 12.1 percent per year&#13;
1975-77:   9.6 percent per year&#13;
2. The Physical Indicators Multivariate Approach&#13;
Recognizing that since some of the physical indicators (e.g.,&#13;
electricity consumption per capita and energy consumption per capita) are&#13;
highly correlated a smaller number of indicators could perform as well in&#13;
predicting GDP/capita, we have also experimented with the multivariate&#13;
technique, whereby only those physical indicators which add explanatory power&#13;
are used as independent variables. The Beckerman-Bacon multivariate approach&#13;
is conceptually similar to the univariate methods of the ECE, and has been&#13;
used to estimate GDP/capita in dollars for some CPEs.&#13;
Through a stepwise regression using the backward-elimination&#13;
procedure we have attempted to find the strongest subset of indicators which&#13;
could be used to explain the variability in GDP/capita for the reference&#13;
countries. The procedure starts with all independent variables (the set of 24&#13;
indicators) as explanatory variables and removes one at a time according to&#13;
its contribution to the overall explanatory power of the equation. Thus,&#13;
indicators which do not add explanatory power, or are redundant once other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
indicators have been included are eliminated. In the end, a small, but&#13;
statistically strong, set of explanatory variables is retained and the overall&#13;
estimation equation is highly significant (as indicated by the F-ratio). The&#13;
stepwise procedure was only performed with the linear specification.&#13;
The combinations of physical indicators which yielded the best fit,&#13;
and the adjusted R2, for each of the four years are the following:&#13;
1965:  ENEPC, TELPC              Ad. R 2 .887        F =   98.22&#13;
1970:  ENEPC, SUGPC, TELPC       Adj. R2 = .933       F = 111.52&#13;
1975:  ENEPC, CMTPC, PCRPC       Adj. R  2 .951       F = 154.74&#13;
1977:  ENEPC, TELPC              Adj. R2   .949       F - 231.83&#13;
The estimates of Cuban GDP/capita in dollars for each of the four years&#13;
obtained from the best-fit equations are:&#13;
1965:  $  494&#13;
1970:  $ 635&#13;
1975: $1,006&#13;
1977: $1,317&#13;
and the implied growth rates are 5.2 percent per annum for 1965-70, 9.6&#13;
percent for 1970-75 and 14.4 percent for 1975-77.&#13;

            This paper presents the results of a
            survey and critical analysis of Cuban national accounts
            data. The paper first reviews available Cuban data on the
            Material Product System (MPS), pointing out their strengths
            and limitations. Then it carries out a similar analysis with
            respect to gross domestic product (GDP) estimates based on
            the System of National Accounts (SNA) and discusses
            inflation in Cuba and the difficulties in establishing the
            proper peso/dollar exchange rate. The paper concludes with
            some judgments regarding the most promising method for
            establishing Cuban GDP per capita in dollars.
