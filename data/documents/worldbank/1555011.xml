EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA:&#13;
PAST TRENDS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS&#13;
This paper provides a brief overview of past economic developments&#13;
and future prospects in Eastern and Southern Africa. It answers questions&#13;
such as the following:   (i) why did growth in per capita income lag behind&#13;
that of other parts of the third world, (ii) why did current account deficits&#13;
on the balance of payments widen substantially, (iii) how did countries adjust&#13;
to changes in the international economic situation, (iv) what are the future&#13;
economic prospects of these countries, (v) what is the nature of the policy&#13;
change adopted or under consideration by several African governments, and (vi)&#13;
what changes in assistance policies of donors and creditors would support the&#13;
efforts of these economies to regain their development momentum.&#13;

EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA: PAST TRENDS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS&#13;
1.       The decade of the 1970s was full of severe strains.     While&#13;
progress was made on some fronts, it was made after overcoming formidable&#13;
obstacles. More recently many of these countries have encountered a&#13;
major deterioration in the international environment which has exposed&#13;
more clearly than before the fragility of their institutional framework&#13;
and weaknesses in economic policies. A number of countries have begun to&#13;
take stock of their situation and to initiate a process of policy reform&#13;
and structural change. To regain development momentum, it will be nec-&#13;
essary to sustain these processes during the 1980s by a combination of&#13;
local initiative and adequate support from abroad. Foreign aid agencies&#13;
need to review their policies and programs against the background of&#13;
the prevailing economic situation and prospects of African countries. To&#13;
facilitate the adjustment process of these countries, donors need to make&#13;
supporting adjustments in their programs and to adopt a near-term assist-&#13;
ance strategy. The last section of this paper spells out some of the&#13;
implications of such a strategy compared to the present practice of donors.&#13;
A. Past Trends&#13;
2.       Most countries in Africa are at the bottom of the development&#13;
pyramid. They have low per capita incomes and a very limited stock of&#13;
human capital or physical infrastructure. Exports are dominated by one or&#13;
two primary commodities, especially coffee, tea and copper, and because&#13;
world prices fluctuate widely, there are substantial disturbances introduced&#13;
from abroad in income, savings and public revenues. Natural calamities&#13;
take their toll as well, adding to economic instability. As the capacity&#13;
of those economies to adjust to disturbances is weak, development efforts&#13;
are interrupted frequently by financial difficulties. The pace of progress&#13;
during the 1970s was seldom smooth and there were marked inter-country&#13;
variations. Nevertheless, the decade was characterized by the following&#13;
general trends:&#13;
-    Income growth in African countries lagged behind that of all&#13;
LDCs. Furthermore, GDP expansion in low-income African&#13;
(those with per capita income less than $300 per capita in&#13;
1977 prices) countries was slower than that of low-income&#13;
Asian countries.&#13;
-   Population growth in Africa was accelerating while trends&#13;
in other LDCs suggested some slowing down.&#13;
-   The current account deficit on the balance of payments of&#13;
many African countries increased markedly in recent years&#13;
and budget deficits were growing as well. There was double&#13;
digit inflation in many countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
The following review is based on trends in Eastern and Southern Africa.&#13;
Changes in GDP&#13;
3.       Growth of income in Africa has lagged behind that of other LDCs.&#13;
(See Table 1.). Population growth, however, is growing at a faster rate.&#13;
Falling death rates, combined with continued high fertility, led to a&#13;
substantial acceleration in the rate of population growth. It is likely&#13;
that the peak in the pace of demographic expansion has not yet been&#13;
reached in most countries. Several countries now have population growth&#13;
rates exceeding 3 percent per annum. For these reasons, the falling&#13;
behind of African countries in terms of per capita income is even more&#13;
pronounced than the lag in GDP.    The average per capita income of low-&#13;
income African countries in 1970 was $182 compared to $151 in Asia (1977&#13;
prices). By 1980, this margin in favor of Africa will have completely&#13;
disappeared. It is likely that the average per capita income in low-&#13;
income Asia today is higher than in low-income Africa.&#13;
4.       The main explanation for lagging growth lies in the behavior of&#13;
the agricultural sector which looms large' in many countries. (See Table 2).&#13;
The long-run growth rate of agriculture production exceeded 3 percent per&#13;
year in six countries during the late sixties and early seventies. But&#13;
there were five cases in which agriculture output grew by one percent or&#13;
less during this period. What is even more startling and worrying is&#13;
that the pace of production slowed down almost everywhere during the middle&#13;
and later seventies. This deceleration is reflected both in food and&#13;
cash crop production. Over the entire period, food production per capita&#13;
seems to have declined in ten countries, which has resulted in substantial&#13;
increases in food imports. Eastern Africa witnessed a slowing down in the&#13;
rate of increase of food production at a time when the pace of population&#13;
growth was building up.&#13;
5.       The disappointing picture of agriculture is at the heart of the&#13;
development problem in Eastern Africa. To make agriculture a dynamic&#13;
sector requires a combination of ingredients - viable technical packages&#13;
adapted to local conditions, timely availability of key inputs, effective&#13;
extension services, a reasonable relation between prices paid and re-&#13;
ceived by farmers, availability of incentive consumer goods - and it has&#13;
not been possible to secure and sustain this combination in many places.&#13;
In addition, droughts, floods and pests took their toll; their incidence&#13;
was specially marked in 1973-75. The scarcity of project managers and&#13;
technicians reduced the effectiveness of delivery systems operating over&#13;
long distances and connected by weak transport networks. Most Governments&#13;
have tended to follow pricing policies aimed at keeping food prices low&#13;
in urban centers and have not always been fully convinced that attractive&#13;
prices will elicit increased production, despite substantial evidence to&#13;
the contrary.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
6.        Industry was very underdeveloped at independence and, despite&#13;
vigorous attempts on the part of Governments to promote this sector, pro-&#13;
gress made so far was fairly limited. Tanzania made a major policy switch&#13;
in 1967 in the form of the Arusha Declaration and Zambia followed with the&#13;
Mulungushi Reform in 1968.    In both cases, the role of state intervention&#13;
through parastatals and in other ways was greatly expanded. Similar&#13;
changes took place during the early seventies in Somalia, Sudan, Madagascar&#13;
and Ethiopia. Parastatals were plagued, in many cases, by conflicting in-&#13;
structions to earn profits but also to adhere to price controls, to&#13;
operate on a commercial basis but also to meet Government targets regard-&#13;
ing job creation. Trade policy and exchange rate regimes tended to bias&#13;
incentives in favor of production for the home market and, given discourag-&#13;
ing trends in farm income for much of the period, this market was not&#13;
growing very rapidly.&#13;
7.       In line with trends in the agriculture sector, the overall GDP&#13;
expanded fairly rapidly during the late 1960s. (See Table 3). Six&#13;
countries recorded rates of growth of 6 percent per annum or more. At&#13;
the opposite end of the spectrum, where were three countries in which&#13;
aggregate production barely kept pace with population. The second half&#13;
of the decade witnessed a widespread slowing down in economic growth,&#13;
compared to the earlier period. A factor contributing to the slowdown&#13;
was the incidence of border conflicts, revolution and internal strife dur-&#13;
ing this period. Perhaps the most dramatic illustration has been in the&#13;
case of Zambia, whose economy has suffered from a series of disruptions in&#13;
its routes to the sea. In 1970, 77 percent of its imports arrived via&#13;
Zimbabwe. After the border was closed in 1973, Zambia's most important route&#13;
to the sea passed through Angola accounting for 49 percent of Zambia's&#13;
total imports. Subsequently, in August 1975, the Angola route was&#13;
severed, and by 1977 Zambia was relying on the corridor through Tanzania&#13;
for 85 percent of its imports. All landlocked economies in Eastern Africa&#13;
suffered disruption in transport services and related border problems&#13;
during the past decade. Another disturbing factor was the disruption of&#13;
the East African Community. Created in 1967 to facilitate economic de-&#13;
velopment in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, the Community arrangements&#13;
collapsed in 1977, compelling erstwhile members to search for substitute&#13;
markets and leading to the closure of the Tanzania-Kenya border.&#13;
Growing Financial Pressure&#13;
8.       Although expansion of income slowed down, there was a marked&#13;
widening of the current account deficit of the balance of payments in&#13;
many countries. For low-income Africa the deficit rose from $249 million&#13;
in 1970 to an estimated $2,528 million in 1980 or from 1.8 percent to 5.4&#13;
percent of GDP. For some countries the corresponding proportion exceeded&#13;
10 percent; examples are Mauritius, Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya, Sudan. The&#13;
growing imbalance in external accounts was the combined result of the&#13;
following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
-   a substantial deterioration in the terms of trade,&#13;
-   a slowdown or decline in the volume of exports.&#13;
9.        Between 1966 and 1974 the regional terms of trade index (1977 = 100)&#13;
remained rather stable around an average of 153. (See Table 4). Between 1974&#13;
and 1975 it fell by 37 percent and has since remained at a new plateau&#13;
averaging 95 for the 1975-79 period. Major disturbances till 1973 were&#13;
caused by fluctuations in primary commodity export prices, while prices&#13;
of imports followed a slow upward trend. Since 1973 the pressure on the&#13;
balance of payments has been much accentuated by a very sharp upward trend&#13;
in import prices of capital goods and oil, while prices of Eastern African&#13;
exports continue to fluctuate in response to short-term market conditions.&#13;
Petroleum prices rose on average by 55 percent in 1979 and the cost of im-&#13;
porting oil pre-empted 22 percent of total exports on the average, compated&#13;
to 10 percent in 1970. (See Table 5).&#13;
10.      Changes in the terms of trade have had a major impact but they&#13;
are not the whole story by any means. The problem was accentuated by a&#13;
sharp setback in the volume of exports. (See Table 6). In at least seven&#13;
countries, the quantity of exports was declining during the later seventies.&#13;
The causes varied but prominent among them were overvaluation of the&#13;
currency, inadequate incentives for cash crops, infrastructure bottlenecks&#13;
and the like.&#13;
11.      The widespread deterioration in the balance of payments com-&#13;
pelled many countries to reduce very considerably the rate of growth of&#13;
imports.   (See Table 6).   In at least five cases, there was an absloute&#13;
decline in the volume of imports. It seems that in many cases the cur-&#13;
tailment of intermediate good imports was particularly sharp. This led&#13;
to a severe reduction in the utilization of existing capacity not only in&#13;
manufacturing but also in transport, construction, agricultural extension&#13;
services as well as education and health.&#13;
12.      The immediate reaction of many countries to the large deterioration&#13;
in their external position was to draw down reserves and borrow abroad.&#13;
Net foreign assets fell precipitously in 1975 and turned negative in&#13;
several countries. (See Table 6a). Most countries did not have much&#13;
access to the Eurodollar market but those few which could borrow commer-&#13;
cially did so. Examples are the sharp rise in foreign debt of Sudan,&#13;
Zaire, Zambia and Mauritius. The servicing of this debt in subsequent years&#13;
strained the balance of payments and in several cases arrears in payments&#13;
accumulated for the first time. These arrears amount to $1.8 billion in&#13;
Zaire, $1.2 billion in Sudan, $490 million in Zambia and $200 million in&#13;
Tanzania.&#13;
13.       Financial pressures were also manifest in the government budget.&#13;
Public expenditures have risen rapidly in many countries and they have&#13;
tended to outstrip revenues. Recourse to the banking system by govern-&#13;
ments, to finance budget deficits, were important causes of inflation in&#13;
many countries. Average annual price increases exceeded 10 percent in&#13;
most countries and reached as high as 50 percent in two instances. (See Table 7)&#13;

14.       Indirect taxation constitutes the bulk of public revenues and&#13;
the value of imports, expressed in local currency, is an important base&#13;
for such levies. The foreign exchange constraint in the late 1970s&#13;
dampened the rise in imports and the overvaluation of the currency ac-&#13;
centuated the erosion in this important tax base.&#13;
15.      On the expenditure side, several powerful factors have led to&#13;
large increases. A very high value was attached to social services in&#13;
the wake of national independence, and an impressive quantitative expansion&#13;
has taken place, particularly in the field of education. Eight countries&#13;
(Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Comoros, Swaziland, Tanzania,&#13;
Zambia) have already achieved primary school enrollment ratios exceeding 90&#13;
percent. The expansion of secondary education has been equally dramatic,&#13;
although the initial base was much narrower than that at the primary level.&#13;
Education outlays have risen much more rapidly than total government ex-&#13;
penditures. Altogether social services (education, health, etc.) absorb&#13;
30-35 percent of total public outlays in recent years in five countries&#13;
and more than 20 percent in the remaining countries. (See Table 8). More&#13;
broadly, capital expenditures have risen substantially as governments&#13;
formulated plans, identified projects and secured external funds from&#13;
donors and foreign banks or suppliers. (See Table 9).&#13;
16.      Attempts made by governments to control the budget deficit have&#13;
frequently led to a growing imbalance in the composition of expenditures.&#13;
If funds are scarce, a reasonable approach would be to assign priority&#13;
to the full utilization of already completed projects and speedy completion&#13;
of half-completed investments. New projects would be started, under these&#13;
circumstances, only to the extent that funds remained after meeting&#13;
priority needs. But this reasonable approach does not seem to have been&#13;
followed in practice in many cases. A strong preference has been shown&#13;
instead for starving existing roads of maintenance funds, existing vehicles&#13;
of spare parts and the existing school system of key inputs. In addition,&#13;
there are many examples of on-going projects which have failed to obtain&#13;
local budget funds required for effective implementation. And while com-&#13;
pleted and half completed investments have been starved of funds, govern-&#13;
ments have started new projects, frequently in collaboration with foreign&#13;
aid agencies. Present benefits from already completed projects and benefits&#13;
from half-completed projects which are within grasp in a matter of a year&#13;
or two have been sacrificed in order to start new schemes whose pay-off&#13;
would not materialize for five or six years.&#13;
17.      Attempts to control public expenditures did not lead governments&#13;
to reduce jobs in the public sector. On the contrary, there has been a&#13;
tendency to create new posts and thereby offset the slack in employment&#13;
opportunities in the private sector. This compensatory reaction is&#13;
understandable, given government sensitivity to urban unemployment among&#13;
secondary school graduates, but the impact of more employees on the payroll&#13;
(combined with less funds for supplies and provisions) on the productivity&#13;
of the public sector and the morale of the civil service was debilitating.&#13;

Scarcity of High and Medium-Level Manpower&#13;
18.      The foreign exchange and the budgetary position has been very&#13;
tight. Superimposed on these financial pressures has been the acute&#13;
scarcity of skilled and experienced manpower in the public sector. This&#13;
has affected adversely the functioning of the administrative machine.&#13;
Tasks such as macro-economic management, tax collection, licensing of&#13;
foreign exchange and agricultural extension services are subject to costly&#13;
delays and lapses. The malaise affects also the network of parastatals&#13;
which have heavy responsibilities in operating the infrastructure, agri-&#13;
cultural credit and marketing as well as industrial establishments in&#13;
many countries. The unavailability of key personnel is also a critical&#13;
bottleneck in the implementation of development projects.&#13;
19.      The manpower gap remains a conspicuous feature of the scene in&#13;
sub-Sahara Africa. The number of secondary school graduates has risen&#13;
substantially and a small trickle of professionals have also emerged but&#13;
the situation remains critical. Members of colonial services who remained&#13;
to work in Africa after independence have been replaced by indigenous&#13;
personnel to a large extent. Expatriates under foreign technical assistance&#13;
programs have provided a measure of relief but their use is subject to a&#13;
growing number of restrictions. Recent years have seen an outflow of&#13;
skilled and semi-skilled workers from countries such as the Sudan and&#13;
Somalia who are attracted by high wages and salaries in the Gulf countries.&#13;
B. Future Prospects for Low-income Africa&#13;
20.       Economic prospects for low-income African countries (below $300&#13;
per capita income in 1977 prices) depend both on how the international&#13;
economic situation evolves and the manner in which governments of these&#13;
countries respond to the circumstances facing them. As far as the external&#13;
environment is concerned, preliminary work done by Bank staff suggest the&#13;
following:&#13;
-   Average import prices will rise by 149 percent during 1977-85&#13;
led by fuel prices (270 percent), followed by food (115 percent)&#13;
and then capital goods (106 percent).&#13;
-4  By contrast, export prices will rise by only 66 percent on&#13;
average during the same period; prices of metals and mineral&#13;
exports by 159 percent, of agricultural raw materials by&#13;
121 percent while prices of food and beverages are expected&#13;
to decline by 8 percent.&#13;
-   Official development assistance declined from .44 percent of&#13;
the GNP of OECD countries in 1965 to .31 percent in 1977.&#13;
It is assumed that the proportion will climb up to .35 percent&#13;
in 1985. This implies a doubling of ODA from OECD members&#13;
in nominal terms during 1979-85. The aid of OPEC donors&#13;
was 2.7 percent of GNP in 1975 but there was a very sharp&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
fall subsequently. It is assumed that their assistance&#13;
will rise by 144 percent in nominal terms during the same&#13;
period.&#13;
The proportion of assistance from all sources going to low-&#13;
income Africa is assumed to rise from 9.1 percent in 1979&#13;
to 11.1 percent in 1985. On this basis, net disbursements&#13;
of ODA to these countries will rise from $2.5 billion to $6.2&#13;
billion in nominal terms during the same period.&#13;
21.      Altogether, the prospectsare for a substantial deterioration in&#13;
the terms of trade of low-income African countries. (See Table 10). The&#13;
index for the terms of trade of this region will decline from 100 in 1977&#13;
to 68 in 1980. No improvement is expected during the 1980s. The impact&#13;
of the adverse terms of trade will be offset partially by the rise in the&#13;
inflow of concessional assistance. Our calculations show that the extent&#13;
of the offset will be 48 percent in 1980; if donors behave as assumed in&#13;
para. 20, the resource gap (imports less exports) will rise by $2.7 billion,&#13;
purely because of assumed changes in export and import prices, starting&#13;
from a base of a three-year average i.e. 1975-77. The increase in ODA&#13;
will be $1.3 billion compared to the same base i.e. 48 percent of the in-&#13;
crease in the resource gap traceable to the change in the terms of trade.&#13;
This ratio of 48 percent in 1980 would rise gradually over the period&#13;
and reach 86 percent in 1985, if donors indeed expand ODA as assumed in&#13;
para. 20.&#13;
22.      This is a grim picture.    It implies that even if these low-income&#13;
countries succeed in carrying out major reforms in policies and institutions&#13;
and thereby reverse the 1970-77 decline in the volume of exports (as assumed&#13;
in Table 10), there will take place a substantial deterioration in their&#13;
capacity to import. These imports amounted to $8.2 billion (1977 prices)&#13;
per year on average in 1975-77.' Our calculations show that only $6.5 billion&#13;
(1977 prices) worth of imports can be purchased in 1980. This figure will&#13;
rise slowly to $7.6 billion in 1985.&#13;
23.      A great deal of effort will be required simply to stand still&#13;
Volume of imports during 1980-85 will remain 14 percent below the 1975-77&#13;
average, given the acute foreign exchange constraint. Under these&#13;
circumstances, it would be unrealistic to expect rapid growth in income&#13;
and Table 10 visualises an average annual rate of only 3.1 percent which&#13;
is barely ahead of the pace of population growth. Even this expansion&#13;
postulates a fair amount of import substitution, particularly of food. To&#13;
arrest the past decline in per capita food production will require major&#13;
reforms and new initiatives.&#13;
24.      Table 10 presents an aggregate picture for 18 countries and&#13;
draws attention to some of their common characteristics. It does not&#13;
focus on differences among them and this paper is not the place to spell&#13;
our these differences which are considerable. It should be pointed out,&#13;
nevertheless, that some countries have already initiated policy reforms&#13;
aimed at securing structural adjustments necessary for coping with economic&#13;
&#13;

circumstances in which they find themselves. For example, Kenya is taking&#13;
the following significant steps:&#13;
-   It has adopted a financial stabilization program in&#13;
collaboration with the IMF.&#13;
-   It will establish machinery for exercising control over&#13;
new external borrowing.&#13;
-   It has scaled down the expenditure targets of its Fourth&#13;
Plan in line with revised assessments of resources avail-&#13;
able and it will ensure that sufficient funds are available&#13;
for full utilization of completed investments as well as&#13;
for implementation of on-going projects. New projects will&#13;

tariffs and elimination of quantitative restrictions on&#13;
imports with a view to making industry more competitive in&#13;
world markets.&#13;
These measures constitute a reasonable approach to the adjustment problem&#13;
faced by Kenya. Further reforms will be necessary but a promising start&#13;
has been made. The Fourth Plan postulated a target of 6.3 percent per&#13;
annum in GDP. While this will not be feasible, it should be possible for&#13;
GDP to expand at an average rate of 4.0-5.0 percent per annum, consistent&#13;
with a reduction in the ratio of the deficit on the current account of&#13;
the balance of payments to GDP.&#13;
25.      Similar policy moves are under active consideration in several&#13;
other countries, although the process of reform is much further behind&#13;
than that in Kenya. The acuteness of the adjustment problem varies&#13;
greatly. Without identifying the countries in question, we will try to&#13;
characterise several types of situations. In Case A, the difficulties&#13;
are sizeable, but solutions will not be hard to find, provided there is&#13;
political stability and a willingness to make the required policy changes.&#13;
GDP could rise by 5 percent per annum or more during the adjustment period.&#13;
In Case B, the difficulties are enormous; the volume of exports have been&#13;
declining for many years, growth in agriculture has been disappointing and&#13;
the capital stock in this sector as well as transport has not been main-&#13;
tained. The budget deficit is 17 percent and the current account deficit&#13;
is 11 percent of GDP. It will take a bold set of pragmatic measures&#13;
just to slowdown the rate of deterioration and the turn-around may not&#13;
be feasible till 1985. Finally, in Case C, the situation is even more&#13;
awesome. GDP declined five years in a row and in 1979 it was 8 percent&#13;
below the average in the early 1970s. Meanwhile, inflation was raging at&#13;
more than 100 percent per annum in 1979 and the country only paid one-third&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
of its contracted debt service. The rehabilitation of the economy and the&#13;
resumption of normal development in Case C requires fundamental change in&#13;
both the policy-making process as well as in specific policies.&#13;
C. Future Prospects for Lower-Middle Income Africa&#13;
26.       The prospect is much less austere for countries with a per capita&#13;
income ranging between $300-600 in 1977 prices. Several of these countries&#13;
have a sizeable mining sector (including oil) and the share of agriculture&#13;
in GDP and exports is lower than that in low-income countries. For this&#13;
and other reasons, the lower-middle income countries can expect some&#13;
improvement in their terms of trade during the 1980s (See Table 11). Their&#13;
average debt service ratio is much lower than that of the low-income group&#13;
and they can afford to borrow commercially to a larger extent. GDP is&#13;
expected to rise at about 4.8 percent per annum during the first half of&#13;
the 1980s.&#13;
27.       The 24 countries represented in Table 11 are a diverse lot.      Botswana,&#13;
for example, has her problems but its financial position is fairly comfortable&#13;
and rising prices for its exports will assure that there is no serious foreign&#13;
exchange constraint on the pace of economic growth. The situation is very&#13;
different in the Sudan, Mauritius and Zambia; all three face a severe foreign&#13;
exchange constraint.&#13;
28.       The Sudan has made considerable progress in defining a policy package&#13;
aimed at financial consolidation and structural change. It has put the following&#13;
measures into effect:&#13;
- To reverse the serious decline in the volume of exports during&#13;
the 1970s, the Government has thrice devalued the currency,&#13;
reduced export taxes, introduced a new cost recovery scheme&#13;
in the Gezira, abolished the nil value import scheme and&#13;
secured funds to purchase imports for the rehabilitation of&#13;
major irrigated cotton schemes.&#13;
- To avoid straining further the capacity of the economy to&#13;
design, finance and manage effectively new investments, the&#13;
Government has reduced the real volume of public capital&#13;
outlay below levels planned earlier and it has placed much&#13;
greater emphasis than before on projects aimed at removing&#13;
bottlenecks.&#13;
- To handle the very serious debt servicing problem, the&#13;
Government has taken stock of the profile of present and&#13;
future obligations and negotiated an agreement with the&#13;
Paris Club of official creditors. Government has also&#13;
undertaken to maintain accurate information on debt,&#13;
strengthen machinery for deciding on new obligations and&#13;
to continue efforts to reach an understanding with its&#13;
private creditors.&#13;

D. Implications for Donor and Creditor Policies&#13;
29.        In preparing for the 1980s, African Governments need to draw a&#13;
distinction between near-term and long-run strategies. Near-term, in this&#13;
context, is defined as the period over which:&#13;
- severe financial imbalances are eliminated, e.g., arrears&#13;
in foreign payments are wiped out and the current account&#13;
deficit as a proportion of GDP is reduced to a level which&#13;
can be financed by normal capital inflow;&#13;
-  the economy recovers, structural adjustments are made and&#13;
the normal pace of development is resumed.&#13;
30.       Near-term, in this context, may stretch over many years, perhaps&#13;
half a decade, perhaps more.    Once the economy has made the necessary&#13;
adjustments, the country can re-emphasize the pursuit of longer-run goals&#13;
such as poverty alleviation, stimulation of indigenous entrepreneurship,&#13;
research, improvement of the environment, etc. The distinction we are&#13;
suggesting is essentially a matter of emphasis. The need for progress in&#13;
relation to these longer-run goals is ever-present and whatever can be&#13;
done should be done to achieve these goals even during the near-term adjust-&#13;
ment phase. But priorities require consideration if the economy faces acute&#13;
financial pressures; the emphasis will then have to be placed on expanding&#13;
production, easing bottlenecks and obtaining the most out of scarce resources&#13;
31.       Should donors of African countries adopt a similar distinction&#13;
between near-term and long-term assistance strategies? For whatever reasons,&#13;
most donors have emphasized and even today continue to finance new projects.&#13;
Some donors attach special priority to projects which directly alleviate&#13;
poverty through primary education, health and family planning services,&#13;
small-farm development and promotion of small enterprises.&#13;
32.       What would a shift to a near-term assistance strategy imply?      In&#13;
the first place, it would imply a willingness to extend a much larger share&#13;
of assistance in quick disbursing non-project form, provided there is reason-&#13;
able assurance that such aid can be channelled into priority uses. The&#13;
rationale for non-project aid is linked, in the first place, to the current&#13;
situation. Capacity utilization, both in the public and private sectors, has&#13;
fallen to very low levels (paragraphs 11, 16) and a major cause is the&#13;
stringency of foreign exchange and budget funds. Under these circumstances,&#13;
the pay-off from non-project assistance can be substantially bigger in size&#13;
and quicker in time than that from new projects which take 5-7 years to&#13;
complete. Also, there are many countries in which the number of projects&#13;
under execution is rather large and these projects seem to be competing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
for scarce local resources, e.g., high-level managerial and administrative&#13;
know-how. External technical assistance has filled some of these gaps in&#13;
skills but the process of obtaining such assistance is far from smooth and&#13;
the tolerance of governments for expatriates is limited. A period of&#13;
consolidation of investment may be highly desirable in a number of cases;&#13;
it should help in speeding up the pace of implementation of on-going&#13;
investments and in reducing the aid pipeline.&#13;
33.       Among those who negotiate aid there is less than full understanding&#13;
of what a specific transaction means for the recipient economy. There is a&#13;
tendency to believe that projects financed by ODA are a free good entirely&#13;
and that it is always in the interest of the recipient government to accept&#13;
such bounty. This is not the full story, however. It is seldom that foreign&#13;
financing covers the whole of the capital cost of a project and frequently&#13;
there are explicit and hidden contributions required from the recipient&#13;
government's budget. Furthermore, the utilization of capacity created by&#13;
new projects requires recurrent outlays, imported inputs and management&#13;
attention. While these associated costs may be covered by external assist-&#13;
ance for a time, they will have to be supported by local resources once the&#13;
project period is over. For all these reasons, it would add greatly to the&#13;
flexibility of recipient governments if they knew that aid was fungible and&#13;
could be used either for starting new projects or for securing better utilza-&#13;
tion of present capacity. Such an understanding would reduce very much the&#13;
temptation on the part of aid recipients to start new projects in circumstances&#13;
when absorptive capacity is already strained.&#13;
34.       Secondly, a near-term assistance strategy would imply a much larger&#13;
emphasis on projects which yield quick benefits to the recipient economy as&#13;
opposed to those which involve major departures such as the establishment of&#13;
new institutions or the testing of new technical packages. The latter can&#13;
only be expected to fructify over an extended time period. There is a sense&#13;
in which projects incorporating major departures are more important for the&#13;
development process than those which yield benefits quickly by replicating&#13;
successful experiences well within the technological and institutional frontiers&#13;
of society. If the economic and financial situation is urgent, however, quick&#13;
yielding investments can play a tactical role in triggering off recovery and&#13;
adjustment and thereby facilitate a resumption of the development momentum.&#13;
35.        For example, the Sudan Government regretfully concluded that it&#13;
would be wise, in the present context, to concentrate agricultural investments&#13;
on irrigated schemes along the Nile and adopt a much more circumspect position&#13;
regarding the initiation of new projects for rural development in other parts&#13;
of the country involving traditional communities and agro-ecological zones for&#13;
which technical packages had not yet been fully tested. Such a re-orientation&#13;
may be regarded by some as a devaluation of the equity objective since the&#13;
population in the irrigated areas tends on balance to be relatively prosperous,&#13;
compared to that in the rest of the country. This interpretation, however, is&#13;
a superficial one. The equity goal has to be pursued through a variety of&#13;
instruments of which the design of projects is only one. In the circumstances&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
of the Sudan today it makes good sense to pursue equity through fiscal&#13;
instruments, i.e., by full cost recovery from and progressive taxation of&#13;
the direct beneficiaries of irrigation investments. Such an approach&#13;
would reduce deficits of parastatal bodies, raise tax revenues and allow&#13;
the Government to prepare for the stage when it can take measures to assist&#13;
poverty groups directly.&#13;
36.       Thirdly, a near-term strategy implies much closer collaboration&#13;
than has existed up to now between providers of ODA and other agencies of&#13;
DAC and OPEC member governments who have responsibility for managing export&#13;
or suppliers' credit. Several African countries borrowed excessively and&#13;
indiscriminately on commercial terms during the 1970s and the servicing of&#13;
this debt imposes a heavy burden on their balance of payments today and&#13;
will continue to do so for sometime. The treatment of contractual obligations&#13;
(i.e., the extent to which creditors insist that these claims be paid when&#13;
due as against agreement to postpone or refinance) has become a central issue&#13;
in the relationship of these countries to their overseas partners. The present&#13;
practice of separating aid and debt decisions in these cases may prove to be&#13;
counter-productive; it can jeopardize a promising attempt on the part of a&#13;
debtor government to put through a viable policy-reform package. It is in&#13;
the interest of creditors, as also of aid-givers, that economic and financial&#13;
health is restored to economies of borrower countries. This requires a new&#13;
approach and a new orientation on the part of aid-givers and creditors.&#13;
37.       To recapitulate, many African countries and particularly low-income&#13;
ones face extremely difficult conditions and no relief is in sight. In these&#13;
circumstances, foreign partners (donors and creditors) will wish to support&#13;
African governments who show courage in facing up to their problems by:&#13;
- expanding concessional assistance beyond what is assumed&#13;
in paragraph 20;&#13;
- providing a larger part of assistance in quick disbursing&#13;
form and making clear to recipient governments that aid is&#13;
fungible as between financing new projects or inputs for&#13;
completed investments;&#13;
- emphasizing the starting of quick yielding projects and&#13;
postponing those which will take a long time to complete; and&#13;
- postponing the burden of heavy debt service so that borrower&#13;
economies are not starved of foreign exchange while they are&#13;
carrying out a program of policy reform.&#13;

            Eastern and Southern Africa : past trends
            and future prospects
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A brief overview of the past economic
            developments and future prospects in Eastern and Southern
            Africa are presented. Africa has experienced lagging income
            growth, and its population growth has accelerated while
            other less developed areas have slowed their population
            growth. Additional problems are posed by the increasing
            deficit in the balance of payments of many African
            countries. Economic prospects of low income African
            countries depend on how the international economic situation
            evolves and the manner in which governments of these
            countries respond to the circumstances facing them.
            Altogether, the prospects are for a substantial
            deterioration in the terms of trade of low income African
            countries. Future prospects for lower middle income Africa
            are much less austere. Several of these countries have a
            sizeable mining sector, and the share of agriculture in GDP
            and exports is lower than that in low middle income
            countries. For this and other reasons, the lower middle
            income African countries can expect some improvement in
            their terms of trade during the 1980s. It is concluded that
            many African countries, and particularly low income ones,
            face extremely difficult conditions and no relief is in sight.
