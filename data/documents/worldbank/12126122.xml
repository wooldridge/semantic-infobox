The Little Green Data Book 2006 is based on World Development Indicators&#13;
2006 and its accompanying CD-ROM. Defining, gathering, and disseminating&#13;
international statistics is a collective effort of many people and organizations.&#13;
The indicators in World Development Indicators are the fruit of decades of&#13;
work at many levels, from the field workers who administer censuses and&#13;
household surveys to the committees and working parties of the national&#13;
and international statistical agencies that develop the nomenclature, classi-&#13;
fications, and standards fundamental to the international statistical system.&#13;
Nongovernmental organizations have also made important contributions. We&#13;
are indebted to the network of World Development Indicators' partners, as&#13;
detailed in World Development Indicators 2006. The financial assistance of&#13;
the Government of Sweden is also gratefully acknowledged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Little Green Data Book is the result of close collaboration between the&#13;
staff of the Environment Department and the Development Economics Data&#13;
Group. Mehdi Akhlaghi, Richard Fix, Kirk Hamilton, Beat Hintermann, Gonca&#13;
Okur, M. H. Saeed Ordoubadi, Suzette Pedroso-Galinato, Giovanni Ruta, and&#13;
Alexandra Sears contributed to its preparation. Communications Development&#13;
Incorporated provided design, editing, and layout, led by Meta de Coquereaumont&#13;
with the assistance of Christopher Trott. The production team also included&#13;
Jodi Baxter, Brendon Boyle, and Michael Diavolikis. Staff from External Affairs&#13;
oversaw publication and dissemination of the book.&#13;

The 2006 edition of The Little Green Data Book coincides with a wave of&#13;
renewed attention to the energy sector coming out of the Group of Eight Summit&#13;
at Gleneagles, Scotland. While energy demand is rising along with GDP in the&#13;
developing world, many poor countries still lack the basic infrastructure that&#13;
sustains everyday needs. Electric power consumption per capita is 25 times&#13;
lower in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The poorest&#13;
people in the world depend heavily on natural resources to meet their energy&#13;
needs. In Sub-Saharan Africa nearly 60 percent of the energy used comes&#13;
from combustible renewables and waste.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Development and poverty alleviation--the World Bank's mission--call for a&#13;
long-term vision. Besides meeting increasing energy needs through clean&#13;
means, important steps toward poverty reduction include enhancing environ-&#13;
mental quality, improving natural resources management, and maintaining&#13;
global ecosystems. Better environmental management can improve people's&#13;
livelihoods, health, and security today and in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To achieve these lasting results, we need to start from a sound base of informa-&#13;
tion that helps us set priorities and measure progress toward environmental&#13;
sustainability goals. The Little Green Data Book is a step in this direction,&#13;
with key indicators of the environment and its relationship to people for more&#13;
than 200 countries. This year's edition includes recently updated data on&#13;
carbon dioxide emissions and on particulate matter concentrations in urban&#13;
areas, as well as the new GEF benefits index for biodiversity. While there are&#13;
gaps and shortcomings in the data, we hope that this book will inspire deci-&#13;
sionmakers at all levels to use this information and to seek to fill the gaps&#13;
for their own countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Little Green Data Book represents a succinct collection of information&#13;
from World Development Indicators 2006 and its accompanying CD-ROM. It&#13;
is a collaboration between the Development Data Group and the Environment&#13;
Department of the World Bank. We welcome your suggestions for how to&#13;
improve future editions and make them more useful.&#13;

&amp;#12;Data notes&#13;
The data in this book are for the most recent year available; for details, see the&#13;
&#13;
glossary. Regional aggregates include data for low- and middle-income econo-&#13;
&#13;
mies only. Aggregates for regions and income groups are shown only if data are&#13;
&#13;
available for 66 percent of the economies in that group.&#13;
&#13;
Symbols used:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          ..    indicates that data are not available or that aggregates cannot&#13;
&#13;
                be calculated because of missing data.&#13;
&#13;
    0 or 0.0    indicates zero or less than half the unit shown.&#13;
&#13;
          $     indicates current U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or for&#13;
&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. The word country&#13;
&#13;
(used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political independence or&#13;
&#13;
official recognition by the World Bank but refers to any economy for which the&#13;
&#13;
authorities report separate social or economic statistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In keeping with World Development Indicators 2006, this edition of The Little&#13;
&#13;
Green Data Book uses terminology in line with the 1993 System of National&#13;
&#13;
Accounts. In particular, gross national product (GNP) is replaced by gross national&#13;
&#13;
income (GNI).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The selection of indicators in these pages includes some that are being used&#13;
&#13;
to monitor progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. For more infor-&#13;

For operational and analytical purposes the World Bank's main criterion for&#13;
&#13;
classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Every economy&#13;
&#13;
is classified as low income, middle income (subdivided into lower middle and&#13;
&#13;
upper middle), or high income. Low-and middle-income economies are some-&#13;
&#13;
times referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is convenient;&#13;
&#13;
it is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are experiencing&#13;
&#13;
similar development or that other economies have reached a preferred or final&#13;
&#13;
stage of development. Classification by income does not necessarily reflect&#13;
&#13;
development status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $825 or less in&#13;
&#13;
2004.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than $825&#13;
&#13;
but less than $10,066. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income econo-&#13;
&#13;
mies are separated at a GNI per capita of $3,255.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $10,066 or&#13;
&#13;
more.&#13;

&amp;#12;Glossary&#13;
Access to an improved water source is the percentage of the population with&#13;
   reasonable access to an adequate amount of water from an improved&#13;
   source, such as a household connection, public standpipe, borehole, pro-&#13;
   tected well or spring, or rainwater collection. Unimproved sources include&#13;
   vendors, tanker trucks, and unprotected wells and springs. Reasonable&#13;
   access to an adequate amount is defined as the availability of at least&#13;
   20 liters a person a day from a source within 1 kilometer of the dwelling.&#13;
   (World Health Organization; data are for 2002)&#13;
&#13;
Access to improved sanitation is the percentage of population with access&#13;
   to at least adequate excreta disposal facilities (private or shared, but not&#13;
   public) that can effectively prevent human, animal, and insect contact with&#13;
   excreta. Improved facilities range from simple but protected pit latrines to&#13;
   flush toilets with a sewerage connection. To be effective, facilities must be&#13;
   correctly constructed and properly maintained. (World Health Organization;&#13;
   data are for 2002)&#13;
&#13;
Acute respiratory infection (ARI) prevalence refers to the percentage of chil-&#13;
   dren under age 5 with acute respiratory infection in the two weeks prior to&#13;
   the survey. (United Nations Children's Fund; data are for 1998­2004)&#13;
&#13;
Adjusted net savings equal net savings plus education expenditures minus&#13;
    energy depletion, mineral depletion, net forest depletion, and particulate&#13;
    matter and carbon dioxide damage. (World Bank; data are for 2004)&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural land refers to arable land, land under permanent crops, and&#13;
    permanent pastures. Arable land includes land defined by the Food and&#13;
    Agriculture Organization as land under temporary crops (double-cropped&#13;
    areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture,&#13;
    land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land&#13;
    abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded. Land under per-&#13;
    manent crops is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long&#13;
    periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa,&#13;
    coffee, and rubber. This category includes land under flowering shrubs,&#13;
    fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land under trees grown for&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The 2006 edition of the little green
            data book coincides with a wave of renewed attention to the
            energy sector coming out of the group of eight summit at
            Gleneagles, Scotland. While energy demand is rising along
            with gross domestic product (GDP) in the developing world,
            many poor countries still lack the basic infrastructure that
            sustains everyday needs. Electric power consumption per
            capita is 25 times lower in low-income countries than in
            high-income countries. The poorest people in the world
            depend heavily on natural resources to meet their energy
            needs. In Sub-Saharan Africa nearly 60 percent of the energy
            used comes from combustible renewables and waste. The little
            green data book is a step in this direction, with key
            indicators of the environment and its relationship to people
            for more than 200 countries. This year's edition
            includes recently updated data on carbon dioxide emissions
            and on particulate matter concentrations in urban areas, as
            well as the new global environment facility (GEF) benefits
            index for biodiversity.
