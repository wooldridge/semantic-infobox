CHAPTER I&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1          Lithuania is the largest of the Baltic republics, with a territory of 65,200 sq km and a&#13;
population of nearly 3.7 million people. During the Soviet era, Lithuania enjoyed a higher standard of&#13;
living than many other republics of the Former Soviet Union (FSU). While Lithuania does not have&#13;
abundant natural resources, it has inherited a highly skilled work force and a relatively well-developed&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
1.2          Agriculture is the second largest sector in the Lithuanian economy and has been one of&#13;
the country's main sources of income, employment, and foreign exchange earnings'. By the end of 1994,&#13;
agriculture accounted for nearly 23 % of the GDP, employed about 25 % of the labor force, and produced&#13;
24% of all exports. Traditionally the sector produced a surplus, mostly in livestock products which&#13;
accounted for 67% of total agricultural output. Crop production, the bulk of which has been grain for&#13;
the livestock industry, has averaged 30% of total agricultural output for most of the past decade.&#13;
1.3          By 1994 agricultural production declined by more than 35% when compared to 1987-89&#13;
average levels, while exports had declined even more, by roughly 50%. The livestock industry was&#13;
particularly hard hit. Crop production had also declined; over 20% of arable land was left idle because&#13;
of lack of inputs and working capital, uncertainty over property rights, and inadequate marketing support&#13;
services. It is generally believed that the required reduction in agricultural production has been achieved&#13;
as witnessed by the stabilized agricultural production levels of 1995.&#13;
1.4          Despite these recent problems, Lithuanian agriculture has the potential to become a&#13;
reliable source of income and employment for the rural population. This will require structural&#13;
adjustments in the sector induced through continuous policy reforms and rational investment strategies.&#13;
Future production levels and patterns will have to be determined by market conditions and based on&#13;
comparative advantages. Already, Lithuania has been quite successful in redirecting its agricultural&#13;
exports to non-former Soviet Union (FSU) markets. There are also signs that investments are being made&#13;
in the sector as farmers, with improving agricultural terms of trade, start to regain confidence.&#13;
1.5          The proposed Private Agriculture Development Project (PADP) would be the first Bank&#13;
Group supported investment project for the agricultural sector in Lithuania. The PADP has been&#13;
designed to promote the sector's transformation to a market-based system by removing some of the main&#13;
constraints.  In addition to investment credit, the project would provide technical assistance for&#13;
strengthening rural financial intermediaries, and institutional and human skills conducive to the&#13;
development of a private agricultural sector. Chapter I gives the general background information that&#13;
is pertinent to the project, Chapter II evaluates the rural banking sector and the present constraints,&#13;
Chapter III describes the project in detail, Chapter IV outlines implementation and management&#13;
arrangements for the project, Chapter V analyzes benefits and risks of the project, and finally, Chapter&#13;
VI summarizes agreements reached during negotiations and conditions for loan effectiveness.&#13;

13111-LT), issued on April 14, 1995, by the World Bank, Washington, DC.&#13;

B. AGRICULTURAL PERFORMANCE AND POLICY REFORMS&#13;
1.6          Macro stabilization. Since regaining independence in 1991, Lithuania has embarked on&#13;
a reform program aimed at reorienting its economy away from a centrally planned system toward a&#13;
market-based one. In that context, the Government of Lithuania (GOL) has made substantial progress&#13;
in economic stabilization and structural reforms. Inflation declined from over 1,000% in 1992 to 410%&#13;
in 1993. In 1994 the macro situation stabilized to the extent that inflation was down to 45%. The&#13;
estimated inflation for 1995 is even lower, at around 30%. Since 1993 the country has had a fully&#13;
convertible and stable currency, the Litas (LTL), which is pegged to the US dollar. Prices have been&#13;
liberalized, a new trade regime is being developed, and the country has made progress in reorienting its&#13;
trade. The share of non-FSU exports to total exports increased from 28% in 1992 to over 50% in 1994.&#13;
Moreover, there has been significant progress in the privatization of banking institutions, small&#13;
businesses, and agricultural land.&#13;
1.7          Agricultural Reforms to Date. The GOL is also committed to the transformation of the&#13;
agricultural sector to compete in a market economy - a transition that includes agricultural policy reform,&#13;
land reform, and privatization. The GOL's initial response during the post-Soviet era was to protect&#13;
farmers; however such protectionist policies are now being progressively removed. To date the GOL has&#13;
made considerable progress in a number of areas: (a) land restitution is at an advanced stage; (b)&#13;
privatization of small-scale processing enterprises has been significant; (c) the GOL does not sets&#13;
procurement quotas (except for a strategic food reserve) or controls consumer prices; (d) retail margin&#13;
controls on foodstuffs were removed in early 1995; (e) import tariffs on foodstuffs, with few exceptions,&#13;
were reduced to more moderate levels under the agreed Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program with the&#13;
IMF; (f) bankruptcy laws have been enacted; and (g) competition laws and fair practice supervisory roles&#13;
have been strengthened.&#13;
1.8          Reversal of Policy Reforms. In recent months, the Government of Lithuania has been&#13;
subject to tremendous political pressure to take into greater account the social impact of the transition in&#13;
the agricultural sector as well as the protectionism of the Western developed economies vis-a-vis imported&#13;
agricultural goods. Due to increasing economic and social hardship, particularly for farmers and others&#13;
in the rural sector, the Government has re-introduced minimum price supports for selected commodities&#13;
and has slowed the elimination of subsidized credit. These recent moves are clearly a reversal of the&#13;
previous liberal policy reforms achieved by the Government. Nevertheless, the new supports are limited&#13;
in scope, and while they would delay the liberalization of the sector, they would not be able to reverse&#13;
the structural reforms already being taking place in the sector. The minimum marginal price support&#13;
scheme covers only a small number of products (milk, beef, pork, rapeseed, buckwheat and flax), and&#13;
the LTL 137 million allocated for this in the 1995 budget was equivalent to less than 4% of the total Gross&#13;
Value of Agricultural Output in that year. Furthermore, the recent trend in the market has led to market&#13;
prices often exceeding the set minimum prices for most of the products, hence rendering the price support&#13;
scheme ineffective and harmless. Additionally, contrary to the Government's announcement of gradual&#13;
reduction, the budgetary allocation for subsidized credit has declined by more than 50% from LTL 110&#13;
million in 1994 to LTL 50 million in 1995.&#13;
1.9          Furthermore, in discussions with the Bank during the initial sector work and subsequent&#13;
project preparation, the Government has re-iterated its commitment to policy reforms that would promote&#13;
the growth of a market oriented and competitive agricultural sector. As an initial step toward meeting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background                                                                                3&#13;
that goal, the Government has started more direct support to farmers (e.g. providing incentives to&#13;
improve the quality of their beef and milk through the provision of high quality breeding stocks, etc.).&#13;
The Government has also stated in the Development Policy Letter (see Attachment 1 of this report) that&#13;
it plans to phase out minimum price support and subsidized credit over a four year period ending in 1999.&#13;
In addition, during project implementation, the Government has agreed to reduce the total agricultural&#13;
subsidies each year by no less than 4% in real terms from the previous fiscal year's level. With the&#13;
policy reforms achieved so far, and the continuous commitment by the Government, the distortions of&#13;
the incentive systems in the sector are limited enough to justify Bank support.&#13;
C. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.10         Government's Objectives. The Government has declared that agriculture is a national&#13;
priority because of the position it holds in social, cultural, and environmental affairs. Current opinion&#13;
in the country suggests that Lithuania should support the most important agricultural products and&#13;
exports; that natural resources and land should be protected and improved; that organic agriculture should&#13;
be introduced; and that an optimal size structure of farms should be established based on market signals.&#13;
1.11         Surveys of farmers and Agricultural Companies (ACs), and the rural population2 have&#13;
indicated that, in addition to declines in revenues from agricultural production, there are limited income&#13;
earning opportunities for laid-off farmers and agricultural workers. The Government is keen to obtain&#13;
technical assistance in the areas of retraining redundant workers and the re-engineering of existing&#13;
production facilities. In particular, the Government is interested in: (a) stimulating the establishmnent of&#13;
new rural businesses and group initiatives which create jobs; (b) stimulating the development of new rural&#13;
income generating activities for families on small farms; (c) ensuring that the female population of rural&#13;
areas benefits fromr the restructuring and development of the rural economies; (d) developing Lithuanian&#13;
skills for long-term implementation of these goals; and (e) having support for the sector focus on&#13;
development of the entire food delivery chain - from primary production, to processing, and to marketing&#13;
and distribution.&#13;
1.12         New Roles of Government. The main development challenge facing Lithuania is the need&#13;
to maintain a stable economy while accelerating and deepening the structural reform process to elicit a&#13;
strong supply response in the private sector. Accordingly, the Government has recognized that during the&#13;
transition, its role should change from the direct provision of goods and services towards indirect&#13;
government guidance of the economy through legal, regulatory, and policy measures. Although&#13;
imperfect, the legal and regulatory capacity is reasonable to foster private activities, and the Government&#13;
continues to improve its supervisory capacity through various technical assistance and training program&#13;
for civil servants. These changes would allow greater incentives and the opportunity to take advantage&#13;
of the efficiency of the private sector, while reducing total government expenditure and easing overall&#13;
fiscal pressures. Consistent with the general trend, Government expenditures on agriculture have fallen&#13;
each year since 1991, primarily through a reduction in subsidies, and this trend is expected to continue.&#13;
2  The Survey was carried out by the Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics in Autumn 1994 for the Social Program for&#13;
Rural Development.&#13;

4                                                                                  Chapter I&#13;
D. COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES AND PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE&#13;
1.13         Comparative Advantages of the Agriculture Sector. The agriculture sector has good&#13;
economic potential primarily because of its relatively favorable agro-climatic conditions, well established&#13;
agricultural traditions, and a trained pool of farmers and technicians. The conditions are particularly well&#13;
suited for production of grains, root crops, and livestock, and they are also suitable for the production&#13;
of some fruits and vegetables. While the country traditionally has been a net exporter of livestock&#13;
commodities to the rest of the FSU, crop and livestock yield potentials have not been realized, and there&#13;
is much room for productivity gains. The food processing industry, once equipped with modem&#13;
technology and more diversified product lines, can compete in international markets. With additional&#13;
investment, the current high level of losses throughout the food production system from limited storage,&#13;
handling, and transportation facilities can be significantly reduced. There is substantial potential to&#13;
increase raw product yields and processing and distribution efficiency, which could increase the&#13;
competitiveness of Lithuanian agriculture.&#13;
1.14         Efforts are now under way to improve economic conditions in rural areas by identifying&#13;
and supporting alternative income and employment generating activities. Taking advantage of the&#13;
relatively clean air and water in certain rural areas, small scale business opportunities such as eco-&#13;
tourism, hunting, etc. are being explored. Handicrafts, especially textiles, woodworking, and log home&#13;
building are being promoted as low-tech, natural resource based rural income earners.  Regional&#13;
governments are eager to receive technical assistance in identifying alternative employment possibilities&#13;
and training in the skills necessary to pursue these opportunities. A pilot program, the Rural Employment&#13;
Generation component devised under the proposed project, would support the selected districts by&#13;
identifying alternative employment possibilities and providing training for new careers and business&#13;
opportunities. The pilot program would be expanded to wider areas and be sustainable long after project&#13;
funding has ceased (see paras. 3.2 and 3.23).&#13;
1.15         Challenges Ahead. Challenges remain during the transition period to restructure and&#13;
revitalize the agriculture sector while removing the remaining constraints. The main challenges to address&#13;
are: (a) the emergence of large numbers of newly created private farmers without productive assets and&#13;
capital, the full range of inputs, or modern farming skills; (b) difficulty in creating and enforcing legal&#13;
collateral; (c) the almost complete absence of medium- or long-term rural credit to the sector; (d) rural&#13;
employment problems caused by the down-sizing of processing industries; (e) inefficient and under-&#13;
utilized agro-industries with outdated technology and equipment; (e) slow privatization of large-scale agro-&#13;
processing and service industries; and (f) the insufficient support services, including extension, research,&#13;
marketing, and distribution.&#13;
1.16         To meet these challenges, the process of policy reform must continue to provide a&#13;
nurturing environment for much-needed investment to revitalize the sector. This will facilitate the&#13;
restructuring and rehabilitating of the sector based on market signals. Future lending for agriculture&#13;
should be based on commercial and financial viability. Additionally, the reform program in agriculture&#13;
should be consistent, and properly sequenced, with the macroeconomic reform framework and programs.&#13;
A proposed Structural Adjustment Loan for Lithuania includes, among other things, a comprehensive&#13;
agricultural policy reform package which would be coordinated and synchronized with other related&#13;
intersectoral and macro-economic policy reform. In the interim, the proposed project would address&#13;
some of these key constraints through its financial and technical assistance.&#13;

CHAPTER II&#13;
THE RURAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM&#13;
A. THE BANKING SYSTEM&#13;
2.1          As is the case with most transitional economies, the financial sector in Lithuania is still&#13;
weak. Since independence, three state-owned banks, 25 commercial banks, a development bank, and one&#13;
representative office of a foreign bank have been established. The three state-owned banks, the&#13;
Agricultural Bank, the State Savings Bank, and the State Commercial Bank, account for nearly 50% of&#13;
total asset market share, however International Accounting Standards (IAS) audits of all three State Banks&#13;
concluded that they all have inadequate capital structures and lack institutional capacity. Of the 25 private&#13;
commercial banks created since independence, only about 15 were still functioning by mid-1995. While&#13;
a significant informal financial sector had also developed post-independence, based mostly on local&#13;
trading companies in search of profitable outlets for excess liquidity; their importance has recently&#13;
declined sharply.&#13;
2.2           The Private Commercial Banks. Although about 15 commercial banks are still operating,&#13;
this number is likely to be reduced in the coming years through consolidation, mergers, and liquidation.&#13;
Most of the commercial banks had started out as the treasury arm of their state-owned enterprise&#13;
founders. However, progress in enterprise privatization, and successful attempts at raising new capital&#13;
have weakened those ties considerably. Some of the more active banks have already succeeded in&#13;
acquiring credit lines from foreign sources. A few of the banks have participated in two EU-PHARE&#13;
funded credit lines, each of which amounts to ECU 3 million and finances investments by small and&#13;
medium-sized enterprises. Three of the more active banks have already been judged eligible to participate&#13;
in the Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Project (EFSAP), recently approved by the Bank.'&#13;
2.3          During the last three years the larger private banks have been expanding their network&#13;
of branches and many now have branch offices in the major towns of the country. Funding comes mainly&#13;
from new private sector enterprises, and a large portion is denominated in foreign currency. While&#13;
initially most of these banks limited their activities to short-term foreign currency loans and accounts in&#13;
foreign correspondent banks, more recently banks have been expanding their lending activities to lending&#13;
in domestic and foreign currency, mostly for short-term trading. International audits and portfolio&#13;
reviews, coupled with the introduction by BOL of a loan classification and provisioning rule which&#13;
became effective on April 1, 1994, indicate that most of the banks will have to raise additional capital&#13;
and build up their loan loss provisions. Banks have started to respond to this challenge by cutting their&#13;
dividend pay-outs and by increasing their efforts to increase their equity.&#13;
B. FINANCING OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
Limited Credit to the Agricultural Sector&#13;
2.4          Due to lack of information, experience, and expertise in lending to agricultural activities,&#13;
Lithuanian commercial banks are not extending credit to farmers and small-scale rural enterprises. High&#13;
transaction costs of servicing small size farm loans, uncertainties surrounding collateral, titles, and a&#13;
I     Lithuania Enterprise and Financial Assistance Project, (Ln #8536 ) approved by the Board on April 13. 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                               Chapter 2&#13;
general perception that farm lending has relatively high risk, all serve to aggravate the situation. Banks&#13;
are predominantly engaged in the financing of highly profitable short-term trading activities and there is&#13;
very little long-term credit in the banking system as a whole, much less for lending to the agriculture&#13;
sector. The current banking system has failed to respond to the phasing out of subsidized credit by the&#13;
Government and the opportunities being opened up by newly emerging private farmers and private rural&#13;
entrepreneurs. Yet, with more than 25% of the country's income being generated from agriculture, the&#13;
sector presents a good choice for banks to diversify their lending and other banking activities. A program&#13;
of targeted support which provides initial long-term credit to agriculture, accompanied by carefully&#13;
designed technical assistance to beneficiaries, would act as a catalyst to overcome the above obstacles,&#13;
and thus "open" the market potential of lending to previously excluded groups such as small-scale rural&#13;
entrepreneurs and private farmers. Such directed support would demonstrate that agricultural lending can&#13;
be profitable for banks if they are willing to acquire the necessary skills, and operate in the rural areas&#13;
with an established client base. The project is designed to fill the gap by providing a catalytic force to&#13;
develop a sound rural financing system.&#13;
2.5          Limited Support to Private Farmers. Official statistics show that the number of registered&#13;
individual farm holdings exceeded 134,000 by the end of 1995, of which at least 30,000 are operating&#13;
private farms and the remainder are leasing out their landholding to other farmers or ACs. Because of&#13;
uneven and arbitrary granting of credits, the number of private farmers and ACs benefiting from the&#13;
special short-term credits provided by the Government has been small. Furthermore, most of these&#13;
private farmers and ACs have not had access to long-term conunercial credit.&#13;
2.6          With a near absence of long-term investment credit and pent-up demand on the part of&#13;
newly established private farmers, demand for credit, particularly for long-term investment credit, is&#13;
likely to be substantial. Agriculture traditionally has been an important contributor to the national&#13;
economy and with a continuously increasing number of registered private farms, there would be an&#13;
adequate client basis for the proposed US $30 million credit line. With estimated average loan sizes of&#13;
LTL 20,000 for working capital and around LTL 200,000 to LTL 400,000 for long-term investment, the&#13;
maximum number of clients to be served under the proposed project would be around 2,000 to 2,500.&#13;
The Farm Survey (see para 3.31 and Annex 3) has also confirmed that the emerging private farmers&#13;
have almost no access to investment credit to purchase appropriate equipment and fixed assets and to&#13;
finance the start-up and development of their farming enterprise.&#13;
2.7          Subsidized Credit. By the end of 1994, total institutional credit to agriculture, almost&#13;
entirely in the form of short-term credit, was about LTL 500 million. Of this, about 25 % was channeled&#13;
from Government sources through the ABL at highly concessionary terms (at annual interest rates of 5 %&#13;
and 8%). The source of this subsidized credit was the Agriculture Support Fund (ASF) which was&#13;
created in February 1994 by the Government. A part of the ASF was also allocated to various subsidy&#13;
programs for producers and processors, including subsidies for bread bakeries. By August 1, 1995, the&#13;
total outstanding balance of loans financed from the ASF amounted to about LTL 122 million. Due to&#13;
its relatively small size which is declining even more, the actual impact of subsidized credit has been&#13;
relatively small and limited.&#13;
2.8          Furthermore, the Government has recognized that subsidized credit cannot be sustained&#13;
and is too costly to the econorny. Accordingly, the GOL has: (a) proposed and obtained the necessary&#13;
Parliamentary approval for diverting LTL 70 million from the ASF for recapitalization of the ABL; (b)&#13;
reduced the budgetary allocation for subsidized credit from LTL 110 million in 1994 to LTL 50 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7he Rural Financial System                                                            7&#13;
in 1995; and (c) is committed to gradually phasing out the entire subsidized credit program by the end&#13;
of 1999. As a project conditionality, an agreement with the Government was reached during negotiations&#13;
on the gradual reduction of overall agricultural subsidies. This agreement provides that during Project&#13;
implementation, the total amount of subsidies, including credit subsidies, to the agricultural sector&#13;
would be reduced annually by no less than 4% in real terms from the previous fiscal year's level.&#13;
The Agricultural Bank of Lithuania&#13;
2.9          The Agricultural Bank of Lithuania (ABL) has been the sole source of agricultural credit&#13;
in Lithuania. ABL specializes in providing banking services to the agricultural sector although it is a&#13;
universal bank authorized to serve all other sectors of the economy. In October, 1993, the bank formally&#13;
became a joint stock company with a capital of LTL 20 million and 49% private ownership (with about&#13;
10% of the share capital held by a large number of ABL employees). The ABL has a network of 46&#13;
branches throughout the country, with a total staff of approximately 2,300 that serves about 215,000&#13;
clients. At the end of 1993, a portfolio review and audit in accordance with IAS revealed that, taking&#13;
into account required provisions for its non-performing loans, the bank was insolvent as of December 31,&#13;
1993. The audit also pointed to deficiencies and weaknesses in the bank's credit policies, procedures,&#13;
accounting, and internal control systems.&#13;
2.10         Positive Developments within ABL. Since its first IAS audit of 1993, the situation of the&#13;
ABL has improved substantially. First, the senior management of ABL was changed during 1994. The&#13;
new management is receptive to outside support and welcomes the restructuring and commercialization&#13;
of the ABL with the ultimate goal of privatization. The IAS Audit for 1994 showed that ABL's capital&#13;
position had improved considerably, and it had a net income of over LTL 68 million after taxes. The&#13;
ABL had extended LTL 827 million (US $207 million) in loans, of which about 60% was for the&#13;
agricultural sector, and approximately one third of this (LTL 158 million, or US $40 million equivalent)&#13;
was to farmers. Its liabilities consisted of deposits, partly from its client borrowers - ACs, agro-&#13;
processing enterprises, and private farmers.  Bank of Lithuania (BOL) refinancing and special&#13;
Government funding formed an important source of the ABL's loanable funds. Annex 4 provides&#13;
additional information on the Agricultural Bank together with its audited financial statements for 1994.&#13;
2.11         The Government Commitment to ABL Restructuring. Further positive developments have&#13;
occurred in ABL during 1995. The Government recognized that the ABL, with its extensive branch&#13;
network and staff, was likely to be the main channel for rural credit and initiated measures to strengthen&#13;
the ABL both financially and operationally: (a) the GOL has declared its commitment to discontinue the&#13;
channeling of political loans through the ABL, thus separating the previous fiscal agency role from the&#13;
ABL's commercial lending activities. In the interim, when acting as a fiscal agent for GOL, the ABL&#13;
shall not bear the lending risk; (b) the GOL has agreed to take over bad loans which were the result of&#13;
politically directed lending from the ABL's portfolio and to assist the ABL in its financial restructuring&#13;
effort; and (c) the GOL has committed to inject new share capital which would allow ABL to fully restore&#13;
its capital base and move towards becoming a viable commercial bank. The Government's proposal to&#13;
recapitalize the ABL by diverting funds from the main source of subsidies, the Agricultural Support Fund,&#13;
has been approved by Parliament. This would increase the ABL capital without additional budgetary&#13;
pressures and at the same time reduce direct subsidies for agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                              Chapter 2&#13;
2.12         In addition to recapitalization and restructuring, the Government has stated that although&#13;
it will be the majority shareholder of the ABL immediately following recapitalization, it will be a&#13;
temporary step in the process towards full privatization of the ABL. In the interim, the Government&#13;
would ensure full autonomy for the ABL in loan approval. The Government, in collaboration with the&#13;
Council and Board of the ABL, will prepare a detailed privatization plan with a definite time-schedule&#13;
during the first phase of the ABL twinning project. It is expected that by December 1997, such a detailed&#13;
privatization plan would be in place.&#13;
2.13         Institutional Development Support for ABL. In order for the ABL to function as a&#13;
commercial bank, it will require substantial institutional strengthening to improve both its management&#13;
and operations. The proposed project would provide an opportunity to discontinue the past non-&#13;
commercial practices of the ABL and transform it into a true commercial bank through comprehensive&#13;
institutional development support along with a commercial credit line. An overall Institutional&#13;
Development Program (IDP) through a two year twinning arrangement with an experienced foreign bank&#13;
is being prepared. TA activities, supported by a team of long-term consultants and financed by EU-&#13;
PHARE, for strengthening and improving credit management in ABL and other PFIs, have already been&#13;
in place since fall 1995, and the new operational guidelines relating to credit operations would become&#13;
effective before starting disbursements of the proposed Loan. The management of ABL is fully&#13;
committed to implementing a wide-ranging institutional development program, with the assistance of&#13;
foreign experts. TA modules with quarterly schedules, Terms of Reference (TOR), and indicators to&#13;
monitor progress of the Institutional Development Program were prepared by the Bank and agreed with&#13;
ABL and the Government (see para. 3.15 and Annex 5 for full details).&#13;
C. STRENGTHENING RURAL FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION&#13;
2.14         In order to identify potential financial intermediaries to address rural credit needs,&#13;
particularly the needs of small-scale farmers and rural entrepreneurs and to determine which financial&#13;
institutions would be most able to absorb the necessary TA for eventual financial intermediation under&#13;
the proposed PADP, a survey of banks was carried out. The survey canvassed 11 banks, eight leading&#13;
commercial banks and three State banks. The results showed:&#13;
(a) All the private commercial banks expressed interest in participating in projects lending to agro-&#13;
processing and agro-services enterprises; however commercial banks had reservations in regard&#13;
to lending to the farming community, private individual farmers, and ACs. Only one commercial&#13;
bank showed an interest in lending directly to farmers, and then only if they were linked to&#13;
processing enterprises.&#13;
(b) All three state banks, and the ABL in particular, expressed interest in lending to farmers,&#13;
processors, and service enterprises. The results of the 1993 audit of the three state banks showed&#13;
that they would require financial restructuring and major institutional improvements and&#13;
strengthening before they could qualify to participate in Bank operations.&#13;
2.15         The PADP would mitigate the perceived risks in agricultural lending by providing&#13;
necessary technical and financial assistance to a small number of major commercial banks willing to serve&#13;
the agricultural sector. TA to improve the collateral basis through intensification of land titling, training&#13;
of loan officers specifically in lending to agriculture, and strengthening institutional capabilities of banks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Rural Financial System                                                            9&#13;
for improved efficiency and risk management would be provided. In addition, TA to strengthen extension&#13;
and marketing services and other related activities would enhance productivities and profitability of&#13;
agricultural investment. Consequently, it is expected that an increasing number of commercial banks&#13;
would gradually become interested in lending to agriculture as their skills in this area improve, their&#13;
understanding of sector dynamics grows, and as they are given access to external long-term financing.&#13;
2.16         Already one of the major private commercial banks which has satisfied the eligibility&#13;
criteria for participation in the proposed PADP (para. 3.13), has expressed a strong interest in&#13;
diversifying its lending operations to farmers, as well as processors, through participation in the PADP.&#13;
Increased interest in lending to farmers illustrates that quick and large returns from financing short-term&#13;
trading is declining and that banks seeking to stabilize their loan portfolio must diversify their lending.&#13;
2.17         It is recognized that the PADP cannot rely solely on one eligible bank. Other banks&#13;
which satisfy the eligibility criteria would be encouraged to participate both in the credit line and the&#13;
institutional strengthening program to improve their credit management system. The support for the&#13;
ABL, mentioned in the previous section, would also provide a wide ranging institutional development&#13;
program to transform the ABL into an efficiently operating commercial bank with full autonomy. The&#13;
current status of the ABL's compliance with the eligibility criteria is summarized in Annex 4. The ABL&#13;
is expected to become an eligible bank within a short time of loan effectiveness if the Government's stated&#13;
support program is fully implemented. An agreement was reached at negotiations that the GOL will&#13;
complete the recapitalization of the ABL within six months from loan effectiveness. It is expected that&#13;
compliance with a condition of effectiveness--conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with at least&#13;
one PFI--would be met soon after signing of Loan documents.&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER HI&#13;
THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS&#13;
3.1              The main objectives of the project are to assist the Government with the development of a viable,&#13;
private agriculture sector and to foster economic growth in rural areas by providing a combination of financial&#13;
and technical assistance. These objectives would be achieved by addressing some of the key policy and&#13;
institutional constraints through the continuation of ongoing policy dialogue and a comprehensive institutional and&#13;
human resource development program. The main outcomes of the project would be a strengthened rural financial&#13;
intermediation system and the establishment of commercial lending in the agricultural sector. In addition,&#13;
Lithuanian capacities in environmentally sound approaches to agriculture would be strengthened through&#13;
improvement in agricultural extension services, provision of advisory services to agro-processing industries, and&#13;
the training of personnel from PFIs in environmental review methods. Another important objective of the project&#13;

The Project                                                                                  11&#13;
is to alleviate poverty and social difficulties in rural areas due to increasing unemployment. This would be&#13;
achieved through a pilot program at the grassroots level which would provide assistance to the local government&#13;
in identification of alternative employment opportunities, training for the rural labor force in newly required&#13;
skills, and provide direct assistance in preparation of business plans to realize new business opportunities.&#13;
Technical Assistance (TA) for accelerating land reform and improving marketing, extension services, and business&#13;
management skills would enhance the development of private economic activities. Within these broad objectives,&#13;
the main goals of the proposed Private Agriculture Development Project (PADP) are outlined in Box 3.1.&#13;
3.2          The project would complement a Bank financed Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Loan&#13;
which is designed to address more broadly-based financial and enterprise sector issues and more likely to service&#13;
non-farming and large scale enterprises. Consequently, the focus of the proposed project is to assist newly&#13;
emerged private farmers and small scale rural enterprises. Through a pilot program the Project would also&#13;
provide financial and technical assistance, help at grassroots level in identification of alternative employment&#13;
opportunities and training the rural labor force in newly required skills, hence alleviating severe financial and&#13;
social difficulties in rural populations due to increasing unemployment and poverty. Technical assistance for land&#13;
reform, market information, strengthening of extension services, and business management skills would enhance&#13;
the development of the private sector in Lithuanian agriculture.&#13;
3.3          The Droiect has two main components: a Rural Credit Component (RCC) to be supported by the&#13;
Bank through participating financial intermediaries; and an Institutional and Human Resources Development&#13;
Component (IHDC) to be supported by parallel grant cofinancing by donors.&#13;
3.4          The main beneficiaries of the PADP would be: private farmers, agricultural companies, processing&#13;
enterprises, and other rural enterprises involved in marketing, input supply, machinery services, and any other&#13;
rural business closely linked to agriculture. In addition, the IHDC would benefit Governmental and non-&#13;
governmental agencies and participating financial institutions.&#13;
3.5          Program of Targeted Poverty Interventions.  The proportion of the poor among project&#13;
beneficiaries is significantly larger than the national average. The average agricultural wage has declined from&#13;
97% of the national average in 1990 to less than 50% in 1994. The project would support unemployed or&#13;
underemployed in rural areas by training them in alternative skills and market and product information.&#13;
B. THE RURAL CREDIT COMPONENT&#13;
3.6          The Rural Credit Component (RCC) would provide a US $30 million line of credit to&#13;
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) for the financing of eligible subprojects. PFIs would be fully&#13;
autonomous in selection of borrowers, approval of subprojects, and determination of lending terms. Anticipated&#13;
subprojects would include, among others:&#13;
(a)  on-farm investment for development of agricultural production, including the provision of seasonal credit&#13;
or initial working capital as appropriate;&#13;
(b)  investment (including permanent working-capital) for development of processing, storage, packing,&#13;
marketing, and other related agricultural service sectors; and&#13;
(c)  investment in small-scale rural employment and income generating activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                                                       Chapter 3&#13;
3.7          It is expected that roughly half of all lending would go to small farmers and small-scale rural&#13;
entrepreneurs. The monitoring and reporting systems established under the project would provide the necessary&#13;
data for annual reviews of subloan size and use. Agreement has been reached on annual reviews of the loan&#13;
portfolios. A mid-term review would be furnished to the Bank not later than March 31, 1998. All reviews wiU&#13;
focus on the distribution of the subloan beneficiaries and subloan size to verify that they are consistent with&#13;
project lending objectives and expectations. Adjustments would be made to reflect any imbalances.&#13;
3.8          Demand for credit. Demand for credit in Lithuania, particularly for medium- to long-term credit&#13;
is likely to remain high. The aforementioned Farm Survey, and the Agricultural Sector Review, have both&#13;
confirmed that: (a) the agricultural sector has not received, either from public or private sources, any long-term&#13;
investment credits for some time; (b) most of the subsidized credit in the sector has been for short-term credit&#13;
covering about 25% of total credit extended to the sector; and (c) as farms go through structural and ownership&#13;
changes, the requirements of farm restructuring and recapitalization, with the appropriate equipment and fixed&#13;
assets, are considerable. A preliminary estimate taken from the Farm Survey shows that present investment&#13;
requirements in the agricultural sector could be as much as US $200 million at current market rates. Two PFIs&#13;
have expressed their commitment to participate in the proposed project and submitted written commitments with&#13;
estimated disbursement by each PFI under the PADP. It was agreed at negotiatons that if by June 30, 1998,&#13;
at least 50% of the credit line was not committed, the Bank, in consultation with the Borrower, will review&#13;
whether the uncommitted portion of the credit line should be reduced or canceled.&#13;
3.9          Collateral. Although still evolving, a reasonable collateral system exists, based on moveable&#13;
assets. Moveable assets such as equipment, livestock, crops, and fixed assets such as housing, and other real&#13;
estate, are being used as collateral once they are properly registered with local authorities. PFIs, including the&#13;
ABL, would take into account all possible options of securing subloans; this will be a core component in the new&#13;
lending guidelines and training of loan officers for participating PFIs. Similarly, although imperfect due to the&#13;
lengthy procedures involved, the current legal framework provides adequate legal protection for using the above&#13;
collateral, and allows for repossession in case of defaults. A land reform TA component of the proposed project&#13;
would complement the already on-going support provided by several donors, including Swedish TA on the legal&#13;
aspects of land reform.&#13;
3.10         Eligibility Criteria of Subproiects. Subprojects for on-farm development would need to satisfy&#13;
the following eligibility criteria:&#13;
(a) beneficiaries of the RCC must be private investors with a minimum of 51 % private ownership, and&#13;
subprojects must meet eligibility criteria for subprojects; and&#13;
(b) projects must demonstrate a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.3 over the life of the subloan,&#13;
calculated on the basis of the entity's total debts.&#13;
The line of credit would not finance the purchase or lease of land, dwelling construction or improvement, or&#13;
the refinancing of existing debts.&#13;
3.11         Investment subprojects in agro-processing, agro-service or supply, and rural enterprises would&#13;
have to satisfy the eligibility criteria outlined in points (a) and (b) above and would in addition be expected to&#13;
be completed within 18 months from the date of the signature of the subloan agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                                  13&#13;
3.12         Sub-borrowers would be required to make the following contributions towards subproject costs:&#13;
no less than 15 % in cash or in-kind for individual farmers; and no less than 20% in cash or in-kind for all others.&#13;
For new investment by enterprises, the self-contribution in cash or in-kind, would be at least 30%. At&#13;
negotiations an agreement was reached that maximum subloan size (and cumulative subloans to one single&#13;
borrower for the PADP) would be less than US $250, 000. Furthermnore it was agreed that above mentioned&#13;
eligibility criteria for subprojects (paras. 3.10 to 3.12) would be applied during the lifetime of the project.&#13;
3.13         Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Intermediaries. A set of eligibility criteria shall be&#13;
used to determine the suitability of Lithuanian banks for participation in the RCC. To qualify, a PFI must:&#13;
(a)  have an acceptable audit report which covers one full year of operations, incorporates a portfolio review,&#13;
and is prepared by an internationally recognized audit firm in accordance with International Accounting&#13;

14                                                                                    Chapter 3&#13;
Institutional Development Program for the Agriculfure Bank of Lithuania (IDP)&#13;
3.14         Although the IDP has been designed specifically for the ABL, it has also been designed to have&#13;
sufficient breadth to benefit any other eligible banks wishing to participate in the PADP. Training would be&#13;
available for interested PFIs and new lending manuals, guidelines, and training materials would be made available&#13;
as reference materials for other lending institutions as well.&#13;
3.15         The Institutional Development Program for the ABL has two parts as follows:&#13;
(a)    Rural Credit Management would introduce improved rural credit lending guidelines and&#13;
procedures, prepare new lending manuals, and train loan officers. Appropriate training would&#13;
be provided to loan officers in environmental screening as well. This work has already begun&#13;
and the first set of activities is expected to be completed by early Spring 1996. It is expected that&#13;
the new lending guidelines would be applied to the entire ABL lending and not restricted to the&#13;
Bank credit line. At negotiations, an agreement was reached that completion of the new rural&#13;
credit manual acceptable to the Bank and the first round of staff training would be a condition&#13;
for the ABL 's participation as a PFI and that the new lending guidelines would be adopted for&#13;
the ABL's entire lending operations.&#13;
(b)    Comprehensive Institutional Development Program includes twelve key banking areas to be&#13;
supported as follows:&#13;
*     Strategic Planning&#13;
*     Planning, Budgeting and Performance Measurement Process&#13;
*     Organizational Restructuring and Strengthening of Corporate Governance&#13;
*     Human Resource Management&#13;
*     Marketing&#13;
*     Credit Management&#13;
*     Branch Management&#13;
*     Asset and Liability Management&#13;
*     Accounting&#13;
*     Management Information System&#13;
*     Information Technology&#13;
*     Internal Audit&#13;
The above comprehensive IDP program, which has already begun, is planned to be implemented over two years.&#13;
The IDP is being co-financed by EU-PHARE, which would manage the contracting and selection of a twinning&#13;
partner. The twinning arrangement is scheduled to begin in early 1996. The Government's commitment to restore&#13;
full autonomy in the ABL is a pre-condition for EU-PHARE's institutional support for the ABL, and support to&#13;
strengthen the management capacity and the corporate govemance structure would be included in the IDP&#13;
program. At completion of the first two year program, if additional TA is necessary, additional donor financing&#13;
would be sought at that time. To assess the progress and impact of the IDP, a set of indicators for each key area&#13;
of IDP has been developed and would be supervised closely during implementation. The indicators are&#13;
categorized as: (a) financial indicators; (b) governance indicators; (c) management indicators; and (d) process&#13;
indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                                15&#13;
3.16         Prior to and as conditions for negotiations, (a) the Government has prepared and conveyed to&#13;
the Bank the plan and timetable for repairing ABL capital; (b) the Government and the ABL have prepared&#13;
a new lending 'Statement of Policies" which clearly delineates the ABL 's lending principles and criteria, and&#13;
submitted it to the Bank; (c) the ABL prepared and submitted to the Bank TA modules and TOR for the overall&#13;
institutional development program and a clear set of indicators for monitoring the progress of the institutional&#13;
strengthening, including improvement in management.&#13;
3.17         The ABL represents a special case in the use of the Bank financed credit line. Currently the ABL&#13;
is undergoing recapitalization and is in the process of major restructuring, including comprehensive institution&#13;
building, prior to privatization. It is expected that once ABL's capitalization plan has been implemented, it would&#13;
become eligible to intermediate the Bank financed credit line. As part of the capitalization plan, the government&#13;
has obtained parliamentary approval to transfer a portion of funds in the Agricultural Support Fund (para. 2.11)&#13;
into capital. In addition, the Government has already pledged to replace the bank's bad loans with non-negotiable&#13;
government bonds, which would immediately appear as earning assets on the balance sheet. The Government&#13;
has requested that subloans be used to replace an equivalent amount of these government bonds. This process&#13;
would be governed by a Capitalization Finance Agreement between the Government and ABL. In essence, the&#13;
Bank's loan would be used to redeem the bonds for cash, which would simultaneously be used to disburse an&#13;
already approved subloan for intended beneficiaries.  In addition to achieving the recapitalization goal, this&#13;
scheme would also allow the Government to replace one expensive obligation (the bonds held by the ABL) with&#13;
a lower-cost obligation (the repayment of the Bank loan). At negotiations, an understanding was reached that&#13;
only after ABL becomes eligible to participate in the PADP, would funds disbursed under the credit line for&#13;
eligible subloans under the PADP be used by Government to replace bonds issued for the recapitalization of&#13;
the ABL.&#13;
C. THE INSTITUTIONAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
3.18         The Institutional and Human Resource Development Component (IHDC) of the PADP would&#13;
provide technical assistance (TA) to improve the efficiency of the rural institutional framework and create an&#13;
environment conducive to private sector development. The proposed project is designed to trigger necessary&#13;
structural changes and supply responses that would ultimately renew growth of the rural economy. In the short-&#13;
term, however, the structural adjustment associated with transition could result in severe difficulties for the rural&#13;
population due to increasing unemployment and poverty, particularly among women and pensioners. Likewise,&#13;
the continued process of land restitution will result in the creation of many small farms, a significant number of&#13;
which will be unable to generate sufficient income to meet household needs, and would therefore require,&#13;
alternative, off-farm, sources of income would be required. The IHDC has been designed to address these critical&#13;
issues. The key areas of TA are summarized below and detailed terms of references as agreed with the&#13;
Government and concerned donors are available in the Project file. The IHDC component would be financed&#13;
by parallel cofinancing from EU-PHARE and Finland and Sweden (and eventually Denmark and the UK).&#13;
3.19         Land Reform. Substantial TA support for land reform has been provided by several bilateral&#13;
donors. Although the land market is not yet fully in place, land transactions are already taking place based on&#13;
provisional titles. As of December 1995, more than 134,000 private farms have been registered, considerably&#13;
more than in the other Baltic republics. TA shall be undertaken to assist the development of the land cadastre&#13;
maps and the creation of a single land register which would contain all the legally guaranteed information required&#13;
for land transactions to take place. Additional support would be provided to simplify the lengthy procedures and&#13;
information requirements for full titling to expedite the development of land markets. In addition, training would&#13;
be provided for land evaluators for proper valuation of land and also for improved cost recovery by the National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                                                          Chapter 3&#13;
Land Survey Department. This TA support would complement already on-going land reform support provided&#13;
by other donors.&#13;
3.20          Extension System. TA would be provided to assist the development of the whole extension system&#13;
so that extension, research, and education are directed toward farmers' actual needs. TA would also focus on&#13;
improving the flow of information from research and education organizations to the advisory service and farmers.&#13;
3.21          Marketing. TA would be provided to: (a) improve the flow of market information; (b) assist the&#13;
Agricultural Trade Agency in undertaking export promotion and the provision of trade information; (c) assist in&#13;
the development of market institutions; and (d) improve the awareness of, and training in, agricultural and food&#13;
marketing. These TA activities were designed to address several factors which hinder both the domestic and&#13;
export mnarketing of agricultural and food products such as a lack of market institutions and intermediaries, a lack&#13;
of trained marketing professionals, and poor marketing information, including the substandard quality and&#13;
packaging for Western export markets.&#13;
3.22          Business Skills Training. TA programs would be provided to develop and train private farmers&#13;
and managers of ACs in business skills. Private farmers require simple training to understand the profitability,&#13;
cash flow, and capital position of their businesses and subsequent training in the judgment of project feasibility.&#13;
The managers of ACs would be trained in methods to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their businesses&#13;
and in the skills to implement the required changes. Training would include both domestic training and overseas&#13;
study tours.&#13;
3.23          Rural EmDloyment Generation. The Rural Employment Generation Program would help develop&#13;
additional employment in the rural areas. One pilot County has been chosen2, and with the County Government&#13;
as the counterpart, specific TA would be provided as follows: (a) guide potential entrepreneurs through the&#13;
process of business idea identification; (b) assist womens' community groups to establish new enterprises; and&#13;
(c) provide business and management training to newly established enterprises. The proposed Rural Business&#13;
Development Center (see below) would assist potential investors with the preparation of business plans and loan&#13;
applications.&#13;
3.24          Rural Business Development Center (RBC). A non-governmental agency would be created to&#13;
fill the gap in local capacity to assist small- and medium-scale private entrepreneurs, including private farmers.&#13;
The Sector Review, Farm survey, and the survey of local consulting companies identified a lack of quality&#13;
upstream consulting support to assist private farmers and small-scale rural entrepreneurs in conceptualizing&#13;
business ideas and translating them into concrete business plans, is a key bottleneck facing the agriculture sector.&#13;
The RBC would provide such services. International experts would train local consultants for eventual transfer&#13;
of skills to locals experts. Likely clients of the RBC are rural entrepreneurs, processors, ACs, and commercial&#13;
farmers in the rural sector who plan to invest in agriculture-related activities. Details of the RBC's main&#13;
functions, ownership, and operational modalities are in Annex 6.&#13;
2      The Government has selected Telsiai county (comprised of three districts) as the pilot site. The local counterpart is already in&#13;
place and ready to receive the Swedish TA team. The actual work is scheduled to begin in early 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                                        17&#13;
3.25          The RBC would, as a one stop window:&#13;
(a)  provide consulting services to farmers (in coordination with the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Services&#13;
(LAAS)) and interested clients in formulating business ideas and prepare business plans and feasibility&#13;
studies as well as facilitating and enhancing their access to credit;&#13;
(b) provide referral services/and facilitate support from other alternative consulting companies, institutes,&#13;
advisory services in the areas where potential clients are located; and solicit necessary technical expertise&#13;
from relevant agencies or experts;&#13;
(c)  maintain and regularly update a "short-list" of qualified consulting companies, etc; and identify,&#13;
coordinate and organize training of consultants;&#13;
(d)  serve as a window of contact and information on markets, technology, price data, sources of technology,&#13;
equipment, quality inputs and contact points in foreign countries, etc. of all supporting services and&#13;
maintain reference materials including trade magazines, etc.;&#13;
(e)  stimulate rural business development, including providing assistance to workers and farmers seeking&#13;
altemative employment opportunities, or exploring possibilities for income-generating activities; and&#13;
(f)  coordinate the pilot Rural Employment Generation Component (see para. 3.23 above) of the IHDC and&#13;
promote altemative employment opportunities.&#13;
An agreement was reached at negotiaton that the Borrower would maintain the RBC as a separate legal entity&#13;
with statutes, operational guidelines, and staffing acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
D. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.26          As the sector redefines itself, critical questions remain: how to ease the present financial&#13;
constraints and promote private sector investment in the sector; how to expedite land titling and registration; how&#13;
to increase private sector supply of inputs and services to agriculture; and how to promote the scale of adjustment&#13;
necessary to reflect the market equilibrium. The Bank Group's lending strategy in agriculture is to assist the&#13;
government in developing a competitive agriculture sector consistent with its efforts to establish a stable macro-&#13;
economic environment conducive to the development of a market-driven private economy. Experience in other&#13;
countries in similar situations shows that Bank involvement in this project would allow for continuation of the&#13;
sector policy reforms already initiated by the Government. The proposed project is the first operation conceived&#13;
within the above-mentioned strategy to support the emerging private sector.&#13;
3.27          The Government has requested the Bank's assistance in agriculture sector reform. The proposed&#13;
project is the first investment operation in the agricultural sector in Lithuania to be supported by the Bank Group&#13;
and would support the emerging private agricultural sector.3  Market failures stemming from  imperfect&#13;
information flows, inadequate institutional and human resources, and the remaining legacy of past interventionist&#13;
policies have prevented farmers and small-scale entrepreneurs from gaining access to commercial long-term&#13;
3      An Import Rehabilitation Loan for $60 million equivalent has provided some support for importation of needed agricultural&#13;
inputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                                          Chapter 3&#13;
credit. A lack of lending skills and suitable funds has also aggravated the situation. The project would provide&#13;
interim measures to overcome these transitional constraints by providing long-term credits and comprehensive&#13;
institutional and human resource development TA support. In addition to enhancing the financial viability of&#13;
agricultural investment, the project would reduce risks in agricultural lending stemming from lack of collateral,&#13;
high transaction costs, etc. Substantial TA support for participating banks would strengthen the credit delivery&#13;
system to the sector. In addition, EU-PHARE is planning to establish a credit guarantee scheme which would&#13;
be directed at small-scale borrowers. The Bank would also have an instrumental role in coordinating external&#13;
technical assistance. The project would also help strengthen Government policy-making and implementation&#13;
capability at a critical juncture by providing opportunities for policy dialogues. This project is consistent with&#13;
the priorities of private and financial sector development strategies outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
for Lithuania.&#13;
E. STATUS OF PREPARATION&#13;
3.28          The project was prepared by the joint efforts of the Government of Lithuania, concerned&#13;
Ministries, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and grassroots level agencies, with support from foreign&#13;
and local experts. The Bank Group has obtained a Policy and Human Resources Development Grant (PHRD)&#13;
to assist the Government in project preparation, as the PADP is the first investment project for Lithuanian&#13;
agriculture to be supported by the Bank. The Borrower, particularly the Ministry of Agriculture, had lacked&#13;
experience in project preparation. A resident international advisor with extensive World Bank project experience&#13;
was provided, and a large number of short-term consultants in various areas of expertise participated in project&#13;
preparation activities under the guidance of a Lithuanian director.&#13;
3.29          Local Participation. On the Lithuanian side, two working groups were set up by the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture and the Agrarian Committee of the Parliarnent (Seimas) respectively and held a regular briefing&#13;
with the project preparation team to discuss the needs of the agricultural and food sectors and to disseminate&#13;
project-related information. NGOs were also regularly consulted so that the strategy as it developed was&#13;
consistent with the needs of the broad rural constituency.&#13;
3.30          Terms of Reference for the Institutional and Human Resource Development Component were&#13;
drafted on the basis of the needs identified by both public authorities and NGOs, circulated among wide audiences&#13;
for comments, discussed in Committees, and redrafted to target the needs of project beneficiaries. This process&#13;
was repeated until the final TORs were completed. In addition, comments from possible donors have been&#13;
solicited and incorporated until the final financing commitments have been obtained. Throughout the project&#13;
preparation, strong support was received from bilateral donors and the European Union which also sent staff to&#13;
participate in Bank missions. Both Sweden and Finland have conducted fact-finding missions to Lithuania and&#13;
their TA activities have already begun.4 Outlines of each TA program are presented in Annex 7 and detailed&#13;
terms of reference are available in the project files. A Project Implementations Plan prepared by the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture and the PHRD Team, is reproduced as PART II of this SAR.&#13;
4      Sweden and Finland conducted fact-finding missions in Lithuania in October 1995 and a follow up mission by Finland took&#13;
place in November 1995. In addition, the Finnish Government has already initiated training of AC managers by taking them to Finland&#13;
for a study tour in Decenber 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                                          19&#13;
3.31          Farm Survey. From the findings of the Bank-prepared Lithuanian Agricultural and Food Sector&#13;
Review, it was determined that a farm survey was required to identify farmers' requirements for financial and&#13;
technical assistance. The survey was undertaken by the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service (LAAS), the&#13;
Association of Agricultural Companies, and the Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics, with expert advice&#13;
provided by the PHRD team. The sample included both private farms and Agricultural Companies. The results&#13;
of the survey were widely disseminated and debated, and were used by the project preparation tearn to reflect the&#13;
actual conditions and constraints of the potential beneficiaries in project designs. The Survey results are&#13;
summarized in Annex 3.&#13;
F. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.32          The total project cost is estimated at US $54.8 million (LTL 219.2 million). The Bank loan would&#13;
finance 55 % of estimated total project costs, which is equivalent to about 83.3 % of the projected foreign exchange&#13;
component. Donors' parallel cofinancing for about US $8.1 million equivalent would finance 14.8% of total&#13;
project costs. The project costs do not include taxes or duties. Sub-borrowers' contributions have been calculated&#13;
at the minimum levels of 15% and 20%, respectively, for farm credit and agro- and forestry industries. In the&#13;
event that taxes or duties would be levied on any goods financed under the project, the amount of taxes would&#13;
be payable by sub-borrowers, and their participation in the project cost would be increased accordingly. Cost&#13;
estimates are based on preliminary investment plans of sample sub-projects and unit prices currently prevailing&#13;
in Lithuania, and on machinery and equipment price lists from local and international sources. Estimated costs&#13;
are summarized in Table 3.1.&#13;

G. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.33          The Government of Lithuania would be the Borrower of the proposed Bank loan of US $30&#13;
million. The Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Borrower, would channel the Loan proceeds to eligible PFIs&#13;
through the Apex Unit5 (para. 4.10). At negotiations it was agreed that the loan would be a single currency&#13;
loan in US dollars at the Bank's standard LIBOR-based variable interest rate, repayable in twenty years,&#13;
including five years grace.&#13;
5      The Apex unit was created in the Bank of Lithuania under the Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Project.&#13;
&#13;

3.34         Co-Financing Arrangements. EU-PHARE, Finland, and Sweden6 would provide about US $8.1&#13;
million equivalent through parallel co-financing. Additional financing required for project implementation would&#13;
be provided by PFIs and project beneficiaries. The project financing by sources is summarized in Table 3.2.&#13;
H. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.35         Procurement of goods and works would&#13;
be done in accordance with World Bank Guidelines:         Table 3.2: Summary of Financing Plan&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (issued                (S minion)&#13;
in January 1995). For subprojects financed under the  Sources          Total      % of total&#13;
World Bank's credit line and executed by sub-borrowers,&#13;
procurement procedures would comply  with those    IBRD                30.0        54.8&#13;
customary for operations through financial intermediaries.  Donors      8.1         14.8&#13;
Recent Bank reviews of procurement practices (May     Fincial&#13;
1995) determined that reasonably acceptable commercial    Intermediaries&#13;
practices are applied by the private sector and that&#13;
Lithuanian companies do seek competitive prices from  Sub-Borrowers     9.5         17.3&#13;
different suppliers and different countries. Funds from the  Total     54.8        100.0&#13;
credit line would be utilized by a large number of many&#13;
small and medium-size private farmers and enterprises.&#13;
Given that the majority of subloans are expected to be small (with an average size less than US $50,000&#13;
equivalent), for a large number of individual borrowers, and the variety of goods to be procured, grouping or&#13;
orders in bid packages would not possible. Goods expected to be procured and financed under the project would&#13;
include agricultural machinery, livestock, building materials, processing equipment, seeds, fertilizer, pesticides,&#13;
and other farm inputs.&#13;
3.36         Procurement Methods. The participating financial institutions and the RBC would advise project&#13;
beneficiaries on appropriate procurement methods and ensure that all goods and works financed under the project&#13;
are procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. Subprojects&#13;
would be financed in part by the Bank credit line and in part by local participating banks and final beneficiaries'&#13;
own funds. Therefore, subproject size will exceed subloan amount. Based on this, the procurement thresholds&#13;
as follows would apply: (a) goods and works estimated to cost the equivalent of less than US $100,000 per&#13;
contract, would be procured in accordance with nornal commercial procurement practices; and (b) goods and&#13;
works valued up to US $500,000 per contract would be procured through International Shopping (IS) on the basis&#13;
of at least three price quotations from two different countries. Although not expected to be applicable for this&#13;
project, any contract above US $500,000 would be procured under international competitive bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures. Direct contracting' may be used for proprietary items and those available only from a single supplier&#13;
for each contract with an estimated cost under US $50,000. The use of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents:&#13;
Procurement of Goods (January 1995) would be mandatory for all ICB procurement.&#13;
3.37         Prior review by the Bank of procurement documentation would be carried out for the first two&#13;
contracts proposed to be procured under International Shopping procedures, and submitted by each participating&#13;
financial institutions, for all contracts, if any, to be procured under ICB. The Bank conducted a procurement&#13;
seminar in Lithuania in May 1995. Soon after loan approval and before loan effectiveness, the Bank would&#13;
6     Denmark and the UK have also expressed interest in becoming co-financiers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                                    21&#13;
conduct a project launch workshop which would include training sessions on procurement specifically for the staff&#13;
of the PMU, RBC, and the PFIs. The PMU would be responsible for ensuring that the PFIs and subborrowers&#13;
would adhere to Bank procurement guidelines, and this would be monitored by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
Training on Bank procurement practices would be repeated as necessary. The semi-annual progress report would&#13;
contain a summary on procurement activities.&#13;
3.38         Expected aggregate amounts for procurement of goods and services financed from the credit line&#13;
are US $15 million, using commercial procurement practices, and US $15 million, applying International&#13;
Shopping procedures indicated above. As the entire IHDC is being financed by donors, all goods and services&#13;
would be procured in accordance with the regulations and practices of each donor agency.&#13;
I. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.39         Disbursements would be administered by the APEX Unit in coordination with the PMU. The&#13;
PMU would collect and compile the necessary documentation for withdrawal of the funds from the credit line&#13;
from the PFIs. The proposed Bank loan of US $30 million would be disbursed over a period of five years (1996-&#13;
2000), and the expected project closing date would be June 30, 2001. A midterm evaluation would be undertaken&#13;
by the Bank and the Borrower approximately six months after the second annual review or when the disbursement&#13;
reaches 50% of the total loan amount, whichever is earlier, to examine the pace of project implementation and&#13;
to carry out a preliminary assessment of the project's benefits and impact. A schedule of the estimated&#13;
disbursements of the proposed Bank loan is shown at Annex 11.&#13;
3.40         Retroactive Financing. An agreement was reached at negotiations that up to US $2.5 mnllion&#13;
would be financed retroactively for eligible subloans approved and disbursed by PFIs starting from October&#13;
1995, provided all lending criteria and procurement guidelines were followed. Retroactive financing would be&#13;
justified since: (a) PFIs under considerations are active in lending but lack long-term credit sources; (b) training&#13;
program for PFIs is already in place, and several potential investment proposals submitted during project&#13;
preparation are under review. Evaluation of these proposals, although not guaranteed to receive credit through&#13;
the Bank loan, would provide important hands-on training opportunities; and (c) a pilot program of rural&#13;
employment generation (para 3.23), scheduled to begin in early 1996, could generate possible subprojects which&#13;
could be eligible for financing under the proposed project.&#13;
3.41          Disbursement Ratios. Notwithstanding the disbursement percentages shown in Table 3.3, the&#13;
maximum amount to be withdrawn by the&#13;
borrower and made available to the PFIs would&#13;
be as follows: 100%  of eligible subloans&#13;
approved in the first 18 months, 85%  of                     Table 3.3: Disbursements&#13;
eligible subloans approved in the following 12  Category          Allocation    % of expenditures to be&#13;
months, and 75 % of eligible subloans approved                   (US $ mil)       financed&#13;
in  the  remaining  period  of  project       1. O               15.0       100% of foreign&#13;
implementation (see para. 3.42 for definition of  development               expenditures, 100% of&#13;
periods). These disbursement ratios are justified    . .   .                local expenditures (ex-&#13;
because some of the financial intermediaries  2. Processg industries  15.0  factory cost) and 80% of&#13;
expected to participate in the project would not  and rural enterprises    local expenditures for other&#13;
be in a position to raise internal long-term  Total              30.0      items procured locally.&#13;
resources at the inception of their lending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                                                                    Chapter 3&#13;
operations under the project, and because some already existing institutions are in the process of building up their&#13;
capital base. With the build-up of equity and with other funds becoming available during project implementation,&#13;
the intermediaries' share would gradually increase up to 25 % of subloan amounts to be approved. Disbursements&#13;
for the TA component would follow donors' own regulations (see Table 3.3).&#13;
3.42         Definition of Periods. For the purpose of applying the disbursement percentages indicated in para.&#13;
3.41, the first 18 months represent the period beginning on the dates that each of the PFIs have signed their first&#13;
subloan after the project becomes effective. The percentage calculation was based on the assumption that about&#13;
25% of subloans would be approved during the first 18 months, 30% in the successive 12 months, and 45% in&#13;
the remaining implementation period. Various indicators, including the farm survey carried out during project&#13;
preparation, show that the demand for credit is considerably higher than the proposed loan amount; therefore,&#13;
it is reasonable to assume that the proposed project could be implemented in less than five years. Agreement was&#13;
reached during negotiations that the disbursement percentages (as indicated in paras. 3.41 and 3.42) would be&#13;
stipulated in the subsidiary loan agreements to be signed between the borrower and each PFI.&#13;
3.43         Withdrawal Application. All withdrawal applications for Category I and Category II would be&#13;
made on the basis of certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), except for contracts above US $200,000, for&#13;
which withdrawals would be based on full documentation. All supporting documentation would be retained by&#13;
the Apex and the PFIs for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the&#13;
last disbursement was made. The documentation would be made available for review by the auditors and by&#13;
visiting Bank missions. The minimum application size for direct payments will be 20% of the current amount&#13;
of authorized allocation to the Special Account.&#13;
3.44         Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special&#13;
Account in one of the major foreign commercial banks on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover&#13;
the Bank's share of expenditures. The initial allocation to the Special Account would be limited to US $1.5&#13;
million. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Loan have reached the level of US $4 million,&#13;
the Authorized Allocation could be increased to US $2 million (the maximum amount authorized) by submitting&#13;
the relevant Application for withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be&#13;
submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier.&#13;
Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedures. The terms and&#13;
conditions of the establishment and operation of the Special Account were agreed upon at negotiations.&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER IV&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
Project Management Unit&#13;
4.1          The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), through a joint World Bank and EU Project Management&#13;
Unit (PMU), would be responsible for coordinating project implementation. Through TA support for the PMU,&#13;
the proposed project would strengthen MOA's capacity for project management and coordination of donor-&#13;
financed TA activities. The PMU would be headed by a director at the level of Deputy Minister and staffed with&#13;
personnel who possess adequate technical and professional skills. In addition, a long-term resident advisor would&#13;
assist the PMU director for the duration of the project implementation. The necessary training in World Bank&#13;
procurement and disbursement procedures, monitoring, and evaluation, would be provided for PMU staff.&#13;
4.2          The main functions of the PMU would be the following:&#13;
(a) to ensure that project implementation is consistent with the stated project objectives and the eligibility&#13;
criteria for subborrowers and subprojects, and complies with the World Bank guidelines for procurement&#13;
and environmental impact;&#13;
(b) to coordinate inter-governmental activities associated with execution of the project and to liaise with the&#13;
APEX Unit (see para. 4.10) of BOL, MOF, and other relevant government and NGO agencies;&#13;
(c) to monitor PFIs and the Rural Business Development Center (RBC) to ensure that their activities are&#13;
consistent with the project objectives;&#13;
(d)  to compile necessary documentation for submission to the APEX Unit, to facilitate disbursements,&#13;
including submitting appropriate documents for replenishment of the Special Account;&#13;
(e) to coordinate, supervise, monitor, and evaluate all TA activities under the project, including finalization&#13;
of TORs; the coordination of contract tendering; and the selection of consultants;&#13;
(f) to prioritize TA requirements and to identify specific activities to be supported for the sector and program&#13;
future ones;&#13;
(g) to ensure that audits of the project account, accounts of the PFIs, and accounts of the RBC are carried&#13;
out according to agreements with the Bank;&#13;
(h) to prepare, with inputs from PFIs, the APEX Unit, and the RBC, semi-annual progress reports to be&#13;
submitted to the Bank in accordance with agreed reporting format and monitoring indicators; and&#13;
(i)  to assure that the project would be executed in conformity with policies established by the Government.&#13;
4.3          The joint Bank/EU PMU is already in place, in the Ministry of Agriculture. The joint Bank/EU&#13;
PMU would, in addition to the PADP, continue to implement the existing EU-PHARE and other donor financed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                                                                              Chapter 4&#13;
agriculture TA programs. Because effective project management is critical to the successftil outcome of the&#13;
project, PMU performance would be closely evaluated during project supervision, and any inadequacies identified&#13;
would be remedied. An agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government would maintain the PMU&#13;
for the lifetime of the PADP and take appropriate actions as may be needed from time to time based on regular&#13;
consultation with the Bank to strengthen the PMU as necessary.&#13;

Project Implementation                                                                      25&#13;
4.4          Each TA program of the Institutional and Human Resources Development Component (IHDC)&#13;
of the project would be implemented by a specific counterpart under the supervision of a relevant steering&#13;
committee (Table 4.1). The PMU would coordinate implementation and execution of the IHDC with donors and&#13;
the Bank. Under the parallel co-financing agreements, each donor (PHARE, Finland, and Sweden) would follow&#13;
its own rules and regulations regarding contracting, procurement, and disbursement. The Borrower, donors, and&#13;
the Bank would closely coordinate with each other during TOR preparation, short-listing, and selection of&#13;
consultants. Implementation of the IHDC would be jointly supervised by the Bank and co-financiers to the extent&#13;
possible, and all relevant communications, reports, etc., would be shared among all parties.&#13;
Rural Business Development Center (RBC)&#13;
4.5          The Rural Business Development Center would be established to provide support for newly&#13;
emerging rural business people and investors (see Annex 6 for details).&#13;
4.6          Ownership and Organization. Initially the RBC would be owned by non-governmental associations&#13;
(Associations of ACs and processing industries, and the Farmers Union, etc.) which would benefit from the work&#13;
of the RBC. The RBC would be guided by a governing board, consisting of members from the owners and project&#13;
beneficiaries. The RBC would be headed by a Lithuanian General Manager whose main task would be to ensure&#13;
that the RBC programn of activities and business plan, as agreed by its governing board, is implemented in a&#13;
professional manner. During the initial period of operation, the RBC would have a staff of about five to six&#13;
persons specializing in food marketing, financial analysis, and engineering. In addition, the technical assistance&#13;
program would provide long-term foreign consulting services to the unit, with focus on training the Lithuanian&#13;
staff in undertaking market and feasibility studies. EU-PHARE already has long-term advisors in place to support&#13;
the unit and would compliment these advisors with short-term consultants as specific needs arise.&#13;
4.7          Financing of Operations. The RBC would charge private investors for its services. However, full&#13;
cost recovery during the first and second year of operation is unlikely, since the RBC would also undertake&#13;
nonrevenue-generating public good activities. The Ministry of Agriculture has allocated counterpart funds from&#13;
the EU (up to LTL 800,000) during the initial years of operation to cover the gap between operating cost and&#13;
expected revenues.&#13;
4.8          Coordination of Rural Employment Generation Program. In addition to its main functions (as&#13;
in para 3.25), the RBC, in coordination with a pilot county government would assist the Swedish TA team's&#13;
effort in transforming alternative income/employment generating possibilities into concrete business plans. These&#13;
business ideas, once fully documented, would be forwarded to participating financial intermediaries (or other&#13;
banks) for possible funding. This pilot program is designed to link necessary support from the identification -&#13;
conceptualization stage to the final realization of the investment. Once the results of the first phase pilot program&#13;
are available, the scope and coverage of the program would be expanded to additional districts. Donors have&#13;
expressed interest in additional support for such an expanded program, pending the results of the pilot program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                                                                                    Chapter 4&#13;
B. CREDIT OPERATIONS'&#13;
4.9          Institutional Arrangements. The MOF, through the APEX Unit, would on-lend the credit line&#13;
funds to the ABL and other PFIs that would meet the eligibility criteria (para. 3.13). Conclusion of a Fiscal&#13;
Agency Agreement between the MOF and the BOL would be a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
4.10         The APEX Unit. The APEX Unit in the BOL, which is already in place, would manage&#13;
channeling of the credit line funds to eligible PFIs for a fee. PFIs would in turn extend subloans to ultimate&#13;
beneficiaries. The specific activities to be performed by the APEX Unit would include the following:&#13;
(a)  maintenance of the Loan Account, Special Account, and the consolidated Project Accounts;&#13;
(b)  consolidation of reimbursement applications received from the PFIs, through the PMU, submission of&#13;
withdrawal applications to the World Bank, on-lending and channelling of the Loan funds to the PFIs,&#13;
and maintenance of adequate records of all project related expenditures;&#13;
(c)  maintenance of the loan accounts for the respective share of the Loan on-lent to each PFI, and collection&#13;
of principal, interest and other charges, that are payable by the PFIs in accordance with the terms and&#13;
conditions stipulated in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements;&#13;
(d)  assurance of compliance with audit requirements in coordination with the MOF and PMU;&#13;
(e)  provision to MOF, the PMU, and the Bank of any information on the above activities according to the&#13;
agreed reporting format and requirement; and&#13;
(f)  The APEX Unit would work closely with the BOL's Bank Supervision Department in assessing the initial&#13;
and continuing compliance of participating banks with the Bank's eligibility criteria.  This&#13;
notwithstanding, final determination of bank's eligibility to enter and continue to participate in the PADP&#13;
would rest with the Bank of Lithuania Banking Supervision Department, subject to World Bank approval.&#13;
At negotiations, an agreement was reached that the Bank of Lithuania would maintain the APEX to carry out&#13;
the service arrangements described above and in accordance with the terms of the Fiscal Agency Agreement;&#13;
and that the fee payable to the APEX for its services would be 0.25% and would be reviewed semi-annually.&#13;
4.11         Subsidiary Loan Agreements. Each PFI would sign a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the Apex&#13;
Unit on behalf of MOF, satisfactory to the Bank. This agreement would, inter alia, specify that the PFI would&#13;
do the following:&#13;
(a)  set own final on-lending rates to ultimate beneficiaries based on cost of borrowing and lending risks;&#13;
(b)  undertake lending operations in accordance with lending guidelines and procedures acceptable to the&#13;
MOF, BOL and the Bank;&#13;
Subsidiary Loan = Loan from the Ministry of Finance to a participating financial intermediary (PFI).&#13;
Subloan = Loan from PFIs to ultimate beneficiary (i.e. subborrower).&#13;

Project Implementation                                                                          27&#13;
(c)  submit to the Bank for prior review the first three subloan proposals, irrespective of the subloan size, and&#13;
any additional subloan proposal in excess of US $200,000 equivalent;&#13;
(d)  ensure that funds provided under project-financed subloans are used by the sub-borrowers for the&#13;
purposes intended and that appropriate procurement procedures are followed;&#13;
(e)  ensure and supervise compliance that sub-borrowers using project funds would comply with all laws and&#13;
regulations of Lithuania related to environmental protection;&#13;
(f)  supervise subprojects, as appropriate, and provide the APEX Unit, the PMU, and the Bank with periodic&#13;
reports on the status of subprojects and subloans, including information on loan recovery performance;&#13;
(g)  provide the APEX Unit, PMU, and the Bank with such information as they may reasonably request; and&#13;
(h)  maintain all necessary subproject and subloan documentation.&#13;
Conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the APEX unit on behalf of the MOF and at least one&#13;
PFI would be a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
4.12          ADpraisal Methodologv. Subloan applications for investments would be carefully evaluated based&#13;
on the submission of detailed feasibility studies. These studies would cover the following:&#13;
(a)   The technical feasibility, financial viability, and commercial soundness of the proposed investment.&#13;
Particular emphasis would be placed on assessing the marketing possibilities for the incremental&#13;
production of the subproject;&#13;
(b)  The economic justification of the proposed investment, including an assessment of the competitiveness&#13;
of the end-product compared to imports;&#13;
(c)   An evaluation of the proposed scale of the subproject, the need and adequacy of the civil works and&#13;
equipment to be procured, the location of the enterprise, its layout and design, and the estimated&#13;
investment costs in domestic and foreign currencies; and an assessment of compliance with pollution&#13;
control and other environmental protection guidelines set by the authorities; and&#13;
(d)  an evaluation of the sub-borrower's ownership structure (at least 51 % private), creditworthiness,&#13;
organization, management, and financial position, and an evaluation of the technical staff and know-how&#13;
available for implementing the subproject and its operation;&#13;
(e)  certification from the relevant local or national authorities that the proposed sub-project meets all&#13;
environmental laws and standards in force in Lithuania, and that no safety hazard or environmental&#13;
deterioration would result, directly or indirectly, from the investment sub-project to be financed under&#13;
the project.&#13;
4.13          Simplified appraisal procedures would be applied to subprojects with an estimated cost not&#13;
exceeding US $100,000 equivalent for replacement of machinery and equipment, or for modernization, expansion,&#13;
etc. These simplified procedures would include, as applicable:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                                                    Chapter 4&#13;
(a)  review and assessment of the viability and financial soundness of the enterprise and its capacity to service&#13;
the subloan; and&#13;
(b)  the technical verification that the equipment, materials, and spare parts to be purchased are appropriate&#13;
and are intended to be used in the existing production process to alleviate any existing production&#13;
bottlenecks, increase efficiency of the existing process, or contribute to improving quality and meet higher&#13;
product standards.&#13;
An agreement was reached at negotiations that PFIs would comply with the appraisal procedures as outlined&#13;
in paras. 4.12 and 4.13.&#13;
Terms and Conditions of Financing&#13;
4.14            Choice of Currency: The Borrower has decided that the Loan from the Bank would be a LIBOR-&#13;
based Single Currency Loan (SCL) in US dollars at the Bank's standard variable interest rate payable in twenty&#13;
years with five years grace.&#13;
4.15            On-lending Arrangement. The MOF, on behalf of the Borrower, would on-lend the proceeds of&#13;
the Loan to PFIs, through the APEX unit in the Bank of Lithuania (Para. 4.10), either in US or in local&#13;
currency, according to the demand for the respective currencies from the sub-borrowers, which are the ultimate&#13;
project beneficiaries. Final beneficiaries will make the repayments in the currency in which subloans were&#13;
denominated.&#13;
4.16            On-lending rates and Intermediation Spreads.  Agreed intermediation spreads are outlined in&#13;
Table 4.2 below. These spreads would be added to the Bank's variable interest rates for the different types of&#13;
single currency loans. The spread will be reviewed from time to time during project implementation. Such&#13;
reviews will take into account cost and risk considerations and the cost of borrowing.&#13;
Table 4.2: Intermediation Spreads&#13;
Transaction                          Proposed Spread (Percent)          Rationale&#13;
1. From MOF to APEX                  (a) 0.5 % for MOF                  To compensate the Government for the&#13;
(above the relevant Bank rate-para.  commitment charges and other&#13;
4.16)                              administration cost of the project&#13;
(b) 1.0 % for risk premium         To cover the risk of non-repayment by PFIs&#13;
2. From APEX to PFIs                 0.25%                              To cover the direct operational cost of the&#13;
APEX&#13;
3. From PFIs to Final Borrowers      Variable rate based on risk assessment    To maintain autonomy of PFIs to set final&#13;
and transaction cost               lending rates&#13;
4.17            The Bank has suggested to the Government that the 1 % spread (Table 4.2(1.b)) be placed by the&#13;
MOF in an escrow account similar to the one already established for the Enterprise and Financial Sector&#13;
Assistance Project (EFSAP). The escrow account would earn interest over the life of the Loan and would be used&#13;
to cover any defaults by PFIs in their repayment of principal and interest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation                                                                       29&#13;
4.18         Lending in Local Currency. The on-lending interest rate charged by MOF/APEX Unit to the&#13;
PFIs on subsidiary loans denominated in local currency would be variable, and would be based on GOL Treasury&#13;
Bonds rate (or other relevant reference rates to be agreed upon between the MOF and the Bank) - plus the&#13;
intermediation spreads as above. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risks on the portion of the&#13;
loan on-lent to PFIs in local currency and charge a margin adequate to cover these risks.&#13;
4.19         Terms and Conditions of Subloans to Final Beneficiaries. The PFIs would make subloans to&#13;
ultimate beneficiaries denominated and repayable in either Litas or US dollars, as determined by each sub-&#13;
borrower at the time of signing the subloan agreement with the PFI. Subborrowers would be required to repay&#13;
the subloan in the currency in which it was disbursed. The interest rates on subloans to be charged by PFIs&#13;
would be variable, and would be based on the cost of funds paid by PFIs (subject to periodic review as mentioned&#13;
above) and the spread determined by PFIs, which would be based on their risk assessment and lending costs in&#13;
each case. PFIs would have full autonomy in loan approval and would bear the lending risks. All interest rates&#13;
on subloans would be positive in real terms.&#13;
4.20         Repavment Schedules. Repayment schedules of funds on-lent (the "subsidiary loans") to the PFIs&#13;
would be based on the amortization schedule of the Bank loan. The subsidiary loans would be repaid over a&#13;
period not to exceed 15 years, including a grace period not to exceed three years. Repayment schedules of&#13;
project-financed subloans would have terms of up to 12 years, inclusive of grace periods of up to three years.&#13;
Grace and amortization periods would be based on the type of investment financed and the projected cash flow,&#13;
and would be commensurate with the repayment capacity of sub-borrowers. However, in no case would&#13;
repayment periods exceed the useful life of the investment financed. Any amount of principal repaid by sub-&#13;
borrowers to PFIs, which are not immediately needed for repayment of the subsidiary loan to the APEX Unit,&#13;
would be kept in separate rollover accounts (one account for subsidiary loans in US dollars and one for loans in&#13;
Litas) to be maintained by each PFI. Fund from this rollover account could be utilized by PFIs to finance&#13;
additional investments aimed at pursuing the objectives of the project, and which conform to the agreed terms,&#13;
conditions, and eligibility criteria for the project.&#13;
4.21         Subloan Processing and Administration. PFIs would be responsible for identifying prospective&#13;
sub-borrowers and for determining the type of subproject to be financed, and for following the eligibility criteria&#13;
for investments and subloan beneficiaries as described above. Subloan applications, farm plans, feasibility&#13;
studies, etc., would generally be prepared by subloan applicants with assistance of the PFIs' specialized&#13;
agricultural credit officers and, as appropriate, advisers of the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Services (LAAS),&#13;
in accordance with the PFIs' lending procedures and the arrangements for cooperation established between PFIs&#13;
and LAAS. For agro-processing, agro-services, and other rural enterprises, subloan applicants would prepare&#13;
subloan applications, feasibility studies, etc., with assistance by RBC as necessary, which would be appraised by&#13;
the respective PFI. In all cases, authority for subloan approval would rest solely with the PFI, which would have&#13;
full autonomy to approve or reject subloan applications.&#13;
4.22         At negotiations, agreements were reached on the termns and conditions of financing (para. 4.14-&#13;
4.21) including the choice of currencies, intermediation spreads, and on-lending terms and conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                                                   Chapter 4&#13;
C. ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT&#13;
4.23         The Borrower would be responsible for appropriate accounting for the funds provided by the Bank&#13;
under the project and for ensuring that audits of the project-related financial statements are carried out by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and submitted to the Bank. The APEX Unit, on behalf of the&#13;
Borrower, would establish appropriate accounting systems to provide information on the proper receipt and use&#13;
of the funds in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The accounting for all Special Account transactions and&#13;
for all other project-related accounts would be maintained in accordance with IAS. PFIs would maintain accounts&#13;
for subloans and retain all documents supporting procurement and disbursements.&#13;
4.24         Accounts of the APEX Unit relating to the PADP and accounts of each PFI would be audited for&#13;
each financial year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and audit reports would be submitted to the&#13;
Bank no later than six months after the close of each financial year. These audits would be in accordance with&#13;
IAS and would also conform with requirements of the MOF and the BOL. The audit of the APEX Unit accounts&#13;
would also include separate opinions, in accordance with Bank Guidelines, on the Special Account and Statement&#13;
of Expenditure. Audits of PFIs' accounts would include an opinion of the auditors on compliance by the PFI with&#13;
the provisions of the subsidiary loan agreement. At negotiations, assurances were obtained on compliance with&#13;
the accounting and auditing requirements in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
D. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.25         The PMU, in cooperation with the PFIs, RBC, and the APEX Unit would be responsible for&#13;
monitoring and evaluating the impact of the project (see Annex 13). The PFIs would supervise the physical and&#13;
financial subproject implementation at the farm or enterprise level, and the economic and financial performance&#13;
of sub-borrowers through field visits and review of documents, invoices, financial statements, and key indicators&#13;
provided by sub-borrowers. The PMU would identify bottlenecks, problems, and constraints affecting project&#13;
implementation and the project's expected impact and results, and would take the remedial actions considered&#13;
necessary. The PMU would be responsible for ensuring that the PFIs and subborrowers adhere to Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines, and this would be monitored by Bank supervision missions. Training on Bank&#13;
procurement would be provided as necessary. The PMU would closely monitor the implementation of the&#13;
Institutional and Human Resource Development Component and keep the Bank informed of its findings and the&#13;
actions taken or proposed to be taken. At negotiations, an agreement was reached that the Borrower, with the&#13;
Bank, would carry out annual reviews of the PMU, APEX, RBC, and PFIs. Furthermore it was agreed that&#13;
the Borrower would bear the responsibilities for implementation and supervision of the TA activities in a&#13;
manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
4.26         Based on information collected from the PFIs, RBC, and APEX Unit the PMU would prepare&#13;
semi-annual progress reports (end-June and end-December), which would be submitted to the Bank and the&#13;
Borrower within 30 days after the end of the period under review. These reports would include a copy of the&#13;
project Account, a summary statement of the financial status of the project and the Bank loan, procurement&#13;
activities, and a brief descriptive section on the physical implementation of subprojects and on the problems&#13;
encountered and remedial actions taken during implementation.&#13;
4.27         Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Soon after completion of the project, but no later than&#13;
six months after the closing date, the PMU, with collaboration of the MOF, the PFIs, RBC, and the APEX Unit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation                                                                      31&#13;
would prepare and furnish to the Bank the required data, as would be requested and prescribed by the Bank, for&#13;
preparation of an ICR. Inter alia, the information to be submitted to the Bank would also include an assessment&#13;
of the performance of the various participating institutions and agencies in discharging their respective functions&#13;
and obligations under the project. At negotiations an agreement was reached on compliance with the reporting&#13;
requirements.&#13;
E. SUPERVISION&#13;
4.28         Due to the extensive TA in the PADP, supervision requirements are expected to be greater than&#13;
average. The proposed plan for project supervision by the Bank envisages at least three supervision missions&#13;
during each of the first two years after loan approval by the Bank, and two Bank missions in each of the&#13;
subsequent years. The skills mix of supervision staff would ensure an adequate presence of agriculturists,&#13;
agricultural economists, banking and agricultural credit specialists, financial analysts, and experts in Bank&#13;
procurement and disbursement rules and procedures. A start-up supervision and a project launch seminar is&#13;
planned immediately after signing of the loan. A midterm review would be carried out by March 31, 1998, at&#13;
which time an in-depth review of overall progress towards meeting project objectives would be made. Annex 12&#13;
describes the proposed supervision arrangements in more detail.&#13;
4.29         The Bank's supervision would focus particularly on reviewing: (a) PFIs' performance in project&#13;
implementation; (b) technical assistance activities financed by various donor agencies; (c) progress by PFIs' in&#13;
implementation of the overall institutional development program and its impact; (d) the performance of the APEX&#13;
Unit in BOL, the PMU, and the RBC; (e) the cooperation between the all PFIs and other agencies; and (f) the&#13;
coordination of project supervision according to the GOL's schedule as specified in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan (PIP), attached as Part II of this report. Co-financiers would be invited to join the Bank supervision and&#13;
all communication included in the supervision/reporting would be exchanged between the Bank, co-financiers,&#13;
and the Borrower. In addition, Bank supervision would also review the performance of the agriculture sector&#13;
in general, GOL's progress in privatization, progress by Government in phasing out of subsidized credit, and&#13;
assess Government-supported programs for the agriculture sector and their impact on the sector and on the&#13;
project.&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.30         An environmental review was prepared for the proposed project consistent with the requirements&#13;
of Lithuanian environmental assessment legislation and the provisions of the World Bank. According to&#13;
Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment," the project has placed in environmental screening&#13;
category "B." The proposed project is expected to result in environmental benefits by supporting a series of&#13;
small-scale improvements in a wide range of agricultural practices, as recommended by the extension service,&#13;
LAAS.&#13;
4.31         The GOL has enacted the laws and regulations concerning sustainable agricultural practices,&#13;
including new guidelines on the use of pesticides. In order to respond to the increasing need for environmentally&#13;
sustainable agricultural practices, the MOA has recently established a Committee for Environmental Issues.&#13;
Among the first topics to be addressed is a comprehensive review of the implementation of the removal and&#13;
destruction of obsolete pesticides, and further review of the present list of approved pesticides. In this effort, the&#13;
MOA is following international standards including use of the World Health Organization classification.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                                                       Chapter 4&#13;
4.32         The Ministry of Agriculture continues its support for farmer training and requires certification&#13;
of pesticide users, but this program is increasingly hampered by the high cost of protective clothing and the lack&#13;
of training material. Training is provided by LAAS, the Plant Protection Department, or local agricultural&#13;
schools. This year the Plant Protection Department has sent its first staff member overseas for training in&#13;
integrated pest management.&#13;
4.33          Environmental Screening and Review Procedures. Where applicable, investments financed under&#13;
the proposed project would require issuance of permits consistent with the applicable Lithuanian land use and&#13;
environmental procedures (see Annex 8). Because of the generally small size of investments to be supported&#13;
under the project, the primary responsibility for environmental monitoring for the project would rest with the&#13;
local governments. Few, if any, investments or special cases are envisaged that would require review by regional&#13;
offices. The basic procedures for screening of small-scale investments are well established and documented in&#13;
recent decrees and regulations (decree 87 of 12/17/90; regulations # 153-93 and decree 154-60 of 8/31/93). These&#13;
rules are mainly aimed at larger investments, but where applicable, the rules would be used to ascertain&#13;
consideration of proper environmental standards for preservation of the top soil, solid and liquid waste&#13;
management, and for proper management of drainage and runoff. The rules also cover assessment and&#13;
management of the impact of agricultural production-related investments (such as workshops and storage units),&#13;
on groundwater quality, trees, shrubs, and plant life, and wildlife and fish. These rules are also intended to&#13;
ascertain proper construction standards. All infrastructure investment lending under the project would require&#13;
permits.&#13;
4.34          Investments in, or near, protected areas would require special review in the regional offices of&#13;
the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Such special reviews include those made in the "intensive karst zone"&#13;
targeted by the Government for Ground Water Protection and Sustainable Agricultural Development (Birzai and&#13;
Pasvalys Districts).&#13;
4.35         The project would emphasize environmentally sound and sustainable agricultural development&#13;
through strengthening institutional capacity as follows: (a) strengthening of agricultural extension services,&#13;
including continued training of extension personnel, and subsequently farmers, in appropriate pest management&#13;
practices, including integrated pest management and proper handling of agro-chemicals; (b) providing advisory&#13;
services to the agro-processing industries that would stress the use of environmentally sound practices and&#13;
technologies; and, (c) training of personnel from PFIs in the environmental risk assessment of small-scale&#13;
investments in agriculture and agro-processing. An agreement on compliance with envronmental standards&#13;
acceptable to the Bank was reached during negotiatons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER V&#13;
BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATIONS&#13;
5.1          The project would contribute toward the creation of a sound rural financing system while&#13;
complementing the Bank's on-going effort in banking sector reforms. The project would, through&#13;
continuous policy dialogue and a wide range of technical assistance activities, alleviate key policy and&#13;
institutional constraints that hamper the adjustments necessary for complete transition to a market&#13;
economy.  The credit line provided under the project would finance private economic activity and&#13;
stimulate a supply response. Improved productivity and environmental management of primary and&#13;
processing enterprises are another consequence of the project, together with increased competitiveness&#13;
and enhanced marketability of Lithuanian products. Through a pilot program, the project would, at a&#13;
grass-roots level, provide support for identification of alternative income opportunities and the&#13;
corresponding training to pursue those opportunities. Such efforts would help combat the growing rural&#13;
poverty and unemployment which disproportionately affects women. After a successful pilot period, this&#13;
program would be expanded nation-wide. Other benefits include improvements in marketing capacity,&#13;
linkage between research and extension, and training in business and management skills.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVALUATIONS&#13;
5.2          Consistency with the CAS. The proposed project is consistent with the Bank's overall&#13;
priorities for private and financial sector development strategies outlined in the CAS and as agreed with&#13;
the Lithuanian Government. Key sectoral issues and development strategies were identified during the&#13;
Bank's Agriculture and Food Sector Review', and have been incorporated in the project design.&#13;
5.3          Adeguate Polio Environment. Notwithstanding the remaining areas of required policy&#13;
reforms, the Government of Lithuania has made considerable progress both on macro-economic and&#13;
sector policy fronts (see Chapter 1 for more details) which in turn provides an adequate policy&#13;
environment to facilitate development of private activities in rural areas.&#13;
5.4          Alternative Options during the Transition Period. Perceptions of high risk in lending to&#13;
agriculture, inadequate institutional and human resources, and the remaining legacy of past interventionist&#13;
policies have prevented farmers and small-scale entrepreneurs from gaining access to commercial long-&#13;
term credit. A lack of lending skills and suitable long-term funds in Lithuanian banks has also aggravated&#13;
the situation. The project would provide interim measures to overcome these transitional constraints by&#13;
providing intensive institutional and human resource development TA support, in addition to long-term&#13;
credits and permanent working capital. Furthermore, TA for land reform efforts (the completion of&#13;
which would require many years beyond the project life) would expedite registration of land titles, help&#13;
create a mortgage system with more tangible collateral, and allow consolidation of fragmented farmland&#13;
through transactions in a land market. Therefore in addition to enhancing and demonstrating financial&#13;
viability of agricultural investment through technical and financial assistance, the project would reduce&#13;
the reluctance of commercial banks towards agricultural lending by improving collateral, and reducing&#13;
I     Lithuanian Agriculture and Food Sector Review, IBRD #131 1-LT, April 14, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                                                   Chapter 5&#13;
high transaction costs through training of loan officers and improving their risk assessment skills.&#13;
5.5           Economic Benefits. Given the nature of a line of credit operation, it is not possible, nor&#13;
desirable, to foresee the exact subprojects to be financed, therefore, it is not possible to estimate a&#13;
project-wide rate of return. According to the lending guidelines for PFIs, each loan approved would be&#13;
required to demonstrate adequate financial rates of return.&#13;
5.6           In addition to the built-in safeguards of the adequate financial viability which subprojects&#13;
must demonstrate, Lithuania is a low cost producer of most of its major agricultural products and&#13;
consequently agriculture shows good returns on investment. Each individual investment would be&#13;
evaluated for its repayment capacity and cash flows. Crop and livestock budgets have been prepared&#13;
for the most common crop and livestock production systems in Lithuania, under the assumption that&#13;
farmers would have access to credit to finance improved seeds, breeding stock, and other necessary&#13;
inputs, and farm management would improve with the help of extension services under the "with project&#13;
case. " Based on the above assumptions, "with project" per ha. net present values would increase by 10%&#13;
for rapeseed and up to 50% for potatoes. For livestock, net present value per animal would increase by&#13;
25 % for beef cattle and substantially higher, by 300 %, for dairy cows. Large incremental increases for&#13;
dairy cows and breeding sows illustrate that the potential gains are large, particularly for those farms&#13;
which currently have poor production conditions. In addition, integrated farm-models for typical farms&#13;
were developed and illustrate a substantial increase in farmers' income (by around 45% for typical&#13;
farmers and by 40% for large-scale private farmers2).&#13;
5.7           The actual economic benefit of the project would, however, considerably exceed what can&#13;
be quantified because of the systemic nature of the project, covering all aspects of the transformation to&#13;
a market economy, including the development of market institutions and policy reform. The size of this&#13;
overall economic benefit has not been quantified. However, results of the quantitative analysis of sample&#13;
subprojects and qualitative benefits stemming from the potential project, adequately justify additional&#13;
investment in the agricultural sector.&#13;
5.8           Reduction in Subsidies and Controlled Fiscal Impact. The Government, as the Borrower,&#13;
would guarantee the repayment of the investment credit line; and TA cost would be covered by donor-&#13;
financed grants. There are no other direct investments associated with the project. The project would&#13;
provide an opportunity to instill discipline, both in borrowers and financial intermediaries, and hence&#13;
enhance the financial viability of agricultural investment. This in turn, would broaden the tax basis and&#13;
increase revenues. The Government has decided that recapitalization funds for the ABL would be&#13;
diverted from the main source of subsidies, the Agricultural Support Fund, hence reducing direct&#13;
subsidies at the same time. The project would also provide an opportunity to reduce agricultural&#13;
subsidies, hence lessening a fiscal burden on the Central Government's budget.&#13;
5.9           Justified Role of the Government. Based on the current market failure which has caused&#13;
the absence of commercial investment credit to the agricultural sector, and the substantial need to&#13;
restructure both the financial and agricultural sectors, which requires a comprehensive policy reform, the&#13;
involvement of the Government is justified. The Government's involvement provides an opportunity to&#13;
reduce subsidized credit for the sector and commercialize rural financing. In addition, as the major&#13;
shareholder of the ABL, the Government's full commitment to restructuring the ABL and its endorsement&#13;
2      Based on 20 ha farm size for typical farms and 50 ha for large commercial farms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Benefits, Justification, and Risks                                                       35&#13;
of the institutional development program for the ABL, are critical. Furthermore, the GOL's affirmation,&#13;
conveyed in a Statement of Policies, that it would ensure full autonomy of the ABL in its lending&#13;
operation and support transformation of the ABL into a commercial bank, would establish a solid&#13;
foundation for ABL privatization in the future.&#13;
5.10          Strengthening of Local Institutional Capacity. Local institutional capacity varies from one&#13;
institution to another. In general, capacity to implement and supervise the project is in place but needs&#13;
further strengthening. The project would provide substantial technical assistance for all relevant agencies&#13;
including the ABL, agricultural advisory services (extension), local consulting agencies, Land&#13;
Management Department, and agricultural colleges and applied research institutes. Comprehensive bank&#13;
strengthening support through twinning arrangements with major foreign banks would improve key&#13;
banking aspects of PFIs, including loan assessment, repayment and collection, resource mobilization and&#13;
financial planning. Lithuania has also enacted bankruptcy, collateral, and land laws. Although imperfect,&#13;
the legal and regulatory capacity is reasonably in place to foster private activities. The Government&#13;
continues to make efforts to strengthen its supervisory capacity through various technical assistance and&#13;
training activities.&#13;
5.11          Targeted Poverty Alleviation Support.  The proportion of the poor among project&#13;
beneficiaries is significantly larger than the national average. The Sector Review has revealed that the&#13;
average agricultural wage has declined from 97% of the national average in 1990 to less than 50% in&#13;
1994. Poverty is particularly prevalent in rural areas where very few income generating alternatives&#13;
exist.  The proposed project would assist the rural unemployed by helping them  identify new&#13;
opportunities, provide training in new skills for alternative income generating activities and business&#13;
planning, and by matching new business ideas with credit, where viability is demonstrated. They would&#13;
also be eligible to apply for loans under the project for starting new business.&#13;
5.12          Environmental Assessment of Subproiects. The project would enhance development of&#13;
environmentally sound and sustainable agriculture through institutional strengthening. Although the&#13;
project is rated "B" and has limited environmental impact, new lending guidelines for participating banks&#13;
would include an environmental assessment section and loan officers would be trained in environmental&#13;
review. The environmental screening procedures of the proposed project have been fully endorsed by&#13;
the Borrower and participating banks and are considered to be pragmatic approaches which are suitable&#13;
for Lithuania (Chapter 4, Section F).&#13;
C. RISKS&#13;
5.13          Since this is the first agricultural investment project supported by the Bank, MOA's&#13;
understanding of procedures and requirements of Bank financed projects is limited. Consequently, there&#13;
is a risk that project implementation may deviate from the original design and quality of project&#13;
implementation is less than expected. Close and frequent supervision by Bank missions would reduce&#13;
this risk. Another risk is the limited ability and experience of the financial institutions in Lithuania in&#13;
commercial lending, including loan evaluation and risk assessment. These risks will be mitigated by the&#13;
intensive technical assistance to be provided to the PFIs as part of the project. However, agricultural&#13;
production is inherently risky because of the nature of its production and climatic uncertainties. TA for&#13;
improving markets and technical information, as well as TA for improving farm business management,&#13;
would be designed to address these sector-specific risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                                              Chapter S&#13;
5.14         As part of the ongoing efforts of the GOL to move to a market based, private agriculture&#13;
sector, the project obviously carries some risks; chief among them are: (a) recurrent macro-economic&#13;
instability; (b) possible political instability; (c) market and exchange rate fluctuations, particularly for&#13;
those investment subprojects with long gestation period; (d) weakness of the emerging financial sector;&#13;
(e) unfamiliarity on the part of the MOA with project implementation procedures, thus delaying the&#13;
project; and (f) financial risk inherent in new, private farming, i.e. farmers' limited capacity to repay&#13;
credit. The first two are beyond the control of the proposed project. Given a commitment by the&#13;
Government of Lithuania to continue economic reform, as evidenced by the Extended Fund Facility&#13;
(EFF) and the proposed Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL), these risks would be somewhat mitigated.&#13;
The strengthening of financial intermediaries' institutional capacity to assess credit risks and market&#13;
analysis, as well as farm and business management advisory services, would counteract some market and&#13;
financial risks.&#13;
5.15         The Government is only gradually phasing out subsidized credit. There is a risk that it&#13;
would "crowd out" the Bank's credit line and other commercial credit. However, as subsidized credit&#13;
is purely for short-term working capital, and is limited in size and declining and benefitted only a small&#13;
number of beneficiaries, it is not expected to have a major impact on the proposed project. There is also&#13;
a risk that the Government could adopt policies that jeopardize its macro-economic stabilization by&#13;
increasing expenditure or decreasing taxation revenue, which would place upward pressure on the&#13;
inflation rate and jeopardize the functions of the Currency Board. Similarly, in response to rising&#13;
unemployment and the international uncompetitiveness of its exports, the Government could undertake&#13;
a devaluation of the currency or undertake protectionist trade policies that in the long run would hurt the&#13;
transformation of the agriculture sector. This could also jeopardize macro-economic stability. These issues&#13;
are addressed through the EFF criteria set by the Government in negotiation with the International&#13;
Monetary Fund and under the proposed Structural Adjustment Loan.&#13;

3.40);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                                                              Chapter 6&#13;

(TA), and the Borrower would implement any changes necessary to improve the standard&#13;
of TA implementation. The performances of the PMU, APEX, RBC and PFIs would&#13;
likewise be reviewed annually (para. 4.25);&#13;
(p)    The Borrower would comply with the accounting and auditing requirements (para. 4.24)&#13;
and reporting requirements in accordance with Bank guidelines (para. 4.27); and&#13;

condition of loan effectiveness (para. 4.9).&#13;
6.5           Conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Apex Unit on behalf of MOF&#13;
and at least one PFI would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 4.11).&#13;
C. RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.6          With the above agreements and conditions, the proposed Project would be suitable for&#13;
a Bank loan of US $30 million equivalent at the standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 20&#13;
years, including 5 years grace period in US dollars at Bank's standard LIBOR-based variable interest rate.&#13;
The Borrower would be the Republic of Lithuania.&#13;

ANNEX 2: Land Reform and Privatization&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           The current land reform program in Lithuania has its roots in 1989 when it became&#13;
permissible for individual farmers to lease up to 50 ha of agricultural land on favorable terms. In 1991&#13;
a new land reform law was passed the prime objective of which was (a) to restore land and real property&#13;
rights to those who had owned land prior to 1940 and to their heirs; and (b) to privatize land that had&#13;
been held by collective farms. The land laws were further amended in 1993 and 1994 in the light of&#13;
experience with land restitution. A new draft law on land registration is now (1995) in preparation. A&#13;
law on mortgaging land was passed in 1992, but has not yet been implemented. A law governing physical&#13;
planning and development control has been drafted.&#13;
2.            The objective of the land reform program is to reestablish land markets and to put the&#13;
ownership of much of the land in Lithuania into private hands. Eight categories of land and property have&#13;
been recognized:&#13;
--   Public Buildings that will remain in public ownership.&#13;
-   Private buildings in urban and village areas.&#13;
-   Forest land that will remain in public ownership.&#13;
-   Farm and forest land that is subject to restitution or allocation and is mainly in plots of between&#13;
8 and 10 ha.&#13;
-   Land held in leasehold from the state.&#13;
-   Communal land around villages awaiting distribution in 2-3 ha plots.&#13;
--   Allotments owned by garden societies.&#13;
-   Garden plots with summer houses.&#13;
3.           Applications for land restitution or allocation are lodged at the local district or municipal&#13;
office. A preliminary decision on the validity of the application is made by the local subdistrict agrarian&#13;
reform board. If the application is in order, instructions are sent to field surveyors to carry out a&#13;
preliminary survey and mark out the area affected. The documents are then sent to the District Agrarian&#13;
Reform Board for approval. It may take anything from one month to a year before a decision is made.&#13;
If the application is accepted, the district land surveying board will carry out a preliminary registration,&#13;
and will enter the details in the District Office. The applicant must then arrange for a precise geodetic&#13;
survey of the property before a final certificate of ownership can be issued.&#13;
4.            The preliminary recording of title to summer houses with small gardens is expected to&#13;
be completed early in 1996 since estimates indicate that the majority have already been completed. The&#13;
conversion of these preliminary certificates of ownership into fully registered titles also depends on the&#13;
completion of geodetic surveys for which additional payment will be required. Many landowners appear&#13;
unwilling to incur this extra expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                                                                    Annex 2&#13;
Current Status of Land Reform&#13;
5.            Land restitution and privatization have made substantial progress. As of January 1, 1995,&#13;
more than 130,000 private farm holdings have been established and together with about 2,300&#13;
Agricultural Companies, private farm ownership accounted for more than 50 % of the agricultural land&#13;
area. More than 1.2 million preliminary (or provisionary) titles have been issues, of which, about 46,683&#13;
have been registered with final titles. The status of land reform is sununarized below:&#13;

6.            Before the Second World War the average farm size was around 15 ha, with some farms&#13;
being 50 ha or more. The system of inheritance has therefore reduced the typical farm size by about half&#13;
since 1940. Whether the combination of market forces and an efficient land registration system will&#13;
necessarily lead to larger farms is not yet clear, since the formal farm land market is not yet in place.&#13;
Land cannot officially be sold until it has a final certificate of title.&#13;
7.            Approximately 400,000 families are awaiting the allocation of small area (2 to 3 ha) farms&#13;
that are essentially used for subsistence agriculture. Thirty-five thousand or about 8 percent have been&#13;
surveyed and a preliminary certificate of ownership prepared. Many of these personal cultivation areas&#13;
are at present made up of several scattered plots, which would be easier to farm and more efficiently&#13;
utilized for agricultural production if they were consolidated.&#13;
Government Objectives&#13;
8.            The Government of Lithuania wishes to speed up the issue of certificates of title to land,&#13;
to ensure that land dealings can be carried out in a timely way, and to facilitate the smooth and efficient&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                                     43&#13;
operation of a land market. In order to achieve these aims, there must be focus on three areas: legislation,&#13;
management, and technical operations. There are thus three basic objectives.&#13;
9.           The first objective is to improve the legislative framework. Although much work has&#13;
already been undertaken in this regard and much is still in progress, additional technical assistance is still&#13;
needed with regard to the following:&#13;
Basic Land Law&#13;
Law on Land Registration&#13;
Law on Mortgaging&#13;
Law on Land Use Planning and Development Control&#13;
10.          The second objective is to help the National Land Survey become more financially&#13;
independent from central funds by clarifying the true costs of its products and services, identifying market&#13;
opportunities, and developing a strategy for moving toward full cost recovery.&#13;
11.          The third objective is to improve the technical operation of land registration by identifying&#13;
more precisely what data are required and how they may be effectively handled at the local level. The&#13;
emphasis will be on speeding up the handling of applications for first registration and on ensuring that&#13;
subsequent land transfers, including mortgage registration, can be undertaken speedily and efficiently.&#13;
12.          In order to assist the Government in achieving these objectives, TA program is being&#13;
designed to address the following:&#13;
(a) improve the legislation that controls the administration of rights in land and property,&#13;
(b) reduce the dependence of the National Land Survey on central government funds by increasing&#13;
its capacity for cost recovery,&#13;
(c) increase the efficiency with which applications for first registration are dealt with, and ensure that&#13;
the subsequent land market can operate effectively and speedily, and&#13;
(d) develop skills in managing cadastral data, including those derived from orthophotography.&#13;
Institutional Organization of Land Reform&#13;
13.          The administration of the land reform program is now the responsibility of the National&#13;
Land Survey, an agency formed in 1995 from the former State Land Survey Institute, the State Land&#13;
Cadastre Enterprise, and the Land Management Department of the Ministry of Agriculture. The National&#13;
Land Survey is answerable to the Minister of Agriculture. It has three main departments, one for Land&#13;
Management, one for Geodesy and Cartography, and one for the Cadastre. The Cadastre Department is&#13;
concerned with land information systems. The Land Management Department has three divisions dealing&#13;
with land management, land use, and land reform. At the local level, there are district agrarian reform&#13;
boards with subdistrict boards who do the initial processing of applications for land.&#13;
&#13;

14.          Land registration operates through 44 rural offices and 11 city offices where the bulk of&#13;
the processing of applications takes place. The system does not yet constitute a legally guaranteed registry&#13;
of land and property rights, although the basic structure could be adapted to this end.&#13;
15.          The system includes a thorough description and indexing of each parcel. It has the&#13;
capacity to incorporate ownership and other legal rights, including servitudes, and it is recognized by the&#13;
local people who have deposited their land claims there. Further legislation, however, would need to be&#13;
enacted to ensure that the accuracy of the records can be legally guaranteed, which would provide&#13;
security of title.&#13;
16.          The Ministry for Urban Development has prepared a draft law on territorial planning that&#13;
will control land use and land use rights in urban areas and on agricultural land that is just outside the&#13;
designated boundaries of the urban areas. The law has not yet been implemented.&#13;
17.          The Ministry of Justice prepared the law on mortgaging that was passed in 1992, but&#13;
which has not yet been implemented. The law was based on a much earlier law that predated the&#13;
command economy and proved inappropriate for modem financial services. A new law on mortgaging&#13;
is under consideration.&#13;
18.          The Ministry of Finance has been concerned with the development of land and property&#13;
valuation systems to support credit applications. The Ministry of Agriculture has been responsible for&#13;
developing a land registration system that could be used to guarantee credit. The creation of a Hypothec&#13;
Bank is currently under review. Draft legislation governing the valuation of real estate is being prepared&#13;
in collaboration with the Ministry of Justice.&#13;
Legal, Technical, and Management Issues in Implementing Land Reform&#13;
19.          Land reform in Lithuania was previously slowed by inadequacies in the legislative&#13;
framework, a lack of market orientation in the service provided, a lack of equipment (especially&#13;
computers) to process the applications, and burdensome administrative procedures.&#13;
20.          In order to facilitate the rapid launch of the land reform program and to restitute land&#13;
quickly, legislation was hastily brought forward in 1992. There was at the time a general lack of&#13;
experience in dealing with land law-few lawyers, for example, had been trained to deal with land&#13;
matters-and this resulted in defective and incomplete legislation. The land reformn program was seen by&#13;
officials more as an administrative exercise than as a legal framework that would support the operations&#13;
of a land market. As a result, the initial legislative framework was weak.&#13;
21.           This weakness was further aggravated by  a tendency for excessive caution. The&#13;
conversion of user rights and other preliminary certificates of ownership into fully registered titles&#13;
depends at present on the completion of geodetic surveys. These surveys are required as a result of&#13;
administrative edict, not by the Law on Land. Whereas the pursuit of excellence is understandable, this&#13;
requirement is adding significantly to the delays in issuing full title. Furthermore, it has resulted in&#13;
precise measurements being made to "correct" the size of plots that have already been set out, leaving&#13;
slivers of wasteland that are unused and unusable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                                        45&#13;
22.           In addition, there is concern that once a title is issued, it cannot be changed through the&#13;
subsequent imposition of environmental controls. Thus, until new environmental and physical planning&#13;
regulations have been passed, great care must be taken by those in authority to ensure that the land is not&#13;
misused. While this is commendable, it tends to ignore the effects of market forces and the commercial&#13;
incentives for farmers to be more productive. Instead, it reinforces the "top-down" administration and&#13;
the emphasis on conformity with regulations.&#13;
23.           The land under preliminary title cannot be sold or mortgaged until it is accurately&#13;
surveyed means that formal land markets cannot develop, and land cannot move to its optimum use or&#13;
be reflected in its price. There is an inherent danger that informal markets will develop instead, and there&#13;
is some tentative evidence that this may be happening.&#13;
24.           The lack of unit cost data is an example of the producer-driven rather than user-driven&#13;
management techniques that operate within the National Land Survey. At present, the true overhead costs&#13;
of various activities cannot be determined. The fees to be charged for services appear to have been based&#13;
on intuition and judgment of what can be accepted and not upon any analysis of costs. There is an&#13;
understandable lack of business experience in running the organization, but if land registration is to&#13;
operate within a business environment, there must be a clearer understanding of the needs of the market&#13;
place and of the opportunities for full cost recovery.&#13;
25.           The present approach to surveying and mapping by state agencies is neither cost effective&#13;
nor market oriented. While all nations have found that the initial registration of title to land has to be&#13;
subsidized by the state, subsequent dealings can be made dependent on the user paying for the service.&#13;
Furthermore, most surveying and mapping agencies can recover significantly more of their costs from&#13;
the user community than they currently achieve, for example, through map sales and the provision of&#13;
services.&#13;
26.           The two major areas of land reform that have been causing concern are: (a) the restitution&#13;
of the standard sized (8 to 10 ha) private farms; and (b) the small area (2 to 3 ha) farms that are used&#13;
essentially for subsistence agriculture. From an economic perspective, priority in land restitution needs&#13;
to be given to the standard sized farms since registration should help increase agricultural production. A&#13;
secure title to the land together with a facility to use it as collateral should result in greater confidence&#13;
for creditors, increased investment, greater productivity and higher land values.&#13;
27.           There is, however, social pressure to speed up the restitution of the 2-3 ha farms. These&#13;
are used essentially for subsistence agriculture and allow families to become self-sufficient. In their&#13;
present form, they are unlikely to contribute to the improvement of the national economy. So far, some&#13;
35,000 or about 8 percent of these small farms have been surveyed and preliminary titles prepared. Many&#13;
are made up of several scattered plots that would need to be consolidated before they could become&#13;
economically viable. Land consolidation takes time and money and requires diplomacy, since there is a&#13;
need to obtain agreement to the new pattern of land occupation. There must also be agreement to any&#13;
charges or compensation that may be necessary to reconcile those who may be marginally better or worse&#13;
off as a result of the redistribution.&#13;
28.           On the technical side, two initiatives will speed up the process of land restitution. The&#13;
first is to improve office management techniques and procedures, especially in the district and city&#13;
offices, by increasing the computerization of the land records. These aspects are being addressed within&#13;
the PHARE LIS Project. This will also facilitate the workings of the formal land market as and when it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46                                                                              Anne 2&#13;
develops. There needs to be a clearer definition of what information is needed by the users. A proposal&#13;
for a formal study of user needs is under consideration by PHARE in Brussels. Whereas the government&#13;
has traditionally been the major user, much of the data that it has gathered in the past is no longer&#13;
needed, while new forms of data are necessary for the benefit of landowners. Thus, new cadastral plans&#13;
are now required both for indexing land parcels and for providing more detailed information about&#13;
individual plots. Computerization of the text (alpha-numeric) records is the first priority and&#13;
computerization of the cadastral maps will subsequently assist the development of the land information&#13;
system.&#13;
29.          The second initiative, whereby the issue of title could be speeded up, is in the production&#13;
of cadastral surveys. Although significant improvement would result from a more flexible legislative and&#13;
regulatory framework, there could still be avoidable delays. The EU-PHARE project is providing some&#13;
help in training field surveyors and thus expedite the preparation of detailed plot surveys. It is also&#13;
addressing the management and organization of the overall process to help identify and eliminate&#13;
bottlenecks in the methodology and ensure cost effective operation. The use of basic photogrammetric&#13;
techniques could also greatly accelerate the allocation of titles since photogrammetry is a mass-production&#13;
tool capable of achieving major economies of scale provided that reasonable standards of accuracy are&#13;
sought. In this respect, the proposed Swedish project on orthophotography should provide basic index&#13;
maps that would facilitate land allocation and recording.&#13;
Present Support for Land Reform&#13;
30.          This effort is being supported by a variety of international donors including the EU-&#13;
PHARE program, Sweden and the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).&#13;
31.          The European Union (EU-PHARE program) is involved in technical assistance and&#13;
equipment procurement. Reprographic systems (photocopiers) for use in district and city offices have been&#13;
provided. Delivery of some 90 computers with associated modems, printers, plotters and software is&#13;
expected soon and tendering of modern survey equipments is now being undertaken by PHARE in&#13;
Brussels. Delivery of this equipment is expected in the first quarter of 1996. Training programs to&#13;
develop skills in information technology and to improve the national geodetic framework commenced in&#13;
March 1995. Approximately US$2 million of technical assistance will be delivered under this EU-PHARE&#13;
program, and EU-PHARE is considering the appropriateness of extending the work for another year in&#13;
order to further assist the implementation of the Private Agricultural Development Project and strengthen&#13;
the development of a land market.&#13;
32.          The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been supporting the&#13;
Ministry of Justice in drafting a Law on Land. It has also been collaborating with the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture in preparing a law on land registration. The work has been undertaken by a consultant (Mr.&#13;
Williamn Valletta) who has been providing expert advice.&#13;
33.          Denmark has installed some digital mapping equipment that should help with the&#13;
production of cadastral maps, and is providing ongoing training in its use. Advice on land matters has&#13;
been provided by Germany and Ireland, while the United Kingdom has supported the training of land and&#13;
property valuers. The Norwegian Government funded a pilot project to establish geodetic control and&#13;
produce cadastral maps using aerial photography in an area near Vilnius. The French company, IGN,&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

have produced map extracts for cadastral use of an overlapping area using orthophotography as a&#13;
demonstration of their capability.&#13;
34.          Sweden has provided sundry inputs, including hardware, software, and ongoing technical&#13;
assistance for land administration. So far this has been worth about US$1 million. Swedesurvey has been&#13;
developing a land information system for storing and handling land-related data and has prepared the&#13;
outline for a continuation project. Support and training has also been provided for processing cadastral&#13;
survey and digital mapping data. A project to develop orthophotography in Lithuania is also being&#13;
conducted and the preliminary results are very positive.&#13;
35.          Switzerland has funded the supply of modem topographic digital mapping equipment and&#13;
training for the State Institute of Photography and Geodesy with a capital cost of around US $2.5 million.&#13;

ANNEX 3: Summary of 1994 Farm Survey&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.           As part of the preparation activities for the Private Agricultural Development Project&#13;
(PADP), a survey of Lithuanian farms was undertaken during the summer of 1994 with the assistance&#13;
of the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service (LAAS) and the Association of Agricultural Companies.&#13;
The conclusions reached on the basis of the survey results are presented in Section A below. Since the&#13;
survey was undertaken a number of changes have taken place in the agricultural and food sectors as the&#13;
market economy has continued to develop over the last twelve months. These are summarized in Section&#13;
B. A summary of the results obtained from the farm survey is presented in Section C.&#13;
A. Conclusions from the Farm Survey&#13;
2.           The survey confirmed that there were major structural problems in farm product and input&#13;
supply markets. The wholesaling-trading sector was largely nonexistent. Despite the dominance of the&#13;
old state processors, there are major opportunities for farmers and entrepreneurs to form new marketing&#13;
structures, such as auctions, wholesale markets, input supply and commodity trading cooperatives, and&#13;
small-scale processing plants. In so doing, many of the problems registered by farms can be alleviated.&#13;
This area should be a priority for any technical assistance.&#13;
3.           Some ACs were in very poor condition. Their collective-trained managers admitted to&#13;
a lack of appropriate skills and to a poor-quality work force. Technical and financial performance was&#13;
poor, and very little innovation was exhibited in marketing. Other ACs are, however, achieving better&#13;
results, even where traditional cattle and milk enterprises dominate. These ACs are generating large&#13;
cashflow surpluses. The key difference between the two groups seems to be the ability of the&#13;
management. There is a clear need for technical assistance to provide training for managers of ACs.&#13;
4.           A proportion of private farms show strong expansion and innovation characteristics.&#13;
These farmers, however, are mostly from technical backgrounds and lack financial experience and&#13;
business skills. These farms are a strong model for the industry as a whole and should be strongly&#13;
supported by direct training, where appropriate, and by advisory services with the ability to impart simple&#13;
business skills, marketing knowledge, and market information.&#13;
5.           In common with the developed rural economies of Western Europe, a large proportion&#13;
of private farms in Lithuania are operated on a part-time basis with many farm households dependent on&#13;
income from non-farm sources. It will be important that this is taken into account in the provision of&#13;
infrastructure and the delivery of extension services. There is also a clear need for further development&#13;
of non-farm employment opportunities in rural areas.&#13;
6.           The demand for long-term credit is difficult to assess accurately in a survey, but it would&#13;
seem to be a strong, given the correct conditions. There is a major lack of buildings, machinery, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SO                                                                                 Annex 3&#13;
livestock on many private farms, and there is strong interest in processing and marketing developments.&#13;
Even if a small proportion of the investment intentions listed were to be extrapolated to all of Lithuanian&#13;
agriculture, this would suggest that the proposed $25 million to $30 million World Bank credit line should&#13;
be utilized, given the correct business environment.&#13;
7.           Most farms have little investment and bank experience. Widespread publicity and support&#13;
for the business planning and feasibility process is required. Technical assistance to achieve this would&#13;
have a beneficial impact on the success of the rural credit component of the Private Agricultural&#13;
Development Project.&#13;
8.           Almost half the land farmed by in the sample was leased on a short-term (1-5 years)&#13;
basis, often from a number of individuals. The results are short-term farming policies, a reluctance to&#13;
invest in land improvement, and widely dispersed, costly-to-operate units (even the average 3 ha plotter&#13;
had land spread over 0.9 km). Land reform developments should look first at easing land purchase and&#13;
second at the creation of a fixed-term tenancy option, which gives some security and a longer-term view&#13;
for both farmer and landlord.&#13;
B. Recent Developments&#13;
9.           The results of the farm survey were disseminated to interested parties in Lithuania,&#13;
including Ministry of Agriculture departments, the headquarters and regional offices of LAAS, the&#13;
Association of Agricultural Companies, the Institute of Agrarian economics, and the Agrarian Committee&#13;
of the Seimas. The implications of these results were further discussed in a number of working groups&#13;
and strategies for the further development of the market economy in the agricultural and food sectors&#13;
were developed.&#13;
10.          As a result of the lack of market intermediaries, two co-operative societies has been&#13;
established by individual farmers, other co-operative societies and a number of Agricultural Companies&#13;
in order to construct and operate two centers for the trading of agricultural inputs and outputs. One is&#13;
being established in the environs of the capital Vilnius and the other at Kaunas, a major town in the&#13;
center of the most productive agricultural land in Lithuania. It is expected that these markets will auction&#13;
some products whilst others will be traded by independent individuals or companies. It is also envisaged&#13;
that additional storage facilities are to facilitate will be constructed to facilitate trading activities.&#13;
11.          As detailed in Annex 7, as part of the Institutional and Human Resource Development&#13;
Component of the Project, Technical Assistance is to be provided for the development of marketing&#13;
institutions. The technical assistance will aid the establishment of auction and wholesale markets. EU-&#13;
PHARE and Finland have both indicated their willingness to support that Technical Assistance&#13;
programme.&#13;
12.          The lack of substantial change in the total number of Agricultural Companies masks two&#13;
processes that have been taking place since the summer of 1994. There has been a number of liquidations&#13;
of the least viable Agricultural Companies and while a number of others have been split into several&#13;
smaller units. These ongoing processes are leading to the restructuring of the Agricultural Company&#13;
sector and the demise of those that are least viable.&#13;

Lithuania Private Agriculture Development                                              5S&#13;
13.          A proposal for technical assistance to assist the Association of Agricultural Companies&#13;
in the training of its managers has been included in the Institutional and Human Resource Development&#13;
Component of the Project. The objective of the assistance will be to assist Agricultural Companies adjust&#13;
their operations so that they gain long-term viability in a market economy. Such changes are likely to&#13;
include adjustments in their ownership and management structures in addition to the identification of the&#13;
new opportunities that the development of the market economy will bring. Finland has indicated that it&#13;
would wish to support this important technical assistance programme.&#13;
14.          High priority has been placed on the development of alternative sources of employment&#13;
in rural areas. The Agrarian Committee of the Seimas is particularly aware of the need to reduce the&#13;
dependance of the rural population on traditional farm employment. They estimate that whereas currently&#13;
10 persons are employed per 100 hectares of agricultural land in the future the returns from farming are&#13;
only sufficient to justify 2 persons per 100 hectares. In addition, the LAAS has included the development&#13;
of advisory services for agro-tourism into its on-going plans and has advertised for a specialist in this&#13;
area. It is expected that such activities will be particularly important in the East of Lithuanian where the&#13;
conditions are less favorable for agricultural production. A Technical Assistance programme to aid the&#13;
development of alternative employment in rural areas has also been included in the Institutional and&#13;
Human Resource Development component of the PADP. This programme will be supported by the&#13;
Swedish government.&#13;
15.          Since October 1994, the LAAS has been receiving technical assistance support from a&#13;
team financed by EU-PHARE and the United Kingdom's Know-How-Fund. As part of these programmes&#13;
LAAS advisors have been receiving training on farm accountancy and farm business planning. The&#13;
advisors have as a result designed and started to implement appropriate training courses on these subjects&#13;
for farmers.&#13;
16.          Further technical assistance which would assist the LAAS develop the participatory&#13;
extension skills of its staff has been identified and included as a programme in the Institutional and&#13;
Human Resource Development Component of the PADP. In particular the programme is intended to&#13;
facilitate the two-way flow of information through the extension system. The Danish Agricultural&#13;
Advisory Center hopes to be able to provide that support.&#13;
17.          A center for the promotion of rural business is also being established by producer and&#13;
processor organizations. The main objective of this unit will be to support private investment in fann,&#13;
forestry, agro-processing and rural enterprises. As well as providing potential investors with the&#13;
assistance they require to soundly plan their investments, the unit will also play a crucial role in&#13;
promoting and stimulating individuals to actively develop their businesses. The unit will in addition&#13;
support the generation of rural employment and act as a counterpart for the technical assistance to be&#13;
provided by Sweden.&#13;
18.          In order to alleviate the constraints to the development of the land market EU-PHARE&#13;
has been providing technical assistance to the National Land Survey. The development of the Land&#13;
Information System is being undertaken together with the requisite training. The National Land Survey&#13;
is also being equipped with the survey equipment as part of this technical assistance programme. Despite&#13;
this on-going programme, it was determined that further support was required in order to assist the&#13;
development of a land market. Thus, technical assistance will be provided by Sweden to develop: the&#13;
legal framework for the trade in land; the financial independence of the National Land Survey; and to&#13;
improve the technical operation of land registration. These technical assistance will improve the&#13;
&#13;

C. Summary of the Farm Survey&#13;
Sample Selection&#13;
19.          The sample consisted of 300 private farms and 50 Agricultural Companies (ACs).&#13;
Initially it was intended that random sampling techniques would be used to select the 300 private farms.&#13;
However, the absence of a consistent sampling frame precluded this and, consequently, LAAS advisors&#13;
attempted to use quasi-random techniques to select farmers within their regions while trying to ensure that&#13;
at least one third of respondents were not LAAS clients. The heterogeneity of the ACs and the smaller&#13;
sample size resulted in the adoption of a purposeful sampling technique for these farms, the intention&#13;
being to have broad coverage of the geographic, productive, and financial diversity of the ACs.&#13;
20.          The survey cannot therefore be regarded as fully representative of farming in Lithuania.&#13;
Indeed, the sample appears to contain a higher proportion of the larger private farms than in the&#13;
population. The survey does, however, give a strong indication of the structure and trends within&#13;
Lithuanian farming.&#13;
Agricultural Company (AC) Farm Systems&#13;
21.          ACs have certainly undergone major change since formation in 1992, losing roughly a&#13;
fifth of their land and employees (though over 70 percent lease land from private individuals ). However,&#13;
most are still managed by the old collective leadership with little change in management structure other&#13;
than a reduction in the number of specialists. The ownership of ACs is dominated by pensioners (52&#13;
percent of shares) and to a lesser extent workers (38 percent). This has contributed to overstaffing (only&#13;
8.4 hectares per employee), especially in the crop and machinery areas, despite large-scale mechanization.&#13;
22.           Given the correct incentives, there is ample room for technical improvement on ACs.&#13;
In general, ACs have adopted mixed farming systems with equal areas of crops and grass. Barley&#13;
dominates cropping and is largely consumed on-farm, though most ACs also try to grow cash crops (25&#13;
percent grow oilseed rape). Dairy cows and their progeny dominate livestock systems, and pigs are also&#13;
found on most units. However, stocking rates and crop and stock yields are roughly half of Western&#13;
European rates, and the levels of home-grown and purchased concentrate feed consumption are excessive.&#13;
Most ACs rely heavily on traditional enterprises with very few raising off-farm income. The exception&#13;
is machinery services, though this contributes little to total income.&#13;
23.           Some ACs were found to be generating very large cash surpluses. There was not,&#13;
however, a strong correlation between the size of the net cashflow with the farm enterprises pursued&#13;
although those with wheat, pig, sugar beet and unusual (e.g. fur) enterprises tended to have larger&#13;
positive cashflows. Some ACs where traditional cattle and milk enterprises dominate also had large&#13;
positive cashflows. In contrast, other ACs had large negative net trading cashflows. These ACs tended&#13;
to have high fixed costs, especially for repairs and contracting. The key determinant between those ACs&#13;
with positive and negative net trading cashflows would seem to be the managerial ability.&#13;

24.           While, the average AC balance sheet looks strong its debt is not large and is mostly low-&#13;
interest, short-term government credit. However, the large buildings and machinery inventory are&#13;
undoubtedly overvalued, and some debts may not be recoverable.&#13;
Private Farm Systems&#13;
25.           Private fanrs were analyzed as three separate groups:&#13;
(a)     "Eighty-niners" (89ers) are those farms in production since the first privatization in 1989.&#13;
(b)    "Restitution Farms" are those farms of more than 3 hectares that started production after 1989.&#13;
(c)    "Plotters" are farms of less than 3 hectares.&#13;
26.           In addition, these three groups were split into two subgroups that represent Lithuanian&#13;
Advisory Service clients and non-clients.&#13;
27.           Most private farmers, other than 89'ers, have been farming for less than three years.&#13;
Most came from technical backgrounds on collectives or related organizations, and the restitution sample&#13;
included significant numbers of pensioners (13 percent) and women (23 percent). All groups leased a&#13;
substantial proportion of their farmed area on a short-term basis (1-5 years). The vast majority (84&#13;
percent) of farmers with restituted land have obtained title to their land' although the proportion of&#13;
plotters with title is less than 50 percent.&#13;
28.           On average, private farms follow farming policies similar to those of the ACs with a&#13;
mixture of livestock and crops dominated by dairy cows, barley, and grazing pasture. However, overall&#13;
private farms claim yields well above those of ACs. Compared to ACs, private farmers tend to grow&#13;
a greater area of cash crops and tend to sell their beef calves for fattening. The latter is likely to be due&#13;
to a lack of buildings and capital. Some restitution farmers follow less intensive systems because they&#13;
lack experience, or they farm on a part-time basis. While plotters primarily farm on a subsistence basis&#13;
with crops and stock to meet the needs of the household, some are developing intensive vegetable or&#13;
poultry production.&#13;
29.           LAAS clients were found to be the farmers with the largest farms and although this could&#13;
be a result of the sample chosen, it does conform to results from other countries. In addition, it appears&#13;
that LAAS clients grow more cash crops (especially oilseed rape) and use more agro-chemicals, and claim&#13;
to achieve higher yields than non-clients of LAAS. Of course, one can only speculate as to whether it&#13;
is being LAAS clients that results in these farmers' achieving better yields. It could be the case that&#13;
better farmers, who achieve better yields, are also more aware of the need for information and hence&#13;
become LAAS clients.&#13;
' Although information from the National Land Survey would indicate that this is preliminary&#13;
title.&#13;

30.           Private farming tends to be undertaken on a family basis and few have employees. On&#13;
average, private farms also have fewer (family and hired) workers per hectare than ACs. This is despite&#13;
the small size of the private farms and is another reflection of the overstaffing of the ACs. Few farms&#13;
have staffing levels which approach the low staffing levels of Western European farms. Much of the&#13;
work force is part-time. Off-farm jobs, non-farm businesses, and contracting are common sources of&#13;
external income. A third of restitution farms obtain a quarter of farm household income from pensions.&#13;
Nevertheless, around 80 percent of income for most private farms comes from traditional enterprises.&#13;
The plotters, however, raise only 40 percent of household income from their land.&#13;
31.           A relatively high proportion of the private farm crop area receives agro-chemicals, despite&#13;
low yields, though fertilizer application rates are half those of European Union (EU) levels.2 Contract&#13;
machinery services are widely used by the smaller and newer farms. Contractor rates and fuel and repair&#13;
costs per hectare are once again about half those of West European levels. Restitution farmers are most&#13;
active in machinery purchasing to tool up their new units, while the well established 89'ers are most&#13;
active in building improvement.&#13;
32.           Private farm balance sheets look strong. Some fixed assets may be overvalued, but&#13;
liabilities are well covered by current assets and livestock values. The smaller farms tend not to carry&#13;
debt, but rely instead on family loans and private sources.&#13;
Business Environment&#13;
Prices&#13;
33.           Grain prices received by farmers are very low even compared with the border prices.&#13;
Barley at $60 per ton is around $20 less than the border price. However, milk prices are worse; they&#13;
are only approximately two thirds of the Polish prices. Although low by Western European standards,&#13;
the beef price is comparable to the Polish price.3 Only pigs and horses come within striking distance of&#13;
Western European prices. Rye and wheat prices would seem to be dropping while most others are now&#13;
stabilizing. Sugar beets and potatoes were the only bright points in 1993.&#13;
34.           Input costs are increasing, but are generally less than half EU levels with the only&#13;
exception being diesel fuel. Labor is very cheap (the average quoted by ACs is $11 per week). In order&#13;
to overcome the liquidity constraint barter is widely used. This is, however, usually only for small&#13;
quantities of seed, fertilizer, and feed.&#13;
Markets&#13;
35.           The old state processors dominate the markets for most products. ACs are most reliant&#13;
on these outlets, while private farms have been able to exploit a greater range of outlets and niche&#13;
2 It should of course be noted that the application of fertilizer within the European Union is&#13;
artificially inflated by the use of costly agricultural policies which distort the allocation of&#13;
resources both within the European farm sector and internationally.&#13;
3 Both the milk and beef prices, however, are around 25 percent of EU levels.&#13;

opportunities, especially in selling pigs, cattle, milk, and potatoes. Home consumption (household and&#13;
stock feed) is important on all farms. A third of the private farm and over 60 percent of the AC grain&#13;
crop is fed on farm. There are new processor outlets appearing, especially in the meat industry, but the&#13;
wholesaling-merchantry sector is almost nonexistent. Meanwhile local village and town markets and&#13;
direct sales to consumers can only cope with small volumes. Despite the popularity of barter, the volume&#13;
of production exchanged is almost negligible.&#13;
Marketing Problems&#13;
36.          Poor prices and delays in payment from monopolistic buyers are the major problems for&#13;
almost all farmers. New farms also lack the storage buildings and transport, which are essential tools&#13;
in a market with limited outlets. Quality of product and packaging would seem to be greater problems&#13;
for ACs than for private farms.&#13;
Physical Problems&#13;
37.           Marketing problems are listed as the biggest physical constraint, including a lack of good&#13;
financial and marketing advice. Private farms have a major lack of building capacity and either a lack&#13;
of machinery or problems with the cost of machinery operation due to unreliability and unsuitability.&#13;
Many new farms have no buildings and little machinery.&#13;
38.          ACs, however, list problems which partly relate to an inability to cope with scale.&#13;
Machinery is a problem, but the poor quality of the work force, poor crop and stock performance and&#13;
inappropriate skills and knowledge are also problems. AC managers feel they are lacking in all the most&#13;
important aspects of their job.&#13;
Financial Problems&#13;
39.           Financial problems basically mirrored the problems highlighted earlier: selling prices,&#13;
input prices, and getting paid. Short-term credit is not a problem (the Government has supplied it at&#13;
subsidized rates), but the lack of long-term credit is a problem for two thirds of 89'ers, a third of&#13;
restitution farmers, and half the ACs. Most plotters are not interested in long-term debt.&#13;
Farm Development Opportunities&#13;
40.           The view of opportunities is much broader than that of problems. Private farms look to&#13;
expansion in yields, area, and new crops or livestock. ACs have a much different view looking toward&#13;
more efficient use of inputs and, in two thirds of cases, to new processing and marketing enterprises.&#13;
While this matches their marketing problems, it will require both investment and management training.&#13;
It should be noted that despite their small scale, half the 89'ers and a third of restitution farmers are also&#13;
interested in processing and marketing enterprises.&#13;

56                                                                                 Annex 3&#13;
41.           The private farm and AC survey highlighted investment intentions within the sample,&#13;
given suitable conditions, of LTL 83,870,950 ($20,967,737). This is a very substantial sum, but caution&#13;
must be applied in its interpretation. Despite the fact precise instructions were given to the AC managers&#13;
and LAAS advisors undertaking the survey, farmers may have listed investments that they are unlikely&#13;
to undertake, first to show they do not lack ideas, second to collectively ensure that proposed World Bank&#13;
assistance is not discouraged, and third because they simply have not thought through the feasibility of&#13;
their proposals.&#13;
42.           Investment intentions roughly match problems with private farms wishing to acquire&#13;
buildings (including houses), machinery, and land. Processing ideas are few, but would account for large&#13;
sums of money. The ACs mainly wish to invest in equipment and existing enterprises. However, 27&#13;
percent would like to invest in processing or non-farm developments, including four large meat&#13;
processing enterprises.&#13;
43.           In relation to farm size, the average investment planned by ACs, at LTL 862,000, is&#13;
small compared with that planned by private farms (LTL 146,030).&#13;
Source of Investment Funds&#13;
44.          The majority of farmers would prefer to use their own cash reserves, closely followed&#13;
by long-term commercial loans. However, some ACs noted that private investors were a potential source&#13;
of investment funds.&#13;
Previous Borrowing Experience&#13;
45.           A large proportion (60 percent) of commercial farmers have borrowed in the past, but&#13;
this was mostly government credit. The private farmers with larger well-established farms are willing&#13;
to put up land and houses as collateral, and family guarantors could be found in over 50 percent of cases.&#13;
Infrastructure and Support&#13;
Financial Experience&#13;
46.           Private farms usually have a bank account (but it is not easy to use because of the distance&#13;
to the bank), and around half keep rudimentary financial records, but few have ever prepared a cash flow&#13;
statement. The sample on which this survey was based, probably, consists of individuals who are much&#13;
more financially aware than the average farmer.&#13;
47.           The managers of ACs keep full financial records. Twenty-nine percent have received&#13;
business plan training, but few have used it. Seventeen percent have made a commercial loan application.&#13;
Availability and Use of Support Services&#13;
48.          Most services are available in some form, though specialist advisers and the wholesale-&#13;
trading-input supply complex are deficient. Only 18 percent of private farms were members of&#13;
cooperatives.&#13;

Investment Support&#13;
49.          The technical support required by each type of farm matched what the farmers saw as&#13;
their problems and investment opportunities. The greatest need overall, however, is in the preparation&#13;
of business plans. Private farms would prefer this support in the form of advisory visits and written&#13;
material, while ACs prefer training courses after which they could prepare their own plans.&#13;

local accounting regulations. Based on these rules the Agricultural Bank reported a risk weighted&#13;
capital of 12.8% as of December 31, 1994. Provisions for loan losses, calculated under the local&#13;

LITHUANIA&#13;
Private Agriculture Development Project&#13;
ANNEX 5: Institutional Development Program for the Agricultural Bank of Lithuania&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.           Before the Agricultural Bank of Lithuania (ABL) can function as a financial intermediary&#13;
for onlending of World Bank Private Agriculture Development Project funds to individual farmers,&#13;
agricultural companies, agro-processing, agro-services and other rural enterprises, a major institutional&#13;
strengthening needs to take place. Subloans, made under the World Bank project would finance both&#13;
investments and incremental working capital and repayment terms would be short, medium or long-term,&#13;
depending on the purpose of the loan, the projected cashflow and borrowers' repayment capacity.&#13;
2.           The main focus of the technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the consultants would&#13;
be directed towards the operation of ABL; however, all the outputs produced by the consultants&#13;
(operational guidelines, procedures, loan application and other formats, training material, etc.) would be&#13;
made available to other financial institutions (PFI) participating in project implementation. These PFIs'&#13;
agricultural credit officers and other senior staff (including branch managers) would be invited and&#13;
encouraged to participate in training courses, seminars, and similar activities that will be conducted by&#13;
the consultants.&#13;
3.           With the ABL management's firm commitment to engage in a financial restructuring and&#13;
a comprehensive institutional development program, the Institutional Development Program for the ABL&#13;
has two parts: (a) to improve rural credit operations; and (b) to strengthen the ABL's institutional&#13;
capacity in principal banking areas. The IDP is planned to be implemented over two years; EU-PHARE&#13;
would manage the contracting and selection of a twinning partner, the actual work on part (a) has already&#13;
started and part (b) is scheduled to begin early 1996 and completed in two years. At completion of the&#13;
first two year program, if additional TA is necessary, additional donor financing would be sought at that&#13;
time.&#13;
(a)    Rural Credit Operation would introduce improved rural credit lending guidelines and procedures,&#13;
prepare new lending manuals and train loan officers. This work has already begun and the first&#13;
set of activities is expected to be completed by early Spring 1996. It is expected that the new&#13;
lending guidelines would be applied to the entire ABL lending and not restricted to the Bank&#13;
credit line.&#13;
(b)    Comprehensive Institutional Development Program includes twelve key banking areas to be&#13;
supported as folloWs:&#13;
*     Planning, Budgeting and Performance&#13;
*     Measurement Process&#13;
*     Organizational Restructuring&#13;
*     Human Resource Management&#13;
*     Marketing&#13;
*     Credit Management&#13;
&#13;

*     Branch Management&#13;
*     Asset and Liability Management&#13;
*     Accounting&#13;
*     Management Information System&#13;
*     Information Technology&#13;
*     Internal Audit&#13;
4.           In order to assess progress of the IDP, a set of indicators for each key area of IDP has&#13;
been developed and would be monitored closely during implementation. The indicators are categorized&#13;
as: (a) financial indicators; (b) government indicators; (c) management indicators; and (d) process&#13;
indicators.&#13;
5.           Although the technical assistance to be provided by the consultants under Para. 3 (a)&#13;
above is closely linked to the project, it is intended that the revised and improved lending and loan&#13;
servicing procedures would not remain project specific only and that ABL would apply the improved&#13;
procedures for all its lending operations.&#13;
6.           It is envisaged that lending operations under the project would start in a limited number&#13;
of branches that will be selected by ABL management, in conjunction with the consultants, and be staffed&#13;
by loan officers and their supervisors, who have already participated in the initial training activities and&#13;
have become sufficiently familiar with the revised lending guidelines and operating procedures introduced&#13;
by ABL upon recommendation of the consultants. These branches would serve as pilot branches to test&#13;
the new procedures, provide feedback on credit demand, borrowers' opinion on lending terms and&#13;
conditions, as well as on loan application and other information requirements, etc. After fine-tuning, and,&#13;
if necessary, modifying the operating procedures, and after training of additional loan officers and their&#13;
supervisors, and training of trainers, ABL management will increase the number of branches that will&#13;
participate in lending operations financed under the project.&#13;

ANNEX 6: Rural Business Development Component (RBC)&#13;
The Need&#13;
1.            The changing economic environment in Lithuania has resulted in significant changes in&#13;
rural employment structures. As larger agricultural entities privatize and increase their efficiency, excess&#13;
labor has been forced to seek new employment. Similarly, the emerging private farming system has&#13;
resulted in smaller family farms, which in some cases are too small to generate sufficient revenue to meet&#13;
family expenses. Yet there are very few alternative sources of employment in rural areas. In a more&#13;
mature economy, some of this growing rural un- and under-employment would be absorbed by emerging&#13;
entrepreneurial business opportunities in providing agricultural services and product processing to the&#13;
remaining, more efficient, agricultural producers. Other small business opportunities to take advantage&#13;
of rural craft-making abilities, and other skills in the rural population would also arise. Yet this is not&#13;
happening in Lithuania because the expertise, support systems, and business development services are not&#13;
yet in place to nurture this process.&#13;
2.            Experience shows that agencies providing business support can have great success in&#13;
fostering indigenous enterprise and nurturing new businesses through the critical first few years. The&#13;
skills required in such agencies extend far beyond the standard business consulting functions. First, such&#13;
agencies must adopt a pro-active approach - if they do not, potential business opportunities are lost either&#13;
through the inability of untrained individuals to express them clearly, or through the fear that they will&#13;
not be taken seriously. Second, the agencies must have a sound ability to recognize potentially viable&#13;
projects based upon incomplete information or conversely, to screen out business ideas that have little&#13;
or no chance of success. Staff seconded from successful businesses are crucial in order to fulfill this role.&#13;
Third, the agency must act as a facilitator, drawing together individuals with the appropriate skills to&#13;
support the development of specific business proposals. Such individuals may include those with the&#13;
skills required to judge market potential and technical feasibility, as well as those that can assist&#13;
businesses in undertaking financial analyses and preparing marketing strategies. Since different business&#13;
proposals would require different expertise, rarely would such an agency maintain all the skills in-house.&#13;
Extensive contacts are therefore vital to the operation of the agency.&#13;
3.            Because there are no organized structures in place to link up excess rural labor with&#13;
potential rural business opportunities, an attempt was made to identify possible information and assistance&#13;
sources for rural entrepreneurs and private farmers in the forn of a survey of Lithuanian agricultural and&#13;
business consulting companies and services. The survey identified the following entities with the potential&#13;
to eventually assist private farmers and rural entrepreneurs; the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service&#13;
(LAAS), the Innovation Center at the Lithuanian Agricultural Academy, 15 small companies, several&#13;
large international consulting companies, and the European Union (EU)- supported Business Centers.&#13;
A thorough analysis of the services provided by these organizations revealed that major gaps exist in the&#13;
provision of consulting services to private farmers, small-scale agricultural service and supply&#13;
organizations, and agro-processors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78                                                                                    Annae 6&#13;
4.            While the LAAS is rapidly developing its capability in farm record keeping, financial&#13;
analysis, and feasibility study preparation, the advisors still suffer from having little or no experience in&#13;
business development (especially in food processing), and an almost total unawareness of the importance&#13;
of marketing. The academic staff of the Innovation Center are technically trained and have little business&#13;
experience, particularly in dealing with the needs of small rural entrepreneurs. In addition, the future role&#13;
of the Innovation Center under its new management is unclear. The 15 small consulting companies have&#13;
indicated that they have little or no specific interest or experience in agriculture or the food industry, and&#13;
the limit of US $250,000 on the size of loans to a single sub-borrower (a condition of the Private&#13;
Agriculture Development Project) makes their involvement in potential subprojects to be financed from&#13;
the line of credit unattractive. The larger international consulting companies remain uninterested for the&#13;
same reason. The EU Business Centers have identified their priority areas as being non-farm trade and&#13;
commerce, and they lack agricultural and food business infornation or experience.&#13;
The Rationale for a Rural Business Development Center&#13;
5.            The Rural Business Development Center (RBC) was conceived as a key link in developing&#13;
rural entrepreneurship, orienting the existing private business consulting sector towards rural business&#13;
consulting, and identifying business opportunities for the un- and under-employed rural population. The&#13;
RBC is envisioned as a catalyst in directing existing private structures, and the creation of new private&#13;
enterprises, to absorb excess rural labor, while at the same time directing that labor into providing&#13;
services needed by the rural population. The RBC would not supplant or compete with existing public&#13;
or private structures addressing rural employment opportunities, but rather complement these existing&#13;
efforts by serving as conduit to existing services so that they can better fulfill their mandates. As a nexus&#13;
for rural business development, the RBC would closely interact with public and private entities in the&#13;
following manner:&#13;
6.            Creation and Evaluation of Coherent Business Plans and Feasibility Studies. As the&#13;
Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) of the PADP would bear full lending risks of any loans they&#13;
make, they can lend only on the basis of strict commercial criteria. Foremost among these criteria is the&#13;
expected ability of proposed investment to generate sufficient revenue for entrepreneurs to meet interest&#13;
and repayment obligations. But in order to convince the PFI loan officers and/or commnittees that&#13;
proposed investments meet these criteria, entrepreneurs would need to demonstrate that their proposals&#13;
are well conceived and based on technical feasibility, sound procurement practices, and fill a market need&#13;
in the supply of goods or services demanded by consumers. The RBC would help potential borrowers&#13;
articulate and create business plans which could meet PFI lending criteria.&#13;
7.            Identification of Additional Business Development Resources. Once a potential business&#13;
opportunity has been identified and adequate business planning and feasibility of implementation has been&#13;
assured, the RBC would assist the client in identifying public and private resources which could help the&#13;
client develop market strategies (information and research, product or service positioning) and is familiar&#13;
with the client's local market. The RBC would maintain a list of "RBC approved" business development&#13;
consulting firns which can help RBC clients at this stage. More sophisticated rural entrepreneurs or&#13;
those with adequate financial resources could also use the RBC's referral service to find private sector&#13;
assistance in maximizing their businesses' potential.&#13;
8.            Strengthening of Local Consulting Companies. The existing consulting companies in&#13;
Lithuania (about 15) are at present working primarily with the large restructuring projects linked to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                                     79&#13;
former state enterprises; they have limited experience in dealing with small agro-industrial projects. In&#13;
addition, according to the aforementioned survey, their interest in handling relatively small projects is&#13;
low, because of the relatively small fees for these types of projects. During the early years of the project&#13;
implementation and until local consulting companies are better trained, the RBC would provide consulting&#13;
services directly to the project beneficiaries (clients). In addition the RBC would prequalify local&#13;
consulting companies according to criteria to be established by its governing body. It would train a&#13;
number of preselected consulting companies in the preparation of business plans, feasibility studies, and&#13;
market surveys; and would encourage these companies to get involved in small investment projects.&#13;
Participatory training materials are being developed, and the first training course for potential&#13;
entrepreneurs has already taken place in spring 1995. In addition, technical assistance programs would&#13;
be undertaken to train managers of ACs, as well as other entrepreneurs, in methods to evaluate the&#13;
strengths and weaknesses of their businesses and in the skills to implement required changes and in the&#13;
management of investments financed under the project. The RBC would also have a clearinghouse role&#13;
as a resource reference center for information on marketing, technology, pricing data, foreign contacts,&#13;
links to other consulting groups, and public assistance for small businesses.&#13;
9.           Rural Employment Generation Component.  The Swedish TA program  for rural&#13;
employment generation would use the RBC as a conduit in helping determine the pilot district (out of ten&#13;
districts in Lithuania) for intensive entrepreneurial guidance, and the RBC would assist participants in the&#13;
pilot program with business plans and feasibility studies.&#13;
10.          Identification of Potential Rural EmDloyment or Business Opportunities Based on Local&#13;
Needs. Based on its interaction with public and private organizations concerned with rural employment&#13;
and rural entrepreneurs, the RBC would be in a unique position to identify areas in which certain services&#13;
and products are lacking - by locality and by sector. RBC could then help match existing needs in certain&#13;
localities with entrepreneurs willing to satisfy those needs.&#13;
RBC Organization and Structure&#13;
11.          While organized as a joint-stock company, the RBC would operate as a non-governmental&#13;
organization. Ownership would be in the form of share subscription. In order to ensure the accountability&#13;
of the RBC and that its services meet the needs of its clientele, the RBC would be partially owned&#13;
(roughly 20%) by the producer organizations such as the Association of Agricultural Companies, the&#13;
Farmer's Union, and milk, meat, and feed associations. The RBC operating strategy would be set by&#13;
a board of directors that would represent the ownership of the organization and the clientele. The Chief&#13;
Executive Officer (CEO) of the RBC would be responsible to the Board for the day-to-day operations of&#13;
the unit. The RBC would not be a large costly organization but rather a flexible dynamic team that could&#13;
respond to the changing needs of its client base. Consequently the RBC would initially have a small staff&#13;
of approximately five Lithuanian professionals and a maximum of two office juniors as support staff.&#13;
12.          The development of the business advisory role of the RBC would be assisted by foreign&#13;
consultants provided under donor grant-financed technical assistance. The technical assistance shall assist&#13;
the RBC develop its operational procedures and techniques; perform on the job staff training and training&#13;
by example; and assist the CEO in developing appropriate management systems.&#13;
13.          Operational Modalities. The RBC would charge private investors for its services.&#13;
However, full cost recovery during the first and second year of operation is unlikely, since the RBC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80                                                                            Annex 6&#13;
would also undertake nonrevenue-generating public good activities. Therefore, the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture has agreed to use counterpart funds from the EU-PHARE grain sales to cover the gap in&#13;
operational expenditures.&#13;

ANNEX 7: Summary of TA for Institutional and Human Resources Development Component&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Detailed Terms of Reference for these technical assistance programs are available in the Project files.&#13;
Brief summaries of the programs are presented below.&#13;
Land Reform&#13;
1.           The Government of Lithuania is committed to the process of land reform initiated in 1991&#13;
the objectives of which are to restitute the ownership of land to those who owned it (or their heirs) prior&#13;
to 1940 and to privatize the land that had been farned by the state and collective farms.' However,&#13;
progress on land reform has been hampered by Lithuanian legislators' inexperience of land law and a lack&#13;
of equipment. Bilateral and multilateral aid is helping the Lithuanian National Land Survey to overcome&#13;
these problems. However, the development of a land market in Lithuania is still constrained by the&#13;
legislative framework, the lack of appropriate administrative procedures and experience (particularly in&#13;
risk management and cost recovery) and the need for the further development of a single land registration&#13;
system that contains all the data required to legally guarantee land transactions. The following Technical&#13;
Assistance Programs shall therefore be undertaken.&#13;
(a)    Legislative and Administrative Development: To foster the development of a land market in&#13;
Lithuania by the provision of specialist assistance for the further development of applicable&#13;
legislation and administration systems, increasing the efficiency of the system, the development&#13;
of skills in the management of cadastral data and increasing the capacity for cost recovery.&#13;
(b)    Land Information System: To continue the on-going development work on the land information&#13;
system required to legally guarantee land transactions&#13;
Extension System Development&#13;
2.           In response to the changing structure of the agricultural sector resulting from privatization&#13;
and the move to a market economy there has been a need to transform and improve the advice given to&#13;
farmers. The Ministry of Agriculture together with the Farmers Union and the Association of Agricultural&#13;
Companies jointly established the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service (LAAS) to meet this&#13;
challenge. LAAS has been receiving technical assistance from multilateral (PHARE) and bilateral donors&#13;
(notably the British Know-How-Fund and Denmark amongst others) which previously included much of&#13;
the physical infrastructure required to equip LAAS and is now providing staff training in extension&#13;
methodology and techniques. This has allowed the service to rapidly develop its activities. However, the&#13;
extension service is just one component of the extension system which includes the research and&#13;
educational organizations as well as the Ministry of Agriculture itself. A principal role of these&#13;
I     Certain of the state farms will be maintained in public ownership for research purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82                                                                                 Annex 7&#13;
organizations is to pass to the extension service relevant information for dissemination to farmers. In&#13;
order that the information is relevant these organizations need to respond to farmers' needs. The&#13;
following technical assistance programs shall be undertaken to assist them achieve this.&#13;
E-01 The Further Development of the Census of Fann Businesses: To reduce the cost of&#13;
undertaking the Institute of Statistics' census of farm businesses so that it may be&#13;
undertaken on an annual basis.&#13;
E-02 The Development of a Survey of Private Farm Accounts: To implement a survey of&#13;
farm accounts that is broadly compatible with similar surveys used in market based&#13;
economnies.&#13;
E-03 Survey of Farmer Opinion. To provide information on the opinions and perceptions&#13;
of farmers and thereby aid the monitoring and evaluation of the Private Agricultural&#13;
Development Project.&#13;
E-04 Ministry of Agriculture Management Training: To facilitate the adaptation of the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and related institutions to their new role of fostering a&#13;
competitive market based economy.&#13;
E-5O Flexible Extension System Development: To further the development of the whole&#13;
extension system by facilitating the two-way flow of information through the system so&#13;
that it meets the need of farmers.&#13;
Marketing&#13;
3.           The development of domestic and export markets for the output of the Lithuanian&#13;
agricultural and food sectors is especially constrained by two factors. First, primary agricultural producers&#13;
(farmers and Agricultural Companies) face great difficulties in finding markets for their products. There&#13;
are a variety of reasons for this including oligopolistic agro-processing industries and the lack of&#13;
agricultural and food distribution systems based upon market institutions. Second, that executives in&#13;
agricultural and food processing companies have little experience of the need to adjust production&#13;
activities so that the output produced meets the needs and wants of consumers while achieving the&#13;
objectives of the firms. The latter constraint is one of the reasons for the large imports to Lithuania of&#13;
processed food products (although until recently this was also encouraged by the policies that limited the&#13;
size of the mark-up on domestically produced food products) and the poor export performance of&#13;
processed food producers. In order to alleviate these constraints and improve the export performance of&#13;
the industry, the following technical assistance programs have been identified.&#13;
M-01 Farm Level Marketing-The Development of Marketing Institutions: To assist the&#13;
creation of a decentralized market economy through the development of Lithuanian&#13;
experience in the establishment and operation of agricultural market institutions.&#13;
M-02 Agricultural Market Education: To assist participants in the agricultural markets&#13;
develop their experience of the determinants of market prices including the effects of&#13;
product quality and location, and the causes of price movements in the short, medium and&#13;
longer terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                                        83&#13;
M-03 Food Marketing Training Courses: To improve the marketing abilities of those&#13;
involved in the production and sale of processed agricultural products.&#13;
Export Development&#13;
M-04 Trade Information Development: To assist the Agricultural Trade Agency, to be&#13;
established by the Ministry of Agriculture, create a service for the collection, processing,&#13;
storage and dissemination of trade data.&#13;
M-05 Product Workshops: To improve the export performance of the agricultural, food&#13;
and fishery sectors of the Lithuanian economy.&#13;
M-06 Export Promotion: To assist the development of Lithuanian skills in the production&#13;
of export promotional material and the undertaking of an international trade mission.&#13;
Business Skill Development&#13;
4.            The success of the credit component of the Private Agricultural Development Project&#13;
crucially depends upon: the ability of entrepreneurs to develop commercially sound subprojects that are&#13;
capable of generating sufficient income to meet the interest payment and capital repayments due; and the&#13;
ability of loan officers to realistically evaluate the likelihood of subprojects meeting this requirement while&#13;
sufficiently rewarding the entrepreneur for the risk borne. The process of business planning and the study&#13;
of the feasibility of investments is an important tool which assists entrepreneurs to carefully consider,&#13;
develop and refine their subprojects. Entrepreneurs should therefore be actively involved in the&#13;
business/investment planning process. This process also results in a document which is likely to be&#13;
required by potential lenders to assist them evaluate the likelihood of subproject success. Therefore,&#13;
technical assistance programs shall be undertaken to both encourage the provision of sound consultancy&#13;
and business planning services for the agricultural and food sectors and to encourage entrepreneurs to be&#13;
actively involved in the study of investment feasibility by providing the skills they require. In particular&#13;
the following technical assistance programs shall be undertaken:&#13;
BS-O1 Training Private Farmers in Understanding and Judging Feasibility: To assist&#13;
Lithuanian institutions develop and deliver training courses for private farmers on the&#13;
concept and techniques required to develop feasible investment projects.&#13;
BS-02 Agricultural Company Management Training: To strengthen and develop the&#13;
managerial capacity of the Agricultural Companies and thereby aid the process of their&#13;
transformation.&#13;
Rural Employment&#13;
5.            The development of the efficiency and competitiveness of the agricultural and food sectors&#13;
of Lithuania will inevitably result in increased visible unemployment as companies shed labor in order&#13;
to reduce costs and raise productivity. The process of land reform will also result in the creation of many&#13;
farms which are too small to generate sufficient income to meet the farm families' needs. Such trends&#13;

the development of alternative full- and part-time employment opportunities. The stimulus for these&#13;
developments should come from the rural populations since their involvement will increase the local&#13;
ownership of the subprojects and ensure that they meet local needs. The following Technical Assistance&#13;
program shall therefore be undertaken.&#13;
RE-01 Assistance for Rural Employment Generation: To stimulate the development of&#13;
alternative rural employment opportunities by raising the awareness of the rural&#13;
population to alternative opportunities, assisting the development of demonstration&#13;
community based projects (particularly those undertaken by females), and providing&#13;
training specifically directed towards the needs of female farmers.&#13;
BS-03 The Establishment of a Rural Business Development Center: To support the&#13;
development of sound investment projects and the development of alternative employment&#13;
opportunities in rural areas by promoting excellence in the provision of rural business&#13;
advisory services.&#13;
Rural Credit Systems&#13;
6.           A major component of the project is the line of credit for private farmers, Agricultural&#13;
Companies, agricultural service and supply companies, agro-processors, and rural enterprises. While&#13;
several private commercial banks have expressed interest in participating in the Project and those that are&#13;
eligible and are willing to enter into subsidiary loan agreements with the Ministry of Finance/Bank of&#13;
Lithuania will be invited at act as PFIs these banks are unlikely to lend to smaller farm or rural enterprise&#13;
based subprojects. This is due both to their lack of experience of lending to agriculture and their limited&#13;
branch networks. Conversely, the Agricultural Bank of Lithuania (ABL) which has both experience of&#13;
lending to Lithuanian agriculture (although mainly on noncommercial terms) and has an extensive branch&#13;
network is ineligible to participate as a financial intermediary under the project. The Government is,&#13;
however, committed to repairing the capital structure of the bank through the removal of bad loans from&#13;
the portfolio of ABL and/or subscribing to new share capital. The management of ABL has also&#13;
indicated its firm commitment to reforming its lending procedures and policies. Consequently the&#13;
following two Technical Assistance programs shall be undertaken.&#13;
Rural Banking: To prepare a Rural Credit Manual for all PFIs.&#13;
Institutional Development Program for ABL: To improve the operational structure and&#13;
policies of ABL so as to be an eligible PFI under the PADP. The development of twelve&#13;
key banking areas will be supported: Planning, Budgeting and Performance;&#13;
Measurement Process; Organizational Restructuring; Human Resource Management;&#13;
marketing; Credit Management; Branch Management; Asset and Liability Management;&#13;
Accounting; Management Information Systems; Information Technology; and Internal&#13;
Audit.&#13;

SUPERVISION&#13;
7.           The Institutional and Human Resource Development technical assistance shall be&#13;
undertaken by bilateral and multilateral donor agencies under parallel cofinancing arrangements. The&#13;
hiring of consultants, procurement and disbursement shall be undertaken by the donor agencies following&#13;
their own procedures and regulations. If requested by a donor, Bank staff shall participate in the review&#13;
of bids by consultants. In accordance with parallel cofinancing agreements Bank staff shall supervise the&#13;
technical assistance under the Project. Parallel cofinancers will be invited to participate in joint&#13;
supervision missions. Supervision missions will review the monitoring sources collected by the Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) and evaluate the efficacy of the technical assistance. Where the provision of&#13;
technical assistance falls below acceptable standards the Bank staff shall coordinate efforts with the&#13;
borrower and the donor to rectify the situation at the earliest opportunity.&#13;

LITHUANIA&#13;
Private Agriculture Development Project&#13;
ANNEX 8: Environmental Analysis&#13;
1.           Overall, agriculture is an area where environmental improvements are and can be made&#13;
with success and at relatively low costs. The break-up of large farms, and redistribution of land will&#13;
increase the care and concern for land, and will end the monoculture and its reliance on intensive use of&#13;
agro-chemicals. The increasing interest in agro-tourism also enhances the attention for environmentally&#13;
acceptable agricultural practices.&#13;
2.           The proposed operation is expected to have positive environmental effects through the&#13;
promotion of improved land use practices, farming methods and agricultural product processing. The&#13;
proposed project has been reviewed consistent with the requirements of the Lithuanian environmental&#13;
assessment procedures (as explained in the Environmental Aspects annex of Lithuania Power&#13;
Rehabilitation Project) and the provisions of Operational Directive 4.01 'Environmental Assessment', and&#13;
placed in environmental screening category "B".&#13;
3.           Developments in agriculture. The detrimental effects of the previous command economy&#13;
are widely known, and not much different from that in other parts of the region. However, despite major&#13;
efforts in drainage and intensification of agriculture, most of the landscape, with smaller woodlots and&#13;
ponds, was left intact thereby enhancing water management. The present contraction of the agricultural&#13;
sector has actually helped to reduced environmental problems associated with intensive agriculture. The&#13;
amount of fallow land has increased (to an estimated 200,000 HA) thereby decreasing the risk of erosion&#13;
and the need for pesticides.&#13;
4.           Pesticide use has declined from 4 Kg/HA in 1989 to less than 1 Kg/HA in 1994, as most&#13;
are beyond the purchasing power of cash strapped farmers. At present mainly the richer AC's use&#13;
pesticides; most private farmers have replaced the use of herbicides with manual weeding for example.&#13;
Main crops on which pesticides are used include rape, sugarbeets and flax. Most of the previous&#13;
government incentives for pesticide use (subsidized pricing) have been terminated, except for a few&#13;
rayons where local governments have implemented small schemes to promote pesticide use. Although the&#13;
use of agricultural inputs is expected to rise, private farming, market economy, and better&#13;
extension/information are expected to lead to a more judicious use than under the command economy.&#13;
5.           Recent developments. Since 1993 the Government of Lithuania has taken measures to&#13;
strengthen environmental management practice in all sectors, including agriculture. In 1994 it upgraded&#13;
the Environmental Protection Department to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and is in the&#13;
process of preparing a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), which includes, with support by EU-&#13;
PHARE, the preparation of a new environmental law. It has also co-sponsored regional conferences on&#13;
environmental issues in agricultures in countries in economic transition (with OECD) and management&#13;
of agricultural run-off (with USEPA/World Bank). The government has developed its own laws and&#13;
regulations concerning sustainable agricultural practices, including new guidelines on the use of pesticides&#13;
by the Plant Protection Agency. Lithuania has also undertaken cooperative programs with Denmark for&#13;
the management of obsolete agricultural chemicals and pesticides, Sweden in the management of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
88                                                                                  Annex 8&#13;
agricultural run-off, and the USEPA in the management of polder agriculture. It has also initiated (with&#13;
support of USEPA) a program of management of the environmentally vulnerable northern Karst zone,&#13;
where both soil erosion and groundwater contamination are a major concern, leading the Government&#13;
to recommend a limitation of agricultural activities in an area of 160,000 HA.&#13;
6.           In order to respond to the increasing need for environmentally sustainable agricultural&#13;
practices the Ministry of Agriculture has recently established a Committee for Environmental Issues.&#13;
Among the first topics to be addressed is a comprehensive review of the implementation of the removal&#13;
and destruction of obsolete pesticides (with the assistance of Denmark), and further review of the present&#13;
list of approved pesticides. In this effort it is following international standards including use of the WHO&#13;
classification.&#13;
7.            The Ministry of Agriculture continues its support for farmer training and requires&#13;
certification of pesticide users, but this program is increasingly hampered by the high cost, of protective&#13;
clothing, and the lack of training material. Training is provided through either/or LAAS, Plant&#13;
Protection, local Agricultural Schools. This year the Plant Protection Agency has sent its first staff&#13;
member overseas for training in integrated pest management (IPM).&#13;
Effect of the Proposed Project&#13;
8.            One of the major objectives of the project is to establish a sound farm credit program with&#13;
loan officers trained in all aspects of agricultural lending including (environmental) risk assessment.&#13;
Project supported investments at the farm level and in the agro-processing industries are intended to: (a)&#13;
increase the efficiency of the use of agricultural inputs (fuel, fertilizers, pesticides); (b) decrease soil&#13;
erosion by better land use practices; (c) increase energy efficiency through the introduction of new&#13;
equipment; and (d) reduce air pollution through the phasing out of coal fired heat and boiler units. The&#13;
proposed project would support the strengthening of Lithuanian capacities in environmentally sound&#13;
approaches to agriculture through support for the strengthening of agricultural extension services,&#13;
provision of advisory services to agro-processing industries and training of personnel from cooperating&#13;
financial institutions in the environmental review methods.&#13;
9.            Potential impacts associated with proposed small scale projects would be mitigated&#13;
through the adoption and active implementation of environmental screening procedures appropriate for&#13;
intermediate lending operations by cooperating financial institutions and through implementation of&#13;
applicable environmental procedures by national, regional and local entities charged with environmental&#13;
assessment. Monitoring of the environmental aspects of relatively small investment would be conducted&#13;
principally by regional offices and local offices complemented by periodic supervision by environmental&#13;
staff from the Bank's regional office.&#13;
Environmental Management&#13;
10.          An environmental review was prepared for the proposed Project consistent with the&#13;
requirements of Lithuania environmental assessment legislation and the provisions of World Bank&#13;
Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment" and placed in environmental screening category&#13;
"b". The proposed project is expected to result in environmental benefits by supporting a series of small&#13;
scale improvements in a wide range of agricultural practices as recommended by the extension service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                                        89&#13;
11.          Environmental screening and review procedures. The project would include provisions&#13;
of environmental review by Lithuanian environmental authorities of proposed investments. Where&#13;
applicable investments supported under the proposed project would require issuance of permits consistent&#13;
with the applicable Lithuanian land use and environmental procedures (these procedures are to be listed&#13;
in the new Environmental Law; till that time the decrees listed in par. 13 apply. Present environmental&#13;
regulations recognize three layers of authority that regulate and monitor environmental standards:&#13;
(a) At the ground level is the rayon or municipal government. Most small projects (e.g. local&#13;
construction etc.) need only local approval. To obtain such approval the project is reviewed by&#13;
a local committee consisting of the Environmental Affairs specialist in the rayon, the rayon&#13;
Hygienist and, if pesticides are involved, a local representative of the State Plant Protection&#13;
Agency. However, the ability of the bureaucracy to implement varies. The city of Vilnius, for&#13;
example, has created and environmental agency, but in some of the rural rayon the monitoring&#13;
and survey and done by rayon architects or others not directly trained in environmental&#13;
assessment. Progress is being made in training.&#13;
(b)  The Ministry of the Environment has ten regional offices. These offices supervise, among others,&#13;
the rayon level implementation, and specifically handle the environmental assessment of larger&#13;
regional projects and issues. Examples are especially construction investments and investments&#13;
which may create new waste water.&#13;
(c)   Environmental assessment of still larger issues and projects (large scale industrial projects,&#13;
pipelines) is handled by the relevant office in the central Ministry of the Enviromnent.&#13;
12.          The responsibility for environmental monitoring of the relatively small investments (less&#13;
than 1 million litas) made under the project will mainly be at the local (rayon) governments. Few, if any,&#13;
investments or special cases are envisaged to need review by regional offices. Local regulations require&#13;
submission of simple request which includes a one-page form dealing with the use of raw materials and&#13;
the production, storage and management of waste, and, where applicable, the description of the possible&#13;
physical and biological pollutants created by the investment and the remedial counter measures taken.&#13;
With respect to agriculture, these regulations mainly affect construction of dwelling, public building,&#13;
animal production building or facilities, greenhouses except when heated by gas generators) storage&#13;
facilities of crops as well as fuel, well drilling, animal burial sites, power lines and some others.&#13;
13.          Investments in or near protected areas will require special review in the regional offices&#13;
of the Ministry of the Environment. Such special reviews include those made in the "intensive karst zone"&#13;
targeted by the Government for Ground Water Protection and Sustainable Agricultural Development&#13;
(Birzai and Pasvalys rayon).&#13;
14.          The basic procedures for screening of small scale investments are well established and&#13;
documented in recent decrees and regulations (decree 87 of 12/17/90; regulations # 153-93 and decree&#13;
154-60 of 8131/93). These rules are aimed are mainly aimed at larger investments, but will be used to&#13;
ascertain consideration of proper environmental standards preservation of the top soil, solid and liquid&#13;
waste management, proper management of drainage and run-off, as well as of assessment and&#13;
management of the impact of agricultural production related investments such as workshops, storage etc.&#13;
on groundwater quality, on trees, shrubs and plant life, and on wildlife and fish. These rules are to&#13;
ascertain proper construction standards. All infrastructure investment lending under the project would&#13;
require permits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
90                                                                                  Annex 8&#13;
15.          Although these procedures are well established, the project  will emphasize the&#13;
environmental sound and sustainable agricultural procedures, mainly through its extension effort.&#13;
Similarly, the advisory services to the processing industry will also stress the environmental aspects of&#13;
the investments in processing. In addition, the lending institutions will apply the lessons learned during&#13;
the environmental assessment training provided by the World Bank supported Enterprise and Financial&#13;
Sector Restructuring Project, which includes technical assistance support to the banking sector, and&#13;
preparation of an environmental assessment manual.&#13;
16.          Institutional Strengthening Activities. The proposed Project would support the&#13;
strengthening of Lithuanian capacities in environmentally sound approaches to agriculture through&#13;
(a) support for the strengthening of agricultural extension services; including continued training of&#13;
extension personnel and, subsequently farmers, in appropriate pest management practices&#13;
including IPM and proper handling of agro-chemicals;&#13;
(b) the provision of advisory services to the agro-processing industries that would stress the use of&#13;
environmentally sound practices and technologies; and&#13;
(c)  support the training of personnel from cooperating financial institutions in the environmental risk&#13;
assessment of small scale investments in agriculture.&#13;

ANNEX 10: Farm Models&#13;
I.           The relatively poor soils and the cool climate narrow the opportunities of farms in their&#13;
selection of product mix and farming system. The seasons are short, and limited by often wet springs and&#13;
autumns, which may complicate respectively planting and harvesting. However, there are good&#13;
opportunities for root crops, forage, and livestock production. These production systems would greatly&#13;
benefit from improvement in the availability of inputs, equipment, improvements in energy efficiency and&#13;
overall management. The marketing opportunities of quality products is, in the long term, good with&#13;
nearby urban markets such as Vilnius and Kaunas and beyond larger population centers in Kaliningrad,&#13;
Russia, Belarus, and Poland.&#13;
II.           One of the project objective is to assist farmers in the transition from , mainly, large-scale&#13;
collective farning to smaller-scale family farming or, in some cases, farming cooperatives. Apart from&#13;
the change in fanming system, it is also expected that the product mix of farms is going to change and&#13;
probably broaden from the previously mandated cereal production and intensive livestock. In this rapidly&#13;
changing sector, farm lending is likely to concentrate initially on seasonal inputs (seeds, fuel, agro-&#13;
chemicals, fertilizer and small equipment) and limited investments in equipment, buildings, livestock and&#13;
storage facilities. Larger farms may invest also in small scale processing.&#13;
III.         Crop/livestock budaets.  The attached crop and livestock budgets demonstrate the&#13;
difference in outlook of a selected number of crops under present and improved conditions. The examples&#13;
are derived from the crop budgets developed by the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service, in its effort&#13;
to assist Lithuanian farmers to make more rational decisions on crop mix and future investments. These&#13;
budgets are tentative, however, as crop prices are still volatile. Potatoes prices, for example, were high&#13;
in early 1995 due to the drought in 1994 (as such somewhat lower prices were used in the models). Pig&#13;
prices are also high, a trend common throughout the region during 1994-95. Cereal prices, on the other&#13;
hand appear to have reached a more stable level, and may better reflex future price levels. Most of the&#13;
selected crops, except flax and milk, are not subsidized and reflect real market prices.&#13;
IV.          Whole farm models Whole farm models are presented for two typical private farms, one&#13;
which represents the 89ers and one which represents restitution farms. It should, however, be noted that&#13;
major changes in farm system are likely during the course of the Project so that these farm models are&#13;
merely indicative. For instance, the management of grassland is likely to substantially improve through&#13;
the adoption of improved temporary leys using improved seed and the adoption of silage based forage&#13;
systems. The increased efficiency of grassland use will allow improved management of livestock&#13;
increasing the quality of output and stocking densities. In addition, good opportunities exist for some&#13;
private farmers to produce vegetables for urban markets which would generate high margins.&#13;
V.           Example Cashflows for a family farm and an agricultural company (Bendrove) were&#13;
derived from the World Bank supported Farm Survey Report and somewhat modified. They demonstrate&#13;
the present weakness, especially of the agricultural company, where high overhead costs severely depress&#13;
cash flow. Improvement in management and in agronomic practices, to be stimulated through LAAS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94                                                                                  Annex 10&#13;
advice, as well as investments in better inputs, and more efficient production (for example through more&#13;
energy efficient equipment use) may help these farms to improve their performance. The cash flow of&#13;
private farmers appear somewhat better, but here also, major improvements are possible through better&#13;
product choices and greater efficiency.&#13;
VI.           Storage. Apart from investments on the production side, major improvements are&#13;
expected to be made through investment in better storage, transport, and marketing. The impact of&#13;
improved storage is difficult to determine but is probably significant through: (a) reduction in losses in&#13;
the field as well as in storage; (b) increased farm flexibility during harvest time (less weather dependent);&#13;
and (c) increased flexibility in marketing. Table 4 makes an effort to estimate some of the benefits of&#13;
better storage, concentrating on reduced losses, and higher quality. Estimates of the reduction in these&#13;
losses are made, on a per ton basis. These improvements are then aggregated for a total benefit for an&#13;
average farm. A simple rate of return is calculated. The latter are somewhat low, as the chosen farm size&#13;
is rather small. There is a scale element in these investments, and the benefits are likely to be higher in&#13;
larger farms (the alternative of renting out storage space is well possible, but was not considered in this&#13;
simple models).&#13;

Notes:               (a) Improvements resulting from dhe project are based upon (i) increased efficiency, (ii) increased yields, and (iii) improved quality.&#13;
(b) There is likely to be an incresd use of temporary leys as part of the cropping rotation as the project goes on. This would allow stocking densities to be increased.&#13;
(c) There is likely to be an increased use of silage (probably stored covered on concrete slabs or in a pit ather than being wrapped as bails) as the project goes on.&#13;
(d) Grazing and Hay budgets have been included to show the basis of cost estimates included in livestock budgets.&#13;

GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA&#13;
To Mr. Wilfried Thalwitz&#13;
Vice-president&#13;
World Bank&#13;
Vilniust 29 May 1995&#13;
Dear Mr. Thalwitz,&#13;
After regaining its independence, Lithuania started&#13;
a comprohensive agricultural reform  programme aiming at&#13;
transforming agriculture into an efficient system based&#13;
an   the   market  principles   and   private  ownership.&#13;
Agricultural sector is of an exceptional economic and&#13;
social importance for Lithuania. In the preteform period&#13;
the agricultural sector generataed income for one third of&#13;
the population. The first stage of the aqgarian reform&#13;
was carried out rapidly: in two years the former economic&#13;
structures  and  administrative-commanding  r'gulation  oQ&#13;
economic and social relations were eliminate4.&#13;
During the reform the agricultural inpur prices grew&#13;
4-5 times quicker than farm-gate prices. Fa;mers faced a&#13;
rather ditficult situation, because almost all types of&#13;
agricultural production became unprofitable.   Decline in&#13;
production   was   catastrophic.   For   in*tance,   the&#13;
procurement of livestock and poultry in 1994 declined by&#13;
4.6 and of milk 2.5 times if compared to the 1989 level.&#13;
Production of meat per capita during the corresponding&#13;
p-riod- decreased by 58%, milk - 42%, eggs - 47%. The&#13;
majority of agricultural producers found themselves in&#13;
worse conditions because of the lack of i'vestment. Due&#13;
to the aforementioned reasons, income of a laxge group of&#13;
rural population diminished and unemployment increased.&#13;
GOL In pursuit of creating conditions for the development&#13;
of a more efficient agriculture and integration into tLo&#13;
international market must at the same time soften the&#13;
social  impact  of  transition  to  the  ma.rkat  oriented&#13;
economy.&#13;
Following  WS  recommendations,  GOL  "ontinues  to&#13;
implement the reform. For example, since %pril 1 1995&#13;
retail margin control for domestically pxcoduced food&#13;
products has been eliminated by GOL. it also should be&#13;
&#13;

108                                                           Attachment I&#13;
mentioned that after the matter-of-fact discussions with&#13;
WE authorities, the size of the subsidy per 1- liter of&#13;
milk has been reduced  from 0.07 Lt to 0.03 Lt (almoSt&#13;
60%). At present the amourit of subt;idies if *:ompared with&#13;
other countries is very smiall (8t of the total income&#13;
from sales). The subsidias are applied only to some types&#13;
of  products.  The  Government  r*duced  budgetary  funds&#13;
allocated for subsidized credit from 108 mi. lion Litas in&#13;
1994 to 50 million Litas in 1995 (more than cwice).&#13;
GOL is committed to continue reforms, because in the&#13;
long run it will be bGneficial for the courtry. However,&#13;
it  is  the Governmont'6 duty    to relieve  an much  an&#13;
possible the rural population from the hardships it is&#13;
facing today.&#13;
In  order  to  prevent  the  economic- and  social&#13;
situation   of   the   rural   population   form   rapid&#13;
deterioration and ensure at least the minlimal farmers '&#13;
income, the Law on State R4gulation of Economic Relations&#13;
in Agriculture was passed in December 1994. Some of the&#13;
measures  foreseen  in  this  Law  should  be  viewed  an&#13;
temporary ones applied to the transition to the market&#13;
economy.&#13;
Znacting the  Law, the  Government should  set  the&#13;
minim=m marginal procurement prices f or agricultural&#13;
products. However, until now mininum marginal prices in&#13;
Lithuania were set by authorized repre-entatives of&#13;
producers  and  processors   (unions  and  associations)&#13;
without   the   Government's   intervention,   and   were&#13;
foma.lized by mutual agreements. The Govermn.ent does not&#13;
take   any   administrational   actions   restarding   such&#13;
agreements,   because   tho   minimum   macrinal   prices&#13;
determined in these agreements are only tentative and&#13;
much lower than in EU countries. These prices also apply&#13;
to   tho  products  of  particular  social  importance.&#13;
Nevertheless,   the   Government   recognizes   that   such&#13;
mechanism of regulating relations between producers and&#13;
processors of agricultural goods ia not perfect, and,&#13;
therefore, considers it to be a temporary measure.&#13;
At the present stage the Government ia not in a&#13;
position to eliminate the minimum marginal prices fullY.&#13;
However, as it acknowledges a possible negatLve Impact of&#13;
such a policy on the economy, the Government is prepared&#13;
to take further steps:&#13;
* to support by  applying  minimum  marginal prices&#13;
only to the highest quallty beef and milk. Tnat would be&#13;
an additional stimuluS for farmers to improve the&#13;
quality of their production;&#13;
* to eliminate the support for milk and beef&#13;
producers gradually  by the  end of 1999. This aid  for&#13;
farmsrs . will  be  replaced  by  the  system  of  direct&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                 109&#13;
The subsidized credits to agjvicultural entities is a&#13;
partial  compensation  for growing  bank  intarest  rates&#13;
because of inflation and unfavourabla situa ion in credit&#13;
markets, which impedes the implementation of agricultural&#13;
transformation projects. Cturrently Lithuania faces many&#13;
limitations which hamper the developinent of the system of&#13;
commercial lending for agriculture. First, farmers lack&#13;
collateralt partially  because of malfunctioning of land&#13;
market.  Second,  relatively  high  costs  o0f small loan&#13;
administration. Third, low profitability of farming.&#13;
For that reason the 'Government had to continue to&#13;
fill the gap as long as the obstacles are eLiminated. The&#13;
Government recognizes that the subsidized credit in the&#13;
long  run  is  not  an efficient moasure  ard,  therefore,&#13;
foresees to substitute it gradually by other means of&#13;
direct support in the future.&#13;
We ensure you that the current Amount of subsidized&#13;
credit for 1995 will not be increased. The Government&#13;
tends to. continue to reduce budgetary funds allocated f6r&#13;
oubsidized credit, however, we would like to emphasize&#13;
that this reduction depends to a great extent on the&#13;
opportunity to use alternative resources of credits&#13;
including WS credit line. The sooner WS loan is available&#13;
for Lithuania, the sooner the Government will be able to&#13;
reduce and gradually eliminate subsidized credit.&#13;
In addition to the above mentioned measures, to&#13;
.strengthen   and   accelerate   the   transiormation   cf&#13;
a ricalture to the market based system, the Government&#13;
will undertake the following stops:&#13;
*  GOL  will  expedite  the  restitutlon   of  land&#13;
ownership and will aim to proces3 all the restitution&#13;
claims  by  the  end  of 1999, and issue  tLtles  to the&#13;
already restituted land. GOL will initiate an amendment&#13;
to  the  existing  legislation  and  grant  the  right of&#13;
selling land to Lithuanian and foreign legal persons and&#13;
foreign citizens;&#13;
* GOL plans to sell the majority of Government&#13;
shares in processing and agricultural service companies&#13;
to agricultural producers in order to create favourable&#13;
preconditions for innovation and competition,&#13;
We believe that WB comprehends the difficulties of&#13;
the agricultural sector reform in Lithualia and the&#13;
importance to preserve general and social stability. We&#13;
hope that WE will take into consideration the complexity&#13;
and  the  dynamic  nature  of  changes  of  the  curret.t&#13;
situat$on. It will take some time to correct the past&#13;
distortions *. We are firmly detezmined to continue the&#13;
refof= and transf ormations at the paLce which would not&#13;
increase social risks.&#13;
On  behalf  of  the Government  of  the  tepublic of&#13;
Lithuania we would like to assure you once 4gain that we&#13;

PRIVATE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
I. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.           This Project Implementation Plan was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture with the&#13;
support of the Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Team during appraisal and will be&#13;
agreed upon in accordance with the procedures set out in the OP/BP/GB 10.00. The complete design is&#13;
presented as an overview in Chart 1 below.&#13;
B. Project Scope and Objectives&#13;
2.           The Private Agricultural Development Project (The Project) would increase the&#13;
availability of commercial credit to private farmers, privatised state or collective farms (known as&#13;
Agricultural Companies), agricultural and food processors, agro-service companies and rural&#13;
enterprises, and support the market orientation of the agricultural, food, and rural sectors with&#13;
appropriate Technical Assistance in accordance with the following objectives:&#13;
*        to strengthen and restructure rural credit delivery systems;&#13;
*        to increase the availability of finance for the upgrading of technology and&#13;
production facilities;&#13;
*        to foster the development of private farms and promote the emergence of private&#13;
small and medium enterprises in rural areas;&#13;
*        to provide seed money, retraining, and advice for the development of opportunities&#13;
for income and employment generation in rural areas and the diversification of&#13;
farm businesses;&#13;
*        to help establish land markets and tradeable private land ownership rights and&#13;
increase access to credit by establishing legally binding collateral;&#13;
*        to improve the efficiency with which markets indicate consumers wants and needs&#13;
through improving the institutional framework of markets (including improved&#13;
price dissemination);&#13;
*        to improve the business management skills and marketing ability of farmers and&#13;
entrepreneurs so that they can identify, evaluate, and pursue business development&#13;
opportunities which improve productivity and the competativeness of Lithuanian&#13;
products in domestic and export markets; and thereby reduce poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
112                                                               Project Implementation Plan&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.            Both multilateral and bilateral donors have supported the development of the Lithuanian&#13;
agricultural and food sector which is the second largest in the Lithuanian economy. This support has&#13;
assisted Lithuania in its transformation of the agricultural and food economies to a system where&#13;
resources are allocated by markets according to the prices that are the result of consumers' purchasing&#13;
behaviour.  However, to date much of the Technical Assistance has been directed towards the&#13;
investment in physical capital which was required to promote land reform, establish an extension&#13;
organisation, and provide agricultural machinery and vehicles. The Agricultural and Food Sector&#13;
Review indicated that despite this assistance there still exist some important constraints to the&#13;
development of a competitive market based food distribution chain to the detriment of farmers and&#13;
consumers alike.&#13;
4.            A competitive market economy requires a large number of buyers and sellers, the wide&#13;
availability of information (especially market information), and access to capital.  Since these&#13;
conditions are not currently satisfied in Lithuania the proposed Project will be implemented as an&#13;
Investment Project the main components of which will be:&#13;
Long term credit for on- and off-farm investments, seasonal credits for farm&#13;
inputs and initial working capital for processors;&#13;
Institutional and human resource development through Technical Assistance to&#13;
improve the capacity of those involved in the agricultural and food sectors to&#13;
respond to market signals through the development of agricultural market and&#13;
technical information sources, and business and technical skills as well as for&#13;
the development of the land market in Lithuania.&#13;
5.            Credit Component. The lack of available credit is hindering the establishment of new&#13;
firms or the development of existing firms undertaking agricultural input and service supply (including&#13;
machinery service contractors), small and medium sized agro processing, and market intermediaries&#13;
such as wholesalers, traders and distributors. This is limiting competition particularly in the agro-&#13;
processing sector which is highly oligopolistic. This is an important reason for the poor prices that&#13;
farmers receive and the substantial delays before they are paid. The lack of credit is also hindering the&#13;
development of the large number of new private farmers and the Agricultural Companies which were&#13;
created from the privatised non-land assets of the former State and Collective farms. Consequently, the&#13;
primary agricultural producers are having difficulty developing their production and competing with the&#13;
quality of imported products. The results of the farm survey conducted by the Lithuanian Agricultural&#13;
Advisory Service, the Association of Agricultural Companies and the Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian&#13;
Economics with the assistance of the PHRD Team, confirmed that both private farmers and&#13;
Agricultural Companies (the privatised former state and collective farms) have a large demand for long&#13;
term credit. The farm survey also indicated that currently they lack such credit. Additionally there is a&#13;
need to develop alternative employment opportunities in rural areas which will help to alleviate both the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                                                               113&#13;
rising unemployment that results from farm and enterprise restructuring as well as the low incomes&#13;
generated by the large number of small farms.&#13;
6.            Consequently, in order to increase the availability of long term credit to private farms,&#13;
Agricultural Companies, farm service companies, small and medium sized agro-processors, and rural&#13;
enterprises a $30 million Line-of-Credit will be extended to Lithuania. The World Bank will provide&#13;
the loan to the Government of Lithuania (GOL) in the form of a Single Currency Loan at the Banks'&#13;
standard variable interest rate which is adjusted every six months. The loan will be repaid according to&#13;
terms and conditions agreed at negotiations.&#13;
7.            The credit will be channelled to sub-borrowers through participating financial&#13;
intermediaries (PFIs) which will draw upon the Line-of-Credit with the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) acting&#13;
as an APEX agency on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. For each eligible sub-loan that they make,&#13;
PFIs will be able to draw upon the Line-of-Credit in either US$ or Litas dependant upon the currency&#13;
within which the sub-loan is denominated. Where PFIs draw upon the Line-of-Credit in US$ the BOL&#13;
shall add to the interest rate changed by the World Bank , a margin to cover administration costs and&#13;
repayment risks. Where the PFIs draw upon the Line-of-Credit in Litas, BOL shall on lend at a&#13;
variable market determined interest rate which shall be set in relation to the BOL's refinancing or&#13;
rediscount rate.&#13;
8.            It is expected that the PFIs shall be private commercial banks' which satisfy World&#13;
Bank eligibility criteria and the Agricultural Bank of Lithuanian (ABL) once it meets the eligibility&#13;
criteria applied by the World Bank. The PFIs will bear the full credit risks of the sub-projects financed&#13;
from the Line-of-Credit.&#13;
9.            Potential sub-borrowers will apply to a PFI for a sub-loan.  Sub-loans may be&#13;
denominated either in US$, in which case the sub-borrower bears the exchange rate risk, or in Litas, in&#13;
which case the government will bear the exchange rate risk. The interest rates charged by PFIs on sub-&#13;
loans in US$ or Litas shall be variable and determined by PFIs according to their risk assessment of the&#13;
sub-project, their lending costs and the costs of funds on lent by the Apex Unit. Interest rates shall be&#13;
market determined and positive in real terms. Applications will be assessed by each PFI on the basis of&#13;
the commercial viability of the proposed sub-project.  Applicants will need to demonstrate such&#13;
viability by undertaking feasibility studies which will detail the technical, economic, financial and&#13;
environmental soundness of the sub-project. In order to promote small investment projects, and&#13;
thereby improve competition in the sector, there will be a limit of US$250 thousand on the total size of&#13;
sub-loans that can be made under the Project to a single borrower. Since the proposed Bank loan is&#13;
intended to assist the development of private enterprise in the agricultural, food and rural sectors there&#13;
will be an additional restriction that companies will only be eligible for a loan under this credit line if&#13;
there is a least 51 % private ownership of the company. All activities financed under the Line-of-Credit&#13;
would be required to comply with GOL environmental standards. Terms and conditions, including&#13;
interest rates and repayment conditions, of sub-loans shall be determined by the PFIs upon strictly&#13;
The private commercial banks have not yet been selected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114                                                              Project Implementation Plan&#13;
commercial criteria subject to the following provisos: the loan repayment schedule shall not extend&#13;
beyond the productive life of investments made; the maximum repayment period shall be limited to 12&#13;
years; and any period of repayment grace shall not exceed 3 years. Grace and amortisation periods&#13;
would be based on the type of investment financed and the projected cash flow, and would be&#13;
commesurate with the repayment capacity of sub-borrowers.&#13;
10.          Institutional and Human Resource Development Component. The development of&#13;
human capital is now a priority for the further development of the whole food distribution chain and for&#13;
the promotion of employment in rural areas. This component would therefore consist of Technical&#13;
Assistance to assist in the following areas:&#13;
Marketing. Currently within Lithuania agricultural and food production is not determined&#13;
according to the wants and need of consumers as expressed through market signals or market&#13;
research. There are a variety of reasons for this. Paramount is the lack of market institutions&#13;
for the trading of agricultural inputs and outputs which result in primary agricultural producers&#13;
having a lack of choice as to purchased inputs and a lack of buyers for their output. This limits&#13;
competition amongst input suppliers and agro-processors so that primary producers pay higher&#13;
input prices and receive lower output prices than otherwise would be the case. This problem is&#13;
compounded by private farmers' lack of adequate storage and transportation facilities which&#13;
further impedes their inter-temporal and spatial marketing decisions. A lack of experience of&#13;
market behaviour over time and between locations together with a lack of market information&#13;
also hinders such decision making.&#13;
In addition to these problems related to the under development of market institutions, farmers&#13;
also face a lack of demand for their output. A main reason for this is that the output of many&#13;
Lithuanian agro-processors does not satisfy the wants or needs of consumers in the domestic or&#13;
export markets. There are a variety of reasons for this including a lack of trained marketing&#13;
professionals and the lack of an effective trade promotion agency.&#13;
Consequently the following Technical Assistance programmes shall be undertaken to alleviate&#13;
these problems:&#13;
Farm Level Marketing - The Development of Marketing Institutions: To assist the creation of a&#13;
decentralised market economy through the development of Lithuanian experience in the&#13;
establishment and operation of agricultural market institutions.&#13;
Agricultural Market Education: To assist participants in the agricultural markets develop their&#13;
experience of the determinants of market prices including the effects of product quality and&#13;
location, and the causes of price movements in the short, medium and longer terms.&#13;
Food Marketing Training Courses: To improve the marketing abilities of those involved in the&#13;
production and sale of processed agricultural products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                                                            115&#13;
Trade Information Development: To assist the Agricultural Trade Agency, to be established by&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture, create a service for the collection, processing, storage and&#13;
dissemination of trade data.&#13;
Product Workshops: To improve the export performance of the agricultural, food and fishery&#13;
sectors of the Lithuanian economy.&#13;
Export Promotion: To assist the development of Lithuanian skills in the production of export&#13;
promotional material and the undertaking of an international trade mission.&#13;
Business Skill Development.   The ability for entrepreneurs and business consultants to&#13;
prepare rational business plans and studies of the feasibility of investments is vital for the&#13;
success of the credit component of the project. Although Lithuanian capability in these areas is&#13;
developing there is a need for the training of private farmers and managers of Agricultural&#13;
Companies who currently tend to lack the business skills and experience required to plan sound&#13;
investments and effectively manage their enterprises. Private farmers require simple training to&#13;
understand the profitability, cashflow and capital position of their businesses as a priority and&#13;
subsequent training in the judgement of project feasibility. The managers of Agricultural&#13;
Companies require training in methods to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their&#13;
businesses and in the skills to implement the changes required.&#13;
Thus the following Technical Assistance programmes will be undertaken:&#13;
Training Private Farmers in Understanding and Judging Feasibility: To assist Lithuanian&#13;
institutions develop and deliver training courses for private farmers on the concept and&#13;
techniques required to develop feasible investment projects.&#13;
Agricultural Company Management Training: To strengthen and develop the managerial&#13;
capacity of the Agricultural Companies and thereby aid the process of their transformation.&#13;
Extension System  Development.  In 1993 the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service&#13;
(LAAS) was established and in a short space of time this organisation has made great progress&#13;
in providing extension services to private farmers. The establishment of the organisation was&#13;
greatly assisted by EU-PHARE which provided much of the physical investment required&#13;
(vehicles, technical equipment, computers, office equipment and supplies, etc.). LAAS has&#13;
also received technical assistance and training from a variety of countries including Denmark&#13;
and Sweden and organisations such as VOCA.  Currently LAAS is receiving Technical&#13;
Assistance funded by EU-PHARE and the British Government's Know How Fund. These&#13;
technical assistance programmes are providing training for farm advisors and financing an&#13;
experienced co-director to assist the director of LAAS with strategic planning and to co-&#13;
ordinate the training input. Although the advisory service is developing well, other aspects of&#13;
the farm extension system remain under developed and there is a need to increase the flow of&#13;
information from research and education organisations and the Ministry of Agriculture to the&#13;
advisory service and farmers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116                                                               Project Implementation Plan&#13;
The Ministry of Agriculture is a key organisation within the overall extension system since it&#13;
has the roles of fostering competitive agricultural and food sectors through its policy making&#13;
role and through the production and dissemination of information.&#13;
In order to be able to increase the flow of information it is necessary that appropriate&#13;
information collection systems are developed. Currently, the rapid privatisation of the farm&#13;
sector has resulted in a lack of reliable information since the information systems collected data&#13;
from the former state and collective farms (the non-land assets of which have been privatised&#13;
into "Agricultural Companies") rather than private farms.&#13;
Consequently the following Technical Assistance programmes shall be undertaken:&#13;
Flexible Extension System Development: To further the development of the whole extension&#13;
system by facilitating the two-way flow of information through the system so that it meets the&#13;
need of farmers.&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture Management Training: To facilitate the adaptation of the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and related institutions to their new role of fostering a competitive market based&#13;
economy.&#13;
The Further Development of the Census of Farm Businesses: To reduce the cost of undertaking&#13;
the Institute of Statistic's census of farm businesses so that it may be undertaken on an annual&#13;
basis.&#13;
The Development of a Survey of Private Farm Accounts: To implement a survey of farm&#13;
accounts that is broadly compatible with similar surveys used in market based economies.&#13;
Survey of Farmer Opinion: To provide information on the opinions and perceptions of farmers&#13;
and thereby aid the monitoring and evaluation of the Private Agricultural Development Project.&#13;
Rural Employment Generation. The privatisation of the farm sector through the restitution of&#13;
land and the privatisation of the non-land assets of the state and collective farms into&#13;
Agricultural Companies will inevitably result in: the creation of a large number of small farms&#13;
which are of insufficient size to generate sufficient income to satisfy all the expenditure needs&#13;
of a family; and an increase in visible unemployment as the Agricultural Companies restructure&#13;
and shed the labour which currently constitutes hidden unemployment. Therefore, increasingly&#13;
there will be a need for members of families operating small farms to undertake alternative&#13;
income generating activities, on- or off-farm, in addition to farming. Likewise, in order to&#13;
avoid rural depopulation, there will be a need to assist rural communities develop new job&#13;
opportunities. It has been noted by the Women Farmers' Union that within Lithuania in many&#13;
cases it is females on farms that are attempting to undertake alternative activities. Thus in&#13;
order that the assistance meets the identified needs in Lithuania and to avoid the female rural&#13;
population being economically disenfranchised by the restructuring and development process a&#13;
large part of the assistance shall be targeted at the needs of the female rural population. A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                                                             117&#13;
Technical Assistance programme shall be undertaken to: stimulate the development of&#13;
alternative rural employment opportunities by raising the awareness of the rural population to&#13;
alternative opportunities, assisting the development of demonstration community based projects&#13;
(particularly those undertaken by females), and providing training specifically directed towards&#13;
the needs of female farmers.&#13;
Rural Business Development Center (RBC). Experience demonstrates that stimulating the&#13;
new employment required to compensate for losses resulting from structural adjustment is a&#13;
difficult task. Local populations usually have little experience of utilising their own enterprise&#13;
and businesses that are set up have high failure rates. Experience also shows that agencies&#13;
established to provide business support can have great success in fostering indigenous&#13;
enterprise and nurturing new businesses through the critical first few years. The skills required&#13;
in such agencies extend far beyond the standard business consulting functions. First, such&#13;
agencies must adopt a proactive approach - if they do not, potential business opportunities are&#13;
lost either through the inability of untrained individuals to express them clearly or through the&#13;
fear that they will not be taken seriously. Second, the agencies must have a sound ability to be&#13;
able to recognise potentially viable projects based upon little information so as to be able to&#13;
screen out business ideas that have little or no chance of success.  Staff seconded from&#13;
successful businesses are crucial in order to fulfil this role. Third, the agency must act as a&#13;
facilitator, drawing together individuals with the appropriate skills to support the development&#13;
of specific business proposals. Such individuals may include those with the skills required to&#13;
judge market potential and technical feasibility, as well as those that can assist businesses&#13;
undertake financial analyses and prepare marketing strategies.  Since different business&#13;
proposals would require different expertise, rarely would such an agency maintain all the skills&#13;
within the organisation. Extensive contacts are therefore vital to the operation of the agency.&#13;
Currently, no such agency exists within Lithuania. The consulting companies that do exist&#13;
have inevitably have concentrated their efforts on improving the communication and presenting&#13;
of business proposals through the preparation of business plans and investment feasibility&#13;
studies. Even where these are based upon sound models and accounting principles they usually&#13;
ignore the changes occurring within the Lithuanian economy, the need to target the wants and&#13;
needs of consumers and the problems of business management (especially the need for&#13;
flexibility). Thus, such an agency - the Rural Business Development Centre - will be&#13;
established to fulfil these functions. The agency will primarily be innovative in adopting&#13;
strategies to foster new business developments thereby easing unemployment. It will however,&#13;
undertake such actions as are necessary to strengthen the financial and marketing ability of&#13;
managers and consultants alike. Where appropriate the RBC will pre-qualify local consulting&#13;
companies to assure the quality of services supplied to Project beneficiaries.&#13;
Land Reform. The current land reform programme has its roots in 1989 when it became&#13;
possible for individual farmers to lease up to 50 hectares of agricultural land on favourable&#13;
conditions. In 1991 a new land reform law was passed the prime objective of which was (i) to&#13;
restore land and real property rights to those who had owned land prior to 1940 and to their&#13;
heirs; and (ii) to privatise land that had been held by collective farms. The land laws were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
118                                                               Project Implementation Plan&#13;
further amended in 1993 and 1994 in the light of experience with operating the restitution&#13;
programme. A new draft law on land registration is now (1995) in preparation. A law on&#13;
mortgaging land was passed in 1992 but has not yet been implemented. A law governing&#13;
physical planning and development control is only in draft form. Some ten per cent of farm&#13;
lands have been surveyed to a sufficient standard for the issue of a certificate of title while a&#13;
further thirty per cent have been marked out roughly on the ground.&#13;
As a result of these difficulties as yet there is no active land market in Lithuania. An active&#13;
land market would further the allocation of land between alternative uses on the basis of the&#13;
economic returns from different activities. Lenders would also be encouraged to accept land as&#13;
security for loans since valuations could be based upon real market transactions and lenders&#13;
would be able to readily realise their collateral. The establishment of a land market should be&#13;
encouraged by speeding up the restitution of land, the creation of an efficient land register&#13;
containing only legally required and guaranteed informnation, the provision of legal support for&#13;
the drafting of land related legislation; and an improved Lithuanian capability in the valuation&#13;
of land. The following Technical Assistance programs shall therefore be undertaken.&#13;
Legislative and Administrative Development: To foster the development of a land market in&#13;
Lithuania by the provision of specialist assistance for the further development of applicable&#13;
legislation and administration systems, increasing the efficiency of the system, the development&#13;
of skills in the management of cadastral data and increasing the capacity for cost recovery.&#13;
Land Information System: To continue the on-going development work on the land information&#13;
system required to legally guarantee land transactions.&#13;
Rural Credit Systems. A survey of private commercial banks indicated that whilst they were&#13;
interested in participating in the Project as lenders to agro-processing companies they were&#13;
unlikely to be willing to lend for on-farm development. Conversely, whilst the Agricultural&#13;
Bank of Lithuania has indicated its interest in on-lending the line-of-credit to farmers and&#13;
agricultural companies (as well as other eligible sub-borrowers) it currently does not satisfy&#13;
World Bank eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Project as a PFI. The Government is&#13;
however committed to ensure that the ABL becomes eligible to act as a PFI. It is therefore in&#13;
the process of improving the capital structure of the bank through the removal of bad loans&#13;
resulting from past politically directed lending from ABL's portfolio and is considering&#13;
subscribing to new share capital in ABL. Technical Assistance will therefore be provided to&#13;
assist the ABL in its institutional development and improve its lending procedures. The&#13;
following Technical Assistance will therefore be provided.&#13;
Rural Banking: To prepare a Rural Credit Manual for all PFIs.&#13;
Institutional Development Program for ABL: To improve the operational structure and policies&#13;
of ABL so as to be an eligible PFI under the PADP. The assistance program will include&#13;
support for the development of the following twelve key areas: Planning, Budgeting and&#13;
Performance; The Measurement Process, Organisational Restructuring; Human Resource&#13;

D. Project Costs&#13;
12.       Total Base Costs of the Lithuanian Private Agricultural Development Project are estimated&#13;
at US$ 54.8 million. This Base Cost estimate is based upon the cost estimates prepared by the PHRD&#13;
team assisting the Ministry of Agriculture.&#13;
The Credit Component of the Project will consist of a US$ 30 million Line-of-&#13;
Credit in the form of a World Bank loan, This will be disbursed via the&#13;
participating financial intermediaries. Sub-borrowers would be required to&#13;
make the following contributions toward sub-project costs: no less than 15% in&#13;
cash or in-kind for individual farmers; and no less than 20% in cash or in-kind&#13;
for all others. For new investment by enterprises, the self contribution in cash&#13;
or in-kind would be at least 30%. Loan funds would be disbursed to the PFIs&#13;
as follows: 100% of the eligible sub-loans approved by PFIs in the first&#13;
eighteen months of the Project, 85% of the eligible subloans approved in the&#13;
following 12 months and 75% of eligible subloans approved in the remaining&#13;
period of project implementation. During the life of the Project the PFIs&#13;
contribution to the project costs will increase up to 25% of the subloan&#13;
amounts to be approved. The local contribution for investment is estimated to&#13;
be US $16.7 million equivalent.&#13;
The estimated base cost of the Institutional and Human Resource Development&#13;
component of the project is US$8.1 million.&#13;
13.       Total Project Costs are estimated at US$54.8 million. This estimate does not include&#13;
allowances for physical and price contingencies. This is due to the fact that the Bank contribution is the&#13;
US$ 30 million Line-of-Credit. The Institutional and Human Resource Development Component of the&#13;
Project will be grant financed by bilateral and multilateral donors and from EU counterpart funds&#13;
which will be used to fmance local costs involved in running the Rural Business Development Centre.&#13;
The costs given are indicative and the final costs will be the result of each individual donor's&#13;
procurement practices.&#13;
14.      Foreign Exchange:  The foreign exchange component is estimated to be 66%  of the&#13;
estimated Total Project Cost.&#13;

II. IMPLEMENTING ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Organisations Responsible for the Project and Interagency Co-ordination&#13;
17.              Background. In response to the transformation of the economy from a command to&#13;
a market based system the Ministry of Agriculture is restructuring its operations. This restructuring&#13;
reflects the necessity of the Ministry to foster a competitive economy based upon private&#13;
entrepreneurship rather than directing production activities. Consequently a decentralised approach has&#13;
been adopted to Project implementation. The Minister of Agriculture will be responsible for the&#13;
Institutional and Human Resource component of the Project and will be assisted in this by the creation&#13;
of a dedicated Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Ministry and a related Agricultural&#13;
Technical Unit which will be independent of the Ministry. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the&#13;
Bank of Lithuania (BOL) acting as an APEX organisation will be responsible for the Credit component&#13;
of the Project.&#13;
18.              Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU in the Ministry of Agriculture will be&#13;
headed by a Deputy Minister reporting directly to the Minister in order to ensure a high level of&#13;
accountability and co-ordination. The PMU will co-ordinate project implementation and will oversee&#13;
the implementation of the Technical Assistance programmes which comprise the Institutional and&#13;
Human Resource Development Component of the Private Agricultural Development Project and other&#13;
multilateral and bilateral technical assistance.&#13;
19.       Rural Business Development Centre (RBC). The RBC will be established to support private&#13;
investment in Lithuanian farm, forestry, agro-processing and rural enterprises by promoting excellence&#13;
in the provision of business advisory services through its co-ordination, referral and co-operative role&#13;
and through the development of human capital and practical business intelligence. The RBC will&#13;
therefore play a major role in Project implementation. It will foster the development of new business&#13;
proposals, assist entrepreneurs identify appropriate sources of professional advice, and where the&#13;
necessary skills are lacking shall in the short-term ensure that the needs of private investors are satisfied&#13;
and in the medium-term take remedial action to improve private provision of the services required by&#13;
investors. The RBC shall also enhance the flow of information to entrepreneurs by developing relevant&#13;
databases of information required by the entrepreneurs in the agricultural, food and rural sectors of the&#13;
economy and by hosting seminars for relevant to the business community. The RBC shall additionally&#13;
assist sub-borrowers undertake procurement in accordance with Bank guidelines. In order to facilitate&#13;
the rapid implementation of the Project by increasing the flow of potential sub-projects to the banks&#13;
selected as Participating Financial Intermediaries, the RBC shall act in conjunction with foreign experts&#13;
providing technical assistance to stimulate the development of alternative employment opportunities in&#13;
rural areas. As part of a pilot-project in a selected district of Lithuania the RBC shall provide intensive&#13;
assistance to develop potential sub-projects identified by the foreign experts and shall prepare the&#13;
feasibility studies which PFIs will require to appraisal proposed sub-projects.&#13;
21.              Participating Financial Intermediaries. Banks which meet the eligibility criteria&#13;
outlined in the Staff Appraisal Report that wish to on-lend the Line-of-Credit to eligible sub-projects in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
126                                                             Project Implementation Plan&#13;
accordance with the objectives of the Private Agricultural Development Project shall be invited to&#13;
become Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs). It is expected that the PFIs shall include both&#13;
private commercial banks and the Agricultural Bank of Lithuania (ABL). Currently the ABL would not&#13;
satisfy the eligibility criteria referred to. However, the Government is committed to rectifying this&#13;
situation at the earliest opportunity and is undertaking remedial action so as to improve the capital&#13;
adequacy of the ABL. An Institutional Development Programme for the ABL has also been included in&#13;
the Institutional and Human Resource Development Component of the Project and multilateral donor&#13;
grant funding (EU-PHARE) has been agreed to support this Technical Assistance. The management of&#13;
the ABL is committed to implementing the required institutional restructuring so as to become a viable&#13;
and fully commercial bank. In addition, in order to further this, the Government has committed itself&#13;
to phasing out its use of the ABL as a channel for subsidised credit2 to the agricultural sector and, in the&#13;
interim, when acting as a fiscal agent of the Government the ABL shall not bear any lending risk.&#13;
22.              Ministry of Finance and Bank of Lithuania. The Government of Lithuania will act&#13;
as Guarantor of the loan and hence the Ministry of Finance shall bear ultimately responsibility for loan&#13;
repayment.  In order to ensure banking propriety the Bank of Lithuania shall act as an Apex&#13;
organisation. Technical Assistance has previously been provided to the BOL by organisations such as&#13;
the World Bank, the IMF and the US Treasury in order to improve bank regulation and supervision.&#13;
Additional assistance is being provided with US Aid's support to further improve the system with&#13;
particular regard to on-site examination of banks. As part of the World Bank Enterprise and Financial&#13;
Sector Assistance Project the BOL has created an Apex unit directly responsible to the Director of the&#13;
International Department. The four staff of the Apex shall have received training in Washington on&#13;
World Bank procedures.&#13;

the PFIs in accordance with the terms and conditions stipulated in the&#13;
subsidiary loan agreement;&#13;
iv)          assure the compliance with audit requirements in co-ordination with the PMU;&#13;
v)           provide the MOF, the PMU and the World Bank such information on the above&#13;
as they may reasonably request; and&#13;
vi)          the APEX  unit would work closely with the BOL's Bank Supervision&#13;
Department in assessing the initial and continuing compliance of participating&#13;
banks with the Bank's eligibility criteria.  This notwithstanding, the final&#13;
determination of the bank's eligibility to enter, and continue to participate, in&#13;

the PADP would rest with the Bank of Lithuania Banking Supervision&#13;
Department, subject to World Bank approval.&#13;
D. Role of the World Bank during Supervision&#13;
33.              Given the limited experience of implementing World Bank projects in Lithuania,&#13;
the range of donor co-financiers, the breadth of the TA package and the inexperience of potential&#13;
investors, there will be a major role for World Bank supervision. The establishment of the PMU will&#13;
provide effective initial implementation of the project but, to ensure that objectives are being met and&#13;
that problems are rapidly identified and solved, ongoing monitoring and supervision will be required.&#13;
Whilst the objectives of the Project are both clear defined and fixed, the implementation methodology&#13;
to achieve these objectives has been designed to be flexible so that the Project can respond to the on-&#13;
going transformation that is taking place within Lithuania. This greatly increases the importance of the&#13;
supervision exercise.&#13;
34.              Supervision highlights.  Since this is the first World Bank project for the&#13;
agricultural sector of Lithuania, there will be three supervision missions in each of the first two years.&#13;
Thereafter supervision missions will be twice yearly. Supervision will include:&#13;
(a)          a project start-up mission to check the operation, accounting and reporting&#13;
procedures;&#13;
(b)          a mid-term review to be carried out after 24 months; and&#13;
(c)          a project completion review to be carried out within six months of closing of&#13;
the Project.&#13;
35.              Objectives. The supervision exercise will study problems highlighted by the PMU&#13;
progress reports and review: the performance of implementing agencies including the PMU, RBC, the&#13;
Apex Unit of BOL, the ABL and other PFIs; the financial conditions of PFIs; the achievement of&#13;
specified measurable outputs and overall project objectives; changes in the business environment and&#13;
progress with privatisation; policy issues and conditionalities; and the performance and effectiveness of&#13;
the required Technical Assistance provided by donors. Supervision missions shall also take decisions on&#13;
cases which do not fit the normal project criteria and study the impact of the project on a range of&#13;
individual sub-borrowers. An overall objective is to adapt the project over time to meet changing&#13;
needs and market conditions.&#13;
36.              Outputs. An aide-memoir for each supervision mission will draw conclusions on&#13;
progress and recommend changes. The aide-memoir will be circulated to GOL, World Bank,&#13;
implementing agencies and donors. Back to office reports will also be prepared by World Bank staff.&#13;
37.             Mission participants. Supervision missions will ordinarily consist of the World&#13;
Bank Task Manager and a banking/financial specialist. Since the majority of the Technical Assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
132                                                            Project Implementation Plan&#13;
programmes are directed towards investment in human capital a training specialist shall join the&#13;
supervision missions as required by the Task Manager. Additional specialists from the areas of&#13;
Marketing, Agricultural Economics/Policy, or Extension may be required to join supervision missions&#13;
from  time to time.  Since this is the first World Bank agricultural project in Lithuania a&#13;
disbursement/procurement specialist is also likely to be required. To improve cost-effectiveness, where&#13;
appropriate, World Bank Regional Mission staff for the Baltic Countries will be included. These staff&#13;
now have some experience from the existing World Bank programmes in the region. In accordance&#13;
with co-financing agreements, representatives from EU-PHARE and other donors will be invited to&#13;
participate in the major supervision missions. The exact number of participants in given supervision&#13;
missions is difficult to predict. The estimates given below are consequently very tentative.&#13;
III. IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES&#13;
A. Timebound Schedule&#13;
39.             Credit Component. PFIs will in the be eligible to utilise the Line-of-Credit for the&#13;
five years of the Project.&#13;
40.             Institutional and Human Resource Development Component. Detailed Terms of&#13;
Reference have been prepared for each Technical Assistance programme proposed to assist the&#13;
development of the Lithuanian agricultural and food sector and the rural economy. These TORs are&#13;
available upon request.  Summaries of the Project preparation, implementation and monitoring&#13;
activities are presented below in Chart 2.&#13;
B. Procurement Arrangements and Schedule&#13;
41.             Credit:  Procurement will be undertaken in accordance with World Bank&#13;
guidelines (issued in January 1995) customary for financial intermediary operations. In particular,&#13;
where the goods and works to be procured are estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract procurement will be undertaken according to normal commercial practice and where this limit&#13;
is exceeded procurement shall be undertaken in accordance with the International Shopping procedures&#13;
on the basis of three price quotations from two different countries. Since the maximum eligible sub-&#13;
loan to any individual borrower will be US$250,000 it is not expected that International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) procedures would be applied to sub-loans under this project. However, in the unlikely&#13;
event that special dispensation were allowed, contracts for the supply of goods and works with an&#13;
estimated value of US$ 500,000 or greater would be procured according to ICB procedures.&#13;
Proprietary items and those only available from one supplier may be acquired by direct contracting.&#13;
Procurement documentation shall be submitted to the World Bank for review prior to the first two&#13;
contracts to be procured by International Shopping and submitted by each PFI for any contract to be&#13;
procured by ICB.&#13;

donors. Procurement will be undertaken according to each donor's practices.&#13;
43.             Procurement Review. Procurement procedures shall regularly be reviewed by the&#13;
PMU and the PMU shall assist the World Bank supervision missions monitor and evaluate the&#13;
procurement practice of PFIs and sub-borrowers.&#13;

C. Disbursements&#13;
44.              The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over five years from&#13;
effectiveness. Evidence from the survey of Lithuanian farms undertaken during the sumnmer of 1994&#13;
and local expert opinion suggests that there is strong demand for long term credit from the agricultural&#13;
and food sectors in Lithuania. The major constraint upon effective utilisation of the Line-of-Credit is&#13;
likely to be the lack of experience of farmers, entrepreneurs and their advisors in undertaking studies of&#13;
the feasibility of intended investments ad the lack of experience of the loan officers of the PFIs in&#13;
undertaking the commercial assessment of loan applications. Thus, it is expected that only 25 % of the&#13;
loan will be disbursed in the first eighteen months of the Project. However, once there is greater&#13;
Lithuanian experience in these areas, it is expected that disbursement will become faster so that 30% of&#13;
the loan will be disbursed in the following 12 months and 45% in the remaining implementation period.&#13;
45.              In order to alleviate the constraints on the effective utilisation of the Line-of-Credit&#13;
it is vital that the Institutional and Human Resource Development component of the proposed project is&#13;
undertaken as a matter of urgency so as to assist the development of Lithuanian capability in&#13;
undertaking feasibility studies and loan evaluations. It is also important that the appropriate allocation&#13;
of scarce resources within the agricultural, food and rural sectors and between these and other sectors&#13;
of the Lithuanian economy is further encouraged by assistance for the development of a competitive&#13;
market based economy in Lithuania. The majority of Technical Assistance expenditure will therefore&#13;
be disbursed during the first two years of the project.&#13;
46.              The Line-of-Credit will be disbursed by the Apex Division of BOL retrospectively&#13;
to cover 100% of eligible sub-loans made by PFIs in the first eighteen months, 85% of eligible sub-&#13;
loans in the following year, and 75 % of eligible sub-loans thereafter.&#13;
47.              Funding for the Technical Assistance programmes linked to the Project will be&#13;
made according to the contractual obligations undertaken by the multilateral and bilateral donors and&#13;
the consultants appointed.&#13;

D. Finance&#13;
48.              Credit Component. Since the PFIs will bear the responsibility of repayment of the&#13;
World Bank Line-of-Credit, sub-loans will need to be assessed upon the ability of the borrower to&#13;
repay the loan and interest.&#13;
49.             Institutional and Humtan Resource Component Lithuanian public institutions have&#13;
limited experience of cost recovery for publicly supplied services. It has been noted that whilst some&#13;
services may be justified upon public good grounds, other services directly benefit the users and if not&#13;
charged for represent a transfer from tax payers to the users. Such a practice often implies a transfer&#13;
from less to more wealthy.  Consequently, Technical Assistance programmes will encourage the&#13;
adoption of cost recovery practices.&#13;
E. Project Risks&#13;
50.              Macroeconomic Stability. Currently the International Monetary Fund is assisting&#13;
GOL in using a currency board arrangement to maintain a fixed Exchange Rate between the Lita and&#13;
the dollar.  This policy has been instrumental in the successful decrease in the rate of inflation&#13;
experienced in Lithuania.  A major risk however relates to the extent to which such sound&#13;
macroeconomic polices can be maintained for both political and economic reasons. Such uncertainty&#13;
increases borrowing risks by introducing domestic and foreign price uncertainty.&#13;
51.             Appropriate Business and Banking Skills. The other main area of risk relates to the&#13;
uncertainty of ensuring that potential investors can undertake, or have undertaken, appropriate studies&#13;
of the feasibility of investments and the ability of bank loan officers to appropriately assess the loan&#13;
applications. To the extent that a great deal of the Institutional and Human Resource Development&#13;
component of the Project is directed to improving Lithuanian capabilities in these areas this risk should&#13;
be appropriately mitigated.&#13;
F. Loan Covenants for Implementation&#13;
52.              A complete list of loan covenants to be monitored during the Project will be&#13;
included within the Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
IV. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
A. Actions to Monitor Development Objectives&#13;
53.             Individual TORs within the TA package contain clearly defined measurable&#13;
outputs. This tight definition of objectives and outputs for the TA component will simplify monitoring&#13;
of development objectives. The project indicators below are derived from the planned measurable&#13;
outputs of the TA component with additions for the credit component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
138                                                              Project Implementation Plan&#13;
54.              Baseline, mid term and end of project surveys of a constant sample of farmers will&#13;
be a central feature in monitoring and evaluating the success of this project.&#13;
55.              The project indicators will form the basis for much of the supervision plan and&#13;
particularly will be used in the one year implementation review, the mid-term review and the project&#13;
completion review. Monitoring will be strengthened by the involvement of World Bank staff and&#13;
representatives of donors.&#13;
56.              The need to fine tune or restructure the project after the mid-term review or earlier&#13;
supervision missions will be based on the following project indicators.&#13;
B. Project Indicators&#13;
57.              Although a number of indicators can be measured in absolute terms, many must be&#13;
considered in relative terms as the project proceeds.&#13;
58.              Key Physical Indicators of successful TA implementation. These are specified&#13;
in the individual TA TORs. Highlights are as follows:&#13;
Numbers trained:&#13;
farmers and others trained in basic accounts and investment feasibility;&#13;
Agricultural Company employees and managers trained in management;&#13;
individuals trained in food marketing; and&#13;
practising and potential exporters trained.&#13;
Auction established.&#13;
Farm Accounts Survey conducted annually.&#13;
Processor associations receiving detailed export support.&#13;
The production of a rural enterprise guide.&#13;
Four women's community initiatives established.&#13;
Women Farmers Trained&#13;
Auction/wholesale manuals produced.&#13;
TV/Press/Radio campaigns on rural development opportunities, co-operation,&#13;
accounting and investment, auction/wholesale principles, technical topics for&#13;
farmers.&#13;
Business seminar series for agro-industry, food processing sector.&#13;
Videos on understanding accounts, business planning, marketing, business&#13;
management&#13;
Range of written material including training manuals, workbooks and&#13;
promotional booklets.&#13;
59.              Level of improvement in farmer understanding and awareness. Measured by the&#13;
opinion survey of a constant sample sf farmers (baseline, mid-term and end of project surveys).&#13;
Improvements measured in understanding and awareness of the following:&#13;
simple credit and investment processes;&#13;
basic marketing principles;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                                                             139&#13;
*             measuring financial performance;&#13;
*             currently deficient technical skills in forage conservation, feeding principles,&#13;
housing requirements, etc.;&#13;
*             small scale business opportunities;&#13;
*             value of co-operation;&#13;
*             auctions and wholesale market principles;&#13;
role and use of banks; and&#13;
*             use of extension services.&#13;
60.              Number and quality of Lithuanian experts. This will be assessed for all fields of&#13;
Technical Assistance as outlined in the TORs including marketing, market structures, accounts,&#13;
feasibility and business planning, investment support, rural lending. This will be partly measured&#13;
through the level of Lithuanian participation in providing training, changes in education courses,&#13;
number of new business courses, perceived quality of graduates, Lithuanian expert commentary in&#13;
press and media and other local initiatives.&#13;
61.              Physical Indicators of Farm Improvement -The ongoing survey of farmer opinions,&#13;
credit line records and regular monitoring visits to farm businesses throughout Lithuania will gather&#13;
evidence for the following improvement indicators.&#13;
new/improved buildings;&#13;
drainage and other on-farm infrastructure developments;&#13;
new and second-hand machinery investments;&#13;
increases in livestock numbers on individual units;&#13;
growth in average farmed area;&#13;
improving profits;&#13;
improved attitude to security and ability to respond to change;&#13;
specialisation's since start of project; and&#13;
*             diversification's since start of project.&#13;
62.              Numbers of food processors, agricultural traders and agricultural service&#13;
companies and range of Lithuanian food products for home and export markets.&#13;
63.              Profitability and business growth. Monitored through establishment under the TA&#13;
package of the Farm Accounts Survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
140                                                                 Project Implementation Plan&#13;
64.               Credit Component Indicators.  Rate of disbursement of the credit line to the&#13;
target sector shall be measured by:&#13;
*             total amount disbursed and repaid;&#13;
*             average size of loan and size distribution;&#13;
*             proportion of funds disbursed in loans of less than $50,000;&#13;
number and percentage of total loans given which are smaller than $50,000;&#13;
and&#13;
*             the allocation of funds between on-farm credit and credit for agro and forest&#13;
industries.&#13;
65.               Failure rate' of investments supported. The presence of failures is not entirely a bad&#13;
indicator as it shows that risks are being taken. TA support and good pre-investment advice should,&#13;
however, ensure a greater proportion of successes. The type of investment which fails should also be&#13;
monitored. Loan repayment default rate will be monitored by Type of Investment, such as:&#13;
farm (private, Agricultural Company);&#13;
*             agro-processing (new, old);&#13;
farm services (new, old); and&#13;
other rural businesses.&#13;
66.               The actual rate of return achieved on investments shall also be monitored and&#13;
compared to those predicted in the feasibility studies that formed the basis of the loan applications.&#13;
&#13;

            Lithuania - Private Agriculture Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Private
            Agriculture Development Project are to assist the government
            with the development of a viable, private agriculture sector
            and to foster economic growth in rural areas by providing a
            combination of financial and technical assistance. The
            project has two main components: 1) a rural credit component
            (RCC), which includes a US $30 million line of credit and an
            institutional development program for the Agricultural Bank
            of Lithuania (ABL) and local banks; and 2) an institutional
            and human resources development component (IHDC), which
            consists of technical assistance for land reform, extension
            services, marketing, business skill training, and rural

            private small and medium enterprises in rural areas; and 6)
            provide seed money for opportunities for income and
            employment generation in rural areas. Finally, the
            objectives of the IHDC are to: 1) increase productivity,
            competitiveness, and marketing prospects for Lithuanian
            products; 2) expedite land reform and develop a mortgage
            system for increased access to credit; 3) increase the
            availability of alternative employment opportunities through
            retraining and diversification of farm businesses; 4) reduce
            rural poverty; 5) improve human skills and local
            institutional capacity; and 6) improve business management
            skills of farmers and entrepreneurs in identifying,
