I. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A.   THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
1.1   A Country Economic Report was distributed to the Board of Executive Directors on July&#13;
7, 1994. In 1993, Kazakstan adopted and began to implement a comprehensive structural reform&#13;
program aimed at moving the country towards a market economy. Although considerable&#13;
progress was made under the program in the privatization of significant segments of the economy&#13;
as well as in price and financial reforms, macroeconomic developments remained largely&#13;
determined by the behavior of inherited structures. In particular, unrestructured enterprises,&#13;
insulated from competitive or regulatory pressures for efficient performance, proved unable to&#13;
respond to liberalized market forces and continued to incur large losses and to generate large&#13;
inter-enterprise short-term indebtedness to finance these losses. Faced with the prospect of sharp&#13;
declines in production as result of the increasing insolvency of key sectors in the economy, the&#13;
Government was compelled to periodically refinance these enterprises' net working capital&#13;
requirements through monetary expansion. These refinancing operations undermined the&#13;
Government's tight monetary policies and fuelled inflation.&#13;
1.2   To remove the structural constraint on its efforts to restore stability and foster growth, the&#13;
Government launched an Anti-Crisis Program in July 1994. The program aimed at accelerating&#13;
the pace of enterprise restructuring and deepening the program of market reforms and featured&#13;
measures to: (i) speed up the privatization program; (ii) impose greater financial discipline on&#13;
banks and enterprises; (iii) remove impediments to competitive pricing arising from monopolistic&#13;
domestic market structures and restrictions on external trade; (iv) remove institutional barriers to&#13;
the exit of non-viable firms and the entry of new firms; and (v) strengthen the social safety net.&#13;
The Bank provided support to the implementation of this program with a Structural Adjustment&#13;
Loan (Ln 3900-KZ) which was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on June 8, 1995.&#13;
1.3   The energy sector is central to the process of transforming Kazakstan's economy. First,&#13;
structural reforms in the sector are a sine qua non for reform of the industrial sector. Currently,&#13;
the energy sector accounts for an estimated 32% of industrial output, 30% of industrial&#13;
employment and 8% of formal employment in the economy. The energy sector has been beset&#13;
with slumping production in the oil subsector, excess capacity and employment in the coal&#13;
subsector, deteriorating quality of service provision in the heat and power subsector and, in&#13;
general, inadequate cash generation to finance adequate levels of both maintenance expenditures&#13;
and replacement investments. In sum, the sector is being progressively de-capitalized. The&#13;
following factors have been, until recently, at the root of the sector's problems: (i) low domestic&#13;
energy prices; (ii) low prices, largely unrelated to world market levels, for exports to the&#13;
country's traditional markets; (iii) major transport constraints on the country's ability to diversify&#13;
export markets; and (iv) inadequate pressures and incentives for organizations to be commercial.&#13;
These constraints would need to be relieved if the sector is to be economically efficient and&#13;
financially viable. In addition to its direct contribution to economic activity, the sector also plays&#13;
a critical role in the country's well-developed and highly energy-intensive mining and&#13;
metallurgical subsectors. These subsectors currently account for about 50% of the country's hard&#13;
currency exports and both their economic viability and future export competitiveness depend&#13;
critically on reforms in the energy sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                1. The Energy Sector&#13;
1.4   Second, the energy sector, particularly the oil subsector, represents the country's most&#13;
promising source of exports and economic growth in the medium term. Energy exports&#13;
represented about 40% of the country's total exports in 1994. With the level of developed and&#13;
producing reserves and the current pipeline of approved foreign investments in the sector, oil&#13;
production could feasibly be doubled by 2003 from under 1% of proven reserves (17 million tons&#13;
in 1995) to close to 2% of proven reserves (40 million tons per year) and net crude oil exports&#13;
increased from 5 million tons to about 25 million per year. The implications of such an increase&#13;
in exports for the economy are enormous: oil export revenues would increase by US$2.0 billion&#13;
and incremental Government fiscal revenues would amount to around US$800 million per annum,&#13;
equivalent to about 35% of the Government's current (1995) budget. However, realizing this&#13;
potential would require stabilizing production from existing producing fields, and creating the&#13;
transport capacity to export oil production to markets with world market-related oil prices.&#13;
1.5   Finally, unlike many other sectors of the economy, the prospects for attracting foreign&#13;
investments into the energy sector and freeing domestic resources for use in other sectors are&#13;
good, provided that an appropriate framework of laws and regulations are in place and, in the&#13;
case of the subsectors with non-tradeable outputs, that macroeconomic conditions also are&#13;
favorable to the earning and repatriation of adequate returns to investors' investments.&#13;
1.6   The Government has made great progress, particularly over the last 18 months, in&#13;
formulating policies to address most of the above issues. The key policy measures already in&#13;
place and the outstanding issues for further action are enumerated in the following sections.&#13;
B.    ENERGY RESOURCES ENDOWMENT&#13;
1.7   Kazakstan has an enormous endowment of energy resources.  The country's total&#13;
recoverable reserves of oil, gas and coal are estimated at 13.0 billion tons of oil equivalent (toe)&#13;
or 722 toe per capita, ranking it among the top ten countries in the world in terms of per capita&#13;
energy resources. Coal is the dominant resource in terms of discovered recoverable reserves with&#13;
delineated reserves of about 22 billion tons, equivalent to about 10 billion tons of oil equivalent&#13;
(toe). The coal reserves are concentrated in 30 major occurrences located around the north-&#13;
eastern city of Karaganda.&#13;
1.8   Recoverable reserves of oil and gas are estimated at 2.1 billion tons (16 billion barrels)&#13;
and 1.6 trillion cubic meters (1.3 billion toe equivalent) respectively, and are concentrated in the&#13;
western part of the country around the Caspian Sea. The prospects for significant additional&#13;
discoveries of oil and gas are good. Kazakstan contains or is straddled by six major petroleum&#13;
basins, some segments of which have not been explored intensively in the past. Undiscovered&#13;
recoverable oil and gas reserves in these basins have been assessed to be at least as large as the&#13;
present level of reserves.&#13;
1.9  In addition to coal and hydrocarbon resources, the country has substantial hydropower&#13;
resources with an estimated hydropower potential of 160 trillion KWh of which about 60 trillion&#13;
KWh could be technically developed. Only about 10% of this technically feasible hydropower&#13;
resource has been developed. Aside from its base of natural resources, Kazakstan also has a well-&#13;
developed base of energy transformation industries supplying a significant proportion of the&#13;
domestic requirement for final energy resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1. The Energy Sector                                                           3&#13;
C.   DOMESTIC ENERGY DEMAND AND PRODUCTION&#13;
1.10 Total demand for primary energy in Kazakstan is estimated at 66 million toe in 1993&#13;
compared to domestic production of about 77 million toe, leaving a large net exportable surplus&#13;
of primary energy resources of about 11 million toe (Annex 1.1). The demand for final energy&#13;
amounted to about 52 million toe in 1993. However, in contrast to the surplus in primary energy&#13;
trade and reflecting the location of significant processing capacity in the neighboring countries,&#13;
trade in final energy resources resulted in a deficit of about 2 million toe.&#13;
1.11  Energy production has been characterized by large declines over recent years. Coal&#13;
production, accounting for about 60% of total primary energy production, has fallen by 23% since&#13;
1991 with much of the decline attributable to a sharp drop in export demand from Russia. Due&#13;
to structural changes in the Russian coal market, coal exports are unlikely to increase unless&#13;
alternative export markets can be found. Owing to the relatively high cost of long-distance coal&#13;
transport by rail, it is unlikely that significant and viable alternative markets for coal displaced&#13;
from the Russian market could be found. Crude oil and condensate production in 1995 had fallen&#13;
by about 23% since reaching a peak of 27 million tons in 1991, mostly as a result of increasing&#13;
backlogs in the workover of wells as a result of the straitened financial position of the oil&#13;
enterprises. Most of the decline in oil production has been absorbed by reductions in exports.&#13;
Finally, the total domestic production of petroleum products has declined by 33% since 1990 both&#13;
as a result of supply constraints arising from progressively more intermittent supplies of imported&#13;
crude oil and reduced demand.&#13;
1.12  Notwithstanding the sharp reduction in overall economic activity since 1988, domestic&#13;
energy consumption has remained stagnant. Kazakstan, like most of the countries of the FSU,&#13;
is characterized by highly intensive and inefficient use of energy. With a current gross domestic&#13;
use of primary energy of about 4400 kilograms of oil equivalent (koe) per capita, the domestic&#13;
consumption of energy is around 25% greater than that in the major economies of Western&#13;
Europe with per capita incomes about four times as great as that of Kazakstan (Annex 1. 2). The&#13;
scope for rationalizing energy use is great, and the Government, supported by a number of&#13;
bilateral agencies, has started on a comprehensive program of energy audits and conservation&#13;
promotion. Increases in the relative price of energy are an important instrument for curtailing&#13;
demand and for providing a financial incentive for conservation. However, their impact has yet&#13;
to be felt mainly because most relative energy prices have only been recently increased to a&#13;
substantial proportion of world market parity prices and the switch over of energy-intensive&#13;
industries to more efficient energy use and management demands (i) considerable financial&#13;
strictures beyond that currently imposed on major energy-using enterprises; and (ii) financial&#13;
resources not available to large energy-using enterprises.&#13;
D.   ENERGY RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT: THE REGIONAL CONTEXT&#13;
1.13  Kazakstan's energy sector was developed as an important component of a highly&#13;
integrated regional energy market spanning southern Russia and the republics of Central Asia.&#13;
In particular, the energy systems of the country are regionally distinct and more closely integrated&#13;
physically with those of neighboring countries than with each other. The integration of&#13;
Kazakstan's energy sector with that of its neighbors has resulted in a complex pattern of energy&#13;
trade under which (i) crude oil is exported from the main areas of production in western&#13;
Kazakstan to the Volga and Urals regions of Russia and imported in eastern Kazakstan from West&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                    I. The Energy Sector&#13;
Siberia; (ii) the country is a substantial importer of petroleum products although it produces&#13;
enough crude oil and has sufficient refining capacity to be self-sufficient with appropriate&#13;
investments in refinery upgrading and crude oil transport links; (iii) raw gas is exported from&#13;
western Kazakstan to Russia and processed gas is imported from Russia and Central Asia; (iv)&#13;
the country is served by three non-connected electricity grids that are integral parts of regional&#13;
power systems in Russia or Central Asia; and (v) large amounts of coal are both imported and&#13;
exported.&#13;
1.14   For much of the period since independence, the country has had to cope with two adverse&#13;
consequences of this regional legacy: (i) low export prices and uncertain costs and security of&#13;
supply of key imported energy resources; and (ii) constraints on the level of production and on&#13;
the financial performance of its energy sector as a result of market conditions in other parts of&#13;
the region. In particular, the amount of energy resources, especially oil, that the country can&#13;
export outside the FSU at higher world market parity prices is severely restricted while, within&#13;
the FSU, it has been constrained to exporting its energy resources at prices significantly lower&#13;
than the price of energy imports. For example, the country ran a substantial trade surplus with&#13;
the FSU in energy of about 1 1.0 million toe in physical terms in 1993. However, this surplus&#13;
translated into a monetary trade deficit of about US$35 million equivalent, largely as the result&#13;
of huge differentials in the prices of imports and exports.&#13;
1.15  Following many past attempts at resolving the issue of trade prices and security of energy&#13;
supplies mainly through inter-republican trade agreements, the Government's strategic focus has&#13;
shifted increasingly to: (i) creating the domestic infrastructure (crude oil pipeline and electricity&#13;
transmission lines) to achieve supply security and self-sufficiency where such investments are&#13;
demonstrably viable given the expected incidence and costs of supply disruptions; (ii) encouraging&#13;
commercial alliances between domestic and Russian oil enterprises to promote trade on mutually&#13;
beneficial terms; and (iii) developing alternative crude oil pipelines for the transport of Kazakstan&#13;
oil to seaports for export to international markets. This shift in strategy is appropriate given both&#13;
the importance of developing stable and equitable trading relations with the country's major trade&#13;
partner and the need to diversify trading options and reduce the risk of energy dependence on one&#13;
trading partner.&#13;
E.    DOMESTIC ENERGY PRICING&#13;
1.16  The Government has allowed substantial increases in energy prices since independence.&#13;
The system of administered prices for energy inherited from the Union was substantially&#13;
liberalized in March 1994 to allow both the intervals and magnitudes of price increases for all&#13;
energy supplies, except utility services to households, to be determined by producers subject to&#13;
maximum allowable margins over operating costs. Further liberalization in the system of price-&#13;
setting was introduced in November and December 1994 when, under a series of ministerial&#13;
decrees, the system of prescribed margins over costs as a basis of pricing-setting was abolished&#13;
for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products (at the ex-refinery level). Under the revised&#13;
price-setting system, the relevant energy enterprises were granted greater autonomy to set prices&#13;
subject only to prior review and approval by the Price Committee of the Anti-Monopoly&#13;
Commission. In April 1, 1995, the Government removed crude oil and petroleum product pricing&#13;
ex-refinery from the direct oversight of the Price and Anti-Monopoly Committees. In September&#13;
1995, crude oil and petroleum product prices were fully liberalized. These actions reflect the&#13;
recognition by the Government that, in cases where energy producers and suppliers do not enjoy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1. The Energy Sector                                                                 5&#13;
a natural monopoly or structural changes could be effected to introduce competition where it is&#13;
absent, the Government's involvement in price setting is both unnecessary and undesirable.&#13;
Additional measures taken in the oil industry to reinforce competitive pricing include the&#13;
elimination of export quotas on petroleum products. With respect to the power sector, electricity&#13;
prices continue to be administered. However, the Government plans to reform electricity pricing&#13;
to allow the electricity utility to generate enough profits to finance, through internal cash&#13;
generation, a pre-determined proportion of its capital expenditure and maintenance plan, subject&#13;
to review and approval of the allowable margin and the utility's cost structure by the Price and&#13;
Anti-Monopoly Committee. The Government is currently undertaking studies to determine the&#13;
options for restructuring the industry and putting in place a pricing system that would allow for&#13;
the differentiation of tariffs for different classes of consumers in order to better reflect the cost&#13;
of supply of electricity to such classes of consumers.&#13;
F.    SECTOR ORGANIZATION&#13;
1.17  Until June 1994, two ministries shared administrative responsibility for the sector along&#13;
functional lines. The Ministry of Energy and Fuel Resources (MEFR) had oversight&#13;
responsibilities for all energy producing and related activities while the Ministry of Geology&#13;
(MG) was (and continues to be) responsible for all exploration activities within the sector.&#13;
MEFR was created in early 1992 to take over the responsibilities of the former Union-wide&#13;
Ministries of Power, of Oil Industry and of Gas Industry in Kazakstan. The sector operating&#13;
entities, formerly managed by the state concerns and committees under the Union-wide Ministries,&#13;
were reorganized into ten product-based holding groups under the direct administrative control&#13;
of MEFR. Each holding group had responsibility for determining appropriate production targets&#13;
and monitoring performance, vetting investment proposals and capital expenditures, and&#13;
formulating policy for and overseeing the conduct of international trade and foreign investment&#13;
transactions. Voluntary associations of regionally-based related operating and service entities&#13;
(Production Associations) within each holding group were responsible for the (i) coordination of&#13;
operating relations between the entities; (ii) monitoring of the performance of members and the&#13;
management of reporting to the parent holding groups; (iii) provision of specialized management&#13;
and technical services to the constituent entities; (iv) international procurement, exporting and the&#13;
management of hard currency revenues; and (v) allocation of investment resources among entities.&#13;
The MG, which was a long-established republican ministry, remained responsible for the&#13;
exploration of hydrocarbons, and other fuels and minerals. In June 1994, MEFR was split into&#13;
two ministries: the Ministry of Oil and Gas (MOG) with responsibility for petroleum activities;&#13;
and the Ministry of Power and Coal with administrative oversight over coal production and power&#13;
generation, transmission and distribution.&#13;
1.18  Other Govermment agencies with significant oversight or policy roles in the sector include:&#13;
(i) the Ministry of the Environment and Bio-resources which monitors compliance with&#13;
enviromnental regulations in ongoing operations and investment plans; (ii) the State Committee&#13;
on Foreign Capital utilization in the Ministry of Finance, which vets and approves all proposed&#13;
investments with foreign financing participation; and (iii) the State Property Committee (SPC)&#13;
in which is vested the state's ownership of sector assets and control over the disposition of assets.&#13;
1.19  Since the initial post-independence reorganization of the sector to transfer supervisory&#13;
responsibilities for the sector from Moscow-based to national institutions, the Government has&#13;
made considerable progress at the policy level in clarifying the mandate of the sectoral holding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                     1. The Energy Sector&#13;
groups and starting the process of organizational reform in the sector. All the holding groups&#13;
were transformed by a series of Presidential Decrees issued in late 1993 into legally autonomous&#13;
enterprises with the exercise of ownership rights over sector enterprises under their supervision&#13;
transferred to them by SPC. The holding companies were charged with the incorporation of&#13;
entities under their control as joint-stock companies, the preparation of plans for the restructuring&#13;
of sector activities to promote efficient operations, and the formulation and implementation of&#13;
plans for the selective divestiture of part of their equity interest in sector entities to the public and&#13;
foreign strategic investors.&#13;
1.20   Progress in implementing the restructuring of the sector has been slow. Structurally, the&#13;
sector organizational arrangements inherited from the FSU have only recently started to be&#13;
substantially reformed. The sector continues to be organized largely into integrated or related&#13;
entities with multiple supervisory tiers. The demarcation of responsibilities between supervisory&#13;
tiers is unclear, obscuring responsibility for performance. Competition in the provision of goods&#13;
and services, where feasible, is limited and the existing structure promotes a strong incentive for&#13;
cross-subsidization of related entities within regional or national groups. In addition to weak&#13;
market pressures for efficient performance, an effective regulatory framework for sector&#13;
operations that are natural monopolies has only recently started to emerge.  Given this&#13;
institutional backdrop, selective but large operating subsidies to sector entities and relatively easy&#13;
access to financing for operations (mostly involuntarily extended arrears on receivables), the&#13;
predominant performance objective in the sector is still centered around the level of production,&#13;
whether its level or mix is efficient and profitable or not. At present, the sector is largely&#13;
immune from both the economic and financial pressures necessary to motivate it to perform&#13;
efficiently.&#13;
1.21   The Government fully recognizes that its strategy of effecting structural change through&#13;
the holding companies has contributed to slowing the process of structural change: the holding&#13;
groups have limited incentives to oversee radical change in the present organizational&#13;
arrangements, have no powers to effect supportive policy changes and have multiple and possibly&#13;
conflicting mandates. In the light of this, the Government has taken initiatives to breakup the&#13;
holding companies and to restructure and privatize parts of the sector using independent outside&#13;
advisors and Government agencies independent of the holding companies.&#13;
G.    ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
1.22   The production and inefficient use of energy resources has contributed immensely to the&#13;
degradation of the environment and a high incidence of avoidable occupational ailments. Energy&#13;
production and supply activities in Kazakstan are characterized by a large number of&#13;
environmentally unsound practices: (i) environmental controls are lacking or ineffectual in coal&#13;
and uranium mining; (ii) oil production involves extensive and wasteful flaring of associated gas,&#13;
widespread spillage of oil and improper disposal of produced fluids; and (iii) power generation&#13;
involves the large scale use of high-ash and low-grade coal and large volumes of ash-handling&#13;
and disposal without adequate emission control systems. In addition, the absence of financial&#13;
incentives for the efficient use of energy, and the concomitant widespread use of energy&#13;
inefficient and obsolete technologies in industry coupled with the priority given to heavy and&#13;
energy-intensive industries resulted in an energy production strategy that contributed to both the&#13;
wasteful use and accelerated depletion of key energy resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1. The Energy Sector                                                                   7&#13;
1.23   Reversing this legacy of environmental degradation would require: (i) significant&#13;
investments in remediating past and reducing future damage to the enviromnent; (ii) price reforms&#13;
to promote efficient use and production of energy resources; and (iii) the strengthening of&#13;
environmental standards and the systems for monitoring and promoting compliance with&#13;
established standards. The Government is making steady progress with respect to the latter two&#13;
issues. Progress in restructuring technological practices and remediating past environmental&#13;
damage is likely to be slow given the present constraints on resources.&#13;
H.    THE BANK'S ROLE IN THE SECTOR&#13;
1.24  The Bank's strategy in Kazakstan is to support policies and investments that promote&#13;
economic recovery and growth and social development within a stable macroeconomic&#13;
environment. The focus of the Bank's strategy is on restoration of the country's productive&#13;
capacity, improved public sector management, and strengthening of the social safety net.&#13;
1.25   The energy sector is a central element in this strategy: the efficient and secure production&#13;
and supply of energy from the huge base of discovered but undeveloped as well as developed&#13;
energy resources is critical to economic recovery and is the country's most promising source of&#13;
growth in exports revenue in the medium term.&#13;
1.26  Owing to the huge capital and foreign exchange requirements of the energy sector in&#13;
general and the petroleum subsector in particular, rational investment, taxation and pricing&#13;
policies and effective systems of corporate governance and regulation are essential to its efficient&#13;
development. Accordingly, the Bank's energy sector strategy aims at: (i) encouraging and&#13;
assisting the Government to develop an appropriate legal and institutional environment to enhance&#13;
the efficiency and cash-generating capacity of energy sector entities and attract foreign direct&#13;
investments and financing; and (ii) supporting, through lending for investments and technical&#13;
assistance, selective but critical initiatives to stem the decline in output, improve the efficiency&#13;
of operations of existing sector entities, relieve infrastructure constraints on the sector's access&#13;
to viable domestic and export markets and act as a catalyst to attract foreign investment and&#13;
promote reform in sector institutional arrangements.&#13;
1.27  The initial focus of the Bank's sector assistance strategy is the petroleum subsector. This&#13;
early emphasis reflects four factors: (i) the subsector's substantial potential for a rapid initial&#13;
increase in production; (ii) the potential for a rapid increase in exports, foreign exchange earnings&#13;
and the subsector's contribution to Government fiscal revenues; (iii) the early foreign investor&#13;
interest in the development and rehabilitation of the huge discovered resources in the subsector&#13;
and in the exploration of the country's highly promising petroleum prospects; and (iv) the need&#13;
for early attention to resolving critical domestic policy and oil transport issues to enable the&#13;
subsector's production potential to be fully realized both in the medium and long term.&#13;
1.28  The Bank's petroleum subsector strategy is being implemented through an inter-related&#13;
program of investment lending and technical assistance operations supported by elements of the&#13;
Bank's first structural adjustment operation in the country.&#13;
1.29 Investment Lending Operations. The focus of the Bank's investment operation in the&#13;
sector has been the Uzen oil field. Uzen is the largest fully-developed and producing field in&#13;
Kazakstan with remaining proven reserves of about 100 million tons or 750 million barrels (paras&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                  1. The Energy Sector&#13;
4.2 and 5.6). However, a growing and large backlog of well workover and maintenance of field&#13;
facilities that has been accumulating since 1989 has led to a sharp, premature and accelerating&#13;
rate of decline in its annual oil production from about 5% in 1988-1989 to 25% in 1994-1995&#13;
(para. 4.15). The continuation of the average rate of decline since 1989 will result in the&#13;
cessation of economic operations in the field by 2002 with about 90 million tons of oil&#13;
unrecovered. The rehabilitation of the field is potentially viable but, given the degree of&#13;
deterioration of its operating assets and facilities, will cost an estimated US$0.9 billion (para&#13;
5.5). An estimated US$0.2 to US$0.3 billion of this rehabilitation requirement will need to be&#13;
raised from external sources, assuming an efficiently managed rehabilitation program.&#13;
1.30  The key policy and institutional constraints on the viable rehabilitation of a field like Uzen&#13;
were identified during the early stages of the Bank's involvement in the sector and the&#13;
preparation of a possible package of assistance to Uzen under the Rehabilitation Loan (KZ-PA-&#13;
8509). Specific actions and programs were designed to address these constraints and were&#13;
incorporated in a Petroleum Technical Assistance (PTA) Project (Ln 3744-KZ) and the Structural&#13;
Adjustment Loan (Ln 3900-KZ) (paras 1.32 to 1.34). However, as a mature oil-producing&#13;
operation, the Uzen field faces a number of other problems in attracting the external financing&#13;
that is critical to its rehabilitation: (i) extensive environmental contamination of the field against&#13;
which no past provision for remediation has been made and for which the future liability for&#13;
remediation is unknown; (ii) an inefficient organizational structure with substantial overstaffing,&#13;
extensive internal cross-subsidization of non-viable activities, weak management and financial&#13;
controls and ambiguous commercial mandate and powers; (iii) limited availability of credible&#13;
information on the condition of wells and the producibility of the remaining oil reserves from the&#13;
existing stock of wells. In addition there is no well-organized process or experienced domestic&#13;
capacity for soliciting investment interest in established on-going oil field operations. Reflecting&#13;
these constraints, the Government's past attempts at attracting investments to the field have been&#13;
unsuccessful.&#13;
1.31   Given this background, the Bank's role in the Uzen rehabilitation program has been to&#13;
help the Government to (i) establish that the rehabilitation of the field is viable using methods&#13;
and yardsticks familiar to potential investors; (ii) design a program to assess and address the&#13;
environmental and operating problems and risks likely to confront potential investors and&#13;
Uzemnunaigas in rehabilitating the field; (iii) develop and implement a reorganization and&#13;
privatization plan to address organizational and management weaknesses within Uzenmunaigas&#13;
and provide viable corporate vehicles for potential strategic investors; (iv) put in place an&#13;
effective process for actively and effectively seeking long-term equity and operating partners for&#13;
the field; and (v) finance the initial investment requirements to rehabilitate the field and prevent&#13;
further sharp deterioration in its physical condition. The proposed Uzen Oil Field Rehabilitation&#13;
Project would finance (i) the implementation of a slice of the rehabilitation program for the field&#13;
as a whole; (ii) consulting and technical services to implement the investment program and&#13;
expand knowledge of the operating and environmental condition of the field; (iii) start on a&#13;
program to remediate past environmental damage; and (iv) training of Uzenmunaigas staff and&#13;
strengthening of management systems. Other aspects of the rehabilitation program, including the&#13;
systematic promotion of the field to outside investors and the restructuring and privatization of&#13;
Uzenmunaigas are being implemented under the Petroleum Technical Assistance Project. The&#13;
proposed Project is viewed by the Government as an important demonstration project in the&#13;
subsector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. The Energy Sector                                                              9&#13;
1.32  Technical Assistance Programs. The Bank was instrumental in assisting the Government&#13;
in 1993 to prepare a comprehensive program of technical assistance requirements in the energy&#13;
sector and in mobilizing donor financing for such a program. This assistance was undertaken in&#13;
conjunction with the Technical Cooperation Program under which the Bank initiated and&#13;
completed work on a broad range of sector policy issues covering petroleum legislation and&#13;
taxation, energy pricing and petroleum sector restructuring. The Petroleum Technical Assistance&#13;
Project (Ln 3744-KZ) was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on June 2, 1994. The&#13;
PTA Project supports initiatives to strengthen the management of the petroleum subsector and&#13;
create the conditions necessary for the effective mobilization of foreign investment resources into&#13;
the subsector. The project provides assistance to the Government and enterprises in the petroleum&#13;
subsector to: (i) appraise and structure selected investment projects, and seek foreign equity&#13;
participation in such projects; (ii) review and revamp the petroleum taxation regime; (iii) develop&#13;
and implement a restructuring, commercialization and privatization program for the sub-sector;&#13;
and (iv) rationalize and strengthen the domestic capacity for the provision of training in the&#13;
subsector in both technical and commercial areas.&#13;
1.33 Adjustment Operations. The Bank has provided support to the Government in developing&#13;
a package of price, taxation and institutional reforms in the oil sector (paras 2.11 to 2.38). This&#13;
package was adopted under the Anti-Crisis Program and was implemented by the Government&#13;
under the Bank-supported Structural Adjustment operation (Loan 3900-KZ). These reforms&#13;
resulted in the formal liberalization of crude oil and petroleum products pricing and trade, the&#13;
dissolution of Munaionimderi (the state-owned monopoly wholesale and retail distributor of&#13;
petroleum products) and the privatization of its retail distribution activities. Measures have also&#13;
been instituted to ensure open access to the storage and terminal facilities formerly owned and&#13;
operated by Munaionimderi. The drafting of a tax code for petroleum and minerals was initiated&#13;
under this operation and the Bank is providing assistance to the Government in the preparation&#13;
of the petroleum tax code under the Petroleum Technical Assistance Project.&#13;
1.34  As the initial package of support for the petroleum subsector is completed with the&#13;
proposed Uzen Oil Field Rehabilitation Project, the emphasis of Bank support in the petroleum&#13;
sector is expected to be on underpinning the subsector's ability to attract private financing for&#13;
investments. This support would be provided through both the Bank's guarantee instruments and&#13;
the selective financing of critical investment-related advisory services under the PTA Project.&#13;
The focus of the Bank's sector assistance strategy and related investment operations are expected&#13;
to shift increasingly to the power and heat subsectors. The reliability of the power subsector's&#13;
performance both in provision of power to industry and heat to the population has deteriorated&#13;
sharply in the past four years. The subsector requires both institutional reforms and investments&#13;
to ensure its continued viability as a secure supplier of electricity and heat. A dialogue was&#13;
started in 1992 with the Government and subsector holding group on critical subsectoral issues&#13;
and the Bank assisted the Government in obtaining grant-financing for the elaboration of key&#13;
investment issues. Future Bank assistance to the subsector would focus on institutional and&#13;
regulatory reforms to strengthen the incentives for efficient operations and investments, bolster&#13;
its cash generating capacity and support private foreign financing. The Bank's investment lending&#13;
would complement these reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. THE OIL SUBSECTOR&#13;
A.   OIL RESERVES AND PRODUCTION&#13;
2.1   Kazakstan's crude oil resources (para 1.7) may be characterized as four-tiered: (i) small&#13;
discovered and appraised but undeveloped or partially developed fields accounting for about 300&#13;
million tons of the country's proven and probable oil reserves; (ii) fully developed and producing&#13;
fields collectively accounting for an estimnated 700 million tons of reserves and virtually all of&#13;
the country's current oil production; (iii) two giant fields (Tengiz and Karachaganak) that have&#13;
been partially developed and account for the remainder of the country's proven and probable&#13;
reserves (1.1 billion tons); and (iv) the huge unexplored potential estimated to be at least as large&#13;
as currently exploitable reserves.&#13;
2.2   The country's known petroleum  endowment is significantly under-exploited with&#13;
production largely confined to a few fields, accounting for a relatively small proportion (33%)&#13;
of total exploitable reserves. Current (1995) oil production makes Kazakstan the second largest&#13;
producer among countries of the FSU but accounts for an unusually low proportion of proven&#13;
reserves (less than 1%) by international norms.&#13;
2.3   The low rate of exploitation of reserves reflects the historic lack of adequate technical and&#13;
financial resources to develop new fields and optimize production from developed fields. Within&#13;
the FSU, development of the petroleum subsector in Kazakstan faced significant competition for&#13;
centrally-allocated investment resources from petroleum prospects located elsewhere that were&#13;
technically less complex to exploit. At the same time, sector pricing and taxation policies and&#13;
the obligation of enterprises to fund extensive social services led to minimal internal generation&#13;
of free cash flow for reinvestment in the sector. Since the dissolution of the FSU, the sector's&#13;
financial capacity has been further eroded by (i) a prolonged period of low and controlled&#13;
domestic prices in the face of sharp increases towards world market levels in the cost of operating&#13;
and capital inputs; (ii) limited access to transport infrastructure for exports at higher prices than&#13;
those obtained within the region; and (iii) until recently, low export prices and large arrears of&#13;
payments on exports to Russia which, in the absence of transport access to the domestic refineries&#13;
and other export markets, accounts for over 40% of Kazakstan's oil production.&#13;
B.    PETROLEUM REFINING&#13;
2.4   Of the country's three refineries, Atyrau (nominal capacity of 50 million tons), in the&#13;
north Caspian Sea area, processes exclusively domestic crude and had a crude oil throughput of&#13;
4.3 million tons in 1995. Pavlodar (nominal capacity of 7.0 million tons per annum), located in&#13;
the north-eastern part of the country is wholly dependent on crude oil imports from Russia. The&#13;
refinery had a crude oil throughput of 3.0 million tons in 1995. The third refinery (nominal&#13;
capacity of 6.3 million tons), located in Chimkent in the south-eastern part of the country,&#13;
processes minor amounts of crude oil produced in the region (1.6 million tons in 1994) but is&#13;
otherwise dependent on imports of crude oil from Russia for the balance of its throughput. It&#13;
processed a total of 3.7 million tons of crude oil in 1995. The refineries are of varying vintage&#13;
and condition. The Atyrau refinery, built in 1945, is a fuel and lube oil refinery with obsolete&#13;
plant and technology. The Chimkent refinery operated as a basic hydro-skimming facility with&#13;
no installed secondary conversion units until mid- 1995. It consequently had a high yield of low-&#13;
value residual fuel oil (over 40% of output). Since then, catalytic cracking facilities have been&#13;
installed, and the yield of higher value light products should increase significantly as the facilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11                                                                 II. The Oil Subsector&#13;
are brought fully on-stream. The Pavlodar refinery is one of the most modem refineries in the&#13;
FSU with its fluidized catalytic cracking facilities.&#13;
2.5    Currently, the country's petroleum products production is dominated by a high average&#13;
yield of heavy fuel oil (40%) with relatively low output of light products (55%). The product&#13;
structure reflects the general lack of heavy oil conversion capacity and results in large imports&#13;
of diesel to meet current domestic demand and, at full operating capacity, substantial exports of&#13;
heavy fuel oil. Restrictions on crude oil imports in recent years have resulted in a precipitous&#13;
decline in capacity utilization in Pavlodar and Chimkent (from 95% in 1991 to 50% in 1995) and&#13;
heavy domestic import requirements for gasoline, diesel and heavy fuel oil.&#13;
2.6    Bulk physical distribution of petroleum products is mainly by rail with local distribution&#13;
by road. Except for a pipeline from the Chimkent refinery to Tashkent in neighboring Uzbekistan&#13;
and product pipelines from Russia serving two industrial towns in the northem part of the&#13;
country, there are no product pipelines in the country. Given the large annual uni-directional&#13;
volumes of products that are shipped from the refineries to a few distribution points, it is more&#13;
efficient technically to use pipelines for bulk physical distribution of products. Whether it is more&#13;
economic to undertake such investments depends largely on the condition and capacity of the rail&#13;
system. The economic feasibility of investments in product pipelines is proposed to be studied&#13;
under the PTA project.&#13;
2.7   The Government and the refineries have a number of plans at the moment to: (i) increase&#13;
the capacity and upgrade the product yield of the Atyrau refinery; (ii) further upgrade the&#13;
facilities of the Chimkent refinery; (iii) complete the expansion of the capacity of Pavlodar; and&#13;
(iv) construct a new refinery around Aktau to process the heavy crude with high vanadium and&#13;
other metallic content that is characteristic of a significant proportion of oil production in the&#13;
Mangyshlak region. However, the technical, economic and commercial viability of these&#13;
proposed capacity rehabilitation and expansion plans need to be demonstrated. Prima facie, some&#13;
of these investment proposals do not appear to be viable given domestic market demand and its&#13;
regional distribution, export opportunities, transport costs of refined products and the net export&#13;
value of crude oil. The Government has indicated its intention to use funds provided under the&#13;
PTA loan to review the economic and commercial feasibility of selected major refinery&#13;
investment proposals and prepare financing packages for projects demonstrated to be viable.&#13;
C.    FOREIGN INVESTMENT&#13;
2.8   The Government has given early and favorable attention to attracting foreign investment&#13;
in the sector and its promotional efforts have had a large measure of success. To date, more than&#13;
32 oil and condensate fields with estimated total proven reserves of 1.5 billion tons of oil&#13;
equivalent and 1.3 trillion cubic meters of gas (accounting for about 75% of the country's total&#13;
remaining recoverable petroleum reserves) have been put on offer by the Government and its&#13;
sector agencies to potential investors for participation in their development and rehabilitation.&#13;
About 50% of the oil reserves and virtually all of the gas reserves in the fields put on offer so&#13;
far have been accounted for by the Tengiz field and the Karachaganak field, respectively. For&#13;
the Tengiz field, a final agreement providing for a 50/50 joint venture was signed between&#13;
Tengizneftegaz (the Kazakstan production association) and a subsidiary of Chevron in April,&#13;
1993. British Petroleum, Agip and Gasprom of Russia negotiated an interim agreement for the&#13;
development of the Karachaganak field (15% of total estimated reserves offered for participation)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11. The Oil Subsector                                                               12&#13;
in early 1995. Under this agreement, the field's production would be restored to its 1991 levels&#13;
within a four-year period during which the partners have an option to enter into a production-&#13;
sharing agreement with the Government for the full-scale development of the field. The&#13;
remaining oil fields offered for participation are small. Foreign operators, mainly smaller&#13;
independent oil companies and service contractors, have expressed a good measure of interest in&#13;
these smaller operations as well.&#13;
2.9   Foreign investment agreements in discovered fields entered into or pending approval by&#13;
the Government now cover about 18 fields with total proven oil reserves of about 1.2 billion tons.&#13;
2.10  In addition to the promotion of discovered fields, the Government has also been actively&#13;
seeking foreign participation in petroleum exploration, particularly in the highly prospective peri-&#13;
Caspian basin and the Caspian sea-shelf. The Government has also been actively seeking foreign&#13;
investment and equity participation in the refinery sector.&#13;
D.    SUBSECTOR ISSUES&#13;
2.11   While external interest in exploration, development and rehabilitation prospects in the&#13;
petroleum sector of Kazakstan has been high, there have been considerable delays in concluding&#13;
agreements with potential investors and gaining Government approval for negotiated contracts.&#13;
Delays in the flow of external financing once agreements have been concluded have also been&#13;
substantial. The main factors behind these delays have been: (i) the absence, until recently, of&#13;
a coherent petroleum legal and contractual framework for petroleum operations; (ii) the lack of&#13;
a clear taxation regime for petroleum operations, particularly provisions for taxation of potential&#13;
profits in excess of adequate rates of return to investment in sector operations; (iii) the relative&#13;
complexity of participation terms and structures offered by potential investors compared to the&#13;
limited but growing domestic capacity and experience in evaluating and approving investment&#13;
proposals; and (iv) uncertainties about potential access to transport facilities for export of crude&#13;
oil and natural gas to international markets. The Government has made considerable progress&#13;
in addressing these obstacles to the timely flow of foreign investment. However, further actions&#13;
still remain to be taken by the Government to ensure that the country can continue to attract&#13;
foreign investment, facilitate the implementation of investmnent agreements and regenerate the&#13;
performance of the domestic enterprises which will be the mainstay of production in the short&#13;
to medium term.&#13;
E.    OIL PRICING&#13;
2.12  Oil pricing policy in Kazakstan has been strongly influenced by the constraints on the oil&#13;
sector's access to markets. In the immediate post-independence period, the Government's&#13;
domestic crude oil pricing policy was to maintain parity with Russian crude oil prices, albeit with&#13;
a lag, within the framework of inter-republican trade agreements. This explicit linkage of&#13;
domestic crude oil prices to the Russian domestic price was abandoned as a result of increasing&#13;
divergences in the value of the Russian and external rouble which culminated in the introduction&#13;
of a national currency in November 1993. Upon the introduction of the new national currency,&#13;
the domestic crude oil price was set by the Government at Tenge 100 per ton (US$25 per ton&#13;
equivalent at the then ruling exchange rate), then equivalent to about 50% of the Russian&#13;
domestic price and 25% of international export parity levels. The price was maintained at this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13                                                                 11. The Oil Subsector&#13;
level until March 1994 (para 1.16), by which time it had been eroded to about 5% of&#13;
international export parity levels and about 15% of the Russian domestic oil price.&#13;
2.13  In March 1994, the Government revised the system for price-setting in the oil sector and&#13;
increased average crude oil prices to Tenge 751 (US$31 equivalent) per ton, equal to Russian&#13;
import parity prices and about 40% of international export parity levels. However, reflecting the&#13;
monopsonist powers of the Russian refineries, oil export prices to Russia, while notionally set&#13;
under inter-republican trade agreements at import prices from Russia, were subject to substantial&#13;
discounting by Russian refineries. As a result, notwithstanding domestic oil pricing on an import&#13;
parity basis, the weighted average price of Kazakstan crude oil sales fell substantially short of&#13;
Russian domestic prices.&#13;
2.14   Since mid-1994, the Government and the domestic oil industry have taken a number of&#13;
actions to bring the effective price for crude oil sales in the domestic and regional market in line&#13;
with the netback from sales to international markets.&#13;
2.15  In the domestic market, the Government has introduced two key measures that are&#13;
designed to permit the oil producing entities to effectively integrate their operations forward and&#13;
capture a larger share of the margin between crude oil production costs and light petroleum&#13;
product retail prices (which, excluding taxes, are broadly comparable to international import&#13;
parity levels). First, from January 1, 1995, the Government has granted the oil producing&#13;
companies autonomy to market their crude oil in the domestic and regional market through&#13;
channels chosen by themselves rather than through the sector holding company under which all&#13;
of the country's producing and refining enterprises are grouped. Second, the monopoly on&#13;
wholesale petroleum products procurement and distribution enjoyed by the state distribution&#13;
holding company has been progressively eroded through the growing advent of toll-processing&#13;
by third parties, the grant of powers to the refineries to cease shipments for non-payment on&#13;
sales, the progressive breakup of the holding group's distribution operations and assets and its&#13;
eventual formal dissolution in April 1995. These measures have made it possible for the oil&#13;
producers to toll-process crude oil domestically and to market petroleum products in the domestic&#13;
market through an emerging network of wholesale petroleum products distributors or direct sales.&#13;
Based on the current ex-refinery petroleum product prices, the product yield of the refineries,&#13;
transport costs and the toll-processing fees negotiated between the oil producing entities and the&#13;
refineries, the net value (after VAT but excluding sales expenses) of locally toll-processed crude&#13;
oil varies from around US$40 per ton (US$5.5 per bbl) at Atyrau to US$77 per ton (US$10.5 per&#13;
bbl) at Pavlodar. These net values are equivalent to between 43% and 83% of the international&#13;
export parity price of crude oil before export taxes and between 63% and 120% after export duty&#13;
imposed on crude oil exports made by domestic oil enterprises. These net values have set a&#13;
substantially higher benchmark for the pricing of crude oil in domestic trade than the previous&#13;
anchor to Russian domestic crude oil prices.&#13;
2.16   With respect to oil trade with Russia, continuing consolidation in the Russian oil industry&#13;
in combination with the above changes in oil marketing arrangements in Kazakstan have greatly&#13;
increased the incentive for trade between oil enterprises on either side of the border on mutually&#13;
advantageous terms. As the Russian oil industry has become more vertically integrated and&#13;
geographically consolidated and the Kazakstan oil producers have increasingly been able to enjoy&#13;
the benefits of vertical integration through toll-processing, the incentives for swap arrangements&#13;
(Russian delivery of oil to the refineries in eastern Kazakstan in exchange for delivery of oil from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11. The Oil Subsector                                                               14&#13;
Kazakstan at refineries in the Urals and Volga regions of Russia) and closer commercial ties have&#13;
increased considerably. Formal swap agreements covered about 40% of Kazakstan's 1995 oil&#13;
production of 17 million tons, although actual perfonnance on the swap agreements was uneven.&#13;
F.    OIL TRANSPORT&#13;
2.17  The lack of assured access to export markets outside of the FSU has been one of the&#13;
major obstacles to significant investment and expansion in oil production. Kazakstan has an&#13;
extensive network of crude oil pipelines, mostly in the western part of the country (Annex 2. 1).&#13;
The pipeline network is fully integrated with the pipeline network in the Volga region of Russia&#13;
through which the country has its only pipeline access to markets outside the FSU. The effective&#13;
capacity of the pipeline links between the country's oil producing regions and the Russian oil&#13;
transport system is currently about 16 million tons per annum. Internally, aside from the links&#13;
between the refinery and oil fields in the western part of the country, the only pipeline link&#13;
between oil fields and refineries is in the central part of the country. In this region, relatively&#13;
small oil fields around Kumkol are connected to the trunk pipeline from West Siberia to the&#13;
South of Kazakstan and Central Asia.&#13;
2.18  The total oil transport capacity to all accessible markets is currently estimated at about 26&#13;
million tons. The headroom for additional production over the level of production in 1995 is 9&#13;
million tons. However, the transport reliability on the available routes is low and the estimated&#13;
headroom may be subject to sizeable periodic reduction. In particular, export quotas through&#13;
Russia and the allowable throughout on the pipeline between Atyrau and Samara have been&#13;
subject to periodic and unpredictable reductions. Without expanded domestic and export pipeline&#13;
capacity and increased exports to the Caspian Sea region, Kazakstan's crude oil production&#13;
potential would be capped at about 26 million tons per annum and be subject to a considerable&#13;
degree of transport-induced volatility. The composition of the country's oil transport capacity&#13;
and access to markets is detailed in Annex 2.2.&#13;
2.19  Government actions to relieve the transport constraint on the country's oil production have&#13;
centered on two key activities. First, the Government has been supporting the efforts of a&#13;
consortium comprising Russia, Oman and Kazakstan in promoting the development of a pipeline&#13;
from Kazakstan through Stavropol in Russia to the Black Sea port of Novorissysk. The proposed&#13;
pipeline has a planned ultimate capacity of 35 million tons per annum, sufficient to accommodate&#13;
the projected export throughput from all discovered but undeveloped or partially developed oil&#13;
fields in the country up to 2010. The estimated external financing requirement of the proposed&#13;
pipeline is around US$1.3 billion. The consortium was formed in 1992. It initially encountered&#13;
significant problems in attracting equity and debt financing from potential users (oil companies&#13;
with significant proposed investments in Kazakstan) and financial institutions. Two main reasons&#13;
accounted for this lack of success in raising financing: (i) a strong perception that the&#13;
shareholding structure was inequitable to new investors; while (ii) the proposed tariffs for use of&#13;
the system unduly leveraged the potential return to the shareholders at the expense of the profits&#13;
of the users. In the light of the market reception to its search for financing, the consortium, in&#13;
1995, restructured the project into two phases with the first phase concentrating on developing&#13;
terminal facilities close to Novorissysk and de-bottlenecking segments of the oil pipeline network&#13;
in Russia to allow incremental oil exports of 11 million tons. About 4.0 million tons of this&#13;
amount was earmarked for Kazakstan.  This restructuring reduced the initial financing&#13;
requirements but did not increase the interest of investors in the project. In March 1996, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15                                                              II. The Oil Subsector&#13;
capital and organizational structure of the proposed venture was also restructured.  This&#13;
restructuring was formally ratified by the participating states in April 1996. By addressing the&#13;
fundamental reason for the lack of outside interest in participating in the pipeline project, this&#13;
latest restructuring has improved substantially the prospects for raising financing for the project.&#13;
2.20  Despite the uncertainties and delays in developing an export pipeline, foreign oil&#13;
companies have continued to be keenly interested in acquiring rights (licenses) to explore for and&#13;
to develop oil reserves in Kazakstan but without assuming any obligation to invest substantial&#13;
amounts to produce the reserves. These rights (or options) to develop reserves can be valuable&#13;
as long as there are reasonable prospects for the ultimate development of an export pipeline and&#13;
the profitable development of such reserves in the future. Given the recent positive developments&#13;
on the export pipeline, the risk that companies will not exercise their options to undertake&#13;
investment to fully develop fields now appears to be low. There are however other remaining&#13;
areas of uncertainty to be resolved, including the concerns of the Government of Turkey about&#13;
the safety and environmental implications of increasing oil tanker transport through the Bosphorus&#13;
and Dardanelles.&#13;
2.21  Second, the Government has been considering the development of a crude oil pipeline to&#13;
link the oil fields in the west of the country and the refineries in the east of the country. The&#13;
development of this link would entail construction of a pipeline between the western oil fields&#13;
and Kumkol and expansion of the capacity of the pipeline between Kumkol and the trunk pipeline&#13;
from Russia to Central Asia. The estimated cost of this proposed investment is about US$900&#13;
million. A technical feasibility study of the project has already been undertaken. The economic&#13;
costs associated with the proposed pipeline at likely throughput levels are substantially higher&#13;
than those incurred under the existing oil procurement and transport arrangements. For the&#13;
proposed investment to be economically viable, these higher economic costs of transport would&#13;
have to be offset by: (i) a high probability and frequency of disruptions of the existing oil import&#13;
arrangements and with substantial economic costs associated with these supply disruptions; and&#13;
(ii) a high probability that future oil supplies from Russia would be significantly lower than the&#13;
requirements of the refineries; and that such shortfalls can be met at lower economic costs by&#13;
diversion and transport of oil from the country's western oil fields rather than through the import&#13;
of petroleum products. A comprehensive economic evaluation of the proposed investment, based&#13;
on a full assessment and simulation of the risks of disruption and shortfalls in the supply of crude&#13;
oil faced without the project, is currently being undertaken by the Government with financing&#13;
under the Petroleum Technical Assistance Project.&#13;
G.   ORGANIZATION OF THE SUBSECTOR&#13;
2.22  The petroleum subsector is organized by functional specialization under the administrative&#13;
oversight of the MOG and MG. Oil and gas production, transmission and distribution fall under&#13;
the MOG, while petroleum exploration is under the MG. The oil and gas production and related&#13;
activities are further organized by commodity specialization into two main groups. Oil production,&#13;
refining and transportation are managed mostly by functionally-based regional Associations. Up&#13;
to early 1995, these Associations were closely controlled by Munaigas, the holding company for&#13;
this segment of the petroleum industry. Seven regional oil production associations, each consisting&#13;
of oil producing and related operating and service organizations, account for all of the country's&#13;
current oil production. Similarly, all crude oil transport within the country is undertaken by four&#13;
regionally-based pipeline associations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11. The Oil Subsector                                                               16&#13;
2.23   Gas production and transmission are grouped under a holding entity, Kazakhgas. At&#13;
present, Kazakhgas' portfolio is dominated by the Karachaganak field and the transit gas&#13;
transmission line from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to Russia.&#13;
2.24  In the MG, petroleum exploration activities are managed by regionally-based exploration&#13;
drilling and geophysical entities grouped into associations along functional lines. The activities&#13;
of these entities are financed through budgetary appropriations from the geologic fund which is&#13;
derived from taxes on the revenues of oil producing entities.&#13;
2.25  In addition to these three main commodity and functional groupings, regionally-organized&#13;
petroleum product bulk transport, storage and retail distribution activities were managed, until&#13;
April 1995, within the public sector under the holding company Munaionimderi. Natural gas&#13;
distribution operations are managed by regionally-based distribution companies.&#13;
2.26  In 1993, the Government adopted a three-phased strategy for organizational reform in the&#13;
subsector based on its generic strategy for enterprise reform in the economy. First, the existing&#13;
subsector enterprises were to be corporatized under the supervision of the holding groups.&#13;
Second, the corporatized entities were to be restructured to promote competition and, where&#13;
relevant, a framework for the regulation of natural monopolies developed. Third, selected&#13;
enterprises were to be privatized.&#13;
2.27  The results of organizational reform in the subsector have been mixed. Most of the&#13;
commercial enterprises in the subsector have been incorporated as joint-stock companies.&#13;
However, virtually all the companies have been incorporated as closed joint-stock companies&#13;
(90% equity ownership by the state and 10% by the management and workforce) with few&#13;
changes in enterprise objectives and management. On restructuring, the Government has been&#13;
faced with three broad options: (i) the break-up of the subsector into competing independent&#13;
corporate units, both upstream and downstream; (ii) the preservation of the vertically-integrated&#13;
inherited industry structure but with restructured internal organizational arrangements to promote&#13;
efficient performance coupled with divestiture of selected operating activities; or (iii) the break-up&#13;
of the inherited industry structure into a small number of competing vertically-integrated entities&#13;
with common pipeline and other facilities spun-off into separate regulated common-carrier or&#13;
service entities. However, a consensus in the Government on a preferred option for restructuring&#13;
has been slow to emerge reflecting deep divisions on the appropriate balance between&#13;
fragmentation of the subsector to promote competition and the promotion of a single or a cluster&#13;
of large integrated national oil companies, private or publicly-owned.&#13;
2.28  Notwithstanding the absence of a consensus on the ultimate structure of the subsector, the&#13;
Government has made steady progress in dealing with some of the demonstrably unsatisfactory&#13;
aspects of the subsector's performance arising from its inherited structure: (i) the degree of&#13;
control exercised by Munaigas over oil producing enterprises has been reduced considerably to&#13;
allow these enterprises greater autonomy in making commercial decisions; (ii) Munaionimderi has&#13;
been dissolved and a significant proportion of the petroleum products retail distribution businesses&#13;
have been privatized; the bulk storage and related transport assets of Munaionimderi -- the main&#13;
source of monopoly power in this industry segment -- are undergoing privatization and a&#13;
regulatory system is currently being developed to foster adequate access to such facilities by&#13;
distributors; (iii) a start has been made in rationalizing the internal organizational arrangements&#13;
in the Production Associations to promote efficient management; this process has resulted so far&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17                                                                   II. The Oil Subsector&#13;
in the separation of one major oil producing enterprise (Uzenneft) from its parent PA; (iv) the&#13;
wholesale market for gas has been liberalized with non-discriminatory access by third parties to&#13;
the transmission network operated by Kazakgas.&#13;
2.29   On privatization, the underlying private sector participation in the upstream oil industry&#13;
is significant and is likely to grow substantially in the future: (i) existing joint-venture agreements&#13;
cover about 40% of discovered reserves; (ii) the Government has started to selectively divest of&#13;
parts of its equity interest in joint-venture organizations to foreign oil companies; and (iii) foreign&#13;
oil company participation in exploration is substantial. However, much of this private sector&#13;
involvement reflects direct interest in reserves separated from enterprises rather than in existing&#13;
enterprises. Progress on the privatization of existing enterprises has been limited to date to the&#13;
sale of petroleum product and liquified petroleum gas distribution activities and companies,&#13;
conducted under the Government's small scale and mass privatization program. Larger operating&#13;
units and entities were planned to be selectively privatized on a case-by-case basis, principally&#13;
through attracting strategic foreign equity investors. This process started slowly but is now&#13;
proceeding at a fast pace. In early 1994, the Government contracted the services of several&#13;
investment advisors to prepare proposals for the sale by international tender of equity interests&#13;
in two small oil-producing PAs with extensive undeveloped reserves and in the Chimkent&#13;
refinery. The investment solicitation documents for these activities were completed recently and&#13;
the Government has started approaching potential strategic investors.&#13;
2.30   To date, relatively little attention has been devoted to addressing: (a) the privatization or&#13;
disposition of enterprises and assets in which foreign investment interest is likely to be limited;&#13;
and (b) the participation of the Kazakstan public in the privatization of the sector outside of small&#13;
scale distribution activities. However, the Government's objective now is to broaden domestic&#13;
private sector participation in the sector through: (i) further divestment of its stake in enterprises&#13;
with strategic foreign partners; (ii) the restructuring and privatization of the operations and assets&#13;
of enterprises in which there is no immediate foreign investor interest; and (iii) the privatization&#13;
of the residual operating activities and assets of enterprises with foreign strategic partners in&#13;
selected activities. This enhanced approach will be adopted in the proposed project. Specifically,&#13;
the Government has incorporated Uzenmunaigas as an open joint-stock company and plans to&#13;
privatize it through (a) the divestment of part of the state's equity holding to the public; (b) the&#13;
attraction of outside firms as strategic investors in specific operating units; and (c) the separation,&#13;
incorporation and privatization of some operating units.&#13;
H.    THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR OIL OPERATIONS&#13;
2.31   A Petroleum Law (PL) was approved by the legislature on first reading in November,&#13;
1994 and passed by Presidential Decree on June 28, 1995. The passage of the PL completes the&#13;
basic package of legislative measures governing investments and operations in the oil sector. The&#13;
other complementary legislation include: (i) the Law on the Subsoil which vests ownership of all&#13;
subsoil resources in the state, provides for the distribution of licensing powers for exploitation&#13;
of the subsoil between the central and local governments, designates the institutions responsible&#13;
for managing significant aspects of the licensing process, and lays the basis for the levy of fees&#13;
for the use of natural resources; (ii) the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers on Procedures for&#13;
Licensing of the Subsoil (August 8, 1994); (iii) the Foreign Investment Law (December 1994)&#13;
which specifies the basis on which government financial guarantees are to be provided and&#13;
provides for (a) the stabilization of the legal regime in existence at the inception of an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11. The Oil Subsector                                                             18&#13;
investment; (b) guarantees against expropriation in line with international standards; (c)&#13;
guarantees of investors' ability to repatriate hard currency earnings; and (d) dispute resolution&#13;
procedures under investment contracts; and (iv) the Decree on Taxes and Obligatory Payments&#13;
to fhe Budget (General Tax Code) (April 25, 1995) which defines, inter-alia, the framework for&#13;
the taxation of petroleum operations. Kazakstan is the first state of the FSU to have completed&#13;
the basic package of petroleum legislation.&#13;
2.32  The PL provides for petroleum operations to be conducted through production sharing&#13;
agreements, concession contracts or risk service contracts and addresses adequately the substantive&#13;
issues likely to affect the efficient development of the petroleum sector. The provisions of the&#13;
PL take precedence over any conflicting provision on petroleum matters in other existing&#13;
legislation and provide for the grand-fathering of all provisions within contracts entered into prior&#13;
to its passage. Some important issues remain unresolved under the PL but their proposed&#13;
treatment under other existing or pending arrangements are satisfactory. In particular, the agency&#13;
to be vested with powers to implement the Government's policy in the subsector is not specified&#13;
in the PL, reflecting the absence of consensus during the development of the law on an agency&#13;
to perform this role on a permanent basis. However, the powers of such a body are clearly&#13;
defined and the institutional arrangements presently in place for the administration of the law are&#13;
satisfactory. The PL provides the framework for the taxation of petroleum operations, including&#13;
adequate guarantees on the stability of fiscal arrangements over the duration of negotiated&#13;
contracts. Finally, the PL does not specify the regulations to govern petroleum operations but&#13;
grants authority to the Government to develop appropriate regulations. This arrangement gives&#13;
flexibility to the Government to introduce rules for petroleum operations as necessary. However,&#13;
such rules might require legislative approval to come into force and this could seriously&#13;
compromise the Government's responsiveness to changing industry circumstances.  The&#13;
Government is currently in the process of developing model contracts to guide the negotiation&#13;
of agreements under the PL. A work program for the development of regulations is also under&#13;
implementation. The Government, using resources available under the PTA project and form&#13;
bilateral agencies, has started to address the problem of strengthening its capacity to administer&#13;
both the contracts already in force and future licenses and agreements.&#13;
I.    THE TAXATION FRAMEWORK FOR OIL OPERATIONS&#13;
2.33  Recently issued Presidential Decrees on a PL and "On Taxes and Other Obligatory&#13;
Payments to the Budget" have introduced a coherent framework for the taxation of petroleum&#13;
operations. First, all petroleum operations are to be subject to the provisions of the general&#13;
income tax regime covering the treatment of profits, interest payments and distribution of profits,&#13;
losses, revenues and expenses (including depreciation). Second, petroleum operations are to be&#13;
subject to specified special taxes and payments -- bonuses, royalties, and additional profits taxes -&#13;
-- to be imposed at rates to be negotiated in individual contracts. Third, petroleum operations&#13;
may be subject to other taxes to be negotiated and defined in individual contracts.&#13;
2.34  The general income tax code provides for: (i) profits tax at a rate of 30%; (ii) depreciation&#13;
of physical assets and exploration and intangible costs at rates specified in the General Tax Code;&#13;
(iii) loss carry-forward for five years; (iv) VAT at a gross rate of 20% on domestic sales and&#13;
imported material; and (v) withholding taxes on interest and dividends of 15%. VAT on inputs&#13;
in excess of VAT on sales for any monthly reporting period is reimbursable by the Tax&#13;
Inspectorate, eliminating the additional tax burden that can arise where domestic sales are a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19                                                                   11. The Oil Subsector&#13;
relatively small proportion of total sales, as is likely to be the case for foreign oil investors in&#13;
Kazakstan. The depreciation schedules in the General Tax Code are in general longer than those&#13;
available in other capital-seeking oil producing regions and thus provide less competitive tax&#13;
shields and investment incentives. The bases for assessment of additional profits taxes and&#13;
royalties have yet to be defined. Hitherto, the bases for assessment of additional profits taxes&#13;
have varied widely from contract to contract contributing to the complexity of negotiations of&#13;
individual contracts and subsequent tax administration.&#13;
2.35 The Government's strategy for tax reform includes the development of specific subsidiary&#13;
chapters of the General Tax Code to cover detailed provisions for the taxation of petroleum and&#13;
mineral mining operations. The subsidiary chapter on petroleum operations is expected to cover&#13;
the detailed accounting rules for the computation of taxable income, and the basic features of an&#13;
additional profits tax and royalty regime and the methodology to be used in defining excess&#13;
profits subject to additional income tax. Preliminary work undertaken by the Ministry of Finance&#13;
indicates that: (i) a preferred additional profits tax regime is the "discounted cashflow trigger" tax&#13;
under which cashflow generated over and above a threshold rate of return would be subject to&#13;
an additional income tax; and (ii) a royalty regime is likely to be structured on a sliding scale&#13;
with progressively higher marginal rates of royalty on increasing production levels but with the&#13;
overall average rate of royalty restricted to a modest level. However, specific choices are&#13;
expected to be made only after a thorough assessment of available options.&#13;
2.36   The proposed petroleum tax reforms are broadly consistent with the principles embodied&#13;
in negotiated fiscal arrangements for joint ventures. In contrast, domestic oil operations have&#13;
hitherto been subject to: (i) a tax on revenues (8%) to finance the exploration activities of MG-&#13;
related entities; joint-ventures with foreign participation have generally been exempted from this&#13;
tax; and (ii) fixed rental payment. There is no longer an institutional link between the MG&#13;
enterprises and the PAs and thus no longer a rationale for the geological fund. Also, its&#13;
economic rationale is weak: since the levy pays no regard to the underlying profitability of field&#13;
operations, it can adversely affect the financial performance of otherwise economically viable&#13;
fields. This effect would be resolved by a royalty regime better tailored to production levels and&#13;
cost structures of domestically-managed oil fields. Rental payments were introduced in December&#13;
1991 to reduce enterprise net profit margins to no more than two-times the industry average and&#13;
were earmarked for the financing of urban transport services. Although eligibility to pay was&#13;
determined by profitability, the tax was imposed as a fixed sum per ton of sales. The rationale&#13;
and administration of the tax was subsequently undermined by inflation in input prices and its&#13;
impact on both the appropriate yardstick for determining adequate profitability and the solvency&#13;
of enterprises to pay assessed rentals. By mid-1993, rental payment levels had been modified&#13;
four times and had become applicable to only two PAs. At present, the payment is applied as&#13;
a negotiated royalty on revenues.&#13;
2.37  In addition to the geological levy and rental payments, domestic enterprises are subject&#13;
to export duties on oil exports. Foreign oil operations are exempt from this duty. At the&#13;
prevailing rate of ECU 23 per ton, the duty can serve as a relatively severe disincentive to&#13;
domestic oil enterprises. In practice, due to external restrictions on exports, prior allocation of&#13;
available export capacity mostly to foreign joint-ventures and liberalized domestic oil prices, the&#13;
distortionary effects of the duty are limited. In principle, however, the discriminatory application&#13;
of the duty could distort investment decisions by making certain forms of investment potentially&#13;
unattractive to domestic enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. The Oil Subsector                                                               20&#13;
2.38  The Government's objective is to integrate the tax treatment of domestic enterprises fully&#13;
into the proposed frarnework but special regard would need to be paid to the appropriate&#13;
application of an additional profits tax to income from flowing production arising from historic&#13;
investments made by the domestic enterprises. In these cases it may be appropriate and&#13;
administratively expedient, for example, to assume that more than the threshold return has already&#13;
been earned and taxes on income be applied at the highest marginal rate. The available options&#13;
and desirable treatment will be reviewed during the drafting of the petroleum tax code.&#13;
2.39  Based on the current tax structure, the Government's prospective take from wholly&#13;
domestically-owned oil producing enterprises is potentially high. However, the actual take has&#13;
been relatively low, reflecting largely the current low proportion of revenues subject to the export&#13;
tax and the widespread non-imposition of the rental payment. The Government's negotiated share&#13;
of the present value of the net cash flow from the activities of existing foreign operators is&#13;
reasonable since most agreements incorporate relatively modest income tax rates (based on&#13;
business income tax rate extant) and royalties, with additional taxes and royalties based on&#13;
profitability and production levels. From a sample of recent agreements, the present value of the&#13;
Government's total negotiated take over the life of the projects represents between 45 and 55%&#13;
of the expected present value of the projects' net cash flow.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. THE LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE&#13;
3.1   Since 1980, the Bank has approved about 106 loans and credits in the petroleum&#13;
subsector for a total of about US$7 billion to about 56 countries. The loans cover most&#13;
petroleum subsectors but with the largest number of loans in petroleum exploration promotion&#13;
activities. About 90 project completion reports (PCR) have been prepared covering both&#13;
technical assistance and investment operations. The PCRs indicate that most projects achieved&#13;
their objectives, both institutional and production. In particular, most Bank projects in the&#13;
subsector were relatively successful in training local staff and transferring modem petroleum&#13;
operating practices. However, a recurring theme in most projects is a significant lag in&#13;
implementation schedules. Most of these slippages reflect the borrowers' initial unfamiliarity&#13;
with Bank procurement procedures, fragmentation of responsibilities among subsector agencies&#13;
and cumbersome internal clearance procedures between subsector agencies and entities.&#13;
3.2   OED studies of the Bank's lending experience in the subsector suggest that investment&#13;
projects have been relatively unsuccessful vehicles for promoting subsector policy reforms.&#13;
Rather, most of the Bank's success in policy reform has risen from policy-based lending&#13;
operations, for example, in Bangladesh, Egypt and Pakistan. Similarly, progress in changing&#13;
subsector organizational arrangements and management practices through Bank investment&#13;
operations have tended to be limited owing to the Bank's generally ambitious reform programs&#13;
and strong vested interests against significant organizational changes.&#13;
3.3   Arising from its initial lending experience in petroleum promotion and investment&#13;
operations, the Bank has developed a set of guidelines governing lending operations in the&#13;
subsector. The guidelines cover both subsector and project specific conditions designed to&#13;
ensure effective perfomnance of subsector operations and the creation of a climate conducive to&#13;
attracting and generating investment resources for the subsector.  The general subsector&#13;
conditions cover: (i) prices: prices should be set to ensure efficient use of energy and to provide&#13;
incentives for exploration, development and production of petroleum resources; (ii) taxation:&#13;
the level of taxation should be set both to grant the government a reasonable share of any&#13;
possible rent from petroleum operations and to ensure an adequate level of profitability for the&#13;
enterprises; (iii) legalframework: a clear and transparent legal and contractual framework to&#13;
assure enterprises and potential private investors of a stable basis for their operations should be&#13;
in place; and (iv) role of government and enterprises: enterprises should be given autonomy to&#13;
undertake their operations on a commercial basis subject to accountability for their performance&#13;
while governments should focus on developing subsector policy and overseeing the efficient&#13;
operation of the subsector through its policy and regulatory instruments.&#13;
3.4   Project-specific conditions cover the need for sound internal management procedures to&#13;
ensure adequate returns to investments through efficient procurement procedures, effective&#13;
financial accounting and management practices, adequate capital budgeting procedures and sound&#13;
operating practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                                      III. The Lessons of Experience&#13;
3.5   The preparation and design of the project take full account of these lessons of the Bank's&#13;
lending experience in the subsector. Specifically, significant reforms in the petroleum subsector&#13;
pricing, taxation and organizational structure have been agreed upon or implemented already&#13;
under the Bank's first Structural Adjustment Operations (FY95). Also, implied strategies for&#13;
effective project design reflected in the Bank's experience have been fully incorporated in the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
3.6   The proposed project is the first Bank investment operation in Kazakstan's energy sector.&#13;
However, recent experience in processing and implementing the Petroleum Technical Assistance&#13;
project and in processing the ultimately abortive (at the Government's request) Uzen Oil Field&#13;
component of the Rehabilitation Loan (FY94) has confirmed substantial weaknesses in&#13;
procurement and project management capacity in general in the proposed project entity. More&#13;
specifically, there is very limited familiarity with Bank procedures and a substantial risk of&#13;
project implementation delays. The project implementation arrangements proposed under the&#13;
project have been designed to overcome these weaknesses. Other important lessons learnt from&#13;
the processing and implementation of these projects include the following: (a) the importance&#13;
of early identification of all agencies and enterprises that are critical to the success of a project&#13;
and the need to pay particular attention to promoting early ownership and a co-ordinated&#13;
approach to the project amongst such stakeholders; and (b) the importance of promoting the&#13;
substantial involvement of local experts in the management and execution of a project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. THE BENEFICIARY: UZENMUNAIGAS&#13;
A.    BACKGROUND&#13;
4.1    The Uzen oil field is situated in the southern Mangyshlak region, around the Caspian sea.&#13;
The field was discovered in 1959. Field development commenced in 1961 and production in&#13;
1965. The original total oil in place is estimated at 1.1 billion tons, making the field the second&#13;
largest oil field yet discovered in Kazakstan (after Tengiz). The field is characterized by an&#13;
elongated structure stretching some 38 km and large variations in the permeability of reservoir&#13;
rocks. Uzen oil is sweet (0.17% sulphur), medium light (340 API) with high tar and paraffin&#13;
content and a high pour-point, with the oil congealing at a relatively high temperature (32°&#13;
Centigrade). The proportion of the total oil in place ultimately recoverable has been estimated&#13;
by consultants engaged by the Bank at between 30% and 35%, depending on the level of&#13;
investment and the degree of success in coping with: (a) the complex operational problems&#13;
associated with the field's reservoirs and the properties of its oil; and (b) the consequences of the&#13;
operating practices instituted over the field's producing history. A more detailed description of&#13;
the field's geology is provided in Annex 4.1.&#13;
4.2    For most of its operating life to date, Uzen has been the largest producing field in the&#13;
country. Notwithstanding steep annual declines since 1989, Uzen production in 1995 accounted&#13;
for about 15% of the country's total crude oil production. Cumulative production since the field&#13;
was brought into production amounts to about 245 million tons (1.8 billion barrels) or about&#13;
22.3% of the original oil in place. The economically recoverable remaining reserves are&#13;
estimated at more than 100 million tons1 (750 million barrels based on the specific gravity of&#13;
Uzen oil), making the Uzen field the largest fully-operational oil field in the country. However,&#13;
there is a substantial risk that the technical and commercial management and investments&#13;
necessary to realize this additional oil recovery may not be forthcoming. Under such conditions,&#13;
production in Uzen is likely to cease within the next five years with the additional recovery of&#13;
oil limited to about 10 million tons.&#13;
4.3    Uzen is a microcosm of the domestic oil industry. It typifies the range of operational,&#13;
commercial and institutional problems that, inadequately addressed in the past, have resulted in&#13;
the loss of production from substantial oil reserves which can be made-up only at significantly&#13;
higher costs in the future and with substantial delays in the flow of benefits to the economy.&#13;
B.    ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.4    The Uzen oil field is operated by Uzenmunaigas. Uzenmunaigas, a PA, was formed in&#13;
November 1994 to assume sole management control over all activities and assets related to the&#13;
operation of the Uzen field. Management control of Uzen oil field operations had hitherto been&#13;
divided between Uzenneft -- the field operating unit -- and Mangistaumunaigas -- the regional&#13;
PA.&#13;
I. The level of economically recoverable remaining reserves depends on a number of variables such as oil prices,&#13;
operating costs and technical efficiency in the recovery of oil reserves. Given changes in these variables,&#13;
economically recoverable remaining reserves in the Uzen oil field could conceivably be as high as 200 million&#13;
tons -- the amount of technically recoverable remaining reserves estimated by the relevant Kazakstan competent&#13;
bodies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                  IV. The Beneficiary: Uzenmunaigas&#13;
4.5    Uzenneft was created in 1964 as a field operating unit under the direct administrative&#13;
control of the Ministry of Oil of the FSU. It was transformed into a legally autonomous&#13;
enterprise in 1989 by decree under the USSR Law on State Enterprises. Under its charter,&#13;
Uzenneft was granted operational autonomy in its management of the field but subject to&#13;
production targets and guidelines set by its regional PA. Apart from its operating objectives, the&#13;
charter of Uzenneft requires it to promote social development in its area of operation. This area&#13;
has grown from a small nomadic settlement into a relatively large town of 70,000 inhabitants who&#13;
are economically dependent on the oil field and its related operations.&#13;
4.6    Mangistaumunaigas (MMG) was established in 1975 as the supervisory body of the oil&#13;
producing enterprises and supporting service organizations (drilling, transport, research, etc.)&#13;
operating in the Mangyshlak region. It was transformed into a legally autonomous enterprise&#13;
in November 1992. Under its 1992 charter, MMG was empowered to establish pooled funds&#13;
(drawn from the operating entities) for investments, insurance, procurement of equipment and&#13;
supplies and housing and social infrastructure, with the allocation of investments to be determined&#13;
according to regional development priorities. This provision led to a significant erosion in the&#13;
commercial autonomy of Uzenneft and its ability to make effective operating decisions as control&#13;
over procurement management, investments, oil marketing and sales revenues was progressively&#13;
assumed by MMG and much of the cash flow generated from Uzenneft operations was reinvested&#13;
elsewhere without clear commercial justification.&#13;
4.7   Uzenmunaigas was created by the Government to address the organizational weaknesses&#13;
arising from its relationship with MMG, namely the fragmentation of control over operating and&#13;
commercial decisions and the subordination of its commercial interest to other regional social and&#13;
economic development objectives. Uzenmunaigas was formed by the merger of Uzenneft&#13;
(including the autonomous support groups under its direct supervision) with all MMG divisions&#13;
or units that were wholly or largely dependent on Uzenneft for their workload or that were based&#13;
in the Uzen area.  The merger consolidated all aspects of the operating and commercial&#13;
management of the Uzen field within one organizational unit with (a) three (3) major entities&#13;
(divisions) with outside markets for their outputs; and (b) ten (10) autonomous service units. The&#13;
three major divisions are: (i) oil producing activities based on the Uzenneft operations; (ii) Kazak&#13;
Gas Processing Plant (KGP), an Uzen-based LPG and ethane extraction plant using gas feedstock&#13;
from Uzen and Zhetybai oil fields; and (iii) Mangistau Gas Producers, a non-associated gas&#13;
producing company. The service units were former "structural units" of MMG which provided&#13;
oil field services--drilling, transport, infrastructure maintenance, well plugging, etc.--to its oil and&#13;
gas producing entities on a contract basis. An organizational chart of Uzenmunaigas is attached&#13;
as Chart 1.&#13;
4.8   For management purposes, Uzenmunaigas was structured into 26 self-accounting units,&#13;
managed as profit centers, and comprising the divisions, service units and seven former&#13;
autonomous structural units of Uzenneft and six internal units of one of the service units. A&#13;
schematic representation of the structure of Uzenmunaigas is shown in Chart 2.&#13;
4.9   The November 1994 re-organization left a number of weaknesses which the Government&#13;
recognized would need to be addressed in order to create an appropriate framework to foster&#13;
commercial management of the Uzen field:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. The Beneficiary: Uzenmunaigas                                                  25&#13;
First, the operating mandate of Uzenmnunaigas needs to be strengthened. Uzenrunaigas&#13;
continued to be governed by a charter that gave it neither clear commercial goals nor the&#13;
powers to operate commercially.  It operated under the effective supervisory and&#13;
administrative control of MOG which exercised considerable influence over its investment&#13;
and operating activities. It had no well-defined framework governing the appropriate use&#13;
of its revenues and profits to ensure its financial and operating viability.&#13;
Second, Uzeninunaigas' organization needs to be revamped. The rapid assimilation of&#13;
many structural units into the Uzenneft structure had exacerbated an already inefficient&#13;
internal management structure.  Uzenneft was fragmented into a large number of&#13;
autonomous functionally-based activity centers that were coordinated only at the level of&#13;
the General Director. This structure was further complicated by the reorganization under&#13;
which (a) the number of activity centers has increased significantly; (b) entities that were&#13;
operating as autonomous businesses have been hastily absorbed as activity centers under&#13;
functional managers; these entities have become sources of additional operating costs for&#13;
the organization without, in most cases, any demonstrable commercial benefits to&#13;
Uzenmunaigas; and (c) the span of control of the General Director and his coordinating&#13;
responsibilities have been expanded substantially without any improvements in the&#13;
enterprises's management control systems.&#13;
Third, the excess staffing within the organization needs to be addressed.  The&#13;
reorganization of MMG shifted a substantial direct financial responsibility for supporting&#13;
a large additional labor force from MMG and its other oil producing units to Uzenneft.&#13;
Prior to the reorganization, Uzenneft with a total of 3000 staff (including the work force&#13;
of its structural units and social services agencies supported by it) was over-staffed and&#13;
had attempted, unsuccessfully (due to the resistance of the municipal authorities), to&#13;
relinquish direct responsibility for the staffing and financing of social services in the city.&#13;
The consolidation of the structural units of MMG with Uzenneft has compounded the&#13;
problem of excess staff through the transfer of many non-viable operating units to&#13;
Uzenneft. The merger led to a doubling in the number of staff mainly dedicated to oil&#13;
production and supporting operations to around 7,000 and an increase in the total staff&#13;
within the organization as a whole to about 13,000. This staffing level is extremely high&#13;
in relation to current and feasible future Uzen oil production and the business activity of&#13;
the other operations.&#13;
Finally, the management and skills base of the enterprise needs strengthening. The&#13;
creation of Uzenmunaigas led to further and significant erosion in management skills&#13;
available to the Uzen operations, which had already suffered from significant&#13;
out-migration of traditional oil field workers to other regions of the FSU. The enterprise&#13;
lost both key senior technical management staff attracted by better career prospects in the&#13;
bigger and more diversified MMG and ready access to key management services and&#13;
functions formerly centralized in MMG. These management services include reservoir&#13;
and production planning and management, engineering and computing services, financial&#13;
management,  procurement  management  and  marketing.    Post-reorganization,&#13;
Uzenmunaigas is faced with both recruiting experienced replacement staff and developing&#13;
essential management systems and capabilities for its core oil producing operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                                                IV. The Beneficiary: Uzenmunaigas&#13;
4.10  The Government and Uzenmunaigas have taken or propose to take the following&#13;
additional actions to address the organizational problems outlined above:&#13;
First, Uzenmunaigas was incorporated on May 14, 1996 as a legally autonomous open&#13;
joint-stock enterprise. This incorporation gives it a clear commercial charter, a defined&#13;
capital structure and defined demarcation of control between its management and&#13;
representatives of its owners. It also provides the legal basis for the diversification of&#13;
control of its equity beyond the Government and the enterprise's management. Initially,&#13;
dominant shareholding control would be maintained by the Government.&#13;
Second, the Government has approved a restructuring plan for Uzenmunaigas. The&#13;
restructuring plan has defined (i) the distinct business units to be managed as separate&#13;
divisions into which some of Uzenmunaigas' activities could be regrouped; and (ii) the&#13;
rational organization of other activity centers into cost centers over which effective&#13;
management control could be exercised. The following actions would be implemented&#13;
under the restructuring plan: (a) direct oil production activities would be regrouped into&#13;
an oil producing division; (b) gas production and processing operations would be&#13;
consolidated into a gas division; (c) drilling and workover activities and assets and related&#13;
transportation operations would be grouped into a drilling and workover division; (d) all&#13;
technical and analytical services relations to wells completion and treatment will be&#13;
consolidated into a well services division; (e) pipeline construction and civil engineering&#13;
activities would be bundled into a construction division; (f) housing, utility, potable&#13;
water, recreational, non-occupational health, kindergarten and recreational services and&#13;
facilities would be segregated from other operating activities and consolidated under a&#13;
municipal services unit; and (g) a parent body would be created to provide corporate&#13;
management services and centralize working capital management, financial and&#13;
management accounting control, human resources management and marketing and&#13;
supplies management for oil and gas operations. The executive summary of the&#13;
Restructuring Plan approved by the Government is attached as Annex 4.2.&#13;
Third, Uzenmunaigas has adopted a manpower optimization plan identifying target&#13;
employment levels in its various units and a process for achieving reductions in&#13;
manpower and other costs. This plan has identified total redundancies in the current level&#13;
of staffing of about 7,000, which Uzenmunaigas plans to shed in two phases to be&#13;
implemented over the next year. A detailed study of the options for and relative merits&#13;
and costs of retrenching, cushioning the impact and facilitating the productive&#13;
redeployment of this magnitude of workers is under preparation and will form the basis&#13;
for the detailed implementation of the manpower optimization plan.&#13;
Fourth, a program of action for the privatization of Uzenmunaigas, satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, would be drawn up. The privatization program would involve a reduction in the&#13;
effective equity control of Uzenmunaigas by the Government through a mix of&#13;
participation of strategic investors (bringing in both equity capital and technical and&#13;
commercial know-how) in key business units, the spin-off of part of Uzenmunaigas'&#13;
interest in selected divisions and the divestment of a significant stake in Uzenmunaigas'&#13;
equity through the Government's privatization program. Work on finding strategic&#13;
partners for the Largest segment of Uzenmunaigas activities with the most promising&#13;
prospect for attracting outside investment interest -- the oil reserves and operations -- is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. The Beneficiary: Uzenmunaigas                                             27&#13;
well underway (pard. 5.19). The options and the process for divestment of the&#13;
Government's equity interest in Uzenmunaigas would be defined by Uzenmunaigas and&#13;
the Government in a Privatization Implementation Plan.&#13;
4.11 During negotiations, the preparation of a Privatization Implementation Plan, in&#13;
accordance with terms of reference agreed upon with the Bank, was confirmed as a condition&#13;
of loan effectiveness. The satisfactory implementation of the restructuring and manpower&#13;
optimization plans are covenanted actions under the Loan and Project Agreements.&#13;
4.12 The proposed project would provide assistance for the strengthening of technical and&#13;
commercial management systems, the development and implementation of management systems&#13;
for the reorganized municipal services unit, the training of management and other staff, and the&#13;
temporary financing of external technical expertise.&#13;
C.   FIELD FACILIrES AND INRASTRUCTURE&#13;
4.13  A detailed description of the production facilities and infrastructure of the Uzen field is&#13;
given at Annex 4.3. The field has a total of about 3,290 production wells of which about 1,600&#13;
are currently (June 1995) inoperative. About 164 of the wells employ gas lift for production&#13;
with the balance operated on sucker rod pumps. The average spacing of wells is 14.5 hectares&#13;
per well. Water injection was instituted in 1967 to maintain reservoir pressure. Of the field's&#13;
total of 1,249 injection wells, about 944 are currently (June 1995) active. About 120,000 tons&#13;
of sea water is injected daily into the reservoir.&#13;
4.14 The oil processing infrastructure of the field comprises 70 group gathering stations served&#13;
by about 250 sputniks and a central processing plant located about 40 km from the field. The&#13;
backbone of the oil processing system is a network of approximately 2,900 km of fluid gathering&#13;
lines. The water injection system, including a sea water supply line of 150 km from the Caspian&#13;
seaport of Aktau, comprises 1,516 km of pipelines, four water pumping stations and 26 injection&#13;
stations. The present surface production facilities, including the sea water injection system, were&#13;
designed by the All Union Oil Scientific Research Institute in Moscow. However, the design&#13;
as well as the construction of the facilities were carried out without apparent adequate&#13;
consideration for corrosion protection, quality assurance and environmental protection. Coupled&#13;
with insufficient recurrent investments for maintenance and inadequate maintenance practices,&#13;
the facilities are extensively and heavily corroded and subject to frequent failures. Consultants&#13;
engaged by the Bank to review the condition of the field's oil processing infrastructure have&#13;
concluded that the facilities are close to the end of their useful lives and will require major&#13;
rehabilitation in the short to medium term.&#13;
D.   PRODUCTION HISTORY&#13;
4.15 Recent oil production in the Uzen field is shown in the table below. Oil production in&#13;
Uzen peaked at around 326,000 bbllday (16.3 million tons per annum) in 1975. Production&#13;
declined sharply thereafter to about 188,000 bbllday (about 9.0 million tons per annum) in 1980&#13;
despite an extensive drilling program. The sharp production decline was arrested between 1980&#13;
and 1989 when production was stabilized at around 175,000 bbllday through a policy of selective&#13;
perforation of wells, increased water flooding and systematic chemical injection. However,&#13;
between 1989 and 1993, production declined precipitously from 168,000 bbllday to 86,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

bbl/day, an average annual rate of decline of 18 %. The decline in production accelerated further&#13;
in 1994 to an average rate of 64,000 bbllday. Current production is at the rate of about 55,000&#13;
bbl/day.&#13;

4.16 Production in Uzen has encountered significant difficulties due to the characteristics of&#13;
the oil and the reservoir and the effects of the water flooding regime employed. Deposition of&#13;
wax in the weilbores and back pressure induced by it has led to the need for frequent minor&#13;
workovers (every six months) and major workovers (every two years) to increase pumping&#13;
efficiency and maintain production. The deposition of wax near production weilbores leads to&#13;
the clogging of the pores in producing zones and reduced well productivity. The use of&#13;
untreated seawater for water injection and its mixing with formation water (in the reservoir) has&#13;
resulted in sexious scaling in the injector wells and extensive corrosion in both the injector wells&#13;
and the surface production and transport facilities. This has contributed to the need for frequent&#13;
major workover of injection wells, deterioration in the condition of such wells and a high rate&#13;
of leaks and failures in the surface facilities. The established practice of injection of cold water&#13;
into the reservoir which has a naturally low temperature has probably led to solidification of oil&#13;
in the reservoir rock pores reducing the efficiency of oil recovery. In addition, water injection&#13;
pressures are extremely high and have probably resulted in some fracturing of the reservoir&#13;
adding to the problems of managing the efficiency of water flooding in the highly heterogenous&#13;
reservoir.&#13;
4.17 To suppress wax deposition, Uzenneft instituted a systematic program of chemical&#13;
injection from early in the field's life to the late 1980s. However, owing to lack of funds to&#13;
import chemicals, the program of injection became increasingly intermittent and much of the&#13;
treatment equipment is now in a state of disrepair for lack of maintenance. At the same time&#13;
as chemical injection has declined, the capacity of the enterprise to deal with the symptoms of&#13;
uninhibited wax build-up has been deteriorating. The enterprise's fleet of service and major&#13;
workover rigs is old in relation to its design life and many units suffer from serious stress&#13;
fractures. The availability of rigs is uncertain. Operational logistics have grown increasingly&#13;
difficult due to organizational fragmentation and a very limited number of complementary&#13;
vehicles for the transport of equipment and material. In addition, the availability of spare parts&#13;
for wells and equipment has been intermittent and unpredictable because, until recently, foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. The Beneficiary: Uzenmunaigas                                               29&#13;
procurement decisions were made outside of Uzenneft without, in many instances, regard for&#13;
the nature and timing of its requirements. With growing unpredictability of the availability of&#13;
resources, work planning has become increasingly irrelevant, wells maintenance is ad-hoc and&#13;
there is increasing danger of a complete breakdown of the field's maintenance management&#13;
systems. All these problems are reflected in an increasing backlog of service and workover of&#13;
wells, increasing numbers of inoperative wells and the steep decline in production.&#13;
4.18 With regard to water flooding practices, the field has been locked into an infrastructure&#13;
for which it has not had the resources to modify or maintain to avoid massive corrosion&#13;
problems. No sustained program of corrosion or scale inhibition has been attempted.&#13;
4.19 While the field management is aware of much of the appropriate practices that need to&#13;
be pursued in the field, the setting of rigid technical policies by outsiders coupled with the lack&#13;
of resources has inhibited adoption of such practices.  In addition, effective operational&#13;
management in Uzenneft has been practically impossible due to the unreliability or lack of&#13;
equipment and systems to measure and monitor key production inputs and outputs and the&#13;
performance of wells on an accurate and timely basis.&#13;
E.   ENVIRONMENTAL CONDMONS&#13;
4.20 Environmental conditions in the Uzen Field are typical of those in the majority of oil&#13;
production operations in the FSU. They reflect a legacy of general neglect of environmental&#13;
issues and the inadequacy of environmental management and compliance during the Soviet&#13;
period. There were few incentives for effective environmental management but substantial&#13;
pressures on oil producers to produce as much oil as possible and as early as possible. The&#13;
pressures to produce large amounts of oil were reinforced by substantial incentives for achieving&#13;
or surpassing various production quotas for fluid and oil production, volumes of exploratory&#13;
and development drilling, water-flooding volumes, etc. At the same time, while there existed&#13;
an extensive framework of environmental legislation and regulatory standards, compliance and&#13;
enforcement mechanisms were weak. As a result of this framework of incentives, oil field&#13;
operations were characterized, by among other things, dense well-spacing, excessive and often&#13;
irrational use of water-flooding and lack of environmental safeguards in equipment and&#13;
operations.&#13;
4.21 The Environmental Assessment conducted by the Government (with financial assistance&#13;
of the Government of Canada through a Bank-administered trust fund) as part of the preparation&#13;
of the project has identified the following existing environmental conditions in the Uzen oil field&#13;
and neighboring areas:&#13;
Air. The Uzen area air basin is subject to significant air pollution through emissions of&#13;
various pollutants arising from oil spills and leaks, gas flaring, and chronic excessive&#13;
emissions from industrial equipment and plants, particularly from KGP's facilities.&#13;
Uzenmunaigas and the local environment agencies do not perform systematic and regular&#13;
monitoring of emission levels in the area. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur&#13;
dioxide and volatile organic compounds are many times the maximum permissible levels.&#13;
For instance, sulphur dioxide concentrations in the Uzen field have been observed to be&#13;
up to 20 times higher, and those in the town of Zhana Uzen up to 10 times higher, than&#13;
the maximum permissible concentrations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                   IV. The Beneficiary: Uzemnrunaigas&#13;
Surface Water. There are no pernanent surface water bodies in the field area. However,&#13;
the limited runoff during periodic storms transports pollutants to local topographic&#13;
depressions, contributing to creation of localities with relatively high surface&#13;
concentrations of pollutants.&#13;
Ground Water. The ground water aquifer in the field area is relatively deep (more than&#13;
70 meters) and the local soils are of low perrneability. The environmental impact of field&#13;
operations on the groundwater aquifer has been limited to occasional pollution by&#13;
produced fluid and injected sea water arising from the poor integrity of cementing and&#13;
casing corrosion in water injection wells. However, since the groundwater in the field&#13;
and its immediate vicinity is characterized by high natural salinity and is not used for&#13;
either industrial or household purposes, this pollution is not considered to be threatening&#13;
to water supplies. The only source of potable water in the area is in sand dune aquifers&#13;
located about 30 km from the oil field. These aquifers provide about 30 % of the potable&#13;
water supply to the Uzen area and are not affected directly by operations in the Uzen&#13;
field. However, the potable water requirements of the field and poor water use practices&#13;
have contributed to the rapid harvesting of the aquifers and, given the aquifers' low&#13;
recharge rate, possible endangerment of this source of supply.&#13;
Landform and Soils. Substantial physical land disturbances are evident around the field,&#13;
particularly in the areas of dense well spacing. Most of these disturbances are the result&#13;
of vehicle traffic and soil mounding. There are few well-defined access roads in the&#13;
field, traffic discipline is poor and there is little restoration of sites after earth-moving&#13;
works. Across the field, there are numerous pits and depressions filled with tar and&#13;
formation-water. Some of these receptacles are planned storage or disposal sites but&#13;
many are also the result of accidental leaks and spills. The largest of these pits occupies&#13;
an area of more than 70 hectare and contains an estimated 300,000 tons of a mixture of&#13;
produced water and heavy hydrocarbon fractions---one of the largest oil lakes in the&#13;
FSU.&#13;
Vegetation and Wildlife. Most of the native vegetation has been destroyed in the field&#13;
within approximately 50 meters of wellheads, around infrastructure facilities (group&#13;
stations, central processing facilities, etc.), in areas of intensive vehicular traffic, and in&#13;
and around various pits, waste dumps, and dikes. The wildlife in the area is limited.&#13;
However, field operations have prompted the extensive migration of wildlife from the&#13;
area.&#13;
Land Use and Social Impacts. The area occupied by field operations can sustain only a&#13;
limited ainount of grazing in its virgin state. The withdrawal of lands from traditional&#13;
camel grazing has thus had only a relatively moderate negative impact. However, the&#13;
social structure of the indigenous local communities changed significantly as a substantial&#13;
migrant population moved to the area and local inhabitants abandoned traditional&#13;
occupations to seek employment in the field and related industries and services. These&#13;
changes affected settlement patterns as well, displacing traditional small semi-nomadic&#13;
communities by an industrial town that is dependent on continuing petroleum production&#13;
for its existence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. The Beneficiary: Uzenmunaigas                                                         31&#13;
4.22 Regulatory oversight for environmental issues in the Uzen oil field area is fragmented.&#13;
The administration of environmental and occupational safety regulations within the Uzen oil field&#13;
and Uzenmunaigas' industrial facilities is performed by the local branch of the Sanitation and&#13;
Epidemiological Service. The monitoring of the impact of oil production and related operations&#13;
on environmental conditions in the area, outside the industrial sites, is the responsibility of the&#13;
Environmental Protection Committee. In addition, other separate autonomous agencies exist for&#13;
the protection of marine life, wildlife and game, forests (including forestry management), and&#13;
soils. There is little coordination and cooperation between the environmental agencies and very&#13;
limited compliance enforcement capacity.&#13;
4.23 Within Uzenmunaigas, environmental management is carried out by an Environment and&#13;
Safety Division. The division has a full-time staff of six, including two full-time environmental&#13;
staff. This staff does not have formal environmental or petroleum operations training. No&#13;
laboratory or monitoring facilities and equipment are available. Prior to the separation of&#13;
Uzenmunaigas from MMG, environmental research, monitoring and planning services were&#13;
provided to the Uzen oil operations by the environmental laboratory of Kaznipineft, a subsidiary&#13;
of MMG. These services can now only be provided to Uzenmunaigas on a commercial basis.&#13;
However, due to equipment and staffing constraints, the services provided by Kaznipineft are&#13;
not fully satisfactory. Uzenmunaigas has not purchased the services since the reorganization due&#13;
to its dissatisfaction with the quality of service available and its deteriorating financial position&#13;
and ability to pay for any such services.&#13;
F.    FINANCIAL PERF ORMANCE&#13;
4.24 The recent financial performance and position of Uzenmunaigas and that of its dominant&#13;
oil producing segment is summarized in the table below and detailed in Annex 4.4. The accounts&#13;
are based on Kazakstan statutory accounting standards and Uzenmunaigas' accounting practices.&#13;
Kazakstan accounting standards are generally less conservative than International Accounting&#13;
Standards (IAS). Accounting practices within Uzenmunaigas with respect to transfer of goods&#13;
and services between different cost and activity centers and consolidation practices further&#13;
reinforce this relative lack of conservatism by leading to an overstatement of profits and assets&#13;
for the group as a whole.&#13;

Source: Uzenmunaigas, Bank mission and consultants' estimates&#13;
4.25   During the preparation of the project, a major international firm  of accountants was&#13;
engaged by the Bank (with funding from a USAID trust fund) to review the accounting policies,&#13;
practices and systems employed by Uzenmunaigas and to assess their impact on Uzenmunaigas'&#13;
financial management and control practices and disclosed financial statements. This review&#13;
identified significant weaknesses in Uzenmunaigas' accounting systems and procedures, in&#13;
general, and its revenue and related debtors' accounting systems, in particular.  These&#13;
weaknesses, which in Kazakstan are exhibited to some degree by enterprises in all subsectors,&#13;
indicate that the accounts do not reflect Uzenmunaigas' true financial performance and position.&#13;
However, they provide some indication of its parlous financial condition. In particular,&#13;
Uzenmunaigas is currently insolvent. A significant proportion of its accounts receivable assets&#13;
are considered to be uncollectible and a large proportion of its current liabilities consist of tax&#13;
liabilities and overdue payments to critical local suppliers. Uzenmunaigas' financial gearing is&#13;
low with debt at 11 % of capital employed. However, although the cash generation of its oil&#13;
producing division has improved considerably in the last 18 months in line with improved oil&#13;
prices, its debt capacity is low given its present level of oil production and profitability.&#13;
4.26 To supplement the review of Uzenmunaigas' financial accounts, a detailed analysis of&#13;
Uzenmunaigas' cash journals and banking transactions was also undertaken by the consultants.&#13;
The analysis indicated that, for the first eight months of 1995 for which the cash review was&#13;
undertaken, cash generation from external sales amounted to an estimated 50% of sales revenues&#13;
with the oil producing segment accounting for about 90% of external sales revenues and cash&#13;
generation. About 70% of the total cash generation from sales of US$48 million equivalent&#13;
during the period was absorbed by salaries and payroll-related taxes. Given the low level of&#13;
cash generated from sales relative to its total operating costs, Uzenmunaigas' core oil producing&#13;
division has had to finance non-labor expenses primarily through arrears of payments to&#13;
suppliers and barter of petroleum products while the enterprise's other operating units have been&#13;
totally reliant on subsidies from the parent body, financed by external borrowing, to fund cash&#13;
operating expenses. The shortfall in cash generation has also led to the accumulation of&#13;
substantial arrears on non-payroll tax liabilities assessed on the basis of accrued revenues and&#13;
profits. These overdue tax payments currently (January 1996) amount to about US$28 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
&#13;

IV. The Beneficiary: Uzenmunaigas                                                 33&#13;
4.27 To cope with the squeeze on its cash resources, Uzenmunaigas has been compelled to&#13;
defer maintenance and investments and prolong a vicious cycle of lower production, lower sales,&#13;
lower revenues and cash generation and reduced capacity to clear its arrears of payments to&#13;
suppliers and the tax authorities.&#13;
4.28 A number of factors account for Uzenmunaigas' poor financial situation:&#13;
(i)    production from the three Uzenmunaigas units with external markets has been&#13;
stagnant or declining while the work force and cost structure of these units are&#13;
too high in relation to the level of recent activity;&#13;
(ii)   the 23 other self-accounting supporting structural units of Uzenmunaigas are&#13;
vastly overnanned and of low productivity but account for over 70% of the&#13;
group's costs (Annex 4.5); much of these costs are not necessary for the viable&#13;
commercial operation of Uzenmunaigas;&#13;
(iii)   the internal organization of Uzenmunaigas provides a strong incentive for poor&#13;
cost and efficiency controls: structural units are organized as profit-making units&#13;
and allowed to price on a cost-plus basis notwithstanding that many such units&#13;
should be functional departments and cost centers focussing on minimizing costs&#13;
for the group;&#13;
(iv)   financial and management accounting and control systems and policies are&#13;
extremely weak or inadequate;&#13;
(v)    the organization of the operating units without external markets as profit centers&#13;
has created taxable entities whose sales to other group units, profits and expenses&#13;
are subject to taxation; this creates a huge and avoidable additional taxation&#13;
liability on internal transactions which has ultimately to be financed from the&#13;
cash generated by the three units with outside markets;&#13;
(vi)    while unit gross profit margins on oil sales have increased substantially since&#13;
early 1995, the cashflow from sales has been squeezed by sharp increases in the&#13;
arrears of payments from domestic customers; in addition, most of&#13;
Uzenmunaigas' direct (non-swap) domestic sales are on a barter basis and do not&#13;
generate cash; and&#13;
(vii)   Uzenmunaigas has limited oil marketing skills and it is constrained by informal&#13;
Government directives to selling a significant share of its oil production through&#13;
the Atyrau refinery where technological constraints limit the value of output and&#13;
market conditions in its catchment area restrict the opportunity for cash sales.&#13;
4.29 To resolve its short-term liquidity problem and lay the basis for effective financial&#13;
management in the future, the following measures are proposed to be taken by Uzenmunaigas:&#13;
(i) the strengthening of the management of its receivables and its receivables collection efforts;&#13;
(ii) the refinancing of critical overdue tax liabilities and suppliers' credits; this can be achieved&#13;
either through medium-term borrowing from local financial institutions or by a combination of&#13;
the rescheduling of overdue tax liabilities (to the extent permissible under the Income Tax Code)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

and cash infusion; (iii) the restructuring of its operations into tax-efficient, economically-&#13;
meaningful units; other things being equal, this will reduce the tax-take by the Governnent from&#13;
the group but will ensure that its taxation is economically efficient i.e phantom profits will not&#13;
be subject to tax; (iv) the preparation and implementation of a plan to reduce its work force to&#13;
a size more appropriate to the prospective level of business and to better control its cost; and&#13;
(v) the strengthening of its oil marketing capacity and ability to sell crude oil and gas on&#13;
commercial terms.&#13;
4.30 The measures outlined above have been incorporated in a formal Short-term Working&#13;
Capital Financing Plan (supported by a detailed cash flow budget) that has been prepared and&#13;
adopted by Uzenmunaigas and approved by the Government. The summary of the plan is&#13;
attached as Annex 4.6. The implementation of this Plan by the Borrower and Uzenmunaigas,&#13;
in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, is a covenanted agreement under the Loan and Project&#13;
Agreements. In view of the importance of the management of receivables to the short term&#13;
liquidity of Uzenmunaigas, agreement was reached with the Government and Uzenmunaigas&#13;
during negotiations, that Uzenmunaigas will (a) maintain, beginning with its fiscal year ending&#13;
December 31, 1997, its accounts receivable at a level no greater than 45 days of annual&#13;
revenues until completion of the project, and (b) furnish quarterly to the Bank an aged analysis&#13;
of its receivables. A format for the aged analysis to be submitted to the Bank was agreed upon&#13;
at negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. THE REHABILITA TION PROGRAM&#13;
A.    REHABILITATION STRATEGY&#13;
5.1    A detailed assessment of Uzen Oil Field's reservoirs and facilities was undertaken by&#13;
consultants (financed under a Bank-administered Government of Canada Trust Fund) in 1993.&#13;
The consultants concluded that the total recovery of oil from the field could range from 30% to&#13;
35% of the original oil-in-place in the field (of which about 23% has already been recovered),&#13;
if a rehabilitation program is instituted to address four key problems faced by the field: (i) the&#13;
inefficiency of the water flooding; (ii) the accumulation of wax in wells; (iii) the inefficiency of&#13;
downhole pumps; and (iv) the inadequate well completion practices. The consultants identified&#13;
a potential to increase average oil production, per well by about 140%, from about 42 bbl/day&#13;
to 105 bbl/day. In addition, at peak production after the rehabilitation of all producing wells, the&#13;
annual rate of extraction of oil would increase from a current 1.2% of the estimated remaining&#13;
oil-in-place to between 2.5% and 3.0%. With sustained improvements in field operations, the&#13;
subsequent decline in production would moderate to the pre-1989 rate of around 5% per annum&#13;
compared to the post-1989 average rate of decline of over 20% per annum. The surface&#13;
infrastructure assessment confirmed that the present facilities are close to the end of their useful&#13;
lives and, except for a few salvageable pumps and facilities, would require complete replacement&#13;
in the near future.&#13;
5.2    Based on these assessments, Uzenmunaigas has formulated a preliminary strategy for the&#13;
rehabilitation of the field as follows:&#13;
a.    The rehabilitation (major workover) of all currently active producer wells that&#13;
meet economic viability criteria;&#13;
b.    The rehabilitation of injector wells serving the rehabilitated producer wells;&#13;
C.    The replacement of all flow lines, first-stage separators and gathering stations and&#13;
oil and fluid transfer lines;&#13;
d.    Subject to the economic and financial constraints faced, the rehabilitation on a&#13;
modular basis of the central processing facility and installation of an intermediate&#13;
fluid reduction facility or the phased replacement of remote central processing by&#13;
construction of in-field processing facilities;&#13;
e.    The rehabilitation of the water injection stations;&#13;
f.    The maximization of the use of recycled produced water and the extensive&#13;
chemical and mechanical treatment of recycled and make-up sea water;&#13;
g.    The replacement and shortening of the current water supply system  by the&#13;
relocation of the water intake source from Aktau to Kazak Bay and the&#13;
construction of a 70 km water pipeline from Kazak Bay to the field; and&#13;
h.    The modification of the waterflooding pattern by selective drilling and shut-in of&#13;
injection and producer wells.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                        V. The Rehabilitation Program&#13;
5.3   The proposed rehabilitation strategy would have important environmental benefits. The&#13;
extensive replacement of the surface production facilities and changes in operating practices&#13;
designed to prevent premature corrosion of the facilities and reduce operating costs would prevent&#13;
future contamination of the field from oil spills, the minimization of the need to dispose of&#13;
produced fluid and a significant reduction in the requirement of make-up water from the Caspian&#13;
Sea for water-flooding operations. In addition, Uzenmunaigas would utilize part of the free cash&#13;
flow from any rehabilitation program to finance the remediation of past environmental damage&#13;
to the field.&#13;
B.    ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROGRAM&#13;
5.4   The projected operating and financial performance of the Uzen oil field with and without&#13;
the implementation of a full rehabilitation program covering the whole field is shown in Annex&#13;
5.1. The assumptions used in the projections are detailed in Annex 8.3. The profile of the&#13;
investments made, production and sales are detailed in the tables in Annex 5.1.&#13;
5.5   The investment program considered in the projections include: (a) the workover of all&#13;
existing non-abandoned producing and injection wells; (b) the servicing and refurbishment of&#13;
most of the currently operating wells in the early period of the program before a full workover&#13;
capacity is mobilized; (c) the replacement of the centralized fluid-processing facilities; (d) the&#13;
rehabilitation of the water injection system; and (e) the replacement of the current water supply&#13;
system. The investment program excludes the modification of the waterflooding pattern by&#13;
selective drilling and shut-in of new injector and producing wells. The total estimated investment&#13;
cost of the program  reviewed is US$860 million.  The cost excludes any resources for&#13;
strengthening management systems and capabilities and environmental remediation.&#13;
5.6   Based on the above investment program and the oil recovery rates projected by the&#13;
reservoir engineering consultants, total recoverable oil reserves over a 19-year producing period&#13;
(the economic limit of the field given the profile of production, operating costs and projected oil&#13;
prices) is projected at about 80 million tons (about 600 million barrels). This recovery rate is&#13;
considered conservative. Simulations performed by the reservoir engineers indicate that a&#13;
program of waterflood pattern modifications combined with improved reservoir management&#13;
practices over the field as a whole could yield additional oil production of about 14 million tons&#13;
(100 million barrels), for a total of 94 million tons (700 million barrels). In addition, modestly&#13;
higher oil prices than assumed in the projections would extend the economic limit of the field and&#13;
lead to an increase in economically recoverable reserves.&#13;
5.7   Without the rehabilitation program, the recent rate of decline in production is expected&#13;
to continue. Under such conditions and based on the current cost structure, the field will be&#13;
uneconomic to operate within five years after an aggregate additional oil production of about 9.5&#13;
million tons (70 million barrels).&#13;
5.8   The real economic (pre-tax) and financial (post-tax) rate of returns to the rehabilitation&#13;
program are summarized in the table below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. The Rehabilitation Program                                                     37&#13;
THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL REruRNs TO THE REHABILrrATION PROGRAM&#13;
Discount Rate&#13;
12%         15%         17%&#13;
NPV of Program Cash Flow (Pre-tax) (million US$)  243        166         127&#13;
NPV of Program Cash Flow (Post-tax) (million US$)  60        24            5&#13;
NPV of Government Taxes (million US$)            183         142         122&#13;
5.9    The projections indicate that the comprehensive rehabilitation of the field is potentially&#13;
viable. The prospective after-tax returns to investors are acceptable. The returns to investors&#13;
could be improved substantially if the assumed tax structure, which is based on the present&#13;
treatment of domestic oil enterprises, is more in line with the existing treatment of joint ventures&#13;
i.e places greater emphasizes on the taxation of profits rather than on levies on revenues. The&#13;
upside potential returns are also substantial. For example, an average oil price of US$70 per&#13;
ton, compared to US$57 per ton used in the projection, would lead to a post-tax rate of return&#13;
of about 26%.&#13;
C.    CONSTRANTS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A RE4ABiLBTATION PROGRAM&#13;
5.10   There are substantial impediments to the implementation of a full rehabilitation program.&#13;
The program would require total financing of US$0.9 billion and, assuming that all available&#13;
cashflow from the program is reinvested in the field, projected external financing of about&#13;
US$0.2 to $0.3 billion. Uzenmunaigas cannot self-finance the investment requirements for the&#13;
program or raise the program's financing requirements domestically. In addition, the enterprise&#13;
does not have the technical or project management experience to execute effectively a&#13;
rehabilitation program of such scale and complexity in a way that will minimize external&#13;
fmancing requirements. The ability of Uzenmunaigas to implement the program depends&#13;
critically on its capacity to attract both foreign financial and technical resources. However,&#13;
Uzenmunaigas has faced three sets of constraints on its ability to attract such resources: (i) the&#13;
relative attractiveness of Kazakstan country conditions for foreign oil investors; (ii) the potential&#13;
problems and risks inherent in a mature producing oil field in Kazakstan; and (iii) the limited&#13;
experience of the Government and Uzenmunaigas in managing a program for the solicitation of&#13;
external investors.&#13;
5.11   Country Contditons.  As noted in Chapter 2 of this SAR,  Kazakstan has made&#13;
significant progress in the last year in creating a hospitable and stable commercial environment&#13;
for investments in the oil and gas sector. While more work needs to be done on the&#13;
administrative aspects of both the legal and fiscal framework, the direction of reform is both&#13;
positive and firmly established. The domestic market for crude oil and petroleum products has&#13;
been liberalized and substantial complementary reforms in the structure of the industry have&#13;
already been made. However, transport constraints cap the country's oil production potential,&#13;
limit exports to international markets and render the total level of oil exports volatile. Despite&#13;
these conditions, foreign investment interest in exploration acreage and in discovered but&#13;
undeveloped reserves continues to be strong because licenses over such properties are valuable&#13;
options as long as there is no commitment, over a reasonably long period, to exercise them by&#13;
investing in field development. However, interest in the actual development of reserves or in&#13;
investment in developed, producing fields is limited for three reasons: (i) lack of assured markets&#13;
for large scale production; (ii) investor concerns about regional and Kazakstan macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                                        V. The Rehabilitation Program&#13;
stability and the inability to hedge against this perceived instability without direct access to&#13;
international markets; and (iii) the problems associated with the management of established&#13;
producing oil fields.&#13;
5.12   Problems Inherent to Mature Field Operations. As the detailed description and analysis&#13;
of Uzenmunaigas' organization and operations in Chapter 4 of the SAR shows, prospective&#13;
external investors in mature oil fields face considerable potential risks and uncertainties:&#13;
First, the organization of oil enterprises is inefficient and not conducive to commercially&#13;
viable operations. The organization of oil enterprises is based on narrow specialization&#13;
and division of labor, high degree of integration of all aspects of oil field operations into&#13;
single enterprises, extensive fragmentation and duplication in the management of&#13;
operations, and internal financial cross-subsidization of many non-viable activities. The&#13;
high degree of specialization and the organization of activities into autonomous units&#13;
along functional lines leads to considerable redundancy of labor as weHl as waste of&#13;
other resources. The incentive for enterprises to restructure their organization and&#13;
manpower is low since oil enterprises in Kazakstan currently have no clearly defined&#13;
mandate or powers to operate as autonomous and commercially-oriented entities.&#13;
Further, the flexibility to reorganize is severely constrained by the historic and&#13;
continuing role of oil enterprises as the primary source of employment and financing of&#13;
social services and amenities in the oil producing regions of the country. Without&#13;
organizational restructuring to address these problems or to create special purpose&#13;
organizations without the labor burdens and commercial restrictions of traditional oil&#13;
enterprises, external investment in mature oil producing enterprises is unlikely to be&#13;
forthcoming.&#13;
Second, mature producing oil fields like Uzen have been subjected to operating practices&#13;
that are significantly different from those pursued in other parts of the world. While&#13;
the practices are well-known, there is considerable uncertainty about their impact on the&#13;
condition of the wells and gathering and processing facilities in such fields. In the case&#13;
of Uzen and many other mature fields, this uncertainty is exacerbated by the lack of a&#13;
complete history of basic operating information (particularly relating to production from&#13;
individual wells and the integrity of gathering facilities) and the perceived distortions or&#13;
unreliability of available operating information.   The acquisition of additional&#13;
information on past operations and their impact on future operating costs and&#13;
investments is a hurdle not confronted by undeveloped fields in the country or by many&#13;
developed producing fields in many other oil-producing countries competing for foreign&#13;
investment resources. This informational penalty is particularly high in the case of&#13;
fields with a long history of production and complex reservoir characteristics.&#13;
Third, mature producing fields in Kazakstan have been subject to considerable&#13;
environmental degradation as a consequence of operating practices, the lack of&#13;
incentives to enterprises to minimize environmental damage, and the absence of effective&#13;
compliance mechanisms. The extent of environmental damage as weLl as the degree to&#13;
which the safety of assets has been compromised by unsound practices is generally&#13;
undocumented and unknown. There is either no financial provision for restoration of&#13;
fields or the adequacy of such provision is highly uncertain. The absence of information&#13;
on existing environmental and occupational safety liabilities poses considerable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. The Rehabilitation Programn                                                   39&#13;
uncertainties about the allocation of responsibility for the costs of their rectification in&#13;
the future.&#13;
5.13   Solicitation of External Investors.  Given their relatively lesser attractiveness as&#13;
investment targets, mature oil producing assets and operations emerging from an operating and&#13;
business environment typical of those faced by Uzen need substantially stronger promotional&#13;
efforts than exploration or discovered but undeveloped prospects. A well-structured promotional&#13;
effort would need to include all of the following key elements: (i) the formulation of a strategy&#13;
for optimizing the long-term return to the field; (ii) the defmition of the possible bases for&#13;
extemal participation in the realization of such a strategy; (iii) the identification of the country&#13;
and field-specific risks entailed in an investment and the development of a strategy for resolving&#13;
or protecting potential investors against them; (iv) the selection, collection, packaging and&#13;
dissemination of information on the field and its operation in a way that is useful to potential&#13;
investors; and (v) the evaluation of the capacity of prospective investors to fulfill their technical&#13;
and financial obligation under any operating agreement entered into with the Government and&#13;
Uzenmunaigas.&#13;
5.14   Although the Govemment and Uzenmunaigas have long been active in promoting Uzen&#13;
to potential foreign operators and investors, these efforts have not been guided by a well-defined&#13;
strategy and have been largely unsuccessful: (a) a number of attractive candidates have been&#13;
deterred from further evaluation of the field because of perceived problems with the quality of&#13;
data made available on the field or the perceived country and specific investment risks; (b) a&#13;
large number of agreements, some with potentially conflicting terms, have been entered into&#13;
without adequate assessment of the possible impact of their terms on the optimal exploitation of&#13;
the field's reservoir and the financial returns to Uzenmunaigas; this has also deterred or may&#13;
serve to deter some potential operators concemed about the limited prospects under such&#13;
conditions for rational management of the field as a whole; and (c) a substantial amount of&#13;
management time has been devoted to seeking to secure agreements with parties with little&#13;
prospect of being able to contribute to the effective implementation of a comprehensive&#13;
rehabilitation program.&#13;
D.    THE ROLE OF THE BANK IN THE REHABILITATION PROGRAM&#13;
5.15   Following its earlier unsuccessful efforts at attracting foreign investors to the Uzen field,&#13;
the Government approached the Bank in early 1993 to assist in the rehabilitation of the field and&#13;
prevent the premature cessation of its operations. The Bank's principal role since then has been&#13;
to assist the Govermment and Uzenmunaigas in developing and implementing (i) the elements of&#13;
a promotional strategy defmed in para 5.13 above; and (ii) measures to strengthen&#13;
Uzenmunaigas' performance. These activities are summarized below.&#13;
5.16   Formulation of a Rehabilitation Strategy. The Bank has commissioned a number of&#13;
technical and environmental studies to determine the viability of the rehabilitation of the field.&#13;
The results of these studies have helped the Government and the Bank to establish the conditions&#13;
under which the rehabilitation of the field would be viable and have formed the basis for the&#13;
development of the rehabilitation program evaluated above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                                                     V. The Rehabilitation Program&#13;
5.17  Identification of Sector and Uzen-Specific Issues and Risks. The Bank has worked with&#13;
the Government to develop a program of policy reforms, covering taxation, pricing and sector&#13;
organization, to underpin the financial viability of sector operations. During the early stages of&#13;
the preparation of a rehabilitation program, these policies were identified as critical to the&#13;
viability of the Uzen field. The policy reforms were implemented as part of the Government's&#13;
Anti-Crisis Program which was supported by the Bank's SAL operation (Ln 3900-KZ). The&#13;
Bank has also been active in helping the Government to prepare and implement a program of&#13;
pre-investment studies for a domestic oil pipeline to integrate the country's refineries and the&#13;
main oil-producing region.&#13;
5.18   On Uzen-specific issues, the Bank, early in its involvement in Uzen, identified the need&#13;
for organizational reform to pave the way for the effective commercial and technical&#13;
management of the Uzen oil field. As a first step, the Government de-merged the Uzen oil field&#13;
from MMG, the regional PA. To further strengthen the newly created organization, the Bank&#13;
has assisted the Government in undertaking a number of accounting and organizational studies&#13;
to identify critical impediments to the effective commercial management of Uzenmunaigas. A&#13;
program for the reorganization and privatization of Uzenmunaigas and the strengthening of its&#13;
short-term working capital position and management control systems have been developed based&#13;
on the findings of these studies. In addition, the Bank has been instrumental in helping the&#13;
Government and Uzenmunaigas to define (for the first time in the history of Uzen or of a&#13;
producing field in Kazakstan) the sources and scale of environmental degradation and a program&#13;
to start remedying such damage.&#13;
5.19   Direct Support for Promotional Actvities. At the request of the Government in late&#13;
1993, the Bank helped to design and finance (through a PPF advance under the Petroleum&#13;
Technical Assistance Project) a work program for advisors to assist the Government in&#13;
developing and implementing a strategy for attracting long term equity partners to the field. A&#13;
major financial advisory firm was selected by the Government in February 1994 to perform these&#13;
services. The task of the advisors has included: (i) the formulation of a basis for outside&#13;
participation in the rehabilitation of the field; (ii) establishment of a process for promotion of&#13;
the field; (iii) collection and due diligence review of information on the field; (iv) preparation&#13;
of an Information Memorandum and solicitation of interest in the field; and (v) assistance to the&#13;
Government in evaluating, structuring and negotiating investment proposals and agreements&#13;
arising from the solicitation process. Bank support has been critical to progress in this activity&#13;
in a number of ways: (a) the information on the field and Uzenmunaigas is based principally&#13;
on the studies prepared for the Bank by consultants; (b) the Bank has been instrumental in&#13;
securing agreement by the Government and Uzenmunaigas to the centralized management of the&#13;
field's reservoirs to optimize long term oil recovery in contrast to Uzenmunaigas' earlier practice&#13;
of seeking to award wholly independently managed portions of the field to outside investors; the&#13;
balkanization of reservoir management would undermine the prospects for success in the field's&#13;
promotion as well as result in sub-optimal recovery of oil from the field; and (c) the Bank has&#13;
been able to reach agreement with the Government and Uzenmunaigas on a process of&#13;
independent review by the financial advisors of all new proposed investment agreements outside&#13;
of the promotion process being organized by them; this ensures consistent evaluation and&#13;
effective co-ordination of all investment proposals under consideration.  An Information&#13;
Memorandum was completed and circulated in November 1995. The pre-bid due diligence&#13;
review of field data by potential investors has ben completed and seven investor groups have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. The Rehabilitation Progran                                                41&#13;
expressed strong interest in submitting bids for participation in the field rehabilitation program.&#13;
The bidding process is expected to be completed by end-July 1996.&#13;
5.20   Organizational and Institutional Strengthening. Through its analytical support to the&#13;
Government and Uzenmunaigas, the Bank has played a pivotal role in the mapping and&#13;
implementation of the actions, enumerated in Chapter 4, to strengthen the organization of&#13;
Uzenmunaigas, commercialize its operations and private its operations.&#13;
5.21   With a comprehensive package of activities designed to strengthen the management of&#13;
Uzenmunaigas and to support its effective promotion to potential extemal investors firmly in&#13;
place, the Government's major concem now is to avoid further and economically costly decline&#13;
in production and deterioration in the condition of the field while the package of activities is&#13;
being implemented and before any significant foreign investment inflows materialize.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
6.1   The main objectives of the project are to: (i) help reduce the rate of decline in oil&#13;
production and generate resources for reinvestment in the Uzen field's operations; (ii) promote&#13;
the reorganization of Uzenmunaigas into commercially viable corporate units and its/their&#13;
privatization; (iii) assist Uzenmunaigas in assessing the impact of past operating practices on the&#13;
present condition of the reservoirs, wells and the environment of the field; (iv) contribute to the&#13;
remediation of past environmental damage to the field and to the strengthening of Uzenmunaigas'&#13;
environmental monitoring and management systems and capacity; and (v) train Uzenmunaigas'&#13;
staff in modem oil field operating practices and strengthen the organization's capacity to manage&#13;
the implementation of the rehabilitation program and oil field operations.&#13;
6.2   Key indicators of the achievement of the project objectives, as well as specific interim&#13;
operating and financial performance targets which will serve as milestones towards the&#13;
realization of the objectives, are shown at Annex 6.13. During negotiation, agreement was&#13;
reached with the Borrower that it shall maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it&#13;
to monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators, satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, the carrying out of the project and the achievement of its objectives.&#13;
B.   THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PROJECT TO THE REHABILITATION PROGRAM&#13;
6.3   The proposed program for the restoration of the production capacity of the Uzen field&#13;
consists of an integrated package of measures covering: (i) a rehabilitation investment program;&#13;
(ii) a program of restructuring, reorganization and privatization of Uzenmunaigas; and (iii) a&#13;
program for the attraction of strategic equity investors in Uzenmunaigas' oil-producing&#13;
operations. The proposed project will continue the Bank's role in assisting the Government to&#13;
design and implement these programs. Additional Bank support in the implementation of the&#13;
above package of measures is being provided under the Petroleum Technical Assistance Project&#13;
and through the selective use of Bank-administered bilateral trust funds.&#13;
6.4   The investment components of the project would cover about 12% of the estimated&#13;
investment cost of the rehabilitation program and will provide early support to Uzenmunaigas&#13;
in: (i) clarifying the production risks and determining the production potential of the field; and&#13;
(ii) stemming the rate of production decline and deterioration in the condition of the field. In&#13;
addition, the project would provide assistance to Uzenmunaigas in developing and implementing&#13;
the management infrastructure and capability required to operate the field efficiently and&#13;
commercially.&#13;
6.5   The sequencing of the project with other, albeit uncertain, investment activities that may&#13;
result from the on-going search for private equity investors raises a number of issues about the&#13;
consistency of possible different approaches to the rehabilitation of the field. These issues have&#13;
been addressed satisfactorily. In particular, the following actions have been taken:&#13;
First, Uzenmunaigas, with the assistance of legal and financial consultants, has prepared&#13;
model agreements and investment strategies to govern the technical and financial basis&#13;
for the participation of future investors in the rehabilitation of the field. This framework&#13;
for future investment activities is satisfactory to the Bank and would reduce the risk of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43                                                                   VI. The Project&#13;
inconsistent approaches to the future rehabilitation of the field as well as the adoption of&#13;
investment policies that would seriously hamper the ability to attract significant potential&#13;
investors. During negotiations, agreement was reached with Uzenmunaigas that it shall&#13;
take all measures necessary, with respect to monitoring and evaluation activities&#13;
performed in accordance with indicators, satisfactory to the Bank, to achieve the most&#13;
economically effective development of the Uzen oil field and ensure the most complete&#13;
extraction of its reserves, including: (a) the development of the whole of the Uzen oil&#13;
field on the basis of a single, coordinated strategy to be devised by a single central&#13;
management; and (b) all future contractual arrangements regarding the development of&#13;
the Uzen oil field to be made on the basis of this strategy.&#13;
Second, in order to minimize the possibility of conflict with the choices that might be&#13;
made by future investors in the field, appropriate safeguards have been taken with respect&#13;
to the choice of technologies and operating practices and the scale, flexibility and timing&#13;
of investments under the project. The technologies and practices proposed to be adopted&#13;
under the project are based on proven international oil field practices. Investments in&#13;
field infrastructure, which are potentially irreversible and could become a source of large&#13;
fixed costs and financial risks for Uzenmunaigas, are limited to what is necessary to&#13;
support efficient production and processing and to arresting further environmental&#13;
damage to the project area.&#13;
Third, to minimize the risk of uneconomic investments under the project, no investment&#13;
in the field would be undertaken until the production potential of the wells in selected&#13;
blocks throughout the field has been assessed through a well-structured program of&#13;
physical testing of a representative sample of wells.&#13;
Finally, implementation arrangements are consistent with full participation in the&#13;
management of the field as a whole, including the implementation of the project, by&#13;
potential equity investors in the field. In particular, the schedule for the organized search&#13;
for long-term operating partners and the implementation plan for the project are such that&#13;
potential equity investors are expected to be identified substantially in advance of the&#13;
completion of a project workover plan and the completion of the final bidding documents&#13;
for the field processing facilities.&#13;

6.7   The following presents a detailed description of the project components.&#13;
a.    Physical Investments&#13;
(1) Subsurface Rehabilitanion&#13;
6.8   During appraisal, agreement was reached with Uzenmunaigas that the focus of the&#13;
proposed project would be on the rehabilitation of wells and surface production and water&#13;
injection facilities in selected water injection blocks in the field and associated surface facilities.&#13;
The project area would be selected on the basis of the potential for a large and rapid increase&#13;
in production and for an early contribution to the cash generating capacity of Uzenmunaigas.&#13;
The geographical concentration of the selected welUs in preference to their dispersal over the&#13;
field would also allow for the optimization of investments in the rehabilitation of surface&#13;
facilities.&#13;
6.9   One block (Block 3A) out of 16 injection blocks in the field was selected during appraisal&#13;
for inclusion in the project. During appraisal, Block 3A was confirmed as having one of the&#13;
most promising reservoir characteristics in the field. The original oil in place in the six&#13;
formations (oil bearing layers) in Block 3A has been estimated by independent consultants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45                                                                   VI. The Project&#13;
engaged by the Bank at 118 million tons (885 million barrels). To date, cumulative production&#13;
from the block amounts to about 28 million tons (210 million barrels). The technically&#13;
recoverable remaining reserves in the block, based on extrapolations of the past pattern of&#13;
production decline under good operating conditions, is estimated at about 7 million tons (52&#13;
million barrels). An analysis of the operating status of the wells in Block 3A (as of June 1995)&#13;
is provided at Annex 6.1. Block 3A contains a total of 340 producer wells and 138 injector&#13;
wells. As of June 1995, 203 (60%) of producer wells were on production. Total average daily&#13;
oil production from the active producer wells is currently about 6.0 tons per well.&#13;
6.10  The inclusion of Block 3A in the project would be confimed after the completion of a&#13;
program of well-testing and additional reservoir engineering analysis to determine whether, given&#13;
the present condition of its wells and the formations, its comprehensive rehabilitation is&#13;
financially attractive. Agreement was reached with Uzenmunaigas during appraisal that, subject&#13;
to the results of this further evaluation, the workover of about 250 wells in Block 3A would be&#13;
financed under the project. A balance of about 150 wells would be selected for workover from&#13;
another block. The second block would be selected based on the results of reservoir engineering&#13;
studies and wells tests in the rest of the field.&#13;
6.11  The project provides for the procurement of equipment and parts for the workover of&#13;
about 400 producing wells and about 100 injector wells. A preliminary list of requirements has&#13;
been determined by consultants based on the replacement of all production tubing, sucker rods,&#13;
bottom hole pumps, polished rod yokes and polished rods in the producer wells to be&#13;
rehabilitated. For the injector wells, the project will provide for the full replacement of tubing&#13;
in all the wells to be included in the project. The project will also provide for the procurement&#13;
and installation of chemical dosage pumps and piping for the injection of pour-point depressants&#13;
into producer wells and an initial stock of chemicals equal to about six months of requirement&#13;
per rehabilitated producing well. During the project period, Uzenmunaigas will finance, out of&#13;
its cashflow, the additional ongoing requirement for pour-point depressants and water injection&#13;
and fluid processing chemicals generated by the project. A statement of the estimated&#13;
equipment and material requirement for the project is attached as Annex 6.2.&#13;
6.12 The selection of wells for rehabilitation under the project will be in accordance with&#13;
selection criteria based on a ranking of the incremental production potential and condition of&#13;
wells and the potential financial return from the workover of individual wells. During appraisal,&#13;
agreement was reached with Uzenmunaigas that only candidate wells expected to achieve a pre-&#13;
tax rate of return of at least 20% on programmed workover expenditures would be included in&#13;
the workover program to be financed under the project. The selection criteria was confirmed&#13;
at negotiations. Agreement was also reached with Uzenmunaigas during appraisal that, in the&#13;
event that sufficient candidate wells in the pre-selected Block 3A do not meet the screening&#13;
criteria to justify the proposed complementary rehabilitation of the block's surface infrastructure,&#13;
clusters of wells meeting the criteria would be selected in other blocks. The selection of other&#13;
blocks for inclusion in the project would be based on the ranking of potential production from&#13;
the various blocks in the field based upon the findings of additional reservoir analyses and the&#13;
results of the proposed test of the condition of wells and of reservoir performance in various&#13;
parts of the field.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. The Project                                                                  46&#13;
(2)   Surface Facilities Rehabilitation&#13;
6.13 Block 3A has 14 test separators, 5 fluid gathering stations and 2 water injection pump&#13;
stations and fluid production and water injection flow lines of total length of about 205 km and&#13;
20 km respectively. The facilities are extensively deteriorated and lack adequate flow metering&#13;
and monitoring equipment to effectively manage and control operations. In their present&#13;
condition, the risk that the facilities would constrain future production from rehabilitated wells&#13;
is high. Moreover, the deficiencies in control equipment would render it difficult to efficiently&#13;
manage production from the wells rehabilitated under the project. Finally, the present design&#13;
and condition of the facilities does not allow for significant reduction of produced water in the&#13;
field, cannot support recycling back into the water injection system of any separated water and&#13;
leads to the transport of an unnecessarily large amount of fluid over long distances from the field&#13;
to the central processing facilities. The project would include the comprehensive rehabilitation&#13;
of the surface facilities in Block 3A to address these deficiencies. The main elements of the&#13;
surface facilities rehabilitation are as follows:&#13;
(i)    Replacement of about 340 flowlines of total estimated length of about 205 km&#13;
(135 km of 3 inch diameter and about 70 km of 4 inch diameter) between&#13;
production wells and gathering stations.&#13;
(ii)   Relocation of satellite and integration of the existing gathering stations into about&#13;
8 stations with test and group separators and associated flow measuring and&#13;
control equipment.&#13;
(iii)  Replacement of oil/water transfer lines between gathering stations and the existing&#13;
central processing plant and installation of new produced water transfer lines from&#13;
the new gathering stations to the water injection station in Block 3A.&#13;
(iv)   Modification of the existing processing plant to establish a dedicated process train&#13;
for crude oil produced from Block 3A.&#13;
(v)   Installation of a complete water treatment system at the water injection pump&#13;
stations in Block 3A.&#13;
(vi)   Replacement of the existing water injection pumps, high pressure water injection&#13;
lines between the water pump station and injection wells with associated flow&#13;
measurement and control equipment.&#13;
(vii)  Replacement of the high pressure water injection line system between water&#13;
injection stations and injection wells with associated flow measuring and control&#13;
equipment.&#13;
6.14 All sub-components will embody appropriate provisions for corrosion protection.&#13;
Sub-components (i) to (iii) and (v) to (vii) above constitute the most critical elements of a&#13;
possible dedicated and closed-loop system for the processing of produced fluids in the selected&#13;
block. These subcomponents also represent the least likely elements of such a system to be&#13;
redundant in the event that Uzenmunaigas continues with the present system of centralized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47                                                                 VI. The Project&#13;
processing of produced fluids. A comprehensive description of the proposed infield fluid&#13;
processing system is provided in Annex 6.3.&#13;
(3)   Environmental Protection and Remediation&#13;
6.15 The environmental protection and remediation component of the project is based on the&#13;
Environmental Protection and Mitigation Plan developed during the Enviromnental Assessment&#13;
of the project and project appraisal. The component has been designed to build upon and&#13;
strengthen the measures already taken by Uzenmunaigas to comply with existing regulations and&#13;
to prevent, minimize and mitigate adverse environmental impacts arising from oil field&#13;
operations. The approach under this project to addressing the enviromnental issues confronted&#13;
by the field consists of four facets: (i) the conduct of pilot studies and activities to assess the&#13;
extent of environmental degradation in Block 3A and to develop and implement an action plan&#13;
to clean-up the area; (ii) the generalization of the experience in Block 3A to assess the extent&#13;
of existing degradation in the rest of the field and to develop strategies to remediate such&#13;
damage; (iii) the development of a capacity within Uzenmunaigas' to measure and monitor the&#13;
environmental effects of field operations in the future; and (iv) the strengthening of&#13;
Uzenmunaigas' environmental management capacity.&#13;
6.16 Environmental Audit for Block 3A. Systematically collected and organized baseline data&#13;
on environmental conditions in the field is not available other than in a limited form generated&#13;
during the EA process. The proposed audit of Block 3A is designed to start the process of&#13;
correcting this deficiency.  The audit would quantify the degree of soil hydrocarbon&#13;
contamination, the spatial coverage of oil and sludge pits and the volume of contaminants&#13;
contained in them, and the status of the natural vegetation cover in Block 3A. The results of&#13;
the audit would provide the necessary baseline data for assessing improvements in surface&#13;
environmental conditions in the area and for developing and costing measures to effect such&#13;
improvements. The audit excludes an assessment of air-borne pollution and air quality in the&#13;
area. Air quality monitoring field-wide and in the Block 3A area is scheduled for a later period&#13;
during project implementation after the equipment necessary to undertake a full suite of air&#13;
quality analysis has been acquired (Para. 6.18 below). The project will finance about 30 man-&#13;
months of consulting services as well as support equipment and services for the performance of&#13;
the audit. Draft summary terms of reference for the audit are provided in Annex 6 4. The audit&#13;
is scheduled to be completed prior to the start of the implementation of the workover component&#13;
of the project. This will allow for the development of a clean-up program that can be&#13;
implemented in tandem with the workover of wells. The conduct of the audit under terms of&#13;
references satisfactory to the Bank would be a covenanted agreement under the project.&#13;
6.17 Pilot Oil/Sludge-Pit and Waste Clean-UP. Under this component, oil and sludge from&#13;
the storage and disposal pits in Block 3A as well as scrap steel and other waste would be&#13;
removed from Block 3A area. The clean-up will not include waste concrete or soils not heavily&#13;
contaminated by oil. Waste concrete is not an environmental concern while the transport of&#13;
large volume of soils is not a cost-effective means of dealing with other than heavily&#13;
contaminated soil. During negotiations, agreement was reached with Uzenmunaigas and the&#13;
Govermment that a Clean-up Plan for Block 3A based on the environmental audit and satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank would be prepared and submitted to the Bank and the Government (Ministry of&#13;
Ecology) no later than December 31, 1996. All recovered waste will initially be stored in a&#13;
temporary containment area within Block 3A for subsequently sorting and removal to proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. The Project                                                                 48&#13;
new waste disposal sites for the field as a whole. In addition to removing waste from the pre-&#13;
selected project area and preventing further pollution from this source, the clean-up activity&#13;
would provide documented estimates of the cost and level of effort necessary to clean-up the rest&#13;
of the field. To support this clean-up activity, the project will provide for the procurement of&#13;
a bulldozer, excavator and two dump trucks and spare parts to be used by two clean-up units to&#13;
be established by Uzenmunaigas. The crew for the units and fuel and maintenance for the&#13;
equipment will be provided by Uzenmunaigas.&#13;
6.18 Environmental Laboratories: An environmental services laboratory was established in&#13;
Aktau in 1989 by MMG to monitor oil and soil pollution and to prepare plume dispersion&#13;
models. The laboratory suffers from a lack of equipment which handicaps severely its ability&#13;
to conduct regular monitoring of the field or undertake complex analysis of pollution effects.&#13;
Much of the laboratory's monitoring is confined to hydrogen sulfide concentration in the air&#13;
around production facilities. Attempts by the laboratory to expand monitoring to cover the field&#13;
vegetation and wildlife have been prevented by lack of appropriate equipment. It would be&#13;
inefficient to duplicate some of the services and facilities this commercially autonomous&#13;
laboratory can offer Uzenmunaigas. In addition, in the short-term, Uzenmunaigas may encounter&#13;
problems in recruiting staff to maintain a fully comprehensive laboratory. Accordingly, the&#13;
project focuses on: (i) the procurement of laboratory analysis, field sampling and monitoring&#13;
equipment and computers for data management to supplement the existing laboratory's capacity&#13;
to undertake the assessment of the full range of typical oil field environmental parameters; and&#13;
(ii) the establishment of a mobile field laboratory and a corrosion laboratory to undertake&#13;
continuous monitoring and analysis of conditions in the Uzen field -- a task not currently&#13;
performed by the Aktau-based laboratory. The equipment to be procured for the mobile field&#13;
laboratory would include: (i) an all-terrain truck mounted piston coring unit for sampling soil,&#13;
water, soil vapor and gas and for installing monitoring probes; (ii) meteorological stations; (iii)&#13;
ambient air monitoring trailer; and (iv) ground water sampling equipment.&#13;
6.19 Emergency Response Plan and Equipment: An emergency response plan outlining&#13;
possible accidents and incidents and the procedures to be followed was last prepared by&#13;
Uzenmunaigas predecessor in 1990 and is posted at all gathering stations and workshops.&#13;
However, the plan is not in effect. It is unclear if the plan considers all types of emergency&#13;
events associated with the field operations and whether a system for managing different&#13;
magnitudes of emergency events exists. A review of emergency response equipment at the&#13;
gathering stations undertaken during the performance of the EA indicated that available&#13;
equipment for identified fire risk is deficient with lack of self-contained airpacks, emergency&#13;
eye-booths and showers and with fire extinguisher beyond their stated date of expiration. The&#13;
project will provide consulting services for the audit of the existing emergency response plan,&#13;
the assessment of the risk of potential emergency events and the development of a&#13;
comprehensive emergency response plan. A lump sum provision of US$0.1 million has also&#13;
been made for the procurement of basic emergency response equipment. The basic equipment&#13;
requirements will be fully defined in the emergency response plan.&#13;
6.20 Development of Oil Recovery Strategies: Uzenmunaigas has achieved some success in&#13;
attracting outside firms to participate in the commercial recovery of oil from the large lakes of&#13;
oil, produced fluids and sludge in the field. The results from the work of these contractors, who&#13;
are remunerated from the proceeds from recovered and sold oil has been limited. The project&#13;
will provide for consulting services to assist Uzenmunaigas to: (i) review techniques for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49                                                                 VI. The Project&#13;
commercial oil recovery and processing in use in the international oil industry; (ii) determine&#13;
the commercial feasibility of applying such techniques to the recovery of oil and the clean-up&#13;
of oil-contaminated sites in the Uzen oil field; (iii) structure commercial terms and processes for&#13;
Uzenmunaigas to attract firms in the international oil recovery and clean-up industry to&#13;
participate in the clean-up of pools of oil in Uzen on a risk basis; (iv) identify and cost the&#13;
technical options open to Uzen for the clean-up of areas of the field for which recovery of oil&#13;
on a no-cost basis to Uzenmunaigas is not feasible; and (v) provide technical advisory support&#13;
to Uzenmunaigas in negotiating commercial oil recovery agreements. A total of 10 man-months&#13;
of consulting services has been provided for this assignment.&#13;
6.21 Revegetation Assessment: No efforts have been made in the past to restore the vegetation&#13;
destroyed by field operations.  This component will finance consulting services for the&#13;
assessment of the potential to enhance the revegetation of Uzen field. The work will entail an&#13;
overview of the ecology of the desert vegetation in this region of Kazakstan as well as a review&#13;
of revegetation studies conducted and techniques used in the region, including natural&#13;
revegetation and enhanced revegetation using seeding, transplanting, fertilizers, soil preparation&#13;
etc. The study will provide recommendations on potential revegetation techniques to be used&#13;
in the field. The component will also provides for the fmancing of experimental revegetation&#13;
studies in Block 3A based on the recommendations of the consultants.&#13;
6.22 Occupational Safety Assessment:. Conditions on the Uzen oil field with respect to&#13;
occupational safety and health are unsatisfactory. Safety consciousness in the field is low and&#13;
is compounded by the unsafe condition of deteriorated equipment and facilities.  As&#13;
Uzenmunaigas' financial performance has deteriorated, the provision of safety equipment and&#13;
protective clothing has become sporadic and inadequate contributing to the lowering of safety&#13;
awareness.  This sub-component will involve the audit of the safety of operating practices and&#13;
facilities, the recommendation of required changes in operating and safety procedures to meet&#13;
Kazakstan and international oil field or industrial safety standards, and the assessment of the cost&#13;
of investments to comply with minimally acceptable standards of occupational safety and health.&#13;
6.23 Environmental Technical Assistance and Training: The existing environmental&#13;
management unit in Uzenmunaigas is weak and staffed by personnel with little formal training&#13;
in environmental issues. The project will promote the development of environmental assessment&#13;
and management capacity through two broad activities: (i) periods of formal training in Uzen&#13;
and abroad in oil field environmental and health and safety practices for selected operations and&#13;
environmental staff; the training will be supplemented by periods of secondment to selected oil&#13;
companies abroad; and (ii) the development of an environmental database and information&#13;
system in Uzen and parallel training of Uzen environmental staff in maintaining the system and&#13;
generating and using data from the system to support environmental and occupational safety&#13;
management. The project will provide for the financing of consultants to: (i) work with staff&#13;
of Uzenmunaigas to develop a training program and training material for Uzen staff; (ii) to assist&#13;
in the development of an environmental management information system and training of&#13;
Uzenmunaigas staff; and (iii) to provide support to Uzenmunaigas management in developing&#13;
and implementing environmental and occupational safety protection and remediation programs&#13;
based on the studies and pilot activities undertaken under the project. To ensure that there is&#13;
a sufficiently senior focal point for environmental activities in the management structure,&#13;
agreement was reached with Uzenmunaigas during appraisal that it will appoint a senior staff&#13;
member as an Environmental Coordinator within the Project Management Group for the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. The Project                                                                 50&#13;
The Environmental Coordinator will oversee and coordinate the implementation of all&#13;
environmental and occupational safety aspects of the project and operations in Uzenmunaigas.&#13;
6.24 During negotiations, the following agreements with respect to the implementation of the&#13;
environmental components were reached with Uzenmunaigas: (i) that it will undertake and, by&#13;
March 31, 1997, complete an environmental audit of Block 3A in accordance with terms of&#13;
reference satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) that, by April 30, 1997, it will: (a) prepare a clean-up&#13;
program for Block 3A satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) allocate suitable facilities for laboratory&#13;
equipment and offices; and (iii) that it will select consultants and, by June 30, 1997, commence&#13;
the Uzen oil field-wide revegetation and occupational safety assessment and the oil recovery&#13;
study in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
b.    Physical Investment Implementation Support&#13;
(1) Well Testing and Logging Services&#13;
6.25 The available data on wells performance is limited and unreliable. Most wells in the field&#13;
are not metered and the reliability of readings from metered wells is low. Similarly, a large&#13;
proportion of meters at test separators are defective or unreliable. Fluid and oil allocation back&#13;
to individual wells is highly arbitrary. Well bottom-flowing and shut-in pressures are unknown&#13;
and water injection volumes in target zones are highly questionable. The lack of reliable data&#13;
would make programming of workover and re-completion operations difficult. It would also&#13;
render the assessment of returns on future rehabilitation investments difficult and increase the&#13;
perceived risk of such investments. The project will provide for the two-stage testing and&#13;
logging of producer and injector wells. The tests are designed to reduce the risks of the project&#13;
by allowing a better determination of the production potential of the wells and selected&#13;
formations in Blocks 3A and other areas of the field and the required scope and cost of&#13;
workovers. The first stage will entail the procurement of well testing services for the testing&#13;
of a sample of about 400 producer wells in Block 3A and in adjacent and other selected blocks&#13;
field-wide. The proposed testing program will use coiled oil tubing units, hot oil trucks and&#13;
associated equipment to determine, inter alia, current actual well productivity for the sample of&#13;
wells, the incremental productivity that can be expected after the clean-out and workover of&#13;
wells and the operational requirements for sustaining future production from the sample wells.&#13;
The results of the tests would be used as a basis for the formulation of the project workover&#13;
program. The tests would provide an important additional but incidental benefit: the tests&#13;
involve the cleaning-out of wells and, in some cases, this would suffice to increase sustainable&#13;
well production and defer the need for more comprehensive workovers. Details of the proposed&#13;
testing program are provided in Annex 6.5. During negotiation, agreement was reached with&#13;
Uzenmunaigas that no well workover would be undertaken under the project prior to the&#13;
availability of results from the well testing program and the development of a well workover plan&#13;
based on the results of such a program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51                                                                 VI. The Project&#13;
6.26 Subsequent to the selection of candidate wells for workover, it is proposed to undertake&#13;
a series of tests (logs) on all selected producer and injector wells to determine the integrity of&#13;
the wells, the need for and scope of re-perforation of wells and the need for re-completion in&#13;
different formations or stimulation of producing formations. The second-stage testing program&#13;
would proceed sequentially with the implementation of the workover and would require the hire&#13;
of a logging suite and associated services for the duration of the workover implementation&#13;
period.&#13;
(2) Workover Contractors&#13;
6.27 The project will provide for the hiring of a workover contractor for a total of about 2800&#13;
rig-days to undertake the workover program. The services of the contractor would include&#13;
provision of operated rigs, tools and all logistical services for the performance of the workovers.&#13;
Selected operating staff will be drawn, at the option of the selected contractor, from suitably&#13;
qualified employees of Uzenmunaigas. The expected scope of the contractor's services is&#13;
detailed in Annex 6.6. The scope of work will be suitably revised once the well-testing and&#13;
related reservoir engineering studies are sufficiently advanced to enable a better definition of the&#13;
rehabilitation requirements of producer wells.&#13;
(3) Project Management Servces and Support&#13;
6.28 Uzenmunaigas has created a Project and Production Management Group (PMG) to&#13;
undertake three functions: (i) implement the project; (ii) provide reservoir engineering and&#13;
management services for the field as a whole; and (iii) support Uzenmunaigas management in&#13;
the technical evaluation and administration of joint-venture or operating agreements, service&#13;
contracts and other forms of external operating and financial participation in production activities&#13;
in Uzen. The PMG is an organizational unit of Uzenmunaigas reporting to the general director.&#13;
It would be independent of any outside operating partner in the Uzen oil field. However,&#13;
depending on the structure of future investment agreements, the PMG staff could serve as the&#13;
technical representative of Uzenmunaigas on a joint operating committee or similar field&#13;
management structure.&#13;
6.29 In its project implementation role, the PMG would be responsible for project planning&#13;
and scheduling, resources budgeting (including coordination of the resources requirement of the&#13;
project and other on-going field maintenance and rehabilitation activities), procurement,&#13;
monitoring and control of project implementation and production activities; and the formulation&#13;
and implementation of a training and long-term institutional-building program. In its reservoir&#13;
management and investment administration role, the PMG would manage the conduct of reserve&#13;
audits for all reservoirs and in-depth reservoir studies for selected reservoirs; provide various&#13;
production scenarios as directed by Uzenmunaigas management for selected reservoirs; review&#13;
proposed participation agreements and service contracts and contribute to the evaluation of assets&#13;
to be covered by such agreements; participate in the development and review of proposed work&#13;
plans for workovers and other rehabilitation activities; and provide policy and operational&#13;
guidelines for the optimal exploitation of reserves under proposed or existing projects and&#13;
investment agreements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. The Project                                                                 52&#13;
6.30 The organizational structure of the PMG provides for five executive staff, headed by a&#13;
Project Director. The Project Director has overall responsibility for: (a) monitoring the rate&#13;
of progress in project implementation, both physical and financial; (b) the resolution of conflicts,&#13;
particularly in the requirement of inputs for the project; (c) initiation and review of course-&#13;
correction actions for the individual components of the project and the project as a whole; and&#13;
(d) overall quality control in the execution of project activities. The Project Director would also&#13;
be the focal point in Uzenmunaigas for the administration of all foreign investment agreements&#13;
and will be responsible for the development, approval and monitoring of operating and&#13;
investment plans for the field as a whole. The Project Director would be supported by: (i) a&#13;
technical manager who would also serve as the Deputy Project Director; (ii) an administrative&#13;
and finance manager; (iii) an environmental services coordinator; and (iv) a supplies manager.&#13;
A chart of the PMG organizational structure is attached as Chart 3. The scope of work of the&#13;
PMG is provided in Annex 6. 7.&#13;
6.31 Uzenimunaigas will need external assistance to staff and provide technical support to the&#13;
PMG. The external staff would: (i) fill the gaps in Uzenmunaigas' technical capacity; (ii)&#13;
relieve functional management in Uzenmunaigas of detailed involvement in the task of planning,&#13;
monitoring and controlling the technical aspects of the project in order to concentrate on the day-&#13;
to-day management of operations; and (iii) train or organize training for Uzenmunaigas staff in&#13;
new technical and commercial management and operating practices. The project will provide&#13;
for five forms of assistance to the PMG: (a) support for systems development for project&#13;
management and administration; (b) substitutional management support; (c) operational support&#13;
for project implementation; (d) training; and (e) office equipment and transport vehicles. The&#13;
recruitment of consultants, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to provide technical&#13;
and management support to Uzenmunaigas in the implementation of the project and the&#13;
management of operations in the field is a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
6.32 Systems Development Support: The proposed project provides for about 15 man-months&#13;
of consulting services and technical assistance to develop, implement and train Uzenmunaigas&#13;
staff in the operation of the following systems for the PMG: project scheduling and monitoring&#13;
systems; project cost budgeting and control systems; procurement systems and procedures;&#13;
financial and operating reporting systems to conform  to requirements of the Bank and&#13;
Uzenmunaigas; and administrative systems.&#13;
6.33  Substitutional Management Support: During project preparation, Uzenmunaigas indicated&#13;
that it does not have adequately qualified or experienced staff familiar with: modem project&#13;
management concepts; Bank procurement procedures and commercial procurement strategies and&#13;
practices in the international oil industry; international generally accepted accounting principles&#13;
and policies; and advanced technical and management practices in mature, water flooding&#13;
operations. Accordingly, the proposed project will provide for the engagement of external staff&#13;
to fill the executive positions in the PMG of the supplies manager, and the Deputy Project&#13;
Director and technical manager. In addition, to provide support to the Administrative and&#13;
Finance Manager of the PMG, the project will finance the cost of the services of a project&#13;
accountant and a project management systems and performance analyst. These specialists would&#13;
assist in the implementation of systems and procedures for project cost budgeting, accounting&#13;
and scheduling and for the monitoring of project performance. The total provision for this sub-&#13;
component is about 50 man-months of services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53                                                                   VI. The Project&#13;
6.34 Operational Support: The project will provide for about 200 man-months of the service&#13;
of specialists to assist in planning and overseeing the implementation of the individual investment&#13;
components of the project and to provide reservoir management services for the project and&#13;
other areas of the field as designated by Uzenmunaigas. The operations support team would be&#13;
expected to help the PMG to manage the introduction of changes in operational systems,&#13;
procedures and supervisory practices in the field required to support the efficient operations and&#13;
the effective utilization of the assets and types of services to be financed under the project. To&#13;
identify required changes in systems and practices, the PMG Operations Support Group would,&#13;
at the inception of its work, prepare an Operations Improvement Plan (OIP) based on a detailed&#13;
audit of all oil production activities and related operations information management systems and&#13;
field supervision practices.  The operations support team  would comprise a workover&#13;
specialist/production engineer, a reservoir engineer, a developmental geologist, a production&#13;
engineer specializing in surface production facilities, four workover superintendents and a&#13;
surface facilities superintendent.  The team would be organized into two units with the&#13;
superintendents supervising the implementation of project activities and field production&#13;
operations and the rest of the team responsible for project planning and control and reservoir and&#13;
production management. In addition, to support the activities of the team, a lump-sum provision&#13;
(US$1.5 million) has been made to be utilized for short-term and specific operational, reservoir&#13;
engineering and preliminary engineering and design studies, the need for which might arise both&#13;
in the course of the planning and execution of the project components and in support of the&#13;
appraisal of proposed investments in the field by external operators.&#13;
6.35  Training:  Given the pressing demands of operational activities and Uzemnunaigas'&#13;
deteriorating financial situation, investment in training resources and facilities and in the&#13;
provision of training has received increasingly low priority in Uzenmunaigas and, prior to its&#13;
reorganization, Uzenneft. At its peak, the activities of the training center at Uzenneft (owned&#13;
and managed by MMG prior to the recent reorganization) included the training of 1500 new&#13;
entrants per year on courses of four to five months in duration and the delivery of about 40&#13;
professional programs to junior and senior staff. The activities of the training center have&#13;
dwindled substantially, leaving only nine instructors and obsolete technical instruction tools.&#13;
There are currently few institutionalized programs for training staff who are not new entrants.&#13;
As a result, old practices based on training acquired in the past and no longer relevant to current&#13;
operating conditions continue to dominate, adversely affecting performance in virtually all areas&#13;
of the organization.&#13;
6.36 The proposed approach to training under the project is as follows: (i) tie new training&#13;
initiatives at the professional and artisan level to the operating and maintenance requirements of&#13;
new investments and the immediate functional needs of changing institutional and organizational&#13;
arrangements in Uzenmunaigas; whilst (ii) exposing selected senior managers to management&#13;
practices in the international oil industry to sensitize them to the need for change and the role&#13;
of management and staff training in this process. Provision will be made under the project for:&#13;
(a) a lump-sum-provision (US$0.5 million) to cover project "start-up" activities such as training&#13;
in project management techniques, procurement procedures, selected computer application&#13;
programs, etc.; (b) two (2) man-months of consulting services to assess evolving training needs,&#13;
the capacity of Uzenmunaigas to perform such training and the requirement for trainers and their&#13;
training needs; (c) a budget to cover part of the costs of training trainers abroad in selected&#13;
operating, maintenance and commercial areas; (d) start-up costs of developing curricula and&#13;
training material; and (e) the financing of a program of secondments and fellowships to oil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. The Project                                                               54&#13;
companies and institutions abroad.  During negotiatlions, agreement was reached with&#13;
Uzenmunaigas that, as a condition precedent for disbursement of the other sub-components of&#13;
the training component, it will undertake a training needs assessment and develop, adopt and&#13;
implement a training strategy, satisfactory to the Bank, to address the provision of the identified&#13;
training needs on a sustained basis.&#13;
6.37 Office Support. A small fleet of vehicles (6), telecommunications equipment and personal&#13;
computers (6) and other basic office equipment for use by the PMG would be financed under&#13;
the project. The vehicles will be light all wheel drive trucks equipped with tools for the&#13;
performance of minor repairs on wells and flow lines. A provision of about US$0.4 million has&#13;
been made for these items.&#13;
c.    Organizational Development Support&#13;
(1) Financial Management Support&#13;
6.38 The diagnostic study of Uzenmunaigas' accounting systems and policies, undertaken by&#13;
E&amp;Y, has identified serious shortcomings in the organization of the accounting function and&#13;
financial and management accounting practices. To address these shortcomings, the consultants&#13;
have developed a plan of action, satisfactory to Uzenmunaigas and the Bank, covering the&#13;
following areas: (i) the reduction in the duplication of accounting entries and inconsistencies in&#13;
accounting policies in the organization by centralizing key accounting subsystems such as&#13;
accounts payable and receivables, payroll, fixed assets, and control of the sales and general&#13;
ledger functions; (ii) 'he development of uniform accounting policies and procedures manuals;&#13;
(iii) the strengthening of internal control procedures; (iv) the implementation of recommended&#13;
procedures for adjusting the statutory Kazakstan accounts to conform to international accounting&#13;
standards; (v) the implementation of a rationalized revised chart of accounts; (vi) the&#13;
implementation of a management accounting system based on business units and activity centers&#13;
defmed under the Uzenmunaigas Restructuring Plan; and (vii) the development and&#13;
implementation of operational budgeting and budgetary control procedures. The project would&#13;
fmance about 50 man-months of technical assistance in the form of consulting and advisory&#13;
services and training to help implement the recommended restructuring and revamping of&#13;
Uzenmunaigas' accounting system and to assist Uzenmunaigas to develop corporate and&#13;
municipal financial planning systems and procedures.&#13;
(2) Information Systems&#13;
6.39 Accounting Information System. A limited number of computers are available within&#13;
selected accounting groups in Uzenmunaigas but only the payroll and material inventory&#13;
accounting subsystems are partially computerized.  However, even these computerized&#13;
subsystems are non-operational for three reasons: (i) the software are not current with the many&#13;
changes in related legislation (in the case of the payroll system) and Uzenmunaigas does not have&#13;
the capacity to modify them; (ii) the software  are inconsistent with Uzenmunaigas'&#13;
requirements; and (iii) Uzenmunaigas does not have enough staff capable of operating the&#13;
systems. Timeliness of routine manual processing of accounts to meet the generally stringent&#13;
statutory deadlines is acceptable. However, the absence of computerization in the organization,&#13;
even on a stand alone decision-support basis, imposes an enormous cost on Uzenmunaigas both&#13;
in terms of the clerical effort required to produce analytical reports and, more importantly,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55                                                                   VI. The Project&#13;
through the avoidance or impossibility of the production of such reports at all and the adverse&#13;
impact of this on the ability to make effective operating or commercial decisions. The project&#13;
provides for the procurement of computers and software (about US$0.5 million) for the&#13;
implementation of a systems development plan to be formulated by the financial management&#13;
consultants following the restructuring of Uzenmunaigas and the redistribution of accounting&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
6.40 Reservoir Management System. Until the restructuring of Uzenneft in November 1995,&#13;
the analysis of day-to-day fluid and oil production and the stipulation of operating policies based&#13;
on such analysis was undertaken by MMG. The system for data capture in the oil field is based&#13;
on unreliable mechanical instrumentation and data compilation is manual and prone to error.&#13;
Limitations on telecommunications facilities delay data transmittal and manipulation. More&#13;
importantly, since the restructuring, Uzenmunaigas has lost access to the computer facilities and&#13;
skills to manage and use effectively critical current and historic reservoir and production&#13;
information. The project would contribute to developing the information basis for effective&#13;
production and reservoir management. The project provides for efficient and reliable forms for&#13;
monitoring of project production facilities. This would be supplemented by the provision of&#13;
computers and software for analysis, by the PMG support team, of production for the field,&#13;
telecommunication links between the field data organization facilities and the headquarters of the&#13;
PMG, and related training for selected Uzenmunaigas staff. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached with Uzenmunaigas that it will undertake and complete, by March 31, 1997, a study,&#13;
in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, to determine the most cost-&#13;
effective and efficient configuration of the telecommunications and computer systems to be&#13;
financed under the project to meet the short-term needs of and long-term prospects for the Uzen&#13;
Oil Field.&#13;
D.   COST ESTIMATES&#13;
6.41  The total project costs, including price and physical contingencies, are estimated at&#13;
US$136 million, with an estimated foreign cost of US$109 million or about 80% of total cost.&#13;
A summary of the project costs is shown in the table below. Detailed project costs are given&#13;
in Annex 6. 8.&#13;
6.42 The estimated project costs include the cost of de-waxing chemicals required during the&#13;
project start-up period i.e. prior to the completion of the rehabilitation of wells and related&#13;
infrastructure and the build-up of production to the peak expected level. Other incremental&#13;
operating costs associated with the project and the build-up of production levels are not expected&#13;
to be material.&#13;
6.43   In accordance with current Government policy, it is assumed that foreign consulting and&#13;
technical assistance personnel financed under the project will not be subject to domestic income&#13;
taxes on remuneration financed by the Bank.  This tax treatment was confirmed during&#13;
negotiations. It is the present policy of the Government to exempt the import of equipment and&#13;
materials for major projects from import duties. However, for purposes of the project cost&#13;
estimates, it is assumed that import duties are payable by Uzenmunaigas for the import of&#13;
equipment and materials financed under the project at the average currently applicable rate of&#13;
6% of the cif value of such imports. This treatment is conservative. The total estimated duty&#13;
on imports is US$2.0 million. The import of equipment and materials (and associated local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. The Project                                                                      56&#13;
costs) would be subject to VAT. However, the net incremental VAT liability arising from the&#13;
project is expected to be zero since all VAT payments on project inputs are fully creditable&#13;
against VAT liability on sales and all excess VAT payments on inputs over VAT liability on&#13;
sales are fully reimbursable. There is however, the risk that Uzenmunaigas' cash flow may be&#13;
adversely affected by untimely reimbursement of excess VAT or inadequate accounting and&#13;
submission of VAT returns. Uzenmunaigas is aware of the risks, and project implementation&#13;
arrangements have been designed to ensure that Uzenmunaigas has adequate control over these&#13;
risks. Other taxes on local costs are expected to be negligible.&#13;
6.44 Physical contingencies of 15% have been applied to all project components, except for&#13;
the surface rehabilitation component for which the applied rate is 20%. Price escalation&#13;
adjustments based on the Bank's projection of the index of manufacturers unit value (muv), as&#13;
at May 1995, have been applied to the cost of all imported goods and services. Local costs,&#13;
consisting predominantly of local non-tradeable goods and services, have been escalated at 15 %&#13;
per annum (para 7.17). The total project costs are estimated based on an overall implementation&#13;
period of four years.&#13;
6.45 The cost estimates are based on the following: (a) well testing and logging services:&#13;
quotations received from major international wells service companies on the envisaged scope of&#13;
work; (b) workover services: recent rates for similar services in the FSU, adjusted for recent&#13;
trends in rates in other major rigs markets; (c) surface rehabilitation: based on unit costs for&#13;
equipment, material and services derived from recent Bank project experience; and (d) technical&#13;
assistance and consulting services: actual man-month rates for similar services in the region.&#13;

6.47 The procurement procedures for the Bank-financed components are detailed below.&#13;
(a)    Goods: Equipment and parts for the workover of wells will be procured as one&#13;
lot under Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures under the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines (January 1995) for procurement of goods and works, and using the&#13;
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for the Procurement of Goods (January&#13;
1.   The methods of procurement under this column include: (a) international shopping for information&#13;
systems and office equipment on the basis of individual packages not to exceed US$200,000 up to an&#13;
aggregate value of US$1.9 million or national shopping for the same category of goods on the basis of&#13;
individual packages not to exceed US$10,000 up to an aggregate value of US$100,000; (b) selection of&#13;
consultants (US$26.3 million) according to the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. The Project                                                               58&#13;
1995). A small number of major petrochemical companies produce wax&#13;
suppressing chemicals for oil field, oil pipeline and oil refmery applications.&#13;
However, the effectiveness of the different brands of wax suppressant varies&#13;
significantly depending on the specific properties of the wax. Uzemnunaigas has&#13;
had favorable results in the past with the use of one brand. The determination&#13;
of the effectiveness of other brands in the market on Uzen crude oil would&#13;
require laboratory testing and study. It is proposed that wax suppressants be&#13;
procured on the basis of LIB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines (January&#13;
1995) with the list of bidders to be drawn from all qualified suppliers determined&#13;
through laboratory testing of purchased samples of wax suppressing chemicals.&#13;
The list of qualified bidders should be broad enough to ensure competition and&#13;
should be acceptable to the Bank. Other chemicals such as de-emulsifiers,&#13;
corrosion and scale inhibitors and biocides that are proposed to be procured under&#13;
the project are of a commodity nature and are not generally site-specific. These&#13;
chemicals would be procured through ICB in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines (January 1995) using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for the&#13;
Procurement of Goods (January 1995). Laboratory and analytical equipment for&#13;
the testing and analysis of air, soil, water and produced fluid quality and&#13;
composition as well as for the assessment of the chemical or physical composition&#13;
of other environmental pollutants will be procured as one lot through ICB in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines (January 1995) using the Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Document for the Procurement of Goods (January 1995). Office and&#13;
telecommunications equipment in individual packages not to exceed US$200,000&#13;
and up to an aggregate amount of US$1.9 million would be procured through&#13;
International Shopping based on the comparison of price quotations obtained from&#13;
at least three suppliers from at least two different eligible countries, and in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines (January 1995) for the procurement of&#13;
goods and works. Items or groups of items of sundry or smaller office&#13;
equipment such as photocopiers, facsimile machines etc., estimated to cost&#13;
US$10,000 or less per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000&#13;
equivalent, may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison&#13;
of price quotations from at least three suppliers eligible under the guidelines, in&#13;
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Training equipment and&#13;
material and motor vehicles would each be procured as one lot under ICB in line&#13;
with the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for the Procurement of Goods&#13;
(January 1995).&#13;
(b)   Works: The rehabilitation of the surface facilities to be financed under the project&#13;
would be awarded on the basis of ICB, under the Bank's guidelines, on a lump-&#13;
sum engineering, procurement and construction basis. Bidding documents&#13;
suitable for this type of services, acceptable to the Bank, would be used following&#13;
a pre-qualification of contractors using the Bank's Standard Pre-qualification&#13;
Document.&#13;
(c)    Technical Services: The testing, logging and recompletion of wells are highly&#13;
specialized services provided by a small number of firms internationally. The&#13;
contract workover of wells is an international business with a large number and&#13;
good geographic spread of firms. Owing to the significantly earlier requirement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59                                                                   VI. The Project&#13;
for wells testing services, it is proposed to award the contract for these services&#13;
as one lot under LIB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines (January 1995).&#13;
To minimize coordination problems and consequential delays and costs during the&#13;
workover of wells, the contract for the performance of logging and completion&#13;
services and for the workover of wells will be awarded as one lot to an alliance&#13;
of a rigs service operator and a wells service company selected through ICB in&#13;
line with the Bank's Guidelines (January 1995). The rigs services operator will&#13;
be the primary contractor. The wells service firms eligible for inclusion in any&#13;
bidding alliance will be pre-selected by Uzenmunaigas and will include all wells&#13;
service providers with demonstrated international experience in furnishing the&#13;
services required under the project. Bidding alliances will be pre-qualified based&#13;
on their financial position and their experience and past performance on similar&#13;
contracts. Bidding documents suitable for this type of services, acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, would be used. The Bank's Standard Pre-qualification Document would&#13;
be used in the pre-qualification of the bidding alliances.&#13;
(d)    Technical &amp; Management Know How: Specialists to be engaged to fill executive&#13;
positions in the PMG, provide ancillary technical consulting services and&#13;
operational support for the implementation of the project and implement the&#13;
training component of the project are proposed to be recruited as a team from one&#13;
firm. The firm would be selected from a short list of firms in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (1981). The short-list of firms&#13;
would consist of consulting firms with demonstrated and extensive prior&#13;
experience in providing: (i) reservoir management services; (ii) the management&#13;
of oil field rehabilitation projects; (iii) advising management on technical,&#13;
managerial and corporate policy issues; and (iv) the conduct of technical and&#13;
economic studies in the oil industry. Contracts for consulting services for the&#13;
development and implementation of financial and management accounting systems&#13;
and for the environmental component will be awarded in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants. All enviromnental technical assistance&#13;
and consulting services would be awarded as one contract to one firm selected&#13;
from a short list of specialized environmental consulting and management services&#13;
firms with demonstrated experience in the oil industry. The selection procedures&#13;
will be in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the use of Consultants&#13;
(1981).&#13;
6.48 At present, it is not certain that manufacturers which can supply API-certified (or&#13;
equivalent) oil field equipment and parts or that can supply motor vehicles and training&#13;
equipment, meeting the specifications required under the project, exist in Kazakstan.&#13;
Nonetheless, the tender documents for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) under the project&#13;
will include the Bank's standard domestic preference provisions for the procurement of goods.&#13;
This would allow eligible and qualified Kazakstan manufacturers to benefit from such&#13;
preference, should they submit bids.&#13;
6.49  Contract Reiew: The likely contracts under the project and their expected timing are&#13;
shown at Annex 6.9. All packages for procurement under ICB and LIB as well as the first&#13;
contract proposed to be awarded under International Shopping would be subject to the Bank's&#13;
prior review of procurement documentation, resulting in the coverage of about 95 % of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. The Project                                                               60&#13;
estimated value of all such contracts. The balance of packages would be subject to random post-&#13;
review by the Bank after contract award. In the case of consultant's services, all contracts&#13;
above US$100,000 would be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation.&#13;
In addition, and irrespective of the contract value, the following would be subject to prior Bank&#13;
review and approval: (i) all terms of reference for all consultant contracts; (ii) all procurement&#13;
documentation for contracts for assignments judged to be of a critical nature by the Bank; and&#13;
(iii) amendments of contracts raising the contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or above for&#13;
consultants services and above US$200,000 for goods procured through International Shopping.&#13;
F.   INSURANCE&#13;
6.50 Uzenmunaigas does not carry any fire, theft, catastrophe, business interruption or liability&#13;
insurance. Prior to the reorganization of MMG, insurance against these risks was provided&#13;
through pooled reserves maintained by MMG and, effectively, underpinned by Munaigas and&#13;
the resources of other enterprises in the industry.  With the restructuring of MMG,&#13;
corporatization of the industry and the moves towards privatization of the constituent entities of&#13;
Munaigas, the burden of insurance has been fully shifted to Uzenmunaigas. Uzenmunaigas has&#13;
no reserves against these risks and the near-term prospects for accumulating sufficient reserves&#13;
against such risks are poor. During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the Government&#13;
that it will cause Uzenmunaigas to maintain adequate insurance from third parties against the&#13;
risk of fire, theft and catastrophe related to the assets and actvities to be financed under the&#13;
project. Insurance coverage, satisfactory to the Bank, for the construction of the oil processing&#13;
facilities, the workover of wells, the performance of other technical services and consulting&#13;
services and the transportation of goods financed under the project would be stipulated in the&#13;
bidding documents.&#13;
G.   FINANCING PLAN&#13;
6.51 The proposed Bank loan of US$109 million would finance 80% of total project costs&#13;
(para 6.41) and 100% of foreign costs. Uzenmunaigas would finance: (i) all taxes and duties&#13;
imposed on the procurement of goods and services; and (ii) all local costs of goods and services,&#13;
other than the services of local consultants selected pursuant to competitive procedures in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the selection of consultants. Uzenmunaigas has&#13;
negotiated a line of credit of US$5.0 million per annum for two years with the Export-Import&#13;
Bank of Kazakstan to cover part of the anticipated local cost component in each of the first two&#13;
years of the proposed project.&#13;
6.52 It is proposed that the Bank loan be made to the Government for on-lending to&#13;
Uzenmunaigas. A schematic diagram of the proposed legal structure governing the proposed&#13;
loan is provided at Chart 4. The proposed on-lending terms of the Bank loan are as follows:&#13;
US dollar denominated basis for 12 years, including a four-year grace period on principal&#13;
repayments, at a variable interest rate based on the interest rate on the Bank loan plus a margin&#13;
of 200 basis points to cover the Government's administration costs and its exposure to default&#13;
and cross-currency exchange risks. The US dollar exchange rate risk would be borne by&#13;
Uzenmunaigas. In the event that, prior to or after the execution of a subsidiary loan agreement,&#13;
the Government seeks and obtains from Uzenmunaigas arrangements to further reduce its risk&#13;
exposure, the proposed margin over the Bank rate may be appropriately readjusted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61                                                                VI. The Project&#13;
6.53 It is a condition of effectiveness that the subsidiary loan agreement has been duly&#13;
authorized or ratified by the Borrower and Uzenmunaigas and is legally binding upon the&#13;
Borrower and Uzenmunaigas in accordance with its terms.&#13;
H.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
6.54 The modalities for management of project implementation are outlined in paras 6.28 to&#13;
6.31 above. The project implementation schedule is shown at Annex 6.10. The major&#13;
implementation risks relating to Uzenmunaigas' unfamiliarity with Bank procurement procedures&#13;
and financial reporting requirement, technical capacity to implement part of the project and its&#13;
capacity to finance local costs of the project are addressed under the proposed implementation&#13;
arrangements and financing plan. The proposed measures to ameliorate the above implementation&#13;
risks are adequate. A Prime Ministerial Decree (210-P3) provides a satisfactory framework for&#13;
the relationship between implementing agencies for projects financed by the Bank and other&#13;
multilateral and official bilateral agencies and the Committee for the Utilization of Foreign&#13;
Capital in the Ministry of Finance. Further, the Ministry of Finance and Uzenmunaigas have&#13;
already entered into a preliminary Memorandum of Understanding governing the procedures for&#13;
the review by the Government of procurement documentation and decisions.  During&#13;
negotiations, the Government and Uzenmunaigas confirmed their intent to include the provisions&#13;
of this Memorandum of Understanding by reference and as relevant, in the proposed subsidiary&#13;
loan agreement. The Memorandum of Understanding has been reviewed by the Bank and its&#13;
provisions are satisfactory.&#13;
I.    DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
6.55 The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed on the following basis: (i) goods: 100%&#13;
of foreign expenditures, or 100% of ex-factory cost of locally manufactured goods or 75% of&#13;
other goods procured locally; (ii) works: 82% of total costs; (iii) technical services: 100% of&#13;
foreign expenditures; and (iv) technical &amp; management know how, consultants' services and&#13;
technical assistance and training: 100% of expenditures. All disbursement claims would be&#13;
fully documented, except for contracts for consultant and technical services, goods and works&#13;
costing less than (i) US$100,000 with regard to contracts with consulting firms; and (ii)&#13;
US$50,000 with regard to contracts with individuals, which would be made on the basis of&#13;
statements of expenditures (SOEs). The documentation for these expenditures would be retained&#13;
by Uzenneft for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in&#13;
which the last disbursement was made. This documentation would be made available for review&#13;
by the auditors and the Bank upon request.&#13;
6.56 In order to facilitate the disbursement of funds, during the early stage of the project, the&#13;
initial allocation of the Special Account would be limited to US$100,000. However, when the&#13;
aggregate disbursement under the loan reaches US$3.0 million, the initial allocation may be&#13;
increased to the authorized allocation of US$600,000 by submitting the relevant Application for&#13;
Withdrawal. Re.plenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months, and&#13;
must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents. A&#13;
schedule of estimated disbursements is shown at Annex 6.11. The project is expected to be&#13;
completed by June 30, 2000 and the closing Date for the Loan is expected to be December 31,&#13;
2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. The Project                                                                 62&#13;
6.57 The Special Account (SA) would be maintained in a commercial bank selected by the&#13;
Government and acceptable to the World Bank. This bank would be selected, from a number&#13;
of acceptable banks, on the basis of competitive bids. Selection criteria for participation in the&#13;
bids are: (i) the bank should be financially sound as demonstrated by their latest accounts, as&#13;
audited by an internationally recognized accounting finn; (ii) the bank should have a significant&#13;
foreign correspondence network covering all major currencies; (iii) the bank should have a&#13;
reasonable capacity and experience for issuing letters of credit, for making direct foreign&#13;
payments and other international transactions, with appropriate arrangements for the training and&#13;
development of their staff; (iv) the bank should be capable of performing a wide range of local&#13;
banking services, including cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks, issuance of debit&#13;
notes, application of conversion rates from foreign currencies, and maintenance of adequate&#13;
accounts for the SA; (v) the bank should preferably be a member of Swift (Society for&#13;
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) and should routinely use or plan to use the&#13;
facility to expedite payment transfers; (vi) the bank should be willing to issue a Comfort Letter&#13;
to assure that amounts deposited in a Special Account will not be set off or otherwise seized or&#13;
attached to satisfy amounts due to the commercial bank by the borrower; (vii) the bank should&#13;
be willing to maintain adequate accounts as required by the World Bank, provide monthly bank&#13;
statements to the World Bank and, any other information considered necessary. Copies of all&#13;
transactions would be routinely submitted to Uzenmunaigas; and (viii) the bank should be willing&#13;
to charge reasonable rates for their services and provide reasonable interest on balances held&#13;
from time to time. The commercial banks to manage the Special Account must be selected prior&#13;
to loan effectiveness.&#13;
6.58 During appraisal, loan withdrawal and the associated reporting arrangements to the&#13;
Government and the Bank were reviewed in detail. The proposed arrangements which were&#13;
confimned during negotiations are illustrated in Chart 5.&#13;
J.    REPORTING AND MoNrroRiNG&#13;
6.59 Accounts and Audits: Uzenmunaigas. Uzenmunaigas is currently required to submit&#13;
quarterly accounts to the Government. The accounts, which are based on an oil industry&#13;
variation of the uniform national chart of accounts, are used principally as a basis for tax audits.&#13;
No external financial audits are performed. There is no internal audit function, either probity&#13;
or operational. A detailed plan for the restructuring of the management and financial accounts&#13;
of Uzenmunaigas, based on a reorganized divisional structure and accounting units and allocation&#13;
of accounting responsibilities between such units and headquarters, will be implemented under&#13;
the project. Until this restructuring is well-advanced, key deficiencies in accounting procedures&#13;
within Uzenmunaigas will remain. These deficiencies include: (i) the adoption of different&#13;
accounting policies for similar transactions by different accounting units; (ii) the non-segregation&#13;
of external and internal transactions and the recognition of profits on both types of transactions;&#13;
(iii) multiple accounting of transactions in different accounting units; (iv) absence of adequate&#13;
reconciliation procedures in the accounting units; and (v) lack of adequate internal controls. The&#13;
conversion of accounts from Kazakstan standards to IAS is relatively straightforward once the&#13;
underlying structure of accounts and accounting procedures are adequate. At present, the&#13;
Uzenmunaigas accounts do not meet these criteria and cannot be converted cost-effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63                                                                   VI. The Project&#13;
6.60 In view of the above, during negotiations, agreement was reached with Uzenmunaigas&#13;
on the following accounting disclosure and auditing requirements: Uzenmunaigas will: (i) for&#13;
the period up to June 30, 1997, furnish to the Bank, on a quarterly basis, no later than six weeks&#13;
after the end of the relevant quarter, the income statements and balance sheets for its operations&#13;
based on its accounting standards; (ii) for subsequent periods, submit for the period after June&#13;
30, 1997 until completion of the project, Uzenmunaigas willfurnish to the Bank, on a quarterly&#13;
basis, no later than six weeks after the end of the relevant quarter, the divisional accounts of&#13;
each division and the consolidated accounts for all divisions of Uzenmunaigas based on&#13;
international accounting standards; (iii) for the periodfrom September 30, 1996 until completion&#13;
of the project, furnish to the Bank, on a quarterly basis, no later than six weeks after the end&#13;
of the relevant quarter, project accounts, all such income statements, balance sheets, divisional&#13;
accounts and Project Accounts in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank; and (iv) furnish&#13;
to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the end of each&#13;
fiscal year, (a) certified copies of its audited financial statements for such year; and (b) the&#13;
report of such audit of such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably request.&#13;
During negotiations, it was clarified that, for its fiscal year 1997 and subsequent fiscal years&#13;
until project completion, during which period its accounting systems and procedures would have&#13;
been fully revamped and its internal controls strengthened, Uzenmunaigas' accounts would be&#13;
audited by an international accounting firm, satisfactory to the Bank, under terms of engagement&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank. For its fiscal year 1996, Uzenmunaigas will ensure that its annual&#13;
accounts are duly reviewed by a firm of auditors, satisfactory to the Bank, under terms of&#13;
engagement for the review that are satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
6.61 Accounts and Audits: the Borrower. During negotiations, agreement was reached with&#13;
the Borrower that: (a) with respect to expenditures made on the basis of SOEs, it will: (i)&#13;
maintain or cause to be maintained in accordance with sound accounting practices, records and&#13;
accounts reflecting such expenditures; (ii) ensure that all records (contracts, orders, invoices,&#13;
bills, receipts and other documents) evidencing such expenditures are retained until at least one&#13;
year after the Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal&#13;
from the Loan Account was made; and (iii) enable the Bank's representatives to examine such&#13;
records, (b) it will (iv) have the records and accounts for the SOE referred to above and those&#13;
for each fiscal year audited, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently&#13;
applied, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (v) furnish to the Bank as soon as&#13;
available, but in any case not later than six months after the end of each such year the report&#13;
of such audit by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall have&#13;
reasonably requested, including a separate opinion by said auditors as to whether the statements&#13;
of expenditure submitted during such fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal&#13;
controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals; and&#13;
(vi) furnish to the Bank such other information concerning said records and accounts and the&#13;
audit thereof as the Bank shall from time to time reasonably request.&#13;
6.62 Monitoring of Implementation Progress. Uzenmunaigas will provide monthly reports to&#13;
the Bank detailing progress made against the milestones established in the Schedule of Critical&#13;
Procurement Activities (Annex 6.9).  Additional procurement-related information will be&#13;
provided in comprehensive quarterly reports and will include: (a) revised cost estimates, if any,&#13;
for individual contracts and any planned amendment actions; (b) revised schedules of&#13;
procurement activities, including advertising, bidding, contract award, disbursement progress&#13;
and anticipated completion dates for individual contracts; and (c) compliance with aggregate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. The Project                                                               64&#13;
limits on specified methods for Bank-financed procurement as well as with prior review&#13;
provisions on procurement activities.&#13;
6.63 A supervision plan is outlined in Annex 6.12. The key operating and financial targets&#13;
to be monitored during project implementation are detailed in Annex 6.13. During negotiations&#13;
agreement was reached with Uzenmunaigas and the Government that, no later than June 30,&#13;
1997, a mid-term review of the progress of the project and desirable changes in the scope or&#13;
structure of the project, will be undertaken. Prior to the review, Uzenmunaigas will prepare a&#13;
report focussing on the following principal issues: (a) the achievement of the production goals&#13;
of the project; (b) the project's contribution to the financial performance of Uzenmunaigas; (c)&#13;
progress in the physical implementation of the project relative to both physical and cost targets&#13;
established at project inception; and (d) the success of the institutional development components&#13;
of the project covering an evaluation of the training and technology transfer components, the&#13;
project's role in attracting additional investment resources and the project's contribution to the&#13;
strengthening of the capacity of Uzenmunaigas to participate effectively in the management of&#13;
the rehabilitation program.&#13;
6.64 Project Launch Workshop. A project launch workshop will be held, no later than two&#13;
months after Board Presentation, to review with the Govermnent and Uzenmunaigas the&#13;
implementation arrangements and schedule for the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A.    PROJECT BENEFITS AND COSTS&#13;
7.1   The project's main benefit would be a substantial increase in oil production from existing&#13;
producer wells in the selected project areas. The sources of the anticipated incremental oil&#13;
production are four-fold: First, the project is expected to lead to an initial increase in fluid&#13;
production per well, an increase in the oil content per unit of fluid produced and a decrease in&#13;
the current rate of decline in the oil-to-water ratio per unit of fluid produced. Second, production&#13;
from selected shut-in wells rendered inoperative due to deferral of services and lack of parts&#13;
would be restored. Third, the frequency of servicing of wells as a result of wax buildup would&#13;
be reduced, increasing the time wells are available for production and boosting the capacity of&#13;
Uzenmunaigas to service wells in general. Fourth, the project would relieve the constraints on&#13;
wells production resulting from the periodic plugging and frequent leakages in fluid gathering&#13;
lines and it would contribute to the elimination of the near-term but unpredictable threat of the&#13;
collapse of the deteriorated field surface facilities and the cessation of oil production.&#13;
7.2   Production Assumptions. With the project, fluid production per rehabilitated well is&#13;
projected to increase by about 61% from 18 cm/day to 29 cm/day accompanied by a reduction&#13;
in the water-cut (water content per unit.of fluid production) from 75 % to 50%. Under these&#13;
conditions, average per well oil production would increase from around 5 tons per day to 14 tons&#13;
per day. Oil production per well is projected to decline at a rate of around 10% per annum&#13;
thereafter. Based on these projections, total oil production from the project area would amount&#13;
to 12.3 million toIIs over a 17-year production horizon. For the pre-selected Block 3A, it is&#13;
estimated that the projected oil production would result in an ultimate recovery of about 30% of&#13;
the original oil in place in the formations in the block. This level of recovery is consistent with&#13;
the technically feasible recovery factors projected by independent reservoir engineering&#13;
consultants.&#13;
7.3   Without the project, it is assumed that workovers would be implemented in the selected&#13;
project areas by external investors. Over the last two years, a number of independent workover&#13;
contractors and small foreign oil companies have expressed interest in rehabilitating producer&#13;
wells in the Uzen oil field outside of the investment promotion activities supported by the Bank.&#13;
The rehabilitation proposals presented to Uzenmunaigas have had a fairly uniform structure viz:&#13;
the contractors would: (a) have the right to select a block or several blocks in the field to be&#13;
subject to rehabilitation; (b) hold exclusive rights to perform workovers in such selected blocks;&#13;
(c) determine the scope of work to be undertaken, subject to Uzenmunaigas' approval; (d) be&#13;
reimbursed for the cost (including a profit element) of all workover performed on each well&#13;
irrespective of the success of the work; alternatively, some proposed agreements provide for a&#13;
guaranteed return on the contractor's investment in the blocks which would be achieved through&#13;
appropriate transfer pricing to Uzenmunaigas of all oil produced within such blocks; and (e) share&#13;
in the incremental oil produced beyond a pre-specified production baseline.&#13;
7.4   The features of the above investment proposals have important implications for the&#13;
conduct of workovers. Since the contractors' returns are substantially unrelated to the successful&#13;
outcome of their work, they would be expected to have: (i) less incentive to maximize fluid and&#13;
oil production after rehabilitation or to invest in pre-workover wells-screening procedures to&#13;
increase the probability of success of workovers; and (ii) limited interest in the optimal&#13;
exploitation of reserves through the life of the reserves in the blocks and a strong tendency to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66                                                          VII. Economic Evaluation&#13;
exploitation of reserves through the life of the reserves in the blocks and a strong tendency to&#13;
maximize short-term production in the cases where the achieved production, post-rehabilitation,&#13;
is greater than the pre-specified baseline.&#13;
7.5   The provisions of the proposals also potentially have both adverse production externalities&#13;
and distributional consequences: (a) the oil-bearing layers in the Uzen field straddle all the&#13;
blocks in the field and the management of rehabilitation and production activities in the blocks&#13;
selected by contractors independently of the management of the parts of the same underlying&#13;
reservoirs in other areas of the field would lead to sub-optimal exploitation of the field as a&#13;
whole; and (b) the guaranteed returns to the contractors might be financed out of the cashflow&#13;
generated in other activities in the field.&#13;
7.6   Based on the above, it is projected that in the without-project case, workovers would be&#13;
characterized by the following attributes: (i) the average failure rate of workovers, i.e the&#13;
proportion of workovers that would not result in increased post-workover fluid production,&#13;
would be 25 % compared to 10% in the with-project case; (ii) fluid production in the case of&#13;
effective workovers would increase by 50% or about 82% of the increase in the with-project&#13;
case; (iii) the water-cut in immediate post-worker fluid production would remain at the current&#13;
(pre-workover) average field-wide rate of 73 %; and (iv) the rate of decline in oil production,&#13;
post-workover, would be reduced to 12% per annum. The projections reflect the incentive&#13;
structure of the investment proposals extant and the likely absence of any systematic&#13;
improvements in reservoir management practices under such structure. The potential impact of&#13;
adverse production externalities is not taken into account. The total oil production in the&#13;
without-project case under these conditions is projected at 4.3 million tons over a production&#13;
period of 11 years.&#13;
7.7   The total incremental oil production from the project, based on the production profiles&#13;
with and without the project, is about eight million tons. The projected peak annual incremental&#13;
oil production is about 0.8 million tons (about 15,000 bbllday) in the fifth year of the project.&#13;
The projected production profiles and incremental oil production are illustrated in Annex 7.1 and&#13;
Annex 7.2.&#13;
7.8   Oil Price Assumptions.  The composition of oil sales for Uzen crude oil sales for the&#13;
first eight months of 1995 are shown in Annex 7.3. Currently, about 44% of Uzen oil sales are&#13;
based on the toll-processing of crude oil at the Atyrau refinery with Uzenmunaigas taking&#13;
delivery of petroleum products for sale to third parties. The balance of Uzen oil sales consist&#13;
of export sales to other countries of the FSU (22 % of total sales), swaps with Russian producers&#13;
and traders for equivalent (after transport-cost and quality adjustments) deliveries to the eastern&#13;
Kazakstan refineries (20%) and export sales to international markets outside the FSU (14%).&#13;
7.9   Based on assays performed by the Atyrau refinery, the yield of high-value light prodwcts&#13;
(gasoline, diesel and kerosene) from Uzen oil processed in the Atyrau refinery is only about&#13;
39 %. The balance of refined output consists of low-value heavy fuel oil. Ex-refinery petroleum&#13;
product prices in all regions of Kazakstan are close to import parity levels. However, the yield&#13;
structure of refined Uzen crude oil depresses net revenues to about US$40 per ton after&#13;
processing charges of 30% of the gross value of the petroleum products (Annex 7.4). About&#13;
80 % of the net petroleum product yield is bartered by Uzenmunaigas for local operating inputs&#13;
e.g power purchases, and food.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VIl. Economic Evaluation                                                          67&#13;
7.10 Swap transactions with Russian oil producers are structured on a basis that allows&#13;
Uzenmunaigas to: (i) toll-process exchanged crude oil at the refineries in Chimkent or Pavlodar;&#13;
or (ii) sell the received crude oil to the large network of oil traders in the Omsk area in Russia;&#13;
or (iii) sell the received crude oil directly to the refineries. The appropriate benchmark for&#13;
valuing swap transactions is the net value to Uzemnunaigas from toll-processing and sale of&#13;
petroleum products. Based on current ex-refinery prices (excluding VAT), the gross value of&#13;
the yield of petroleum products per ton of crude oil processed in Chimkent and Pavlodar is&#13;
US$85 and US$100 respectively. The net value per ton of crude oil after transport charges,&#13;
crude oil quality adjustments and toll processing fees is US$57 at Chimkent and US$77 per ton&#13;
at Pavlodar. The audit, performed by a major international accounting fimn, indicates that&#13;
Uzenmunaigas sold all crude oil received under swap transactions to oil trading intermediaries&#13;
or the Russian swap party. The effective discount on the netback on product sales incurred by&#13;
Uzenmunaigas for these direct sales transactions is estimated at 10% for an average (assuming&#13;
even distribution of sales between the Chimkent and Pavlodar market catchment areas) effective&#13;
netback of US$60 per ton of swapped crude oil.&#13;
7.11  At present, crude oil export sales to the FSU (outside Russia) are mainly to the Ukraine,&#13;
which accounted for about 75 % of all such sales in the first eight months of 1995. Export prices&#13;
to the Ukraine over this period varied from US$70 to US$80 per ton at the refinery gate&#13;
(including VAT levied by Kazakstan). These prices represented a relatively stable fraction of&#13;
international crude oil prices (fob Novorissiysk) of about 75 %. Based on current export sales&#13;
prices, the netback at the Kazakstan border from oil exports to the Ukraine, after transport and&#13;
sales charges, is US$68 per ton. The balance of FSU export sales have been mainly to Belarus.&#13;
Export sales to Belarus have been at a variable but progressively narrowing price discount to&#13;
Ukraine sales. Evidence from the latter half of 1995 indicates that the discount has been&#13;
eliminated. All sales in 1995 to the FSU (outside Russia) have been for cash settlement and the&#13;
record of payment to the sales intermediary (the Kazakstan state-owned oil trading company,&#13;
Munai-impex) has been good.&#13;
7.12 For exports to international markets, Kazakstan has two major transport channels: (i)&#13;
through the seaport of Ventspils in Latvia; and (ii) through Novorissiysk. Net sales revenues&#13;
per barrel of crude oil from the two outlets are similar although transit reliability to Ventspils&#13;
is lower due to the greater numbers of transiting countries involved. Crude oil exported through&#13;
Novorissiysk is traded in the Mediterranean with Brent as the marker crude. Crude oil streams&#13;
from Kazakstan are initially blended at Atyrau and further blended at Samara in Russia with&#13;
crude oil from other fields in Russia and traded as Ural Export Blend (UEB). UEB suffers a&#13;
quality discount of about US$4.4 per ton (US$0.6 per bbl) relative to the Brent marker price.&#13;
Transport and port handling charges to Augusta, Italy (Mediterranean trading point) from Uzen&#13;
amount to US$22.8 per ton (US$3 per bbl). At the present (mid-October 1995), Brent marker&#13;
price of US$16.5 per bbl, the current international export-parity price for Uzen crude oil is&#13;
about US$93 per ton (US$12.7 per bbl).&#13;
7.13 At present, virtually all of the available export pipeline transport quota to international&#13;
markets outside the FSU has been allocated to joint-venture operations or the domestic PAs with&#13;
substantial foreign debt-service obligations.  Until additional export pipeline capacity is&#13;
developed, Uzenmunaigas would not be able to export significant incremental amounts of oil to&#13;
international markets outside the FSU. However, there is adequate headroom for exports to&#13;
regional markets, through swaps or direct deliveries, to accommodate incremental production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68                                                          VIl. Economic Evaluation&#13;
from Uzenmunaigas. In the absence of regulatory pressures to sell or process oil through&#13;
Atyrau, all incremental production would be expected to be directed to the regional market.&#13;
7.14 For the economic evaluation of the benefits of the project, it is assumed that in the&#13;
counterfactual case, Uzen oil sales continue to be distributed as at present. In the case of the&#13;
project, it is assumed that sales through Atyrau refinery are equal to the amount channelled to&#13;
the refinery in the counterfactual case. Under this assignment, sales to Atyrau decline from 40 %&#13;
of total sales at the beginning of the project to zero (at the cessation of production in the&#13;
without-project case). Oil sales over and above the amount to Atyrau are allocated equally&#13;
between swaps and CIS sales. Based on this market distribution and the price of oil in the&#13;
various markets, the average price of oil in the projections in the project case varies from US$55&#13;
per ton at the start of the project to US$64 per ton from the twelfth project year. Oil prices in&#13;
each of the three markets are maintained at the 1995 level in nominal terms until 2000;&#13;
thereafter, all prices and input costs are maintained in constant terms. These price assumptions&#13;
are conservative. To ensure that the benefits to the project are not unduly depressed by&#13;
involuntary toll-processing of crude oil by Uzenmunaigas at the Atyrau refinery, agreement was&#13;
reached with the Government during appraisal, that Uzenmunaigas would be free to market its&#13;
crude oil as it deems to be commercially appropriate. This agreement is in line with current&#13;
Government policy and was confirmed during negotiations. In addition to the above agreement,&#13;
which is covenanted under the Loan Agreement, the Government has declared its intention to&#13;
pass an implementing resolution for the proposed project under which Uzenmunaigas' ability to&#13;
market its crude oil--domestically and regionally-- would be fully clarified.&#13;
7.15 Operating Cost Assumptions. The incremental operating costs under the project are&#13;
mainly parts and equipment for the maintenance of wells and production facilities, electricity for&#13;
lifting oil and pumping water and fluid, and chemicals for wax, scale and corrosion inhibition.&#13;
Kazakstan does not produce oil field equipment, parts and chemicals. These inputs are imported&#13;
and are evaluated at international prices plus transport costs to Uzen. The foreign currency costs&#13;
of imported inputs exclude taxes and duties.  It is assumed that the future periodic workover&#13;
and servicing of the wells rehabilitated under the project would be undertaken by independent&#13;
contractors or by an appropriately structured autonomous division of Uzenmunaigas. The cost&#13;
of the periodic workover and routine servicing of wells reflect mainly the capital cost of rigs and&#13;
the cost of replacing equipment and parts in wells. It is estimated that the cost of post-&#13;
rehabilitation workovers would be equal to about 30 % of the cost of workover of a well under&#13;
the project.&#13;
7.16 Electricity is the main source of domestic operating costs. The north-western region of&#13;
Kazakstan has a large deficit of power generating capacity, and imports of electricity from&#13;
Russia account for a significant share of its electricity requirement. The domestic price of&#13;
electricity in the evaluation reflects the estimated marginal economic cost of power in the region.&#13;
7.17 The price of non-tradeable goods and services in Kazakstan is expected to increase&#13;
significantly in the medium term relative to internationally tradeable goods to correct the&#13;
substantial undervaluation of the real exchange rate of the tenge. The magnitude and timing of&#13;
the correction is uncertain.  For planning purposes and for the economic and financial&#13;
projections, it is assumed that local costs will increase at a rate of 15% per annum over the&#13;
project implementation period relative to increases in foreign costs (of importable goods and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VII. Economic Evaluation                                                           69&#13;
services), which are assumed to move in line with the Bank's projections of increases in the&#13;
Bank's muv index. The exchange rate is held constant at the current nominal rate.&#13;
7.18  The wells to be rehabilitated under the project account for about 12% of the estimated&#13;
total producer wells in the field. No incremental fixed costs for the operation of the field are&#13;
assigned to the project. In the economic evaluation, it is assumed that Uzenmunaigas is&#13;
successful in attracting other external resources for the rehabilitation of the rest of the wells and&#13;
the infrastructure in the field. Based on the evaluation of the prospects for the field as a whole,&#13;
production in the rest of the field is likely to cease within the next five years or so unless a&#13;
concerted rehabilitation program is undertaken. If production in the rest of the field ceases, the&#13;
project would have to incur the necessary fixed costs of operating the field. No benefit is&#13;
assigned to the project for the reduction in field-wide operating costs that are likely to arise from&#13;
some of the management components or restructuring conditions of the project. The implications&#13;
for the operating costs of the project of lack of success in attracting other sources of external&#13;
financing for the rehabilitation of the rest of the field are considered in paragraph 7.27 below.&#13;
7.19 The operating cost structure of the project (based on the incremental economic costs with&#13;
the project) is summarized in Annex 7.5. Reflecting the build-up in oil production,total&#13;
operating costs under the project (excluding field-wide shared costs, depreciation and&#13;
rehabilitation expenses financed under the project) decrease from US$11.4 per ton (US$1.6 per&#13;
bbl) in the first project year to a low of US$6.7 per ton (US$0.9 per bbl) in the fourth year of&#13;
the project. Unit operating costs are subsequently projected to increase markedly thereafter as&#13;
the ratio of water to oil increases from 50% at the inception of the project to 85% by 2010.&#13;
However, owing to the large fixed costs of field operations already in place, the average&#13;
operating cost over the producing life of the project is relatively low at about US$17 per ton&#13;
(US$2.3 per bbl) on a nominal undiscounted basis or US$14 per ton (US$1.8 per bbl) on a&#13;
discounted basis (with costs and production discounted at 12%).&#13;
7.20 Capital Cost Assumptions. The investment costs used in the economic evaluation are the&#13;
costs of all project components, net of taxes and duties. In addition, the economic evaluation&#13;
takes into account the estimated costs of replacing the satellite and gathering stations and&#13;
flowlines needed to serve a cluster of about 150 wells -- the estimated number of wells outside&#13;
Block 3A which are to be rehabilitated under the project. The cost of the rehabilitation of&#13;
surface facilities outside Block 3A is not provided for in the financing of the project. It is&#13;
expected that such complementary investments to the workovers outside of Block 3A would be&#13;
financed in subsequent phases of the rehabilitation program.&#13;
7.21  In the case of the assumed counterfactual, the investment costs include only the cost of&#13;
rehabilitating producer wells. In line with the typical feature of the agreements in place, no&#13;
provision is made for the rehabilitation of the surface infrastructure. The Bank's experience in&#13;
oil projects in the region indicate that the cost of equipment, parts and services under the type&#13;
of proposed agreements now seen in Uzemnunaigas (and which were fairly prevalent in the&#13;
Russian oil industry in the early years of the Bank's involvement) are significantly higher than&#13;
those received under the Bank's competitive procedures. However, to be conservative, no&#13;
premium over the Bank's cost estimates are included in the without-project case.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70                                                         VII. Economic Evaluation&#13;
B.   EcoNoMIc RETuRNS&#13;
7.22 The economic returns to the project based on project benefits and costs enumerated above&#13;
are summarized in the table below and detailed in Annex 7.6.&#13;
Project Economic Returns&#13;
Economic Rate of Return       Net Present Value (12%)&#13;
Base Case:                  38%                    US$75 million&#13;
The base case economic return (ERR), at 38%, is satisfactory.&#13;
7.23 To test for the sensitivity of the project's economic returns to possible adverse outcomes,&#13;
an analysis of the extent to which key project variables would need to deteriorate before the&#13;
project yields an ERR of 12 % was undertaken. The results of this analysis of the circumstances&#13;
under which the project switches from being economically viable to non-viable are shown in the&#13;
table below:&#13;
Switching Value of Key Variables&#13;
Project Costs (% of Base Case)                        165%&#13;
Oil Price (% of Base Case)                             60%&#13;
Oil Production After Workovers (% of Base Case)        74%&#13;
Increase in Local Operating Costs (% of Base Case)    204%&#13;
7.24 The analysis of the project's switching values indicates that the ERR for the project is&#13;
robust in relation to increases in project costs and declines in prices well within the ranges that&#13;
could be reasonably anticipated. Based on the projected sales mix, the switching value for the&#13;
oil price is equivalent to about US$52 per ton (US$7.1 per bbl) for exports to the CIS and&#13;
US$35 per ton (US$4.8 per bbl) for swaps with Russian producers. The switching value&#13;
analysis also demonstrates the limited impact of increases in operating costs on the ERR given&#13;
the large margin between the discounted unit operating costs and the projected oil prices.&#13;
7.25 The results of the switching value analysis for the oil price has been confirmed by a&#13;
Monte Carlo simulation of oil prices. The simulation indicates that the probability of a viable&#13;
project under uncertain (stochastic) oil prices is greater than 90% (Annex 7. 7).  The&#13;
opportunities to hedge against potential adverse oil price movements in Kazakstan are limited&#13;
at present but there are price hedging strategies that may be both feasible and viable (Annex 7. 7).&#13;
The financial management consultants to be financed under the project would assist&#13;
Uzenmunaigas in identifying and implementing possible and cost-effective options for limiting&#13;
the impact of adverse oil price movements on Uzenmunaigas' financial performance.&#13;
7.26 While the program of wells testing and additional reservoir analysis to be undertaken&#13;
under the project would contribute to improving information on the likely outcome of the&#13;
workover program, the actual production from any candidate well would remain uncertain until&#13;
the workover is completed and the well is brought back into production. Thereafter, subject to&#13;
appropriate production and maintenance practices, production is likely to follow relatively well-&#13;
established decline patterns. To evaluate the impact of this uncertainty on the project ERR, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VII. Economic Evaluation                                                        71&#13;
Monte Carlo simulation of initial wells production, based on extensive sampling from a likely&#13;
distribution of wells production performance, was undertaken. The result of this analysis&#13;
suggests that the project has a high probability (greater than 95 %) of achieving rates of returns&#13;
greater than the benchmark for economic viability.&#13;
7.27 The impact on the project of a lack of resources to rehabilitate the rest of the field is&#13;
illustrated in Annex 7.8. If the field were to cease production within five years as projected in&#13;
Chapter 5 in the case that no rehabilitation investments are undertaken, field-wide fixed and&#13;
shared costs (i.e labor, transport services, water supply, administrative costs, etc.) would need&#13;
to be reduced by about 55 % for the project to be able to bear such necessary additional costs&#13;
of operating the field and still be economically viable. Thus, under very adverse field-wide&#13;
conditions, the project could still continue to be viable, if adequate restructuring actions are&#13;
taken. The proposed project would help Uzenmunaigas to strengthen its capacity to restructure&#13;
and manage its operations to continue to be viable under adverse business conditions.&#13;
7.28 Finally, the impact of delays in the implementation of the project has been analyzed. The&#13;
analysis assumes that the profile of workovers is extended to six years with a one year delay in&#13;
the start of the program, all other things being equal. This scenario results in an ERR of about&#13;
30%. To the extent that Uzenmunaigas would benefit from the technical support in reservoir&#13;
management and improved production practices that are included in the project during the period&#13;
of delay, the decline in the ERR is probably overstated.&#13;
C.   PROJECT RISKs&#13;
7.29 The major risks faced by the project are: (i) implementation: the risk that project&#13;
completion may be delayed and the benefits of the project not realized and sustained; (ii)&#13;
reservoir: the risk that the projected production increases may not be achievable because of the&#13;
physical properties or condition of the reservoir and wells in the selected project areas; (iii)&#13;
market and pricing: the risk that a reduced demand in regional markets may cause reduced sales&#13;
volumes and that oil prices may not be adequate to ensure the project's viability; (iv) financing&#13;
constraints: the risk that inadequate cash generation in Uzen operations as a whole would lead&#13;
to inappropriate use of the project's cash flow and inability to replace or maintain key field&#13;
assets; and (iv) field management policies:  the adoption of inappropriate policies for&#13;
management of the rehabilitation of the field which may limit total oil recovery.&#13;
7.30 Implementation Risk. The project management capacity of Uzenmunaigas is weak at this&#13;
stage and operating and maintenance practices in the Uzen field would need sustained&#13;
improvements to ensure that the equipment and facilities to be provided under the project are&#13;
utilized effectively. These weaknesses would be mitigated to some extent by the implementation&#13;
arrangements and training envisaged under the project. A successful outcome to the on-going&#13;
search for a long-term operating partner would further mitigate these risks and enhance the&#13;
sustainability of project benefits beyond the project period.&#13;
7.31 Reservoir Risk: The condition of the reservoirs in the field is uncertain and historic wells&#13;
performance data may be unreliable for a variety of reasons. Nonetheless, the projected&#13;
increases in future oil production are well within increases achieved in the past under operating&#13;
conditions similar to those envisaged with the project. The risk that substantial investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72                                                         VII. Economic Evaluation&#13;
would be made in wells that subsequently perform uneconomically is low given the proposed&#13;
comprehensive program of pre-investment wells testing and analysis.&#13;
7.32 Market and Pricing Risk: There is a risk that demand may be weak in regional markets&#13;
or transport flows may be subject to interruption. These adverse events would be reflected&#13;
either in lower sales volumes or depressed prices against which Uzenmunaigas may have limited&#13;
options or capacity to hedge. There is also a risk of erosion in domestic oil prices. The&#13;
sensitivity analysis suggest that project returns are relatively robust in the face of declines or&#13;
variations in the price of crude oil and in crude oil production and sales. However, these risks&#13;
could be further mitigated by strengthening Uzenmunaigas' marketing capacity and diversifying&#13;
its markets within the transport constraints it faces as well as by implementing, if possible, price&#13;
hedging strategies.&#13;
7.33 FYnancing Constraints: The long-tern sustainability of the project depends on progress&#13;
made in the rehabilitation of the rest of the field and in commercializing Uzenmunaigas'&#13;
operations. Without this, there is a significant risk that the resources generated under the project&#13;
and required for reinvestment to sustain field operations may be devoted to the non-viable&#13;
activities of Uzemnunaigas. The capacity of Uzenmunaigas to protect against this risk depends&#13;
on how rapidly progress is made in attracting additional outside financing and in the&#13;
restructuring of its operation and management. Satisfactory plans and actions are under&#13;
development or underway to address these issues. These plans and actions are monitorable and&#13;
would be the subject of on-going review during project implementation.&#13;
7.34 Field Management Policies: The investment program for the full rehabilitation of the&#13;
Uzen field and the proposed Bank-financed project have been designed on the basis that the field&#13;
would be managed, for operational and investment activities, as a single unit and that all future&#13;
investment agreements would be entered into on the basis of such a policy. In the absence of&#13;
adherence to such a policy, the ultimate recovery of oil, the economic viability of a rehabilitation&#13;
program and the sustainability of the project would be materially and adversely affected. The&#13;
potential long-term operating partners that have already visited the field to conduct due diligence&#13;
reviews prior to deciding on participating in the tender of the field under the organized search&#13;
for private investors financed by the Bank have made it clear that the attraction of the field as&#13;
an investment target would be significantly diminished if it is not managed as a single unit.&#13;
There is currently an agreement between Uzenmunaigas and an outside party which provides for&#13;
significant areas of the field to be rehabilitated outside of a framework for the field as a whole.&#13;
The Government and Uzenmunaigas have provided adequate assurances that all future investment&#13;
agreements would be on the basis that the field is managed as a single unit. In addition, through&#13;
the right of review and approval of work programs provided for under all agreements,&#13;
Uzenmunaigas can exercise considerable influence over the type and nature of work performed&#13;
by contractors to ensure that they are consistent with an optimal field-wide approach.&#13;
&#13;

VIII. FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
A.   MAIN ASSUMPTIONS&#13;
8.1   The financial evaluation of the project has been undertaken on a stand-alone basis. No&#13;
explicit account has been taken of the impact of the project on the financial performance or&#13;
position of Uzenrunaigas as a whole. The long term financial prospects for the Uzen oil field&#13;
as a whole, based on the full implementation of a rehabilitation program, has been assessed in&#13;
Chapter 5. The assessment in Chapter 5 is based on financial projections which incorporate the&#13;
effects of the proposed project. Short-to-medium term (1996 to 2000) projections of the cash&#13;
generating prospects for Uzenmunaigas as a whole have been prepared by consultants. These&#13;
projections have been used by the Government and Uzerununaigas as a basis for the development&#13;
of options to stem the threat of potential insolvency of Uzenmunaigas' operations. The&#13;
consultant's projections assume: (i) the continuation of the existing mode of operation; (ii) no&#13;
Bank-supported project and other external financing of rehabilitation activities; (iii) no&#13;
implementation of cost saving and revenue generating measures within the resources available to&#13;
Uzenmunaigas; and (iv) no restructuring of financial management practices, particularly with&#13;
respect to the management of accounts receivable in swap-based transactions and in the use of&#13;
barter in domestic direct-sales transactions. The projections are summarized in Annex 8.1. They&#13;
indicate that, without short-term corrective actions, Uzenmunaigas would collapse financially&#13;
within three years.&#13;
8.2   The financial projections for the project are based on the production profiles, operating&#13;
costs and pricing assumptions used in the economic evaluation but including taxes as appropriate.&#13;
The investment costs used in the analysis are the estimated costs of project components to be&#13;
financed under the project. No account is taken of the cost of other complementary facilities not&#13;
included in the project (e.g. field separation and gathering facilities). It is assumed that any such&#13;
costs would be financed in subsequent phases of the investment program out of the net cash flow&#13;
generated under the project or by external sources.&#13;
8.3   The projections are based on the prevailing taxation rules for businesses as outlined in the&#13;
General Tax Code. The specific treatment of petroleum operations, other than the broad&#13;
framework for taxation of such activities, has yet to be published by the Government. As noted&#13;
earlier (para 2.34), the Government intends to detail such treatment separately in a subsidiary&#13;
petroleum tax code. In the interim, the existing supplementary taxes on petroleum operations are&#13;
assumed to continue to be applicable to the domestically fully-owned segment of the industry.&#13;
The tax and other critical assumptions used in the financial projections are detailed in Annex 8.2.&#13;
B.   PROJECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
8.4   The projected financial performance of the project in constant US dollars (2000) is&#13;

8.5     The projections indicate that the project will generate substantial cash flows over the&#13;
projected producing life of 17 years and is financially attractive to Uzenmunaigas and the&#13;
Govermnent. The after-tax rate of return, based on the differences between the cashflow&#13;
generation with and without the project, is estimated at 31 % and the project generates an after-&#13;
tax present value (at 15 %) of US$24 million. The composition of the projected value created&#13;

8.6    Total incremental taxes generated under the project are substantial at a projected US$94&#13;
million with a present value (at 15 %) of US$26 million. The projected Government share of&#13;
the project's net operating cashflow, at 52%, is comparable (albeit at the high end) to the&#13;
Government's negotiated fiscal share of other oil-field development projects of comparable size.&#13;
8.7    The debt service coverage of the project (on both a total project cashflow  and an&#13;
incremental cashflow basis) is adequate in the first six years of the project. However, it&#13;
deteriorates markedly thereafter (Annex 8.4). This deterioration reflects the underlying natural&#13;
decline in oil production and revenue generation. However, the structure of cash generation&#13;
relative to the pattern of debt service obligations is satisfactory: the cash surplus over debt&#13;
service obligation generated in the first seven years of the project (about US$92 million) exceeds&#13;
substantially the total debt service shortfall (US$4 million) in the latter life of the loan.&#13;
8.8    The profile of the project's debt service coverage however highlights the need for: (i)&#13;
Uzenmunaigas to manage and reinvest, prudently, the initial strong cash generation under the&#13;
project; and (ii) the Government to create appropriate mechanisms to protect itself against the&#13;
risk of inadequate financial management in Uzenmunaigas and the increased risk of default on&#13;
debt service payments in the latter project years. During appraisal, protective or deficiency&#13;
arrangements to cover potential periodic shortfalls in debt servicing capacity which would be&#13;
considered for incorporation in the subsidiary loan agreement were reviewed with the&#13;
Government and Uzenmunaigas.&#13;
C.    RISKS TO FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
8.9    The risks attached to the project's financial viability mirror those outlined in the&#13;
economic evaluation. The project's financial (after tax) rate of return would fall below a&#13;
benchmark of viability of 15 % if: (i) project costs increase by 30%; (ii) oil prices are less than&#13;
76% of the assumed levels in the financial projections; and (iii) oil production increases by less&#13;
than 82 % of the projected increase in the base case. Under any of these conditions, the project's&#13;
debt capacity would barely cover the value of the proposed project debt.&#13;
8.10 Finally, the deteriorated condition of the surface facilities in the project area outside&#13;
Block 3A that are not replaced under the project constitute a serious but unpredictable threat to&#13;
incremental production and the financial viability of the project. The cashflow (after taxes and&#13;
debt-service) generated by the project covers substantially the estimated cost (US$ 31 million)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

facilities outside Block 3A.&#13;
D.   FINANCLAL CovENANTs&#13;
8.11 To protect against the risk of inappropriate investment, financing and financial&#13;
management policies and strategies identified above, the following agreements were reached with&#13;
Uzenmunaigas during negotiations: (i) Investment Plans: that during project implementation,&#13;
Uzenmunaigas will, semi-annually at the request of the Bank, have consultations with the Bank&#13;
on its capital expenditure plans and related financing arrangements and implement the plans and&#13;
arrangements, taidng into account the Bank's views; (ii) Investment Agreements: that during&#13;
project implementation, Uzenmunaigas will make full and complete disclosure to the Bank of&#13;
all agreements and arrangements proposed to be entered into by it for the rehabilitation of any&#13;
part of the Uzen Oil Field together with supporting evaluation of the impact on Uzenmunaigas'&#13;
financial performance of such agreements and arrangements and provide the Bank with any other&#13;
information and documents that the Bank may reasonably request in this regard from time to&#13;
time; (iii) Debt service: except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, debt shall not be incurred,&#13;
unless the net revenues of Uzenmunaigas for the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of&#13;
such incurrence or for a later twelve-month period ended prior to the date of such incurrence,&#13;
whichever is the greater, shall be at least 1.5 times the estimated maximum debt service&#13;
requirements of Uzenmunaigas for any succeeding fiscal year on all debt of Uzenmunaigas,&#13;
including the debt to be incurred.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

a) Quota imposed by Russia for transit through Russian pipeline system.&#13;
b) Nominal capacity through Atyrau-Samara pipeline (linking Kazakstan pipeline network to Russian system) is 13.Om tons p.a. Residual capacity is&#13;

c) Kazakstan to Orsk refinery pipeline has capacity of 6.Om tons p.a. but throughput is limited to 2.6 million tons to match refinery requirements;&#13;
future of Orsk refinery is uncertain, and the refinery has been considered for closure although timing is highly uncertain.&#13;
d) Capacity reflects rate at which shipments made in 1995; up till 1993, Kcazakstan oil used to be shipped by barge from Aktau to Makhachkala&#13;
(Dagestan) and onward by rail to Novarissysk; Atyrau to Novorossiysk replaces that route.&#13;

THE MARKET FOR KAZAKSTAN CRUDE OIL OUTPUT&#13;
International Markets (outside the FSlJ&#13;
1.          Oil exports to international markets outside the region are constrained to about&#13;
5.5 million tons p.a. International oil exports through the Russian pipeline system are limited&#13;
to 3.5 million tons p.a. by a quota imposed by Russia. Until 1993, this route was supplemented&#13;
by exports by barge from the Kazakstan port of Aktau to Dagestan and then by rail to the Black&#13;
Sea port of Novorissiysk. An alternative rail route from Aktau to the port of Novorissiysk&#13;
started is currently in use but is limited to about 2.0 million tons p.a.&#13;
Regional Markets (outside Russia)&#13;
2.          Oil exports by pipeline to countries of the FSU (excluding Russia) are currently&#13;
capped at about 3.5 million tons p.a by a quota on use of the Russian pipeline system. Barge&#13;
transport capacity to regional markets around the Black Sea through the Volga-Don canal is&#13;
limited by capacity along the canal. Significant volumes of oil used to be transported by barge&#13;
to Baku in Azerbaijan but this trade has declined significantly over the last three years and has&#13;
become non-systematic. There are reasonable prospects for oil sales to Iran on a reasonably&#13;
large scale (about 2.0 million tons per annum). However, such trade would require investments&#13;
to upgrade facilities at the port of Aktau and in Iranian oil reception and transport facilities.&#13;
Preliminary engineering work has already been done on possible investment options on this&#13;
route but little further work has been undertaken. In the absence of such facilities, combined&#13;
oil exports through the Volga-Don canal and along the Caspian Sea area of about 0.5 million&#13;
tons per annum is considered feasible.&#13;
Domestic Market&#13;
3.          In the domestic market, available pipeline and rail transport capacity limit feasible&#13;
crude oil sales to about 8.0 million tons p.a.&#13;
Russian Market&#13;
4.          Given the capacity of the pipeline links between Russia and Kazakstan and the full&#13;
utilization of the Russian pipeline export quota to the FSU and international markets, possible&#13;
oil exports to Russia are limited to about 9 million tons.&#13;

UZEN OIL FIELD REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 4.1&#13;
GEOLOGY OF THE FIELD&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The supergiant Uzen was discovered in the South Mangyshlak region in 1959 and&#13;
exploitation began in 1965. It is located on the Zhetybay step that comprises the northern slope&#13;
of the South Mangyshlak trough. The step is characterized by an extremely high density of&#13;
petroleum discoveries; almost all oil and gas fields of the vast South Mangyzshlak region are&#13;
concentrated on this prominent structural trend. All of the productive zones occur in Jurassic&#13;
rocks. Although Lower Cretaceous rock possess good reservoir properties, they are flushed by&#13;
fresh water and do not contain hydrocarbons.&#13;
2.    The Uzen field is an anticline with a maximum oil column of 330m at the oil-water&#13;
contact of 1135m below the ground. Formation dips are gentle and there are no significant&#13;
faults. The productive reservoirs are Middle to Upper Jurassic sandstones deposited in an&#13;
alluvial fan environment. The main reservoirs have been sub-divided into Formations MII&#13;
through XVIII, but each sequence contains several individual sands. The XIII and XIV&#13;
formations contain more than 60% of the original oil-in-place. (00IP). The sands can be&#13;
described as fine-grained, angular, and poorly sorted. They are rich in feldspar and lithic rock&#13;
fragments. Detrital clays and cements (up to 15%) are mainly kaotinite with no swelling clays&#13;
identified. Typically each formation shows a fining upward sequence with the best sands at the&#13;
base and the poorer sands at the top. From well logs and well tests, a common oil-water contact&#13;
across the field at - 1135m below the ground has been interpreted. There were no significant&#13;
initial gas caps, since the oil is under-saturated with a bubble point of 6500 kPa (65 atm),&#13;
compared to an initial pressure of 12375 kPa (124 atm) at the oil-water contact. .&#13;
3.    Fluid Properties: Pressures are hydrostatic (10.9 kPa/m) and the temperature gradient&#13;
is 4.2°C per 100m with an average ground temperature of 14°C at 40m. Analysis of original&#13;
reservoir pressures confirm that all formations were in pressure communication as indicated by&#13;
the common oil-water contact. This may also mean that the shale/siltstones separating the sands&#13;
do not form effective seals and could even contribute to some oil production in the long term.&#13;
Overall, the average fluid properties for all six reservoirs are estimated as follows:&#13;
Oil Gravity                              854 Kg/m' (340 API)&#13;
GOR                                      48 m3/m'&#13;
Initial Oil Formation Volume Factor      1,188 rm3/sm3&#13;
Initial Oil Viscosity                    3.5 cp&#13;
initial Oil Compressibility              14 x 10 -7kPa-'&#13;

The sulphur content is low, between 0.1 and 0.24%. The crude contains up to 20% by&#13;
weight of paraffins and 15 % by weight of resins and up to 2% by weight of asphaltenes. The&#13;
temperature at which wax crystallization starts in live crude is somewhat unclear but is probably&#13;
within 5 to 10°C of the initial reservoir temperature of 60°C at the oil-water contact. The oil&#13;
pour point is at about 320C.&#13;
4.    Reserves. Uzen had produced about 245 million tons of oil (294 million m3) as of the&#13;
end of 1992. This represents about 23% of the estimated 1099 million tons (1308 million m3'&#13;
of oil-in-place.  According to Consultants engaged to undertake a reservoir assessment,&#13;
remaining reserve estimates (as at end 1992) are as follows, depending upon the level of well&#13;
restoration activity that is achieved:&#13;
Remaining Reserves (10' i3)       % OOIP                   Level of Activity&#13;

Taking into account recommendations presented by Ernst and Young on restructuring of the PA&#13;
UMG and its financial options, and upon analyzing operational activities of each of the subsidiaries,&#13;
management of the JSC UMG jointly with the principal specialists have prepared an operations&#13;
restructuring and manpower optimization plan. In this Restructuring Plan it is envisioned that all&#13;
economic activities of the enterprise will be consolidated into the following seven functional units&#13;
(blocks):&#13;
*      [Core] Operational activities;&#13;
*     Well workovers and drilling;&#13;
*     Well services;&#13;
*     Gas production and processing;&#13;
*     Capital construction;&#13;
*     Public utility and municipal services;&#13;

UZEN OIL FIELD REHABIUTATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 4.3&#13;
SURFACE PRODUCTION/INFRASTRUCTURE FACILTiTES&#13;
1.    The surface production facilities are composed of two major systems, i.e. oil processing and&#13;
water injection (WI) systems. Electric power is supplied from the Akltau power station though a 150 Km&#13;
high voltage transmission line. In the field, there are 70 oil cluster stations where well fluid is collected&#13;
and measured, and one central oil processing plant. At present, the degassed and de-watered oil is&#13;
pumped up at the central plant and transferred to the Uzen-Atyrau pipeline owned by Yuzhnefteprod (or&#13;
South Pipeline) Company. Uzen oil is mixed with other oils in western Kazakstan making so-called&#13;
Kazak Blend.&#13;
2.     Oil Production System. Well fluid from each well is sent to the nearest cluster station which is&#13;
located at 300 to 500m away from individual oil wells. Where sucker rod pumps are used, the well head&#13;
flowing pressure is about 5 atm and at the other wells where gas lift is applied, the pressure is maintained&#13;
at some 20 atm. The well head flowing temperature is around 70°C. Two inch flow lines stretch some&#13;
2,100 km in total. At the cluster stations, the well fluid is periodically measured per each well for its&#13;
total liquid flow rate by a two-barrel type two-phase separator. At each cluster station, a direct heater&#13;
firing on gas is equipped to heat up again the cooled well fluid from 45°C to about 70°C. The associated&#13;
gas is segregated in a 50 m' two- phase separator and the gas is mainly used for line heating. The&#13;
degassed oil is pumped up by several reciprocating pumps and transported to the central processing plant.&#13;
Twenty (20) inch gathering lines stretch some 800 km. At the central processing plant, the well fluid is&#13;
first brought in to Free-water Knock-out Drums where produced water content is basically segregated.&#13;
The oil is next transferred to direct heaters where the oil is heated up from some 40 to 450C to 700C.&#13;
Just upstream the heaters, de-emulsifier chemical is injected to enhance separation of the produced water&#13;
from the oil. The nearly dehydrated oil is then sent to the elevated atmospheric separators where the&#13;
vapor pressure of the oil is lowered to maximum 500 mmHg. The associated gas from the separators&#13;
is very small in volume and is flared. The produced water is supposed to be recycled and used as a part&#13;
of WI water. Final separation of the produced water takes place in two 20,000 m' tanks. The dehydrated&#13;
oil is then shifted to sales tanks with 10,000 ml volume from which sales oil is pumped up to some 40&#13;
atm pressure and sent to a 1,020 mm diameter oil pipeline to Guriev. At the central plant, a piping&#13;
flexibility is provided to heat up first the oil from cluster stations if the arriving temperature is close to&#13;
the pour point of the oil (about 357).&#13;
3.    Water Injection System. For the Uzen oil field, sea water from the Caspian Sea is primarily used&#13;
as injection water'. At present, the sea water intake is provided in Aktau city and 5,000 m3/hr of sea&#13;
water is transported to Uzen using a total 150 km of 1,020 mm diameter pipeline. There is no water&#13;
treatment unit nor corrosion protection unit. In the Uzen field, there are 17 high pressure pumping&#13;
stations where the WI water is pressurized up to between 108 and 142 atm. Although it is not used due&#13;
to shortage of gas fuel, a direct heater firing on gas is provided downstream of the high pressure pumps&#13;
at each WI pump station to heat up the water up to 75°C. There are a total of 1,434 injection wells.&#13;
Four (4) inch diameter injection lines stretch about 1,200 km in total.&#13;
1. More than 70% of the injection water is sea water.&#13;

ANNEX 6.1&#13;
RECENT WELLs PERFORMANCE&#13;
1.    As of end-June 1995 there were a total of 2984 wells operationally active in the Uzen oil&#13;
field. These consist of:&#13;
Oil producing wells              2040&#13;
Water injection wells             944&#13;
2.    The fluid production profile of the producing wells was as follows:&#13;
Fluid Production Range        No. of Wells     % of Total Wells&#13;
less than 5 tons/day             418                20&#13;
from 5 to 10 tons/day            509                25&#13;
from 10 to 20 tons/day           600                29&#13;
more than 20 tons/day            513                26&#13;
Total Producing Wells           2040               100&#13;
3.    By comparison, the wells distribution of fluid production in Block 3A is as follows:&#13;
Fluid Production Range        No. of Wells     % of Total Wells&#13;
less than 5 tons/day              43                21&#13;
from 5 to 10 tons/day             28                14&#13;
from 10 to 20 tons/day            52                26&#13;
more than 20 tons/day             80                39&#13;
Total Producing Wells            203                100&#13;
4.    Of the 418 wells fieldwide which produce less than 5 tons/day, 41 wells produce with&#13;
less than 20% water cut; 194 wells produce with water cuts between 20% and 50%; 155 wells&#13;
produce with water cut between 50% and 90% water cut; and 28 wells produce with more than&#13;
90% water cut (see Table No. 1 below). This water cut production profile is also reflected in&#13;
similar proportions in Blocks and its adjacent block, Block 3A (Table No. 1).&#13;

5.    It is significant to note that about 86% (1750/2040) of the wells in the Uzen Oil Filed,&#13;
and 87% (339/390) in Blocks 3 and 3A, produce with water cuts between 20% and 90%.&#13;
Therefore, most of these wells would be likely candidates for workover programs which would&#13;
be designed for reducing the amount of water and increase the volume of oil produced from each&#13;
well.&#13;
6.    Wells that produce with water cuts in excess of 90%, and with productivity of less than&#13;
5 ton/day of fluid, would require a closer review of the geological data in order to determine&#13;
the type of workover necessary to rehabilitate them to an economic rate of production.&#13;
7.    Most of the water injection wells in Block 3A and Block 3 are capable of injecting water&#13;
in excess of 210 cubic meters per day. Therefore, prior to workover programs being started,&#13;
it wi1l be necessary to determine that the water being injected is actually entering the targeted&#13;
reservoir, and not channeling upward into formations above or downward into the water phase&#13;
of the reservoir, without contribution to good reservoir management.&#13;

REPuBLIc OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
UZEN OIL FILD REHABITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 6.3&#13;
SURFACE REHABILITATION COMPONENT: DETAnIED DESCRIPrlON&#13;
The main elements of the surface facilities rehabilitation are as follows:&#13;
(a)  Replacement of about 340* flowlines between production wells and gathering&#13;
stations.&#13;
(b) Relocation of satellites and integration of the existing gathering stations into about&#13;
8 stations with test and group separators and associated flow measuring and control&#13;
equipment.&#13;
(c)  Replacement of oiVwater transfer lines between gathering stations and the existing&#13;
central processing plant and installation of new produced water transfer lines from&#13;
the new gathering stations to the water injection station in Block 3A.&#13;
(d) Modification of the existing processing plant to establish a dedicated process train&#13;
for crude oil produced from Block 3A.&#13;
(e)  Installation of a complete water treatment system at the water injection pump station&#13;
in Block 3A.&#13;
(f)  Replacement of the existing water injection pumps, high pressure water injection&#13;
lines between the water pump station and injection wells with associated flow&#13;
measurement and control equipment.&#13;
(g)  Replacement of high pressure water injection line system between water injection&#13;
stations and injection wells with associated flow measuring and control equipment.&#13;
(h)  Corrosion control of all new facilities.&#13;
Note (*): The actual number of wells and well numbers will be determined during the well testing which will take&#13;
place in the earliest stage of the whole rehabilitation project.&#13;
2.    Flowline Systems&#13;
The flowlines connected to those wells determined as productive by the well testing program will&#13;
be replaced by new flowlines. The number of such wells are expected about 340 within Block 3A.&#13;
2.1   Flowlines&#13;
The produced oil from each well will be connected to one of eight (8) gathering stations by 88.9&#13;
mm (3 in.) individual flowlines. If the total length exceeds 1 Km, use 4 inch pipes. Thermal insulation&#13;
should be provided so as to avoid wax crystallization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.3                                                                             113&#13;
The flowlines will be buried and coated on the outside with anti-corrosive paint. The pipe used&#13;
is steel pipe, ASTM-A-106 Grade B or API-5L or equivalent or better and designed per ANSI B3 1.4 with&#13;
minimum 3 mm corrosion allowance and the inside surface is coated for protection from corrosive water.&#13;
The flowlines are designed to withstand a 6897 kPaG operating pressure which allows&#13;
considerable cushion for handling oil/water/gas flow interruptions before the oil starts to cool.&#13;
Alternatively, fiberglass reinforced piping (FRP) could be used. In this case, coating and catholic&#13;
protection are irrelevant. However, the design importance is endurance against external forces at road&#13;
crossings including provision of external casing pipes, etc. Valve flanges on a wellhead are tie-ins points&#13;
at a well site. Pumping liquid and gas are mixed together after these are released from an outlet of a&#13;
wellhead and flows into an underground flowline. A piping between the tie-in points and the flowline&#13;
is provided with a check valve on the outlet line.&#13;
Each flowline is provided with a high-low pressure shut-down valve near each of well heads and&#13;
a check valve and a block valve at a tie-in to a manifold in a gathering stations. These prevent back flow&#13;
in the event of a flowline rupture and enable individual flowlines to be isolated without interrupting&#13;
production from remaining wells.&#13;
The flowlines are laid under the underground obstacles such as the existing flowlines, water&#13;
injection lines, cables, etc. The existing replaced flowlines are demolished and transported to as&#13;
designated area in Uzen after oil inside are purged appropriately. Following installation of each flowline,&#13;
the line is hydro-statically tested and cleaned before precommissioning the system. The flowlines are then&#13;
tied-in to the wellhead at each well site and to the manifold in the gathering station.&#13;
3.    Satellites and Gathering Stations&#13;
The existing satellite consists of testing manifold and test separator. One well is selected and led&#13;
to test separator where liquid (oil and water) production rates are measured periodically. Fluid from test&#13;
separator and other wells by-passed test separator are mixed and fed to group separators in gathering&#13;
station. Production fluid from wells is separated in gas and liquid by using group separator. Liquid from&#13;
group separator is measured and pumped to the central processing plant. No measurement is made for&#13;
gas production.&#13;
The present function of satellite will be transferred to gathering stations to operate separator in&#13;
the same place. New test separators and new group separators will be installed in gathering stations with&#13;
sophisticated measuring and control equipment. The number of gathering stations will be reduced to eight&#13;
(8) stations' in the two blocks to operate and maintain the stations more efficiently.&#13;
A maximum of about 50 wells, an average of 42 wells flow to a gathering station. Three&#13;
manifold, three test separators, one group separator, one gas scrubber (in principle, reuse of the&#13;
existing vessels with proper rehabilitation), two oil transfer pumps (one stand-by), two produced&#13;
water transfer pumps (one stand-by), a chemical injection unit and minimum required utility&#13;
systems will be installed in each gathering station.&#13;
3.1    Manifolds&#13;
Production from each well is led to one of the new three manifolds and fed to one of the&#13;
new three test separators or to the new group separator.&#13;
The tentatively identified gathering station numbers are: 1, 7, 12, 13, 52, 54, 55 and 57.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114                                                                          Annex 6.3&#13;
3.2   Test Separators&#13;
These test separators are three phase separators with a minimum 3 minute liquid retention&#13;
time. The gas is segregated from liquid in the test separator, and the flow is measured before&#13;
passing to a gas scrubber. The pressure of the test separator is controlled by the pressure&#13;
control valve that is equipped downstream of the separator on the gas outlet lines. The flow rate&#13;
of the oil outlet from the test separator is measured. The water content of the oil outlet is&#13;
analyzed continuously by the analyzer equipped on the line. The flow of the water outlet from&#13;
the test separator is also measured. The oil and water are mixed together again and led to the&#13;
group separator.&#13;
3.3   Group Separator/Gas Scrubber/Oil Transfer Pump/Production Heater&#13;
The group separators are three phase separators. The separators are designed based on&#13;
a minimum 7 minute liquid retention time. The gas is segregated from the liquid in the&#13;
separator and mixed with gas from the test separator and led to the gas scrubber. This gas rate&#13;
is measured at the down stream of the gas scrubber. The pressure of the production and the gas&#13;
scrubber is controlled by the pressure control valve that is equipped downstream of the gas&#13;
scrubber. The flow rates of oil (with emulsified water) and free water from the group separator&#13;
are measured. The oil is pumped to the existing processing plant through the new oil transfer&#13;
line. The rate of transferring the oil is controlled by the flow control valve by the signal of the&#13;
group separator's liquid level. Each group station has two 100% pumps, one running and one&#13;
stand-by. The oil is heated up by a direct fired type production heater just before entering the&#13;
oil/water transfer line. The free water produced from the group separator is transferred to the&#13;
new water treatment unit at the water injection pump station in Block 3A. Each group station&#13;
has two 100% pumps, one running and one stand-by.&#13;
3.4   Chemical Injection&#13;
A corrosion-cum scale inhibitor injection package is provided at each gathering station. This&#13;
package injects inhibitor at maximum dosing rate of 100 ppm2 based on producing water and&#13;
continues to inject for one week without any additional supply of inhibitor.&#13;
3.5   Utilities&#13;
All the electric, control and monitoring systems, and an instrument air package required&#13;
for operations of each gathering station will be installed.&#13;
The fuel gas for the production heaters is introduced from the gas scrubbers, and&#13;
necessary systems are to be installed. If necessary, gas supply lines are extended from the&#13;
existing gas distribution.&#13;
3.6   Buildings&#13;
One control building with a workshop/storage will be constructed in each gathering&#13;
station.&#13;
2 The rate is subject to confirmation by the Contractor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.3                                                                     115&#13;
3.7   Location and Number of Gathering Station and wells&#13;
Approximately eight (8) gathering stations are assumed. (See the footnote of Paragraph&#13;
3.3.) An average of 42 wells will be connected to each station. The final locations of the new&#13;
gathering stations shall be determined during the detailed design phase.&#13;
4.    Oil Transfer Lines, Produced Water Transfer Lines and Gas Lines&#13;
4.1   Oil Transfer Lines&#13;
The oil separated from gas and free water at the group separator in each gathering station&#13;
is pumped by the oil transfer pump through a pipeline to the existing processing plant. The oil&#13;
transfer lines are buried and coated on the outside with anti-corrosion paint. The pipe used is&#13;
steel pipe, ASTM-A-106 Grade B or API-5L or equivalent or better and is to be designed per&#13;
ANSI B31.4 with minimum 3 mm corrosion allowance. The pipelines withstand a 6897 kPaG&#13;
operating pressure which provides allowance for handling oil flow interruptions before the oil&#13;
starts to cool.&#13;
Alternatively, fiberglass reinforced piping (FRP) could be used. In this case, coating and&#13;
cathodic protection are irrelevant. However, the design should consider endurance against&#13;
external forces at road crossings including provision of external casing pipes, etc.&#13;
4.2   Produced Water Transfer Lines&#13;
The free water segregated from the group separators will be transferred to the water&#13;
treatment plant at the water injection pump station in Block 3A by Produced Water Transfer&#13;
Pumps at the gathering stations. The water transfer lines are buried and coated on the outside&#13;
with anti-corrosion paint. The pipe used is steel pipe, ASTM-A-106 Grade B or API-5L or&#13;
equivalent or better and is to be designed per ANSI B31.4 with minimum 3 mm corrosion&#13;
allowance.&#13;
Alternatively, fiberglass reinforced piping (FRP) could be used. In this case, coating and&#13;
cathodic protection are irrelevant. However, the design should consider endurance against&#13;
external forces at road crossings including provision of external casing pipes, etc.&#13;
4.3   Gas Lines&#13;
The gas segregated at the group separator in each gathering station is first used as fuel&#13;
for the oil heaters at the gathering stations. If any surplus, the gas is transferred to the existing&#13;
pipelines to the existing processing plant.&#13;
5.    Modification of Existing Processing Plant&#13;
5.1   Process Train&#13;
A dedicated process train to treat the crude oil from Block 3A will be installed. The&#13;
train will consist of: one Inlet Heater, one Free Water Knock-out Drum, one Demulsifier&#13;
Chemical Injection Unit, two Oil Feed Pumps (one stand-by) and one second stage separator.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116                                                                       Annex 6.3&#13;
Although piping isolation is made from other trains, it is intended to reuse the existing facilities&#13;
as far as practical. Subject to bidders' evaluation, the shell for the Inlet Heater and the vessel&#13;
of the second stage separator could be reuse of the existing units.&#13;
5.2   Utilities&#13;
All the electric, control and monitoring systems, and an instrument air package required&#13;
for operations will be installed. If necessary, a gas supply line would be extended from the&#13;
existing gas distribution to the Inlet Heater.&#13;
5.3   Buildings&#13;
Basically, the space of the existing buildings will be used and will be renovated as&#13;
required.&#13;
6.    Water Injection Station&#13;
6.1   Produced Water Treatment Plant&#13;
The produced water treatment plant to produce injection water will be installed at the&#13;
water injection pump station in Block 3A, including utilities for both the gas blanket system and&#13;
the water treatment package.&#13;
It is assumed that the produced water treatment system consists of: one Gas Floatator&#13;
(which removes oil particles); one Settling Tank, two Water Feed Pumps (one stand-by); one&#13;
set of Sand Filter Unit with back washing; one Chemical Injection Unit (which will dose such&#13;
chemicals as scale inhibitor, corrosion inhibitor, oxygen scavenger and biocide); and one gas&#13;
stripping type Deaerator. At the outlet of the water heater down stream of the water injection&#13;
pumps, a set of cartridge type Fine Filter will be provided.&#13;
The requirement for the water treatment package shall be as follows:&#13;
Treatment Rate                 4500 m3/d&#13;
Stream Factor                  24 hours and 365 days operation&#13;
Output Quality                 pH - 7 to 8&#13;
Solid - less than 2 mg/I&#13;
Oxygen - 0.5 mg/l&#13;
Minimum Pressure at&#13;
Water Stations                 100 kPaG&#13;
The design and operating pressures need to be confirmed by the CONTRACTOR&#13;
considering the conditions of the existing facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.3                                                                     117&#13;
The input quality of the produced water is assumed as follows:&#13;
pH                             5.0&#13;
Specific Gravity               1.11 gm/cm&#13;
Solid                          40 mg/i&#13;
Oxygen                         1.0 mg/l&#13;
Oil Content                    1,000 ppm&#13;
6.2   Water Injection Pumps&#13;
One water injection station will be constructed in Block 3A to inject water at the&#13;
maximum requirement of 4,500 m3/day. Two water injection pumps with a capacity of 200&#13;
m3/h at suction pressure of 59 kPaG and discharge pressure of 13790 kPaG are assumed. The&#13;
number includes one stand-by pump. The injection water is heated by a water heater up to 60&#13;
centigrade and distributed to the water injection lines.&#13;
6.3   Utilities&#13;
All the electric, control and monitoring systems, and an instrument air package required&#13;
for operations will be installed. A gas supply lines are extended from the existing gas&#13;
distribution.&#13;
6.4   Buildings&#13;
One control building with a workshop/storage will be constructed in each gathering&#13;
station.&#13;
7.    High Pressure Water Injection Systems&#13;
There will be some 60 active injection wells in Block 3A. Injection water shall be fed&#13;
from the water injection station to these injection wells via headers and individual high pressure&#13;
injection lines. The existing high pressure water injection lines are severely corroded. The&#13;
complete replacement of the high pressure water injection is required in Block 3A.&#13;
7.1   High Pressure Water Injection Lines&#13;
The high pressure water injection lines are buried and coated on the outside with anti-&#13;
corrosion paint. The pipe used is steel pipe, ASTM-A-106 Grade B or API-5L equivalent or&#13;
better and is to be designed per ANSI B31.4 with minimum of 3 mm corrosion allowance. The&#13;
pipes are buried and cathodic protection is provided. A flow meter and a choke valve (which&#13;
will adjust the injection pressure) are required at upstream of each injection well.&#13;
Alternatively, fiberglass reinforced piping (FRP) could be used. In this case, coating and&#13;
cathodic protection are irrelevant. However, the design should consider endurance against&#13;
external forces at road crossings including provision of external casing pipes, etc.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT&#13;
DRAFr SUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
OBJECTIVE&#13;
1.    The objective of the assignment will be establishment of a comprehensive database of&#13;
existing environmental conditions in the Block 3A in order to do the following:&#13;
(a)  provide baseline data against which both positive and possible negative&#13;
environmental impacts of the project, including mitigation and remediation&#13;
measures, will be recorded;&#13;
(b)  develop audit methodology which could be replicated in other parts of the field; and&#13;
(c)  provide initial input into future Uzenmunaigas environmental information and&#13;
management system.&#13;
STUDY AREA&#13;
2.    The study area for the environmental audit is Block 3A of the Uzen field, encompassing&#13;
an area of about 7.5 square kilometers. It contains about 370 production wells, about 100 water&#13;
flood injection wells as well as associated gathering lines, field processing facilities, water&#13;
injection facilities, field worker housing, access roads and pipelines to the central field processing&#13;
facility. The terrain is generally flat with few remains of the original desert vegetation. The area&#13;
has very disturbed soil and vegetation cover with extensive areas subject to disturbance from&#13;
vehicle traffic and production activity and areas containing pits of oil/sludge, as well as scrap&#13;
metal and other oil field wastes.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
3.    Under the assignment, the consultants will collect and store data related to both sources&#13;
of pollution and their impacts on air, water and soil quality, flora, fauna, and human health and&#13;
safety. In particular, the consultants will accurately locate and estimate the (a) quality and&#13;
quantity of hydrocarbon contaminated soil; (b) oil/sludge pits; and (c) nature of the scrap metal&#13;
and other oil field wastes. The consultants will also map the distribution and types of vegetation&#13;
cover and the location and types of land disturbances within Block IIA. The consultants should&#13;
design this data collection in relation to the location of the production and injection wells,&#13;
gathering system, field processing facilities as well as the main access roads.&#13;
4.    The consultants will measure the levels of radio-activity associated with oil field&#13;
production equipment and with oil/sludge pits on Block 3A.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.4                                                                       121&#13;
5.    Prior to data collection, the consultant will undertake, possibly through local&#13;
subcontractors, an aerial photographic survey of the entire field and adjacent territories to be used&#13;
as the basis for the audit planning and implementation and the initial data set for which studies&#13;
are to be performed under another subcomponent of the project environmental component. Data&#13;
acquired during such a survey, should be interpreted and presented as a photomap.&#13;
6.    The consultants will summarize results of the field work in a draft report, supported by&#13;
relevant maps, diagrams, tables and other necessary graphic supplements. This draft report will&#13;
be presented in English and Russian to the Project Management Group's (PMG) environmental&#13;
coordinator.  Copies of the report should be circulated for review  to Uzenmunaigas'&#13;
environmental unit, the environmental division of Ministry of Oil and Gas, the Uzen Committee&#13;
on Environment within the Ministry of Ecology and other agencies, as specified by the PMG&#13;
environmental coordinator.&#13;
7.    Upon incorporation of comments received from the agencies mentioned in above. the&#13;
consultants will prepare of the final report in English and Russian.&#13;
CONSULTANTS EXPERIENCE&#13;
8.    The consultants' personnel proposed for this assignment must possess a broad international&#13;
experience in environmental audit of oil field operations, according to internationally accepted&#13;
environmental and safety standards and procedures. Work experience in the FSU and familiarity&#13;
with FSU oil production operations and their environrnental aspects will be highly desirable. It&#13;
is expected that this assignment will be performed with maximum practical use of local&#13;
personnel/subcontractors.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
UZEN OIL FIELD REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 6.5&#13;
WELLS TESTING PROGRAM&#13;
1.    Oil and gas production operators world wide depend on the services of Coiled Tubing&#13;
Unit (CTU) contractors using "state of the art" technology to service and revitalize previously&#13;
uneconomical oil and gas producing wells, thus obtaining maximum production efficiency from&#13;
their existing wells.&#13;
2.    The proven workover method which has been used for over twenty-five (25) years by the&#13;
oil production industry to clean out and repair their wells has been with the use of coiled tubing&#13;
units. These units have been used effectively, without having to pull the tubing, nor have they&#13;
caused any damage to the tubing, casing or liner in the performance of the following services:&#13;
(a)   sand washing from the bottom of the well;&#13;
(b)   bottomhole fluid displacement, for well treatment;&#13;
(c)   paraffin removal by mechanical methods and by the application of chemicals for&#13;
paraffin suppression, or heat;&#13;
(d)   spotting mud clean out acids across perforated interval, for well stimulation;&#13;
(e)   unloading heavy drilling fluids that are in wells, after their completion, with&#13;
lighter fluids to place same on production for flow testing or into commercial&#13;
production;&#13;
(f)   through tubing fishing operations.&#13;
3.    In addition, recent technological developments have allowed oil and gas operators to&#13;
revitalize old wells by drilling out, from the existing wells which have depleted the nearby&#13;
surrounding reservoir, at a very high angle of deviation, and in some cases, horizontally, in an&#13;
attempt to reach out to produced additional oil or gas from zones which have not produced any&#13;
of its oil or gas, due to existing permeability barriers within the reservoir.&#13;
4.    The use of coiled tubing units permits oil and gas operators to eliminate the use of&#13;
expensive workover rigs to clean out wells for testing, particularly in wells where an operator is&#13;
not fully knowledgeable of the existing well conditions nor its eventual productive capacity.&#13;
5.    Since the coiled tubing operations are performed on wells without the need to kill it, the&#13;
following are the most significant advantages in using this technology:&#13;
(a)   elimination of formation damage, since bullheading of kill fluids into the reservoir&#13;
is not necessary;&#13;
(b)   reducing the time to ascertain the well workover/repair program  that will&#13;
eventually need to be executed in the well;&#13;
(c)   a very high success ratio in their operations;&#13;
(d)   low workover equipment cost; and,&#13;
(e)   reduced well maintenance cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.5                                                                       123&#13;
6.    In view of the above, it is recommended that a well testing program. be instituted in the&#13;
Uzen Oil Field in accordance with the procedure outlined below:&#13;
OBJECTIVE&#13;
7.    The objective for testing some 400 Uzen Oil Field wells in Block 3A, using a coiled&#13;
tubing unit, a well test separator, a hot oil truck and other associated equipment is to reduce the&#13;
project risk by determining and establishing:&#13;
(a)   the ranking of the wells for their eventual workover in Block 3A of the Uzen Oil&#13;
Field and other selected blocks which will be part of the Bank project;&#13;
(b)   actual well productivity;&#13;
(c)   incremental productivity which can be successfully maintained by the wells, after&#13;
their clean out and workover;&#13;
(d)   workover program to be designed for each well; and&#13;
(e)   operational requirements which need to be implemented by the operator to assure&#13;
long term project sustainability.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
8.    After agreement on the selection of the wells to be tested for their productivity, a work&#13;
schedule needs to be established. Early selection of the Coiled Tubing Unit Contractor will permit&#13;
the contractor to muster and mobilize the necessary resources, equipment, materials and&#13;
technicians to effectively perform the services required.&#13;
9.    Prior to commencing operations, it will be necessary for the Uzen Oil Field Operator to&#13;
(i) for those wells which are on production: the operator must prepare the wells by pulling the&#13;
sucker rods, pump. and standing valve (in wells so equipped and leaving the wells without&#13;
mechanical obstructions (tool traps,and other obstructions such as the standing valve in those&#13;
wells where the pump barrel is part of the production string), thus allowing the testing contractor&#13;
to run the coiled tubing down to the well's TD (total depth); (ii) for those wells which are not&#13;
on production and have no down hole equipment or mechanical obstruction: the well testing&#13;
contractor can proceed to rig-up at any time.&#13;
10.   The following is a brief detail of the operations, subject to confirmation, which will be&#13;
required from the CTU contractor:&#13;
(a)   Rig up on well, remove pumping stuffing box and nipple up CTU blowout&#13;
preventors on wellhead.&#13;
(b)   Run in the hole to the TD of each well with CTU while circulating "hot oil" at a&#13;
rate of at least half (1/2) barrel per minute.&#13;
(c)   Clean out bottom fines and sand which has accumulated below the perforated&#13;
interval, if necessary.&#13;
(d)   Circulate the well with "hot oil" for at least ten (10) or twelve (12) complete well&#13;
volumes, depending on well productivity.&#13;
(e)   Circulated fluid together with the produced fluids from the well will be flowed&#13;
through a portable three phase separator with a design capacity of some 500 to&#13;
750 barrel/day and working pressure not to exceed 750 psi.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
124                                                                       Annex 6.5&#13;
(f)   Fluids from the separator will be measured and discharged as follows:&#13;
*     The separated oil will be discharged into a trip tank for confirmation of&#13;
incremental production, where it will be recycled into the heating unit (hot oil&#13;
truck) and used as part of the working fluid in the process.&#13;
**    The separated water will be collected in a separate tank and disposed of in an&#13;
environmentally acceptable manner. It is suggested, at this time, that disposal of&#13;
the produced water be made by trucking fluid to the nearest salt water injection&#13;
station for disposal.&#13;
***   The liberated separator gas will be flared, if necessary.&#13;
(g)   Incremental oil accumulated and measured in the trip tank and not used as part of&#13;
the working fluid will be transferred to existing production facilities through the&#13;
well's flowline.&#13;
(h)   Upon completion of test program, all incremental oil and working oil can be&#13;
disposed of by pumping into existing well's flowlines.&#13;
(i)   Pull CTU out of hole, rig down blowout preventor and nipple up well pumping&#13;
stuffing box and release the well.&#13;
NOTE:       Due to the relative shallow depth of the Uzen Oil Field wells (less than 1500&#13;
meters), and the small diameter of the production casing, (5 1/2" OD), it is&#13;
estimated that the volume of oilfor workingfluid to be circulated to be around 20&#13;
barrels, including the volume of oil in the "hot oil truck". Most wells in the field&#13;
are equipped with plunger pumps set in 2 3/8" tubing run down to around 1200&#13;
meters well depth.&#13;
EQuIPMENT REQUIREMENTS&#13;
11.   A list of equipment which is expected to be used, subject to confirmation by the&#13;
contractor, is the following:&#13;
(a)   Coiled Tubing Unit equipped with not less that 8000 feet of 1" or 1 1/4" tubing;&#13;
(b)   High pressure circulating pump, with a capacity of pumping no less than 25&#13;
gallons per minute at 2000 psi;&#13;
(c)   Blow out preventor;&#13;

per day and a working pressure not above 700 psi.;&#13;
(h)   All associated piping and manifolding; and&#13;
(i)    Chemical injection pumps for injection of paraffin suppressing chemicals or&#13;
foaming agents in order to reduce the bottomhole pressure, if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.5                                                                    .125&#13;
12.  In addition, due to unexpected circumstance which may be encountered in the wells, and&#13;
due to the nature of the well test and for reporting purposes, the contractor may be required to&#13;
have available for immediate use the following:&#13;
(a)   A nitrogen or inert gas generator for completely unloading the well, should well&#13;
not produce;&#13;
(b)   A number of down hole motors and bits;&#13;

ANNEX 6.6&#13;
PROPOSED WORKOVER PROGRAM&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The following is a summary description of the workover program. A technical statement&#13;
of equipment and material requirements to undertake the program is given in Annex 6.2.&#13;
2.    It is estimated that the proposed program, entailing the workover of about 400 producer&#13;
wells, will require some net 2800 rig days of services (from both workover rigs, and technical&#13;
services) and could effectively be carried out by rigs working under an alliance of service&#13;
contractors, managed by a suitably qualified and experienced rigs services contractor.&#13;
3.    The alliance of service contractors will furnish all of the technical services required, ---&#13;
cased hole logging, perforating, cementing, and workover rig services---under the umbrella of a&#13;
single contract. This single responsibility approach would avoid delays and additional costs for&#13;
waiting time, and would ensure the effective coordination of all of the related services and&#13;
operating logistics.&#13;
4.    The primary contractor, for the alliance the rigs service operator, will have responsibility&#13;
for carrying out the project in an expeditious manner, using good oil field practices and "state of&#13;
the art" technology.&#13;
5.    The rigs service operator will furnish the camp facilities to house and cater to the needs&#13;
of all of the alliance's personnel. They will also store, on behalf of Uzenmunaigas, all of the&#13;
well equipment and consumables such as cement, perforating explosives, tubing, sucker rods,&#13;
polished rods, downhole pumps, wellheads and stuffing boxes and other materials needed for the&#13;
project and which will be financed under the project.&#13;
6     Uzenmunaigas will undertake the following: (a) furnish and permit the alliance use of&#13;
a designated land area for the installation of camp and storage facilities; (b) supply of fuel and&#13;
water for the operation; (c) assist in the acquisition of all the necessary permits for establishing&#13;
reliable intemational communications facilities and network; (d) obtain all the necessary permits&#13;
and authorizations for the execution of each well program to be followed on each well; (e) obtain&#13;
the necessary permits for the repair access roads to each well location; and (f) ensure the&#13;
acquisition of all other government and official permits which are necessary for the operator to&#13;
perform his duties diligently.&#13;
7.    In addition, Uzenrnunaigas, through a Project Management Group, will supervise the&#13;
operations to ensure compliance with the work program, and ensure that the contractor follows&#13;
good oil field practices throughout its operations.&#13;
8.    Uzenmunaigas will also have the responsibility to designate a secured area for the proper&#13;
disposal of hazardous wastes in an ecologically sound manner, and for the temporary storage of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.6                                                                       127&#13;
all explosive materials, such as detonators, primer cord, shape charges and power charges, and&#13;
radioactive sources used in the project.&#13;
9.    The Project Management Group within Uzenmunaigas will prepare a schedule and a&#13;
workover program for each well to be subject to workover. The schedule should include work&#13;
for each rig for a period of at least three months in order to allow the rig operator to prepare the&#13;
access roads and well site for the rigs.&#13;
(a)   Rig up on designated well. Rig down existing wellhead and rig up drilling BOP&#13;
stack (3000 psi. working pressure).&#13;
(b)   Pull out of the hole sucker rods and pump.&#13;
(c)   Pull out of the hole existing tubing and pump landing nipple.&#13;
(d)   Test BOP stack to its working pressure.&#13;
(e)   Run in the hole with work string consisting of a bottom hole assembly of drill bit,&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
UZEN OIL FIELD REHABILTATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 7.7&#13;
RISK ANALYSIS: MONTE CARLO SIMULATION OF OIL PIuCES&#13;
1.    The economic evaluation in the main text has been performed based on a constant&#13;
nominal oil price (adjusted after Year 2000 to drift implicitly in line with "international"&#13;
inflation). Given the observed pattem of oil prices, this assumption is convenient but clearly&#13;
not very realistic. However, the standard alternative approach of assuming a linear trend growth&#13;
in oil prices is equally unrealistic and less conservative.&#13;
2.    To assess the impact on the economics of the project of a more realistic price pattern for&#13;
crude oil, a Monte Carlo simulation of oil prices was performed based on the following&#13;
assumptions:&#13;
(a)   the international (Brent marker) price of crude oil follows geometric Brownian&#13;
motion with an assumed drift rate of four (4) percent per annum and a standard&#13;
deviation of 15 percent per annum. The assumed mean annual rate of growth in&#13;
oil prices is consistent with current consensus projections of the medium-term rate&#13;
of growth in crude oil prices and EBRD mral oil price projections. Historic&#13;
medium term estimates of the volatility of crude oil prices vary from 15 to 25&#13;
percent per annum. The oil price is modelled by the following equation:&#13;
oP+ lI = OP x e[(,u - % a.) X a e (a xx d;J]&#13;
where OP   =    oil price&#13;
1f    =    drift rate of oil price&#13;
at    =    time between period t and period (t + 1)&#13;
r    =    standard deviation of oil price&#13;
dz    =    a drawing from a standard normal distribution with mean&#13;
of zero and standard deviation of one;&#13;
(b)   the oil price at the start of the period is assumed at US$120.5 per ton and is&#13;
revised monthly;&#13;
(c)   there is a fixed proportional relationship between the international oil price and&#13;
domestic and regional export oil prices based on the current ratio of such prices;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)   oil transport costs to international markets (for sales to international markets)&#13;
remain constant in nominal terms at the current (October 1995) level.&#13;
3.    The Monte Carlo simulation was implemented through random drawings from a standard&#13;
normal distribution to generate a price path for oil through the 17-year life of the project. Ten&#13;
thousand iterations of a price path for oil were run.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7.7                                                                            159&#13;
4.    The distribution of the net present value of the project based on the result of this&#13;
simulation is illustrated in the attached graphs. The results indicate that the project expected&#13;
returns are robust based on a plausible characterization of the price of crude oil. The mean of&#13;
the NPV (at 12%) of the project is US$177 million. The probability of a negative NPV is about&#13;
5 percent. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the NPV increases by about 0.12 standard deviations&#13;
for every unit increase in the standard deviation of the price of oil.&#13;
5.    The Monte Carlo simulation of oil prices has also been extended to gain an insight into&#13;
the cost of hedging against adverse price developments while benefitting from favorable ones,&#13;
i.e. avoiding oil price-induced unfavorable NPV outcomes, other things being equal.&#13;
6.    One way of hedging against adverse oil price developments is to purchase an option to&#13;
sell oil at an average of oil prices over any given year that is no less than a specified level. For&#13;
example, a series of options to sell oil (in any given year through the life of the project) at an&#13;
average price that is equivalent to the well head prices that are projected in the economic&#13;
evaluation (Chapter 7) would, other things being equal, ensure that a minimum ERR of 38%&#13;
would be achieved. Average rate options of the type discussed above (so-called Asian options)&#13;
are widely available in international financial markets.&#13;
7.    For illustrative purposes, the value of an Asian put option has been assessed. Using the&#13;
same price formation assumption (geometric Brownian motion) as above, the cost of an Asian&#13;
put option to lock in an average implicit international oil price of no less than US$120.5 per ton&#13;
over one year was estimated. In line with standard option valuation procedures, the oil price was&#13;
assumed to grow at the estimated one-year risk-free rate (6% per annum) adjusted for a&#13;
convenience yield (estimated from crude oil futures prices on the International Petroleum&#13;
Exchange in January 1996-') of 8% per annum . The discounted pay-off from a put option at the&#13;
end of the year was calculated based on the difference between the average oil price over the year&#13;
and the exercise price of US$120.5 per ton.   The fair price of an option was derived as the&#13;
arithmetic mean of the discounted pay-offs after 10,000 iterations for three different degrees of&#13;
volatility. The results of the simulations are summarized below:&#13;
Value of          Value of Option as&#13;
Volatility     Average Put Option    Proportion of Opening&#13;
($/ton)         International Oil Price&#13;
15%                $ 7.0                   5.8%&#13;
20%                $ 8.3                   6.9%&#13;
25%                $ 9.5                   7.9%&#13;
Given the well head price, Uzemnunaigas, in principle, would need to purchase about one option&#13;
(to sell a ton of oil at the assumed exercise average price) for every two tons of sales to hedge&#13;
against a decline in its projected revenue for the illustrated year.&#13;
1. Both the convenience yield and the volatility of crude oil prices are subject to changes over any given period;&#13;
for simplicity, they are assumed to be constant in the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
160                                                                          Annex 7.7&#13;
8.    Given the cost of hedging derived above, a strategy of hedging may well be worthwhile&#13;
for any given year even though the likelihood of a negative NPV over the project period as a&#13;
whole is relatively low. The conditions under which this form (and other possibly available&#13;
form) of protection against adverse price and revenue exposures are feasible, cost-effective and&#13;
beneficial to Uzenmunaigas will be addressed under the financial management assistance&#13;
component of the proposed project.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
UZEN OIL FIELD REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 8.3&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
The following assumptions are the basis for the projections used in the financial evaluations in&#13;
Chapter 5 and Chapter 8. The assumptions are consistent with those used for the economic&#13;
analysis (Chapter 7).&#13;
1.    Monetary Unit: US Dollars.&#13;
2.    Exchange Rate: All investments are denominated in US dollars. Historic operating costs&#13;
and monetary working capital items denominated in tenge have been converted at the average&#13;
US$:Tenge exchange rates for the relevant period. Other balance sheet items and liabilities have&#13;
been translated at end of period US$:Tenge rate. All projections are on the basis of a nominal&#13;
exchange rate of US$1 = Tenge 63.&#13;
3.    Inflation Indices: Cost estimates are based on 1995 prices. Prices of imported and&#13;
importable goods and services purchased by Uzenmunaigas are escalated at the Bank's muv&#13;
index; the cost of international non-tradeable local goods and services are escalated at an average&#13;
annual rate of 15% over the project implementation period. The projections are in constant&#13;
(2000) US dollars.&#13;
4.    Oil Production: The bases for the production profiles, with and without the project, are&#13;
elaborated in the economic evaluation (Chapter 7) and in the analysis of the rehabilitation&#13;
program (Chapter 5). The wells workover profiles and the production profiles for the full&#13;
rehabilitation of the field and for the project are shown explicitly in Annexes 5.1.&#13;
5.    Oil Prices: The bases for the oil prices used in the economic and financial analysis are&#13;
detailed in the economic evaluation (Chapter 5) and in the supporting annexes. No price&#13;
escalation is applied to the oil prices. Export prices to the CIS include VAT; all other prices are&#13;
net of VAT (see tax assumptions below).&#13;
6.    Operating Inputs: Electricity requirements are based on the calculated power requirements&#13;
of: (i) pumping producer wells; (ii) water injections pumps; (iii) pumping and process&#13;
requirements for the proposed new fluid processing facilities; (iv) historic electricity requirements&#13;
per unit fluid processed; and (v) an allowance for general electricity use based on historic ratios&#13;
(in the case of the projections of the performance of the field as a whole. The cost of power is&#13;
projected at US$0.04 cents (excluding VAT) per kilowatt-hr in the base year.&#13;
7.    Water: Water requirements for flooding are a non-incremental cost; the cost of water is&#13;
estimated at US$0.07 (excluding VAT) per 1000 cubic meters in the base year based on the&#13;
estimated annual equivalent cost of replacement of the existing water line; water requirements for&#13;
the field are assumed at 2x fluid production levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8.3                                                                       171&#13;
8.    Chemicals: The following chemical usage rates and prices are assumed in the case of the&#13;
project and for rehabilitation of the field as a whole:&#13;
Water Treatment Chemicals&#13;
Scale Inhibitor:   1 bbl/100,00 water ( US$800/bbl&#13;
Corrosion Inhibitor: 1 bbl/I00,000 water @ US$1 100/bbl&#13;
Oxygen Scavanger:  I bbl/100,000 water @ US$1300/bbl&#13;
Biocide:           1 bbl/100,000 water @ US$1800/bbl&#13;
Oil Production Chemicals&#13;
Corrosion Inhibitor: 1 bbl/I00,000 fluid @ US$1 100/bbl&#13;
Scale Inhibitor:   1 bbl/100,000 fluid @ US$800/bbl&#13;
De-Emulsifier:     1 bbl/100,000 fluid @ US$800/bbl&#13;
Wax Suppressant:   4 bbl/100,000 fluid @ US$800/bbl&#13;
In the without project case, only de-emulsifiers are used at the historic rate per unit fluid&#13;
production.&#13;
9.    Rehabilitation Workovers:  Rehabilitation workovers in all financial projections are&#13;
expensed as incurred. Rehabilitation workovers are projected to take 6 days per well to perform&#13;
at a base cost (including logging and completion services, workovers rigs services and materials&#13;
and parts) of US$138,000 per producer well.&#13;
10.   Routine Services: The need for routine services in the without project case is assumed&#13;
to follow the historic rate of two (six monthly) services per active producing well per annum.&#13;
Services are estimated to require 4.5 days per well at a cost of US$2,600 per well. With the&#13;
project and with full field rehabilitation, the need for services is projected to decline to once per&#13;
year per active producing well.&#13;
Routine workovers are assumed not to be performed in the without project or the without-&#13;
full field rehabilitation case. In the project case, routine workovers are performed on a five-year&#13;
cycle at a projected base cost of US$32,400 per well.&#13;
Labor requirements are not considered incremental. Labor costs in the with-field and&#13;
without-field-rehabilitation are based on the current estimated payroll costs for the oil producing&#13;
operations.&#13;
11.   Transport Losses &amp; Owvn Use: These are based on the recent historic rate of 7% of oil&#13;
transported by pipeline.&#13;
12.   Oil Sales: Oil sales are based on production, net of an inventory requirement of 5% of&#13;
production, and less transport losses and own-use.&#13;
The distribution of sales for the financial evaluation of the project is based on the&#13;
composition of sales in the economic evaluation. The basis for the assignment of sales is&#13;
elaborated in the economic evaluation (Chapter 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
172                                                                           Annex 8.3&#13;
For the analysis of the rehabilitation program for the field as a whole, inventory&#13;
requirements and losses are as above. Prices are also as at above. The distribution of sales in&#13;
the analysis of the rehabilitation program is based on the assumption that, in the case of the&#13;
rehabilitation of the field, sales to Atyrau refinery are equal to the sales levels without&#13;
rehabilitation and the balance of sales is distributed on a 50/50 basis between CIS sales and swaps&#13;
with Russian producers. In the without-full field rehabilitation case, 40% of sales are assigned&#13;
to the Atyrau refinery in line with current market shares.&#13;
13.   Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable are assumed to be equal to 40 days of annual&#13;
sales in all financial projections.&#13;
14.   Accounts Payable: Accounts payable are assumed to be equal to 30 days of annual&#13;
operating expenses (excluding rehabilitation expenses and, where applicable, labor costs) in all&#13;
financial projections.&#13;
15.   Loan Interest: For purposes of the projections, interest on the on-lent amount is assumed&#13;
to be at a Bank loan rate of 6.98% plus a margin of 2%. The on-lending maturity is 12 years,&#13;
including a grace period of four (4) years.&#13;
No adjustment is made in the debt-service computations for possible gearing effects -- the&#13;
relative impact of inflation on the value of debt relative to its impact on the cash generation of&#13;
the project.&#13;
In the financial projections for the rehabilitation of the field as a whole, it is assumed that&#13;
all investments are financed with equity.&#13;
16.   Tax Assumptions: The tax assumptions are as follows:&#13;
Geological Levy: It is assumed that Uzenmunaigas' oil operations are subject to the&#13;
geological levy (8% of revenues) and that the application of a future royalty regime to replace&#13;
this levy is at a comparable average rate. Currently, the average royalty rates applicable to&#13;
negotiated agreements for oil investments with similar incremental production as in the project&#13;
are, in general, substantially lower than the rate applied under the levy.&#13;
Rental Payments: Uzenneft was exempt from rental payments from the inception of the&#13;
tax to 1993. It was subject to the tax in 1994 at a rate of 2% of oil revenues. However, for the&#13;
financial evaluation, no additional (excess) profit taxes (including rental payments) are assumed&#13;
to be applied on the project's incremental contributions to Uzenmunaigas' profits.&#13;
Value-Added Tax: The prevailing standard rate of VAT is 20%. No VAT is applied&#13;
against oil sales through Atyrau refinery since the transaction is structured as a sale of oil and&#13;
purchase of petroleum products with offsetting VAT liabilities for both the refinery and&#13;
Uzenmunaigas. It is assumed that swap transactions with Russian oil producers are structured&#13;
in a similarly offsetting basis. VAT on inputs are fully creditable against VAT on CIS sales.&#13;
However, excess credit of VAT on operating inputs are assumed not to be credited against the&#13;
VAT liability on oil sales outside the project, carried forward or reimbursed.  This is a&#13;
conservative treatment.  For capital expenditures (excluding expended project investment&#13;
expenditures), it is assumed that no net VAT liability a.-.ses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8.3                                                                            173&#13;
Depreciation Tax Shields: Although the depreciation schedules specified in the General&#13;
Tax Code imply applicable tax depreciation lives of between eight and ten years for classes of&#13;
fixed assets to be procured under the project, a shorter life of five years is used in the analysis.&#13;
This reflects the thrust of the underlying analytical work for petroleum tax reform in Kazakstan&#13;
that the applicable tax depreciation rules for petroleum operations may need to be adjusted to&#13;
provide a more competitive incentive for oil investments.&#13;
Tax Accounting: Specific tax accounting rules for oil operations are expected to be&#13;
detailed in the petroleum tax code. For purposes of the financial analysis, all workover costs are&#13;
expended in the year in which they are incurred. It is assumed that in the computation of&#13;
incremental taxable income, incremental losses or profits attributable to the project are not offset&#13;
by profits or losses from other Uzenmunaigas activities.&#13;

            Kazakstan - Uzen Oil Field Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Uzen Oil
            Field Rehabilitation Project are to: 1) help reduce the rate
            of decline in oil production and generate resources for
            reinvestment in the Uzen field's operations; 2) promote
            the reorganization of Uzenmunaigas into commercially viable
            corporate units and its/their privatization; 3) assist
            Uzenmunaigas in assessing the impact of past operating
            practices on the present condition of the reservoirs, wells
            and the environment of the field; 4) contribute to the
            remediation of past environmental damage to the field and to
            the strengthening of Uzenmunaigas' environmental
            monitoring and management systems and capacity; and 5) train
            Uzenmunaigas' staff in modern oil field operating
            practices and strengthen the organization's capacity to
            manage the implementation of the rehabilitation program and
            oil field operations. The project consists of the following
            components: 1) physical investments including subsurface
            rehabilitation (provision of equipment, spare parts and
            chemicals), surface facilities rehabilitation and
            environmental protection and remediation; 2) physical
            investment implementation support comprising well testing
            and logging services, contract workover services and
            consulting services; and 3) organizational development
            support involving the strengthening of Uzenmunaigas
            management through improvements in its financial and
            operating information systems and the improvement of its
            financial management and accounting practices and systems.
