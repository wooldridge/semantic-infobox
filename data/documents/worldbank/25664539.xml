(3) Participating countries, and&#13;
(4) Global partners.&#13;
1. Steering Committee&#13;
The GPSA Steering Committee (SC) will initially have 10 members: compromising of the&#13;
following:&#13;
* Three donor agencies (two government bilateral agencies and one private&#13;
foundation/donor);&#13;
* Three CSOs (one from a "part-I" country and two from "part-II" countries); and&#13;
* Three representatives from developing country governments.&#13;
The Vice-President of WBI will serve as the SC chair. In addition, the Program Manager&#13;
of the Secretariat will join the SC in an observer capacity to serve as a resource person and&#13;
to facilitate timely implementation and follow-up of SC decisions. To balance continuity&#13;
with rotated membership, participation in the SC will be on the basis of fixed three-year&#13;
terms, which will be staggered after the first three-year period. The SC may expand its&#13;
representation provided it maintains a numerical balance of members from all three groups.&#13;
Steering' Committee Roles and Responsibilities:&#13;

reflected in the annual call for-proposals&#13;

(RoE)&#13;
&gt; Contribute to the development and implementation of a GPSA resource&#13;
mobilization strategy&#13;
Decisions by the SC will be made by consensus. SC formal (face-to-face) sessions require&#13;
a quorum of at least six people. Decisions may be made through electronic means between&#13;
face-to-face meetings on a no-objection basis involving all members of the SC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-&#13;
The SC will meet in person twice a year or more often if necessary. SC meeting locations&#13;
and dates will be proposed by the Secretariat and agreed by the SC.&#13;
2. GPSA Secretariat&#13;
A Secretariat housed in the World Bank has the responsibility to manage the funding,&#13;
networking, communications, reporting and administrative tasks of the GPSA as well as&#13;
the overall management of the GPSA, including coordination, administration and grant-&#13;
making functions:&#13;
Grant-making functions include: (a) Manage the overall grant application and selection&#13;
process, and coordinate the supervision of grant projects with the Bank's Country&#13;
Management Units and with task team leaders (TTLs) appointed as project supervisors, (b)&#13;

country's priorities; (c) Prepare ToRs and select the Roster of Experts and coordinate the&#13;
grants' overall review process; (d) Recommend proposals after their review by the Roster&#13;
of Experts and submit them to the SC for approval on a non-objection basis; (e) Set up and&#13;
manage a GPSA Help Desk for grantees; (f) Work with potential grantees in the&#13;
introduction of changes to their proposals, based on the feedback provided by experts,&#13;
government officials, the public and the findings of the Bank fiduciary assessment of each&#13;
individual proposal.&#13;

in order to bring expert advice into the selection of proposals. The RoE will consist&#13;
of a list of individuals with strong knowledge of social accountability approaches&#13;
and a sound understanding of the realities of the participating countries.&#13;
*  All grants shall be made subject to the decision of the Secretariat to submit,&#13;
along with any peer review comments, for no objection by the GPSA Steering&#13;
Committee, and review and clearance by the relevant Director or Regional Vice&#13;
President in accordance with the Bank's relevant policies and procedures.&#13;
3. Participating countries&#13;
The GPSA will operate in countries whose governments have "opted-in" to the program,&#13;
and World Bank Country Directors will consult with their respective governments and will&#13;
submit an "Opt-In" letter of consent signed by the government to the GPSA Secretariat.&#13;
Governments will be provided each grant proposal for their review for a period of 10-&#13;
