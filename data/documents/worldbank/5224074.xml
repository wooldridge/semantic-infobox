&#13;
                       I. Background&#13;
&#13;
 1.      The objective o fthe Project i s to establish an enablingenvironment for private&#13;
 sector-led economic growth and poverty reduction within the Borrower's territory&#13;
&#13;
2.       The project focuses on promoting a competitive climate by (i)    streamliningthe&#13;
business environment; (ii)   reducing costs and increasing the efficiency o f&#13;
telecommunications, water and electricity utilities, and the tea industry; and (iii)&#13;
 improving access to financial and support services to local entrepreneurs.&#13;
&#13;
 3.      The project, built on the achievement o fthe closedRwanda Private Sector&#13;
DevelopmentProject (Cr.245 1-RW),i s designed as a response o f the Bank Group to the&#13;
request o f the client for creating abetter climate for private sector development in&#13;
Rwanda. The project is a packaged response aimed at stimulating the demand side by&#13;
enhancing investment promotionwith FIAS and MIGA andhelpingestablish conditions&#13;
with the SME Group to provide financial and non- financial services to emerging or&#13;
existing SMEs. Further, to respondto this demand, IDA i s working on reducing&#13;
immediate threats to the financial sector and capacity improvement, while IFC will&#13;
addressthe issue o f long-termresources and capital adequacy when conditions permit.&#13;
IDAis also helpingto improve the legal environment and stimulate efficiency inutilities&#13;
and tea sectors by loweringcosts through privatization.&#13;
&#13;
                      11.     RecentEconomicDevelopments&#13;
&#13;
4.      Between August and October 2003, an elected government, chosen through&#13;
presidential and parliamentary elections, replaced the transitional govemment established&#13;
immediately after the 1994 genocide. The new government reiterated its commitment to&#13;
national reconciliation, economic reforms, and poverty reduction. Donors continue to&#13;
provide generous financial and technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
5.      In2002, performance under the first annual (Poverty ReductionGrowth Facility)&#13;
PRGF review was satisfactory. For the period 2000-02, the growth rate averaged 7.4&#13;
percent with low and stable inflation, making Rwanda one o f the best performers in Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa. Revenue performance reached a level o f 13.4% in 2003, up from, 12.2&#13;
percent o f GDP in 2002, 11.4% in 2001, (and 9.7 percent in 2000). Social spending&#13;
increased gradually to 6.3% o f GDP in 2003 (compared to 6.1 percent in 2002, 5.3&#13;
percent in 2001, and 4 percent in 2000). In addition, to enhance public sector&#13;
productivity, the Government embarked on reforms in public expenditure and financial&#13;
management, and related public institutions. In 2003, external shocks to production and&#13;
prices hampered economic growth. GDP growth was estimated to be below 3%, with&#13;
inflation at 7.7%, compared to 9.4 percent GDP growth and 2 percent inflation in 2002.&#13;
The reductioninthe level o f growth was mainly due to drought conditions duringthe late&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 2002 and early 2003 period. While agriculture production dropped slightly, construction&#13;
 grew by about 15 percent (construction accounts for about 10percent o fthe economy).&#13;
&#13;
 6.      In addition to the drought conditions and poor economic growth, in 2003, there&#13;
 were also unforeseen expenditures which exacerbated the fiscal situation. For the first&#13;
 time since the genocide, Rwanda held presidential and parliamentary elections. These&#13;
 elections, which are important for establishing a more stable political framework, cost&#13;
 more money than expected or programmed in the budget. An attempt to raise funds from&#13;
 the population resulted intotal donations o f $2 million, which was not sufficient to cover&#13;
 the cost o f the elections. In addition, programmed donor grants, which were expected to&#13;
 be disbursed inearly 2003, didnot materialize. As a result, public finances were less than&#13;
 expected, despite the fact that revenue collections were on target. Domestic net credit to&#13;
 the government increased to finance the additional expenditures and shortfalls in donor&#13;
 grants, leading to an overall deficit (excluding grants) o f 10.5% o f GDP in2003.&#13;
&#13;
 7.      The above factors exacerbate the vulnerability o f the extemal accounts to extemal&#13;
 shocks, and this vulnerability i s compounded by the heavy reliance on a few commodities&#13;
 for exports. At present, the current account deficit is estimated to be around 19.8 percent&#13;
o f GDP (compared to the programmed level for 2003 o f 18.7 percent, and which is&#13;
programmed to increase to roughly 21 percent in2004). Rwanda continues to rely heavily&#13;
on coffee and tea, which consist o f about 60 percent o f total exports. Coffee production&#13;
and exports fell in2003 due to a combination o f low international coffee prices, drought&#13;
conditions, and older plants. Tea production, which accounts for the largest foreign&#13;
exchange eamings (estimated at US$22 million), declined slightly in 2003 due to the&#13;
drought. These events led to a US$4 million drop inmerchandise exports, which resulted&#13;
inUS$63 millionofexports, in2003.&#13;
&#13;
8.      The above events, coupled with construction related bank lending, led to a faster&#13;
than programmed expansion in the monetary aggregates and rapid exchange rate&#13;
depreciation. Through end-September 2003, some targets under the Intemational&#13;
Monetary Fund (IMF) PRGF-supported program were not observed. The Government&#13;
has been aware o f these difficulties, and has reached an agreement on revised targets and&#13;
has asked for waivers in order to continue with the program. Presently, the GoR is&#13;
working with the Bank, (in the context o f the upcoming PRSC), to ensure deepening o f&#13;
and continued progress in structural reforms to support sustained economic growth,&#13;
revenue generation and debt sustainability. The GoR does not expect any further&#13;
deterioration in fiscal and monetary aggregates, (provided donor money comes as&#13;
programmed in the budget). In order to manage the risk to the budget associated with&#13;
uncertainty in donor disbursement, the government has identified and agreed on&#13;
contingent levels o f spending, under the PRGF program, and will continue to seek&#13;
increased grant financing.&#13;
&#13;
9.      The Rwandan private sector is small and weak, as years o f conflict and socio-&#13;
political mismanagement have driven away private investments. The financial sector is&#13;
small, burdened with non-performing loans and lacks opportunities for good loans and&#13;
other investments. Reforms have been initiated to strengthen the financial sector. It was&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in that context that the Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project, aimed at&#13;
establishing an enabling environment for growth and development o f the private sector in&#13;
Rwanda, was developed and included a component dedicated to increase financial access&#13;
through a quasi equity and loan venture capital fund to strengthen the middle and small&#13;
enterprises in Rwanda.&#13;
&#13;
                      111.    Start Up Fund&#13;
&#13;
 10.    The Government of Rwanda, has developed an innovative strategy to provide risk&#13;
capital financing, complemented by intensive business assistance, to a significant number&#13;
o f Rwanda's most promising small and medium enterprises. Operations are expected to&#13;
begin in September 2004. The design o f the Rwandan Enterprise Investment Company&#13;
(the "REIC") has three principal parts:&#13;
&#13;
 11.    Leveraged capitalization strategy. In order to attract equity Investors into the&#13;
Rwandan Enterprise Investment Company (REIC) , the Rwandan Ministry o f Finance&#13;
and Economic Planning (Minecofin) is offering to provide the REIC with a 10-year loan&#13;
of the Rwanda franc equivalent o f U S D 4 million, at 2% interest (in Rwandan francs),&#13;
with a five-year grace period on principal payments. The purpose of the Minecofin Loan&#13;
is first to increase the amount o f money available for the REIC to invest and second,&#13;
given the potential leveraging effect o f the Minecofin Loan, to provide a strong incentive&#13;
to the Investors and to the REIC's management team to operate the REIC on a profitable&#13;
basis by investing inhigh-performance SMEs.&#13;
&#13;
12.     It is important to note that the REIC will operate as a private Rwandan entity,&#13;
owned entirely by its equity Investors, and that the managers o f the REIC will be selected&#13;
and engaged by the Investors. Investment decisions will be made exclusively by&#13;
representatives of the Investors. The GoR wishes only to retain the rights o f a lender to&#13;
receive timely payments of interest and principal and to ensure compliance with the&#13;
agreed investment policy of the REIC. While this investment policy has been defined in&#13;
detail by the designers o f the REIC, in essence, it simply calls for the REIC to invest in&#13;
SMEs of those size and sector characteristics which will provide maximum benefits to&#13;
the growthand diversification o f the Rwandanprivate sector.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Innovative investment strategy. Inaddition to the investment policy imposed on&#13;
the REIC by the terms o f the Minecofin Loan, the REIC will also be required to operate&#13;
according to a prescribed investment methodology. This particular methodology has been&#13;
determined through global research into best practices in S M E risk capital finance. It is&#13;
designed to take greater risk than would a commercial bank, while taking less risk than&#13;
would a conventional venture capital fund. Its objective is to provide commercial&#13;
financing to SMEs which, o n the one hand, cannot offer sufficient collateral to obtain&#13;
adequate bank financing and, on the other hand, cannot provide realistic prospects for&#13;
"venture capital" type exits from equity through third-party sales o f shares.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 14.      More specifically, the investment strategy o f the REIC calls for the combining of&#13;
 a relatively small investment in the equity o f the Investee with a substantially larger&#13;
 shareholder loan. This shareholder loan will carry a low interest rate with additional&#13;
 rights to a small percentage of the gross sales o f the Investee. The benefit o f this&#13;
 "royalty"-based strategy i s to provide growth-orientedfinancing at a cost which i s tied to&#13;
 the performance ofthe Investee. The purpose of limitingthe REIC's exposure inequity in&#13;
 each investment is to allow for repurchase o f the REIC's shares in the Investee at a price&#13;
 which i s realistically affordable to the Investee at the agreed time o f exit. It i s important&#13;
 to recognize that while this quasi-equity strategy clearly constitutes risk capital finance, it&#13;
 i s designed more to avoid the conventional practices o f venture capital than to imitate&#13;
 them&#13;
&#13;
 15.      Dedicated technical assistance facility. Inan effort to ensurethat each Investee&#13;
 reaches its full economic potential, a grant-based pool o f funds outside the accounts o f&#13;
 the REIC is beingraised to provide for additionaltechnical andbusiness assistance. This&#13;
 T A Facility will be usedto fund third-party assistance andconsultancies on a demand-&#13;
 drivenbasis. Thenature o feachinterventionwill be defined collaborativelybythe&#13;
 Investees and the managers o f the REIC. Examples o fthe TA Facility's use include&#13;
 assistance inaccounting and informationsystems, development o f marketingstrategies&#13;
 and materials, sourcing o f appropriate technology andraw materials, and training o f&#13;
management and workers.&#13;
&#13;
                       IV.     Conditions for Tranche Release&#13;
&#13;
 16.     As stated in Part A.6 of Schedule 1of the DCA, the release of S M E tranche is&#13;
subject to the following conditions:&#13;
&#13;
     (a) the macro-economic policy framework o f the Borrower is satisfactory, as&#13;
         measured on the basis o f indicators agreed between the Borrower and the&#13;
         Association;&#13;
&#13;
     (b) the Borrower has achieved progress satisfactory to the Association incarrying out&#13;
         the Program;&#13;
&#13;
     (c) that with respect to Categories 3(b)(i) and 3(b)(ii), the Borrower has provided&#13;
         evidence satisfactory in form and in substance to the Association that the start up&#13;
         fund (Rwanda Small Loan Fund and Rwanda Risk Capital Fund) for SMEs has&#13;
         been established underterms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
                       V.      Meeting Conditions for Tranche Release&#13;
&#13;
17.      'The macro-economic policy framework of the Borrower. As measured using&#13;
indicators agreed between the Borrower and the Association, i s satisfactory to IDA. The&#13;
finding o f compliance is based on IDA review o f the agreed upon indicators o f&#13;
performance, as reflected in the recent Joint Staff Assessment o f the Poverty Reduction&#13;
Strategy Paper approved by the Bank's Board on June 8, 2004. Such findings were&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
confirmed by IMF staff review o f the macroeconomic situation in mid-2004 carried out&#13;
in July 2004 and the IMF Board approval on July 24, 2004                o f a 3-year PRGF&#13;
arrangement.&#13;
&#13;
18.     Program Implementation. Overall, the project implementation is rated highly&#13;
satisfactory and all the project activities are being carried out in accordance with the&#13;
agreed work plan matrix. The disbursement to date i s SDR 11.1 million (US$15.5&#13;
million) representing 35% of the credit proceed. It is most likely that end o f year target o f&#13;
US$9.4 million could be reached with the release o f SME tranche. The project continues&#13;
to perform satisfactorily and i s in compliance with the Bank's procurement and financial&#13;
procedures while meeting its coordination challenges o f the project activities&#13;
implemented by twelve various agencies. Regular quarterly project implementation&#13;
reports, including an update on the project annual work plan, are sent to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
19.     After 3.5 years o f project implementation, the Borrower has achieved progress&#13;
satisfactory to IDAinimplementing the program, evident by the following actions:&#13;
&#13;
    (i) undertheprivatizationcomponent:&#13;
                ELECTROGAZ has been under management contract since October 2003.&#13;

                the tea factory will take place inNovember 2004. The second tea factory,&#13;
                Mulindi, will be offered for sale again as the offered prices were too low&#13;
                and Government had to reject the bids after all efforts to increase the sale&#13;
               price upwards failed.&#13;

            Rwanda : Competitiveness and Enterprise
            Development Project - Release of second tranche : full compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Competitiveness and
            Enterprise Development Project is to establish an enabling
            environment for private sector-led economic growth and
            poverty reduction within Rwanda.    Recent economic
            developments include the election of a new government;
            satisfactory performance under the first annual Poverty
            Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) review; exacerbation of the
            country's fiscal situation and external account
            vulnerability; and expansion in the monetary aggregates and
            rapid exchange rate depreciation. The conditions for the
            release of SME tranche have been met by: satisfactory
            macro-economic policy framework of the Borrower; highly
            satisfactory project implementation ratings; and progress
            under the privatization component, business and legal
            environment improvement component, and private sector
            development component.  IDA has informed the Borrower of the
            availability of the SME tranche in the amount of SDR
            3,890,000 to strengthen growth in the SME sector of Rwanda.
