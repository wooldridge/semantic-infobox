CapaCity development in the world bank group: a review&#13;
of nonlending approaChes&#13;
by nansia Constantinou, world bank institute&#13;
&#13;
    The World Bank Group has consistently spent considerable sums and emphasized the importance of&#13;
    capacity development to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Capacity development is&#13;
    included as a development objective of two-thirds of the Bank's lending operations and is increasingly a&#13;
    focus of the Bank's country assistance strategies. But it is often in the Bank's nonlending work--which is&#13;
    spread across the institution--where much innovation and experimentation take place. This nonlending&#13;
    business draws both on the Bank's own budget as well as on donor trust funds, Bank-wide grant instru-&#13;
    ments, and other funding mechanisms. The business models guiding this work are diverse and evolving,&#13;
    and some may point the way to successful practices that could be used elsewhere. This brief focuses on&#13;
    capacity development approaches in the growing area of nonlending programs. It discusses differences in&#13;
    these approaches in terms of design, instruments, delivery mechanisms and funding, and highlights an&#13;
    often overlooked, but large and growing part of the Bank's overall work.&#13;
&#13;

  The World Bank Group supports capacity development        ties to external clients. The World Bank Treasury assists&#13;
in almost all of its work. But although capacity develop-   member central banks in developing the expertise neces-&#13;

  an example from ifC: Combining investment with advisory services&#13;
    An example of how the two arms of IFC--investment and advisory services--can enhance each other's contribution is the case of&#13;
  the privatized Algerian fertilizer company Fertial. The new owners and the government of Algeria agreed that Fertial would commit&#13;
  to developing products for the local market in support of the agricultural sector. The company approached IFC's PEP facility in Cairo&#13;
  to help them create training centers for farmers and government workers to learn how to improve their use of fertilizer. As a first&#13;
  step, IFC investment and advisory service units arranged for joint meetings, provided investment training for technical assistance&#13;
  staffers, and organized combined appraisal trips. Through joint discussions with Fertial, the two IFC groups worked together to&#13;
  make sure the investment would be well spent to maximize the development impact.&#13;

 gram. With WBI support, the bank created a policy analysis unit within its research department to provide guidance to the bank on&#13;
 emerging policy issues and advise the Bangladesh government on economic and fiscal policy. The Bank also produces several pub-&#13;
 lic policy papers, such as financial sector reviews and monetary policy reviews, which have been seen as indicating the growing&#13;
 policy influence of the central bank. From the beginning of the program, WBI focused on building local ownership for reforming&#13;
 work processes and incentives: annual work plans were outlined and budgets and product lines were clearly defined. WBI follows&#13;
 up and supervises the development of the unit and provides customized input on specific areas of demand. It also provides a plat-&#13;
 form for knowledge exchange by bringing in national, regional, and international expertise and experience.&#13;

 about world bank institute (wbi): Unleashing the Power of Knowledge to Enable a World Free of Poverty&#13;
 The World Bank Institute (WBI) helps countries share and apply global and local knowledge to meet development chal-&#13;
 lenges. WBI's capacity development programs are designed to build skills among groups of individuals involved in per-&#13;
 forming tasks, and also to strengthen the organizations in which they work, and the sociopolitical environment in which&#13;
 they operate.&#13;

            Capacity development in the World Bank
            Group : a review of nonlending approaches
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This work on a review of non-lending
            approaches, which for the purposes of this brief is defined
            broadly as activities that have a stated goal of improving
            individual, organizational and broader institutional
            capacities in a country, is spread widely throughout the
            Bank. It includes specific, well-defined Bank products, such
            as non-lending technical assistance, training, some economic
            and sector work, as well as some research and other
            knowledge-sharing activities that the Bank facilitates for
            its partner countries. World Bank units directly carry out
            much of this work.
