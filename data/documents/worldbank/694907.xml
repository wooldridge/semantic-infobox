THE STATE OF ERITREA&#13;
ROAD SECTOR ENGINEERING PROJECT&#13;
SECTION A&#13;
Project Description&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Eritrea became formally independent in 1993, after 3 decades of war, and became&#13;
a member of the Bank Group in July 1994. Eritrea inherited a shattered economy, an&#13;
infrastructure damaged by the war and inadequate maintenance, a neglected social sector,&#13;
large numbers of refugees, and limited institutional capacity. This project has been&#13;
formulated by the Government of the State of Eritrea (GOE) to address some of the key&#13;
issues by establishing the basis for improving essential national infrastructure links, and&#13;
building institutional capacity in the road sector.&#13;
2.    The road network in Eritrea is limited with approximately 1,400 km of main road&#13;
and 4,500 km of rural/feeder roads. 622 km of the network are paved and, in total, less&#13;
than 1000 km can be considered as providing all-weather access. The main road network&#13;
was mainly constructed during the mid-1930's to geometric designs based upon very&#13;
limited traffic. The Government places high priority on improving the coverage and&#13;
quality of the network and, with the assistance of the European Union, is in the process of&#13;
rehabilitating and widening the main road between Asmara and the port of Massawa.&#13;
The improvement of the Nefasit - Dekemhare - Tera Imni road is expected to commence&#13;
in 1997.&#13;
Project Rationale and Objectives&#13;
3.    The overall goal of the Country Assistance Strategy (report # 15324-ER, February&#13;
1996) is poverty reduction, to be achieved through seven detailed programs: (i)&#13;
establishment of an enabling environment for private sector led growth and employment;&#13;
(ii) physical infrastructure strengthening to support private sector development and&#13;
market linkages, and to facilitate access to public services; (iii) rural development and&#13;
food security; (iv) human resource development (basic health and education programs,&#13;
and resettlement of refugees); (v) institutional capacity building; (vi) protection of the&#13;
environment; and (vii) macro-economic support.&#13;
4.    The project has been formulated to address several of these CAS objectives either&#13;
directly or indirectly. The project will establish the basis for major improvements in the&#13;
road network which will open up important areas in Western Eritrea to development and&#13;
settlement, improve market linkages and facilitate the provision of, and access to basic&#13;
social services. The project directly responds to the findings of the 1994 IDA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
Participatory Rural Assessment Study, which identified isolation and lack of road links as&#13;
substantial constraints to poverty alleviation. The project will also provide the&#13;
institutional capacity necessary to meet GOE' s commitment to encourage private sector&#13;
participation in the road sector program; a policy fully consistent with the Bank's&#13;
experience and advice. It will be several years, however, before the private sector can&#13;
assume responsibility for all roadwork and, until that time, some force account&#13;
construction and maintenance will be necessary to meet total demands in the sector. The&#13;
project will thus also assist RTCD to improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of its&#13;
own operations.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
5.    The proposed project consists of three components:&#13;
(a)   Feasibility study, environmental assessment and detailed design of the&#13;
Karen - Tessenei and Barentu - Mendefera roads to Western Eritrea;&#13;
(b)   National Bridge Inventory, Condition Survey and Strength Analysis of all&#13;
bridges not covered by (a), and the preparation of a prioritized remedial&#13;
program of bridgeworks;&#13;
(c)   Technical assistance and capacity building for RTCD to create a contract&#13;
administration capability, improve procurement and stores management,&#13;
and train mechanics, electricians, equipment operators and trainers.&#13;
(a)   Feasibility and Design Study: Karen - Tessenei and Barentu - Mendefera Roads&#13;
6.    A major improvement in the road links to Western Eritrea is essential to reduce&#13;
transport costs and provide the access and market linkages necessary for the development&#13;
of rain-fed agriculture and refugee settlement in the Gash Setit region which has major&#13;
agricultural potential. According to GOE statistics, over 70 percent of applications (over&#13;
100,000 ha.) for commercial land concessions have been made for the Gash Setit region,&#13;
and agricultural yields (according to FAO estimates) are almost 40 percent higher than&#13;
the national average. The improvement of this road is the Government's highest road&#13;
priority; when completed, an improved East-West road route will exist between Massawa&#13;
and the Sudan Border, providing not only a primary road axis for Eritrea but also some&#13;
potential as a regional transit route. The project proposes to fund the feasibility and&#13;
detailed design for both the rehabilitation of the existing Keren-Barentu-Tessenei road&#13;
(265 km) and the proposed upgrading of the Barentu-Mendefera part engineered road and&#13;
track (195 km). The two roads will form a network connecting Western Eritrea to the&#13;
rest of Eritrea.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
*  The Karen - Tessenei road is an existing narrow engineered road, primarily&#13;
gravel, which has deteriorated very severely; its Telford base is exposed over&#13;
much of its length.&#13;
*  Much of the proposed Barentu - Mendefera road is presently a track only&#13;
passable by four wheel-drive vehicles.&#13;
The feasibility study will assess the most economic program of road improvements,&#13;
including stage construction, to meet GOE's ultimate objective of a national road&#13;
network with 7m pavement and 1.5m shoulders. The environmental assessment will&#13;
assess the impact of road improvements on the affected areas and prepare a detailed&#13;
mitigation plan to minimize any direct or indirect effects. The feasibility study and&#13;
environmental assessment will be completed within four months.&#13;
7.    Following agreement on the findings of the feasibility study, the consultants will&#13;
prepare detailed designs, engineers' cost estimates, and the bidding documents necessary&#13;
for Intemational Competitive Bidding. Preparation of the detailed engineering design&#13;
and contract documents will take nine months. Prior to completion of the study, the&#13;
consultant will install all soils and materials testing equipment, procured under the study,&#13;
in a RTCD provided building, and will train RTCD personnel in its use. This facility will&#13;
then serve as the basis for RTCD's central laboratory.&#13;
8.    Vehicles and office equipment for the study will be provided by RTCD; the&#13;
Consultants will have to rent office accommodation. Training of RTCD personnel in the&#13;
use of materials' testing equipment will be undertaken through in-service training, by the&#13;
chief materials engineer.&#13;
(b)   National Bridge Inventory, Condition Survey, Strength Analysis and&#13;
Rehabilitation Program, and associated Capacity Building.&#13;
9.    Bridges are critical for transport access, and Eritrea's bridges have suffered&#13;
considerably during the last thirty years from both war and neglect. Several bridges were&#13;
destroyed and many more are thought to be in a critical condition. To safeguard road&#13;
access throughout Eritrea, it is essential that the structural integrity of the bridges is&#13;
guaranteed. The situation is aggravated by the lack of any records of the original&#13;
design/structural standards, poor construction techniques and inadequate materials. The&#13;
national bridge survey will cover all bridges, other than those included in the feasibility&#13;
and detailed design study, amounting to approximately 110 bridges. The study will:&#13;
establish a complete data base of the bridges including: inventory data, rated&#13;
condition of all bridge elements, and any associated road, drainage or river works;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
*  conduct physical non-destructive testing on all bridges showing signs of distress&#13;
and on a representative sample of other bridges (: 25 percent), sufficient to allow&#13;
detailed analysis of structural strength and load bearing capacity;&#13;
*  identify all bridges in need of repair, strengthening or replacement and prepare&#13;
detailed proposals for the necessary works;&#13;
*  develop and appraise a prioritized national bridge remedial program; and&#13;
*  train RTCD staff (two engineers and two technicians) in all aspects of the work&#13;
undertaken so that, by the end of the study, RTCD has the capability to undertake&#13;
similar work and analysis.&#13;
The national bridge inventory, condition survey, strength analysis and national bridge&#13;
works program is expected to take approximately twelve months and result in a&#13;
prioritized program of work which would allow, if necessary, GOE to seek external&#13;
assistance.&#13;
10.   Vehicles and basic office equipment will be provided to the Consultants by&#13;
RTCD. To help ensure constant interaction between the Consultants and RTCD staff,&#13;
office accommodation will be provided in the main RTCD complex in Asmara. The&#13;
training of the counterpart staff in bridge survey and structural strength analysis will be&#13;
undertaken through in-service training. Initially the counterparts will work together with&#13;
the consultants, but once the basic knowledge and skills have been transferred, the&#13;
counterparts will works as a survey team, under the overall supervision of the consultants.&#13;
(c)    Technical Assistance and Capacity Building&#13;
11.   Contract Administration: It is GOE policy that the construction and&#13;
maintenance of roads will be progressively contracted to the private sector, with RTCD&#13;
assuming a planning, management and supervision role. This policy can only be&#13;
implemented efficiently if RTCD has the capability to administer these construction and&#13;
maintenance contracts. This project component is designed to establish the basis for&#13;
contract administration within RTCD. The consultant will: (i) provide TA in contract&#13;
administration; (ii) develop standard contract documents and recommended contract&#13;
administration organization, systems and procedures; and (iii) train a minimum of two&#13;
RTCD engineers in contract administration, to create in-house capacity, and provide&#13;
seminars to other RTCD engineers and staff. The assignment will consist of an initial 18&#13;
month continuous period, followed by short-term interventions over the following twelve&#13;
months.&#13;
12.   Office accommodation and transport will be provided by RTCD, as well as office&#13;
equipment and computers for both the expert and the counterpart engineers. The creation&#13;
of in-house contract administration capacity will be developed through: (i) the provision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of standardized bidding and contract documents; (ii) the development of a contract&#13;
administration manual for RTCD; (iii) in-service training of RTCD counterparts; (iv)&#13;
supervised work experience; and (v) in-house seminars to counterparts and other RTCD&#13;
engineers. Counterparts will have early hands-on experience of contract administration&#13;
with the contracts to be financed by the European Union, in late 1997.&#13;
13.   Procurement and Spares Management: the present system of spares&#13;
procurement and management in RTCD results in inadequate identification of critical and&#13;
fast moving spares. As a consequence, repairs and overhauls are delayed, leading to the&#13;
grounding of equipment and poor equipment availability and reliability. To improve&#13;
systems within RTCD and ensure efficient procurement of spares, provide adequate&#13;
estimates for budgeting, and improve the monitoring and control of both spares and&#13;
equipment, RTCD requires the advice of a procurement/spare parts management expert.&#13;
The expert will undertake an initial twelve month assignment, to be followed by short-&#13;
term interventions over the following twelve months. A financial management expert is&#13;
also required for a short period (two months) to review overall financial management&#13;
systems within RTCD and ensure that systems recommended by the procurement adviser&#13;
will be compatible with improved financial management systems.&#13;
14.   The procurement specialist will work closely with the Chief Warehouse Manager;&#13;
office accommodation, office equipment and transport will be provided by RTCD.&#13;
Having developed new procurement and stores' management systems, the specialist will&#13;
train RTCD staff in their use through: (i) preparation of system manuals; (ii) in-service&#13;
training; and (iii) supervised work experience.&#13;
15.   Equipment Mechanic and Operator Training: the vocational institutes in&#13;
Eritrea produce basic mechanics without the specialist skills needed for the maintenance&#13;
of heavy equipment and plant. The project proposes to finance the training/upgrading of&#13;
RTCD mechanics, mainly through supervised on-the-job training. The basis of the&#13;
training will be the repair/rehabilitation of about 40 units of grounded heavy plant and&#13;
equipment over a 12 month period. Two master mechanics and an expert on electrical&#13;
systems will provide two 6 month courses to a total of about 32 mechanics. The project&#13;
will fund the trainers, training aides and specialized equipment as necessary, and spare&#13;
parts (approximately US$1.0 million). In addition, the project will provide for the&#13;
training of trainers (three mechanics, one electrician, and one equipment operator). The&#13;
overall duration of the mechanic training will be approximately 36 months, comprising an&#13;
initial period to survey the equipment and determine the requirement for spare parts&#13;
followed, after delivery of the spares, by the twelve month training period, and then&#13;
short-term interventions over the subsequent twelve months.&#13;
16.   RTCD will provide the necessary training facilities, office accommodation,&#13;
equipment and transport. Training of mechanics will be largely accomplished by&#13;
supervised work experience: groups of four mechanics will repair/rehabilitate items of&#13;
plant/equipment under the guidance and supervision of the external master&#13;
mechanics/electrician; each master mechanic will be responsible for two groups in each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
training course This supervised work experience will be supplemented by basic&#13;
classroom instruction, and selected specialist courses by equipment manufacturers.&#13;
17.   The training of a plant equipment operator trainer will be undertaken in Eritrea;&#13;
training of the mechanic trainers will be through sending selected mechanics on&#13;
appropriate overseas courses. The trainers will then be supervised, on their return, by the&#13;
external master mechanics on their follow-up visits.&#13;
18.   Training facility: a modest RTCD mechanic training facility will be constructed&#13;
as part of the project. It will comprise two classrooms and a small training workshop,&#13;
located within the main RTCD complex in Asmara. The construction cost of the facility&#13;
will be funded by GOE.&#13;
Environmental Issues&#13;
19.   This is considered a Category "C" project, with no enviromnental risks. The&#13;
Project comprises basically of studies, technical assistance and training; the only civil&#13;
works are the construction of 2 classrooms and a small workshop in the RTCD Asmara&#13;
complex. The road studies are likely to propose major new construction, with the&#13;
potential for adverse environmental impacts. To ensure that environment is taken fully&#13;
into account in the planning and design of these road improvements, a full environmental&#13;
impact assessment (to IDA's Category "A" standards) will be undertaken, prior to&#13;
detailed design. The environmental assessment will be undertaken in collaboration with&#13;
the Eritrea Environmental Agency which has agreed the Terms of Reference for the&#13;
assessment.&#13;
20.   There are no social, gender or resettlement issues associated with the project.&#13;
Lessons from Previous Bank Group Involvement&#13;
21.   The only completed Bank assisted project in Eritrea is the multi-donor Recovery&#13;
and Rehabilitation Project for Eritrea (RRPE), which included a roads component&#13;
consisting of: (i) the rehabilitation and upgrading of the Asmara - Massawa road,&#13;
financed by the European Union; and (ii) the construction of RTCD maintenance depots&#13;
at Karen and Barentu by IDA. The project was highly satisfactory in realizing the&#13;
implementation and development objectives, reflecting 'genuine government&#13;
commitment' to successful project implementation. The main lessons learnt from the&#13;
project were: (a) over-complexity - a simpler emergency project, with clearly defined&#13;
objectives and implementation procedures, would have been preferable; (b) a lack of&#13;
implementation indicators; and (c) the limited implementation management capacity,&#13;
which required the establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
22.   The design of the Road Sector Engineering Project (RSEP) has taken into account&#13;
the lessons of RRPE: very simple project; clearly defined objectives; clear delivery&#13;
mechanisms; and implementation indicators for each component. The components of&#13;
RSEP are basically free-standing and, given their modest size and complexity, do not&#13;
require a PMU. GOE will, however, appoint a suitably qualified project coordinator to&#13;
oversee overall implementation.&#13;
Critical Risks&#13;
23.   There is relatively little risk attached to the Roads and Bridge Studies. IDA&#13;
procurement procedures will help ensure that suitably qualified and competent&#13;
consultants are employed to undertake these basic technical studies. The risks are much&#13;
greater with respect to the technical assistance/skills' transfer components. The Project&#13;
includes a substantial component of technical assistance. This is necessary because&#13;
Eritrea has just emerged from a long period of civil war, and local capacity has to be&#13;
developed. TA projects in Africa have not been particularly successful, for a number of&#13;
reasons, the most important being:&#13;
(i)   insufficient Borrower ownership of, and commitment to the project;&#13;
(ii)  poor design of the technical assistance;&#13;
(iii) inadequate technical advisers; and&#13;
(iv)  unsuitable institutional/motivational environment.&#13;
There are risks attached to any TA project but they are assessed to be relatively modest in&#13;
this project, at least, in the short-term.&#13;
(i) Borrower Commitment and Ownership&#13;
24.   The management of RTCD is energetic and highly committed to the rehabilitation&#13;
of the country's roads and bridges, as shown by the very impressive volume of work that&#13;
has been achieved with very little foreign assistance. In addition to the widening and&#13;
rehabilitation of the Massawa - Asmara road, RTCD activities include:&#13;
Asmara - Keren: comprehensive program of pothole and edge repairs and the&#13;
re-alignment of about 9 km of road through mountainous terrain;&#13;
* Keren - Aderde (Barentu road): rehabilitation of the seriously deteriorated&#13;
paved road;&#13;
* Mendefera - Asmara: major widening and re-surfacing on mountainous&#13;
section;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
*  Mendefera - Barentu: improvement of existing tracks through the black cotton&#13;
soil areas, major earthworks to improve the track through the mountainous&#13;
area west of Maidama, construction of numerous culverts and two major&#13;
bridges; and&#13;
*  spot improvements to open the Massawa - Assab road to bus transport.&#13;
These works (not a comprehensive list) have been achieved with six professional&#13;
engineers and much of the supervision is undertaken by experienced sub-professionals&#13;
and foremen. This commitment is also apparent with respect to the maintenance of plant&#13;
and equipment. RTCD maintains its plant/equipment/heavy vehicle fleet of about 600&#13;
items with only 12 grade I and 20 grade II mechanics but reports average plant&#13;
availability at 60 - 70 percent.&#13;
25.   RTCD is committed and has demonstrated its capacity to perform substantial&#13;
work without TA, but it has also identified the need for additional skills to administer&#13;
contract construction and improve equipment maintenance. RTCD specifically requested&#13;
and defined the technical assistance components included in the project. It has developed&#13;
very tight terms of reference which give the highest priority to the goal of capacity&#13;
building. RTCD management will monitor the TA components very closely to ensure&#13;
that the objectives are fulfilled. RTCD recognizes that it has limited capacity to absorb&#13;
large numbers of consultants and has consequently planned to stagger the introduction of&#13;
consultants over a six-month period. The TA component will be introduced prior to the&#13;
bridge and road studies and the contract administration TA will be able to assist RTCD&#13;
with the administration of the subsequent contracts.&#13;
(ii)   Design of the technical assistance&#13;
26.   The TA component has been designed to incorporate best practices identified&#13;
from successful projects elsewhere. The Terms of Reference are clear and closely&#13;
focused, with considerable emphasis on the need for the transfer of skills. For each&#13;
component, there are clearly defined deliverable outputs. The evaluation framework for&#13;
consultant proposals places significant emphasis upon the proposed program for the&#13;
transfer of skills, and selected consultants will be expected in their Inception Reports to&#13;
outline monitorable benchmarks for skills' transfer. Toward the end of their initial&#13;
assignments, the experts will be expected to develop clear exit strategies to hand over&#13;
responsibilities to their counterparts, and the sustainability of the components will be&#13;
enhanced by periodic follow-up visits.&#13;
(iii)  Adequacy of technical advisers&#13;
27.   RTCD places very high priority on the transfer of skills to its staff. The quality&#13;
and experience of experts will form a very substantial part of the evaluation of TA&#13;
proposals, especially previous, and successful experience in skill transfer programs. Even&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
if qualified personnel are recruited, there is still the possibility that skills' transfer may not&#13;
take place. The causes can be various: the expert is not suited to the environment, the&#13;
counterpart is inadequately qualified or motivated, or the institutional framework is&#13;
inimical. To provide an early warning of potential problems, as well as to monitor the&#13;
progress of the skills' transfer, there will be regular confidential assessments, to RTCD&#13;
management, of the advisers by the counterparts, and vice versa.&#13;
(iv)   Institutional/motivational environment&#13;
28.   At present there is great commitment within RTCD, a legacy of the struggle for&#13;
independence. Salaries and wages may eventually, however, become the main&#13;
motivational factor. The most immediate problem, perhaps, is with respect to the trained&#13;
trainers. Trainers, compared to mechanics and plant operators, are often not eligible for&#13;
out-station and other operational allowances and, consequently, receive lower total&#13;
remuneration. RTCD recognizes the problem and has undertaken, as a covenant of the&#13;
Project, to recognize trainers specifically within its salary structure to ensure that&#13;
motivation is retained.&#13;
29.   There is, however, a much more general problem of salary scales in the medium&#13;
term. With the development of the private sector in Eritrea, GOE's policy of contracting&#13;
out roadwork, the likelihood of substantial investments in the road sector within Eritrea,&#13;
and a massive road development program planned in neighboring Ethiopia, the skills&#13;
provided under the project, engineering and equipment maintenance, will be in very high&#13;
demand in the region. Salaries and wages in the private sector are likely to rise very&#13;
substantially, and there is the very real possibility that trained personnel will be attracted&#13;
away from RTCD and possibly also away from Eritrea. The longer term sustainability of&#13;
the project is thus at risk.&#13;
30.   RTCD recognizes the problem, and the need to maintain salary scales at a level&#13;
which will attract and retain key staff. Given GOE's policy of shifting responsibility for&#13;
the implementation of road construction and maintenance to the private sector, the loss of&#13;
some personnel to the private sector is acceptable (it can be assumed that the private&#13;
sector will raise salary scales to compete effectively with Ethiopia). On the other hand, it&#13;
will be imperative that RTCD retains the capacity for contract administration as well as&#13;
other key personnel. The conversion of RTCD into an autonomous roads' authority,&#13;
outside the civil service, will offer RTCD the potential to react flexibly to the changing&#13;
economic environment.&#13;
Alternative Project Funding&#13;
31.   During project preparation, discussions were held with both the European Union&#13;
(EU) and UNDP. The EU has already developed a substantial program of assistance for&#13;
the road sector, including limited technical assistance. This project will complement the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
EU on-going and planned activities. UNDP were supportive of the project but the road&#13;
sector is outside its priority assistance program.&#13;
Actions Agreed&#13;
32.   The following conditions for Project Effectiveness have been agreed:&#13;
(i)    Confirmation by GOE that the local costs for the first year of the project&#13;
have been included in the Budget;&#13;
(ii)  Identification of the counterparts assigned to the contract administration&#13;
and bridge survey components and confirmation by GOE that these&#13;
counterparts will be able to work full-time with the technical advisers; and&#13;
(iii)  Provision of the engineering designs for the construction of the mechanic&#13;
training facility.&#13;
Other actions agreed:&#13;
(i)    The positions of mechanic and operator trainer will be suitably recognized&#13;
and rewarded within the RTCD salary scales; and&#13;
(ii)   A mid-term project review will be held after fifteen months of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;

Counterparts will be selected from within RTCD staff, although additional engineers&#13;
from elsewhere in the Ministry of Construction may also be attached to the contract&#13;
administration component. Candidates for the training as mechanic and electrician&#13;
trainers will be selected by RTCD on the recommendation of the mechanic trainers.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
38.   All consulting services, spare parts, vehicles and equipment will to be procured in&#13;
accordance with the IDA procurement guidelines, using IDA's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents:&#13;
(i)    Consulting Services: these will be procured following IDA's Guidelines&#13;
for the Employment of Consultants, adopting the time based contract for&#13;
complex assignments, and incorporating price in the evaluation of&#13;
proposals with a weighting of 20 percent;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
(ii)    Spare parts: where spare parts for equipment to be repaired/rehabilitated&#13;
are commonly available from several sources, Limited International&#13;
Bidding (LIB) will be used to procure these parts competitively from&#13;
suppliers approved by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). LIB,&#13;
using OEM suppliers, will avoid the problem of counterfeit spare parts.&#13;
Certain spare parts may only be obtainable from the original equipment&#13;
manufacturer and will, therefore, be procured through Direct Contracting&#13;
(DC). A provisional sum of US$50,000 (5 percent of the total) will be&#13;
included in the consultant's contract for the rapid procurement of&#13;
unforeseen spares or materials needed in rehabilitating existing equipment&#13;
(spare parts will be procured from the OEM or approved agent);&#13;
(iii)   Vehicles, computers and related office equipment: subject to IDA&#13;
approval, these will be procured through the UNDP's Inter-Agency&#13;
Procurement Service, IAPSO;&#13;
(iv)   Civil works: these will be constructed by RTCD, using its own resources.&#13;
The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 1.&#13;

The proposed project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2000, and the Credit&#13;
Closing Date will be December 31, 2000. An estimated schedule of disbursement of the&#13;
proceeds from the Credit is shown in Table 3. All disbursements will be fully&#13;
documented to the satisfaction of the Association. Payments for goods for amounts less&#13;
than US$100,000, and for all training, will be disbursed under Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOE). Documents verifying expenditures under the SOE procedure will be retained for&#13;
review by IDA supervision missions. To facilitate the availability of funds for the&#13;
Project, a Special Account would be established and maintained on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. An initial deposit of US$200,000 will be made against an authorized&#13;
allocation of US$400,000, which will become available when disbursements will have&#13;
reached SDR 2,000,000.&#13;

Project Supervision&#13;
40.   IDA will send a supervision mission to 'launch' the project, soon after project&#13;
effectiveness. A Project Launch Workshop will be organized during this mission for&#13;
RTCD senior and middle management involved in the implementation of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
The mission will ensure that RTCD is fully briefed on the necessary procurement and&#13;
disbursement procedures (Special Account operations and replenishments, withdrawal&#13;
applications etc.) and that the accounting systems for the necessary project accounting are&#13;
in place. Subsequently, supervision missions will be undertaken at approximately 6&#13;
month intervals, following receipt of progress reports from RTCD. These supervision&#13;
missions will review progress, assess the extent to which the project is meeting its&#13;
objectives; and help resolve issues with regard to either the project or IDA procedures.&#13;
41.   A mid-term review, approximately 15 months after project effectiveness, will&#13;
undertake a more intensive review of project implementation and the achievement of&#13;
project objectives. The mission will agree measures with RTCD and GOE to remedy any&#13;
unresolved problems, decide on the utilization of any uncommitted funds, and develop an&#13;
action plan for the remainder of the project. The mission may also be an opportune time&#13;
to discuss further IDA assistance to the road sector.&#13;
42.   During the six months prior to the closing date of the project, an Implementation&#13;
Completion mission will assess, with RTCD, the success of the project in meeting its&#13;
objectives, as the basis for preparing the Implementation Completion Report (a&#13;
requirement for all IDA projects) within six months following the closing date.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
43.   The Project Coordinator will be responsible for the maintenance of accounts for&#13;
the project (including counterpart funds) and for arranging their annual audit. Accounts&#13;
will be maintained using computer based accounting software; the software and systems&#13;
developed for the Eritrean Community Development Fund Project are thought to be&#13;
adaptable to the needs of this project. For the efficient management of project resources,&#13;
the accounting system will allow: (i) the production of annual financial statements in&#13;
accordance with International Accounting Standards in a forrm suitable for audit and&#13;
include integrated accounts; (ii) reflect the performance of each component of the project,&#13;
in comparison with annual budget and project appraisal estimates; and (iii) permit&#13;
efficient management of external funds by category of expenditure and in the currency of&#13;
the funding. Trial Balances and financial reports, summarizing this information, will be&#13;
produced by the 15th of each month following the month to which they relate.&#13;
44.   Annual Financial Statements will include a Balance Sheet and Statements of&#13;
Operating Expenses and movements of Funds. They will be audited, in accordance with&#13;
International Standards on Auditing, by an independent auditor acceptable to the&#13;
Association. The audit report will be provided to IDA no later than six months following&#13;
the end of the Government's fiscal year. The auditor's report will include a statement on&#13;
the adequacy or otherwise of the accounting system and internal controls, and the&#13;
reliability of statements of expenditure as a basis for credit disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Project Reporting&#13;
45.   The primary project components consist of consultant studies or technical&#13;
assistance. Progress reporting on the details of the project will form part of the Terms of&#13;
Reference of the study consultants or technical assistance experts. In addition to the&#13;
specific technical reports (feasibility study, detailed design, bridge inventory, contract&#13;
manuals etc.) the consultants will prepare (a) inception reports within one month of&#13;
mobilization; (b) bi-monthly progress reports; and (c) final reports.&#13;
46.   RTCD will also prepare a six monthly report for submission to IDA. The report&#13;
will outline the progress in project implementation, the status of each of the components,&#13;
the financial commitment and disbursements made under the project, and any issues&#13;
which have to be resolved. The report will also summarize RTCD management's&#13;
assessment of the "knowledge and skills' transfer and any further actions required. The&#13;
report will forn the agenda for the subsequent IDA supervision mission.&#13;
47.   A mid-term review report will be prepared by the Borrower as the basis for the&#13;
mid-term review.&#13;

THE STATE OF ERITREA&#13;
ROAD SECTOR ENGINEERING PROJECT&#13;
TRAINING PLAN&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The need for increased institutional capacity has been recognized as a priority in&#13;
Eritrea. The staff of the Road Transport Construction Department (RTCD) are highly&#13;
motivated but lack expertise in certain important areas: (i) the administration and&#13;
supervision of works undertaken, under contract, by the private sector; (ii) modem spare&#13;
parts' management and procurement systems; (iii) the specialist mechanical skills&#13;
necessary for the maintenance and repair of heavy plant and equipment; (iv) soils and&#13;
material testing; and (v) bridge condition and structural strength analysis. This project&#13;
will address these skill areas and provide capacity building and training in order to&#13;
remedy the identified deficiencies.&#13;
Recruitment of Trainees&#13;
2.   In almost all components, the staff for training will be drawn from the regular&#13;
staff of RTCD. The exception will be in the component for training in contract&#13;
administration under which: (i) additional personnel from other branches of the Ministry&#13;
of Construction may be attached as counterparts; and (ii) seminars by the contract&#13;
administration expert may be given to a wider audience of GOE officials involved in&#13;
contract administration.&#13;
Training Mode&#13;
3.    Training in most project components will be undertaken through in-service and&#13;
supervised work experience training. The technical advisers will be provided with small&#13;
groups of full-time counterparts with whom the expert will work and transfer the requisite&#13;
skills and techniques. The basic exceptions to the small counterpart group approach are&#13;
with respect to the training of mechanics and the training of mechanic trainers. A formal&#13;
training approach is adopted for the mechanics, although most of the training will be&#13;
provided by closely supervised work experience. The training mode(s) in each of the&#13;
project components is detailed below:&#13;
&#13;

Mechanic Training    Heavy plant mechanical skills    Classroom training&#13;
In-country courses by suppliers&#13;
Supervised repair of equipment&#13;
Mechanic Trainers   Pedagogic skills and techniques   Specialist overseas training&#13;
Plant Operator      Improved operator techniques    In-country one-to-one training&#13;
Trainer             Basic pedagogic skills&#13;
For the training of mechanic trainers, candidates will be selected from the existing Grade&#13;
I mechanics and sent to appropriate courses overseas. These will be the only overseas&#13;
training courses provided under the Project.&#13;
Training Design and Monitoring&#13;
4.    The broad design of the training program will form part of the technical proposals&#13;
from the consultants and will be evaluated as part of the selection process. The detailed&#13;
training program will form part of the Consultant's Inception Report and will be&#13;
discussed and agreed with the RTCD. With regard to the training of trainers through&#13;
overseas courses, the Consultant will identify the potential courses and make&#13;
recommendations to RTCD management for decision.&#13;
5.    The training programs will be monitored by the Heads of the relevant Divisions in&#13;
RTCD and by the overall project coordinating committee. To assist with the monitoring&#13;
both the technical experts and the counterparts will complete regular assessments of the&#13;
training program, detailing the achievements and problems with the program as well as&#13;
the performance of the expert/trainer and the counterparts/trainees.&#13;

Expected Results of Training&#13;
6.    The training under the project will provide RTCD with in-house capacity for soils&#13;
and materials testing, bridge structural testing and analysis, and contract administration.&#13;
In addition, the spares' management and procurement systems will be improved and staff&#13;
trained in their use, and RTCD's mechanical maintenance capacity and capability will be&#13;
substantially enhanced.&#13;
Re-Entry of Trainees into RTCD&#13;
7.    This will not be a problem as the training proposed, with the exception of the&#13;
short overseas courses for mechanic trainers, will be undertaken as in-service training or&#13;
supervised work experience. The Trainees will thus continue to work within RTCD&#13;
throughout the training period.&#13;

            Eritrea - Road Sector Engineering Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objectives of the Road
            Sector Engineering Project are to: (1) provide the economic
            and design analysis to improve road infrastructure, which
            will improve market linkages, promote economic growth and
            thereby alleviate poverty, as well as facilitate access to
            public health and education services; (2) establish contract
            administration capacity within the Road Transport
            Construction Department (RTCD) to facilitate private sector
            involvement in road and bridge works; and (3) improve the
            efficiency of RTCD's force account maintenance and
            construction capacity. The project comprises two components:
            (1) Infrastructure strengthening studies, including a
            feasibility study and environmental impact assessment to
            determine design and construction standards for road
            rehabilitation and upgrading, followed by detailed
            engineering designs for civil works; and a national bridge
            condition and structural strength survey to develop a
            prioritized program of bridge works. (2) Institutional
            strengthening, including technical assistance and training
            for RTCD personnel in contract administration organization,
            systems and procedures; hands-on training to upgrade
            mechanical skills, including spare parts for the training
            program; training of trainers (both in-house and overseas);
            and construction of a small training facility and workshop,
            including basic workshop equipment and training aides.
