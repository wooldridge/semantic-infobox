            the telecommunications industry. The end of natural
            monopoly, the breakdown of the old pricing mechanisms, the
            increasing competition from new operators and new products,
            and the globalization of the industry are forcing radical
            change. This spells trouble for incumbent telecommunications
            operators -most of whose assets are holes in the ground.
            Many incumbents are responding by forming global alliances.
            But this trend may have more to do with their desire to
            recreate in international markets the oligarchies they are
            used to at home than with the underlying market forces.
            Where is the industry heading? One view of the future sees
            transmission capacity and bandwidth becoming tradable
            commodities, with the industry fragmenting into wholesalers
            investing in capacity, brokers intermediating supply and
            demand for capacity, and retailers dealing with the consumer.
