&#13;
ï»¿Attachment 1&#13;
CGAP Charter&#13;
Adopted on May 14, 2014&#13;
(provided for informational purposes only)&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.     The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) is a global partnership of organizations that&#13;
seek to advance financial inclusion for the poor. CGAP develops innovative solutions to address barriers&#13;
to financial inclusion through practical research and active engagement with financial service providers,&#13;
policy makers, and funders.&#13;
2.     Established in 1995, CGAP initially played a critical role in building a sustainable microfinance&#13;
industry, facilitating consensus around good practice standards and helping to professionalize the field.&#13;
Starting in the mid-2000s, CGAP focused on promoting a diversity of financial services and providers,&#13;
and in particular technology and business model innovations that have the potential to dramatically&#13;
increase the scale and lower the costs of financial services for poor people.&#13;
3.     Today, CGAP is a leading global resource on financial inclusion for the poor. CGAP acts&#13;
through high-level advocacy, research and knowledge sharing on client demand, support for product and&#13;
business model innovation, policy advice, and guidelines and standards for donor effectiveness.&#13;
4.     CGAP pursues a global solutions agenda through a portfolio of high-impact initiatives that evolve&#13;
over time to adapt to changing market developments. CGAP's work on frontier issues crowds-in private,&#13;
social, and public sector entities and reflects the two central purposes of subsidized catalytic capital in the&#13;
promotion of inclusive market development: (i) the generation of open knowledge, open data, and related&#13;
practical insights of a public good nature, and (ii) private and public sector experimentations that&#13;
demonstrate viable product and business model innovations.&#13;
5.     CGAP is guided by five-year strategic frameworks. Its current five year framework, Advancing&#13;
Financial Inclusion to Improve the Lives of the Poor, Strategic Directions FY2014 - FY2018 (CGAP V),&#13;
was endorsed in May 2013 by CGAP's Council of Governors.&#13;
6.     CGAP is supported by more than 30 member organizations including government ministries,&#13;
bilateral and multilateral development agencies, development finance institutions and foundations&#13;
committed to advancing financial access for the poor. CGAP is housed in the World Bank and is funded&#13;
through member contributions to trust funds administered by the World Bank.&#13;
7.     CGAP's governance structure comprises a Council of Governors, an Executive Committee, and&#13;
an Operational Team.&#13;
CGAP COUNCIL OF GOVERNORS&#13;
8.     The Council of Governors ("CG") is CGAP's highest governing body. The CG is chaired by the&#13;
World Bank and meets in person at least once per year as part of the "CGAP Annual Meeting". The&#13;
CGAP Annual Meeting is the venue for discussion of CG business matters, and for exchange on&#13;
developments and key challenges related to CGAP's strategic priorities.&#13;
CG Membership&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿9.     Membership in the CG includes the World Bank and is open to organizations that support&#13;
CGAP's vision and mission statements. Organizations may become CG members by contributing&#13;
unrestricted funding to CGAP trust funds that support the implementation of the applicable five year&#13;
strategic framework ("Core Funding"). On an exceptional basis and subject to the approval of the CG :&#13;
(a)    CG members that express their intention to contribute Core Funding may remain CG&#13;
members provided their contribution is made effective within a reasonable period.&#13;
(b)    Organizations may become CG members by providing in-kind contributions in support of&#13;
the work plan and budget of the Operational Team (described below).&#13;
(c)    A  government organization providing Core Funding can form    a consortium&#13;
("Consortium") with other national organizations supported by the same government, in&#13;
which case the Consortium will be the CG member.&#13;
10.    Each CG member appoints a representative to the CG ("CGAP Focal Point") and confirms, on an&#13;
annual basis or as needed in case of changes, to the Operational Team the name and contact information&#13;
of its CGAP Focal Point.&#13;
11.    CG members not meeting the requirements of paragraph 9 are expected to resign by way of&#13;

Decision-Making&#13;
14.    Documents and other decision materials for CG approval are prepared by the Operational Team.&#13;
The CG endeavors to make all decisions by consensus. If all practical efforts made do not lead to&#13;
consensus, the CG Chair may call for a vote. Decisions put to a vote are made on the basis of a simple&#13;
majority of the full CG, provided that such decisions; (i) do not conflict with terms of the administration&#13;
agreements between CG members and the World Bank as trustee of CGAP trust funds; (ii) must be made&#13;
with the agreement of the World Bank to the extent they relate to the roles and responsibilities performed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿by the World Bank; and (iii) do not conflict with the policies and procedures of any CG member&#13;
organization. Each CG member has one vote in decisions made by the CG. The member organizations of&#13;
the Consortium share one vote.&#13;
15.    Decisions can be made both in person, including by video or audio, at the CGAP Annual Meeting&#13;
or other CG meeting, or electronically on a non-objection basis. If a CG member is unable to send a&#13;
representative to a meeting at which a decision is being considered for approval, that CG member may&#13;
provide inputs, including a vote if applicable, electronically or by telephone at the time of the meeting.&#13;
The Operational Team will make arrangements for such inputs and/or votes to be reflected in the final&#13;
decision.&#13;
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE&#13;
16.   The Executive Committee (ExCom) advises, supports the work of, and is accountable to the CG.&#13;
It serves as the communications link between CG members and the Operational Team.&#13;
17.    The ExCom meets in person three times per year, once in conjunction with the CGAP Annual&#13;
Meeting. The ExCom Chair may call additional meetings as necessary. All ExCom members are eligible&#13;
to vote on ExCom matters.&#13;
18.    ExCom members will not be compensated for their time, but costs associated with At-Large&#13;
Excom member attendance at ExCom, CG meetings and other meetings (travel, hotel, per diem) will be&#13;
covered by CGAP trust fund resources allocated for that purpose.&#13;
Membership&#13;
19.    Composition. The ExCom has eleven members: one representative for each of the five&#13;
constituencies (see para 20 below), four At-Large selected as individuals based on technical knowledge&#13;
and leadership in CGAP strategic priorities; one representative of the World Bank; and the Chief&#13;
Executive Officer as ex-officio. All ExCom members are expected to be recognized experts in the area of&#13;
financial inclusion and to act in a manner consistent with CGAP's vision and mission.&#13;
20.    Constituency Representation. CG members are represented on the ExCom according to&#13;
constituencies. There are five constituencies based on organization type to which CG members are&#13;
assigned: two for bilateral donor organizations, one for development finance institutions, one for&#13;
foundations and one for multilateral organizations. Individual member organizations of a Consortium are&#13;
assigned to a constituency based on their organization type. However, no more than one member&#13;
organization of a given Consortium may serve on the ExCom at any given time. The number and&#13;
composition of constituencies may change from time to time reflecting changes in CG membership.&#13;
21.    Constituency Representative Selection:  ExCom members representing constituencies are&#13;
selected from among members of the given constituency, through a nomination and election process&#13;
initiated by the ExCom Chair and supported by the Operational Team. Decisions on ExCom members are&#13;
by consensus if possible, and if not, by simple majority vote of the full constituency.&#13;
22.    At-Large Member Selection: At-Large members are elected by the CG. The process for&#13;
nominating candidates for At-Large membership is initiated and led by a nomination committee&#13;
comprising the ExCom Chair and three to five CG members selected by the ExCom Chair in consultation&#13;
with the full ExCom. The nomination committee undertakes broad consultation with the CG and industry&#13;
experts and solicits names of potential candidates. The nomination committee conducts due diligence on&#13;
the most promising candidates and nominates to the CG one candidate per open At-Large ExCom seat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿23.    Member Terms: ExCom member terms are three years beginning on July 1 following selection.&#13;
All ExCom members are eligible to serve a succeeding two year term. Elected ExCom members must be&#13;
re-elected to such succeeding term. In exceptional circumstances, the CG may approve an extension of an&#13;
ExCom member's term for up to one additional year. If an elected ExCom member is unable to serve a&#13;
full term, the ExCom Chair will initiate the process of selection of that member's successor. The term of&#13;
the newly selected ExCom member will be the period from the date of selection to the end of the term of&#13;
their predecessor plus three years starting July I after their selection. ExCom membership is not&#13;
transferrable.&#13;
24.    ExCom members are expected to be willing and able to serve their applicable term and to&#13;
dedicate sufficient time to fulfil ExCom roles and responsibilities&#13;

made on the basis of a simple majority of the full ExCom. Each ExCom member has one vote on&#13;
decisions made by the ExCom.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between the&#13;
Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to&#13;
time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its&#13;
framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of&#13;
Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the&#13;
relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United&#13;
Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under&#13;
the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual&#13;
member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be&#13;
kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has&#13;
legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit&#13;
Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate&#13;
obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete&#13;
activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any&#13;
responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies&#13;
as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust&#13;
funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust&#13;
Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an&#13;
amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management and&#13;
Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the Administration Agreements in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis&#13;
up to a maximum of three percent (3%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund&#13;
Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first&#13;
Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank&#13;
reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would&#13;
be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would&#13;
thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement&#13;
existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1    The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds deposited in&#13;
the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
4.2    The Bank shall furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the World&#13;
Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all commitments and&#13;
liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial&#13;
information relating to receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to&#13;
the Contributions shall be made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center&#13;
secure website.&#13;
4.3    The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure&#13;
website, within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit report,&#13;
comprising (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's external auditors&#13;
concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust&#13;
funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the&#13;
Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4    If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an&#13;
external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange&#13;
for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect&#13;
to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
4.5    The Bank shall make available to the Donors copies of all financial statements and auditors'&#13;
reports received by the Bank from Recipients pursuant to any Grant Agreements (as defined below) in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Access to Information Policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿5.     Progress Reporting&#13;
5.1    The Bank shall provide the Donors with semi-annual reports on the progress of activities financed&#13;
by the Contributions. Within six (6) months of the End Disbursement Date (as defined below), the Bank&#13;
shall furnish to the Donors a final report on the activities financed by the Trust Fund.&#13;
5.2    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up to six (6)&#13;
months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank shall agree on the scope and&#13;
conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits&#13;
of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by&#13;
the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not&#13;
constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by&#13;
June 30, 2019 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds deposited in the Trust&#13;
Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to&#13;
the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration Agreements&#13;
of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of&#13;
the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective&#13;
Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund&#13;
by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as&#13;
Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
6.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel all or&#13;
any Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions (paid and&#13;
not yet paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the Bank and any&#13;
consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any&#13;
Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return&#13;
to the Donor its pro-rata share in the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement;&#13;
unless otherwise agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this Trust&#13;
Fund in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into Administration&#13;
Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Agreements and&#13;
such related information.&#13;
7.2    The Donors and the Bank shall use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute, controversy,&#13;
or claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Agreements.&#13;
8.     Grants to Recipients&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿8.1    The Bank shall, as administrator of the Trust Fund on behalf of the Donors, enter into one or&#13;

Donors.&#13;
