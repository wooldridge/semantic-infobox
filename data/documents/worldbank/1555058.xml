WOMEN IN THE URBAN LABOR MARKETS OF AFRICA: THE CASE OF TANZANIA&#13;
The low status of women in the modern sector in Africa has been&#13;
commented on by many authors but very few studies have sought to explain the&#13;
reasons for the disparity in employment opportunities in the modern sector&#13;
between men and women in Africa. This study seeks to fill the gap in the&#13;
literature by using the results of the 1971 Tanzanian National Urban Mobility,&#13;
Employment and Income Survey (NUMEIST) to focus specifically on urban women&#13;
and their labor market performance. The study examines the structure and&#13;
characteristics of the female urban labor force, the determinants of female&#13;
employment and labor earnings and attempts to ascertain whether sex differ-&#13;
ences in labor market performance can be attributed to sex discrimination.&#13;
Apart from the constraints arising out of the general economic situation&#13;
in the country, factors that emerge as important determinants of female&#13;
employment status are: marital status, nature of female dependence on the&#13;
husband and educational attainment. The analysis of differentials in labor&#13;
earnings indicatesthat, while African urban women may not suffer appreciably&#13;
from sex discrimination, either in terms of wage level or as a result of&#13;
occupational segregation, the urban women's low economic status in the labor&#13;
force is primarily a result of cumulative discrimination over time in both the&#13;
provision of and the demand for educational services. This has had the effect&#13;
of limiting the supply of women in the urban labor force and making the female&#13;
labor supply curve less elastic than that of men. The paper discusses some&#13;
policy options that governments may wish to adopt to remedy the situation.&#13;

CHAPTER 1&#13;
INTRODUCTION and SUMMARY&#13;
1.1 Objective&#13;
Despite considerable literature on urbanization and the problems&#13;
associated with surplus urban labor in Africa, few attempts have been made to&#13;
study the process of urbanization of women and the performance of women in&#13;
the urban labor market. It may be argued that urban problems of under util-&#13;
ization and their principal forms, under-employment and unemployment, are&#13;
shared by men and women and that policy prescriptions arising out of research&#13;
on unemployment as it affects men are also applicable to women, but many of&#13;
the problems women encounter in the urban economy and the labor market are&#13;
sex specific. Some of these problems are associated with their life cycle&#13;
commitments, while others arise because of the low status of women in society.&#13;
A man at the end of his educational training is expected to enter the labor&#13;
force and to remain there, assuming that there are jobs available, until&#13;
retirement; a woman's entry into the labor force is conditioned by her plans&#13;
relating to marriage and childbearing, as well as by the social expectations&#13;
of what role she should assume in society. In Africa, although society&#13;
expects her to enter the labor market, she is still expected to fulfill her&#13;
role relating to procreation and family responsibilities.&#13;
While labor market conditions in the rural sector may make it&#13;
possible for a woman to pursue dual careers (and most African women do so),&#13;
conditions in the urban areas are less conducive than in rural areas to the&#13;
combination of home and market activities. Furthermore, in the urban&#13;
environment, where the necessity for a woman to work is even more pressing&#13;
for some families owing to the husband's low income and increased family&#13;
wants, women have more severe problems in adjusting to unfamiliar life styles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Urbanization is a fairly recent phenomenon in Africa and most urban dwellers&#13;
are first generation or recent immigrants. The inability to draw on the&#13;
support of the wider extended family so readily available in the rural areas&#13;
affects women more intensely than men. The low status of women in the modern&#13;
sector in Africa has been commented on, but very few studies have sought to&#13;
explain the reasons for the disparity in employment opportunities in the&#13;
modern sector between men and women. This study seeks to fill the gap in&#13;
the literature by focusing specifically on urban African women and their&#13;
labor market performance. A subsidiary but important reason for a study&#13;
focusing specifically on urban women is the importance of female employment&#13;
as a means of providing women with an alternative source of satisfaction to&#13;
that derived from having children. In high-fertility African countries,&#13;
where female status derives almost entirely from the motherhood role, many&#13;
women feel compelled to have as many children as possible. Research results&#13;
indicate that modern sector employment can offer women viable partial&#13;
alternatives to marriage and motherhood. Thus, studies which seek to shed&#13;
light on the employment status of women in urban areas of Africa should be&#13;
useful to policy makers.&#13;
The objectives of this study therefore are to ascertain the char-&#13;
acteristics of the women in the urban labor market and to compare the labor&#13;
market performance of men and women in the urban economy. Some of the ques-&#13;
tions we hope to address are: Are there sex differentials in employment&#13;
status and earnings? If differentials exist, to what factors can they be&#13;
attributed? Are they explained by differences in education and job train-&#13;
ing, or are they even a result of discrimination? And finally, what steps&#13;
might be taken to close the gap between the sexes and help further integrate&#13;
women into the urban economy?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.2 Data Source&#13;
As a principal source of information, Tanzania has been selected&#13;
for this study because there are fairly good household data on employment&#13;
and income in the urban areas. The 1971 National Urban, Mobility, Employ-&#13;
ment and Income Survey (NUMEIST) provides a rich source of data suitable&#13;
for an analysis of this type. The survey covered 5,000 persons from seven&#13;
urban centers in Tanzania. These are: Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Mwanza, Tanga,&#13;
Tabora, Dodoma and Mbeya. The sample selection and enumeration procedures&#13;
are described by Sabot. 1/ The other reason for concentrating on Tanzania&#13;
is that in the Arusha Declaration, 1967, the Tanzania Government committed&#13;
itself to a policy of sexual equality and has since taken considerable steps&#13;
to ensure that both urban and rural women benefit from this policy.&#13;
This study is not restricted to Tanzania, but has tried where&#13;
possible to include information from other African countries. While it&#13;
can be said that each country's position is fairly unique, we feel confident&#13;
that the analysis and the conclusions of this study are applicable to the&#13;
majority of sub-Saharan African countries.&#13;
1.3 Chapter Summary&#13;
Previous studies have shown that rural-urban migration in Africa&#13;
has been predominantly male and until fairly recently there has been very&#13;
little female migration into urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa. In the past,&#13;
given the short-term nature of male urban migration, it was most unusual&#13;
for wives to accompany husbands to town. However, in the post-second&#13;
world war period, there was a sharp increase in the size of the female&#13;

Tanzania. Clarendon Press 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
urban population as indicated by the sex ratios of major African urban areas.&#13;
Since the increase cannot be explained by the natural rate of increase&#13;
alone, it indicates a shift in the pattern of female migration. Chapter 2&#13;
discusses the reasons for this phenomenon. There was a shift in male migra-&#13;
tion patterns from short-term to long-term during this period. Consequently,&#13;
the move to the city involved whole families instead of just the male member&#13;
as in the past. During the post-war period, the rate of male migration into&#13;
urban areas increased sharply, owing to increased economic opportunities in&#13;
the modern sector. Since the rate of female migration derives to a large&#13;
extent from male migration, it was inevitable that this would have an effect&#13;
on the rate of entry of female urban migrants.&#13;
Although the proportion of female migrants who came as economic&#13;
dependents remained high, the rate of migration of unattached females grew&#13;
at a much higher rate than that of married females, indicating that women&#13;
migrants were also responding to the same economic motives for migrating as&#13;
the men. A factor contributing to this was education. During the 1960s,&#13;
there was a net increase in the number of women in educational institutions&#13;
in Africa. Given the educational selectivity of the migration process in&#13;
Africa, it was not surprising that the process should also affect women. To&#13;
the educated woman, the urban economy offered the probability of employment&#13;
towards which school curricula have been directed, as well as the oppor-&#13;
tunity for upward social mobility.&#13;
Given the high female labor-force participation in rural Africa&#13;
and the numerical importance of women in the urban population (50% of urban&#13;
work age population are women), Chapter 3 examines the structure and char-&#13;
acteristics of the female urban labor force. It begins with an analysis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of its socio-economic characteristics. The important point to emerge is&#13;
that although women make up approximately 50% of the urban work age popula-&#13;
tion, there are very few women in the formal sector of the urban economy,&#13;
where educational attainment is a pre-requisite. Using the broadest defini-&#13;
tion of employment, we find that in Tanzania, approximately 21% of the urban&#13;
women are employed compared with 80% of the men. The majority of women urban&#13;
labor force participants are in job situations not very different from that&#13;
of rural women. An examination of the occupational distribution of women&#13;
indicates the beginning of a pattern of concentration of women in few occupa-&#13;
tions similar to the pattern in developed countries, although the pattern&#13;
has yet to become as pronounced as in Kenya.&#13;
Chapter 4 examines the determinants of female employment in Africa.&#13;
Apart from constraints arising out of the general economic situation in the&#13;
country, factors that emerge as important determinants are marital status and&#13;
the nature of female dependence on the husband, the presence of children and&#13;
educational attainment. The chapter hypothesizes that education by itself&#13;
cannot ensure access to employment, but that the chances of being employed are&#13;
greatly improved by the nature and length of a woman's on-the-job experience,&#13;
especially in a tight labor market situation. Finally, a labor supply func-&#13;
tion using household survey data from urban Tanzania was estimated. The&#13;
results of empirical analysis confirm the importance of wage, education and&#13;
household status as determinants of labor force participation. Moreover,&#13;
education is an important factor in determining whether or not a woman finds&#13;
employment in the formal sector.&#13;
Given the wide differentials in earnings and labor force status&#13;
of men and women in urban Africa, Chapter 5 examines the determinants of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
labor earnings and attempts to ascertain whether sex differences in labor&#13;
market performance can be attributed to sex discrimination. Important&#13;
reasons for differential earnings are women's low level of human capital and&#13;
skills which preclude them from high-level jobs with high remuneration. The&#13;
preponderance of women in the informal sector of the urban labor market can&#13;
be explained by the fact that education is not a prerequisite for entry into&#13;
employment in this sector. However, since high remuneration in this sector&#13;
is dependent on capital outlay and many women lack this, their prospects of&#13;
earning high incomes are severely limited.&#13;
The empirical estimation of the earnings function confirms that&#13;
women do not suffer from sex discrimination, but that labor income is highly&#13;
correlated with educational attainment. This leads to a discussion of the&#13;
reasons for African women's comparatively low educational attainment vis-a-vis&#13;
that of African men. The conclusion from the evidence presented is that,&#13;
while there may not be sex discrimination in urban Africa either in terms of&#13;
wage level or occupational segregation, women's low status in the labor force&#13;
is a result of cumulative discrimination over time in both the provision of&#13;
and the demand for educational services. This has had the effect of limiting&#13;
the supply of women in the labor force and making the female labor supply&#13;
curve less elastic than that of men. Supply differences between men and women&#13;
are determined by family decisions and have been reinforced by Government&#13;
action. Expansion of female skilled labor has been prevented by discrimina-&#13;
tory practices of fathers who do not give their daughters access to education&#13;
similar to that of their sons and by the governments who do not provide&#13;
sufficient training facilities to women. Chapter 6 contains the policy&#13;
implications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
Policy suggestions that have emerged from this study are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(1) Girls should be provided with more access to education&#13;
by making all schools coeducational and ensuring that&#13;
the school intake reflects the ratio of the sexes in&#13;
the population and also that girls are not automatically&#13;
put into an inferior educational stream which would&#13;
not give them a chance of competing in high status and&#13;
high income jobs.&#13;
(2) Major efforts should be made to expand and modify the&#13;
adult education system, so that the current illiterate,&#13;
underemployed and poor urban women may have an oppor-&#13;
tunity of upgrading their skills and ability and thereby&#13;
increasing their income.&#13;
(3) The educational system should also be restructured so&#13;
that provision is made for the school dropouts and older&#13;
people to re-enter the system and obtain education which&#13;
would improve their earning potential.&#13;

CHAPTER 2&#13;
URBANIZATION OF WOMEN IN AFRICA&#13;
2.1 Urban Growth in Africa&#13;
Africa is undergoing tremendous structural change and one of the&#13;
most striking characteristics of this change is urbanization. The process&#13;
of urbanization is all the more interesting because when compared with de-&#13;
veloped countries, and even the less developed countries of Asia and Latin&#13;
America, Subsaharan Africa has relatively low urban density. Estimates made&#13;
by Davis 1/ in 1968 indicated that approximately 10% of the population of&#13;
Subsaharan Africa lived in urban centers of 100,000 or more persons. One&#13;
important aspect of urbanization in Africa is that it is fairly recent. Most&#13;
of the increase has occurred during the second half of this century. Avail-&#13;
able statistics indicate that in each of the 1950-60 and 1960-70 decades, the&#13;
increase in urban population in Africa was about 60%. Longitudinal data on&#13;
individual towns are not easily available but such information as exists&#13;
shows that most cities experienced an annual growth rate of about 5% during&#13;
the 1960-1970 decade. Of the cities listed in Table 2.1, Koidu town in&#13;
Sierra Leone, Arusha in Tanzania and Nairobi in Kenya had an estimated annual&#13;
growth rate of about 10%.&#13;
Intercensal data from Tanzania and Kenya on population change of&#13;
major towns are indicative of the tremendous growth of most towns of Sub-&#13;
saharan Africa during the second half of this century. Table 2.1(a) gives&#13;

the annual growth rate of major Tanzanian towns between the intercensal&#13;
period 1948 and 1967. Although the rate of population growth in Tanzania&#13;
during this period was about 3% per annum, only Tabora and Lindi grew at a&#13;
lower rate of 2.4%. Other towns grew at least twice as rapidly. Eldoret&#13;
and Nanyuki were towns in Kenya with annual growth rates less than that of&#13;
the general population (Table 2.1(b)).&#13;
The rapid rate of growth of urban centers in Africa can be attri-&#13;
buted to: (a) the rate of natural increase, and (b) high rural-urban migra-&#13;
tion. Most African countries have experienced very high population growth&#13;
rates in this century, largely because of decline in mortality due to improved&#13;
health services and the introduction of modern medicine. The demographic&#13;
transition theory suggests that the decline in mortality would eventually be&#13;
followed by a decline in fertility. In Africa, this has yet to happen. Crude&#13;
birth rates have continued to be high. Many African countries have crude&#13;
birth rates of between 48 and 50 per thousand (Table 2.2).&#13;
Although one might expect that the urban fertility rate would&#13;
be lower than those of rural areas--a pattern found to exist in developed&#13;
countries--there is conflicting empirical evidence from Africa about this.&#13;
Several studies, for example, Caldwell's Ghana study 1/ have indicated&#13;
lower urban fertility in Africa in recent years. Henin 2/ found that in&#13;
Tanzania in 1967 the crude birth rate in urban areas was 32.7 per thousand&#13;

as against 46.7 per thousand in rural areas. Other studies have held the&#13;
opposite to be true..1/ For Zaire, Romanuike 2/ showed a higher natality&#13;
in urban than in rural areas. This can be attributed to the higher propor-&#13;
tion of urban married women and to the more favorable age structure of the&#13;
urban population since the tendency is for members of the younger age group&#13;
to leave the rural areas. The improvement in urban health conditions may&#13;
have stimulated fertility by increasing fecundity, reducing the risk of&#13;
miscarriage and widowhood. Moreover, most urban residents are recent&#13;
migrants from rural areas, with value systems similar to those of their rural&#13;
counterparts. Not yet having adjusted to a situation where the probability&#13;
of infant mortality is lower than in the rural areas, they have invariably&#13;
tended to overproduce children in the expectation that some would die. This&#13;
theory suggests that given time, urban-rural fertility differentials in most&#13;
African countries would conform to the situation in developed countries.&#13;
However, although fertility is high in both rural and urban areas&#13;
of Africa, the rate of natural increase alone cannot account for the pheno-&#13;
menal growth of urban areas in Africa in the late 1960s and 1970s. The ex-&#13;
planation lies in the tremendous increase in rural-urban migration during&#13;
this period.&#13;
Movement of people from one area to another is not a new phenomenon&#13;
in Africa. In the precolonial period, such movements were motivated by need&#13;

for virgin land to replace exhausted farm lands or by the search of water&#13;
holes. There were also coerced migrations to foreign areas following defeats&#13;
in battles. During the colonial periods, the nature of migration changed&#13;
but the motives were basically economic. The direction of the movement was&#13;
to areas in the country experiencing socioeconomic change - newly established&#13;
plantations, trading depots, etc. Post independence migrations in Africa&#13;
have been predominantly rural - urban in character, although this type of&#13;
migration may be two-staged, that is prospective migrants may migrate in the&#13;
first instance to another rural area or to a small town before migrating to&#13;
a larger entity.&#13;
Data on the migrant share of total urban population are not readily&#13;
available for most countries. Some information can be gleaned from recent&#13;
censuses in which specific questions relating to migrant status of census&#13;
respondents were asked. In Ivory Coast, for instance, 54.5% of the population&#13;
of Abidjan were born outside the city and can be classified as migrants. 1/&#13;
In Accra, Ghana in 1960 and 1970 censuses, migrants into the city accounted&#13;
for 52.3 and 44.9 percent respectively of the total population. In Freetown,&#13;
Sierra Leone, in 1975 34.9 percent of the total population were migrants. 2/&#13;
In 1971 in Tanzania, two-thirds of the total population of urban Tanzania were&#13;
migrants. The distribution of migrant/nonmigrant population for the seven&#13;
towns included in the 1971 Migration and Employment Survey (NUMEIST) is given&#13;
in Table 2.3(a). In all urban areas, the majority of the population were&#13;
recent migrants. Only 28% of the migrants into urban Tanzania originated from&#13;

other urban areas (Table 2.3(b)). Addo 1/ found that in 1966, 50 percent of&#13;
migrants into towns in the Accra Capital District (Ghana) were from other&#13;
urban areas. Almost 49% came from rural areas.&#13;
2.2  Urbanization of Women&#13;
Until fairly recently, migration from one area to another in&#13;
Africa has been predominantly male. Given the historical evolution of towns&#13;
and cities this is not surprising. Urban areas in Africa had their raisons&#13;
d'etre as centers of communication and collecting points for locally produced&#13;
goods or through development of minerals. The incentives to provide labor&#13;
in such centers were specifically directed at the men. 2/ The norm was for&#13;
the men to migrate to sell their labor while the women stayed behind to tend&#13;
the family plots and care for the children. Living conditions in such centers&#13;
of migration did not encourage migration of whole families. Before the&#13;
Second World War, therefore, given the short term nature of migration, it&#13;
was relatively uncommon for women to accompany their husbands, although a&#13;
certain number of widows, deserted wives and other unattached women went&#13;
with the men.&#13;
The situation in Tanzania is illustrative of other areas in Africa&#13;
experiencing rapid social change. In 1948, in Tanzania there were 260 males&#13;
for every 100 females in the labor receiving areas of Tanzania. 3/ By 1971,&#13;

there were 122 males for every 100 females in urban areas. That the propor-&#13;
tion of female residents in urban areas of Africa has increased dramatically&#13;
can also be ascertained by looking at the sex ratios in different African&#13;
countries. In Table 2.4(a) we present the sex ratios of selected urban&#13;
centers of Kenya for 1962 to 1969. Between the intercensal period 1962&#13;
to 1969, each town reduced dramatically the ratio of males to females. The&#13;
ratio of males to 100 females in Nairobi fell from 187 to 147. In Kisumu,&#13;
the ratio fell from 150 to 124. The trend, evident in Kenya, is also present&#13;
in Tanzania. Table 2.4(b) contains the proportion of males to females in&#13;
urban areas for three time periods, 1948, 1957 and 1967. Between 1948 and&#13;
1967, the proportion of females to males in the population of all cities&#13;
increased dramatically. For instance in 1948, there were 197 males for every&#13;
100 females in Kigoma. By 1967, the ratio had fallen to 120 per 100. The&#13;
change in Dar es Salaam was not as dramatic, but was still significant--from&#13;
141 males to 123 males for every 100 females.&#13;
Although time-series data on female migration into urban areas in&#13;
Africa are not readily available, the data from NUMEIST can be used as&#13;
indicative of the process of urbanization of women in Tanzania (Table 2.5).&#13;
Whereas in Table 2.5 we find that before 1950, 33% of all urban migrants were&#13;
women, by 1971 the number had increased to 54 percent of all migrants. What&#13;
are the reasons for this increase in the number of females among migrants?&#13;
Studies 1/ of migration behavior in Africa indicate that the move&#13;
from rural to urban areas is in response to differentials in the price of&#13;

labor between rural and urban areas. In this model, the individual equili-&#13;
brium generates macro imbalances as long as differentials in income persist&#13;
between urban and rural areas. However, the basic assumption of migrants as&#13;
economically motivated and well informed does not always apply to female&#13;
migrants in Africa because, until recently, very little female migration has&#13;
been directed towards jobs. Women have tended to move in response to moves&#13;
by husbands or parents. The data from Tanzania in Table 2.6 is illus-&#13;
trative of the motive of women migrants into urban Africa.&#13;
A high proportion of male migrants, 70 percent, came to seek em-&#13;
ployment. Only 9 percent of the female respondents gave this as a reason.&#13;
Sixty-six percent of the female migrants came initially to join their husbands&#13;
as economic dependents. This point is reinforced by Table 2.7 which indi-&#13;
cates that 66 percent of the total female migrants had no source of income&#13;
and only 13 percent were in wage employment.&#13;

That the rate of female migration into urban areas in Africa de-&#13;
rives to a large extent from male migration is indicated by Table 2.8 on&#13;
marital status of migrants into urban Tanzania by year of arrival. Since&#13;
1952 there has been a rise in the proportion of male migrants who bring their&#13;
wives with them. Gulliver 1/ indicated that migrants were as a matter of&#13;
official policy encouraged after the war by provision of better housing and&#13;
free transportation for dependents to bring their wives with them as a method&#13;
of ensuring minimum preservation of African family life. The nature of mi-&#13;
gration has changed since then from being short-term and temporary to a more&#13;
permanent and long-term process, necessitating moves by whole families.&#13;

As would be expected, the proportion of the immigrants who were mar-&#13;
ried on arrival is considerably higher for women than for men. Furthermore,&#13;
the proportion of unmarried men on arrival remained fairly stable between 1950&#13;
and 1970. The survey indicated that 47 percent of the married migrants were&#13;
1/   op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24 -&#13;
preceded or accompanied by their wives and 15 percent of the wives came within&#13;
six months of the arrival of husbands, while 12 percent came later. Only 25&#13;
percent of the married men were accompanied by wives at the time of arrival.&#13;
Furthermore, unmarried migrants frequently married soon after establishing&#13;
themselves.&#13;
Although the foregoing supports the contention that female migration&#13;
rate derives essentially from the male migration rate, Table 2.9 indicates&#13;
that some women may be migrating in search of better economic opportunities&#13;
just as the men. Over the years, at least in Tanzania and to a large extent&#13;
in other African countries, 1/ there has been an increase in the rate of&#13;
female migrants who are unmarried and migrating in response to different eco-&#13;
nomic opportunities in the rural and urban areas. While the percentage of&#13;
unmarried male migrants at the time of arrival had remained fairly stable&#13;
between 1950-1970, the proportion of unmarried female migrants had increased&#13;
from 13 percent in 1950-1952 to 33 percent in 1970-1971. The rate of migra-&#13;
tion of independent females had risen faster than that of married females.&#13;
The migration of independent females can be explained as a response to price&#13;
differentials between urban and rural areas. The widening urban-rural income&#13;
gap can be cited as an important determinant of the increased rate of migra-&#13;
tion of females. 2/ In 1970, the difference between non-agricultural real&#13;
wage employment and agricultural self-employment in Tanzania was three times&#13;
1/   A recent study in Kenya by ILO indicated that a large number of female&#13;
urban dwellers were household heads and their motive for migrating to&#13;
urban areas was essentially economic.&#13;

what it was in 1958, while within agriculture, the difference between self&#13;
employment and wage employment was approximately four times its earlier&#13;
level. 1/ Given this growing income gap between urban and rural areas, it&#13;
is not surprising that to many rural dwellers the prospects of wage employment&#13;
should be more appealing than self employment in rural areas and that the&#13;
urban centers as the source of this employment should appeal more to them&#13;
than life in the rural areas, despite the uncertainties surrounding such a&#13;
move.&#13;

In the Survey in Tanzania, 21.7 percent of the never-married females&#13;
and 3.7 percent of the ever-married females gave the chance of employment&#13;
as the main reason for migrating. The significant strides made by women in&#13;
education in recent years are probably also responsible for the increase over&#13;
time in the number of women migrating for economic reasons.&#13;

Table 2.10 shows that the proportion of female migrants who came to&#13;
seek employment rose significantly among the better educated; 4 percent for&#13;
those with no education, 5 percent, 14 percent and 20 percent for those with&#13;
standard 1-4, 5-8 and forms 1-6 respectively. A possible explanation for the&#13;
increase among the educated female migrants seeking work is the fact that&#13;
during the 1960s, there was a steady increase in the number of women in educa-&#13;
tional institutions throughout Africa. For example, in all Africa excluding&#13;
the Arab States, the number of female students in educational institutions&#13;
doubled between 1960 and 1970, an increase of about 7% per annum. In Kenya&#13;
and Tanzania there were substantial increases in numbers of both female and&#13;
male students. Over the period, female primary sc0ool enrollment ratios&#13;
increased from 30 percent to 40 percent and 16 percent to 28 percent respec-&#13;
tively. Given the educational selectivity of the migration process in Africa,&#13;
it is not surprising that this process should also affect women.   To the&#13;
educated, the town or urban center represents a notion of hygiene, pur-&#13;
suit of elegance, earning power and higher standards of consumption. 1/&#13;
1/   The attractiveness of urban centers and the urban bias in the provision&#13;
of social and cultural amenities have been emphasized by many writers.&#13;

Furthermore, the urban economy offers the possibility of employment towards&#13;
which school curriculum has been directed, as well as opportunities for upward&#13;
social mobility. 1/&#13;
2.3 Summary&#13;
It has been demonstrated that although urban migration in Africa&#13;
has been predominantly male, in the 1960-1970 decade there was a sharp&#13;
increase in the proportion of female urban migrants, which has continued.&#13;
In Tanzania the proportion of migrants who are women rose from 33 percent&#13;
of all those migrating before 1950 to 54 percent by 1971. The analysis&#13;
indicates that while the proportion of female migrants who came as economic&#13;
dependents remained high, the pull of the city as a source of employment and&#13;
education contributed to the increase in the number of female migrants. The&#13;
resulting change in the sex ratio completely changed the social structure of&#13;
the cities. The influx of such large numbers of women into the urban eco-&#13;
nomy has great implications for labor utilization.&#13;
1/   The importance of the urban area offering the opportunity for upward&#13;
social mobility and its importance as a push factor in the migration&#13;
process has been emphasized by:&#13;

CHAPTER 3&#13;
CHARACTERISTICS AND STRUCTURE OF THE FEMALE URBAN LABOR FORCE&#13;
3.1 Introduction&#13;
In 1971, a report prepared by the UN Economic Commission for Africa&#13;
concluded that the traditional role of African women in economic development&#13;
was neither evident nor even acknowledged in the modern sectors of agricul-&#13;
ture, industry, commerce and government. 1/ To a casual observer this appears&#13;
to be the case in at least as far as the urban economy is concerned. Histori-&#13;
cally, as mentioned in chapter two, male migration was short term and African&#13;
women were new to the urban environment. Recently, however, there has been a&#13;
tendency for very few urban migrants to return to their place of birth. The&#13;
introduction of minimum wages in many African countries as in Tanzania has&#13;
made it easier for urban wage earners to live together in family units. In&#13;
Tanzania, it had the effect of stabilizing urban residence. 2/ The 1971&#13;
Survey revealed that 52 percent of the urban migrants had been in continuous&#13;
residence for three and a half years and 33 percent for more than six years.&#13;
By the 1970s, therefore, African cities had ceased to be dormitories for peas-&#13;
ants supplementing their subsistence income from agriculture. As discussed in&#13;
Chapter 2, by the 1970s there had been a major shift in the sex ratios of most&#13;

urban areas in Africa. In view of the high female labor force participation&#13;
rate in rural Africa (generally estimated at over 80 percent) and their&#13;
numerical importance (over 50 percent of the urban working population are&#13;
women) we now proceed to examine the structure of the urban labor force and&#13;
the labor force performance of women in the urban economy.&#13;
The description of the demographic characteristics of the urban&#13;
female population provides the background to understanding women's role in&#13;
the urban economy of Tanzania. What characterizes urban females can be&#13;
understood in one of two ways: (i) by a comparison with males who make up&#13;
the bulk of the labor force; or (ii) through a description of factors&#13;
unique to females which influence their decisions to enter the labor force.&#13;
This section will begin by discussing the socio-economic characteristics of&#13;
women in urban Tanzania and will proceed to discuss the structure of the&#13;
urban female labor force.&#13;
3.2 Socio-economic Characteristics of the Urban Females&#13;
3.2.1 Demographic Characteristics&#13;
(a) Age Structure&#13;
Figure 3.la contains the age pyramid for the urban population. The&#13;
age profile of the female population as that of males is characterized by a&#13;
considerable concentration among the peak reproductive and prime working age&#13;
groups between 15 and 44 years. This is as one would expect, given the age&#13;
selectivity of the migration process in Tanzania (84.5 percent of the females&#13;
and 83 percent of the males are of these ages). There are some differences&#13;
between the sexes. The concentration in the two youngest age categories is&#13;
slightly greater for females than for males; 21.9 percent of the females, but&#13;

only 15 percent of the males are under 20 years. The pattern, however,&#13;
remains similar except after the age of 59 years, where the proportion of&#13;
females rises from 1.7 percent in the 55-59 age group to 2.1 percent in&#13;
the last two groups. The proportion of males, however, is lower in the&#13;
last two groups than in the 55-59 age group, decreasing from 2.6 percent&#13;
to 2.0 percent and then rising a little to 2.1 percent. The proportion&#13;
of males and females represented increases rapidly to a peak at the 20-24&#13;
age group, 22.3 percent and 22.6 percent respectively, and gradually decreases&#13;
thereafter, with the largest representation among the reproductive and working&#13;
years.&#13;
The patterns vary only slightly from the sub-populations of Dar&#13;
es Salaam and the other six towns. About 83.9 percent and 85.3 percent&#13;
of the females in Dar es Salaam and the other six towns respectively are&#13;
in the peak reproductive and prime working ages.&#13;
(b) Family Status&#13;
In any study involving the performance of women in the labor mar-&#13;
ket, a discussion of the status of women within the household is important&#13;
since a woman' s allocation of time between market work and home work is to&#13;
a great extent governed by her life cycle commitments. Her duties as wife&#13;
and mother determine to a large degree whether or not she can participate&#13;
in the labor force. For all ages in our sample, 73.7 percent of the females&#13;
and 57.1 percent of the males in the urban areas were married. There were&#13;
no significant differences between Dar es Salaam and the six towns in the&#13;
proportion of the population of both sexes who were married. Some 26.4 per-&#13;
cent of all females in the sample were unmarried, with the number in the six&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
towns being slightly more than the proportion of such women in Dar es Salaam&#13;
(30 percent and 23.4 percent respectively).&#13;
The majority of the single category were in the 15-24 age group.&#13;
A large proportion of the unmarried women, 50.1 percent, were daughters of&#13;
heads of household and therefore living within the jurisdiction of their&#13;
parents, and 29.7 percent were boarders in the household. Of the women who&#13;
were separated or divorced or widowed, Table 3.1 indicates that 10.9 percent&#13;
were daughters of heads of household living with their parents and 34 percent&#13;
were boarders, living in the households and presumably within the jurisdiction&#13;
of the head of household. (The age distribution of the women in the sample by&#13;
family status is provided in Figure 3.) Only 17.8 percent of the unmarried&#13;
and 47.9 percent of the divorced or separated women were heads of household.&#13;

(The figures may not add up to 100 due to rounding)&#13;
/a   The unmarried and separate women in this group were living with the heads&#13;
of household and were therefore technically wives of heads of household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Within each age group, there are some sex differences in the&#13;
marital status of the urban population in Tanzania. Table A.1 in the Appendix&#13;
indicates that, while 14.6 percent of the females in the age group 1-14 are&#13;
already married, in general men tend to marry much later than women. For&#13;
each age group, more women than men are married. Although more than half (51&#13;
percent) of the females are married within the 15-19 age group, only 2.1&#13;
percent of the males of the same age fall into that category. The proportion&#13;
of males rises through the next five-year group, but reaches 64.7 percent only&#13;
within the 25-29 age group, whereas by this period, 85 percent of females&#13;
are married. The proportion of married women is highest in the three age&#13;
groups, 25 to 39 years, when it begins to decrease, dropping steadily until&#13;
ages 60-64, where 91.4 percent of the women are married and finally falling&#13;
sharply to as low as 58 percent in the last age group. Correspondingly, the&#13;
proportion of divorced, separated or widowed females increased to 33 percent.&#13;
For males the proportion that is married rises rapidly after each of the age&#13;
groups, 20-24, 25-29 and 30-34, and continues to remain high and even to rise&#13;
somewhat throughout the later ages (Appendix Table A.1).&#13;
More women than men remain widowed, separated or divorced. This is&#13;
particularly striking after the age group 35-39 when the proportion of women&#13;
who are widowed jumped 2 percentage points to 11 percent and continued to rise,&#13;
reaching a peak of 33 percent at the age group about 65 years, whereas for men,&#13;
no such trend was observed. This would indicate that while widowed or sepa-&#13;
rated men at that age are able to remarry, women have a harder time remarry-&#13;
ing after the age of 30. Another interesting factor to emerge from Table A.1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
of the Appendix is the large number (35.2 percent) of female boarders in the&#13;
age group 30-34. The highest proportion of boarders, as one would expect,&#13;
was among the over 65 years age group. The majority of women boarders were&#13;
living as dependents of their children or relatives.&#13;
3.2.2 Education&#13;
The educational system in Tanzania, as in other former protectorates&#13;
and colonies, presents a complex array of options, some of which reflect the&#13;
British tradition, with a curriculum based on subject matters unrelated to&#13;
the realities of the country. There are Government owned, Government aided&#13;
and private schools. The basic educational divisions are primary (Standards&#13;
1-4, 5-8) secondary (Forms 1-4, 5-6) and university. Of all the countries&#13;
forming the defunct East African Community, Tanzania had the lowest proportion&#13;
of children enrolled in school. For instance, in 1960, 16 percent of girls&#13;
aged 6-11 were at school in Tanzania, whereas in Kenya and Uganda, the ratios&#13;
were 30 percent and 32 percent respectively. By 1970, the ratio for Tanzania&#13;
had 'increased to 28 percent while those of Kenya and Uganda were 40 percent&#13;
and 49 percent respectively. 1/&#13;
Table 3.2 contains the distribution of the sampled urban population&#13;
by sex and educational qualification: 52.5 percent of all the women in urban&#13;
Tanzania and 23.6 percent of the men had no education; 22.1 percent of the&#13;
women had attended school up to the upper levels of primary school and only&#13;
8 percent had continued to secondary level. For the sampled population, the&#13;
mean number of years of schooling was 3.3 for women and 5.6 for men (Table&#13;
3.3). Table 3.3 shows that, although both sexes were deprived of educational&#13;
opportunities in the past, men were far better served then women. Recently,&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
however, the gap in educational level between the sexes has considerably&#13;
narrowed, from three years mean difference for the age group 25-29 to 0.6&#13;
years difference for the age group 1-14.&#13;

The low level of female educational attainment has serious im-&#13;
plications for their utilization in the urban formal market where an educa-&#13;
tional qualification is a prerequisite for employment. This is discussed&#13;
at length in the chapters that follow.&#13;
3.2.3 Employment Status of Women in the Urban Labor Market&#13;
(a) Problems of Measurement&#13;
There have been several appraisals of the labor force concepts&#13;
in use in developing countries, and in Africa in particular. 1/ Since our&#13;
objective in this section is to ascertain the size of the employed female&#13;
labor force and the differentials in aggregate employment rates between&#13;
men and women, we offer only a few observations germane to our effort to&#13;
explain female participation in employment in the urban labor market of&#13;
Africa.&#13;
First, it should be noted that observations on labor force acti-&#13;
vities obtained during the reference week are a function of the prevailing&#13;
circumstances, viz., the individual's personal characteristics--age, sex&#13;
and health etc., labor force status of family members, and lastly the eco-&#13;
nomic opportunities confronting the individual.&#13;
A more serious difficulty in estimating aggregate participation&#13;
rates in Africa is the gray area between some employment activities and&#13;
unemployment. On the other hand, the scope of the 'employed' category is&#13;
so wide that it includes all those earning money below the minimum wage,&#13;
whereas housewives who cultivate small town plots, the proceeds from which&#13;
are used for family consumption, are excluded. As a result, most estimates&#13;

and unemployment: International Labor Review, 105; 2, 1972, pp. 155-60.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
of employment based on censuses or surveys tend either to overstate the&#13;
employment rate or to understate the unemployment rate. In Tanzania we&#13;
find that:&#13;
(i) A very high percentage of the labor force are own account&#13;
or unpaid family workers. This is particularly true of a&#13;
large proportion of the female labor force participants. In&#13;
1971, 34.8 percent of the gainfully employed were self-employed&#13;
or unpaid family workers. Among the females, the percentage in&#13;
this category was 48.4 percent. The importance of this char-&#13;
acteristic arises from the fact that the self-employed would&#13;
never be unemployed, even though business might be slack or&#13;
cyclical. This is very true of women in Tanzania who may be&#13;
economically active and productive, but whose earnings from&#13;
such employment are very low or negligible. People in this&#13;
type of situation are invariably left out of the unemployment&#13;
statistics.&#13;
(ii)  The second characteristic of the Tanzanian labor force is that&#13;
there are some people in the employee class who also have another&#13;
employment base. They have a small patch of land which they cul-&#13;
tivate in their spare time. If such people lose their primary&#13;
occupation, they can always devote more time to work in their&#13;
Shamba. 1/ Such people cannot be classified as unemployed even&#13;
though they may only work a few hours a day or a few months a year&#13;
during their period of unemployment, depending on what classifi-&#13;
cation is used. In 1971, 2 percent of all males and 14 percent&#13;
1/   Small plots for food cultivation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
of women reported cultivating their own land. Adding&#13;
this group to the employed would probably reduce the&#13;
unemployment rate by a considerable margin.&#13;
(b) Male/Female Differences in Employment Rates&#13;
We have used three criteria to estimate the aggregate rates of&#13;
urban employment in Tanzania. These are:&#13;
(i) Wage employment. This had the effect of excluding all those not&#13;
in the formal sector of the labor market from the calculation. In Tanzania,&#13;
those in wage/salary employment are numerically very small. According to&#13;
the 1967 census, 2 to 9 percent of the total population, or 10 percent of&#13;
the total working population defined as the population 14 years and over, was&#13;
in this sector. However, its share of the total national income was consider-&#13;
ably larger, amounting to 31 percent in 1967. Our rationale for estimating&#13;
the participation rate of women in this sector is that the size of this sector&#13;
is often used as a guide to the proportion of the economy and the population&#13;
brought into the modern sector. When this criterion is used, the employment&#13;
rate of women in the formal sector in 1971 was 11.9 percent, whereas that of&#13;
men was 65.8 percent (Table 3.4).&#13;

(ii) All persons who have wage and non-wage employment. This included&#13;
all persons who indicated that they were performing some function for which&#13;
they were paid in kind or cash (including those self-employed persons who&#13;
were either producing goods for sale, or unpaid workers in family establish-&#13;
ments). This definition is similar to the definition of employment used in&#13;
the Tanzanian census. Its use, as expected, almost doubled the employment&#13;
rate of women, but increased that of men by only 33.7 percent.&#13;
(iii) Earnings. Mouly 1/ has suggested that employment should denote&#13;
a situation in which remuneration in cash is received in exchange for direct&#13;
personal participation in the production process. Applying this criterion&#13;
to the Tanzanian situation increased the rate of employment of women by the&#13;
same amount as that of men, 3 percent. Table 3.4 indicates that by this&#13;
definition, the rate of employment of women was 15.1 percent. This criterion,&#13;
however, assumes that all those who are working have a living wage. Given&#13;
that in Tanzania, as in many other African countries, there are many in the&#13;
labor force whose labor force activities are of very short duration during the&#13;
day or week and whose earnings from such activities will not adequately meet&#13;
their needs, we attempted to ascertain what the difference to the aggregate&#13;
employment rate of both sexes would be if such persons were excluded. The&#13;
earnings cut-off we adopted was to classify all those who were not earning the&#13;
minimum wage of 180 shillings a month as unemployed. By this criterion, the&#13;
female employment rate in 1971 was 8.9 percent--42 percent lower than the&#13;
rate obtained by the criterion when cash remuneration was used as a basis for&#13;
calculating the employment rate. For men, the rate obtained by this criterion&#13;
1/   J. Mouly, op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
was only 19 percent lower. This could be expected, since as discussed&#13;
above women predominate in the low and unstructured informal sector of the&#13;
economy. Table 3.5, which gives the distribution of the labor force by&#13;
income, explains the sharp fall in the employment rate when this criterion&#13;
is used. It is obvious from that table that, whereas 52.8 percent of all&#13;
self-employed men earn less than 190 shillings, 76.9 percent of the women&#13;
are in this category. In the wage sector, while 21.8 percent of the men earn&#13;
less than 190 shillings, 42.8 percent of the women do. This indicates that&#13;
the majority of the employed women in Tanzania are not quite fully employed&#13;
and not earning an adequate income.&#13;

Estimates of age-specific labor force participation rates in urban&#13;
Tanzania based on the three estimates of employment are given in Table 3.6.&#13;
The difference between estimates 1 and 3 is more pronounced. Unlike the rural&#13;
areas where the female labor force activity rate is consistently high for all'&#13;
age groups, (80 percent and above), the transition from the rural to the&#13;
urban sector has meant a lower participation rate for Tanzanian women of all&#13;

activity rates for urban females in Kenya in 1969. (See Table 3.7).&#13;

These rates for Tanzania are also lower than those for some other African&#13;
countries. In Ghana, for instance, the employment rates for women in 1960&#13;
and 1970 were 57 and 62 percent, three times those of Tanzania. Admittedly&#13;
the level of economic development of Ghana is higher than that of Tanzania,&#13;
but Tanzania's low rate of female participation in the urban economy cannot&#13;
be explained by level of economic development alone, given that in Tanzania,&#13;
the demand for trained manpower has always been far beyond the available&#13;
supply.&#13;

3.3 Occupational Distribution of Women&#13;
A breakdown of occupational structure by sex will help to indicate&#13;
the employment opportunities available to women in Tanzania, given the level&#13;
of economic development, the conditions of the economy, the educational dis-&#13;
tribution of the labor force, and the existing social and psychological norms.&#13;
The existence of two sectors in the urban labor market of the less developed&#13;
countries has been the subject of considerable discussion in recent economic&#13;
literature. Essentially, the labor market is seen as divided into the formal&#13;
and informal sectors. The difference between these is institutional in that&#13;
wage rates in the formal sector are determined by the Government, whereas this&#13;
is not the case in the informal sector. In Tanzania, 41 percent of the urban&#13;
labor force are in the informal sector. Of this number, 34 percent are women.&#13;
Women are less represented in the formal sector, where they are only 14% of&#13;
the total work force. This compares very favorably with Kenya, where in 1970&#13;
only 14 percent of the women were in wage employment.&#13;
The occupational distribution of adult workers by sex in the formal&#13;
labor market is given in Table 3.8, while that of the workers in the informal&#13;
sector is provided in Table 3.10.&#13;
(a) Occupational Distribution in the Formal Sector&#13;
Given the small number of female wage earners, we have attempted&#13;
to find out if there is evidence in Tanzania of labor market segmentation&#13;
by sex. The index we have adopted is of the type:&#13;

In this index, the proportion of women in the total employed population in&#13;
each sector is used as weight to determine the concentration of women in each&#13;
occupational group. Any occupation with its index greater or equal to unity&#13;
can be designated as a female occupation. Conversely, occupations register-&#13;
ing less than unity can be designated as male occupations. The result of&#13;
this calculation are contained in the last columns of Tables 3.8, 3.9 and&#13;
3.11.&#13;
The results in Table 3.8 show that hotel-waiter-bar-porter, nursing&#13;
and social work, clerical, sales and administrative in the formal sector are&#13;
female occupations. A word of caution about the professional, managerial,&#13;
technical and administrative categories. There are no women managers or tech-&#13;
nical staff. The professional women in this category are mainly teachers and&#13;
educational officers - traditional female occupations. Some occupations are&#13;
predominantly female while others like domestic service are in the process&#13;
of becoming predominantly female.&#13;
The inevitable conclusion is that in Tanzania, labor market segmen-&#13;
tation tends to follow sex lines, as it does in developed countries. Some&#13;
jobs are designated female jobs and women invariably tend to concentrate in&#13;
those jobs. Jobs requiring capital, high educational qualifications or long&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
training periods tend to be predominantly male. Furthermore, in Tanzania,&#13;
it appears that at least in 1971, domestic services had not yet changed&#13;
from predominantly male to predominantly female employment. This may be a&#13;
reflection of the level of development of Tanzania, since in most developing&#13;
countries, the changeover from male to female domestic service augurs the&#13;
transition from the first stage of development to the next stage. 1/&#13;
However, there are occupations where female wage earners are over-&#13;
represented relative to their proportion of the total wage earning population.&#13;
These are hotel-waiter-bar-porter with 37.5 percent females, public services&#13;
with 33.3 percent females, professional with 24.2 percent females, clerical&#13;
with 23.8 percent females and, to some extent, sales with 16.2 percent fe-&#13;
males. For the total wage earning female population, the clerical and un-&#13;
skilled jobs have the highest proportion of total female workers, 17.0 per-&#13;
cent and 15.2 percent respectively. As much as 28.7 percent of female wage&#13;
earners are involved in clerical work. For males, the proportion is lower:&#13;
15.1 percent. In fact, if we combine the "white collar" occupations, the pro-&#13;
fessional, clerical and public service categories, we find that almost half&#13;
of the women, 46.2 percent, who earn wage income are in these types of posi-&#13;
tions. The proportion of males is 22.5 percent, most of whom are in clerical&#13;
positions. A large proportion of male wage earners, 37.1 percent, is found&#13;
in the unskilled, skilled and crafts categories. Although only 4.5% of the&#13;
males are in the hotel-waiter-bar-porter category, 16.5 percent of the females&#13;
are found there.&#13;

How does Tanzania compare with other countries? In Table 3.9 we&#13;
present similar, though more recent and not strictly comparable data for&#13;
urban Kenya. The evidence presented in this table shows that, more so than&#13;
in Tanzania, women tend to be concentrated in certain occupational groups.&#13;
In the formal sector of the urban economy, certain categories of occupations&#13;
can be designated female. These are (a) shop assistants and sales clerks,&#13;
(b) secretarial and related occupations, (c) teaching, and (d) certain pro-&#13;
fessional categories like nursing. In all these, Kenya has higher indices&#13;
of concentration than Tanzania. The Kenyan pattern is very similar to that&#13;
of many developed countries where there is a tendency for women to concentrate&#13;
in female designated occupations. The difference in this respect between&#13;
Kenya and Tanzania may be due to their different levels of development. In&#13;
Tanzania, the situation now may be more similar to Kenya, but, unfortunately,&#13;
there is a lack of more recent data on occupational distribution in Tanzania&#13;
by sex.&#13;
(b) Women in the Informal Sector&#13;
Women are better represented in the nonformal sector of the labor&#13;
market than in the formal sector, partly because most jobs in this sector do&#13;
not require certification. As already indicated, entry into all jobs but&#13;
the most menial in the formal labor market requires the possession of minimum&#13;
educational qualifications. Given women's relatively low levels of education,&#13;
the nonformal labor market with no educational entry requirements is their&#13;
main channel for earning a livelihood in the urban areas.&#13;

earners attended school beyond the first form, as compared to 1.8 percent of&#13;
those in the informal labor market. Table 3.11 presents the occupational&#13;
distribution of the women in the informal sector of the urban Tanzanian&#13;
economy. The scale of enterprise in the informal sector is small and limited&#13;
with simple technology. Within this sector are a number of carpenters, petty&#13;
contractors and traders, tailors, cooks, porters and taxi drivers, many of&#13;
whom perform services for other people or produce goods for sale to the poor&#13;
section of the city. About 53 percent of all the participants in the sector&#13;
are women. Street trading and small plot cultivation appear to be the most&#13;
popular forms of occupation. The rentier class consists primarily of people&#13;
with large Swahili type houses in the suburbs renting out a room or two to&#13;
boarders.&#13;
The hotel and bar category includes self-employed owners of beer&#13;
parlors, or producers of the home brewed variety, as well as barmaids.&#13;
Women are noticeably absent in transport and contracting which require&#13;
initial capital or access to capital. Those in transport are essentially&#13;
owners of taxis or lorries and not drivers of such vehicles. This area&#13;
in Tanzania appears to be firmly male dominated. The contracting group&#13;
contains people who provide short-term services relating to house build-&#13;
ing and road maintenance - masons, roofers, carpenters, electricians and&#13;
plumbers. Since this requires some training and initial capital to obtain&#13;

the necessary tools, it is not surprising that only 1.2 percent of the par-&#13;
ticipants are female. Furthermore, since occupations like electricians,&#13;
carpenters and masons are not usually regarded as female jobs, the women in&#13;
the skilled category are mainly those who have been given permission to supply&#13;
cooked food to Government and industrial establishments. Absence of skills&#13;
and lack of capital can be a barrier to entry into crafts and manufacturing,&#13;
and therefore baking, sewing and brewing are the most popular sources of&#13;
income.&#13;
Given that access to education is more readily available to younger&#13;
people than older men and women, one would expect the concentration of women&#13;
workers in the informal sector to be in the older age groups since these&#13;
groups are the most disadvantaged by lack of educational opportunities. Table&#13;
3.12 gives the age distribution of the workers in the informal sector by sex&#13;
and occupation.&#13;
The highest proportion of participants except for the rentier class&#13;
are within the ages of 24-49, the peak working age group. For both sexes, the&#13;
majority of rentier class are over the age of 50, implying that older people&#13;
who are past the prime working age use property ownership as a form of social&#13;
security.&#13;

3.4 Summary&#13;
This section has demonstrated that although women in urban Tanzania&#13;
make up more than 50% of the working age population, they play a relatively&#13;
insignificant part in the formal labor market. Using the broadest definition&#13;
of employment, we find that only 21.4% of the women are employed in that sub-&#13;
sector. This compares with 88.0% of the men. The majority of the women labor&#13;
force participants are in job situations not very different from that of rural&#13;
women. An examination of the occupational distribution of women in Tanzania&#13;
indicates the beginning of a pattern of concentration of women in few occupa-&#13;
tional categories similar to the pattern existing in the developed countries,&#13;
although this pattern has yet to be solidified as it has been in Kenya. In&#13;
the next section, we will attempt to examine the determinants of female labor&#13;
supply and to offer a possible explanation for women's low involvement in the&#13;
labor force, especially in the modern sector.&#13;

CHAPTER 4&#13;
DETERMINANTS OF FEMALE EMPLOYMENT&#13;
4.1 Introduction&#13;
Economic factors are of basic importance in determining the extent&#13;
of employment opportunities available to both men and women. The national&#13;
economic situation and trend determine the structure and climate within which&#13;
women seek and find work. For the developed countries, many writers have&#13;
emphasized the fact that in periods of chronic unemployment or underemploy-&#13;
ment, women workers are seen as a threat and as intruding on men's domain. 1/&#13;
In the less developed countries, the primary factor is the framework of&#13;
economic development and the government's ability to create new employment&#13;
openings. Where serious unemployment and underemployment exist, there will&#13;
be limited opportunities for women in the modern sector and their activities&#13;
in that sector will be seen as competing with men, even when their earnings&#13;
are essential to the maintenance of their families. Even when government&#13;
policies are not discriminatory, when jobs are limited, the chances of wage&#13;
employment are also limited.&#13;
Many of the characteristics of women that affect their labor market&#13;
activity at any period are the product of past experience and decisions relat-&#13;
ing to marriage, education and fertility. All these decisions are indeed&#13;
affected by the changing milieu in which the women live. In many African&#13;
countries, the economic activities of women in the urban areas strongly reflect&#13;

of the Working Force, Wiley, N.Y., 1951.&#13;
V. Klein, "Industrialization and Changing Roles of Women," Current&#13;
Sociology, 12:1, 1963-64.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
the limitations imposed by poverty and lack of educational opportunities,&#13;
which combine to discourage women from seeking employment in the formal labor&#13;
market. Hence the low rate of employment for women when the conventional&#13;
definition of employment status is used in calculating the employment rate.&#13;
In Tanzania, as in many African countries, the modern sector&#13;
is developing very slowly and offers very few earning opportunities for&#13;
women. For the most part, they are in the sectors requiring little skill&#13;
or training, such as domestic service, and petty trading. Entry into jobs&#13;
in the modern sector requires training and acquisition of skills. Lack&#13;
of educational opportunities and teaching staff, as also family poverty,&#13;
prevent parents from sending all of their children to school. Where there&#13;
is inability to extend education to all children, girls especially suffer.&#13;
In Africa, there are persistent cultural constraints on education of women&#13;
and, therefore, on their employment, which tend to confine their contribution&#13;
to economic life within very narrow limits. These are reinforced by psycho-&#13;
logical factors shaping their image of themselves as workers and also the long&#13;
standing auxiliary character of women's work and traditional social attitude&#13;
dictating their place in the world. ECA, in a 1969 document, attributed the&#13;
low level of female participation in economic activities in East Africa to&#13;
the newness of town life and the fact that society considered it improper&#13;
for a woman to participate in outside employment where she might be under the&#13;
control of some one other than her husband and the fear that such behavior&#13;
on their part would be branded as "loose." Because of lingering traditional&#13;
attitudes concerning the nature of "proper" work for women, women who may&#13;
wish to be economically independent in the urban environment are viewed with&#13;
suspicion by men and are considered sexually loose even when they are highly&#13;

educated and working in professions. 1/ Structural, economic and cultural&#13;
factors all tend to reinforce each other and where there is a negative&#13;
combination, the woman is at a distinct disadvantage. With this in mind,&#13;
we now attempt to isolate the determinants of female participation in modern&#13;
sector employment in Africa.&#13;
4.2       Determinants of Female Employment&#13;
4.2.1     Life Cycle Commitment&#13;
(a) Marriage&#13;
Women have considerable discretion with regard to their labor&#13;
force activity in that, unlike men, their nonparticipation is socially&#13;
acceptable. As already indicated, the majority of women migrants in the&#13;
urban area did not come to the area principally with the intention of&#13;
entering into the formal labor market. The primary reason given by most&#13;
women is to join their husbands. This might presuppose that husbands had&#13;
obtained employment before requesting that their wives join them. The&#13;
decision to participate in the labor force for such women or the decision to&#13;
undertake any type of economic activity either by selling their labor for&#13;
cash or by producing home consumed goods for cash or barter is therefore&#13;
primarily motivated by the need to supplement family income. In the survey,&#13;
only 38.1% of all married women were mainly housewives with no employment,&#13;
18.7% had nonwage employment and 14.9% had wage employment.&#13;
1/   E.S. Nyendwoha, "Uganda:   Women's Role in the Development of Tropical&#13;
and Subtropical Countries," Brussels, Report on the Thirty-first&#13;
meeting of the International Institute of Differing Civilizations,&#13;
1969, p. 178.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

As indicated earlier, until the early 1960s, short-term circular&#13;
migration to the agricultural estates and towns predominated in East Africa.&#13;
The typical pattern was for rural men to leave several times during their&#13;
working lives to take up wage employment. The women usually remained at&#13;
home during the husbands' long absences. The stabilization of the urban&#13;
labor force, a consequence of the increasing demand for skilled labor and&#13;
higher wages altered this pattern. The current tendency is for migrants&#13;
who find urban employment to become residents for the remainder of their&#13;
lives. 1/ For the wives to remain in the rural areas under these cir-&#13;
cumstances would mean complete disruption of family life. The difference&#13;
between men and women in migration motives may also account for the high&#13;
unemployment rate among women. While a man looking for a job would have to&#13;
depend either on friends and family or on marginal employment for short-term&#13;
financial support during the job search, a woman on the other hand, has a&#13;
longer period of financial sustenance from her husband; consequently, unlike&#13;
men, whose option in the event of nonavailability of employment would be to&#13;
return to the rural areas after having exhausted their financial resources,&#13;
women can continue to passively search for employment.&#13;
An attempt by Sabot 2/ to estimate the rate of unemployment based&#13;
on the period of arrival in an urban area indicates that, while the rate of&#13;
unemployment would be expected to be lower for those who arrived in earlier&#13;
years, the rate of decline is considerably more rapid for males than females.&#13;
Between the years prior to 1960 and 1971, the female rate of unemployment&#13;
never fell below 20% whereas that of the males fluctuated between 26% and&#13;

1.2%, the upper limit relating to those who arrived in 1971. This suggests&#13;
that married women would have greater ability to finance extended periods&#13;
of job search than single, divorced or widowed women. The rate of unemploy-&#13;
ment for married women would be higher. Table 4.1 indicates that this is&#13;
indeed so. Some 62% of the married females were unemployed as compared with&#13;
25% of the married men. The group with the lowest rate of unemployment for&#13;
both sexes is the divorced/separated group, which for women especially is&#13;
probably the group least likely to be able to finance extended job search.&#13;
Given that most of the unmarried groups are concentrated between&#13;
the ages of 14-23, it is not surprising that this group has the highest un-&#13;
employment since the older people are less likely, out of pride, to accept&#13;
indefinitely hospitality of relatives or friends, should the period of job&#13;
search become attenuated. On the other hand, it is much easier for a younger&#13;
person or older widowed woman to help out with household chores and errands&#13;
which would tend to legitimize his/her extended stay within the household&#13;
while looking for a job. Table 4.2 gives the unemployment rates by sex and&#13;
age under alternative job search criteria. For men, there is a sharp decline&#13;
in unemployment with age, whereas for females, this is not necessarily so.&#13;
For women, the unmarried group are essentially young females who are still&#13;
dependent on the household or parents, or independent women who have come&#13;
to the urban area in search of jobs. The former are in a similar situation&#13;
to that of married women--hence, the high unemployment among this group.&#13;
Further support for this line of reasoning can be obtained by&#13;
looking at the rate of unemployment by relationship to head of household in&#13;

These female heads of household, for whom the opportunity cost of&#13;
not working is high, make greater efforts to obtain employment than spouses&#13;
and other female members of households.&#13;
(b) Children&#13;
We have argued above that many women are probably not actively&#13;
looking for a job because of the security marriage brings. It is also com-&#13;
monly believed that low female employment rate can be attributed to women's&#13;
life cycle commitments. In most cultures, women have tended within marriage&#13;
to specialize in home activities, whereas the men have specialized in market&#13;
activities. Participation in market activities by a married woman basically&#13;
entails adding another activity to her normal expected function in a way that&#13;
would not threaten the security of her marriage. Marriage is seen as an&#13;
alternative to labor force participation, although this factor may not be&#13;
important in cultures where child care and labor force participation are less&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

mutually incompatible. In some societies, where there is strong role differ-&#13;
entiation within marriage, women would tend to enter the labor force only&#13;
on divorce or widowhood or at the end of their child-bearing period. 1/&#13;
Furthermore, it is to be expected that these women would substitute home&#13;
activities, namely household chores and child-care, for outside activities in&#13;
response to their husband's higher income in the urban environment. Given&#13;
the social attitudes relating to motherhood, the psychic pleasure of caring&#13;
for one's child may far outweigh the benefits from working, especially when&#13;
family income is high.&#13;
In line with this hypothesis, we would expect very low participa-&#13;
tion rates of women in the reproductive years (and the majority of the urban&#13;
women are in the peak reproductive ages). These years correspond to the&#13;
peak labor force participation years for men. The profile of the female&#13;
age-specific participation rates shouid be the reverse of that recorded for&#13;
men. However, in Figure 4.1, there is no difference in the shape of the&#13;
curves between the sexes. It appears that women in urban Tanzania do not&#13;
necessarily withdraw from the labor force during the reproductive years.&#13;
Children may have a positive effect on female employment, as has been ar-&#13;
gued by Boserup and Hirschman. Ester Boserup 2/ and A. Hirschman 3/ have&#13;

argued that the large family size puts pressure on women in LDCs to parti-&#13;
cipate in the labor force to supplement low family income. Neither does&#13;
this necessarily mean that those who are in the labor force would have&#13;
more children than those who are not. In fact, tables 4.4 and 4.5 suggest&#13;
that the reverse may be true for urban Tanzania. For all age groups, except&#13;
35-39, the mean number of children is smaller for the employed. Although&#13;
we cannot conclude from this that there is a negative relationship between&#13;
employment and fertility, since we have not controlled for husband's income&#13;
or ages of children, it is possible that in urban Tanzania this is the&#13;
situation.&#13;

Although existing evidence from many less developed countries&#13;
indicates that there may be some relationship between employment status and&#13;
fertility of women, the relationship has been found not to be invariant&#13;
among countries. An examination of the structure of families indicates&#13;
that, in many countries, what is reflected in the relationship is the type&#13;
of work women do as well as its compatibility with child care, coupled with&#13;
the perceived value of children and the conditions of employment. In urban&#13;
Africa, informal market employment is compatible with child care. Women can&#13;
have their children with them while vending food or fruits in the market.&#13;
Furthermore, a food vendor would not necessarily have to set aside extra&#13;
time for family food preparation since she could meet her family needs by&#13;
increasing the quantity of food that she has prepared for the market. In&#13;
the informal labor market, therefore, there may be no conflict between market&#13;
work and household activities.&#13;
In urban Africa, it is only in the modern sector that a woman is&#13;
faced with choices between mutually exclusive situations, since the work&#13;
place is usually separated from home and the presence of children is not&#13;
permitted at the work place. Besides, formal sector work requires attend-&#13;
ance at fixed periods during the day and inability to keep to such rigid&#13;
time frames is usually penalized by loss of earnings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Table 4.6 shows that the mean number of children for women who&#13;
work in the modern sector is less than that of women who are in self employ-&#13;
ment (non-wage earners). Within occupational groups, however, it is notice-&#13;
able that the professional, technical and administrative group have higher&#13;
mean number of children than all other groups except people in crafts, etc.&#13;
This may be a reflection of the ability of this class to purchase surrogate&#13;
care for their children and it may also reflect the effect of income on&#13;
fertility in that this class may perceive themselves as able to afford the&#13;
associated cost of large families. However, the data in this table are to&#13;
be interpreted with caution, since variations in fertility due to age have&#13;
not been taken into consideration.&#13;
Clearly, the presence of children might be a determinant of female&#13;
employment status. Whether it has a positive or a negative effect will de-&#13;
pend on the family circumstances, the type of work and the availability of&#13;
surrogate care.&#13;
4.2.2 Education and Work Experience&#13;
Although empirical evidence from very many countries indicates a&#13;
strong correlation between education and earnings, both variables have been&#13;
found to exert independent effects on female labor force participation. Dif-&#13;
ferentials in earnings of persons of different levels of education can be&#13;
attributed to education itself. 1/ Education induces women to seek employ-&#13;
ment by increasing (a) the desire to work, (b) the probability of getting&#13;
employed, especially in a labor market with high unemployment as is the case&#13;
in many African countries, (c) increasing their productivity in the labor&#13;
market more than in the home and, (d) raising the opportunity cost of not&#13;
working.&#13;

In Africa, given that access to most jobs in the modern sector is&#13;
open only to those who have some certification from the formal educational&#13;
system, educational attainment is closely correlated with modern sector&#13;
employment. In developed countries, however, the relationship between edu-&#13;
cation and female labor force participation is not invariant. For the U.S.,&#13;
studies 1/ show that by holding age, color, and income constant, differences&#13;
in participation rates for white wives associated with their educational&#13;
attainment vanishes if one of the children is below school age. Hence the&#13;
conclusion that educated wives in developed countries are influenced in their&#13;
decisions relating to participation in the labor force by demands imposed by&#13;
child care. Empirical studies 2/ in Latin America and some Asian countries&#13;
show, however, that there is a positive relationship between educational&#13;
attainment and labor force participation. In Africa, there is a positive&#13;
relationship between education and female employment. For most parents,&#13;
education is an investment in the child, from which they expect a stream of&#13;
benefits. Lacking social security, they are insuring against any future re-&#13;
duction in earning power. Consequently, regardless of sex, the more human&#13;
capital investment embodied in a person, the more actively that person would&#13;
be expected to participate in the labor force.&#13;
Empirical results from developed countries show that there is a&#13;
strong negative correlation between unemployment rates and educational levels&#13;

of workers since, as expected, workers who are at a disadvantage with regard&#13;

finding appropriate work. In Africa, however, this may not necessarily hold.&#13;

Table 4.7 indicates that the situation in urban Tanzania is one of positive&#13;
relationship between educational level and unemployment until the second&#13;
level, when the rate falls sharply. Table 4.8 indicates that similar influ-&#13;
ence as in Tanzania operated in Kenya. Here, too, if we discount the distor-&#13;
tions due to small sample size, we see that there is a positive relationship&#13;
between education and unemployment rate. One reason for this is that in&#13;
Africa, there is a positive relationship between rural/urban income differen-&#13;
tials and educational levels, and additional years in school are associated&#13;

associated with greater increments to urban than to rural income. 1/ The&#13;
differences between employment growth rates of workers with no education&#13;
and those with lower level of education widened because of the sharp expan-&#13;
sion of opportunities for primary education in the years before and after&#13;
independence. Furthermore, there was a sharp increase in the demand for&#13;
workers in the sectors where minimal educational was required.&#13;
In the empirical analysis of migrant behavior, Sabot and Barnum&#13;
demonstrated "the educational selectivity of the migration process and the&#13;
fact that differences in psychic cost of moving for the educated and the&#13;
uneducated reinforce differences in real economic opportunities, generating&#13;
higher unemployment rates among primary school leavers in the urban areas&#13;
than among the educated." 2/ This explanation is the most feasible one for&#13;
the differential in employment opportunities between the primary school&#13;
leavers and the uneducated category. This reason does not, however, account&#13;
for the lower rate of unemployment among secondary school leavers and the&#13;
group above them. Tanzania in the immediate post-independence period did&#13;
not allow the rapid expansion of educational opportunities at the higher&#13;
levels of education to transform scarcity of high level manpower into a&#13;
surplus. This was accomplished by a manpower planning policy which matched&#13;
the number of available upper level school places to forecasts pertaining to&#13;
demand for high level manpower based on official surveys. This policy&#13;
ensured that a student who was assured of a place in the upper educational&#13;

strata would have employment at the end of his/her school year. In this&#13;
respect, the Tanzania experience is different from the experience of other&#13;
African countries where there has been a tremendous expansion of secondary&#13;
school education without any consideration regarding the manpower requirements&#13;
of the country. In these countries, unemployment of school leavers can be&#13;
attributed to lack of manpower planning, as well as inability of the economy&#13;
to generate employment.&#13;
Sex differentials in the aggregate employment rate can be explained&#13;
by differences in human capital formation between the sexes since 92% of the&#13;
adult urban women in Tanzania do not have post primary education and 53% do&#13;
not have any formal education. But this is not the only explanation, since,&#13;
as indicated in Table 4.9, with educational level constant, there still&#13;
persist high differentials in participation rates, indicating that factors&#13;
other than education may account for the differences in employment rate&#13;
between the sexes.&#13;

A further explanation of the low female employment is their compara-&#13;
tively shorter job experience than men. Since women are relatively new to&#13;
the urban economy, they are invariably disqualified from jobs requiring ex-&#13;
perience. Furthermore, the available unskilled jobs in construction or rail-&#13;
ways are usually jobs requiring physical strength for which most women by&#13;
nature are not equipped.&#13;

Acquisition of job experience reduced the gap between men and women's&#13;
unemployment rate from 26 percentage points to 10 (Table 4.10). This relation-&#13;
ship is maintained even when education is held constant.&#13;
The discussion in this section identified the following determinants&#13;
of female employment status. Apart from constraints arising out of the&#13;
general economic situation in the country, a woman's marital status and the&#13;
nature of her dependence on her husband is an important determinant. The&#13;
second important factor is her fertility status. The presence of children&#13;
may have a negative or a positive effect on labor force participation and&#13;
which prevails depends on the woman's economic and family situation. Finally,&#13;
although the level of education has been found to give impetus to a woman's&#13;
determination to join the labor force, this by itself cannot ensure that she&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
will be admitted to the labor force. However, her chance of being employed&#13;
is greatly improved by the nature and length of job experience she has to&#13;
offer, especially in a situation where the economy is not generating employ-&#13;
ment to absorb all the output of education institutions.&#13;
We shall now attempt to estimate the labor supply function for&#13;
women in Tanzania with a view to ascertaining which factors have the most&#13;
important effect on their employment.&#13;
4.3 The Model and Empirical Estimation of the Labor Supply&#13;
Our main interest here is to determine the effect of certain eco-&#13;
nomic and demographic factors on the amount of time a woman spends in the&#13;
labor force in Tanzania. An important contribution of this section is that&#13;
it attempts to extend the analysis for developed countries to Africa. We&#13;
begin by presenting the basic model of labor supply based on the individual&#13;
utility maximization and discussing the conceptual issues arising from it&#13;
when applied to the African urban market. The empirical model for this&#13;
study is presented and the choice of the variables discussed. The results&#13;
of analysis are then presented and discussed.&#13;
Participation in the labor force involves a decision by the indi-&#13;
vidual on how to allocate his/her time and a decision on the part of the&#13;
employer to offer the individual a job. It is this interaction of supply&#13;
and demand that determines whether or not a person participates in the labor&#13;
force. In empirical estimation of labor supply, it is not always possible&#13;
to specify the demand schedule, especially when the analysis is confined to&#13;
the household level because information on labor demand variables is usually&#13;
lacking. On a macro-level, with aggregate data from a well defined labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
market, the average wage rate facing the individual worker is observable&#13;
and is exogenous to the potential worker, whereas when the data are at a&#13;
disaggregated level, there is usually no information available on the labor&#13;
market and, therefore, no information on the wage rate facing the individual&#13;
worker. Given this, therefore, it is normal to restrict the analysis to the&#13;
supply conditions, as we do here.&#13;
The labor force status equation estimated below is derived from a&#13;
simple model of individual behavior in which the individual is assumed to&#13;
maximize his/her utility subject to an income constraint. The individual&#13;
utility function proposed is simple and contains only two arguments: the&#13;
individual's leisure time, L, and the amount of composite goods G consumed.&#13;
Ignoring the tax rate on income and goods, and making the assumption that the&#13;
wage rate is exogenous, the microeconomic problem faced by the individual is&#13;
to maximize the following utility function U(L, G), subject to the following&#13;
constraint: (T - L)w + y - PG = 0&#13;
where w = hourly or monthly wage rate.&#13;
y = unearned income: the income flow that would accrue if the&#13;
individual does not work at all.&#13;
P = the price of G.&#13;
T = length of time period. Since&#13;
L = T - H where H = number of hours in the labor market.&#13;
The use of an individual utility function in the estimation of the&#13;
labor supply function of a woman is not the standard acceptable procedure.&#13;
The accepted framework is to estimate the labor supply function within the&#13;
family utility maximizing framework. The argument is that the individual's&#13;
use of time between market and non-market activity can best be understood&#13;
within the context of the family, since there is interdependence of needs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
within the family. Within this framework, the amount of time a woman de-&#13;
votes to market work is viewed as being dependent on the effective wage&#13;
of the spouse as well as the non-labor income of the family. The assumption&#13;
here is that men's work consists exclusively of paid time in the market and&#13;
a large portion of a woman's time is devoted to unpaid non-market work which&#13;
even though it commands no monetary price is still of immense economic value&#13;
to the family. Mincer 1/ has argued that although family income (i.e., total&#13;
income by all family members - husbands and wife included) should affect the&#13;
total amount of time devoted to work by a woman, either at home or in the&#13;
market, it is the relative productivity of home and market work which should&#13;
determine how a woman should spend her time. In this study we have not used&#13;
family income as a determinant of a woman's time allocation between home and&#13;
market work because the concept is inappropriate for Africa. Our reasons&#13;
are that the arrangements within the African household and the structure of&#13;
African families impose on the woman the necessity to have an independent&#13;
source of income to meet her share of household expenditures. 2/&#13;

Traditionally, the African wife is not wholly supported by her&#13;
husband as in Western societies. In the rural areas, she can meet those&#13;
obligatory expenses by selling a portion of the produce of the farm which is&#13;
within her control, in the urban areas where traditional forms of occupation&#13;
are not readily available, she has to create other sources of income so as to&#13;
meet these traditional obligations. The nature of the decision therefore for&#13;
the Tanzanian urban women is not whether or not to work but what will repre-&#13;
sent the minimum period for which she would offer her labor to meet her tradi-&#13;
tional obligations. Within this context, therefore, the family utility maximi-&#13;
zation framework is inappropriate. The most suitable framework therefore is&#13;
the individual utility maximization framework. Utility functions which embody&#13;
personal preferences for leisure will be different for different female indi-&#13;
viduals. The dimensions for these differences can be identified and included&#13;
in the labor supply function. In the empirical work below, we include var-&#13;
iables indicating the presence of dependents n; the marital status m, number&#13;
of years of schooling s, number of years in the urban area k, household status&#13;
h. Finally, there are other variables which we cannot quantify or identify.&#13;
These variables are included in the error term, yielding the following:&#13;
L = L(w, Y, P, k, n, b, m, s, X, E)&#13;
There are several processes between this general specification and the final&#13;
equation estimated below. First, the dependent variable L is estimated as a&#13;
dichotomous variable indicating labor force status (LFS). Secondly, since&#13;
it is not possible to deflate financial variables in a satisfactory way even&#13;
when the data are available (in this case, they are not), we ignore P. Third,&#13;
Y, the individual's unearned income, which in our specification should include&#13;
the portion of income derived from the husband, is not included in this&#13;
analysis because of lack of data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
With this adjustment, the general functional form would yield a linear specifi-&#13;
cation of the following type:&#13;
Lfs  = a + awi + a2ki + a3ni + a4bi +       a5mi +a5i +abxi +Ei&#13;
Given the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable, this specification&#13;
is further refined as follows:   Since LFsi indicates labor force status&#13;
(with 1 denoting labor force participation and 0 denoting the opposite status)&#13;
the predicted value Lfsi for the individual woman is best viewed as the prob-&#13;
ability that such ,a person will be in the labor force. The coefficients will&#13;
denote the changes in this condition associated with the changes in explana-&#13;
tory variables. A major concern therefore is that probabilities are logically&#13;
bounded by 0 and 1, but the predicted values of the LFsi from the regressions&#13;
are not. The problem is resolved by use of the logit method of estimation.&#13;
This model is a useful method for estimating equations when there is a quali-&#13;
tative dependent variable.&#13;
4.3.1. Hypothesized Relationships&#13;
Education (S): Following from our discussion in Section 4.2, we&#13;
expect a positive relationship between years of schooling and the dependent&#13;
variable.&#13;
Length of stay in urban residence (k): This variable should have a&#13;
positive relationship with the dependent variable since, as has been demon-&#13;
strated elsewhere, 1/ the probability of obtaining employment increases with&#13;
the length of stay, because given time individuals gain experience in the&#13;
nuances of urban job hunting procedures. Table 4.11 demonstrates that while&#13;
women who arrived in 1970 had a 28 percent unemployment rate, only 10 percent&#13;

of the 1951-60 group were still unemployed. For men, 40 percent of those who&#13;
arrived in the year of the survey were unemployed while only 5 percent of the&#13;

Experience (X): The expected relationship is positive since those&#13;
with previous job experience are most easily absorbed because employers would&#13;
not incur any substantial extra training expenditure.&#13;
Household status (h): This variable is a dummy variable of the form&#13;
1 if head of household and 0 if not. Given the low unemployment rate of&#13;
female heads of household (Table 4.12), we expect that this variable will be&#13;
positively related to our dependent variable.&#13;

Marital status (m):  Conversely, we expect that marital status (m)&#13;
(a dichotomous variable with value 1 for married and 0 for single, widowed&#13;
and divorced) to be negatively related to Lfsi&#13;
Number of dependents (n): It is not expected that number of&#13;
children will significantly affect the labor force status of urban Tanzanian&#13;
women, given their present occupational distribution. As already indicated,&#13;
many of the women are in a job situation which enables them to combine child&#13;
care with outside economic pursuits. Furthermore, given the present stage of&#13;
economic development in Tanzania, those few women in the modern sector can&#13;
afford surrogate care.&#13;
Earned labor income (w): Participants in the survey were asked to&#13;
indicate their income from labor per month. In order to arrive at their&#13;
hourly wage rate, we have divided the monthly income from labor by the product&#13;
of the given number of hours worked per day and the estimated number of days&#13;
worked per month. This is the income variable used in our regression equa-&#13;
tion. The hypothesized relationship with the dependent variable is positive.&#13;

4.3.2     Description of the Results&#13;
Table 4.14 contains the results of the empirical estimation of&#13;
the labor supply equation. Two equations were estimated. The first contains&#13;
all persons who have at one point in time been in the labor force, whether in&#13;
the formal or in the informal labor market. The second equation was restricted&#13;
to those persons who ever worked in the formal sector of the labor market.&#13;
The statistical results suggest that the expected income from labor is the&#13;
most important influence on whether or not a person is in the formal labor&#13;
market.&#13;
Contrary to our hypothesis, in the first equation, education was&#13;
not significant, perhaps because the large number of women in the nonformal&#13;
sector with no education had distorted the results. The regression equation&#13;
presented in Table 4.15 shows that education does significantly increase the&#13;
probability of a woman obtaining employment in the formal sector, given that&#13;
she participates in the labor force. Education was, however, significant in&#13;
the second equation in Table 4.14 when length of job experience was included.&#13;
This suggests that even though education may provide a woman with incentive&#13;
to participate in the labor market, education by itself may not necessarily&#13;
ensure that she is employed. As table 4.10 indicated, previous job experience&#13;
is an important determinant of whether or not a women who is looking for&#13;
employment is given the opportunity to participate in the labor force. The&#13;
statistical results of equation 2a confirm the importance of job experience.&#13;
Inclusion of the experience variable raised the significance of education&#13;
considerably. One reason why this may be so is because the decision to&#13;
employ a person is made by the employer and depends on his/her perception&#13;
of the type of worker he requires. Given the choice between two women with&#13;

identical qualifications, he would invariably choose the one who has previous&#13;
experience. If the choice is between a man and a woman, other factors may&#13;
enter into his preference function. For example, he may give preference to a&#13;
man over a woman even if the woman has previous job experience simply because&#13;
he may feel that he cannot depend on the woman to stay on the job for any&#13;
length of time. In Africa, it is not unusual for employers of even domestic&#13;
servants to prefer men over women.&#13;
As expected, household status is also positively related to female&#13;
employment. Women who are heads of household have a greater incentive to&#13;
participate in the labor force than women who are not heads of household since&#13;
they have to bear the financial responsibility of the household. Female heads&#13;
of household make a more determined effort to obtain employment whether or&#13;
not they are new immigrants or seasoned city dwellers. The negative associa-&#13;
tion between marital status and the dependent variable is to be expected. The&#13;
results reinforce the argument presented earlier that married women are more&#13;
able than these women who are heads of household to finance longer job search&#13;
because of the economic security that marriage provides. Marital status may&#13;
be one reason for the low level of female employment in the labor force in&#13;
Tanzania.&#13;
Contrary to our hypothesis, the number of years in the city is&#13;
negatively correlated with the dependent variable, as is the number of&#13;
children, although this is not significant as was hypothesized. One reason&#13;
why this may be so is that obtaining a job does not so much depend on how many&#13;
years one has lived in the city as on one's access to information pertaining&#13;
to employment prospects. Some women may be unwilling to risk rejection unless&#13;
they are absolutely sure of a favorable outcome and consequently they may tend&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
to depend on a network of friends and relatives for information on what jobs&#13;
they are likely to get. New arrivals may make more use of this method and&#13;
therefore have easier access to available jobs than old residents. Conse-&#13;
quently, the sign of this variable may only be reflecting this possibility.&#13;
4.4 Summary&#13;
In the estimation of the empirical model of the determinants of&#13;
female labor supply, the results indicate that entry into the formal (wage)&#13;
market for women is largely determined by the expected income, education and&#13;
the type of responsibility the woman has in the household. If a woman is&#13;
the head of household, she will of course make a greater effort to enter into&#13;
the labor market so as to support her dependents. Although education is&#13;
important, its importance in facilitating access to the labor market depends&#13;
on the employer's preference and the past job experience of the woman who is&#13;
looking for employment. The empirical results reinforce the major points we&#13;
have made in the preceding sections. In the next section, we will consider&#13;
the determinants of earnings from labor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER 5&#13;
DETERMINANTS OF EARNINGS&#13;
5.1 Introduction&#13;
The previous section has demonstrated that despite women's&#13;
numerical importance in the urban economy, in urban Africa they are most&#13;
likely to suffer high unemployment and most likely to be in low income&#13;
occupations. In urban Tanzania, 47 percent of the self-employed women&#13;
and 13.5 percent of the women wage earners (compared with 4% of the men)&#13;
in 1971 had labor incomes of not more than 100 shillings. The ILO study&#13;
of Kenya found that in 1970, 40.7 percent of employed female heads of house-&#13;
hold, compared to 13.8 percent of male heads of household, in Nairobi had&#13;
incomes of not more than 199 shillings. 1/ Since female heads of households&#13;
constitute the largest group of employed female workers, the inference that&#13;
the majority of them are in the income group below the poverty level is&#13;
inescapable. In this section we explore the determinants of earnings and&#13;
attempt to offer some explanation for the high concentration of urban women&#13;
in low income jobs. The question in this context is whether rewards from&#13;
continuous labor market exposure differ between men and women in Africa.&#13;
Within the human capital framework, an acceptable explanation for&#13;
labor income is to regard earnings as a function of education and experience&#13;
and to treat any differences not explained by these two variables as arising&#13;
from institutional factors. For example, the existence of the two distinct&#13;
labor markets in urban Africa enables us to explain any residual differentials&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

in earnings between two workers of the same quality. It offers an explana-&#13;
tion for any existing differences in earnings between a welder in the formal&#13;
sector of the economy and an equally qualified one in the informal sector.&#13;
Explanation for informal sector labor income is much more com-&#13;
plicated since it depends among other things on the amount of capital one&#13;
has to invest in the business. In all African countries, access to capital&#13;
is important if one expects to derive high rewards from non-agricultural&#13;
self-employment. The amount of capital will of course depend on the busi-&#13;
ness one is interested in. Very few individuals of either sex can finance&#13;
large scale operations, but there are businesses like street trading, hotel-&#13;
bar and small-scale cultivation which require low initial working capital.&#13;
Table 5.1 indicates that the popularity of street trading and bar keeping for&#13;
urban Tanzanian women is because of low initial working capital. As indicated&#13;
earlier women predominate in small-scale cultivation (Shamba). Although the&#13;
initial capital for this activity is fairly high compared with investment in&#13;
street trading, it would appear that since the benefit from it in terms of&#13;
subsistence existence is perceived to be for the whole family, wives have&#13;
little difficulty raising the initial sum required to purchase or rent the&#13;
necessary space for food cultivation. Lack of capital is another reason why&#13;
women are not owners of transport facilities or larger shops.&#13;
5.2 Education, Experience and Earnings&#13;
Clearly, variations exist between individuals in their stock of&#13;
human capital. Workers differ in the amount of formal schooling and job-&#13;
related training completed, the type of informal on-the-job training obtained&#13;
and the amount of skills embodied in them. Those people who invest heavily in&#13;
skill acquisition obtain commensurate rewards in the form of higher earnings.&#13;

Women generally are said to earn less than men, because over the life cycle,&#13;
they tend to invest less in skills and human capital since (a) they have&#13;
shorter life time commitments to work than men, and (b) they have weaker&#13;
incentives to augment job skills over the life cycle. Within this framework,&#13;
married women would on the whole have a lower earnings profile than single&#13;
women because of their lower effective human capital. Furthermore, because&#13;
of the discontinuities in their life cycle work profile, their skills tend&#13;
to deteriorate at a faster pace than those of men and/or single women. In&#13;
urban Africa, education is the most important means of acquiring marketable&#13;
skills. Positions of responsibility in the government and in business are&#13;
not open to the uneducated, whether men or women.&#13;
Table 5.2 gives the estimated mean years of schooling for wage&#13;
earners and those in self employment for the Tanzanian sampled population.&#13;
This table indicates that for both men and women, monthly wage-income and&#13;
estimated income for people in the informal labor market rises with the&#13;
number of years of schooling. In the formal labor market, at higher income&#13;
levels, women tended on the average to have more schooling than men--9.2&#13;
years of schooling for the income level 301-600 shillings as against 6.2&#13;
years for men. In the informal labor market, women invariably have lower&#13;
levels of education. The same is true when age is held constant, as in&#13;
Table 5.3. Within the 36-44 age group, exposure to the second level of&#13;
education is associated with almost a threefold increase in the average&#13;
earnings of participants--confirming for Tanzania the positive association&#13;
between level of education and earnings evident in industrialized countries.&#13;

Rewards for investment in human capital are distributed in all&#13;
African countries, including Tanzania, in accordance with the amount of&#13;
investment made. Those who are in the high income bracket like managers,&#13;
professional and semi-professional persons have invariably on the average&#13;
invested more than ten years in formal education, whereas those in the lower&#13;
income earning activities - street trading, domestic service, managers -&#13;
have as indicated in Table 5.5 invested very little in improving their human&#13;
capital. Even within the informal sector, education appears to be correlated&#13;
with income. Table 5.6 indicates that as the level of education rises, so do&#13;
the average earnings derived from occupation at least for women.&#13;
Because women in Africa have generally invested less on training&#13;
than men, they invariably reap smaller rewards. Those few women who have&#13;
entered high income occupations such as nursing, teaching, and social work,&#13;

have also invested time in acquisition of the required skills. These occupa-&#13;
tions require long training periods and, comparatively, very few women are&#13;
willing to invest in them either because of social pressure or because their&#13;
parents are unwilling or unable to support them.&#13;
Skill differences in occupations also give rise to differences in&#13;
earnings attached to occupations. Where a certain level of skill is required&#13;
to perform certain functions one would expect the dexterity in performing such&#13;
functions and knowledge of particular market conditions for such skills to be&#13;
acquired by experience. As one becomes specialized, this will be reflected in&#13;
high earnings. This appears to be demonstrated by Figure 5.1. For both men&#13;
and women, experience on the job appears to affect the earnings from that job.&#13;
However, it also appears from Figure 5.1 that after a certain age, human&#13;
capital depreciates and there is no relationship between experience and&#13;
income. For the secondary school group, the peak appears to be attained after&#13;
ten years of work experience. Figure 5.1 also indicates the strong positive&#13;

relationship between education and earnings. However, the effect of skills,&#13;
as well as life time experience on earnings, will depend on the type of&#13;
occupation entered by the individual concerned and the amount of training&#13;
required in that occupation. In urban Africa, access to informal occupa-&#13;
tions, like trading, farming, bartending does not require too much training.&#13;
Consequently, one should be able to go in and out of such occupations without&#13;
loss of earning power because the skills required do not deteriorate at the&#13;
same rate as the skills required for higher status jobs such as nursing,&#13;
teaching and administrative-clerical jobs. Consequently, the differentials in&#13;
earnings between men and women in the same occupation would apply differently&#13;
to two women who are of the same age and who are returning to the labor market&#13;
after a period of absence and would depend on the occupation each chose to&#13;
enter and the type of skill required by that job. For example, it should be&#13;
possible for a nursemaid to earn the same as a man in the same situation, all&#13;
things being equal, within a relatively short period, since very little time&#13;
is required for retraining. A social worker, however, may have to invest much&#13;
more in retraining. Consequently, the differential between her earnings and&#13;
others who have given continuous service in the labor market would reflect&#13;
(a) the deterioration of her skills due to lack of use and (b) the duration&#13;
of the retraining program necessary to upgrade her skills. This analysis&#13;
suggests the need to classify occupations where possible by level of skills&#13;
required of participants.&#13;
In this section we have discussed some of the reasons for differ-&#13;
entials in earnings between men and women in the urban labor market in&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa. The important points highlighted are the low level of&#13;
human capital and skills which are essential for high-level jobs with high&#13;

remuneration. The preponderance of women in the informal sector of the&#13;
urban labor market can be explained by the fact that entry into such jobs&#13;
does not require educational attainment. However, even in this sector,&#13;
because they generally lack capital, women are restricted to those jobs&#13;
requiring very little capital outlay. Below, we shall attempt to present&#13;
and estimate empirically the earnings function. The objective of this&#13;
exercise will be to find out whether there are sex differences in earnings&#13;
of men and women in the Tanzania urban labor market and, if so, to offer&#13;
some explanation for it.&#13;
5.3 The Estimation of the Determinants of Earnings&#13;
5.3.1 Empirical Model&#13;
The basic equation of the earnings function used is as follows:&#13;
e = f (s,m),  e   hourly earnings&#13;
s = vector of human capital embodied in the individual&#13;
m - institutional factors which may affect the earnings of the&#13;
individual -- in this case, the number of years in urban residence.&#13;
We had considered including an institutional variable which would take into&#13;
account the existence of two separate labor markets -- the formal and&#13;
informal -- but experimental runs showed that this variable was distorting&#13;
the results of the regression analysis. Consequently, separate runs were&#13;
made for those in the formal labor market. The empirical model tested for&#13;
the earnings function is as follows:&#13;
ln(e) = f (s, s2, Ex, Ex2, m, x)&#13;
Where ln (e) = natural log of hourly earnings&#13;
s = length of school experience&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
Ex = length of work experience&#13;
m = number of years of urban residence&#13;
and x = dummy variable taking the value of I when the&#13;
person is male and 0 when female.&#13;
The procedure we have adopted is as follows. The first set of regressions&#13;
was restricted to those in the formal labor market. Three sets of regressions&#13;
were tested--(a) males only, (b) females only (c) pooled male/female data. In&#13;
this case, the sex variable was included in the regression equation whereas in&#13;
the others, it was omitted. Our reason for having separate male/female runs&#13;
was to enable us to compare the differential effects of the independent vari-&#13;
ables on the earnings of both sexes. In the third set of regressions we hoped&#13;
that, by including sex as a variable in the regression, it would be possible&#13;
to ascertain whether there is sex discrimination in the formal labor market.&#13;
No regression of earnings function on those in the informal labor&#13;
market was done because we do not expect education or experience to be corre-&#13;
lated with earnings there. Furthermore, it is conceptually difficult to&#13;
determine from answers given by respondents what really is labor income and&#13;
what is working capital in the informal sector.&#13;
Finally, we have attempted to isolate the effects of education on&#13;
earnings by estimating separate equations for illiterate workers, that is&#13;
those who have never gone to school. The mean and standard deviation for&#13;
each of the variables in each of the regressions are given in Table 5.7.&#13;

5.3.2 Results of Analysis&#13;
As mentioned above, a way of comparing the rewards received by&#13;
men and women from the labor market would be to run separate regressions&#13;
for each sex and to compare the size of the coefficients. Ideally, this&#13;
method is useful when the earnings of men and women in the same occupational&#13;
group are being compared. The smallness of the sample for each occupation&#13;
made this unfeasible in the present case. However, without it, meaningful&#13;
results have been.obtained. Table 5.8 contains the results of the regression&#13;
analyses. These (regressions 1 and 2) indicate that women obtain compara-&#13;
tively higher labor market rewards than men from longer stay in school, more&#13;
years in the city and job experience. For each of these variables the size&#13;
of the coefficient for the female sample is larger than that of the men.&#13;
An interesting point to emerge from these results is the lack of&#13;
significance of the sex variable in regression 3. This indicates that, at&#13;
least in Tanzania, there is no sex discrimination in the job market when the&#13;
number of years of schooling is controlled for. This finding is important&#13;
since it reinforces our central thesis, which will be presented below, that&#13;
in many African countries, sex discrimination in employment occurs primarily&#13;
through differential educational opportunities, as has been the case in&#13;
developed countries. Experience is also positively related to earnings as&#13;
we expected. An important step to gaining experience is to obtain a job and&#13;
when one is denied that opportunity because of lack of education which is a&#13;
prerequisite, one also lacks the opportunity to gain the experience and is&#13;
unfortunately relegated to a lower status.&#13;
The negative sign of experience squared is also as expected.&#13;
Figure 5.1 indicates that for those with secondary and post primary education,&#13;

after a certain period, the relationship between earnings and years of&#13;
experience is negative, indicating a curvilinear relationship between years&#13;
of job experience and earnings.&#13;
For the illiterate group (regression 4) there is a positive rela-&#13;
tionship between experience and earnings. The magnitude of the coefficient of&#13;
the experience variable indicates that on-the-job experience exerts a greater&#13;
effect on the earnings of non-educated workers than on those of the educated&#13;
group. Furthermore, its effect on the earning potential is much larger than&#13;
on the earnings of the educated class. Among the illiterate group, sex has&#13;
an important effect on earnings. The magnitude of the sex variable and its&#13;
significance in this equation compared with regression 3 seems to indicate&#13;
that illiterate women suffer more sex discrimination in employment than their&#13;
educated counterparts. Furthermore, the positive relationship between sex&#13;
and earnings in this category might also be reflecting the limited employment&#13;
opportunities open to the uneducated African woman. Whereas an uneducated man&#13;
can generally obtain employment as a day laborer, garden boy, load carrier,&#13;
work on construction sites requiring physical strength, a woman by virtue of&#13;
her sex is prevented from obtaining income from those sources.&#13;
5.4 Possible Explanation of Sex Differences in Earnings and Labor&#13;
Market Involvement in Africa&#13;
5.4.1     Review of Existing Literature&#13;
The foregoing analysis indicates that insofar as the available&#13;
data show, there is no sex discrimination in the urban labor market. In this&#13;
section we attempt to offer same plausible explanation for the observed sex&#13;
differences in labor earnings and employment in Africa. Traditionally,&#13;
economists explained differences in individuals' labor market performance in&#13;
terms of productivity. The theory in its original form postulated that, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
competitive equilibrium, earnings in the labor market would tend to equal&#13;
the marginal productivity of labor. The newer variant of this theory--the&#13;
theory of human capital--evolved to explain not only the distribution of&#13;
earnings between the various factors of production--capital and labor--but&#13;
the distribution of earnings within the labor sector itself. According to&#13;
this version 1/ a worker's wage can be viewed as a return on the amount of&#13;
capital invested in his training.&#13;
This framework emphasizes that outlays on formal education and the firms'&#13;
investment in on-the-job training are analytically comparable. The low&#13;
productivity of any worker implies that either the individual or society has&#13;
decided that the returns to investment in terms of productivity would be too&#13;
low to warrant expenditure on increasing the amount and quality of human&#13;
capital. If jobs do not provide training, the theory assumes that employers,&#13;
given prevailing economic circumstances, do not find it profitable to invest&#13;
in workers' training. Since training is a form of investment undertaken in&#13;
response to future earning prospects, sex differences in costs of and returns&#13;
to such investment can be attributed to inability of female workers themselves&#13;
or their employers to undertake such investment. Furthermore, regardless of a&#13;
specific individual's plans, employers may have preconceived notions as to the&#13;
high turnover of women workers and may tend to regard investment in women&#13;
workers as less profitable than that of men since they expect that women may&#13;
not work long enough for the returns on the investment to be realized.&#13;
Employers' expectations in this case are critical; since women are expected to&#13;
leave the labor force at some period in their life cycle, some employers may&#13;
be unwilling to employ them because of this.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
This framework has been criticized as irrelevant to the position&#13;
of women in developed countries. It has been argued that the pure human&#13;
capital approach does not offer a sufficient explanation for exclusion of&#13;
women from certain occupations unless one posits an extreme distribution of&#13;
employers' tastes to obtain the extreme outcome of segregation. 1/ However,&#13;
in urban Africa there is no evidence that qualified women have been forced&#13;
to take up positions in predominantly female occupations or that they have&#13;
been excluded from male occupations.&#13;
The institutional approach to occupational and wage differences&#13;
between men and women is exemplified in a theory which states that the role&#13;
of employment and manpower utilization in perpetuation of poverty is best&#13;
understood in terms of the dual labor market. This has been offered as an&#13;
alternative approach to the problems confronting women in the labor market.&#13;
One sector of the market--the primary market--offers jobs which have high&#13;
wages, good working conditions, employment and job stability and chances of&#13;
advancement; the other sector--the secondary market--has jobs which are, by&#13;
comparison with the primary job market, unattractive. Piore 2/ (1971) sug-&#13;
gests that an important aspect of the differences between the two sectors&#13;
appears to be behavioral requirements imposed on the work force, particularly&#13;
that of employment stability. The behavioral traits associated with the&#13;
secondary market are reinforced by the process of working in secondary jobs&#13;

and living among those whose life style is accommodated to that type of&#13;
employment. A worker forced into the secondary market would tend over&#13;
time to develop the traits which are predominant among such workers. Inter-&#13;
sectoral immobility, especially from secondary to primary labor markets,&#13;
is not necessarily due to the lack of skills by such workers, but to the&#13;
unreliability and intermittence of their work effort. Moreover, some workers&#13;
who do possess the behavioral traits associated with the primary sector are&#13;
trapped into the secondary market because of their superficial resemblance&#13;
to secondary workers. 1/ This theory emphasizes that the cumulative impact&#13;
of a wide variety of institutional inequalities and discriminatory practices&#13;
is an effective stratification of the labor market which resists competitive&#13;
forces and individual decisions.&#13;
Although this analysis was developed specifically to explain labor&#13;
market experience of disadvantaged workers in the U.S., it is also relevant&#13;
to the employment experiences of women in both developed and developing coun-&#13;
tries in that women are even less able than such disadvantaged workers to&#13;
identify with workers in the primary labor market. The social definitions of&#13;
family and sex roles combine to cause underutilization and employment insta-&#13;
bility among women. As the percentage of women in the labor force increases,&#13;
some employers seem to move many jobs which were previously performed in the&#13;
primary sector (domestic work in Africa, nursing, secretarial jobs, etc.) into&#13;
the secondary market in response to the expected behavioral characteristics of&#13;
women employees. 2/&#13;
1/   D. M. Gordon, op. cit.&#13;
2/   In Africa, until fairly recently, all jobs which are usually in developed&#13;
countries performed by women were performed by men because employers felt&#13;
that women could not be relied upon to hold such posts. It is not unusual&#13;
to find domestic work being undertaken primarily by men. It was only in&#13;
the late 1950's that women were accepted in typing and secretarial jobs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
The dual labor market theory suggests that individual labor incomes&#13;
in the primary market are "largely determined by their respective access to&#13;
different job clusters, by the relatively rigid pattern of wages attached to&#13;
job structures through which they move, and by the speed with which they pass&#13;
through the structures. Differential access to internal job structures is&#13;
mediated primarily by the relative number of years of formal schooling--the&#13;
influence of which derives from the use of educational attainment as a screen-&#13;
ing device. In the secondary market, variations in total individual income&#13;
are more likely to depend on variations in hours worked than on wages.. Wages&#13;
will not reflect variations in individual characteristics." 1/ The situation&#13;
in urban Africa, however, differs from that of the United States and some of&#13;
the more developed third world countries in this respect. The proportion of&#13;
the population in the primary labor market is very small and the majority of&#13;
the labor force is in the secondary, unstructured sector of the labor market.&#13;
Consequently, this framework may be inappropriate in explaining sex differ-&#13;
ences in earnings and performance in Africa.&#13;
There is no doubt that as a group women face a variety of problems&#13;
when they enter the formal labor market. While some stem from the women' s&#13;
family circumstances, personal characteristics or both, others originate in&#13;
the structure of the labor market. Low levels of educational attainment, for&#13;
instance, may pose problems for women in locating employment. The presence&#13;
of small children in the family may also create difficulties if suitable&#13;
child care facilities are not available. Problems which may arise due to the&#13;
structure of the labor market include a possible local dearth of part-time&#13;

positions. Also employers may deem certain occupations appropriate for women&#13;
but, for economic and psychological reasons, such jobs may be considered&#13;
inappropriate by the women themselves.&#13;
Occupational discrimination due to "imagined" or "actual" taste&#13;
for discrimination by workers exists. In her analysis, Bergman 1/ attributed&#13;
wage differences between men and women to occupational segregation and the&#13;
resulting overcrowding of female jobs and occupations which caused a lowering&#13;
of the female marginal productivity within a competitive market structure.&#13;
In the African situation, however, these problems are less severe because&#13;
the low general level of development means that those married women who are&#13;
fortunate to secure appointment in positions requiring rigid working periods&#13;
can either obtain assistance with child care at very low rates or use unpaid&#13;
family members. In the formal labor market, it is thus possible to combine&#13;
with ease home and market activities. Furthermore, given the acute shortage&#13;
of trained and skilled personnel in most African countries, the patterns of&#13;
occupational segregation by sex prevalent in developed countries have not&#13;
yet developed.&#13;
The analysis presented in this paper, based on data from Tanzania&#13;
and information from other African countries, suggests that there is as&#13;
yet no evidence of wage or occupational discrimination against women. One&#13;
must therefore seek alternative explanations for differentials in earnings&#13;
and employment opportunities between men and women in urban Africa.&#13;

5.4.2     An Alternative Explanation&#13;
In economic analysis, apart from wage and occupational discrimi-&#13;
nation, a third type of discrimination has been identified - cumulative&#13;
discrimination.&#13;
Cumulative discrimination occurs whenever a worker has low produc-&#13;
tivity and therefore low wages because of past discrimination. For example,&#13;
when the choices concerning the type of training and levels of education of&#13;
younger women are affected by job patterns of older women who have been vic-&#13;
tims of past discrimination in jobs or education. 1/ Within the Becker model,&#13;
cumulative discrimination occurs from a tradition of wage and job limitation,&#13;
which would affect expectations of younger women, even when legal powers have&#13;
been used to discontinue such practices. In this case, because women are&#13;
perceived to enter into certain fields, take certain courses or attain certain&#13;
levels of education, the next generation of women are less likely to diverge&#13;
from that framework; hence the perpetuation of sex differences in earnings.&#13;
First the assumption is made that prejudice or discrimination is&#13;
the result of group behavior. Within this framework, tastes for discrimi-&#13;
nation are not given, discrimination is not innate, rather it is a mani-&#13;
festation of male power. Specifically, it is contended that men acting as&#13;
employers, governing authorities, husbands, and fathers, have control over&#13;
the female labor market. Three assumptions are essential in this model:&#13;
(a) there exists employer monopsony;&#13;
(b) the labor market can be sexually differentiated;&#13;
1/   J. F. Madden:  "The Economics of Sex Discrimination", Lexington Books,&#13;
Mass., 1973.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ill -&#13;
(c) employers perceive that the supply of female workers is&#13;
less responsive to wage changes than that of the males -&#13;
in other words, the elasticity of the supply of female&#13;
labor is less than that of the male.&#13;
Given these three assumptions, the demand for workers will be governed&#13;
both by the supply conditions and workers' productivity. The resulting&#13;
wage rate will be similar to those of a discriminating monopsony's wage&#13;
determination in that, unlike the competitive equilibrium where each worker&#13;
is paid according to his marginal product, in a monopsonistic market, because&#13;
women, given their relatively inelastic supply curve, are less responsive&#13;
to wage changes than men, employers will pay them less than their marginal&#13;
product. Within this framework, it is possible that both sets of workers,&#13;
male and female, receive wages below the competitive wage rate, but because&#13;
of either unionization by men or group pressure, they are able to obtain wages&#13;
which approximate their marginal product, whereas women are on the whole less&#13;
able to do so. To determine the female wage rate, the employer equates the&#13;
marginal cost of hiring additional female workers to the marginal cost of his&#13;
total labor force. This determines the number of female workers. The number&#13;
of male workers is obtained by subtracting the total number of female workers&#13;
from his total labor force. Wage and employment differentials therefore are&#13;
based on differences in the supply conditions between the sexes.&#13;
5.4.3     Relevance to Africa&#13;
Let us see how this explains the situation in Africa. Insofar&#13;
as African males exert economic and/or social influence over women, women and&#13;
wives are not independent. Consequently, the labor market is not competitive.&#13;
Monopsony is used in this instance to refer to behavioral characteristics&#13;
similar to those of monopsony -- wage leadership, oligopsony - "a more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
diversified basis of market power than the simple monopsony definition." 1/&#13;
The influence of such power is felt everywhere and has been commented upon&#13;
by leaders of the feminist movement. Through marriage, men and women become&#13;
dependent on one another. The dual role of wife and mother places a con-&#13;
straint on other roles a woman may seek. The primary aim of marriage in&#13;
African countries is to beget children and a woman's function of reproduction&#13;
is very essential in this respect. Parents expect their children, especially&#13;
boys, to provide for their old age, girls are expected to marry and form a&#13;
separate household. Although women are essential to the subsistence economy,&#13;
land, a vital commodity, is owned and its use is controlled by men. 2/ A&#13;
woman's children are the property of either her husband in a patrilineal&#13;
society or her maternal uncle in a matrilineal society. As a widow, she has&#13;
no rights to inherit from her husband, no basic rights to land, children,&#13;
and property. She is what Mbilinyi 3/ called a 'perpetual minor', legally&#13;
dependent on husband, father or male kinsfolk.&#13;
Very little is known by economists on family decision-making in&#13;
Africa. Our model of discrimination is based on differences in the supply&#13;
of labor of men and women to different occupations. The supply differences&#13;

not necessarily mean that women in their own right cannot purchase and&#13;
own land but that inheritance laws both codified and customary in most&#13;
African countries do not permit transmission of land through the female&#13;
sex.&#13;

depend on family (extended or nuclear) decisions relating to individual&#13;
functions within and outside the family. In rural Africa, a woman is an&#13;
extremely important part of the production unit in the subsistence sector.&#13;
She is responsible for the production of essential crops. The introduction&#13;
of cash cropping or crops brought changes in the traditional division of&#13;
labor. Although the husband controls the cash crop production and earnings&#13;
from it, the women of the household do contribute labor to cash production.&#13;
Food crop production is essentially the responsibility of the woman. If&#13;
the husband migrates in search of employment, the woman is invariably left&#13;
to tend the crops alone. The man may leave instructions on the management&#13;
of the farm, but the returns from it even in his absence are in his con-&#13;
trol. 1/ The production of cash crops and the migration of men into the&#13;
urban areas have meant more work for rural women with very little economic&#13;
reward. 2/&#13;
In order to understand how family decision making constrained and&#13;
discouraged the development of female participation in the labor force in&#13;
Africa, we have to examine the attitude of rural dwellers to education of.&#13;
their girls and the contribution of the government in extending that attitude.&#13;
Within the traditional African society, education was usually indirect and&#13;
informal. Children learned by observing and experiencing the life of the&#13;
community. Boys and girls had different roles to learn. Since the purpose&#13;
of a woman's life was perceived to center around the continuation of the human&#13;

stock, her most important function was motherhood. From this state, she&#13;
derived her status and prestige. Training for this role began early in&#13;
life as little girls assume the care of younger siblings. There were two&#13;
complementary components of this training. One was educative and related&#13;
to child care. The other was service oriented and obtained while she was&#13;
in the process of performing necessary tasks within the household economy.&#13;
Linking both was the job-related training necessary for survival in the&#13;
wider economy -- production and distribution of food. Introduction of formal&#13;
education at the turn of the present century changed the informal nature of&#13;
training and strained the traditional attitude favoring different training&#13;
for both sexes. The strain was, however, not very great in many African&#13;
countries, especially Tanzania, because schooling was not widespread. Since&#13;
parents considered the traditional schooling for preparation for life cycle&#13;
work central to a girl's education, western-type education was considered&#13;
secondary and of little consequence. Hence the higher dropout rate of girls&#13;
than boys in many East African countries.&#13;
There are other factors which mitigated against female education;&#13;
one was poverty. Even when tuition was free, books were not. In Tanzania,&#13;
for instance, although tuition in secondary schools has been free since&#13;
1967, primary schooling has not been. This meant that only those children&#13;
whose parents can afford to pay for first level education have the chance&#13;
of secondary education. In those African countries where primary tuition is&#13;
free, books and uniforms are not. If the resources of the family were not&#13;
sufficient to send all the children to school, it was the boys who were&#13;
chosen. The introduction of formal education in most African countries was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
intended to provide lower level clerks and administrators to the colonial&#13;
bureaucracy. In line with the Victorian principles of the colonisers, only&#13;
the men were expected to do these jobs. Observing the job opportunities and&#13;
their economic importance, parents gave preference to education for sons&#13;
rather than daughters. Since women were expected by custom and tradition to&#13;
be wives and mothers, the best preparation for this role was within the&#13;
household.&#13;
Schooling is an investment by parents for which they expect re-&#13;
turn. Lacking social security or old age pensions, parents expect their&#13;
sons to provide for the future. Girls marry and therefore are regarded as&#13;
a loss to the family; hence education of girls is an investment from which&#13;
no return is expected. Girls more than boys are expected to assist their&#13;
mothers in performing household and other productive duties. Their presence&#13;
in schools, therefore, leads to an added loss in the form of lower produc-&#13;
tivity within the family. Supply differences between men and women are,&#13;
therefore, determined by family decisions which affect the nature of the&#13;
individual utility function. When one is not given the opportunity of acquir-&#13;
ing these basic skills necessary for working in the modern sector, one's view&#13;
of one's capabilities is circumscribed by decisions made by others. Since&#13;
in Africa, male dominance over this process is extensive, it constitutes the&#13;
means of maintaining male dominance of the labor market.&#13;
Another important effect of family traditions on the economic posi-&#13;
tion of women is the way in which the close bond between members of the family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
prevents the female members from reacting against the effect of discrimi-&#13;
nation. In Africa especially, women perceive their status, class and income&#13;
to be dependent on the success of their men folks. Consequently, they act&#13;
to protect the cause and interests of men, even when such action is not self&#13;
serving. Referring to this tendency in women generally, Kreps 1/ concluded&#13;
for America that marriage does weaken the basis for concentrated action of&#13;
one sex against the other. This statement is even more applicable to Afri-&#13;
can women than the American women. Referring to Tanzania, Mbilinyi 2/ has&#13;
noted that women in Tanzania have been taught to be passive in the face of&#13;
male opposition; male resistence to female emancipation has been outspoken,&#13;
influential and universal in Tanzania.&#13;
Some girls were sent to school but the dropout rate among girls&#13;
has been high, influenced by the traditional attitudes discussed above. Some&#13;
parents insisted on their daughters being at home during the periods of&#13;
puberty and bethrothal. The pressure at home and school was intense. At&#13;
home, they were expected to perform their traditional functions and this left&#13;
them with very little time to study. At school, they were often intimidated&#13;
by boys. Early marriage or even preparation for marriage often necessitated&#13;
abandoning school after the first few years. In Tanzania, 40% of all first&#13;
year primary students are girls. By the time they reach the end of the pri-&#13;
mary school, the ratio has fallen to about 30%. About 8% of the girls enrolled&#13;
in primary schools are lost during the first year. Of the 48,554 girls enrolled&#13;
in primary schools in 1961, only about 15,520 were in Standard 7 in 1967. This&#13;

represents a loss of more than 67% compared to 48% when both sexes are&#13;
included. In 1965, 1,749 girls were enrolled in Form I of secondary schools,&#13;
of whom only 60% completed Form IV. Of this number, only 24% went on to&#13;
the two year college preparation grades in high school. Since 1967, the&#13;
number of children of both sexes enrolled in secondary schools has increased&#13;
tremendously, but the enrollment ratio for girls has remained fairly con-&#13;
stant at around 6%. In Kenya, to take another example, 26% of all girls who&#13;
entered primary school in 1966 did not finish in 1972, whereas only 7% of the&#13;
boys failed to do so. About 31% of the girls and 17% of the boys entering&#13;
secondary school class I in 1973 had dropped out by 1976. 1/&#13;
In many African countries, the Government has been a partner in&#13;
perpetuating the existence of male power. In Tanzania, it was not until 1972&#13;
that the government acted to minimize some of the inequalities women face&#13;
within marriage by enacting the Marriage Control Law. In Kenya, the Succes-&#13;
sion Laws do not extend to land and livestock. These laws assured the wife's&#13;
right of ownership over all properties acquired before or during marriage,&#13;
but since a wife's ownership extends only to material goods or products ac-&#13;
quired during marriage, she is left in actuality with little tangible product&#13;
given the subsistence nature of the economy. Legal powers of the Government&#13;
have been employed to enact laws, some of which have been disadvantageous to&#13;
women, for example the regulation of working hours in the factories. Through&#13;
such training programs as they do have for women (vocational education to&#13;

provide such skills as sewing, nursing, home maintenance), African govern-&#13;
ments have contributed to the tendency towards occupational segregation and&#13;
the tendency towards overcrowding of the female occupation by shifting their&#13;
supply curve and lowering their marginal productivity. Furthermore, by&#13;
maintaining a dual school system -- boys' and girls' schools -- and encour-&#13;
aging girls in the girls' schools to take courses that would prepare them for&#13;
female jobs, the Government has effectively restricted the employment oppor-&#13;
tunities open to girls. Let us illustrate with an example from Tanzania as&#13;
being typical of African countries. A part of Tanzania's policy of education&#13;
for self-reliance began in 1970 when public secondary schools were equipped&#13;
with facilities for practical subjects like agriculture, home economics,&#13;
crafts, technical skills and commercial subjects. The objective was to ensure&#13;
that graduates of these diversified schools would obtain either direct employ-&#13;
ment or engage in self-employment. Boys' schools were assured facilities to&#13;
provide technical skills offered in agriculture, engineering, and other&#13;
lucrative jobs, whereas girls' schools concentrated on home economics and&#13;
female-oriented skills, like sewing, typing and shorthand. In diversified&#13;
coeducational schools, girls are encouraged to acquire skills which are&#13;
related to female occupations. 1/&#13;
Few parents in Africa can afford to send their children to univer-&#13;
sity. The Government as bursary giver uses its position further to restrict&#13;
the few girls who have been through the education stream by awarding fewer&#13;
grants to women than to men. The result is that women tend to concentrate&#13;
on subjects which would lead to a teaching career. Admittedly the Government&#13;
can argue that there are few female candidates applying for scholarships but&#13;

this is the result of cumulative discriminatory practices perpetrated on&#13;
women by the Government. Social identification of certain jobs as male and&#13;
the paucity of females as role models contribute to the disparity between&#13;
men and women by discouraging able girls from training or applying for jobs&#13;
identified as male. 1/&#13;
The second condition for this model is the separability of the&#13;
labor market by sex. It is obvious that women are biologically different&#13;
from men. Assignment of females to jobs which by their very nature can be&#13;
better performed by women does not constitute discrimination. But it pro-&#13;
vides the monopsonist with a vehicle with which to discriminate against&#13;
women. Although one can justify the employment of a woman as a "wet nurse"&#13;
on biological grounds, it does not justify the sole use of women as recep-&#13;
tionists, telephone operators or secretaries, since there is no biological&#13;
reason why men cannot also perform such functions. Because natural dif-&#13;
ferences are not sufficient to achieve some degree of occupational sex&#13;
segregation, employers have induced greater sex differentiation by setting&#13;
sex linked requirements for particular jobs. 2/ Evidence of this exists&#13;
throughout Africa where at the onset of modernization, jobs which in indus-&#13;
trialized societies are typically female occupations were performed by men--&#13;
domestic service, secretaries, nursing--but which very recently have been&#13;
given sex linked characteristics.&#13;
1/   The situation is slightly different in English-speaking West African&#13;
countries. In Nigeria, for instance, university education has been&#13;
virtually free but available places are few compared to would be&#13;
entrants, and competition for entry by both sexes is fierce.&#13;
2/   Carol Jusenius, op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
Custom and habit may also account for sex classification of jobs.&#13;
Because men are responsible for survival of themselves and families, men in&#13;
all societies tend to be motivated from infancy towards a career. Since&#13;
women are by custom dependent on men, they tend to subordinate themselves&#13;
to the male and are less inclined to think of careers. Since women's func-&#13;
tions are traditionally related to tasks concerning the family, care of&#13;
children and older relatives, provision of food and house maintenance, pur-&#13;
chasing and selling food, women invariably choose careers in the modern&#13;
sector associated with those traditional tasks--petty trading, small farm&#13;
cultivation, house maids, serving in restaurants, nursing, etc. In all&#13;
Africa, therefore, social expectations of what is to be regarded as a proper&#13;
female role influence decisions regarding occupations by those women who seek&#13;
a role other than that of wife and mother.&#13;
Within the monopsonistic framework developed here, separation of&#13;
the labor market by sex implies wage discrimination against women only if&#13;
their labor supply to the firm is less elastic than that of the males.&#13;
No study has yet been done to measure the degree of elasticity of female&#13;
or male labor supply curves in Africa in response to wage rate changes.&#13;
The ideal way of finding this out would be to measure empirically changes&#13;
in employment by sex which result from changes in wages offered by firms.&#13;
Wage and employment data for most African countries are not available on&#13;
a firm-by-firm basis. But a priori evidence exists to support the view that&#13;
the individual female supply curve is less elastic than that of the male,&#13;
given the fact that in the male market, the competition for male labor is&#13;
between employers whereas for female labor, the employer also competeq for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
time with the demands on women's time imposed by life cycle responsibili-&#13;
ties. The implicit value of time devoted to home activities may make the&#13;
labor supply curve for women upward sloping whereas for men, the oppor-&#13;
tunity cost is constant and the labor supply curve may be horizontal for the&#13;
individual. 1/ Another reason for this may be that men in Africa generally&#13;
have more employment opportunities--including those requiring brute force and&#13;
no education--whereas women have more restricted employment opportunities.&#13;
Less direct evidence can be obtained by looking at the labor market for&#13;
skilled personnel. Entry requirements in jobs with skill unlike the unskilled&#13;
jobs require some type of formal education.&#13;
Both the Kenyan and Tanzanian Governments admit to having acted in&#13;
a discriminatory manner towards the delivery of educational services to their&#13;
female populations. Considering the disparities in education between men and&#13;
women in the educational delivery system, the Manpower Report to the Tanzanian&#13;
President 1974/75 suggests that taking into account the number of girls in&#13;
secondary schools, it seems that they have fewer number of available places&#13;
in schools than boys. The report goes on to suggest that consideration should&#13;
be given to converting some of the boys' secondary schools into coeducational&#13;
schools so as to increase the proportion of girls. The Kenyan Government is&#13;
already attempting to institute changes in the form of more coeducational&#13;
facilities, and more girls' secondary schools, and this should help to reduce&#13;
the inequality considerably. 2/ There is also a proposal to increase training&#13;
facilities for women in specific female-oriented occupational programs. This&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -&#13;
should have the effect of increasing the number of women in these occupations.&#13;
The government hopes that its policy of universal primary education will in&#13;
time lead to an increase in the number of girls in secondary schools. This&#13;
can only happen if the government would embark on a policy of unisex secondary&#13;
education. Given the government's intended policy of restricting expansion&#13;
of secondary education on the whole, an abolition of the present single sex&#13;
secondary school system would be one method of giving those girls who now&#13;
have access to primary education an equal chance of access to secondary&#13;
level education.&#13;
The 1974 Manpower Report to the President of Tanzania reported that&#13;
there were fewer facilities for girls' education than those for boys. Of the&#13;
80 public secondary schools, only 18 were solely for girls while 44 were boys'&#13;
schools and the remaining 18 were coeducational. There were 10 private girls&#13;
secondary schools compared with 21 boys' schools and 26 co-educational. With&#13;
the situation being what it is, it is not surprising that the enrollment of&#13;
girls has been maintained at the same ratio since 1961. Even in 1974, girls&#13;
represented 32% and 14% of all Form One and Form Six children respectively.&#13;
In spite of being a socialist economy, the general educational system is&#13;
organized in such a way that only 50% of the children between 7-14 get primary&#13;
education. Of those who completed the 7 year education, only 10% went on to&#13;
the next level which is a college preparatory level. The university intake&#13;
from this group is about 60%. If, for lack of facilities, few women have the&#13;
opportunity to enter the second level of education, it follows that only a&#13;
very tiny minority of them will obtain the type of training which would ensure&#13;
entry into high-income occupations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
In contrast with the coeducational character of primary schools&#13;
in Kenya, most aided secondary schools are single sex. "The distribution&#13;
of places in aided secondary schools which provide at lower cost higher&#13;
quality schooling than unaided schools shape the educational opportunities&#13;
at this stage of schooling...." In 1968 there were 143 aided schools for&#13;
boys and 61 for girls, and 28 mixed institutions. By 1977, these numbers&#13;
had risen to 200 aided boys schools and 107 girls schools and 65 coeduca-&#13;
tional schools. 1/ The number of streams in aided schools also favors the&#13;
boys. (In 1977, there were 377 streams in secondary schools for boys, 184&#13;
in girls schools and 96 in mixed schools.) The distribution confers a 2:1&#13;
advantage on boys. The above statistics do not reflect the extent of sex&#13;
typing prevalent in the educational system, which further curtails the range&#13;
of options accessible to Kenyan women who pursue secondary and vocational&#13;
training. For example, women are effectively excluded from government tech-&#13;
nical and vocational secondary schools because of accommodation difficulties&#13;
since such schools are normally for boarders.&#13;
Although a clear test of elasticity of labor supply by sex is not&#13;
possible currently due to lack of data, evidence exists to support the hypo-&#13;
thesis that in Africa, the female labor supply curve is less elastic than&#13;
the male one. This can be proven by the fact that expansion of female skilled&#13;
labor has been prevented by discriminatory practices by the government relat-&#13;
ing to provision of training facilities to women, and by fathers who do not&#13;
give their daughters access to education similar to that of their sons.&#13;

5.5 Summarv&#13;
Summing up, therefore, we can say that, given the data we have,&#13;
the analysis has indicated that in Tanzania, length of schooling, length of&#13;
time on the job and acquisition of marketable skills are the most important&#13;
influences on earnings from employment. Since women are on the whole less&#13;
skilled, less experienced and less educated, these facts reflect the income&#13;
differences between them and men. Although the empirical analysis indicates&#13;
that there is no wage discrimination by sex in the urban labor market,&#13;
evidence presented here supports our central thesis that, apart from differ-&#13;
ences in earnings due to differences in productivity associated with human&#13;
capital, it is possible in African urban labor markets for differences in&#13;
earnings from labor to be associated with sex discrimination resulting from&#13;
the dominance of the male market power in the urban economy, insofar as men&#13;
through their political power have restricted the supply of female labor.&#13;
The poor performance of women in the labor market and their low&#13;
earning profile is a result of cumulative discrimination over time in the&#13;
delivery of educational services. For both men and women, the most important&#13;
determinant of labor income is education. In the past, fathers have denied&#13;
daughters access to education but even now that parental prejudice have to&#13;
some extent been overcome, the Governments have not provided women equal&#13;
access to educational services. By restricting the intake of women into the&#13;
higher levels of educational strata, the Governments are in effect depriving&#13;
women of an important means of raising their standard of living and thereby&#13;
reinforcing their low status in society.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

CHAPTER 6&#13;
POLICY IMPLICATIONS&#13;
One of the important facts that has emerged from this study is&#13;
that women in urban Africa are the most disadvantaged group. The study has&#13;
demonstrated that although women make up over 50% or thereabouts of the&#13;
urban population, their labor market contributions are restricted to the&#13;
unstructured sector of the labor market requiring no training or skills and&#13;
therefore lower earning capacity. In the modern sector, there are relatively&#13;
few women, simply because these jobs require in most cases some form of&#13;
educational training. Furthermore, on average, women earn less than men&#13;
with the same educational qualifications. Some of the reasons for disparity&#13;
in earning can be attributed to job classifications and to the relative&#13;
lack of on-the-job experience by women, since they are in effect the last&#13;
group to enter the modern sector employment.&#13;
The most important reason for the low status of women and their&#13;
disadvantaged position in the economy is their lack of education. In&#13;
the 1974 Tanzanian Annual Manpower report to the President, the view was&#13;
expressed that at secondary level, female enrollment ratios have remained&#13;
virtually at 1961 levels. In 1961-1974 only a quarter of the state public&#13;
school places were occupied by girls. While the proportion is slightly&#13;
higher in the lower rung of the secondary schools, 1/ it falls off markedly&#13;
in the upper forms. Between 1961-1974, the Ministry of National Education&#13;
in its annual report indicated that the proportion of females enrolled in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
Form V has increased from 10% to 17%. At the same period, primary school&#13;
enrollment increased from 22% to 36% and 1/3 of first level school leavers&#13;
have been girls. The position has improved considerably above what it was&#13;
in 1971 when the survey was conducted but it is still a situation of con-&#13;
siderable concern. The situation is not very different in other African&#13;
countries. Everywhere, there has been an increase in the number of girls in&#13;
primary schools in recent years but the proportion of girls in secondary&#13;
schools has not improved at all.&#13;
President Nyerere 1/ has stressed the socialist conception of&#13;
the equality of all human beings and the fact that, for Tanzania to make&#13;
full and quick progress, women must be accorded equal opportunity with men.&#13;
Policy statements 2/ from Tanzania indicate the aim of promoting equal&#13;
access of women to education and training opportunities at all levels so&#13;
as to provide them access to better work and earning opportunities. The&#13;
report of the Government of Tanzania to the East African consultative group&#13;
meeting recently 3/ specifically stated as a government objective increasing&#13;
enrollment for girls in secondary schools so as to give them opportunity&#13;
for contributing to national development and to enable every illiterate&#13;
Tanzanian woman to become literate. In Kenya, the 1977 report of the National&#13;
Commission on Educational Objectives and Policy also stressed the importance&#13;

of providing equal access to education and training opportunities to women&#13;
especially at the secondary level, in order to provide them with equal access&#13;
to employment opportunities.&#13;
The policy statements appear to be mere rhetoric when one compares&#13;
them with the actual practice in many countries. Improvements in female&#13;
educational performance and their subsequent integration into the modern&#13;
sector are constrained by the fact that women are in a culture which accords&#13;
them very low status and which by implication makes them wards of the men&#13;
who are in positions of authority both in the family and in the government.&#13;
In some instances, parental attitude to education of girls is reinforced by&#13;
the fact that education does not necessarily improve the marketability of&#13;
the educated in the marriage market. The expectation that girls should help&#13;
with household responsibilities interferes with their attendance at school.&#13;
The teachers in the schools tend, like teachers elsewhere, to devote more&#13;
time and attention to those pupils who have the most chance of reaching the&#13;
highest possible position. This inferior position reinforces itself and the&#13;
girls invariably think that they are only suited for certain types of educa-&#13;
tion simply because they have no role models. In many girls' schools, the&#13;
tendency has been to channel girls automatically into female subjects and the&#13;
teachers themselves are unable to give those girls who wish to pursue differ-&#13;
ent subjects any encouragement.&#13;
Recently, Mbilinyi 1/ has expressed concern about the curriculum&#13;
choices offered to girls and the implications of the system of streaming for&#13;

their future prospects. The same concern has been expressed in Kenya by the&#13;
report of the National Commission on Educational Objectives and Policies in&#13;
Kenya. At the primary level in all African countries, all subjects are taken&#13;
by all the pupils irrespective of sex. Entry into secondary schools is based&#13;
on examination.&#13;
The drop-out rate of the girls at each stage is very high and&#13;
cannot be explained by lower intellectual capability than that of boys.&#13;
Apparently, the subject combinations for students at secondary level where&#13;
the instruction is in English are determined by the vocational bias of the&#13;
particular school. (Domestic science, commerce, agriculture, crafts and&#13;
technical subjects). The streaming of students in the schools depends on&#13;
teachers' recommendation based on their perception of the student ability&#13;
and performance in classroom. Subject combinations are determined by the&#13;
stream in which the student is placed and this in turn determines the future&#13;
education and occupational choices. If, as is usually the case, a girl&#13;
enters into the commerce stream, her chances of taking science or eventually&#13;
going on to post-secondary level education is virtually nil. 1/ Given the&#13;
explicit relationship in the Tanzanian case between manpower requirements&#13;
and educational opportunities, post primary education is invariably the&#13;
prerequisite for obtaining wage employment and increasing one's earning power&#13;
even at the informal labor market. In order that girls should be given equal&#13;
access to education and training, it is essential that they should also be&#13;
given the opportunity to realize their full potentiality by ensuring that not&#13;
only are enough places provided for them at schools but that they are given&#13;

African countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
freedom to pursue whatever subject they wish to undertake. The Tanzanian&#13;
Government as well as the Kenyan Government in their statemnts have often&#13;
expressed the intention of increasing the number of girl's schools, but&#13;
what is required is a policy of making all schools coeducational and ensuring&#13;
that a set number of places is given to girls in accordance with their number&#13;
in the population.&#13;
Most African governments fully realize the need to tie educational&#13;
opportunities to job opportunities. If girls are given equal access to educa-&#13;
tion with boys at all levels of educational streams, the current imbalance in&#13;
modern sector employment between the sexes may disappear within a generation.&#13;
However, the policy of creation of more places at schools for&#13;
girls will only affect the current and future school-age population of most&#13;
countries. As the survey indicated, there are currently in the urban areas&#13;
of Tanzania a large number of illiterate women or women who have had one or&#13;
two years of schooling. This situation is not different in other African&#13;
countries. These women have no prospect of modern sector jobs, and are&#13;
underemployed and have incomes below the poverty level. Many of these women&#13;
are heads of households with financial responsibilities to their families&#13;
which they are not able to meet. Adult education classes in most countries&#13;
in the past have concentrated on literacy classes. While this is not neces-&#13;
sarily bad in-so-far as it provides the participants with a means of func-&#13;
tioning in a world where understanding the written word is important, it does&#13;
not really provide the participants with the opportunity to acquire skills&#13;
and training which would help them raise their standard of living. One way&#13;
out of this is to restructure adult education classes so that, in addition to&#13;
their current literacy training role, the classes can be used as a means of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
upgrading skills and teaching the underemployed, underutilized women better&#13;
ways of utilizing the resources available in the country to meet the basic&#13;
needs of themselves and their families. Such training does not require too&#13;
much financial investment. It may just in some instances necessitate&#13;
informal training in better accounting procedures so that petty traders can&#13;
distinguish between capital and current income or it may be training on&#13;
better storage facilities for crops so as to protect them from pests.&#13;
-Another aspect of the educational system which militates against&#13;
African women is the lack of opportunity to re-enter the educational system&#13;
when one has dropped out either because of financial reasons or because of&#13;
an unplanned pregnancy. This is a universal problem. This means that a&#13;
girl who is unable to complete primary or secondary school level education&#13;
has no way of pursuing her educational career even if she so desired in the&#13;
future. Older persons of either sex are also unable under the current system&#13;
to re-enter the system for their own self-improvement. There have been dis-&#13;
cussions with UN/ECA regarding the participation of Tanzania in a project&#13;
to study the problem of female early school leavers and identify ways of&#13;
meeting their needs, particularly for training to assist them in income gen-&#13;
erating activities. This project, if it materializes, will undoubtedly&#13;
assist the girls who have been expelled from school on account of pregnancy.&#13;
However, it is suggested that the Governments should give serious considera-&#13;
tion to restructuring the educational system, so that those whose education&#13;
has been terminated for whatever reason can re-enter the system and have the&#13;
opportunity of completing their educational, training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
Policy suggestions that have emerged from this study are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(1) Girls should be provided with more access to education&#13;
by making all schools coeducational, ensuring that the&#13;
school intake reflects the ratio of the sexes in the&#13;
population, and ensuring that girls are not automatically&#13;
put into the inferior educational stream which would&#13;
not give them a chance of competing in high status and&#13;
high income jobs.&#13;
(2) Major efforts should be made to expand and modify the&#13;
adult education system to provide the current illiterate,&#13;
underemployed and poor urban women an opportunity of&#13;
upgrading their skills and ability to increase their&#13;
income.&#13;
(3) The educational system should be restructured so that&#13;
provision is made for the school dropouts and older&#13;
people to re-enter the system to obtain education which&#13;
would improve their earning potentiality.&#13;

            Women in the urban labor markets of Africa
            : the case of Tanzania
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study examines the structure and
            characteristics of the female urban labor force, the
            determinants of female employment and labor earnings and
            attempts to ascertain whether sex differences in labor
            market performance can be attributed to sex discrimination.
            Apart from the constraints arising out of the general
            economic situation in the country, factors that emerge as
            important determinants of female employment status are:
            marital status, nature of female dependence on the husband
            and educational attainment. The analysis of differentials in
            labor earnings indicates that, while African urban women may
            not suffer appreciably from sex discrimination, either in
            terms of wage level or as a result of occupational
            segregation, the urban women's low economic status in
            the labor force is primarily a result of cumulative
            discrimination over time in both the provision of and the
            demand for educational services. This has had the effect of
            limiting the supply of women in the urban labor force and
            making the female labor supply curve less elastic than that
            of men. The paper discusses some policy options that
            governments may wish to adopt to remedy the situation.
