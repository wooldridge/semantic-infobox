This report has been prepared as part of the Uruguay Pro-Growth Public Policies and Competitiveness&#13;
Programmatic Approach.&#13;
&#13;
The report provide a basic diagnostic of Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s export competitiveness challenges based on the analysis&#13;
of publicly available data and evidence, by examining export dynamics and outcomes and using field&#13;
interviews with the public and private sector. The report then formulates a number of hypotheses for an in-&#13;
depth competitiveness diagnostic of the external sector, as well as policy recommendations to further trade&#13;
integration and on how to increase benefits from integration.&#13;
&#13;
The report was prepared by a World Bank team led by Gonzalo Varela (GTCDR) under the guidance of Jesko&#13;
Hentschel (Country Director, LCC7C) and Marialisa Motta (Practice Manager, GTCDR). The following team            5&#13;
members were part of the core team of the report: Gonzalo Varela (GTCDR), Alberto Portugal (GTCDR), and&#13;
Daniel Reyes (GTCDR). Ana Fernandes (DECTI) and Esteban Ferro produced the background paper â&#128;&#152;Exporters&#13;
in Uruguay: Competitiveness and Dynamics in 2005-2013â&#128;&#153;. The macroeconomic context and public policies&#13;

Toward the beginning of the period, Uruguayan                strengthening of the Uruguayan peso that followed the&#13;
households and firms were affected by a long and             economic recovery after 2004.&#13;
&amp;#12;    As a consequence, Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s export sector experienced       at the extensive margin (exports of new products or to&#13;
    important changes during this period, which are             new destinations). The paradigmatic example is that&#13;
    reviewed in this report. The main messages that emerge      of the foreign firms that set up business in Uruguay to&#13;
    from it are the following:                                  produce chemical wood pulp and that operate within&#13;

    primary and resource-based products. The observed           export dynamism. The dynamism in this sector has&#13;
    churning at the product level shows the effects of          been driven not only by exports of traditional services&#13;
    increased commodity prices on the supply decisions of       (transport, travel, distribution) but also of modern&#13;
    firms. For example, there was a sharp increase in the       services, such as business services and Information&#13;
    exports of soybeans and wheat. Soybeans are now the         and Communication Technology (ICT), to a wide variety&#13;
    top export product (with about 2 billion dollars exported   of markets. Some of these sectors have been targeted&#13;

exporters secure a flow of profits that compensate for      however, may hide important changes in sophistication&#13;

export growth requires a better understanding of the        additional knowledge content in seeds used for key&#13;
factors constraining the export survival of firms.          crops or the case of the bovine traceability. In this latter&#13;

     growth, composition, and market share performance of&#13;
     Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s exports, as well as the countryâ&#128;&#153;s main trading&#13;
     destinations. It also briefly considers the evolution of&#13;
     FDI inflows and their sectoral composition. Section 3&#13;
     focuses on the diversification of products and markets,&#13;
     considering several measures of concentration, including&#13;
     the share of top five products and markets in exports,&#13;
     and the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index for Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

these indicators show that although Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s         Our measure of remoteness ranks Uruguay&#13;
openness to trade has been increasing over time,      183 out of 195 countries (where New Zealand&#13;

countries at a similar level of development.          Netherlands, Great Britain, and Belgium are the&#13;

Measuring the Value Added in Exports&#13;
This section focuses on Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s exports on a          exports, measured as gross exports less&#13;
value added basis using the World Bank Export           domestic and foreign inputs. This measure&#13;
of Value Added Database (Francois 2013), both           captures the true sector-specific value added&#13;
direct exports of services and indirect exports of      of exports. This is increasingly important&#13;
services when used as inputs into other sectorsâ&#128;&#153;        in an environment where global production&#13;

from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)           networks. For example, a business process&#13;
to construct country-specific measures of the           outsourcing (BPO) service from India contains&#13;
direct and indirect contribution of services to         telecommunication services, both from&#13;
the value added contained in a given countryâ&#128;&#153;s          local providers and from foreign owners of&#13;
domestic production and exports. Specifically, the      satellites. The delivery price of the BPO service&#13;
dataset contains two matrices, a domestic value         accounts for the cost of such inputs. This&#13;
added table and an export value added table,            measure nets out domestic and foreign inputs&#13;
which identifies the value added contribution of        and captures the true value added generated&#13;
particular inputs to sectors that either sell the       in the BPO sector in India.&#13;

The sectoral coverage includes 27 sectors (9         â&#128;¢	 Total value added of exports: This measure&#13;
commercial services sectors, 3 primary sectors,         adds to the direct value added of exports, the&#13;

dataset covers about 100 countries spanning             are produced domestically. To continue with&#13;
intermittent years from 1992 to 2011. We use            the above example, the measure captures the&#13;
data for Uruguay and its peer economies for 2004        value added of the BPO service plus the value&#13;

The following measures are used for goods and           This measure captures the full domestic&#13;

a given product or sector. The indicator should then be interpreted      since exports from free zones are not included. A way&#13;
with caution, and complemented with other indicators, such as            to partially address this data constraint is to look&#13;
diversification of markets and measurements of export quality.&#13;

            world share of that sector in total world exports. An RCA index above the unit indicates that the countryâ&#128;&#153;s share of exports in that sector&#13;

crucial to keep production costs down. The challenges                    about output flows and reducing the incentive for firms&#13;
identified in this area are related to the depth of sea/                 to move into higher value added or relatively more&#13;

     Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s performance in terms of diversification along        booms, Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s exports are relatively diversified&#13;

     Two useful indicators of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s diversification           concentration, moreover, appears to be a trend shared&#13;
     are the number of product varieties exported in a              by all benchmark countries as most (with the exception&#13;
     period and the number of markets reached by these              of Costa Rica) are natural-resource rich and their&#13;
     products. Figure 37a and Figure 37b present these two          export patterns were affected by the commodity price&#13;
     indicators for Uruguay and comparators between 2000            boom. Regarding destinations, Uruguay was relatively&#13;
     and 2013.                                                      concentrated compared to benchmark countries in&#13;
                                                                    the period 1998â&#128;&#147;2000 but has recently experienced a&#13;
     Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s level of diversification in terms of products        reduction in its HHI (Figure 38b). Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s average HHI&#13;
     exported and of destinations reached has increased             value (0.08) for 2011â&#128;&#147;2013 is quite low when compared&#13;
     since 2000. Figure 37a shows that the number of                to Costa Ricaâ&#128;&#153;s (0.16) and Chileâ&#128;&#153;s (0.09).&#13;
     products exported is below all benchmark countries&#13;
48&#13;
     except Paraguay. However, Uruguay has also expanded            An alternative way to measure concentration is to&#13;
     its export product scope during this period. In 2013,          look at the share of export value accounted for by&#13;
     for example, Uruguay exported 606 product varieties            the top five products exported or by the top five&#13;
     compared to 411 exported in 2002. Moreover, along              markets served. When compared with other resource-&#13;
     the destination dimension, Uruguay has increased the           rich countries, Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s export revenues are not&#13;
     number of export markets served quite impressively             extremely concentrated in the top five products, as&#13;
     (Figure 37b). Uruguay has outperformed Costa Rica              can be seen in Figure 39a. Indeed, during 2011â&#128;&#147;2013,&#13;
     and Paraguay in this regard and has converged to the           the top five export products accounted for 39 percent&#13;
     number of destinations reached by substantially larger         of export revenues. This is lower when compared to&#13;
     economies such as Chile and Argentina.                         the levels of concentration of Chile (56 percent), Costa&#13;
                                                                    Rica (42 percent), or Paraguay (73 percent). However,&#13;
     Concentration                                                  the comparison across periods reveals an increase in&#13;
                                                                    concentrationâ&#128;&#148;again consistent with the commodity&#13;
     While looking at the number of products exported and           boom and the increases in land productivity experienced&#13;
     the destinations reached is useful to assess the extent        during the period of analysis that resulted in high growth&#13;
     to which a country is diversified, these indicators have       rates of the main export products. For example, during&#13;
     limitations. Consider, for instance, two countriesâ&#128;&#148;one         1998â&#128;&#147;2000, Uruguayâ&#128;&#153;s top five products accounted for&#13;
     that exports to 100 destinations but only one of these         only 28 percent of the exports. In contrast, concentration&#13;
     markets concentrates 90 percent of total exports               remained relatively stable when looking at the top five&#13;
     and another one that spreads its exports among 100             destinations (although as mentioned, these top five&#13;
     destinations with equal share. The former is much more         destinations changed during the period). As Figure 39b&#13;
     concentrated than the latter. The Hirschman-Herfindahl&#13;
     Index (HHI) allows comparing export concentration              21â&#128;&#131; The HHI is computed as the sum of squared shares of each&#13;
                                                                    product (market) in total export. A country with a perfectly&#13;
     of two or more countries that may be equal in terms            diversified export portfolio will have an index close to 0, whereas a&#13;
     of number of products (or markets) but may vary in             country with only one export (market) will have a value of 1 (least&#13;
                                                                    diversified).&#13;

     has a clear revealed comparative advantage show the         by increased sales of the same products to the same&#13;
     highest destination scope. For example, Uruguayan           markets (intensive margin of export growth) and&#13;
     animal products reached over 110 destinations in 2013,      the portion explained by increased sales of the same&#13;
     up from less than 80 in 2000. Similarly, vegetable          products to new markets, new products to the same&#13;
     products, foodstuffs, and chemicals are exported to         markets, or new products to new markets (the latter&#13;

     and that are complementary to MERCOSUR. Three                     connected to the international economy.&#13;
     examples are considered: (a) product by product&#13;
     negotiations; (b) trade in services negotiations; and (c)     	   In this context, it is important that Uruguay&#13;

     agreements to reduce double taxation.&#13;

     (a)	 Negotiating access to specific products subject              map the costs and benefits of these potential trade&#13;

these interventions are justified because it is difficult   their effectiveness will also depend on the institutional&#13;

&amp;#12;From an examination of the literature on export              The Spanish Institute for Foreign Trade (ICEX)&#13;
promotion activities, we can learn the following:            and AusTrade in Australia, for example, have&#13;
                                                             been providing training to SMEs on managerial&#13;
1.	 Export promotion activities focusing on reducing         international best practices. To date, to the best of&#13;
    costs associated with information search (for            our knowledge, rigorous impact evaluations of these&#13;
    example, providing market research and trade             types of training activities on exporters have not been&#13;
    intelligence and matching buyers with sellers) tend      conducted. Two more recent similar activities, one in&#13;
    to have a positive effect on export diversification      Colombia and another planned for Argentina, have been&#13;
    (mainly along the market dimension and weaker            designed to allow for the evaluation of its impact and will&#13;
    along the product dimension) while generally having      provide some additional information in the near future.&#13;
    no effect on the growth of exports of the same&#13;
    products to the same markets. This is reasonable&#13;
    since information is more crucial in the process of&#13;
    diversification.&#13;
&#13;
2.	 Support for participation in trade fairs and trade&#13;
    missions shows weak evidence, if any, of positive&#13;
    effects on export growth.&#13;
&#13;
3.	 Counseling and export committees in which exporters&#13;
    exchange information and in which mentorship is&#13;
    provided tend to be effective in reducing information&#13;
    costs for firms and increasing participation in export&#13;
    markets.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                           55&#13;
4.	Bundled services tend to perform better than&#13;
   isolated interventions.&#13;
&#13;
5.	 The effects of export promotion activities diminish&#13;
    relatively fast over time; after-care services may be&#13;
    needed.&#13;
&#13;
Some of the informational barriers that exporters&#13;
face are subtler than finding buyers or doing&#13;
market research and may be related to the design of&#13;
strategies to conceive, produce, and market products&#13;
that are fit for foreign markets. These strategies&#13;
are not implemented as isolated improvements in&#13;
the firmâ&#128;&#153;s operations but as coherent elements of a&#13;
different approach to business. Artopoulos, Friel, and&#13;
Hallak (2010) termed these export-related managerial&#13;
practices â&#128;&#152;export business modelâ&#128;&#153; (EBM). The authors&#13;
provide evidence that firms that adopt drastic changes&#13;
in their production and market methods are more&#13;
successful in entering and surviving in international&#13;
markets. Informational barriers may prevent especially&#13;
small firms from adopting these managerial practices.&#13;

     technological content has its caveats. For example, although         measure of relative quality (see definition in Box 6) for&#13;
     beef is classified as a primary product, the technological content&#13;
     of Uruguayan beef has increased substantially through, for           the top ten Uruguayan exports defined at the HS-6&#13;
     example, the bovine traceability from birth to the meatpackerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     premises. Similarly, technological change in agriculture has been    23â&#128;&#131; The EXPY indicator has been subject to substantial criticism&#13;

     factors are not taken into account in the Lall classification. The   of production processes, in what stage of production of a given&#13;
     reader should consider these caveats when interpreting these         product is a country involved mostly, rather than what product it is&#13;

     development efforts put into Uruguayan export products has been      addition, it also matters how the product is produced, rather than&#13;
     commissioned by Uruguay XXI and developed by CINVE.                  which one is produced.&#13;

         Calculating export sophistication, denoted by        percentage of a poor countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports but is a&#13;
         EXPY, is a two-stage process. The first stage        significant component of many rich countriesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
         is to measure the income level associated with       export baskets.&#13;
         each product in the world, termed â&#128;&#152;PRODYâ&#128;&#153;. The&#13;
         PRODY of a particular product is the GDP per         The second stage is to measure the income&#13;
         capita of the typical country that exports that      associated with a countryâ&#128;&#153;s export basket as&#13;
         good. Typical GDP is calculated by weighting         a whole; this is its EXPY. From the first stage,&#13;
         the GDP per capita of all countries exporting the    each product that a country exports will have a&#13;
         good. The weight given to each country is based      PRODY. The EXPY is calculated by weighting the&#13;
         on â&#128;&#152;revealed comparative advantageâ&#128;&#153;, defined as      PRODY by the share that each good contributes&#13;
         the share of its exports that comes from that        to total exports. If butter makes up 15 percent&#13;
         good relative to the â&#128;&#152;averageâ&#128;&#153; country. The PRODY    of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports, its PRODY will be given a&#13;
         for a single product is calculated by weighting      weight of 0.15. Countries whose export baskets&#13;

               Measuring Relative Quality of Exports Using Disaggregate Trade Data&#13;
               We rely on the UN-COMTRADE database to&#13;
               characterize the relative unit values of exports.&#13;
               As in Schott (2004), unit values were calculated&#13;
               simply as the quotient of general imports values       where u itc denotes the unit value of the good and&#13;
               and quantities. Within any product (six-digit          u it90 denotes the value at the 90th percentile of&#13;
               combined nomenclature code) for any given year,        the unit value distribution across countries for&#13;
               we then have a distribution of unit values of          that product. R itc denotes the relative quality of&#13;
               imports from the different source countries. For       the countryâ&#128;&#153;s export of that good, that is, quality&#13;
               each good i and exporting country c, in time year      relative to other countries exporting the same&#13;

            Uruguay - Trade competitiveness diagnostic
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            As a small economy, Uruguay’s growth and
            poverty reduction prospects are closely related to its
            performance in international markets. This report analyzes
            export dynamics in Uruguay over the period 2000-2013,
            benchmarking them against relevant comparator countries. It
            looks at export outcomes through four different dimensions
            of export performance: (1) the evolution, composition, and
            growth orientation of the country’s export basket; (2) the
            degree of diversification across products and markets; (3)
            the level of sophistication and quality; and (4) the
            survival rate of export relationships. The report offers a
            number of hypotheses for an in-depth competitiveness
            diagnostic of Uruguay’s external sector, as well as policy
            recommendations to increase integration and to gain from it.
            In addition to the real depreciation of the peso that
            followed the crisis, the international prices of Uruguay’s
            main export products soared. This stimulated investment in
            technological improvements in the production of these
            natural-resource-intensive products. Section one analyzes
            the macroeconomic environment in which exporters operate in
            Uruguay during the period of analysis. Section two looks at
            level, growth, composition, and market share performance of
            Uruguay’s exports, as well as the country’s main trading
            destinations. Section three focuses on the diversification
            of products and markets, considering several measures of
            concentration, including the share of top five products and
            markets in exports, and the Hirschman-Herfindahl index for
            Uruguay’s export portfolio. Sections four and five address
            quality and sophistication and survival, respectively.
