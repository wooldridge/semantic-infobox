1. URBANIZATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
A. URBANIZATION: GROWTH AND IMPACT&#13;
1.1   National economic policies and resource allocation practices in China sought until&#13;
the mid-1980s to limit urban population growth and restrain expenditures on essential urban&#13;
infrastructure. Urban population expansion was controlled through resident permits and&#13;
grain rationing. With accelerating economic growth and a relaxation of control on&#13;
migration, urban growth rates averaged 4.2 percent through the 1980s, then jumped to&#13;
nearly 6 percent with the economic boom that started in 1992. Currently, the urban&#13;
population is increasing at about 5 percent a year, and urban GDP is growing at an annual&#13;
15 percent. Although the overall urbanization rate is still only 28 percent, in absolute terms,&#13;
China now has the world's largest urban population-340 million "permanent" residents&#13;
and another 70 million "temporary" residents in 600 cities and 15,000 statutory towns.&#13;
Thirty-two cities have more than I million residents within the city boundaries, and another&#13;
30 cities each have more than 500,000 residents. Given these trends, the majority of&#13;
China's population-an estimated 700 million persons-will live in existing or emerging&#13;
urban areas by the year 2010.&#13;
1.2   Growing urban population and industrialization are causing widespread pollution&#13;
in China, and environmental problems have become a central issue in Chinese cities.'&#13;
Industrial production, particularly by outdated plants and fuel systems, has generated&#13;
serious urban pollution problems of all types but particularly water pollution that directly&#13;
affects human health. Many important water resources, which are already scarce in most&#13;
regions, have been seriously threatened. Industrial wastewater is the predominant source&#13;
of pollution, in some cases contributing up to 70 to 80 percent of the pollutant load.&#13;
During 1984-92, only about 13 percent of the estimated 25 billion tons of industrial&#13;
wastewater annually discharged throughout China was treated, and often only to the&#13;
extent of pretreatment. After treatment, only about half of this water met effluent&#13;
discharge standards. While industrial wastewater discharge has been kept constant&#13;
through water use quotas and water recycling requirements, municipal (domestic and&#13;
commercial) wastewater discharges have increased rapidly, from about 7 billion tons in&#13;
1984 to about 13 billion tons in 1992. Municipal wastewater treatment capacity can&#13;
currently handle only about 4.5 percent of municipal wastewater flows, while industrial&#13;
pretreatment raises overall treatment rates to 17 percent.&#13;
1 For a detailed discussion please see "China: Environmental Strategy Paper" (Report No. 9669-CHA, April&#13;
1992); and "China: Urban Environmental Service Managemenf' (Report No. 13073-CHA, December&#13;
1994).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
B. URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES: CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS AND ISSUES&#13;
Organization and Financing&#13;
1.3   Urban environmental services, including water supply, wastewater collection and&#13;
treatment systems, and solid waste collection and treatment, are handled by city&#13;
Construction Commissions, which oversee the municipal bureaus and companies directly&#13;
responsible for providing services. The Commissions are typically among the largest and&#13;
most powerful of the municipal administrative bodies. The Central Government confines&#13;
itself to providing guidance and interregional coordination. The Ministry of Construction&#13;
sets physical and financial performance standards for the services, appraises major&#13;
investments in the sector to help guarantee adherence to standards, and provides guidance&#13;
in implementing new management approaches. The National Environmental Protection&#13;
Agency (NEPA) similarly provides technical and policy guidance on environmental&#13;
issues and implementation of the national environmental protection system, comprising a&#13;
broad set of control instruments administered by local environmental protection bureaus.&#13;
1.4   Local governments have great latitude to manage their own affairs and, subject to&#13;
tax-sharing arrangements and annual consultation with the central authorities, are largely&#13;
free to allocate resources according to their own priorities. Those resources are largely&#13;
derived from local taxes and the earnings of municipal enterprises, supplemented to some&#13;
extent by Central Government investments and (increasingly scarce) grants. Even on&#13;
technical and regulatory matters, local agencies are free to adapt national guidelines and&#13;
standards to their specific circumstances.&#13;
Issues&#13;
1.5   While progress in decentralization is important for effective, efficient urban&#13;
environmental management, the adequacy and sustainability of the current system is&#13;
severely limited by the need to improve: (a) arrangements for mobilizing financial&#13;
resources; (b) institutional capacity to meet the growing challenges faced; and&#13;
(c) environmental policies and institutions to maximize pollution prevention and exert&#13;
effective oversight and regulatory enforcement.&#13;
1.6   Financing. China subscribes to the "polluter-pays" principle of environmental&#13;
management. As is common in other countries, a combination of administrative sanctions&#13;
and economic incentives is used to induce desired behavior. However, China has&#13;
consistently underpriced water supplies and wastewater treatment. The major policy&#13;
problem identified in the Bank's study, China: Urban Environmental Service Management&#13;
(Report No. 13073-CHA, December 1994) was the dependence on municipal budget&#13;
transfers to fund environmental services and the failure to charge, or charge adequately, for&#13;
those services. Although cities have long charged for water delivery, residential wastewater&#13;
charges are virtually unknown, while enterprise charges have been rare, and where&#13;
collected, fall far below operating needs. An important consequence of this failure to&#13;
charge adequate user fees is that service investment programs have failed to meet goals due&#13;
to lack of finance. The Ministry of Construction estimates that two thirds of the municipal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
wastewater treatment plants either do not operate, or operate far below capacity, due to lack&#13;
of funds. And, when users do not have to pay, they have no incentive to reduce waste&#13;
volumes. This creates the need for larger service systems when they are provided.&#13;
Evidence of that comes from analysis of water and wastewater company finances and from&#13;
studies that have shown industrial wastewater streams to be highly dilute compared to those&#13;
from similar industries elsewhere in the world. Underpricing leads not only to excess&#13;
demand and needlessly large water and wastewater streams, but also to reduced removal&#13;
efficiencies experienced when treating dilute wastewaters. Thus, greater reliance on user&#13;
charges would induce resource conservation, and create a more dependable income stream&#13;
for system operation and maintenance; Bank analysis indicates that such charges would be&#13;
affordable.&#13;
1.7   Commercialization.  Institutionally, there is a need to introduce commercial&#13;
practices for all urban environmental services. Currently, water systems tend to be run by&#13;
financially autonomous enterprises, while wastewater collection and treatment as well as&#13;
solid waste collection and disposal are managed by city government bureaus that see their&#13;
role as providing welfare services. Managing bureaus do not depreciate fixed assets, so&#13;
they cannot identify the true cost of service provision. Nor do their accounting practices&#13;
provide managers with the financial tools needed for efficient management. Financially&#13;
autonomous wastewater agencies need to be established, using enterprise accounting rules&#13;
that allow them to set tariffs which at least fully recover costs. Environmental sanitation&#13;
bureaus handling solid wastes need to introduce cost accounting techniques that permit&#13;
them to identify the cost of operations so that they can charge those full costs to the&#13;
commercial and industrial users of their services.&#13;
1.8   Regulation. NEPA is the lead agency for environmental management in China,&#13;
with authority to draft national regulations and other aspects of environmental policy and to&#13;
interpret national environmental regulations and  standards.   However, it lacks&#13;
implementation authority, a power left to local governments and environmental protection&#13;
bureaus (EPBs). Provincial EPBs coordinate local policies, while municipal, urban district&#13;
and county EPBs bear the main burden of enforcement for both national and provincial&#13;
regulations. Since local governments usually own the major enterprises within their&#13;
boundaries, pressures may be exerted on the EPBs to relax regulation or fee collection in the&#13;
interest of employment and profits. Also, enterprises operating on the periphery of cities&#13;
may have a large impact on municipal environmental quality, yet fall outside municipal&#13;
control.  Furthermore, one of the main regulatory instruments, pollution levy fees&#13;
chargeable against waste streams with pollutant concentrations above permitted levels, are&#13;
typically set below the marginal cost of effluent treatment, which encourages enterprises to&#13;
pay the fee rather than address the problem.&#13;
1.9   The proposed project continues efforts under the FY87 Bank Group-assisted&#13;
sewerage project, the Shanghai Sewerage Project-SSPI (Loan 2794/Credit 1779-CHA),&#13;
to address the financial and institutional factors limiting effective wastewater&#13;
management in Shanghai, China's largest city, while the FY94 Bank-assisted Shanghai&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
Environment Project-SEP (Loan 371 1-CHA) is dealing with issues of environmental&#13;
regulatory enforcement in the city.&#13;
C. BANK GROUP SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
1.10  As indicated in the China Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the&#13;
Board in June 1995, Bank Group support for urban environmental management in China&#13;
follows directly from two of our four areas of concentration in the country-enhancing&#13;
enviromnental protection and alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks.  Our support,&#13;
designed in close collaboration with our Chinese counterparts, covers both the regulatory&#13;
and service provision aspects of this increasingly important sector. On the regulatory&#13;
side, the China. Environmental Strategy Paper led to an Environmental Technical&#13;
Assistance Project (Credit 2522-CHA), which assists NEPA to find more efficient&#13;
regulatory methods, improve staff capabilities and bolster environmental monitoring.&#13;
That project complements Bank-administered, Japanese Government-financed technical&#13;
assistance to NEPA in other critical areas.&#13;
1.11  Service delivery as well as enhanced regulatory capacity at the local level are&#13;
supported under five ongoing urban environrnental projects in eight cities, which&#13;
incorporate policy, financing and organizational strategies for improved environmental&#13;
regulation and service delivery at the provincial and municipal levels. Another four&#13;
ongoing investment projects involving 12 cities include related issues such as municipal&#13;
water supply and sanitation. Most of these projects focus on China's largest cities-&#13;
Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin-and those located primarily in the wealthier northeastern&#13;
and coastal provinces. Environmental pressures remain very high in these areas and&#13;
cooperation will continue, for example, under the proposed Second Shanghai Sewerage&#13;
Project (SSPII) and the Shandong Environment Project now being prepared. These&#13;
initiatives are balanced by a move to assist inland and poorer areas, as exemplified by the&#13;
recently approved Hubei Urban Environmental Project (Loan 3966/Credit 2799-CHA),&#13;
for a medium-income province in central China, as well as projects being prepared by the&#13;
very poor provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi, which will further test the feasibility of&#13;
policy and institutional solutions.&#13;
1.12  Our strategy for Shanghai responds in general to current and previous CAS&#13;
objectives and in particular to the recommendations of a 1986 study on an optimal&#13;
wastewater management strategy for Shanghai and Shanghai's Environmental Master&#13;
Plan prepared in 1995 with Australian assistance. SSPI supported wastewater system&#13;
investments in the northern part of the city, complemented by establishment of the&#13;
Shanghai Sewerage Company-SSC [reorganized in December 1995 as the Shanghai&#13;
Municipal Sewerage Company, Ltd.-SMSC (para. 4.1)], a comprehensive training&#13;
program for SSC staff, and four studies-of SSC's future organizational and staffing&#13;
needs, appropriate tariffs, water resource management in the Huangpu River Basin, and&#13;
economic approaches to rehabilitating the existing combined sewerage system. SEP&#13;
provides complementary support focused on improving and protecting drinking water&#13;
quality and controlling pollution. Key project features include construction of a major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
raw water supply intake, improvements in the water distribution network, institutional&#13;
strengthening, enhanced environmental monitoring and preparation of a water supply&#13;
master plan.   The proposed second sewerage project emphasizes institutional&#13;
development, including organizational strengthening of SMSC, further financial capacity&#13;
building, and investments in the southem part of the city's wastewater management&#13;
system.  On completion, these projects will have:  (a) established economically&#13;
sustainable and financially viable water and wastewater pricing policies and institutions;&#13;
(b) initiated Shanghai's long-term wastewater management strategy and operation of&#13;
improved and affordable water and wastewater services; and (c) launched a phased&#13;
strategy to arrest environmental degradation of the Huangpu River and the surrounding&#13;
watercourses, enabling regional economic growth consistent with the vision of the&#13;
Shanghai government.&#13;
1.13  The Bank's assistance to Shanghai in addressing these problems is particularly&#13;
important because of Shanghai's role as a leader in urban environmental management and&#13;
protection throughout China.  Shanghai's environmental problems typify those in&#13;
Chinese cities, and the city is a development model for other Chinese urban areas.&#13;
Successful completion of the wastewater system would give impetus to that aspect of our&#13;
sector policy dialogue, a crucial element of which seeks adequate pricing for and the&#13;
financial sustainability of urban services. Though a difficult issue for the Shanghai&#13;
Municipal Government (SMG) in the current inflationary environment, the 30 percent&#13;
water tariff increase already implemented under SEP signaled a willingness to deal&#13;
effectively with this challenge. The higher water tariffs agreed under that project would&#13;
further moderate water demand and hence wastewater flows, increase revenue, and enable&#13;
more efficient urban services management. The approval in July 1995 of average&#13;
wastewater tariff increases in Shanghai of some 100 percent through the proposed project&#13;
would promote Government national policy and Bank Group efforts to introduce these&#13;
practices in other provinces where projects are being prepared for Bank assistance.&#13;

2.1   Shanghai Municipality (SM), one of three provincial-level cities in China, is the&#13;
country's largest contiguous urban center, with a permanent, registered population&#13;
approaching 13 million and a temporary population of about 3 million. The city is China's&#13;
most important industrial base, and the major center of commerce, trade, finance and&#13;
science. Shanghai's per capita gross domestic project (GDP) in 1993 was Y 11,205 (almost&#13;
four times the national average, 2.3 times that of Guangdong, and 44 percent higher than in&#13;
Beijing). After decades of neglect and comparatively low economic growth, economic and&#13;
institutional reforms during the 1990s have allowed the city to recapture its former&#13;
importance in China (and the world) and have led to real annual GDP growth rates of&#13;
almost 15 percent in the first half of the decade. From 1990 to 1993, Shanghai's per capita&#13;
GDP grew by 36 percent in real terms.&#13;
2.2   Over 78 percent of Shanghai's population is concentrated in the municipality's&#13;
urban zone of 254 square kilometers (kn2). The greater Shanghai area also includes nine&#13;
rural counties and covers 6,340 km . Counting temporary residents, at least half of whom&#13;
are rural migrants, Shanghai has an urban population density of just under 50,000&#13;
inhabitants per km., making it one of the world's most densely populated cities.&#13;
Although natural population growth rates have declined markedly in recent years (to&#13;
minus 0.08 percent in 1993 in the urban area), Shanghai's population is expected to&#13;
continue to grow to at least 17 million people by the year 2000, largely due to a growing&#13;
number of rural migrants seeking employment in China's premier commercial center.&#13;
2.3   Shanghai has regional importance as well, by being situated at the mouth of the&#13;
Changjiang (Yangtze River) and thus at the heart of the Yangtze Delta Economic Region&#13;
(YDER), which includes Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces (see IBRD Map 27376).&#13;
The YDER has a population of 193 million-the same as Indonesia's-and is the&#13;
principal economic producer in China, providing 22.1 percent of GDP and 39.4 percent of&#13;
secondary sector GDP.&#13;
2.4   Demographic and economic trends in Shanghai and the YDER have major&#13;
implications in terms of demand for municipal infrastructure and the spatial distribution&#13;
of this demand. Rapid urban growth is causing increased domestic and industrial&#13;
wastewater discharges, new suburban growth poles are attracting inner-city residents&#13;
whose urban communities are being redeveloped, and job opportunities are attracting&#13;
large inflows of migrant workers. Planning for Shanghai's environmental infrastructure&#13;
must cater for all of these trends.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
B. WATER RESOURCE DEGRADATION IN SHANGHAI&#13;
2.5   Shanghai, located where the Changjiang joins the East China Sea, has numerous&#13;
watercourses and canals flowing through the municipal area. These waters mainly drain&#13;
to the Huangpu River, which passes through the city center and flows into the&#13;
Changjiang. The water courses are interconnected and tidal, experiencing several hours a&#13;
day of reverse flows during high tides. The waterways serve many functions, among&#13;
them receiving stormwater and industrial wastewater flows, and acting as major transport&#13;
corridors. The Shanghai Municipal Waterworks Company (SMWC) supplies the city&#13;
with water abstracted principally from the Huangpu River, which is then treated and&#13;
pumped into an extensive distribution network. Industry also abstracts water from the&#13;
River for its own uses.&#13;
2.6   Still, low wastewater collection and treatment levels in Shanghai have resulted in&#13;
substantial pollutant loads entering the surrounding waterways, causing major&#13;
environmental and ecological damage to the water resources. This poses significant&#13;
health risks and restricts economic growth. Fish cannot live in the lower Huangpu and&#13;
tributary streams, and shellfish downstream of the city carry very high pathogen levels&#13;
that result in illness when eaten by humans. The river system tides drive pollutants&#13;
upstream as far as Shanghai's drinking water treatment plant intakes. Not only has this&#13;
forced massive investment to relocate these intakes to safer areas, but it has also&#13;
considerably increased water treatment costs and given rise to a high and costly risk of&#13;
emergency water treatment shutdowns. Inevitably, domestic sources of pollutants will&#13;
further increase over the next few years, as living standards rise and the 50 percent of&#13;
Shanghai's citizens, who currently rely on yard taps and nightsoil buckets (emptied daily&#13;
to holding tanks) for indoor sanitation, relocate to housing with flush toilets and indoor&#13;
taps that allow the use of washing machines and other conveniences.&#13;
C. SHANGHAI'S WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM&#13;
Wastewater Management Strategy&#13;
2.7   About a decade ago, both the central government and SMG recognized the serious&#13;
backlog in the provision of basic and essential urban environmental services in Shanghai,&#13;
and took action to begin the necessarily long process of putting in place the physical&#13;
infrastructure and institutional capacity for adequate wastewater management. In 1986,&#13;
SMG completed a study identifying an optimal wastewater management strategy for the&#13;
city, comprising a two-phased investment program of combined wastewater collection&#13;
systems, to be managed by a financially sustainable urban wastewater utility which would&#13;
charge for services. Phase I of the investment program covered 1987-95; Phase II includes&#13;
three stages of works (1996-98, 1999-2006, and 2007-2010) to accommodate flows up to&#13;
the year 2020.&#13;
2.8   The strategy also calls for: (a) conveying wastewater to the Changjiang rather&#13;
than to the Huangpu, which now has very limited assimilative capacity; (b) phasing out&#13;
the nightsoil and septic tank systems; (c) reducing the water volumes extracted by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
industries from the Huangpu, with consequent reductions in wastewater discharges. The&#13;
latter would be achieved by reorienting industries from "end-of-pipe" treatment to a&#13;
"clean technology" approach. In the latter connection, industries would be encouraged to&#13;
keep cooling water streams (which tend to be warmer than intake water) separate from&#13;
other waters, and recycle water where possible; (d) continuing use of combined sewerage&#13;
and stormwater systems where they already exist but switching to separate systems where&#13;
feasible such as when new construction is being undertaken, as in Pudong; (e) providing&#13;
treatment before discharge to the Changjiang in order to limit the total phosphorus&#13;
discharged to less than 18 tons/day; and (f) phasing out existing small municipal&#13;
treatment plants when they become obsolete and conveying the flows to the Changjiang.&#13;
2.9   With Bank assistance under the previous and proposed sewerage projects, SMG is&#13;
pursuing that strategy, which has been validated by subsequent technical analysis&#13;
factoring in the impact of more recent developments. The ultimate environmental&#13;
objective of these projects is to raise the quality of water in both the network of city&#13;
canals and the Huangpu River. Canal water, now failing to reach even the lowest level&#13;
needed for productive use, would be raised to no lower than Category IV quality, suitable&#13;
for fishery, industrial and agricultural use. Water quality in the Huangpu, which in its&#13;
lower reach now falls below a level suitable for industrial use, would be raised to&#13;
Category IIT, suitable as a raw water source for municipal treatment plants. This very&#13;
significant improvement is critical to the health of the city's people and to the vitality of&#13;
its economy.&#13;
System Facilities&#13;
2.10  The Conveyance System. Shanghai's sewerage system currently collects about&#13;
48 percent [or 2.6 million (M) m3/day] of total wastewater flows of 5.4 Mm3/day, with the&#13;
remainder discharged directly into the city canals or the Huangpu.  Prior to the&#13;
commissioning in 1993 of the main interceptor constructed under SSPI, only about 1.2&#13;
Mm 3/day was collected. SSPI works were concentrated in the city's northern section.&#13;
2.11   Collected wastewater is discharged as follows: 700,000 m3/day flows to the&#13;
Changjiang via the western interceptor at Shidonkou; 500,000 m3/day flows to the East&#13;
China Sea via the southern interceptor at Bailonggang; and 1.4 Mm3/day flows to the&#13;
Changjiang via the Zhuyuan interceptor constructed under the first sewerage project. The&#13;
Changjiang's assimilative capacity at Zhuyuan ensures no adverse effect to downstream&#13;
users. Recent studies have confirmed that discharge of wastewater from Shanghai to the&#13;
Huangpu River is no longer sustainable in terms of either the River's assimilative&#13;
capacity or, most importantly, its role as the primary source of potable water for the city.&#13;
All wastewater is therefore being conveyed to the Changjiang estuary where, after&#13;
treatment (pretreatment or, in the medium term, primary treatment to remove phosphorus,&#13;
thereby minimizing eutrophication), the effluent is discharged through submerged ocean&#13;
outfalls and diffuser systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
2.12  The second phase of the conveyance system to be constructed under the proposed&#13;
project would serve the rapidly developing Pudong and Puxi areas in the southern part of&#13;
the city, covering some 240 km2. The system would be designed to handle 1.7 Mm3/day&#13;
and be sized to capture projected flows of 5.0 Mm3/day in the year 2020. The flows&#13;
would be discharged through a submerged outfall to the Changjiang at Bailonggang,&#13;
some 25 km downstream of Zhuyuan. Extensive modeling of the Bailonggang area has&#13;
confirmed that the Changjiang has sufficient assimilative capacity, and that the&#13;
environmental impact of the discharges at Bailonggang and in the adjacent Hangzhou&#13;
Bay would be acceptable.&#13;
2.13  Treatment Facilities. Less than two thirds of the wastewater collected receives any&#13;
form of treatment, most of that being restricted mainly to pretreatment of industrial wastes,&#13;
or through septic tanks from which the effluents are discharged into nearby waterways. The&#13;
12 existing treatment plants, most handling no more than 40,000 m3/day, operate at less&#13;
than half their design capacity and handle about 3 percent of Shanghai's average dry-&#13;
weather flows, usually at the secondary treatment level.&#13;
2.14  The proposed project would rehabilitate the systems and facilities associated with&#13;
three existing treatment plants of about 255,000 m3/day total capacity at Quyang, Tianshan&#13;
and Longhua. As mentioned above, studies indicate that discharges at Bailonggang from&#13;
the proposed project's conveyor system would require only preliminary treatment&#13;
(screening and grit removal) in the medium term. However, land has been allocated for the&#13;
future construction of a chemically-assisted primary wastewater treatment plan, with an&#13;
initial capacity of about 0.86 Mm /day. Engineering studies for the treatment plant are&#13;
underway, ensuring that the plant could be constructed in stages as pollution loads and&#13;
flows increase over time, commencing in about the year 2000. The environmental objective&#13;
would be to ensure that phosphorus levels discharged do not cause eutrophication in the&#13;
vicinity, and that dissolved oxygen levels do not endanger marine life. This phased strategy&#13;
is the least-cost approach to environmental management.&#13;
Institutional Development&#13;
2.15  Shanghai's strategy for wastewater management includes phased strengthening of&#13;
the Shanghai Municipal Sewerage Company, Ltd. (SMSC) in parallel with physical&#13;
development of the system. SMSC was preceded by the Shanghai Sewerage Company&#13;
(SSC), which was established in 1987 under SSPI. SSC benefited from training under&#13;
that project but its organization required adjustment to allow effective management of the&#13;
expanding system needs; this led SMG to form SMSC (para. 4.1), absorbing SSC and&#13;
allocating enlarged responsibilities to the new organization. Based on an organizational&#13;
study carried out under the earlier project, SMSC has prepared an action plan for its&#13;
reorganization and further strengthening, which it would carry out with technical&#13;
assistance to be provided under the proposed project. The plan includes a focus on&#13;
furthering the company's commercialization by improving financial and accounting&#13;
capabilities. Details of SMSC's institutional objectives are given in Chapter 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Financial Strategy&#13;
2.16  Achieving financial sustainability of the wastewater system is critical to adequate&#13;
operation and maintenance of existing facilities and to the system expansion required to&#13;
support Shanghai's continued growth. SSPI introduced tariffs that now meet operating&#13;
and maintenance expenses (excluding depreciation). However, with only marginal tariff&#13;
increases during 1993-95 but wage and administrative cost increases of about 55 percent&#13;
and 46 percent a year, respectively, SSC had to rely on government transfers-&#13;
construction taxes and public utility levies (principally on water supply)-to meet&#13;
stormwater drainage and debt service costs. Recently, SMG signaled its intention to&#13;
press on towards making the system financially self-sustaining by approving substantially&#13;
increased wastewater tariffs in July 1995, which are scheduled for implementation from&#13;
March 1996. To meet Shanghai's financial targets for SMSC under the project would&#13;
require further tariff adjustments which, if implemented, would ensure continued&#13;
development of SMSC's financial capacity. SMSC's current and projected financial&#13;
performance is discussed further in Chapter 5.&#13;
D. WASTEWATER FLOWS AND POLLUTION LOADS&#13;
2.17  Wastewater flows and pollution loads to be handled by Shanghai's sewerage&#13;
system have been estimated based on parameters described in the following paragraphs.&#13;
Water Consumption and Wastewater Projections&#13;
2.18  Per capita water consumption in Shanghai rose from 79 liters per capita per day&#13;
(l/c/d) in 1984 to 118 l/c/d in 1992, which is considered reasonable for a wealthy city like&#13;
Shanghai. Average consumption by the year 2000 is expected to reach 160 I/c/d with&#13;
higher personal incomes, increasing use of water-consuming appliances, and the gradual&#13;
change from bucket latrines to flush toilets. However, the past growth rate of 6.0 percent&#13;
will likely slow to 2.5 to 3.5 percent by the year 2000, in response to water pricing policy&#13;
changes introduced as part of the ongoing SEP that are geared to providing a positive rate&#13;
of return on revalued assets.  Higher water charges should blunt demand and&#13;
consequently reduce wastewater flows. Per capita consumption levels are therefore&#13;
expected to rise from their year 2000 level to 225 l/c/d in 2010 and 280 l/c/d in 2020.&#13;
These growth rates are considered reasonable, given the current rate of economic growth.&#13;
2.19  Total wastewater flows in SMSC's service area now total about 5.5 million (M)&#13;
m 3/day (average dry weather flow). This includes 0.6 Mm3/d (11 percent) of wastewater&#13;
that is treated and discharged to local watercourses, 2.6 Mm3/d (48 percent of wastewater&#13;
conveyed and discharged to the Changjiang Estuary (without treatment), and 2.2 Mm3/d&#13;
(41 percent) of wastewater discharged to local watercourses without treatment.&#13;
Projections of wastewater flows show increases to 6.0 Mm3/d, 6.9 Mm3/d and 7.8 Mm3/d&#13;
in the years 2000, 2010 and 2020, respectively. Estimates are based on water supply&#13;
projections and include groundwater infiltration (estimated at 2,000 m3/d/km' in the Puxi&#13;
area and 1,000 m 3d/km in Pudong). Wastewater projections are shown in Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pollution Loads&#13;
2.20  Industry currently accounts for, and is projected to remain at, approximately&#13;
50 percent of the total wastewater flow in Shanghai in the year 2000. The pollution&#13;
loads, in terms of biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD),&#13;
ammonia and phosphorus, however, are dominated by those of domestic wastewater and&#13;
the significance of industry is much lower, accounting for 30 percent or less of the total&#13;
loads. This can be attributed to the particularly low strength of industrial wastewater as a&#13;
result of excessive water consumption per unit of output, and to the predominance of&#13;
industries based on inorganic materials, therefore discharging little if any organic matter&#13;
in wastewater.&#13;
2.21  Quantities of industrial wastewater are expected to decline initially, mainly as a&#13;
result of process improvements and moves to more water-efficient technology, and rise&#13;
slowly thereafter as a result of sustained growth in industrial output. However, the&#13;
growth in domestic loads consequent upon the phasing out of nightsoil and septic tank&#13;
systems will mean that the relative significance of industrial pollution loads will not&#13;
increase.&#13;
2.22  There are, however, a number of toxic and sparingly degradable substances of&#13;
industrial origin in Shanghai's wastewater. The principal substances include heavy&#13;
metals such as arsenic, copper, mercury, lead and zinc, cyanide and phenol.&#13;
2.23 The impact of the overall loads of BOD, COD, phosphorus and ammonia in the&#13;
context of the assimilative capacity of the Changjiang Estuary is limited (a "footprint" of&#13;
under 1 km2), particularly in the immediate term. Extensive modeling studies have&#13;
shown that predicted pollution loads up to the year 2000 can be fully assimilated; beyond&#13;
that time, manageable amounts of phosphorus should be removed as flows and loads&#13;
increase. This has been carefully analyzed during preparation of the Environmental&#13;
Assessment. It is proposed, therefore, to adopt a strict control policy for toxic substances,&#13;
based largely on control at source, but to adopt a total load approach in respect of organic&#13;
pollutants such as BOD. As mentioned above (para. 2.14), phosphorus is the limiting&#13;
pollutant, and phosphorus control would be the objective of the management strategy.&#13;
Pollution load projections are shown in Annex 2, and further background provided in&#13;
Annex 9.&#13;
2.24  As indicated previously, wastewater pretreatment facilities would be provided for&#13;
in the proposed project, and land would be reserved and provision made in the system&#13;
design for the future construction of further treatment as pollution loads increase. Phase I&#13;
investments under SSPI were designed to remove about 20 percent of the total urban&#13;
pollution load in the Huangpu, and Phase II investments under the proposed project&#13;
would aim to collect parts of the remaining loads. The rationale for this approach in&#13;
terms of compliance with discharge standards is discussed in detail in Annex 9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
E. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.25 There are three principal lessons learned from our lending in Shanghai and&#13;
elsewhere that have been incorporated into the project: (a) provision and management of&#13;
financially sustainable urban environmental services; (b) effective environmental&#13;
management and pollution control; and (c) the need for rigorous project preparation and&#13;
careful implementation.&#13;
2.26  Provision and Management of Urban Environmental Services.   The&#13;
Operations Evaluation Department review of Bank water and sanitation projects (Water&#13;
Supply and Sanitation Projects: The Bank Experience 1967-1989), concluded that to&#13;
meet borrower and Bank development objectives, project design should incorporate&#13;
institution building, financial viability, and poverty alleviation as core conceptual&#13;
elements. Bank municipal management sector work in connection with incentives for&#13;
urban service delivery emphasizes the need to properly assign functional responsibilities&#13;
and link revenue to expenditures. In China, environmental services are provided at the&#13;
municipal level, where a high percentage of government revenue is also captured. Recent&#13;
sector work (China. Urban Environmental Service Management) concluded that the&#13;
major failing in environmental services has been dependence on municipal budget&#13;
transfers to fund services, while greater reliance on user charges would be affordable,&#13;
induce resource conservation, and create a more dependable income stream. Increasing&#13;
tariffs has therefore been a focal point of our policy dialogue. Under the first Sewerage&#13;
Project, a conflict arose between SMG's desire to protect SSC's financial viability and&#13;
the political pressure on SMG to limit tariff increases in an inflationary environment.&#13;
Discussions during preparation of the proposed project highlighted the need for a&#13;
resolution of this conflict, and SMG approved a tariff increase in consequence prior to&#13;
appraisal for implementation commencing in 1996. This aspect of the project would be a&#13;
focal point for dialogue during implementation.&#13;
2.27 Effective Environmental Management and Pollution Control. Reviewing&#13;
recent Bank experience in pollution control including projects in China, Asia, Latin&#13;
America and Africa has highlighted the importance of facilitating the means for all&#13;
polluters to connect to wastewater systems, thereby expanding system coverage and the&#13;
numbers of paying consumers, and ensuring the cost-effective capture of all polluting&#13;
wastewaters. The project design draws on these lessons and those in the two recent sector&#13;
studies (China: Environmental Strategy Paper and China: Urban Environmental&#13;
Service Management). The latter stresses issues of political commitment especially with&#13;
respect to pricing matters, appropriate environmental standards and management&#13;
incntives, and monitoring and enforcement capabilities. This project also addresses those&#13;
issues through an action plan to enhance system connections, and strengthen wastewater&#13;
utility management. The ongoing Shanghai Environment Project includes important&#13;
supporting initiatives under implementation, which provide in-plant water pollution&#13;
reduction and treatment of the 33 major polluting industries (some 80 percent of the total&#13;
industrial wastewater pollution in Shanghai), implemented through an ongoing time-&#13;
bound Action Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.28  Project Preparation And Implementation.  The ongoing support from&#13;
international and Chinese expertise, with a focus on strong project management backed&#13;
by high-level political commitment to project goals has proved effective, and would be&#13;
repeated for project implementation. The extensive involvement of a local design bureau&#13;
during preparation is also expected to ensure a high degree of borrower ownership. The&#13;
importance of sustained technical assistance during initial stages of project&#13;
implementation was demonstrated in SSPI, for example, where technical problems&#13;
encountered during construction caused flooding and loss of one of two outfall tunnels&#13;
being constructed as part of the Phase I works. This underscored the need for the&#13;
proposed project to support technical assistance expertise in the areas of construction&#13;
management, financial and institutional systems development, and a technical review&#13;
panel.&#13;

3. THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The project is part of the next phase of Shanghai Municipality's development&#13;
program to improve environmental conditions and management. The overriding project&#13;
objective is to provide a safe environmental setting for the long-term growth of Shanghai,&#13;
enabling sustained economic and industrial growth. Specific objectives of the project are&#13;
to:&#13;
(a)   enhance wastewater and stormwater management through expanding&#13;
wastewater collection, pretreatment and disposal capacity and stormwater&#13;
drainage facilities;&#13;
(b)   reduce urban pollution impact, while facilitating pollution control;&#13;
(c)   improve wastewater utility financial and operational management; and&#13;
(d)   strengthen sector institutions through training, feasibility studies, and future&#13;
investment project preparation in the environment area.&#13;
B. PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
3.2   Recognizing the significant environmental damage that has been caused by&#13;
uncontrolled wastewater pollution in China, the Central Government has targeted&#13;
Shanghai to improve its environmental management. It therefore approached the World&#13;
Bank for support in funding a long-term program of investments in environmental&#13;
protection in Shanghai. SMG recognizes that the sustained protection of the environment&#13;
is a prerequisite for long-term economic growth and considers that appropriate&#13;
investments in environrmental protection are of the highest priority.&#13;
3.3   SMG directed the Shanghai Sewerage Project Construction Company-SSPCC&#13;
(paras. 3.13-3.14), which was set up to prepare and execute SSPI, to prepare and implement&#13;
the proposed project. SSPCC carried out these responsibilities until December 1995 when&#13;
it was merged with SSC to become the Shanghai Municipal Sewerage Company, Ltd.&#13;
(SMSC), which would now be responsible for completion of preparation and for project&#13;
implementation (para. 4.1). The Bank and bilateral agencies were approached for assistance&#13;
in funding project preparation. As a result, the Norwegian Government funded a major&#13;
Design Review and Advisory (DRA) consultancy to review the initial preparation work&#13;
already undertaken by SMG, and to assist in the completion of the remaining work&#13;
supporting SMG-appointed consultants. The French Government funded a consultancy to&#13;
review wastewater treatment, telemetry and improvements to SMSC's existing wastewater&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
treatment plants. Danish government-supported specialists were retained to review and&#13;
confirm the findings of modeling studies carried out by two Shanghai institutions on the&#13;
assimilative capacity of an outfall at Bailonggang, and Canadian government-supported&#13;
specialists assisted in developing wastewater connection options and strategies.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.4   The project would comprise (a) financial and policy initiatives, planning,&#13;
institutional and management reforms, and (b) an investment program of environmentally-&#13;
oriented capital works and institutional measures to support management and operational&#13;
capacity-building of SMSC. A detailed description of the various project components is&#13;
presented in Annex 3. A summary of these components is given below. The indicated&#13;
costs include physical and price contingencies, and local taxes and duties. The investment&#13;
program would comprise the following components:&#13;

training, feasibility studies and future project preparation. $18.9 million&#13;
TOTAL ESTIMATED PROJECT COST                     $633.3 million&#13;
3.5   The institutional development and policy strengthening component would&#13;
enhance policy formulation and operational experience in wastewater and water pollution&#13;
control. These initiatives have been grouped into three technical assistance packages-&#13;
Package A (institutional and financial), Package B (technical, environmental management&#13;
strengthening, and future project preparation), and Training-and would include:&#13;
(a)   assisting SMSC in its reorganization and institutional strengthening, and&#13;
developing utility accounting and management information systems&#13;
(Package A. I);&#13;
(b)   strengthening project management and sector institutions through technical&#13;
assistance and training for efficient project implementation (Package B.1);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
(c)      improving measures and mechanisms for water pollution monitoring, for the&#13;
enforcement of water pollution regulations, providing technical assistance&#13;

3.6      Total project costs, including contingencies, are estimated at Y 5,967.9 million&#13;
($633.3 million). The foreign exchange component is Y 1,953.0 million ($200.2&#13;
million), or about 32 percent of project costs. Local taxes and duties on items expected to&#13;
be imported directly for the project are estimated at Y 216.7 million ($21.3 million), or&#13;
about 3 percent of project costs. Land acquisition costs are estimated at Y 1.329.1&#13;
million ($153.6 million), or about 24 percent of project costs. A summary of cost&#13;
estimates is given in Table 3.1. Interest during construction is estimated at $34.6 million&#13;
and total financing required would be Y 6,307.3 million ($667.9 million). Detailed cost&#13;
estimates are provided in Annex 4.&#13;

3.7   The above estimates have been based on a 5.5-year implementation period, with&#13;
disbursement of the IBRD Loan spread over 6.5 years, consistent with the standard Bank&#13;
disbursement profile for urban projects in China. All financial analyses have been&#13;
performed using the 5.5-year implementation period. SMSC, however, plans to complete&#13;
implementation of the project in three years, by December 31, 1998.&#13;
3.8   Project cost estimates are based on local design institutes' and the DRA (para. 3.3)&#13;
consultants' engineering designs, reflecting price levels prevailing in December 1995. The&#13;
unit prices were derived through a reconciliation of data from the following principal&#13;
sources: (a) quotations obtained from manufacturers and suppliers; (b) prices of goods and&#13;
works from recent contracts under SEP; and (c) construction costs according to prices&#13;
published by the Government, adjusted for inflation. Physical contingencies of 10 percent&#13;
have been applied to base costs, except for the treatment and outfall works, where&#13;
15 percent has been applied. Price contingencies have been applied to expenditures at&#13;
projected global foreign and local inflation rates. In view of the large variation between&#13;
foreign and local price contingency projections, the dollar/yuan exchange rate has been&#13;
assumed to vary in order to maintain purchasing power parity. The projections used are as&#13;
follows:&#13;

3.10  China is eligible for single currency loans under the Bank's expanded program.&#13;
The Government of China and Shanghai Municipality have selected LIBOR-based US&#13;
dollar single currency loan terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the&#13;
foreign exchange risk of their borrowings by more closely matching the currency of their&#13;
liabilities with that of their net trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar-&#13;
denominated. They selected the LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full&#13;
maturity of the loan, compared to the fixed-rate option that would have resulted in a 15-&#13;
year loan. The Borrower judges that it can manage any interest rate risk. This loan&#13;
represents about 8 percent of the fiscal year 1996 IBRD expected lending to China, and is&#13;
well within the 50 percent volume guideline approved by the Bank's Board.&#13;
3.11  The IBRD loan would be made to the People's Republic of China. The loan of&#13;
$250 million would be for a 20-year term, including a 5-year grace period at the standard&#13;
interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans. The proceeds of the loan&#13;
would be onlent to Shanghai Municipality (SM) on the same terms and conditions, and a&#13;
commitment charge at the Bank's standard rate on the outstanding balance. SM would&#13;
bear the foreign exchange risk. These arrangements are satisfactory to the Bank. SM&#13;
would onlend the proceeds to SMSC for 15 years, including a 5-year grace period, at a&#13;
rate equal to the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans.&#13;
SMSC would bear the commitment charge and the foreign exchange risks. Assurances to&#13;
this effect were obtained during negotiations, andfound acceptable to the Bank&#13;
3.12 Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between SM and SMSC, satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, is a condition of loan effectiveness. A separate Project Agreement, including&#13;
operational, financial and monitoring covenants, would be executed between SM and&#13;
IBRD.&#13;
F. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.13 The Shanghai Municipal Sewerage Company, Ltd.-SMSC (para. 4.1) would&#13;
implement the project. SMSC was established and started operations on December 7,&#13;
1995, resulting from the merger of the Shanghai Sewerage Company (SSC) and the&#13;
Shanghai Sewerage Project Construction Company (SSPCC), established in November&#13;
1986 as a state-owned enterprise to prepare and execute SSPI. That project was executed&#13;
in a satisfactory manner. SMSC comes under, and reports to, the Shanghai Major&#13;
Construction Project Leading Group, which oversees the preparation and execution of all&#13;
major urban projects on behalf of SMG. The Leading Group is headed by a vice-mayor&#13;
and supported by the Vice Secretary-General of SMG and the Director of the Shanghai&#13;
Construction Commission (SCC) as group deputy leaders. Senior representatives from&#13;
the major government agencies concerned with urban services and environmental&#13;
management also support the Leading Group.&#13;
3.14  The organization of SMSC's Construction Department is shown in Annex 5. The&#13;
Department, with a total staff strength of about 260, has been organized and staffed to&#13;
prepare and execute the project, including undertaking the supervision and monitoring of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
contracts, maintenance of records, and preparation of implementation progress reports. It&#13;
has interacted well with the DRA consultants (para. 3.3), resulting in the proposed project&#13;
having been prepared satisfactorily to date. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that SMG would ensure that SMSC would be maintained throughout the project&#13;
period with staffing and functions satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
3.15  Day-to-day construction management services and supervision would be provided&#13;
by local consulting engineers, assisted by international consultants engaged through&#13;
SMSC (Technical Assistance Package B. 1). The consultants' duties would include&#13;
verification of compliance with specifications for works and goods, supervision of&#13;
construction, quality assurance of construction materials and major items of plant and&#13;
equipment, testing and commissioning of completed works and advice on training of staff&#13;
to operate the completed facilities.&#13;
G. STATUS OF PROJECT ANALYSIS AND ENGINEERING&#13;
3.16  Project preparation and design work has been undertaken for SMG jointly by&#13;
international and local consultants and design bureaus (para. 3.3) to a high standard, and&#13;
is well advanced. Work on the final design and bidding documents preparation for the&#13;
wastewater conveyor system was completed in 1995. For the remaining components of&#13;
the project, this work is scheduled to be completed during 1996.&#13;
H. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.17  Procurement procedures and arrangements satisfactory to the World Bank were&#13;
agreed with SMG. All procurement activities would be organized through the Shanghai&#13;
International Trust and Investment Company (SITICO), and the International Tendering&#13;
Company of Beijing (ITC), who have been appointed procurement agents by SMSC for the&#13;
project. Both companies are experienced and competent procurement agents that are&#13;
familiar with, and have recent and relevant experience in international competitive bidding&#13;
(ICB) work on World Bank Group-financed projects. The tender documents to be used in&#13;
the project would be based on the model bid documents that were prepared by the Ministry&#13;
of Finance and approved by the World Bank Group. All works and goods would be&#13;
packaged whenever practicable into packages of over $10 million for works and over&#13;
$250,000 for goods, to attract international competition. Prequalification of bidders would&#13;
be undertaken for civil works contracts for pump stations and Bailonggang wastewater&#13;
treatmnent plant with an estimated value over $12.0 million each, and for goods contracts for&#13;
the supply and installation of pumping plant and system telemetry equipment with an&#13;
estimated value over $4.0 million each. Annex 6 lists the Schedule of Contract Packages&#13;
and the metlhod of procurement, and Table 3.3 summarizes the procurement categories and&#13;
the expected procurement methods. The contract packages and the method of procurement&#13;
have been agreed with SMSC.&#13;

Note: Figures in parenthesis are amounts to be financed by the Bank.&#13;
3.18 Civil Works. There is a total of about $268 million of civil works, of which about&#13;
$168 million (63 percent) would be procured using ICB procedures. Qualified domestic&#13;
contractors under ICB will be eligible for a 7.5 percent preference in bid evaluation, in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines-January 1995. ICB procedures&#13;
would be used for all civil works contracts of estimated value over $10.0 million (about&#13;
nine contracts). All remaining civil works are too small, scattered or scheduled too far apart&#13;
to be packaged to be of interest to foreign firms. Of the remaining works, about $91 million&#13;
would be awarded through national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. The NCB procedures recently promulgated by the Government have been&#13;
reviewed and found to be satisfactory to the Bank. Interested foreign bidders would be&#13;
allowed to bid for NCB contracts.&#13;
3.19  Equipment and Materials. There is a total of about $128 million of equipment&#13;
and materials in the project, of which about $104 million (81 percent) would be procured&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
using ICB procedures. Qualified domestic bidders will be eligible for a preference in bid&#13;
evaluation of 15 percent or customs duties and import tax payable by a nonexempt&#13;
importer, whichever is less. All equipment and materials with individual contract values of&#13;
$250,000 or more equivalent would be procured using ICB procedures. Equipment and&#13;
materials with individual contract values less than $250,000 equivalent up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of about $7.8 million would be awarded using NCB procedures, acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Contracts costing $50,000 equivalent or less, up to an aggregate amount of $0.8&#13;
million, would be procured through national shopping procedures with at least three price&#13;
quotations. Service contracts for model and pilot plant testing would be procured through&#13;
national shopping.&#13;
3.20  Direct Contracting. Direct contracting (not Bank-financed) anounting to about&#13;
$25.3 million will be used for: contracts to be made with the local power companies to&#13;
provide electricity supplies to the pump stations, buildings and facilities under the project,&#13;
for utility services diversions and protection, and the provision of small tools.&#13;
3.21  Technical Assistance and Training. All consultants to be retained under the&#13;
project would be recruited in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency-&#13;
August 1981." National consultants and counterpart staff would be engaged or assigned by&#13;
SMSC and the concerned agencies of SMG. Consultants have already been retained for:&#13;
(a) project preparation and design; (b) strengthening of the organization of SMSC,&#13;
including financial and management improvements, and management information&#13;
systems improvements proposed under the project (Package A.1); and (c) the construction&#13;
management and supervision of works to be constructed under the project (Package B.1).&#13;
The terms of reference for Packages A. 1 and B. I are in the project file (see Annex17).&#13;
3.22 Review of Bid Documents and Contracts. All civil works packages (about 12&#13;
contracts, 70 percent of the works) of $6 million or more, and all equipment and materials&#13;
contracts (about 14 contracts, 81 percent of the equipment and materials) of $500,000 or&#13;
more, would be subject to the Bank's nornal prior review, including prequalification, notice&#13;
of invitation to bid, bid documents, bid evaluation and contracts. The threshold for prior&#13;
review of contracts for consultants would be $100,000 equivalent for firms and $50,000 for&#13;
individual contracts, including letters of invitation, terms of reference, evaluation of&#13;
proposals and contracts. Other contracts would be subject to selective post-award review.&#13;
An estimated 75 percent of the total value of contracts proposed to be financed by the Bank&#13;
would be subject to prior review.&#13;
3.23  Prequalification.  The Standard Prequalification Document for the People's&#13;
Republic of China, issued by the Ministry of Finance and approved by the World Bank&#13;
Group, would be used for preparing the invitation document. SMSC, SITICO and ITC hold&#13;
copies of this document (together with model bidding documents for ICB and NCB works&#13;
and goods invitations, prepared in consultation with the Bank).&#13;
&#13;

I. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.24 The proposed loan of $250 million would be disbursed over a period of about six&#13;
and a half years, as follows:&#13;
1.   Civil Works              $135.0 million   56 percent of expenditures&#13;
2.   Materials &amp; Equipment    $ 80.0 million   100 percent of foreign expendi-&#13;
tures, 100 percent of local expen-&#13;
ditures (ex-factory cost), and&#13;
75 percent of local expenditures&#13;
for other items procured locally&#13;
3 .   Construction Management   $ 6.5 million   100 percent of expenditures&#13;
Services&#13;
4.   Institutional Development   $ 16.0 million   100 percent of expenditures&#13;
and Training&#13;
5.   Unallocated              $ 12.5 million&#13;
Tot31                 $250.0 million&#13;
3.25  To expedite disbursements, a Special Account with an authorized allocation of&#13;
$15.0 million, representing about four months' average disbursements, would be&#13;
established. It would be replenished monthly or whenever the Special Account is drawn&#13;
down to 50 percent of its initial value, whichever occurs first. Disbursements would be&#13;
made against statements of expenditure (SOEs), certified by SMSC, for: (a) contracts for&#13;
civil works costing less than $6 million; (b) contracts for equipment and materials costing&#13;
less than $500,000 equivalent; (c) contracts for consulting services costing less than&#13;
$100,000 equivalent for firms and $50,000 equivalent for individuals; and (d) all training.&#13;
Documents supporting SOEs would be retained by SMSC and made available for review&#13;
by external auditors and Bank supervision missions. Disbursements for all other&#13;
expenditures would be based on full documentation. A Schedule of Disbursements is&#13;
given in Annx 7. As an early start is expected to be made by SM on some works,&#13;
retroactive financing of up to $5.0 million would be provided for eligible expenditures&#13;
incurred after August 1, 1995 but prior to loan signing, covering initial civil works, goods&#13;
and services contracts. The project is expected to be completed about December 2001&#13;
and, therefore, the Loan Closing Date would be June 30, 2002.&#13;
J. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
3.26  Project Impacts. The project entails acquisition of land and resettlement of&#13;
affected persons. During project preparation, a detailed survey of affected persons and&#13;
properties was carried out by SSPCC with the assistance of local township and district&#13;
governments and the affected people. According to the results of the survey, permanent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
land acquisition of 188 ha of land would be necessary for the project and 114 ha would&#13;
need to be leased temporarily during project construction. A total of 4,924 persons would&#13;
be affected by land acquisition and 4,018 persons would need house relocation as a result&#13;
of the project.  Of these, 1,516 would be affected by both land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement, hence the total number of persons affected by the project due to land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement would be 7,426. A total of 173 enterprises would also be&#13;
affected by the project, of which 21 would need to be relocated to new sites. The&#13;
Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences (SASS) also conducted a preliminary&#13;
socioeconomic survey of the affected people. Detailed baseline socioeconomic surveys&#13;
of affected persons would be carried out for each contract, before the initiation of&#13;
resettlement implementation for the respective contract&#13;
3.27  Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). In order to mitigate the adverse impacts of&#13;
land acquisition and also to implement the resettlement/rehabilitation activities as a&#13;
development program, a comprehensive strategy and practical framework for&#13;
implementation was prepared by SMG and SSPCC; these are described in a Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan (RAP), which was prepared by SSPCC and submitted to the Bank for review&#13;
prior to appraisal, and found to be satisfactory following minor revisions. The RAP&#13;
consists of: (a) the objective and principles of resettlement; (b) legal framework and&#13;
resettlement  policies;  (c) institutional  arrangements;  (d) costs  and   budget;&#13;
(e) implementation schedule; (f) participation and consultations with affected persons;&#13;
(g) grievance redressal mechanisms; and (h) monitoring and evaluation of RAP&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.28  Resettlement Strategy.  All persons affected by land acquisition would be&#13;
provided jobs in nonagricultural enterprises. The elderly affected persons would be&#13;
eligible for old-age pension and special rehabilitation arrangements. Affected enterprises&#13;
would be compensated at full replacement cost of structures affected and those&#13;
substantially affected would be relocated to sites in the vicinity. Those affected by house&#13;
relocation would be given options of various types of housing (described in detail in the&#13;
RAP). Workers in affected enterprises would be given allowances in lieu of wages&#13;
during the period when enterprises are not working.&#13;
3.29  Resettlement Costs. The costs associated with RAP implementation have been&#13;
included in the project budget. The total cost of implementation is estimated at Y 1,329.1&#13;
million, including provisions for physical and price contingencies.&#13;
3.30  Implementation Arrangements.   SMG  has given the responsibility for&#13;
resettlement planning, financing and coordination and implementation to SMSC.&#13;
Implementation would be carried out with assistance from local government institutions&#13;
at the SMG, township (Pudong) and district (Puxi) level. Specialized agencies dealing&#13;
with land acquisition and resettlement and placement of labor in new jobs have been&#13;
formed by SMG for Pudong new area. A Resettlement Coordination Group (RCG), with&#13;
members from various agencies involved in land acquisition and resettlement activities,&#13;
has been formed specifically for the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
3.31  RAP implementation would be carried out in a highly participatory manner;&#13;
affected people and their representatives have been and would be consulted at each stage&#13;
in RAP planning and implementation. Avenues for redressing grievances of affected&#13;
persons have been established specifically for the project; provisions for appeals are also&#13;
in place.&#13;
3.32  Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation program would be carried out both internally and externally. Internal&#13;
monitoring would be carried out by SMSC bimonthly on the basis of detailed formats that&#13;
have been agreed with the World Bank and included in the RAP; monitoring indicators&#13;
have also been specified. The RCG would take follow-up action on the findings of&#13;
internal monitoring. External monitoring and evaluation would be carried out by SASS,&#13;
during and after project completion, concentrating on qualitative aspects of RAP&#13;
implementation.  Monitoring reports would be prepared every three months and&#13;
submitted to the Bank every six months. The first external monitoring report would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank by end-June 1996. The monitoring reports would be discussed in&#13;
the RCG and each report would record the progress of follow-up actions initiated as a&#13;
result of the previous reports.&#13;
3.33  A Resettlement Action Plan, acceptable to the Bank, has been received. A&#13;
summary of the RAP is presented in Annex 8. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained from SM that it would cause SMSC and all other concerned agencies to (a) carry&#13;
out the resettlement of'persons affected by the project in a manner and according to a plan&#13;
(the RAP) that is satisfactory to the Bank; (b) report annually on the progress in carrying&#13;
out the resettlement plan using monitoring indicators satisfactory to the Bank; and (c) carry&#13;
out land acquisition in accordance with the RAP.&#13;
K. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.34  The project is a Category A project according to the Bank's Operational Directive&#13;
classification. SSPCC, through its consultants, prepared the Environmental Assessment&#13;
(EA) in accordance with Bank requirements, which was extensively reviewed within China,&#13;
and approved by NEPA. The EA incorporates assessment of possible impacts on local&#13;
water (improvements in water quality in the Huangpu and its tributaries) and land, and on&#13;
environmental quality in the Changjiang estuary. The EA concludes that the project would&#13;
have an overall substantially positive environmental impact.  Detailed mathematical&#13;
computer modeling studies have determined the optimal discharge location, the assimilative&#13;
capacity of the Changjiang at the proposed outfall location, and the wastewater treatment&#13;
strategy and phasing requirements. An issue of particular concern is the phosphorus load&#13;
carried by the Changjiang, which has implications for red tides in the East China Sea/&#13;
Hangzhou Bay.&#13;
3.35  These studies concluded that, initially, simple pretreatment would be adequate to&#13;
avoid unacceptable impact upon water quality in the Changjiang. As pollution loads build&#13;
up, wastewater treatment would be phased in, probably adopting chemically-assisted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
primary treatment.  A key objective of treatment would be to control the loads of&#13;
phosphorus discharged to the Changjiang from Shanghai, which would be sustained at or&#13;
below the predicted loads discharged in 2005. This will be achieved by introduction of&#13;
treatment by not later than that year.&#13;
3.36  To maximize treatment efficiency, the required pollution load reduction would be&#13;
achieved by treatment of part of the wastewater flow to a high standard. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained from SMG that SMSC would provide wastewater&#13;
treatment facilities for the SSPII wastewater as required to limit the average annual&#13;
phosphorus loads from Shanghai as a whole into any receiving waters at or below 18 tons!&#13;
day. The first treatment plant would be designed on the basis of experience with the pilot&#13;
plant and in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to be located at&#13;
Bailonggang, and would be constructed and fully operational not later than January 1,&#13;
2005, or such other date that the Bank and Shanghai may agree. The capacity would need&#13;
to be extended to an estimated 1.7 Mm3/d in 2010, and 2.2 Mm3/d in 2015. As treatment is&#13;
introduced, considerable quantities of sludge would be generated; feasibility studies for the&#13;
future treatment requirements and plans for sludge disposal have been completed, and&#13;
preliminary design is underway for works that would be phased in over time.&#13;
3.37  Ensuring wastewater flows are collected into the new and existing system is crucial&#13;
to both project impact and the long-term financial sustainability of the Shanghai wastewater&#13;
system. The enhanced collection of wastewater to the Phase I system and connections to&#13;
the new system to be constructed under the project will be undertaken in accordance with a&#13;
Wastewater Connection time-bound Action Plan. This would include the construction and&#13;
commissioning of pump stations and secondary sewers in the Pudong area, and linking the&#13;
project to ongoing in-plant pollution control programs (supported under SEP). Shanghai&#13;
has an ongoing Water Conservation Program, with strong public-outreach activities and&#13;
publicity campaign. The Wastewater Connection Action Plan would be implemented&#13;
integrally with this latter program. At negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom SMG&#13;
that SMSC wvould implement the Wastewater Connection Action Plan, discuss any revisions&#13;
with the Bank, and implement any such agreed revisions.&#13;
3.38 A comprehensive summary of the EA is given in Annex 9.&#13;
L. PROJECT MONITORING, REPORTING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.39  The proposed project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 10. Project&#13;
impact would be monitored with respect to the objectives, for which the key indicators are&#13;
summarized below:&#13;
(a)   wastewater management:&#13;
Indicators: customers, system connections, loads and flows;&#13;
(b)   urban pollution impact reduction:&#13;
Indicators:  licenses performance, Huangpu River quality, outfall&#13;
performance (mixing area);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(c)   operational and financial performance:&#13;
Indicators: financial parameters, operational efficiency; and&#13;
(d)   institutional development and project management:&#13;
Indicators: % achievement of two time-bound Action Plans, % of project&#13;
implementation plan.&#13;
A tentative list of proposed monitoring indicators for environmental improvement is&#13;
included in Annex I 1. Financial monitoring indicators for SMSC are appended to its&#13;
financial projections in Annex 13. The format and content ofproject progress reports and&#13;
project impact monitoring indicators and methodology were discussed and confirmed&#13;
during negotiations, and an understanding reached that parameters, baseline and targeted&#13;
values would be developed by SMSC for review during the proposed Project Launch&#13;
Workshop (para. 3.41).&#13;
3.40  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that quarterly project progress&#13;
reports would be prepared by SMSC and sent to the Bank commencing April 1996. The&#13;
last progress report of each year would include the latest project cost estimate and financing&#13;
plan for the following year, including SM's draft budget for local counterpart funds. An&#13;
understanding to that effect was reached during negotiations, and recorded in the minutes&#13;
of negotiations. An implementation completion report, reviewing the planned objectives&#13;
and the achievements of the project, including costs and benefits derived, and performance&#13;
and contribution of all parties associated with project execution, would be prepared by SM&#13;
and submitted to the Bank within six months of the Closing Date. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained that, not later than six months after the closing date, or such&#13;
later date as may be agreed between SM and the Bank SM would cause SMSC to:&#13;
(a) prepare and submit to the Bank an outline plan for the future operation of the&#13;
investments financed under the project; and (b) afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to&#13;
exchange views on the said outline plan.&#13;
3.41  To facilitate implementation, a Project Launch Workshop would be held in early&#13;
1996. Project supervision requirements would be based on experience with the supervision&#13;
of SSPI. Bank supervision would require about 108 staff-weeks over the life of the project,&#13;
of which about 30 staff-weeks would be at headquarters for the review of progress and audit&#13;
reports, procurement actions and correspondence, and 78 staff-weeks would be in the field.&#13;
More extensive supervision would be required during the first three years of the project&#13;
during which time the technical assistance would be made operational and many contracts&#13;
would be tendered, evaluated and awarded.  Supervision would be provided by&#13;
environmental engineering and financial staff, as well as other specialists as needed. The&#13;
project supervision plan is shown in Annex 16.&#13;

4. THE BENEFICIARY&#13;
A. THE SHANGHAI MUNICIPAL SEWERAGE COMPANY, LTD.&#13;
4.1    Organization. The Shanghai Municipal Sewerage Company, Ltd. (SMSC) was&#13;
established as a self-accounting, self-funding state-owned enterprise under SM, and started&#13;
operations on December 7, 1995, following the merger of the existing Shanghai Sewerage&#13;
Company (SSC) and the Shanghai Sewerage Project Construction Company (SSPCC). The&#13;
establishment of SMSC represents the second step in SMG's plans to reorganize and&#13;
strengthen institutional arrangements for the delivery of efficient wastewater management&#13;
services in Shanghai. At the first step, SSC was established in 1987 as a self-accounting,&#13;
self-funding state-owned enterprise, to be responsible for sewerage and stormwater&#13;
collection, treatment (as required) and disposal in the following 14 urban districts of the&#13;
Shanghai Municipality: Baoshan, Changning Hongkou, Huangpu, Jiading, Jing'an, Luwan,&#13;
Minhang, Nansi, Pudong, Putuo, Xuhui, Yangpu and Zhabei. Its service area comprised&#13;
about 750 kM2, approximately the same as that of the Shanghai Municipal Waterworks&#13;
Company (SMWC). Its registration in accordance with the Registration Regulations was a&#13;
condition of effectiveness of the First Shanghai Sewerage Project-SSPI (Loan 2794-&#13;
CHA/Credit 1779-CHA). SSPCC was established in November 1986 as a state-owned&#13;
enterprise, to prepare and execute SSPI.&#13;
4.2   SSC evolved from the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Administration Bureau&#13;
(SMEAB), under which two divisions, the Shanghai Municipal Drainage Administration&#13;
Division (SMDAD) and the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Administration Division&#13;
(SMEAD), were responsible for sewage pumping stations and sewage treatment works, and&#13;
sanitary and combined sewers, respectively. SMEAD is also responsible for maintenance&#13;
of urban roads and bridges. Nightsoil (and solid waste) collection and disposal is handled&#13;
by the Shanghai Environmental Sanitation Administration Bureau (SESAB).&#13;
4.3   SMSC, whose parent bureau is the Shanghai Public Utility Bureau, which comes&#13;
under the Shanghai Construction Commission, is headed by a General Manager appointed&#13;
by a Board of Directors comprising representatives of the Shanghai Construction&#13;
Commission, Shanghai Planning Commission, Shanghai Finance Bureau, Shanghai Price&#13;
Bureau and SMEAB. The General Manager is assisted by four vice-managers responsible&#13;
for: (a) administration, (b) finance, (c) operations, and (d) construction. Total staff strength&#13;
is about 4,100.&#13;
4.4   Until it was reorganized in November 1995, the structure of SSC had undergone&#13;
little change since it was established in 1987. It was a relatively flat-structured organization&#13;
with about 36 units (18 Divisions at Headquarters, and 18 Business Units, e.g., tariff, repair&#13;
and maintenance, monitoring, flood control stations, etc.) reporting to the Director's Office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
One of these units was the Combined Sewerage Management Division, formed about two&#13;
years ago, with a strength of about 590 staff. The purpose of this Division was to operate&#13;
the assets constructed under SSPI. These assets were formally handed over to SSC for&#13;
operation and maintenance in April 1995. Some functional tasks were shared between a&#13;
number of divisions, leading to duplication of effort and a waste of resources. Within some&#13;
Business Units, there was no clear distinction between operational and nonoperational&#13;
functions. Other areas were functionally weak including accounting and financial planning&#13;
(paras. 4.6 and 4.8).&#13;
4.5    With the exception of the five formal Development Zones in Pudong and other&#13;
designated estates (e.g., industrial, housing, etc.), SMSC's responsibilities include&#13;
ownership, operation and maintenance of all combined (storm and wastewater) sewers in its&#13;
service area, and wastewater sewers only in areas that have separate storm and wastewater&#13;
systems. The ownership, operation and maintenance of the separate storm and wastewater&#13;
systems in the five formal Development Zones of Pudong, and the sewerage and storm&#13;
network within certain estate holdings, vest with the respective administrations of those&#13;
zones and estates as the initial investments were made by them. SSC delegated the&#13;
mainitenance of some of its network to other organizations. In the Puxi area of Shanghai,&#13;
for instance, SMEAD maintained the link sewers. Branches of SMEAD in each district,&#13;
known as Municipal Engineering Administration Sectors, maintained the secondary and&#13;
tertiary network. Pump stations and link sewers in Baoshan and Chuansha counties were&#13;
financed and operated by SSC with staff appointed by the county governments.&#13;
4.6   Accounting, Billing and Collection. SSC and SSPCC's accounting system has&#13;
historically been cash-based bookkeeping, modeled more on the lines of its parent&#13;
government bureau, rather than on enterprise lines. Initial steps were taken during the first&#13;
project to move to enterprise accounting. As structured, SSC found that it was unable to&#13;
respond to the pace of development that has taken place, or that is expected to take place in&#13;
Shanghai during the next few years; for example, it was unable to identify all possible&#13;
nondomestic units that are connected to its reticulation system. With the establishment of&#13;
the new development zones in Pudong District, all sewers, pump stations, and connections&#13;
to the trunk sewer system, belong to the development zones, which precluded SSC from&#13;
establishing the identity of the nondomestic users in these zones. In other respects, the city&#13;
appears to have expanded too quickly for the agencies concerned to maintain up-to-date&#13;
commercial/industrial customer data bases. The above has resulted in a loss of revenue for&#13;
SSC, requiring increased transfers from SMG to sustain its operations; further, some&#13;
industries have their own source of water supply, but discharge to sewers without paying&#13;
charges.&#13;
4.7   SMG recognize that effective sewerage services in the Shanghai urban area can be&#13;
sustained only if these functions are reorganized and strengthened, and agencies given clear&#13;
lines of responsibility. The strategy for achieving this, which included the formation of&#13;
SMSC, is discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
B. ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS&#13;
4.8   As part of SSPI, an organizational study was commissioned by SMG, and&#13;
completed in October 1992. The study's recommendations, which were accepted by SMG,&#13;
called for a more responsive and rational structure for the then SSC in order to improve its&#13;
operational effectiveness, and prepare that company for the additional responsibilities&#13;
envisaged under the proposed project and beyond. These included: (a) reducing the span of&#13;
control of top management by developing an organization structure based on a pyramid;&#13;
(b) grouping of support services in a more rational way; (c) strengthening centralized&#13;
planning and management functions; (d) clearly separating operational and nonoperational&#13;
functions; (e) improving management accounting; (f) improving financial planning,&#13;
management and control functions; (g) developing medium and long-term planning in line&#13;
with corporate objectives; (h) improving the coordination of the technical divisions;&#13;
(i) developing the training function to include management training; (j) improving the&#13;
coordination of commnunity functions; and (k) rationalizing the management functions in the&#13;
business units, thereby reducing the duplication between business units and headquarters&#13;
staff.&#13;
4.9  In recognition of the need to strengthen its wastewater sector operations and put in&#13;
place an organization to effectively manage the already large wastewater assets in place and&#13;
those to be constructed under the project, SMG merged its two leading sector institutions-&#13;
SSC and SSPCC-creating SMSC (para. 4.1). SMSC's organizational structure, which&#13;
was modeled on recommendations included in the above-mentioned study, is shown in&#13;
Annex 12. Prior to negotiations, the Bank received conformed copies of the Charter and&#13;
Business License of SMSC. SMG has also prepared a strategy and time-bound Institutional&#13;
Development and Training Action Plan, acceptable to the Bank, for the further&#13;
strengthening of SMSC. Under the Action Plan, SMSC would principally (a) rationalize&#13;
management functions, (b) strengthen operations and finance, (c) enhance customer and&#13;
community contact, and (d) strengthen planning. Assurances were obtained during&#13;
negotiations that SMG would cause SMSC to implement the Institutional Development and&#13;
Training Action Plan, revise the Plan as necessary, discuss any revisions with the Bank&#13;
and implement any such agreed revisions.&#13;
4.10  SMSC has begun to implement some of the changes necessary to improve its&#13;
organizational and managerial capability. It has also retained consultants to help it&#13;
implement the necessary remaining changes (para. 3.21). The Institutional Development&#13;
and Training component of the project includes technical assistance and training to SMSC&#13;
to assist in the development of an enhanced management information system, appropriate&#13;
managerial and financial accounting systems, including billing and collection systems, and&#13;
pricing policies (see Annex 3). The technical assistance would be supplemented by a&#13;
number of study tours to comparable major utilities by senior managers and SMG officials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
C. ACCOUNTING&#13;
4.11  Different accounting systems are used by enterprises (autonomous units),&#13;
construction units (which execute investment projects) and local government departments,&#13;
in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
4.12  Enterprise Accounting. Historically, the accounting framework in China was&#13;
developed in the context of a centralized planned economy. With a view to complementing&#13;
the ongoing efforts to deepen reforms in the financial sector and enterprise management, the&#13;
accounting system in China needed modernization to permit satisfactory financial&#13;
management in an increasingly decentralized and market-oriented environment.  To&#13;
facilitate these economic reforms, China has decided that all state-owned enterprises should&#13;
follow a unified enterprise accounting system on an accrual basis. As a first step, the&#13;
general principles of enterprise accounting (the term to include public utilities such as water&#13;
and wastewater companies including SMSC) were revised by the Ministry of Finance from&#13;
July 1, 1993 to be more consistent with internationally generally accepted accounting&#13;
practice. As part of the reforms, enterprises are also required to produce five reports for&#13;
submission to Government: balance sheet, income statement, source and application of&#13;
funds, profit distribution, and details of main business. The first two reports are required to&#13;
be produced monthly, the remainder on an annual basis. This process is now under way in&#13;
SMSC. Resources and expenditures relating to the implementation of the project would be&#13;
identified separately within SMSC's accounts and financial statements.&#13;
4.13  Government Accounting. The regular government department accounts reflect&#13;
expenditures incurred against budget allocations by SM. Accounting is handled in a&#13;
decentralized manner through transfers to subunits from which actual expenditures are&#13;
made and recorded on a cash basis. Accounts are kept at all levels, and each subunit reflects&#13;
in its accounts the budget allocation it receives from the unit above.&#13;
D. AUDITS&#13;
4.14  As with other Bank Group-financed projects in China, the Foreign Investment Audit&#13;
Bureau of the State Audit Administration (SAA), established in 1983, would have overall&#13;
responsibility for auditing accounts concerning the project. The actual auditing work would&#13;
be conducted by the Shanghai Municipal Audit Department under SAA's supervision. This&#13;
arrangement is satisfactory. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the&#13;
following annual audits would be submitted to the Bank within six months after the end of&#13;
thefinancial year: (a) audit of the Special Account; (b) audit of statements of expenditures;&#13;
and (c) audit of the financial statements of SMSC.&#13;
E. STAFF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
4.15  The Institutional Development and Training component includes comprehensive&#13;
training initiatives for SMSC staff. The reorganization and strengthening of SMSC would&#13;
require the application of modern management methods underpinned by sound&#13;
management information systems. Senior and junior management would need training in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
modem management practices, and particularly in interpreting the output from financial&#13;
and management information systems. The development of appropriate accounting and&#13;
management information systems, including billing and collection procedures, would be&#13;
achieved by supporting the acquisition and initial operation of such systems, coupled with&#13;
training to selected staff.  Technical assistance would also be provided for the&#13;
development of an equitable sewerage tariff structure that would enable SMSC to meet its&#13;
financial objectives, and be affordable to all users, including the lower-income groups.&#13;
4.16  There is a perceived shortage of skilled mechanical engineers who have up-to-date&#13;
knowledge of the latest technical requirements in pumping techniques and the capability to&#13;
advise on design criteria for pumping stations. This deficiency can best be remedied&#13;
through seconding suitably qualified mechanical engineers to a major pump manufacturer.&#13;
On-the-job training of staff in the operation and maintenance of sewerage services is also&#13;
needed. This would be achieved by including support for SMSC's existing training center&#13;
with equipment and other teaching material. The training program is estimated to cost $1.1&#13;
million. Details are provided in Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. PAST AND CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION&#13;
5.1   Two years-1993 and 1994-of historic financial statements of SMSC2 have been&#13;
compiled from audited accounts (Annex13). As indicated earlier, the accounts are largely&#13;
cash-based, with, for instance, domestic sewerage revenues collected by SMWC on behalf&#13;
of SMSC being handed over only after the end of the fiscal year. They are not, therefore,&#13;
included in the financial year in which they accrue. Other features of SMSC's accounts&#13;
include (a) 99 percent of sewerage revenue being paid over to government, to be returned as&#13;
budgetary allocations to cover expenses; (b) residual surpluses, which represent the excess&#13;
of operating subsidies over costs, which are intended to repay loan interest, not accounted&#13;
for as an expense in the accounts; (c) depreciation charged for the first time in 1991; and&#13;
(d) costs of sewer maintenance by SMEAD being funded by SMEAB, which provided&#13;
SMSC with a corresponding income amount in payment of the work as the sewers form&#13;
part of SMSC's fixed asset base. In financial terms, therefore, SMSC is still in a&#13;
transitional phase to becoming a self-accounting, self-funding state-owned enterprise.&#13;
5.2   Recent levels of direct wastewater service charges, which, between 1993 and 1995,&#13;
increased only marginally, have not covered the costs of providing the service. Wages and&#13;
administration costs increased by about 55 percent and 46 percent a year, respectively.&#13;
SMG has, therefore, been allocating construction taxes and other city-generated revenues&#13;
(75 percent of required revenues came from these indirect sources in 1994, compared to&#13;
67 percent in 1993, and 57 percent in 1992) to meet operational and debt service costs, and&#13;
to be in compliance with its financial covenants under SSPI.  SMG has restated its&#13;
commitment to applying the "polluter pays" policy, and in support of that commitment,&#13;
raised the average sewerage tariff 100 percent for implementation from March 1996 (see&#13;
para. 5.11).&#13;
5.3   For the reasons stated in para. 4.6, SMSC has been unable to collect all potential&#13;
revenues from its sewerage operations. It is, however, in the process of updating its&#13;
customer data base of the nondomestic sector with information supplied by the SMWC, and&#13;
in addition, has pursued the following initiatives: (a) the development of regulations&#13;
requiring enterprises and units to connect to the wastewater system if within a certain&#13;
distance of a sewer line; (b) amendment to the SMG directive Document No. 116 through&#13;
Document No. 199 of October 14, 1995, which allows for sewerage billing and collection&#13;
from nondomestic units located within the formal development zones of Pudong; and&#13;
2 SMSC took over all of the assets and liabilities of SSC in November 1995. References in the text to&#13;
SMSC's historic accounts therefore imply SSC's accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33 -&#13;
(c) revision of the penalties for overstandard discharge to sewers. SMSC and SMWC also&#13;
recently reached agreement on joint billing arrangements for domestic consumers,&#13;
permitting the joint billing and collection of the enhanced tariff introduced on January 1,&#13;
1996.  This arrangement represents a significant step forward in organizational&#13;
development.&#13;
5.4   A formal revaluation of SMSC's fixed assets is underway and expected to be&#13;
completed by December 1996; this would include revaluation, as necessary, of assets&#13;
constructed under SSPI, and additional sewer networks constructed by SMEAD. The&#13;
aggregate of the revalued assets would then be incorporated into SMSC's accounts.&#13;
5.5   During negotiations, an understanding was reached and recorded in the minutes&#13;
of negotiations that SMG would (a) arrange to transfer to SMSC quarterly (i) the&#13;
proceeds of the 5 percent public utility additional tax collected by SMWC on its water&#13;
bills; and (ii) one quarter of SMSC's annual estimate as approved by SMG of the&#13;
stormwater operations and maintenance costs; and (b) cause SMWC to provide to SMSC&#13;
not less than biannually copies of its nondomestic consumer data base and corresponding&#13;
volume sales data.&#13;
B. FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES&#13;
5.6   In mandating the reorganization and strengthening of SMSC, SMG recognizes that&#13;
sustained sewerage operations in Shanghai can best be achieved if SMSC is allowed to&#13;
function as a public utility company whose customers should be charged towards paying the&#13;
full economic cost of the service. This approach would be consistent also with China's and&#13;
SMG's policy of "the Polluter Pays." Financial objectives under the project would provide&#13;
for wastewater revenues to meet operations and maintenance expenses, and the larger of&#13;
debt service or depreciation, while making a reasonable contribution to future investment.&#13;
There would be significantly less reliance on indirect revenues in order to stimulate a price-&#13;
based response to wastewater service provision.&#13;
5.7   Under SSPI, revenues are required to at least cover system  operation and&#13;
maintenance expenses and the larger of either depreciation or debt service. To ensure its&#13;
capacity to pay debt service, SSC was covenanted to maintain a debt service coverage ratio&#13;
of not less than 1.3 times. SMG considers, however, that the above covenants are not&#13;
appropriate for the proposed project and future investment programs in sewerage, as the&#13;
counterpart funding requirements would strain SMG's finances unless the users and&#13;
potential users of the service also were to make a contribution. Accordingly, SMG has&#13;
directed that SMSC's tariffs and charges be set at levels that would allow SMSC to make a&#13;
reasonable contribution, over time, to its investment programs. SMG would provide the&#13;
balance of counterpart funding requirements through capital grants.&#13;
5.8   In setting the above financial objectives for SMSC, SMG expects that the resulting&#13;
tariff structure would have a demand management effect, which, in turn, would have an&#13;
imnpact on total investment requirements, that could be substantial in the long run. A study&#13;
carried out in Shanghai on price elasticity of demand showed a value of -0.38, which is&#13;
consistent with international experience. Therefore, for a 1O percent increase in the real&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
price of water/wastewater, demand would fall by 3.8 percent. A study of income elasticity&#13;
in Shanghai estimated income elasticity of 0.22, meaning that if real incomes rose by&#13;
10 percent, water demand would rise 2.2 percent, in addition to any price effect.&#13;
5.9   Given the substantial rise in personal income in Shanghai during the past few years,&#13;
the resulting tariff would be easily affordable. As the current water/sewerage bill represents&#13;
only about 0.7 percent of average monthly household income, there appears ample scope for&#13;
increasing charges without prejudicing consumers' ability to pay. This is discussed further&#13;
inparas. 6.16 and 6.17.&#13;
C. SEWERAGE TARIFFS&#13;
5.10  As part of SSPI, a tariff study was carried out concurrently with the organization&#13;
study referred to in para. 4.8 above. The study concluded that: (a) a simple volumetric&#13;
charge, based on quantities of water supplied, for both domestic and nondomestic users was&#13;
the most appropriate tariff form at present, as data to support a more sophisticated structure&#13;
was not available; (b) an increasing block tariff would be desirable in terms of resource&#13;
conservation in the long term; (c) tariff levels should be based on average financial cost,&#13;
rather than marginal economic cost; (d) initial tariffs should be set at a relatively low level&#13;
sufficient for loan repayment, with escalation in future years to bring the levels in line with&#13;
full cost recovery and investment return objectives; (e) cross-subsidization between&#13;
domestic and nondomestic users should be avoided; and (f) government transfers should be&#13;
provided in relation to the costs associated with stormwater drainage and flood control and&#13;
for certain institutional users such as schools, hospitals and community facilities. SMG is&#13;
now implementing the main recommendations, though more slowly than expected, due to&#13;
pressures from the State to control inflation, and an expressed perception that tariff&#13;
increases could cause dissatisfaction in the community.&#13;
5.11   Commencing on December 1, 1986, SMG instituted a sewerage charge of&#13;
Y 0.12/m3 for industrial and commercial consumers only. The charge was based on&#13;
90 percent of water sold by SMWC. In July 1993 when water tariffs were increased, SMG&#13;
decided that Y 0.02/m3 of the increase should be paid to SMSC for sewerage services, thus&#13;
imposing an indirect charge on domestic consumers, and an additional, albeit indirect,&#13;
charge on nondomestic consumers. On August 1, 1994, SMG raised the direct charge for&#13;
nondomestic consumers by Y 0.02/mr3, to Y 0.14/m3. On July 1, 1995, SMG approved the&#13;
following tariff structure:   domestic-Y 0.14/m3, based on 100 percent of water&#13;
consumption, to be billed and collected by SMWC on behalf of SMSC; and nondomestic-&#13;
Y 0.34/m3, based on 90 percent of water consumption. The resulting average tariff&#13;
represents a 100 percent increase over the existing average. The revised tariffs were&#13;
scheduled to be implemented from March 1996. Implementation of these agreed increased&#13;
wastewater tariffs would be a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;
5.12  In addition to the revenues derived from sewerage tariffs, SMSC's revenues would&#13;
include two additional sources: (a) the 5 percent public utility additional tax collected by&#13;
SMWC as part of its water tariffs, which, from January 1, 1994, SMG has directed should&#13;
be allocated specifically to SMSC; and (b) transfers from SMG to defray the cost of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
stormwater removal. SMG considers stormwater removal to be a municipal service, to be&#13;
funded from general municipal revenues, as opposed to a sewerage service, to be recovered&#13;
from sewerage tariffs. SMSC has estimated that such costs represent 23.5 percent of its&#13;
annual operations and maintenance costs. In SMSC's financial projections (Annex13), the&#13;
utility tax and the transfers for stormwater have been treated as operational revenue and&#13;
nonoperating income, respectively. After 1996, SMSC would operate without further&#13;
operating subsidies.&#13;
D. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FORECAST&#13;
5.13  A financial analysis has been completed, using the following assumptions: SMSC's&#13;
operating revenues and transfers from SMG would meet: (a) (i) the cash operations and&#13;
maintenance costs; (ii) working capital needs; and (iii) debt service requirements; (b) a&#13;
contribution to SMSC's capital investment program starting at 5 percent in 1997, and&#13;
increased to 10 percent from 2001; and (c) a debt service coverage of not less than 1.3&#13;
times. In addition to the direct tariff, revenues would include (a) Government transfers&#13;
equivalent to some 23.5 percent of SMSC's estimate of storrnwater removal costs; and&#13;
(b) the proceeds of the 5 percent public utility additional tax collected by SMWC. The&#13;
balance of capital counterpart contributions would be provided by SMG in the form of&#13;
3.&#13;
capital grants. The resulting average annual tariff per m3, in current terms and assuming&#13;
adjustinents are made in mid-year, would be as follows: 1996-Y 0.35; 1997-Y 0.35;&#13;
1998-Y 0.38; 1999-Y 0.44; 2000-Y 0.46; 2001-Y 0.69; 2002-Y 0.69; and 2003-&#13;
Y 0.76. The projected financial statements, operating and financial monitoring indicators,&#13;
and the assumptions underlying the projections, are given in Annex 13.&#13;
5.14 Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SMG would, commencing in&#13;
fiscal year 1997, cause SMSC to (a) generate revenues from its sewerage operations&#13;
sufficient to cover its operating and maintenance costs (before depreciation), increases in&#13;
working capital, debt service requirements, and the following percentages of the average&#13;
capital expenditures made in a three-year period (the year preceding the reference year, the&#13;
reference year itself and the year after the reference year): 5 percent in years 1997, 1998,&#13;
1999 and 2000, and IO percent thereafter; and (b) incur no additional debt without the&#13;
Bank's agreement, unless a reasonable forecast shows that SMSC would have a debt&#13;
service coverage of at least 1.3 times.&#13;
5.15 Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that SMSC would prepare,&#13;
before September 30 of each year, forecasts satisfactory to the Ban/k reviewing whether it&#13;
would meet the covenanted requirements set forth above in such fiscal year and the&#13;
following fiscal year, and furnish the results of such reviews to the Bank If any such&#13;
review would show that SMSC would not meet the requirements set out above, SMG would&#13;
cause SMSC to take all necessary measures, including adjustments to the structure and&#13;
level of its tariffs and charges, in order to meet the requirements.&#13;
E. SHANGHAI MUNICIPAL FINANCES&#13;
5.16  Shanghai Municipality has two types of finance, on-budget and off-budget. On-&#13;
budgetary revenues are provided through taxes, the base and rate of which are set by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36 -&#13;
central government. The central government directly controls the largest tax source-the&#13;
value-added tax-receipts from which are shared with local government. A variety of other&#13;
taxes are collected and used directly by local government. Most off-budgetary revenues&#13;
consist of special fees paid by enterprises, and fees and charges relating to construction&#13;
activities. These are used for capital expenditures. On-budget and off-budget accounts are&#13;
not consolidated; the accounts of Shanghai's public service corporations are kept on an&#13;
enterprise basis and, therefore, not consolidated into the municipal accounts. While&#13;
information on the off-budgetary revenues and expenditures is confidential, and was not,&#13;
therefore, provided to the Bank, they are reported to be at least as large as the on-budgetary&#13;
data&#13;
5.17  Total revenues per capita amounted to about Y 1,350 in 1994, and represented&#13;
about 14 percent of Shanghai's GDP. Annex 14 provides projections of SM's municipal&#13;
finances up to the year 2002, together with some assumptions underlying the data.&#13;
Generally, the projections have been based on Shanghai's past performance. However,&#13;
given the additional accelerated economic growth forecast for Shanghai, the projections&#13;
should be treated as preliminary. The reduction in 1994 revenues is due to a change in&#13;
the tax structure, whereby value-added taxes are now collected by the state, not SMG.&#13;
5.18  Financial Resources for Environmental Protection. SMG's capital budget for&#13;
environmental protection programs in 1994 amounted to about Y 11,873 million&#13;
(equivalent to about $1,413 million), or about $150 per urban household (high for the&#13;
income level). These funds form a part of the regular municipal budget and are allocated by&#13;
the Shanghai Finance Bureau and the Shanghai Construction Commission. They are&#13;
elastic, being based on sales and income of the enterprises under SMG jurisdiction. While&#13;
they stagnated during the austerity period in the late 1980s, they increased steadily during&#13;
the subsequent ongoing economic recovery. The off-budgetary revenues (para. 5.16)&#13;
generally parallel the real rate of economic growth and the change in unit rates determined&#13;
by SMG, subject to national guidelines. Revenue growth would translate directly into&#13;
increased investment expenditures, which accounted for the major part of the infrastructure&#13;
budget in the past.&#13;
5.19  Given the growth prospects of revenue resources, especially for capital accounts,&#13;
additional expenditures attributable to the project represent a manageable portion of SMG's&#13;
infrastructure budget: about 26 percent in the first year, 27 percent in the second year,&#13;
20 percent in the third year, declining through the remaining years to about 8 percent in the&#13;
last year. If off-budget revenues were included, these rates would be about half those&#13;
indicated, which appear to be affordable. Debt service attributable to the project would be&#13;
equivalent to between 0.3 and 1 percent of the regular capital budget, rising to about&#13;
2 percent in the first year of repayment of principal, and declining thereafter. However,&#13;
debt service on about 97 percent of project investments would be met from user charges,&#13;
and would not, therefore, be a drain on the municipal budget. Additionally, the operation&#13;
and maintenance expenses on the same 97 percent of project investments would be met&#13;
from user charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37 -&#13;
6. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
A. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
6.1   Some 52 percent of Shanghai's average daily wastewater flow of 65 m3/sec&#13;
discharges directly into the network of canals in the city, or to the Huangpu River that&#13;
bisects Shanghai. As a result, canal water quality typically fails to reach the lowest level&#13;
needed for productive use and in its downstream reach the Huangpu quality falls below the&#13;
level deemed suitable for industrial use. Although raw water supplies for municipal use&#13;
would be protected through relocation of the main intake, emergency raw water abstraction&#13;
points and industrial abstraction continue at risk of either extraordinary treatment demands&#13;
or sheer unusability. The continued use of surface waters for clothes washing and small&#13;
boat travel expose people to unacceptable health risks and the fishery industry has been&#13;
destroyed by pollution. Other losses include amenity value. Significant improvements in&#13;
the management of wastewater and nightsoil systems, achieved through the project's&#13;
investments, would raise these waters to no lower than Category IV, suitable for fishery,&#13;
industrial and agricultural use, and ultimately the Huangpu itself to Category III, suitable as&#13;
a raw water source for municipal treatment plants.&#13;
B. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
6.2   The cost-effective provision of adequate wastewater facilities for Shanghai&#13;
Municipality is a prerequisite to the sustained public health and economic growth of the&#13;
most important city on the eastern seaboard of China. The implementation of fiscally&#13;
rational charges for wastewater management services under the project would induce&#13;
conservation of water supplies, reduce overall investment demand in both the water and&#13;
wastewater sectors, finance the needed investments and enhance government's efforts to&#13;
reform the economy. Improvements in the structure and management of wastewater&#13;
services would minimize the cost of meeting these goals.&#13;
C. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Economic Evaluation&#13;
6.3   The investment program supported by this loan would protect and improve the&#13;
quality of surface water in Shanghai and, as a consequence, enhance its value for&#13;
drinking, industrial, and agricultural use while minimizing any health threats. Further&#13;
benefits would come from recreational and aesthetic value increases.  Accurately&#13;
attributing specific values to these improvements would require a sophisticated model of&#13;
the entire Huangpu basin system (and part of the downstream Changjiang system) linking&#13;
polluting inputs, water quality outcomes, and the relationship of those to the uses noted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38 -&#13;
above. The complexity of attributing results to this specific project is engendered in part&#13;
by the fact that other projects, such as SSPI and SEP, as well as industrial relocation and&#13;
pollution control efforts, would be coming on line over the implementation period of this&#13;
project. All of these change the structure of polluting inputs or the risk created by those&#13;
inputs. Rather than attempt to build a model capturing these inputs and outputs, the&#13;
economic analysis rests on the generally accepted importance of capturing and safely&#13;
disposing urban wastewater flows. The main challenge for engineering and economic&#13;
analysis has been to identify the least-cost strategy to sustainably meet the national and&#13;
local surface water quality standards that represent a consensus on desirable water&#13;
quality.&#13;
6.4   The no-project alternative currently results in pollution levels that cause&#13;
unacceptable risk to Shanghai residents and their municipal and industrial water supplies.&#13;
Continued increases in wastewater flows, coupled with heavier pollution loads as&#13;
households switch to flush toilets and connect washing machines would simply&#13;
exacerbate current problems. The 1984 master plan used experience with Changjiang&#13;
conveyors built during the 1970s, and the long history of running treatment plants, to&#13;
establish that the least-cost abatement strategy would involve building additional&#13;
conveyors to handle remaining untreated flows. That analysis was confirmed during&#13;
Bank appraisal of SSPI, at which time the highest priority investment was deemed to be&#13;
capturing and conveying wastewater discharging into the downtown area (Suzhou Creek)&#13;
and surrounding waters. That investment, now operational, leaves about 52 percent of&#13;
wastewater to be collected and safely disposed of. In the long run, virtually all&#13;
wastewater must be captured if local waters are to be maintained at a quality that allows&#13;
human contact (and eventually allows the return of fish to the lower Huangpu). The&#13;
Shanghai Municipal Government, in a 1994 update of the 1984 Master Plan, confirmed&#13;
the priority in providing new sewerage services to be (a) the Wujing/Minhang districts;&#13;
(b) Puxi South Block; (c) Pudong New Area; (d) Puxi Middle Block; and (e) Puxi North&#13;
Block.&#13;
6.5   The priorities were based on projected flow increases to the year 2020, the nature&#13;
of the effluent from a given district, and the area that would suffer from the impact of that&#13;
effluent.  Of the unserved districts, Wujing/Minhang is both the most heavily&#13;
industrialized and the furthest upstream. Their proximity to the existing and new raw&#13;
water intakes supplying 90 percent of Shanghai's potable water reinforced the concern&#13;
that they be properly sewered, as the risk of catastrophic accidental industrial discharges&#13;
is greatest in Wujing/Minhang. The remaining districts are of two types: districts with&#13;
mixed domestic, commercial, and industrial waste streams quite similar to those handled&#13;
under SSPI; and the Pudong district, the new development zone that has large amounts of&#13;
greenfield industrial, commercial, and residential development. Taking advantage of the&#13;
new development of Pudong, separate sewers for foul water and drainage are being&#13;
installed there. In the built-up areas of Shanghai, the present combined systems would be&#13;
maintained because of the prohibitive cost of retrofitting separate systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
6.6   Given these characteristics of the remaining districts, the highest priority goes to&#13;
upstream effluents, reflecting the larger area of impact of the upstream discharges.&#13;
Pudong spans the Puxi south, middle, and north blocks, but the use of separate systems in&#13;
Pudong makes it important to pick up the undiluted foul water flows. Furthermore, much&#13;
of Pudong now drains to the existing Southern Sewer, the load on which already equals&#13;
its design capacity of 4.6 m3/sec.  The rapid development of Pudong can be&#13;
accommodated only with additional interceptor capacity.&#13;
6.7   Shanghai's priority ranking for further work, as described above, has been used to&#13;
develop a phased investrnent prograrn in wastewater handling. Construction of link&#13;
sewers in Wujing/Minhang, the highest priority area, has begun with support under SEP.&#13;
The scope of the present project was determined by matching the availability of funds to&#13;
the work needed to connect and convey wastewaters from each of the remaining districts.&#13;
The proposed program is thus the next phase of the work envisioned under the updated&#13;
1984 Sewerage Master Plan.&#13;
6.8  In the current phase, the Shanghai Municipal Government has judged, and the&#13;
Bank affirmed, that their financial resources permit a project of approximately Y 5,970&#13;
million ($633 million). Least-cost analysis, as discussed below, has shown that such a&#13;
program could capture and safely discharge effluent from Wujing/Minhang, Puxi South&#13;
Block, and Pudong. Puxi Middle Block and North Block would await the availability of&#13;
additional funds, with construction unlikely to commence before the year 2000.&#13;
Least-Cost Analysis&#13;
6.9   The analysis proceeds on a district-by-district basis, reflecting the accepted&#13;
priorities. Fundamental decisions were made for Wujing/Minhang prior to this project.&#13;
They involved possible discharge points for Wujing/Minhang wastewaters, for which&#13;
possibilities ranged from the Hangzhou Bay in the south, north to an area above the&#13;
chosen discharge point of Bailonggang. Although feasibility studies showed it to be&#13;
financially least cost, discharge to Hangzhou Bay was eventually dismissed as an option&#13;
due to the Bay's ecological fragility. The decision was therefore made to discharge to the&#13;
north, through the conveyor that would also pick up Puxi and Pudong loads.&#13;
6.10  Least-cost disposal options for Pudong and the suburban counties of Shanghai&#13;
have also been carried out. For projected flows to the year 2020, eight scenarios were&#13;
constructed. The first three discharge to Hangzhou Bay, the next three to the Huangpu,&#13;
and the last two to the Changjiang estuary. For each discharge location, a variety of&#13;
treatment options was considered, and their expected impact on the receiving waters&#13;
calculated. Full details are in the project files ("Strategic Planning Report"), but can be&#13;
summarized by noting that none of the Hangzhou Bay discharge options left that water&#13;
body with acceptable quality. The only Huangpu option that maintained water quality&#13;
within limits involved secondary treatment of all Pudong flows, at an economic NPV&#13;
(12 percent discount rate) of some Y 16,988 million. The two Changjiang discharge&#13;
scenarios did not significantly degrade that water body, although it was noted that&#13;
background phosphorus levels at the outfall already exceeded surface water quality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
standards and the Pudong/Puxi flows would add another 3 percent to those levels. The&#13;
two Changiiang discharge scenarios included one providing preliminary treatment, and&#13;
costing Y 4,754 million; and another providing enhance primary treatment, and costing&#13;
Y 6,140 million. Clearly, for Pudong, the Changjiang discharge option is far less costly&#13;
than the Huangpu option, and entails less environmental risk.&#13;
Wastewater Conveyor Routing&#13;
6.11  The next stage of analysis involved optimizing the conveyor routing to capture&#13;
flows and deliver them to Bailonggang. Here, seven routing options were considered,&#13;
each constrained to an outfall at the current site of the Southern Sewer outfall at&#13;
Bailonggang and at least one of the river crossings at the site of the Outer Ring Road&#13;
Crossing. All options envisage a possible second outfall 7 km south of Bailonggang to&#13;
handle augmented flows if Pudong development proceeds as anticipated. Differences&#13;
among the options relate principally to the number of river crossings, sizes of various&#13;
sections, and connections between existing and planned conveyors for flow balancing&#13;
purposes. Environmental impacts also vary among the options. The average incremental&#13;
economic cost for each option was calculated, and evaluated at a 12 percent discount rate.&#13;
The costs ranged from Y 1.50/m 3 to Y 1.76/m3. Although the lowest cost option was&#13;
selected, that selection also considered some uncosted factors reported in Annex 15, para.&#13;
26.&#13;
Wastewater Conveyor Sizing&#13;
6.12  The conveyor costs are very sensitive to sizing. Under the current strategy, the&#13;
conveyors would be sized to handle estimated flows up to the year 2006, at which time&#13;
additional conveyors would have to be built. The anticipated future investment program,&#13;
system financing requirements, and, ultimately, cost of the service are very sensitive to&#13;
changes in wastewater production. That, in turn, is a function of water demand and the&#13;
use of any processes that may minimize wastewater output. The current SMG estimates&#13;
for water demand reflect historical water and wastewater pricing regimes, in which water&#13;
prices have fallen substantially in relation to income and wastewater prices have&#13;
historically been zero. As a result of these assumptions, the year 2020 per capita&#13;
domestic water demand (medium growth scenario) is estimated to be 280 lcd. This can&#13;
be compared to Hong Kong, where current demand levels are about 260 lcd. The Hong&#13;
Kong experience, where real income levels are higher than can be expected for Shanghai&#13;
in 2020 and penetration of water-using labor-saving appliances is very high, suggests that&#13;
260 lcd might serve as a high estimate for Shanghai 2020 domestic consumption.&#13;
6.13  The impact of sizing conveyors for the medium growth scenario, while expecting&#13;
a lower growth rate in the outer years, is that future conveyor investments can be delayed.&#13;
This has a very favorable impact on the average price of services. Moreover, the use of&#13;
the higher growth scenario during this phase has the advantage of being less risky than a&#13;
lower growth assumption. Sizing to the low growth scenario would run the risk of&#13;
quickly using up all excess capacity and facing increasingly frequent discharges to&#13;
surface waters during wet weather.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41 -&#13;
6.14  The economic analysis shows a marginal cost of Y 1.50/m3, while the proposed&#13;
tariff is set at Y 0.40/m3. The tariff covers all financial costs because it applies to all&#13;
wastewater discharges in the city, not just those to the new system. An optimal tariff&#13;
would equal the marginal damage of pollution, which is currently unknown. The actual&#13;
tariff chosen is 20 times that prevailing in 1994 and marks a fundamental shift in&#13;
wastewater financing strategies for Shanghai. While economically suboptimal, it, like the&#13;
system itself, represents a phased movement toward radically improved service. Further&#13;
details of the economic analysis are shown in Annex 15.&#13;
D. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
6.15  The construction of large-scale civil works proposed under the project would&#13;
initially have a disruptive environmental impact on Shanghai, while in the medium term,&#13;
once the works are commissioned, the investments would contribute significantly to the&#13;
sustained improvement of Shanghai's environment and urban infrastructure services.&#13;
Potential adverse impacts from wastewater treatment and sludge disposal components&#13;
require an "A" category in terms of the World Bank's Operational Directive on&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA). Accordingly, a full EA has been completed, reviewed&#13;
and found satisfactory by the Bank and approved by NEPA. The EA identified a number of&#13;
potential impacts, most related to construction (traffic disruption, noise, spoil, etc.) and&#13;
others to system operation. All identified impacts are common to projects of this type.&#13;
Mitigation measures have been detailed in Table 7 of Annex 9. Overall EA findings are&#13;
also summarized in Annex 9.&#13;
E. AFFORDABILITY&#13;
6.16  Affordability of the new wastewater systems was tested against the current&#13;
consumption patterns and average income of the poorest 10 percent of Shanghai's urban&#13;
population. At the 1996 tariff level and assuming no price response, wastewater charges&#13;
would consume an average of 1.5 percent of the income of the poorest 10 percent. This&#13;
would increase the sum going to water plus wastewater to approximately 3.5 percent of&#13;
income for that group, assuming no change in their consumption pattern.&#13;
6.17  The long-run affordability of the tariffs would clearly depend on changes in real&#13;
income among the urban poor over time. Over the past decade, the real incomes of the&#13;
urban poor have risen in line with overall income increases. If that pattern continues, tariff&#13;
increases would be fully offset within the first year of the project. However, the very&#13;
poorest, at or below the bottom 0.5 percent income bracket, have not shown the sarne&#13;
responsiveness to new economic opportunities. This group would need additional income&#13;
from social welfare funds or other sources to avoid a fall in real consumption after the&#13;
imposition of the new tariffs.&#13;
F. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.18  Project risks fall into two basic categories: implementation risk and policy risk.&#13;
The main project risks are the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
(a)   delays by SMG in implementing tariffs and service charges that reflect&#13;
financial costs. To sustain the financial viability of providing adequate&#13;
wastewater services for Shanghai would require substantial and regular tariff&#13;
increases-this is politically challenging for SMG. The authorities have&#13;
expressed concern that increased tariffs could lower consumption of other&#13;
goods and services to an extent that would be politically unacceptable.&#13;
Furthermore, they have noted that even if affordable and politically&#13;
acceptable in themselves, the tariffs would add to inflation at a time when&#13;
the central authorities are insisting that cities limit price increases. Failure to&#13;
implement agreed tariffs would seriously impair the performance incentives&#13;
of SMSC.  To mitigate this risk, a tariff increase was approved for&#13;
implementation from March 1996. Financial sustainability will remain a&#13;
core element of our dialogue with SMG over the course of project&#13;
implementation;&#13;
(b)   institutional reform  in the sewerage company may lag the pace of&#13;
investment. To mitigate this risk, SMG has been encouraged to ensure&#13;
assets constructed under the project are taken into the accounts of SMSC,&#13;
and a careftilly designed technical assistance component has been included&#13;
in the project, which would begin implementation well before planned&#13;
effectiveness;&#13;
(c)   encountering construction difficulties at the proposed outfall site at&#13;
Bailonggang, due to unstable ground conditions. This risk would be&#13;
responded to in part by ensuring rigorous engineering standards, and&#13;
continued oversight by an engineering Review Panel, which has been&#13;
agreed. Members are being appointed;&#13;
(d)   possible delays by SMG in implementing the institutional development and&#13;
training components. These risks were discussed in detail with SMG, and&#13;
formed the core of our dialogue during project processing.  Project&#13;
formulation and design has been structured to minimize these risks, and to&#13;
maintain a focus on the overall policy framework; and&#13;
(e)   as noted above, the proposed investment is one stage in a long-term&#13;
investment plan. Sustained investment to expand wastewater coverage and&#13;
the adoption of a rigorous wastewater connection strategy consistent with&#13;
SMG's long-term wastewater management strategy, and compatible with&#13;
municipal financial capacity, would be needed to meet long-term&#13;
environmental protection and city service needs.&#13;
6.19  To encourage continued implementation of the broader program, the proposed&#13;
project includes funds for further project preparation and sets tariff targets that would&#13;
sustain future investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43 -&#13;
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1   The following assurances were obtained at negotiations:&#13;
(a)   SMG would onlend the proceeds of the loan to SMSC on terms acceptable&#13;
to the Bank (para. 3.1 1);&#13;

covenanted requirements set forth above in such fiscal year and the&#13;
following fiscal year, and furnish the results of such reviews to the Bank; if&#13;
any such review would show that SMSC would not meet its requirements,&#13;
SMG would cause SMSC to take all necessary measures, including&#13;
adjustments to the structure and level of its tariffs and charges, in order to&#13;
meet the requirements (para. 5.15).&#13;
7.2   Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between SM and SMSC, satisfactory to&#13;

ANNEX 3: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. BACKGROUND/SETTING OF PROJECT&#13;
1.    Shanghai, China's largest metropolitan area, has a population of about 14 million.&#13;
The city is located on the lower delta of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River, where it joins the&#13;
East China Sea. Numerous watercourses flow through the municipal area, mainly draining&#13;
to the Huangpu River which passes through the city center and flows into the Changjiang.&#13;
These watercourses are interconnected and tidal, experiencing several hours a day of reverse&#13;
flows during high tides. The waterways serve many functions, among them receiving&#13;
stormwater, and industrial and domestic wastewater flows. Prior to the commissioning in&#13;
1993 of the main interceptor financed under the Shanghai Sewerage Project-SSPI (Loan&#13;
2794/ Credit 1779), only about 0.5 Mm3/day of the 5.4 Mm3 /day of wastewater flows was&#13;
collected by combined (wastewater and stormwater) sewers.  Currently, only about&#13;
48 percent of the flows (2.6 Mm3/day) can be collected, due to a lack of basic urban&#13;
infrastructure; the remainder is discharged directly into streams or the Huangpu.&#13;
2.    Less than two thirds of the wastewater collected receives any form of treatment,&#13;
most of that being restricted mainly to pretreatment of industrial wastes, or through septic&#13;
tanks from which the effluents are discharged into nearby waterways. Low collection and&#13;
treatment levels result in substantial pollutant loads entering the surrounding waterways,&#13;
causing major environmental and ecological damage to the water resources, posing&#13;
significant health risks, and restricting economic growth. Fish cannot live in the lower&#13;
Huangpu and tributary streams, and shellfish downstream of the city carry very high&#13;
pathogen levels that result in illness when eaten by humans. The river system tides drive&#13;
pollutants upstream as far as Shanghai's drinking water treatment plant intakes, which has&#13;
forced either massive investment to relocate these intakes to safer areas, or considerably&#13;
increased water treatment costs, and given rise to a high and costly risk of emergency shut&#13;
downs.&#13;
3.    As living standards rise, the 50 percent of Shanghai's citizens who currently rely on&#13;
nightsoil buckets (emptied daily to holding tanks) for indoor sanitation and yard taps are&#13;
relocating to housing with flush toilets, and indoor taps that allow the use of washing&#13;
machines and other conveniences. Domestic sources of pollutants would therefore steadily&#13;
increase over the next few years, further overloading the wastewater facilities. This project&#13;
would aim to put in place strategies and mechanisms to address the urban environmental&#13;
management problems highlighted above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                    ANNEX3&#13;
B. SHANGHAI'S WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT STRATEGY&#13;
4.   In the mid-1980s, both the State and the Shanghai Municipal Government (SMG)&#13;
recognized Shanghai's serious backlog in the provision of basic and essential urban&#13;
environmental services and the long-term economic and environmental damage that this&#13;
would cause to Eastern China. Ultimately, these deficiencies would increase the cost of&#13;
achieving sustainable development. The various government levels therefore began to&#13;
identify strategies for city wastewater and for environmental protection of the whole East&#13;
China area. With the help of international consultants, SMG completed a study in 1986&#13;
identifying an optimal wastewater management strategy for the city, which it subsequently&#13;
adopted, comprising a phased investment program of combined wastewater collection&#13;
systems, managed by a financially sustainable urban wastewater utility, which would&#13;
charge for services.&#13;
5.    SMG embarked on a medium-term program of investments in combined sewers,&#13;
with World Bank Group support of the FY87 SSPI assisting the program's first phase,&#13;
serving the northern part of the city. The project was instrumental in creating a company to&#13;
manage the wastewater systems and in introducing wastewater tariffs. Construction is now&#13;
substantially complete, with the new system currently handling an average dry-weather&#13;
flow of 1.2 Mm3/day. The program's second phase (Phase II), for the southern part of the&#13;
city, would be supported under the proposed Second Shanghai Sewerage Project (SSPII),&#13;
which would consolidate and extend the institutional and policy objectives of the first&#13;
project. Complementing these initiatives are: (a) a water quality protection program being&#13;
supported under the recently approved Shanghai Environment Project-SEP (Loan 3711-&#13;
CHA), which supports investments in water supply and related environmental management;&#13;
(b) the ongoing, Japanese-assisted Hangzhou Bay Study, aimed at formulating an&#13;
environmental protection strategy for Hangzhou Bay, the most heavily loaded receiving&#13;
water body in Eastern China; and (c) institutional development measures, including water&#13;
tariff enhancements and selective reduction of point source pollution, undertaken to support&#13;
Phase I.&#13;
6.    Phase I of the Shanghai Wastewater Strategy was designed to remove about&#13;
20 percent of the total urban pollution load in the Huangpu River, leaving about 80 percent&#13;
of the pollution load and approximately 2.8 Mm3/day of dry-weather flow to continue&#13;
discharging directly to surface waters. With the assistance of the proposed project, Phase II&#13;
would aim to collect these pollution loads, thereby contributing to the biological viability of&#13;
the lower Huangpu and the long-run protection of Shanghai's principal fresh water intake.&#13;
The project would facilitate collection of flows from an area covering some 240 km2 in the&#13;
rapidly developing Pudong and Puxi areas of the city. It would have an initial capacity of&#13;
1.7 Mrn3/day of dry weather flow and be sized to capture projected flows of 5.0 Mm3/day&#13;
for the year 2020; the system would also collect wastewater flows from the first stage of the&#13;
Wujing/Minhang conveyor system funded under SEP, discharging to a watercourse with&#13;
sufficient assimilative capacity for the flows and pollution loads expected to occur during&#13;
the next two decades.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-                       ANNEX3&#13;
7.    As noted above, approximately two thirds of collected discharges receive some form&#13;
of treatment. The Phase I conveyor discharges to the Changjiang River at Zhuyuan, where&#13;
the assimilative capacity ensures no adverse effect to downstream users. Phase II flows&#13;
would discharge through a submerged outfall at Bailonggang at the freshwater/saltwater&#13;
interface with high turbidity mixing zone (currently the site of a small surface outfall).&#13;
Bailonggang is some 25 km downstream of Zhuyuan. Extensive modeling of the&#13;
Bailonggang area has confirmed that the Changjiang has sufficient assimilative capacity as&#13;
an outfall for a BOD discharge of some 300 tons/day, and that the environmental impact of&#13;
these discharges at Bailonggang and in the adjacent Hangzhou Bay would be acceptable. In&#13;
addition, SMG has allocated land for the future construction of a chemically-assisted&#13;
primary wastewater treatment plant, with an initial treatment capacity of about 0.8 Mm3/day&#13;
of wastewater. Engineering studies for the treatment plant for Phase II flows are underway,&#13;
ensuring that the plant could be constructed in stages as pollution loads and flows increase&#13;
over time (commnencing about the year 2000). The environmental objective would be to&#13;
ensure that phosphorus levels discharged do not reach levels that would cause&#13;
eutrophication in the vicinity, and that dissolved oxygen levels are such as to not endanger&#13;
marine life; the discharge studies found these criteria to be acceptable. This phased strategy&#13;
is also the least-cost approach to environmental management.&#13;
8.    The proposed Second Shanghai Sewerage Project (SSPII) would build on SSPI and&#13;
would comprise a focused package of financial and policy initiatives, and planning and&#13;
management reforms, supported by an investment program of wastewater capital works and&#13;
related institutional strengthening, thereby improving the quality of life in China's largest&#13;
city and preventing further costly environmental degradation. This second phase would&#13;
comprise a conveyor and treatment system to discharge effluent into the East China Sea in&#13;
the vicinity of Bailonggang where the assimilative capacity is considered satisfactory. This&#13;
phase of the overall program would accommodate the recent decision by SMG, after&#13;
considering viable options, that all wastewater from the Wujing/Minhang area would be&#13;
discharged to the east. The first stage of the Wujing/Minhang conveyor system is included&#13;
in SEP.&#13;
9.    Data on the method and extent of system connections is limited and complicated by&#13;
the lack of data on property, enterprise and residential ownership. Responsibility for&#13;
dwelling maintenance, including for wastewater services, at present in most cases under the&#13;
main enterprises, is expected to change as economic reform deepens, and individual and&#13;
corporate asset ownership increases. To safeguard the water bodies round the City, and in&#13;
particular the main water supply system (the Huangpu River), steps are urgently required to&#13;
establish a reliable data base, and policy framework for future wastewater collection and&#13;
disposal; all important would also be a data base on which sustainable financial charging&#13;
policies can be developed and implemented.&#13;
C. BACKGROUND TO WASTEWATER DIsPosAL IN SHANGHAI&#13;
10.   Wastewater Discharges. The combined storm and sanitary wastewater from&#13;
Shanghai urban areas is at present estimated at about 5,400,000 m3/d. Sewers already&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -                     ANNEX3&#13;
constructed and those recently completed under Phase I (SSPI) of the SMG Sewerage&#13;
Program allow discharges of wastewater as follows:&#13;
(a)   Western Interceptor-Shidonkou (Changjiang) 700,000 m3/d;&#13;
(b)   Southern Interceptor-Bailonggang (E. China Sea) 500,000 m3/d; and&#13;
(c)   Phase I Sewerage-Zhuyuan (Changjiang) 1,400,000 m3/d.&#13;
11.   These works leave remaining some 2,800,000 m3/d of wastewater to be discharged&#13;
into the Huangpu and hence to the Changjiang. Phase II, of which SSPII is a part, is&#13;
planned with an ultimate capacity of 5,000,000 m3/d by the year 2020, including the&#13;
discharge of 700,000 m3/d of wastewater from the Minhang and Wujing area.&#13;
12.   The wide environmental impacts of these discharges including those from the&#13;
proposed outfall at Bailonggang are being examined under the Hangzhou Bay Study.&#13;
However, the local effects have been modeled by the Danish Hydraulics Institute and the&#13;
East China Normal University, and the requirements for treatment determined.&#13;
D. RATIONALE FOR TREATMENT PROPOSALS&#13;
13.   A discharge to the Changjiang would be required to comply with the Standards for&#13;
Discharge to Fresh Waters (GB 8978-88). The critical parameters of the discharge&#13;
standards in terms of treatment process selection are BOD/COD, suspended solids and&#13;
ammonia. Although not specifically included in the standards, the concentration of&#13;
phosphorus is also of interest in terms of the relative significance of the phosphorus load of&#13;
the Shanghai wastewater in terms of the load of the Changjiang. The latter is important in&#13;
connection with the nutrient status of Hangzhou Bay.&#13;
14.   The concentration of these parameters in the ultimate discharge at Bailonggang&#13;
would depend upon water consumption and upon the type of industry in the areas of&#13;
Shanghai served by the sewerage system, in particular the Pudong area. However, the&#13;
composition of the discharge at the existing outfall constructed as part of the First Shanghai&#13;
Sewerage Project (SSPI) is reasonably representative of the prospective discharge at&#13;
Bailonggang in the short term, given the relative proportions of domestic and industrial&#13;
wastewater.&#13;
15.   Data for the SSPI discharge indicate that the Shanghai wastewater is weak,&#13;
reflecting the high water consumption in both the domestic and industrial sectors. The&#13;
untreated wastewater would comply with the anmmonia and suspended solids standards and&#13;
would exceed the standards for BOD and COD on average by about 40 and 30 percent&#13;
respectively. Concentrations of the other parameters specified in the standard, such as toxic&#13;
metals are substantially lower than the discharge standard limits.&#13;
16.   The impact of the initial wastewater discharge of 1,700, 000 m3/d without treatment&#13;
on water quality in the Changjiang at Bailonggang under winter low flow and summer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51-                      ANNEX3&#13;
conditions has been investigated by means of mathematical modeling. Compliance with the&#13;
Class III fresh water quality standard in the Changjiang is achieved at dilutions of the SSPII&#13;
wastewater by a factor of approximately 50. The mathematical modeling studies predicted&#13;
that the impact of the discharge would be minimal, with the area of the immediate mixing&#13;
zone in which such a level of dilution were not achieved being small, between 0.5 and&#13;
3.2 km2 depending upon the river flow and the tidal conditions. Thus a passage for fish&#13;
migration would be preserved. The modeling also indicated that the impact of the ultimate&#13;
discharge of 5,000,000 m 3/d via three outfalls would also be small.&#13;
17.  In view of the minimal impact of the immediate term discharge upon water quality&#13;
in the Changjiang, due largely to the very high flows and dilution capacity of the&#13;
Changjiang, and the negative impact of wastewater treatment sludge disposal, it is proposed&#13;
to adopt the following approach to discharge standards, and therefore the degree of&#13;
wastewater treatment required for compliance:&#13;
18.   Pollutants that are toxic or accumulative would be strictly controlled immediately,&#13;
principally at source, and the concentration-based standards would continue be met; and&#13;
degradable pollutants such as BOD, COD and ammonia would be controlled on a total load&#13;
basis.&#13;
19.  In terms of the degradable pollutants the concentration-based standards (Class II of&#13;
GB 8978-88) would be imposed only in the longer term (2020). In the intermediate term&#13;
there would be treatment to reduce the pollution loads only when, without such a reduction,&#13;
they would exceed that of the ultimate flow of 5,000,000 m3/d at the Class II standard.&#13;
20.   The growth in loads of BOD, COD and ammonia in the SSPII catchment area are&#13;
shown below. The growth in BOD and COD loads occurs as a result not only of population&#13;
growth and industrial development but also because of the progressive phasing out of the&#13;
nightsoil and septic tank systems in favor of direct discharge to sewer systems. It will be&#13;
seen that even in 2020 the ammonia concentration would still be within the standard and&#13;
treatment would be necessary only to reduce concentrations of BOD/COD.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                    ANNEX3&#13;
21.   On this basis, it is proposed to provide preliminary treatment (screening and grit&#13;
removal) only in the immediate term. Based on the data above, it is expected that treatment&#13;
of the wastewater discharge at Bailonggang would not become necessary to comply with&#13;
BOD load requirements until about 2015.&#13;
22.   However, the Changjiang is a major source of nutrients discharged to Hangzhou&#13;
Bay, indicating a need for control of nutrients throughout the catchment. As a contribution&#13;
by Shanghai towards reducing the phosphorus load in the Changjiang (albeit that the load&#13;
from Shanghai represents only about 3 percent of this load) it is proposed to introduce&#13;
treatment in the form of chemically assisted primary treatment, using iron salts, in 2005,&#13;
with the immediate objective of reducing the load of phosphorus discharged from Shanghai.&#13;
23.   The treatment proposed would sustain the average total phosphorus load from&#13;
Shanghai as a whole at less than the predicted year 2000 levels (18 tons/day) and in addition&#13;
would be sufficient to effect the necessary reduction in BOD and COD to comply with the&#13;
concentration based standards when required. To optimize pretreatment process efficiency,&#13;
it is proposed to treat only a proportion of the wastewater flow, but to achieve a very high&#13;
level of phosphorus removal from this smaller flow, thereby obtaining the required&#13;
pollution load reduction. The first stage of treatment will need to be operational by not later&#13;
than the year 2005 and would treat a flow of 0.86 Mm3/d, with extensions to increase&#13;
treatment capacity to 2.2 Mm3/d in the year 2015.&#13;
24.   Details of this approach to compliance with wastewater discharge standards have&#13;
been discussed and agreed with NEPA.&#13;
E. PROPOSED PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
25.   The components of the proposed project investments are described in detail below&#13;
and summarized in tabular form. The project would be implemented by the Shanghai&#13;
Municipal Sewerage Company (SMSC).&#13;
General&#13;
26.   The scheme, which is designed for the year 2020, provides for the collection,&#13;
conveyance, treatment and disposal of mixed industrial, commercial and domestic&#13;
wastewater from Luwan and Xuhui districts in Puxi South area, Wujing/Minhang districts,&#13;
and the Yangsi industrial and residential area, Gardening Zone, Shangchuan and Hudong&#13;
Residential Areas, Jinqiao industrial and residential areas, and other future development&#13;
zones in Pudong central area, together with urgent rehabilitation of existing wastewater&#13;
pump stations and treatment facilities in these areas. The project area covers about 240 km2&#13;
with an average wastewater dry-weather flow of around 1.7 Mmn3/d.&#13;

carried out to measure them. Section C discusses the elements of the resettlement&#13;
implementation framework. The major portion of the project would be in the Pudong&#13;
new area, the suburban and rural area on the outskirts of Shanghai. The implementation&#13;
of the project is proposed to commence in April 1996 and would continue up to June&#13;
2001.&#13;
B. PROJECT IMPACTS&#13;
2.    Project components requiring land acquisition are the following:&#13;
(a)   Interceptor in Puxi;&#13;
(b)   Interceptor in Pudong;&#13;
(c)   Two siphons under the Huangpu river (Wujing/Minhang and Puxi to&#13;
Pudong);&#13;
(d)   Four pumping stations; and&#13;
(e)   Treatment plant and outfall at Bailonggang.&#13;
3.    Construction of the above-mentioned components of the project would require&#13;
land acquisition and resettlement/rehabilitation of people affected by the project. In order&#13;
to determine the impact of the project on affected people and properties, Shanghai&#13;
Sewerage Project Construction Company (SSPCC) conducted two surveys:&#13;
(a)   Census survey of affected persons and properties; and&#13;
(b)   Socioeconomic survey of affected persons&#13;
4.    The census survey of affected persons and properties was carried out from&#13;
March 1-31, 1995 by SSPCC in collaboration with the local governments and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                     ANNEX8&#13;
representatives of the affected people. The surveys were carried out on the basis of the&#13;
engineering designs available as of March 31, 1995. There may be some minor&#13;
modifications in the engineering designs that would be the basis of the final census&#13;
surveys to be carried out sufficiently before implementation of land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement activities. The following impacts were identified in the census surveys:&#13;
(a) the total amount of land to be acquired is approximately 188 ha; (b) approximately&#13;
114 ha of land would be required temporarily during construction; (c) a total of 1,092&#13;
houses with an area of 147,250 m2 would be relocated; (d) 173 enterprises would be&#13;
affected by the project, out of which 21 would need to be relocated while the rest can be&#13;
reorganized at the same location after construction; (e) the total number of persons&#13;
affected by land acquisition andlor resettlement is 7,426. Out of these, 1,516 are affected&#13;
both by land acquisition and house relocation. A total of 4,924 and 4,018 persons are&#13;
affected by land acquisition and resettlement alone, respectively; (f) there are 2,143&#13;
persons within the working age out of the 4,924 affected by land acquisition; (g) 671&#13;
persons would be eligible for payment of old-age pension and other special rehabilitation&#13;
measures; (h) 30,091 workers, working in 173 enterprises affected by the project would&#13;
also be affected. Some 2,391 workers, working in the 21 enterprises to be relocated,&#13;
would be affected until the enterprises are reconstructed. The remaining 27,700 workers&#13;
would be affected only during the construction period and would continue to work at the&#13;
enterprises at the same location.&#13;
5.    The socioeconomic survey of affected people was carried out by the Shanghai&#13;
Academy of Social Sciences (SASS) in May 1995 to identify the main socioeconomic&#13;
impacts of the project on the affected people. The survey results stress the need to pay&#13;
adequate, replacement levels of compensation to affected people and the need for timely&#13;
provision of new jobs. The affected people are in support of the project and wanted&#13;
timely and adequate compensation and resettlementlrehabilitation arrangements. SASS&#13;
would conduct detailed baseline socioeconomic surveys of the affected persons in each&#13;
contract before the initiation of land acquisition and resettlement activities on the&#13;
respective contract of the project. The baseline survey would measure the income levels&#13;
and standards of living of the affected persons before land acquisition and resettlement.&#13;
This baseline socioeconomic survey would form the basis for future comparison of their&#13;
income levels and standards of living as reported by the monitoring reports.&#13;
Minimization Of Land Acquisition And Resettlement&#13;
6.    Substantial efforts were made throughout the planning and preparation stages of&#13;
the project to minimize the impacts of land acquisition and resettlement. Regular&#13;
discussions were held between the Pre-Engineering Department of SSPCC, the Shanghai&#13;
Municipal Engineering Design Institute (SMEDI) and the Shanghai Urban Construction&#13;
and Design Institute. Discussions were also held by the above agencies with World Bank&#13;
missions. The design and alignment of the interceptor was modified at a nurnber of&#13;
locations to avoid or reduce the impacts of land acquisition. Special efforts would also be&#13;
made during implementation to minimize the disruption of economic and other activities&#13;
due to construction. It is the result of systematic efforts to minimize land acquisition and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

resettlement impacts that only 4,018 persons would need relocation by construction of an&#13;
interceptor, which is about 50 km long, four pumping stations and a treatment plant.&#13;
C. FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF LAND ACQUISITION&#13;
AND RESETTLEMENT ACTIVITIES&#13;
7.    The framework for implementation of land acquisition and resettlement program&#13;
was set out by SSPCC in the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) dated July 1995.&#13;
Following the merger of SSPCC with the Shanghai Sewerage Company in November&#13;
1995, the new company-the Shanghai Municipal Sewerage Company, Ltd. (SMSC)-&#13;
would have responsibility for implementation of the RAP (para. 16). The framework&#13;
consists of the following:&#13;
(a)   Objectives and Principles of Resettlement;&#13;
(b)   Legal framework and resettlement policies;&#13;
(c)   Provisions for Job Creation;&#13;
(d)   Resettlement Institutions and agencies;&#13;
(e)   Costs and Budget;&#13;

(g)   Participation and Consultations;&#13;
(h)   Redressal of grievances and the appeals process; and&#13;
(i)    Monitoring and Evaluation of Resettlement.&#13;
The RAP, covering the above components of resettlement implementation framework,&#13;
was prepared by SSPCC based on discussions held with various Bank preparation&#13;
missions and the experience gained by SSPCC through implementation of the First&#13;
Shanghai Sewerage Project (SSPI).  These components of the framework for&#13;
implementation are described below:&#13;
Objectives and Principles of Resettlement&#13;
8.    The main objective of the land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) program is to&#13;
ensure that the standards of living and income levels of all categories of affected persons&#13;
are improved, or at least restored after resettlement. The main principles on the basis of&#13;
which the LAR program would be implemented are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Minimize resettlement as much as possible through changes in design and&#13;
alignment;&#13;
(b)   Compensation for all structures would be paid at the replacement value of&#13;
these structures;&#13;

In case it is found that the standards of living of any category of affected persons have not&#13;
been restored after relocation/resettlement, SMSC would be responsible to take additional&#13;
measures to ensure that the main objective of the RAP is achieved.&#13;
Job Creation&#13;
12.   The persons affected by land acquisition would be provided with jobs in&#13;
nonagricultural enterprises or have the option of self-employment in case they posses&#13;
some technical qualifications. The number of persons to be provided jobs is calculated&#13;
on the basis of maintaining the average per capita land holding in Pudong new area. Out&#13;
of the 2,801 to be provided with nonagriculture based rehabilitation, 2,132 are eligible for&#13;
jobs and 669 are eligible for old-age pension. The residence registration of those who are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -                    ANNEX8&#13;
eligible for provision of jobs would be changed from rural to urban. Jobs to the eligible&#13;
persons would be provided through one of the following methods:&#13;

13.  Job creation is the responsibility of SMSC, assisted by the Shanghai Land&#13;
Management Bureau (SLMB), the Pudong New Area Labor Management Center&#13;
(PNALMC) and the labor bureau in Puxi. Arrangements to provide jobs to eligible labor&#13;
are necessary before the Construction Land Use Certificate (CLUC) is issued by the&#13;
Shanghai Housing and Land Administration Bureau (SHLAB). SMSC would pay&#13;
Y 40,000/worker to township enterprises and Y 30,000/worker to other enterprises for job&#13;
creation. In case the affected person opts for self-employment, he/she would be paid a&#13;
resettlement subsidy of minimum Y 15,000 (males &lt;35 years, females &lt;25 years) and&#13;
Y 1,000 additional for each additional year.&#13;
14.   Jobs should be provided within one month of signing the agreement for land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement between SMSC and the local Land Acquisition Business&#13;
Agencies (LABAs). However, if jobs are not provided within three months of land&#13;
acquisition, SMSC would provide temporary jobs to affected persons in SMSC until&#13;
enterprise jobs can be provided. For a period of three months a monthly subsistence&#13;
allowance of Y 250/eligible person would be paid. The job creation schedule and the&#13;
names of enterprises that would provided jobs have been provided in the RAP.&#13;
15.   The persons eligible for job creation would be provided training in specific skills&#13;
before they are employed on the jobs. The training would be provided in Technical&#13;
Training Schools, Professional Training Centers at the district/county level, Township&#13;
Training Centers and in-house training centers of large enterprises.  Out of the&#13;
resettlement subsidy to be paid to enterprises, an amount of Y 4,000 would be reserved&#13;
specially for training.&#13;
Resettlement Institutions and Agencies&#13;
16.   SMG  has vested overall responsibility for coordination of planning and&#13;
implementation of resettlement activities with SMSC. Implementation of resettlement&#13;
would be carried out by SMSC supported at the local level by the respective LABAs and&#13;
local governments. Apart from these, the main departments/bureaus/agencies responsible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79 -                     ANNEX8&#13;
for providing support to the various aspects of LAR planning, implementing,&#13;
coordinating and monitoring resettlement activities are the following:&#13;
(a)   The Shanghai City Planning Administrative Bureau (SCPAB);&#13;
(b)   The Shanghai Housing and Land Administration Bureau (SHLAB);&#13;
(c)   The Housing Relocation Center (Pudong) and the Municipal Engineering&#13;
Construction Company (Puxi) are responsible for housing allocation under&#13;
SHLAB;&#13;
(d)   The Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau (SMLB);&#13;

institutes as appropriate; and&#13;
(g)   The Economic Legal and Social Consultancy Center of the Shanghai&#13;
Academy of Social Sciences (SASS).&#13;
In addition to the above, a Resettlement Coordination Group (RCG) has been formed&#13;
with members from all involved agencies and chaired by SMSC for SMG. This group&#13;
would meet every two months throughout resettlement implementation to resolve&#13;
coordination issues.&#13;
17.   Staff of SSPCC (now SMSC) attended the Resettlement Training Program&#13;
organized by the World Bank at Nanjing in April 1995. The staff who received training&#13;
at Nanjing have been conducting in-house training programs in SMSC. Officials of key&#13;
departments of SMG also have regular discussions and seminars with SMSC officials.&#13;
SMSC would organize a training program at least once a year, throughout resettlement&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Costs and Financing&#13;
18.   The costs to be incurred on RAP implementation would be a part of the overall&#13;
budget of the SSPII project. The annual requirement of funds would be included in the&#13;
annual investment plan for the project. The total base cost of land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement is estimated at about Y 1,161 million; detailed cost estimates (yearwise) are&#13;
shown in Table 1. SMSC would provide the funds for RAP implementation to the&#13;
respective LABAs, State and Collective enterprises, public utility companies and Labor&#13;
Bureau/PNALMC who would incur expenditures based on the specific provisions of the&#13;
RAP.&#13;

19.   The respective LABAs responsible for implementation of LAR agreements would&#13;
be paid administrative expenses at the rate of 2 percent of the total compensation payable&#13;
in their areas. The cost estimates would be adjusted annually based on the actual inflation&#13;
rate for the past year. Physical contingencies of 10 percent of the cost estimates have also&#13;
been budgeted for. SMSC would be responsible for the provision of adequate funds to&#13;
carry out RAP implementation and for financing cost overruns, if any.&#13;
Implementation of Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
20.      The construction of the conveyor and the pumping stations would be carried out&#13;
in phases. There would be 13 separate contracts with separate "startup" dates of&#13;
construction ranging from April 1995 to November 1998. The land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement activities (specified in detail in the RAP) on any given contract should be&#13;
completed at least one month before the proposed date of start of construction on that&#13;
contract. SMSC would certify before the start of any given contract that the LAR&#13;
activities on that contract have been completed. The proposed "startup" and completion&#13;
dates for the various contracts are given in Table 2. The RAP also provides a generic&#13;
schedule for completion of all land acquisition and resettlement activities in any given&#13;
contract. Based on this, a "Generic Implementation Schedule" has been prepared which&#13;
can be used to arrive at the specific dates of completion of the various land acquisition&#13;
and resettlement activities in any contract by providing the proposed start up date for&#13;
resettlement activities.&#13;

Participation and Consultations&#13;
21.    The LAR program  has been designed with the active involvement of affected&#13;
persons and their representatives. The affected persons were informed about the project&#13;
at the very early stages through meetings in the affected areas. The affected persons and&#13;
their representatives participated in the census surveys carried out by SMEDI, SMSC and&#13;
SASS. A Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB) would be given to each affected&#13;
household after the project is approved by the Bank. The RIB would contain information&#13;
regarding the project and its resettlement aspects and also information on the specific&#13;
entitlements of each affected household. SMSC has also located a field office, easily&#13;
accessible to the affected persons, within the affected area, in order to provide&#13;
information to affected persons and resolve their grievances. The affected persons have&#13;
participated in/would participate in the following activities:&#13;
(a)    Select specific  resettlement locations for residential sites  and  for&#13;
enterprises;&#13;
(b)    construct their own houses (depending on their option);&#13;
(c)    transfer their assets to the new houses;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                    ANNEX8&#13;
(d)   select enterprises for jobs;&#13;
(e)   exercise the option of self-employment; and&#13;
(f)   Manage implementation of the LAR program through their village,&#13;
township representatives.&#13;
Redressal of Grievances and the appeals process&#13;
22.  In order to ensure that the affected people have avenues for redressing their&#13;
grievances, detailed procedures for redressal of grievances have been established. The&#13;
procedure consists of four stages: (a) in the first stage the affected person can lodge a&#13;
grievance with the local LAB, SHLAB, SMSC or the Pudong LAB or District LAB (in&#13;
Puxi). The local (township) LABAs should respond to the request in 15 days; (b) in case&#13;
the person is not satisfied, he/she can appeal to PLEBE or the District LABAs within one&#13;
month from the date of response of the LAB; (c) if the affected person is still not&#13;
satisfied, an appeal can be made to the SHLAB of SMG for redressing of grievance; (d) if&#13;
the affected person is still dissatisfied with the response, an appeal can be lodged with the&#13;
People's Court, in accordance with the "Civil Procedure Act," within 15 days of&#13;
receiving the decision from CLIMB. For grievances related to job provision, the&#13;
respective labor bureau at the various levels would be the appropriate authorities. The&#13;
grievance could be for any aspect of the LAR program including rates of compensation.&#13;
Grievance mechanisms would be widely publicized among the affected persons through&#13;
the RIB.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
23.  In order to ensure that the implementation of the LAR program would be carried&#13;
out in accordance with the provisions of the RAP, detailed monitoring and evaluation,&#13;
both internal and external would be carried out, both during and after implementation of&#13;
the project.&#13;
24.   Internal Monitoring. SMSC would be responsible for internal monitoring of the&#13;
LAR program. Monitoring would be carried out based on the provisions of the RAP.&#13;
The main indicators to be monitored are, payment of compensation, allotment of housing&#13;
in accordance with the options exercised, provision of jobs, restoration of public&#13;
facilities, payment of pension, payment of self-employment subsidy, restoration of&#13;
production activities of enterprises. The internal monitoring reports would be prepared&#13;
every three months. Detailed monitoring formats have been agreed and are provided as&#13;
an annex to the RAP. The internal monitoring report would be submitted to the World&#13;
Bank quarterly, starting April 30, 1996. The report would be discussed in the next&#13;
meeting of RCG and detailed follow-up measures would be recommended by RCG.&#13;
25.   External Monitoring. The Legal Economic, and Social Consultancy Center of&#13;
SASS has been contracted to conduct independent, external monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
the LAR program. In addition to verifying the results of the internal monitoring reports,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -                    ANNEX8&#13;
SASS would monitor the following qualitative indicators: (a) is the compensation paid&#13;
on time and is it adequate; (b) verify the linkage of land acquisition and resettlement;&#13;
(c) timely provision of appropriate jobs; (d) adequate restoration of civic infrastructure;&#13;
(e) relocation of enterprises in accordance with the policy provisions contained in the&#13;
RAP; (f) provision of alternative housing in accordance with the option exercised and in a&#13;
timely manner; (g) measure the level of satisfaction among the affected persons;&#13;
(h) survey the standards of living after relocation. In order to measure the standards of&#13;
living after resettlement, SASS would conduct another socioeconomic survey of the&#13;
resettled persons one year after project completion.&#13;
26.   The methodology for carrying out external monitoring and evaluation has been&#13;
described in the RAP. SASS would maintain a data base with files on each affected&#13;
household, which would be updated based on information collected in successive rounds&#13;
of monitoring. The Monitoring and Evaluation Report would be prepared by SASS every&#13;
three months, starting end-June 1996 until project completion. The report would be&#13;
discussed in the next meeting of RCG and specific follow-up measures would be initiated&#13;
by RCG. The report would review the adequacy of implementation measures and report&#13;
on the perceptions of the affected persons. It would also identify critical issues in&#13;
implementation and make recommendations to improve overall effectiveness of the&#13;
resettlement program. The report would also report progress of follow-up initiated by&#13;
SMSC/RCG on the recommendations of the previous monitoring reports.&#13;

ANNEX 9: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Shanghai is located in the Changiiang (Yangtze River) delta plain and is the largest&#13;
and most heavily industrialized urban agglomeration in China. Historically, discharges of&#13;
municipal and industrial wastewater from Shanghai (in excess of 4.8 Mm3/d in 1995) have&#13;
been to the Changjiang and to the middle and lower reaches of the Huangpu River (a&#13;
tributary of the Changjiang) and its tributaries. As a result the latter have become&#13;
increasingly polluted. In particular, discharges to Suzhou Creek, a tributary of the lower&#13;
Huangpu, caused severe degrees of deoxygenation, leading to severe odor problems and&#13;
potential health risk; the pollution of Suzhou Creek was addressed as a priority through the&#13;
Bank-supported Shanghai Sewerage Project-SSPI (Loan 2794/Credit 1 779-CHA)&#13;
coommencing in 1987.&#13;
2.    The Huangpu River serves as the primary source of potable water for Greater&#13;
Shanghai, and the wastewater discharges threaten the sustainability of the Huangpu water&#13;
resource in this respect. To improve the reliability of the quality of the drinking water&#13;
supply the main water supply intake has been relocated further upstream on two occasions,&#13;
to Linjiang in 1987 and to Da Qiao as part of the Shanghai Environment Project-SEP&#13;
(Loan 371 1-CHA), currently under implementation.&#13;
3.    In order to address these concerns the project is focused on sustaining water quality&#13;
in the Huangpu and the Changjiang based on the following:&#13;
(a)   a phased program of provision of sewerage facilities to divert municipal and&#13;
industrial wastewater out of the Huangpu catchment for ultimate discharge&#13;
to the Changjiang, of which the Huangpu is a tributary; and&#13;
(b)   provision of wastewater treatment facilities as necessary to avoid&#13;
deterioration of water quality in the Changjiang.&#13;
4.    Technical support and training would comprise financial and policy initiatives,&#13;
planning, institutional and management reforms, including institutional measures to support&#13;
management and operational capacity-building of the Shanghai Municipal Sewerage&#13;
Company, Ltd. (SMSC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                     ANNEX9&#13;
Administrative and Institutional Framework&#13;
5.    The State Environmental Protection Committee (SEPC) is the highest level of&#13;
authority on environmental policy and includes the State Council and heads of all relevant&#13;
ministries and agencies. The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) functions&#13;
as the secretariat of SEPC and is responsible for all aspects of environmental policy,&#13;
although it shares authority with other agencies for certain natural resources. NEPA sets&#13;
overall policies and regulations governing the provincial and municipal environmental&#13;
protection bureaus (EPBs), including standards for both environmental quality and for&#13;
polluting discharges. Implementation of environmental policy is through the municipal and&#13;
provincial EPBs, who are empowered to develop and apply standards more rigorous than&#13;
the National Standards specified by NEPA if these are required by the local environmental&#13;
conditions.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
6.    The proposed project components comprise:&#13;
(a)   Sewerage and Sanitation Improvements. Investments in trunk conveyors&#13;
and link sewers (about 50 kin) and secondary sewers, serving part of Puxi&#13;
(21.7 km2), Pudong (155.8 km ) and Wujing and Minhang (92.1 kmn), with&#13;
a supporting program of wastewater flow management and connection and&#13;
collection for domestic, industrial and enterprise systems. Improvements in&#13;
storm water drainage, nightsoil and septic tank systems management;&#13;
(b)   Treatment and Disposal Systems. Pretreatment of wastewater, supported&#13;
by the construction of an appropriate tunneled marine outfall at Bailonggang&#13;
for an initial flow capacity of 1.7 Mm3/d, ensuring appropriate arrangements&#13;
for an ultimate system discharge capacity of about 5.0 Mm3/d;&#13;
(c)   Institutional Development and Training. Support and strengthen project&#13;
management, wastewater organizational, financial and urban utility&#13;
operations and management systems; wastewater system rehabilitation,&#13;
monitoring technology and data management; pollution control; and&#13;
training, feasibility studies and future project preparation.&#13;
7.    Of these components only (a) and (b) involve physical works and are therefore&#13;
covered by the EA studies.&#13;
Baseline Data&#13;
8.    Shanghai is the largest and most heavily industrialized conurbation in China,&#13;
producing about 11 percent of national industrial output. Shanghai Municipality, located in&#13;
the Changjiang delta plain, occupies an area of 6,200 kmr, of which 300 km2 are classified&#13;
as urban. The Shanghai Municipality area (population 7.5 million in the 12 districts in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -                     ANNEX9&#13;
Shanghai City and a further 6 million in the adjacent five counties) is bordered to the north&#13;
by Jiangsu Province and to the east by Zhejiang Province.&#13;
9.    The City lies in a convergence zone of cold, dry and warm, humid air masses.&#13;
Rainfall patterns are influenced both by monsoons and temperate cyclones. There are well-&#13;
defined seasons with average monthly temperatures ranging from 3.4°C in January to&#13;
27.2°C in August. Annual average rainfall is 1,148 mm with a pronounced rainy season&#13;
from June to September. The prevailing wind is northwesterly in winter and southeasterly&#13;
in summer.&#13;
10.   The Changjiang is the longest and largest river in China and the fourth largest in the&#13;
world in terms of flow. The river rises on the border with Tibet, and its total catchment area&#13;
of 1.8 million km2 covers approximately 19 percent of the total land area of China. It&#13;
traverses a total of approximately 6,300 river km before discharging to the East China Sea&#13;
to the east of Shanghai. The mean net downstream flow in the Changjiang at its most&#13;
downstream gauging station at Datong (550 km upstream of the confluence with the&#13;
Huangpu) is approximately 30,000 m3/s, with typical dry season flows in the range of&#13;
10,000 to 15,000 m3/s and wet season flows in excess of 50,000 m3/s. On an annual&#13;
average basis the tidal inflow at the river mouth could be approximately 266,000 m3/s,&#13;
almost nine times the average river flow. The inflow on a spring tide could be of the order&#13;
3&#13;
of 5 billion m3.&#13;
11.   The river Huangpu flows through the Shanghai municipal area, flowing into the&#13;
Changjiang at Wusongkou some 18 km to the north of the city. Flows in the Huangpu are&#13;
measured at the gauging station at Mishidu, about 70 km upstream of the confluence with&#13;
the Changjiang. The river is tidal at Mishidu and the mean net downstream flow is&#13;
approximately 340 m3/s, about 1 percent of that in the Changjiang. Under extreme&#13;
conditions of low natural flow in the Huangpu and peak tidal influence from the&#13;
Changjiang, there can be net upward flows at Mishidu for periods of up to several days.&#13;
12.   Water quality in the Changjiang upstream of the confluence with the Huangpu is&#13;
generally good, although poorer at Bailonggang, which is downstream of the Huangpu&#13;
confluence and is also affected by existing wastewater discharges at the shoreline. The&#13;
Changjiang carries very substantial quantities of silt, with suspended solids concentrations&#13;
exceeding 500 mg/I on average and annual silt loads of the order of 500 million tons. In the&#13;
estuary the silt is mainly fine sand and clay, which has a strong adsorption capacity for a&#13;
range of pollutants, particularly heavy metals.&#13;
13.   All sources of the Huangpu are generally of good quality, but water quality in the&#13;
Huangpu declines as it traverses the Shanghai Municipality area as a result of discharges of&#13;
domestic and industrial wastewater and runoff from agricultural areas. Water quality&#13;
problems are exacerbated under conditions of low natural flow in the Huangpu, when the&#13;
tidal influence of the Changjiang causes extensive upstream movement of pollution from&#13;
the lower reaches of the river.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                          ANNEX9&#13;
14.    The quality of the Changjiang, in particular the concentrations of nutrients nitrogen&#13;
and phosphorus, is also important in that it is a major source of water entering Hangzhou&#13;
Bay, which is experiencing problems of Red Tides. The Changjiang receives numerous&#13;
discharges of urban and industrial wastewater and extensive drainage from agricultural&#13;
areas. As a result concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus are high, particularly during&#13;
the dry season when concentrations are of the order of 0.5 mg/l and 0.17 mg/l on average&#13;
respectively, and the Changjiang accounts for some 92 percent of the nutrient loads entering&#13;
Hangzhou Bay.&#13;
15.    The loads are dominated by agriculture (fertilizer runoff) in the case of nitrogen and&#13;
animal wastes in the case of phosphorus. Significant reductions in these loads would&#13;
require comprehensive agricultural waste and fertilizer management on a catchment-wide&#13;
basis.  Typical water quality data for the lower Huangpu at Yangshupu, the most&#13;
downstream water treatment plant intake, and the Changjiang at Xuliujing, upstream of the&#13;
confluence with the Huangpu, and at Bailonggang are given in Table 1 .&#13;

Water Quality and Discharge Standards&#13;
16.    Two categories of national water quality standard are appropriate in respect of water&#13;
quality in the Changjiang and the Huangpu reflecting their various beneficial uses,&#13;
including a source of potable water for Shanghai. These categories are the Environmental&#13;
Quality Standard for Surface Waters (GB 3838-88) and the Sanitary Standard for Drinking&#13;
Water (GB 5749-85). In addition, there is a Shanghai Municipality Environmental Quality&#13;
Standard for Surface Water covering six water quality classes. The National Standard GB&#13;

the requirements for which are given in Table 2. Water to be abstracted for potable supply&#13;
should meet at least the Class III standard.&#13;

Mishidu to Shanghai City and Class IV from Shanghai City downstream. Water quality&#13;
currently frequently fails to comply with these standards. The beneficial uses of the&#13;
Changjiang in the region of the proposed discharge of wastewater from Shanghai at&#13;
Bailonggang are for navigation, drainage and for passage of migratory fish. There are&#13;

National standards for disposal of wastewater to fresh water and marine environments, but&#13;
none specifically for discharges to estuaries. The standards for discharges to fresh water are&#13;
given in Table 3, from which it is apparent that the standards are totally dependent upon the&#13;
beneficial use of the receiving watercourse and are totally concentration based, being&#13;
independent of the flow of either the wastewater discharge or the receiving watercourse.&#13;
The standard most appropriate to a discharge to the Changjiang is the Class II discharge&#13;
standard.&#13;

suspended solids and ammonia. Although not specifically included in the standards, the&#13;
concentration of phosphorus is also of interest in terms of the relative significance of the&#13;
phosphorus load of the Shanghai wastewater in terms of the load of the Changjiang. The&#13;
latter is important in connection with the nutrient status of Hangzhou Bay.&#13;
19.   The concentrations of these paramneters in the ultimate discharge at Bailonggang&#13;
would depend upon water consumption and upon the type of industry in the areas of&#13;
Shanghai served by the sewerage system, in particular the Pudong area. However, the&#13;
composition of the discharge at the existing outfall constructed as part of the First Shanghai&#13;
Sewerage Project (SSPI) is reasonably representative of the prospective discharge at&#13;
Bailonggang in the short term, given the relative proportions of domestic and industrial&#13;
wastewater. This is given in Table 4.&#13;

20.   It is apparent from Table 4 that the Shanghai wastewater is weak, reflecting the high&#13;
water consumption in both the domestic and industrial sectors. The untreated wastewater&#13;
would comply with the ammonia and suspended solids standards and would exceed the&#13;
standards for BOD and COD, as listed in Table 3, on average by about 40 percent and&#13;
30 percent respectively. Concentrations of the other parameters specified in the standard,&#13;
such as toxic metals are substantially lower than the standard limits.&#13;
21.   The impact of the initial wastewater discharge of 1,700,000 m3/d without treatment&#13;
on water quality in the Changjiang at Bailonggang under winter low flow and summer&#13;
conditions has been investigated by means of mathematical modeling. Compliance with the&#13;
Class III fresh water quality standard is achieved at dilutions of the Second Shanghai&#13;
Sewerage Project (SSPII) wastewater by a factor of approximately 50. The mathematical&#13;
modeling studies predicted that the impact of the discharge would be minimal, with the area&#13;
of the immediate mixing zone in which such a level of dilution were not achieved being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

small, between 0.5 and 3.2 km2, depending upon the river flow and the tidal conditions.&#13;
Moreover, it was also calculated that the probability of the wastewater discharge plume&#13;
reaching the surface was less than 5 percent and that the plume would never reach the&#13;
shoreline. Thus a passage for fish migration would be preserved. The modeling also&#13;
indicated that the impact of the ultimate discharge of 5,000,000 m3/d via three outfalls&#13;
would also be small.&#13;
22.  It should be noted also that the freshwater quality standards refer to un-ionized&#13;
ammonia, which under the conditions in the Changjiang would account for about 1 percent&#13;
of the total ammonia concentration. On this basis the concentration of un-ionized ammonia&#13;
would be a maximum of only about 0.01 mg/l and therefore substantially within the Class&#13;
III standard.&#13;
23.  In view of the minimal impact of the immediate term discharge upon water quality&#13;
in the Changjiang, due largely to the very high flows and dilution capacity of the&#13;
Changjiang, and the negative impact of wastewater treatment sludge disposal, it is proposed&#13;
to adopt the following approach to discharge standards, and therefore the degree of&#13;
wastewater treatment required for compliance:&#13;
(a)   pollutants that are toxic or accumulative would be strictly controlled&#13;
immediately, principally at source, and the concentration based standards&#13;
would continue be met; and&#13;
(b)   degradable pollutants such as BOD, COD and ammonia would be controlled&#13;
on a total load basis; the concentration based standards would be imposed&#13;
only in the longer term (2020) and in the intermediate term there would be&#13;
treatment to reduce the pollution loads only when, without such a reduction,&#13;
they would exceed that of the ultimate flow of 5,000,000 m 3/d at the Class II&#13;
standard.&#13;
24.   The growth in loads of BOD, COD and ammonia in the SSPII catchment area are&#13;
shown in Table 5. The growth in BOD and COD loads occurs as a result not only of&#13;
population growth and industrial development but also because of the progressive phasing&#13;
out of the night soil and septic tank systems in favor of direct discharge to sewer systems.&#13;
25.   On this basis it is proposed to provide preliminary treatment (screening and grit&#13;
removal) only in the immediate term. Based on the data in Table 5, it is expected that&#13;
treatrnent of the wastewater discharge at Bailonggang would not become necessary to&#13;
comply with BOD load requirements until about 2015.&#13;
&#13;

26.   However, as referred to above the Changjiang is a major source of nutrints&#13;
discharged to Hangzhou Bay, indicating a need for control of nutrients throughout the&#13;
catchment. Accordingly, as a contribution to reducing the phosphorus load in the&#13;
Changjiang (albeit that the load from Shanghai represents only about 3 percent of this load)&#13;
it is proposed to introduce treatment in the form of chemically assisted primary treatment,&#13;
using iron salts, in 2005, with the immediate objective of reducing the load of phosphorus&#13;
discharged from Shanghai to a limit of 18 tons/day.&#13;
27.   The treatment proposed would sustain the average total phosphorus load from&#13;
Shanghai as a whole at less than the predicted year 2000 levels (18 tons/day) and in addition&#13;
would be sufficient to effect the necessary reduction in BOD and COD to comply with the&#13;
concentration based standards when required. To optimize pretreatrnent process efficiency,&#13;
it is proposed to treat only a proportion of the wastewater flow, but to achieve a very high&#13;
level of phosphorus removal, thereby obtaining the required pollution load reduction. The&#13;
first stage of treatrnent will need to be operational by the year 2005 and would treat a flow&#13;
of about 0.86 Mmn3/d, with extensions to increase treatment capacity to 1.7 Mm3/d in 2010&#13;
and 2.7 Mm3/d in 2015.&#13;
28.   Details of this approach to compliance with wastewater discharge standards have&#13;
been submitted to and discussed with NEPA and have been agreed.&#13;
Consideration of Alternatives&#13;
29.   Alternatives were considered in terms of the routing of the main interceptor sewers,&#13;
the treatment process to be provided to comply ultimately with the discharge standard and&#13;
the type of outfall construction. The alternatives to the selected sewer routes were rejected&#13;
on grounds of greater cost, increased construction difficulties of construction and greater&#13;
disruption. Biological treatment as an alternative to chemically assisted primary treatment&#13;
was rejected on the basis of greater cost, land area requirements and energy consumption.&#13;
30.   The sludge generated by the wastewater treatment process proposed would contain&#13;
substantial proportions of iron, as a result of residues from chemical treatment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                    ANNEX9&#13;
Consequently, the disposal options are expected to be limited. It is proposed that disposal&#13;
would be in an engineered landfill site equipped with suitable environmental control&#13;
facilities and located near the wastewater treatment plant. Incineration was rejected in view&#13;
of the probable insufficient calorific value of the sludge and there is likely to be insufficient&#13;
demand for large scale use in agriculture to be viable.&#13;
31.   Alternatives considered for the wastewater discharge to the Changjiang were&#13;
immersed tube and overhanging bridge structures. Each was rejected on grounds of cost&#13;
and/or interference with navigation.&#13;
Impacts and Mitigation&#13;
32.   The environmental impact of SSPII is on balance substantially positive.  In&#13;
particular there would be a substantial diversion of pollution load from the Huangpu to the&#13;
Changjiang, where the assimilation capacity is very considerable greater. The current and&#13;
projected future BOD loads from Shanghai and their disposal routes are shown in Table 6.&#13;
It may be seen that, although the total BOD load from Shanghai as a whole increases from&#13;
572 t/d to 712 t/d between 1995 and 2015, the wastewater BOD load discharged to the&#13;
Huangpu declines from 116 to 14 t/d and would be small in relation to that from rural&#13;
drainage. Reductions in the nutrient loads arising from rural drainage would require&#13;
improvements in the used of agricultural fertilizer. In addition the load to the Changjiang&#13;
from the southern outfall sewer would be discharged 1.6 km offshore, removing the&#13;
pollution of the coastal water currently occurring as a result of the present discharge at the&#13;
shoreline.&#13;

33.   The principal potential negative environmental impacts are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Water Quality: impact of the wastewater discharge on the water quality in&#13;
the Changjiang;&#13;
Outcome: As discussed above the potential impact of the discharge&#13;
upon water quality in the Changjiang is minimal, with deterioration&#13;
of water quality only in the immediate mixing zone of area 0.5 to&#13;
3.2 km2;&#13;
(b)   Sludge Disposal: impact of disposal of any sludge generated by wastewater&#13;
treatment;&#13;
Outcome: The sludge disposal route proposed, in view of the&#13;
chemical treatment residues in the sludge, would be based on&#13;
dewatering and disposal at a dedicated engineered landfill close to&#13;
the treatment plant site.&#13;
(c)   Spoil Disposal: impact of disposal of construction spoil (excavation and&#13;
tunneling);&#13;
Outcome: Quantities of excavation and tunneling spoil generated&#13;
by the project would probably be in the order of 1.3 Mm3. A&#13;
detailed spoil disposal plan would be prepared. However, such spoil&#13;
is generally regarded in Shanghai as a resource rather than a waste&#13;
material in view of the large demands in other major projects under&#13;
construction. It is expected that all spoil from SSPII would be used&#13;
either in the construction of the proposed Outer Ring Road or in land&#13;
reclamation projects. Where contaminated spoil is generated, as a&#13;
result of excavation in industrial areas, disposal would be under&#13;
controlled conditions in suitable landfill sites.&#13;
(d)   Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Land acquisition and resettlement&#13;
would be necessary in respect of the construction of trunk sewers and the&#13;
treatment plant. There would also be enforced land use changes.&#13;
Outcome:  Issues and excepted outcomes in relation to land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement are discussed in detail in Annex 8.&#13;
34.   In addition there would be a number of less significant impacts as described below.&#13;
(a)   Construction Impacts. There would be a number of impacts relating to&#13;
construction activities, such as noise, traffic disruption and temporary&#13;
problems of access. Working practices would be controlled to minimize&#13;
these impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -                           ANNEX9&#13;
(b)    Cultural and Historical Sites. No known cultural or historical site would&#13;
be crossed by the route of the trunk sewers or the related works proposed in&#13;
the project. However, in the event that during excavation archeological&#13;
remains are discovered, it is proposed to halt work temporarily while&#13;
appropriate specialists assess the significance of the findings.&#13;
(c)    Terrestrial Environment. There are limited natural or even semi-natural&#13;
habitats along the routes of the trunk sewers or at the treatment plant site.&#13;
Ecological impact of the project construction would be slight.&#13;

ANNEX 13: SHANGHAI MUNICIPAL SEWERAGE&#13;
COMPANY, LTD. (SMSC) FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
1.    Assumptions to the projections of the main financial statements of the Shanghai&#13;
Municipal Sewerage Company, Ltd. (SMSC) for the period 1996-2003 are provided below.&#13;
2.    Inflation and Exchange Rates. Yearly general domestic inflation rates used in the&#13;
projections are 10.6 percent in 1996, 8.5 percent in 1997, 7.0 percent in 1998, 6.5 percent in&#13;
1999 and 6.2 percent in 2000-03. Foreign price increases are estimated at 2.6 percent for&#13;
each of years 1996-2003. The initial exchange rate used to convert foreign costs to local&#13;
currency, where applicable, was Y 8.4 per $1.0. It is assumed that exchange rate&#13;
adjustments would, on average, maintain purchasing power parity over the projection&#13;
period.&#13;
Income Statement&#13;
3.    Sales. Projections of sewerage quantities are based on the "medium demand"&#13;
figures of the Shanghai Municipal Water Company (SMWC), which would add capacity,&#13;
when needed, so as not to constrain demand. Sewerage quantities are assumed to be&#13;
100 percent of water supplied and billed to SMWC's domestic consumers, and 90 percent&#13;
of water supplied to nondomestic consumers. As there is a joint billing arrangement&#13;
between SMWC and SMSC for domestic consumers, it is assumed that 100 percent of the&#13;
sewerage billed would be collected. For nondomestic consumers, it is assumed that&#13;
95 percent of these customers can be billed by SMSC from 1996, with 80 percent being&#13;
billed in 1995. Other operating revenue for SMSC is derived from the proceeds of the&#13;
5 percent public utility additional tax collected by SMWC as part of its water supply tariffs,&#13;
which would be tumed over to SMSC periodically. Nonoperating income includes transfers&#13;
from SMG to cover the costs incurred by SMSC in stormwater removal, estimated to be&#13;
23.5 percent of SMSC's operations and maintenance costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103 -                      ANNEX 13&#13;
4.    Average Tariff. The following average prices in Yuan per m3 in current terms are&#13;
projected in order to meet SMG's financial objectives for SMSC, including making a&#13;
contribution to capital investment of 5 percent in years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, and&#13;
10 percent in years 2001 to 2003:&#13;
1996     1997      1998      1999     2000      2001     2002      2003&#13;
0.35     0.35      0.38      0.44     0.46      0.69      0.69     0.76&#13;
5.    Operating Costs. Salaries, wages and staff benefits are assumed to increase at the&#13;
rates given in para. 2 above. Materials and other costs are assumed to increase in line with&#13;
general inflation also. Power costs are based on a special municipal utility tariff of&#13;
Y 0.30/kWh for 1995, increasing in line with general inflation. For both existing assets and&#13;
assets to be constructed under the project, maintenance costs have been estimated in&#13;
accordance with established engineering norms, and increase in line with general inflation.&#13;
Long-term assets are depreciated at 2.5 percent (40 years) and short-term assets at&#13;
6.67 percent (15 years). The split of assets is assumed at 80 percent long-term and&#13;
20 percent short-term, based on the project cost estimates and information supplied from&#13;
SSC. The composite depreciation rate is 3.8 percent. It is assumed SSC would pay a&#13;
business tax of 3.7 percent a year, but no income tax.&#13;
6.    Interest and Amortization Expenses. The proceeds of the IBRD loan are assumed&#13;
to be onlent to SMSC at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single&#13;
currency loans (which was 5.97 percent per year at the time of negotiations), and&#13;
0.75 percent per year commitment charge over 15 years, including 5 years of grace. Interest&#13;
is paid annually. Amortization of loans would be on an annuity basis. SMSC would bear&#13;
the foreign exchange risk. Shanghai Municipality would provide the balance of counterpart&#13;
funding requirements as capital grants.&#13;
Balance Sheet&#13;
7.    Inventories.  Inventories are assumed to be 15 percent of chemicals and&#13;
maintenance materials, and have been projected to take into account general inflation as&#13;
well as any expanded levels of operations and construction; 2 months lag in payments&#13;
8.    Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are assumed to be about 7 days of&#13;
billings from 1996. This short collection period is based on the following: (a) domestic&#13;
water bills are collected on behalf of SMSC by SMWC, which has a proven efficient&#13;
collection process (under 10 days); and (b) nondomestic accounts are collected by SMSC&#13;
through direct debit.&#13;
9.    Bad Debts. Bad debts are assumed to be 2.0 percent of billings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104 -                       ANNEX 13&#13;
10.   Accounts Payable. Accounts payable are assumed to be 2 months of chemicals,&#13;
utilities and maintenance materials from 1996.&#13;
Source and Application of Funds&#13;
11.   Working Capital Needs. Working capital needs represent the excess, or otherwise,&#13;
of the current year's current assets (net of cash), less the excess of the previous year's&#13;
current assets (net of cash) over current liabilities.&#13;
12.   Change in Cash.  Change in cash (which includes short-term  investments)&#13;
calculates the balance sheet cash balance for the current year.&#13;

PROJECTIONS&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
1.    The assumptions made when calculating the projections of the on-budget revenue&#13;
and expenditure statements of the Shanghai Municipal Government (SMG) for the period&#13;
1994-2002 are set out below. On-budget revenues are those arising from taxes levied on&#13;
enterprises operating in the Shanghai Municipal area; off-budget revenues consist of special&#13;
fees to enterprises and are used chiefly for capital expenditures.&#13;
Revenue Forecast&#13;
2.    The actual (1990-94) on-budget revenue figures have been derived from data&#13;
provided by SMG. Between 1990 and 1993, the average annual increase in revenue was&#13;
about 15.5 percent. In 1994, however, the Central Government restructured the tax system,&#13;
bolstering its share. As a result, there was a 28 percent decline in revenue in 1994 from&#13;
1993. To estimate future revenues, a conservative estimate of an average annual increase of&#13;
10 percent in nominal terms has been assumed using 1994 as the base year.&#13;
Expenditure Forecast&#13;
3.    Historically, on-budget expenditures have represented about 50 percent of on-&#13;
budget revenues. In 1994, however, they jumped to 110 percent of that year's revenue as&#13;
the tax system was restructured (para. 2). No adjustment was made to the expenditure&#13;
program. To estimate future expenditures, the ratio of expenditures to revenues is assumed&#13;
to decline to about 80 percent of revenues in 1995; 68 percent in 1996; and 58 percent&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
4.    Table 1 summarizes the actual revenues and expenditures from 1990 to 1994, and&#13;
estimated revenues and expenditures from 1995 to 2002. The details are provided in Tables&#13;
2 and 3 of this Annex.&#13;

-114-                      ANNEX 15&#13;
ANNEX 15: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    The April 1992 Environmental Strategy Paper for China (9669-CHA) and the&#13;
recently completed Urban Environmental Services Management sector study (13073-CHA)&#13;
showed that decades of slighting environmental protection to maximize investment in&#13;
industrial production has now created a critical threat to the sustainability of growth in&#13;
China. The threat manifests itself in almost all areas of the country, but is particularly acute&#13;
in large urban areas, where the concentration of population and economic activity has led&#13;
more rapidly to an overloading of the absorptive capacity of the environment. In response,&#13;
the Bank has formulated an urban environmental lending strategy that uses price-driven&#13;
incentives to reduce effluents and pay for their handling and treatment, while also assisting&#13;
in the long-neglected task of providing a physical infrastructure that can provide services&#13;
and manage pollution in the most cost-effective manner.&#13;
2.    The choice to work in Shanghai follows directly from the Bank's strategy. As the&#13;
largest and most developed urban area of China, Shanghai has long served as a model for&#13;
China's urban and industrial development. Shanghai has the oldest industrial base of all&#13;
Chinese cities, but the pressure to remit a very high percentage of profits to the national&#13;
government has until very recently seriously constrained Shanghai's ability to invest in&#13;
social infrastructure. By the early 1980s, that underinvestment had resulted in rapidly&#13;
increasing transportation costs over an antiquated road network; in industrial effluent&#13;
discharges far exceeding national standards, often discharged directly into waterways used&#13;
for industrial and drinking water supply; in uncontrolled hazardous waste disposal; and in&#13;
solid waste disposal into landfills with no provision for leachate control. Little attention&#13;
had been given to systematic evaluation of these problems either singly or, most&#13;
importantly, in their cumulative impact.&#13;
3.    Since 1984 the Bank has been working with Shanghai to address this range of&#13;
problems. Transportation constraints are being eased through Shanghai Metropolitan&#13;
Transport Projects I and II (Credit 2296 and Loan 3652), which finance transportation&#13;
planning, improved traffic management, and investment in key urban roads. The first step&#13;
in the long-term program to end the direct discharge of effluents into municipal waters, the&#13;
Shanghai Sewerage Project-SSPI (Loan 2794/Credit 1779), captures the waste- and&#13;
stormwater discharges in downtown Shanghai for preliminary treatment and disposal&#13;
through an outfall on the Yangtze, relieving pressure on the most highly polluted waters in&#13;
the urban core of the municipality. The Shanghai Environment Project-SEP (Loan 3711)&#13;
addresses a wide array of problems, including that of a safe source for the city water supply,&#13;
improved solid waste handling, and the sewering of a major industrial district. Those Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115-                      ANNEX15&#13;
loans and credits have speeded the infrastructure construction program, but much more&#13;
remains to be done.&#13;
4.    The sewerage works under SSPI were not the first in the city. Indeed, Shanghai had&#13;
some of the earliest wastewater treatment facilities in China, with the first plant&#13;
commissioned in 1926. Between then and 1978, 11 more plants were commissioned, most&#13;
of them handling no more than 40,000 m3/day and all discharging to the Huangpu or its&#13;
tributaries. These plants operate at less than half their design capacity and handle about&#13;
3 percent of Shanghai's average dry-weather flows, most at the secondary treatment level.&#13;
In 1970 and 1971, two large interceptors were constructed to divert wastewater from&#13;
Shanghai to the Changjiang (Yangtze River), one serving the northern edge of the city and&#13;
the other the southern. These discharge about 18 percent of urban flows through untreated&#13;
surface discharge. Those interceptors did not attempt to deal with the difficult challenge of&#13;
intercepting flows from the densely populated inner city neighborhoods. This was first&#13;
done in the SSPI works, commissioned in 1994, which pick up an additional 25 percent of&#13;
the flows and, as noted above, discharge them to the Changjiang after preliminary&#13;
treatment. The remaining 54 percent of urban wastewater discharges directly, and typically&#13;
without treatment, to the small canals found across the city, or to the Huangpu River.&#13;
5.    Shanghai is built on a fluvial plain showing very little variation in elevation, ranging&#13;
between 3.5 to 4.5 meters above mean sea level. The municipality is laced with rivers and&#13;
2                             2&#13;
canals, averaging some 7 km/kmn  overall, and a higher 8.5 km/km  in Pudong. The&#13;
Huangpu River, which is tidal along its entire length in Shanghai, discharges an average of&#13;
340 m /sec. Puxi, with the bulk of the population and economic activity, sits on the western&#13;
bank of the Huangpu. The Pudong district, the Shanghai Municipal Government's (SMG)&#13;
focal point for future development, is located to the east of the Huangpu in a triangle of land&#13;
bounded on two sides by the Huangpu and the Changjiang. The surface waters tributary to&#13;
the Huangpu forn a network, much of which has no source aside from the Huangpu, the&#13;
Changjiang, stormwater runoff and domestic, industrial, and commercial wastewater&#13;
discharges. The wastewater discharges total some 65 m3/sec.&#13;
6.    The minor waterways serve a variety of functions, including transport, industrial&#13;
water source, washing water, waste receptor, and (in Pudong) potable water source. To&#13;
control flows in the minor waterways, most are gated at the point they join the Huangpu or&#13;
the Changjiang. While the gates prevent high tides from causing flooding, they also create&#13;
stagnant bodies of water with very little self-flushing capacity. The results of this are quite&#13;
apparent if one compares indicators from the Huangpu and some of the tributary water&#13;
bodies, as shown in Table I below.&#13;
7.    Pudong potable water comes in part from three treatment plants drawing from&#13;
surface waters, including one at Yaoshi (see table above). Puxi potable water is drawn from&#13;
the Huangpu, with most of the extraction well upstream of the Suzhou Creek point shown&#13;
in the following table.&#13;

8.    Two factors have an important impact on the quality of the effluents discharging to&#13;
these water bodies.  These are the nightsoil system and industrial pretreatment of&#13;
wastewater. The nightsoil system keeps much of the household waste out of the local&#13;
waters. Within Shanghai, some 2.5 million people collect their nightsoil in buckets emptied&#13;
daily to public dumping stations. Also, many of the private and public toilets discharge to&#13;
holding or septic tanks. In 1992, the bucket system handled 3,780 tons/day and the septic&#13;
tanks 2,850 tons/day. Of this, 83 percent fertilizes crops on suburban farms, while the&#13;
remainder is dumped to urban drains. Because of this diversion, city wastewaters tend to be&#13;
quite dilute, with recent measurements at the SSPI outfall showing BOD of only 85 mg/I, in&#13;
contrast to the 200 mg/l that might be expected in a full strength domestic wastewater. The&#13;
rebuilding of Shanghai would allow most of the population access to flush toilets within 25&#13;
years, and that, combined with a program to connect septic tanks to the wastewater&#13;
reticulation system, would increase domestic loads on the system.&#13;
9.   Industry accounts for about 46 percent of Shanghai's wastewater flow and about&#13;
37 percent of the COD load. The relatively weak industrial wastewater (COD of about&#13;
190 mg/I, BOD about 45 mg/1) probably results from discharge of cooling water to sewers,&#13;
or, for plants near surface water supplies, dilution of waste streams with surface water to&#13;
meet the concentration-based pollution standards used in China. New industries are not&#13;
permitted to discharge untreated wastes to surface waters. Licensing procedures designed&#13;
to ensure compliance with this rule are administered by the Environmental Protection&#13;
Bureau (EPB) and the urban planning bureaus. In Pudong, all new enterprises must connect&#13;
to city sewers. Unfortunately, the capacity to absorb these flows has not been put in place&#13;
and illegal discharges to surface waters are not unknown. All alternatives to improve&#13;
handling of Shanghai wastewaters discussed below have, as an element of their strategy,&#13;
better industrial compliance with discharge standards. To achieve that goal requires&#13;
political commitment to the enforcement of those standards. Disregard of standards&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-117 -                     ANNEX 15&#13;
becomes more difficult when enterprises connect to sewers, for their wastewater becomes&#13;
subject to inspection by the Shanghai Municipal Sewerage Company, Ltd. (SMSC) in&#13;
addition to the EPB. That company has the power to fine firms that exceed quality&#13;
standards and a strong interest in identifying violators, for illegal discharges can threaten the&#13;
physical fabric of the sewerage system and any treatment processes that may be in use.&#13;
10.   SMG's wastewater handling strategy was laid out in the 1984 Wastewater Master&#13;
Plan, which has been elaborated through feasibility and design work for the SSPI and SEP&#13;
projects. Major findings of the Master Plan were that preliminary treatment and discharge&#13;
to the Changjiang would be about half as expensive as intercepting the current flows into&#13;
the Huangpu and providing secondary treatment before discharge. At the same time,&#13;
Changjiang discharges could maintain water quality goals for the Changjiang, if the river&#13;
outfalls were properly designed. The Master Plan contains details of the analysis, but the&#13;
intuitive appeal of the finding can be appreciated simply from comparing the 65 m3/sec&#13;
current wastewater flows from Shanghai to the 340 m3/sec average and 90 m3/sec low flows&#13;
of the Huangpu and the 31,000 m3/sec average and 7,000 m3/sec low flows of the&#13;
Changjiang.&#13;
11.   Maintenance of Huangpu water quality affects both municipal and industrial water&#13;
supplies. The new municipal raw water intake is at Daqiao, on the Huangpu above urban&#13;
Shanghai, but emergency raw water abstraction points are all below Daqiao and threatened&#13;
by discharges. The raw water below the current intake at Linjiang is untreatable to national&#13;
and the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water quality guidelines when using&#13;
economically feasible methods, and at the intake, it usually fails some WHO and Chinese&#13;
drinking water quality recommendations at all times and fails by a large margin in the two&#13;
summer low flow months. The water treatment plants in the system can insure that&#13;
coliform bacteria counts are held well under WHO guidelines, but are unable to cope with&#13;
oil, phenols, and ammonia that seasonally continue above safe levels. As a result, Shanghai&#13;
consumers have continued to suffer from drinking water virtually unpalatable out of the tap&#13;
for up to two months each year. Domestic users further treat the water by boiling (which&#13;
can reduce the more volatile pollutants), and higher income families can avoid the problem&#13;
through use of activated carbon filters or the purchase of bottled water. The latter remedies&#13;
are not accessible to the poorer members of the population, although the basic supply of&#13;
piped water remains extremely inexpensive by international standards. Fish no longer live&#13;
in the urban reaches of the Huangpu and recreational and aesthetic values of the river are&#13;
similarly affected by low water quality.&#13;
Proposed Project&#13;
12.   SMG has requested Bank assistance in financing the second stage of Shanghai's&#13;
wastewater development program through the Second Shanghai Sewerage Project (SSPII).&#13;
This would involve further improvement in the management of the municipal system and&#13;
construction of interceptors and conveyors capturing an additional 31 percent of municipal&#13;
flows, over and above the 48 percent currently intercepted. The remaining 21 percent&#13;
would be intercepted in subsequent phases of Shanghai's wastewater development program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-118-                      ANNEX1S&#13;
The stage currently proposed for Bank financing would capture the Wujing/Minhang flows&#13;
sewered under SEP, and the Puxi and Pudong flows that would otherwise discharge to the&#13;
upper Huangpu. The program (see Annex 3 for a detailed description) involves&#13;
construction of approximately 41.1 km of major wastewater conveyors, associated pumping&#13;
stations, preliminary treatment, and discharge through a deep-water outfall.  The&#13;
interception of current discharges would significantly increase the quality of Pudong surface&#13;
water, taking strain off of the current water intakes, raise the quality of the Longhua Gang&#13;
and Puhui Tang sections of the Puxi network, and modestly improve Huangpu water quality&#13;
at the new raw water intake. Expected improvements have been modeled, with a sample of&#13;
the results shown below:&#13;

Note: DO: Dissolved Oxygen; BOD: Biological Oxygen Demand (5-day); COD: Chemical&#13;
Oxygen Demand. Source: EA Report, pp 4-3, 8-3.&#13;
13.   Similar modeling has not been done for the Puxi sections of Longhua Gang and&#13;
Puxi Tang. These creeks are connected through a complex network and the modeling&#13;
results are very sensitive to tidal impacts, themselves dependent on gate management&#13;
regimes. However, once local connections to the conveyor are complete, wastewater&#13;
discharges to these waters would cease and the primary source of their water would then be&#13;
stormwater runoff and the Huangpu, itself at an acceptable quality. As the above table&#13;
shows, the water quality improvement on the Huangpu would be on the order of 10 percent&#13;
for most indicators. This improvement would not change the water quality class of the&#13;
Huangpu, but would provide additional protection against any other sources of&#13;
deterioration. Furthermore, the conveyors would provide significant protection against&#13;
accidental industrial discharges of toxics, which previously would have entered the river.&#13;
14.   The Pudong water quality improvements are remarkable. At all modeled points the&#13;
reduction in COD is no less than 45 percent and of BOD no less than 66 percent. Dissolved&#13;
oxygen increases to no less than 3.9 mg/l, with most nodes above 4.5 mg/. For the Pudong&#13;
area, waters go from worse than Class V to no worse than Class IV and, at several nodes,&#13;
Class III. Moreover, the new system would protect those waters from deterioration as total&#13;
Pudong wastewater flows as much as double over the coming two decades.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-119-                       ANNEX15&#13;
15.   The tariffs enacted to finance the construction and operation of the works would&#13;
encourage careful use of water and reduce the size of the conveyors and other works needed&#13;
to meet future discharges. Teclnical assistance would allow company management to&#13;
make efficient use of their income in meeting current and future needs.&#13;
Economic Evaluation&#13;
16.   The economic analysis of the project is reviewed in the main text, and further&#13;
amplified in this Annex. The proposed investment program would protect and improve the&#13;
quality of surface water in Shanghai and, as a consequence, enhance its value for drinking,&#13;
industrial, and agricultural use while minimizing any health threats. Further benefits would&#13;
come from recreational and aesthetic value increases. Attributing specific values to these&#13;
improvements would require a sophisticated model of the entire Huangpu basin system (and&#13;
part of the downstream Changjiang system) linking polluting inputs, water quality&#13;
outcomes, and the relationship of those to the uses noted above. The complexity of&#13;
attributing results to a specific project is engendered in part by the fact that other projects,&#13;
such as SSPI and SEP, as well as industrial relocation and pollution control efforts, would&#13;
be coming on line over the implementation period of this project. All of these change the&#13;
structure of polluting inputs or the risk created by those inputs. Rather than attempt to build&#13;
a model capturing these inputs and outputs, the economic analysis rests on the generally&#13;
accepted importance of capturing and safely disposing urban wastewater flows. The main&#13;
challenge for engineering and economic analysis has been to identify the least-cost strategy&#13;
to sustainably meet the national and local surface water quality standards that represent a&#13;
consensus on desirable water quality.&#13;
17.   The no-project alternative currently results in pollution levels that cause&#13;
unacceptable risk to Shanghai residents and their municipal and industrial water supplies.&#13;
The 1984 master plan used experience with Changjiang conveyors built during the 1970s,&#13;
and the long history of running treatment plants, to establish that the least-cost strategy&#13;
would involve building additional conveyors to handle remaining untreated flows. That&#13;
analysis was confirmed during Bank appraisal of SSPI, at which time the highest priority&#13;
investment was deemed to be capturing and conveying wastewater discharging into the&#13;
downtown area (Suzhou Creek) and surrounding waters. Following the completion of the&#13;
first-phase investment, now operational, 52 percent of wastewater was still inadequately&#13;
collected. In the long run, virtually all wastewater must be intercepted if local waters are to&#13;
be maintained at a quality that allows safe industrial usage, human contact, and eventually&#13;
the return of fish to the lower Huangpu. The Shanghai Municipal Government, in a 1994&#13;
update of the 1984 Master Plan, confirmed the priority in providing new sewerage services&#13;
to be (a) the Wujing/Minhang districts; (b) Puxi South Block; (c) Pudong New Area;&#13;
(d) Puxi Middle Block; and (e) Puxi North Block.&#13;
18.   The priorities were based on projected flow increases to the year 2020, the nature of&#13;
the effluent from a given district, and the area that would suffer from the impact of that&#13;
effluent. Of the unserved districts, Wujing/Minhang is both the most heavily industrialized&#13;
and the furthest upstream. Their proximity to the existing and new raw water intakes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-120 -                     ANNEX 15&#13;
supplying 90 percent of Shanghai's potable water reinforced the concern that they be&#13;
properly sewered, as the risk of catastrophic accidental industrial discharges is greatest in&#13;
Wujing/Minhang. The remaining districts are of two types: districts with mixed domestic,&#13;
commercial, and industrial waste streams quite similar to those handled under SSPI; and the&#13;
Pudong district, the new development zone that has large amounts of greenfield industrial,&#13;
commercial, and residential development. Taking advantage of the new development of&#13;
Pudong, separate sewers for foul water and drainage are being installed there. In the built-&#13;
up areas of Shanghai, the present combined systems would be maintained because of the&#13;
prohibitive cost of retrofitting separate systems.&#13;
19.   Given these characteristics of the remaining districts, the highest priority goes to&#13;
upstream effluents, reflecting the larger area of impact of the upstream discharges. Pudong&#13;
spans the Puxi south, middle, and north blocks, but the use of separate systems in Pudong&#13;
makes it important to pick up the undiluted foul water flows. Furthermore, much of Pudong&#13;
now drains to the existing Southern Sewer, the load on which already equals its design&#13;
capacity of 4.6 m3/sec. The rapid development of Pudong can be accommodated only with&#13;
additional interceptor capacity.&#13;
20.   Shanghai's priority ranking for further work, as described above, has been used to&#13;
develop a phased investment program in wastewater handling. Construction of link sewers&#13;
in Wujing/Minhang, the highest priority area, has begun with support under the Shanghai&#13;
Environment Project. The scope of the present project was determined by matching the&#13;
availability of funds to the work needed to connect and convey wastewaters from each of&#13;
the remaining districts. The proposed program is thus the next phase of the work&#13;
envisioned under the updated 1984 Sewerage Master Plan.&#13;
21.   In the current phase, SMG has judged, and the Bank has affirmed, that its financial&#13;
resources permit a project of approximately Y 5,970 million ($633 million). Least-cost&#13;
analysis, as discussed below, has shown that such a program could capture and safely&#13;
discharge effluent from Wujing/Minhang, Puxi South Block, and Pudong. Puxi Middle&#13;
Block and North Block would await the availability of additional funds, with construction&#13;
unlikely to commence before the year 2000.&#13;
Least-Cost Analysis&#13;
22.   The analysis proceeds on a district-by-district basis, reflecting the accepted&#13;
priorities. Fundamental decisions were made for Wujing/Minhang prior to this project.&#13;
They involved possible discharge points for Wujing/Minhang wastewaters, for which&#13;
possibilities ranged from the Hangzhou Bay in the south, north to an area above the chosen&#13;
discharge point of Bailonggang. Although feasibility studies showed it to be financially&#13;
least cost, discharge to Hangzhou Bay was eventually dismissed as an option due to the&#13;
Bay's ecological fragility. The decision was therefore made to discharge to the north,&#13;
through the conveyor that would also pick up Puxi and Pudong loads.&#13;
23.   Least-cost disposal options for Pudong and the suburban counties of Shanghai have&#13;
also been carried out.  For projected flows to the year 2020, eight scenarios were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-121-                       ANNEX 15&#13;
constructed. The first three discharge to Hangzhou Bay, the next three to the Huangpu, and&#13;
the last two to the Changjiang estuary. For each discharge location, a variety of treatment&#13;
options was considered, and their expected impact on the receiving waters calculated. Full&#13;
details are in the project files ("Strategic Planning Report"), but can be summarized by&#13;
noting that none of the Hangzhou Bay discharge options left that water body with&#13;
acceptable quality. The only Huangpu option that maintained water quality within limits&#13;
involved secondary treatment of all Pudong flows, at an economic NPV (12 percent&#13;
discount rate) of some Y 16,988 million. The two Changjiang discharge scenarios did not&#13;
significantly degrade that water body, although it was noted that background phosphorus&#13;
levels at the outfall already exceeded surface water quality standards and the Pudong/Puxi&#13;
flows would add another 3 percent to those levels. The two Changjiang discharge scenarios&#13;
included one providing preliminary treatment, and costing Y 4,754 million; and another&#13;
providing enhance primary treatment, and costing Y 6,140 million. Clearly, for Pudong, the&#13;
Changjiang discharge option is far less costly than the Huangpu option, and entails less&#13;
environmental risk.&#13;
Discharge Sites&#13;
24.   Given the choice of Changjiang discharge, discharge sites themselves need least-&#13;
cost evaluation. In the case of this project, however, the choice was determined largely by&#13;
the existence of a surface outfall at Bailonggang, the exit point of the Southern Interceptor.&#13;
Alternative sites were considered, but none had immediately obvious advantages over&#13;
Bailonggang and the high cost of modeling studies to determine suitability of a site&#13;
suggested that a sequential pass/fail evaluation of possible alternatives, beginning with&#13;
Bailonggang, would he the most efficient selection mechanism.  In the event, the&#13;
Bailonggang studies demonstrated that with proper outfall design, the site would be&#13;
appropriate, and it was therefore accepted.&#13;
Wastewater Conveyor Routing&#13;
25.   The next stage of analysis involved optimizing the conveyor routing to capture&#13;
flows and deliver them to Bailonggang. Here, seven routing options were considered (for&#13;
details see project files "Feasibility Report," Vol. 2), each constrained to an outfall at the&#13;
current site of the Southern Sewer outfall at Bailonggang and at least one of the river&#13;
crossings at the site of the Outer Ring Road Crossing. All options envisage a possible&#13;
second outfall 7 km south of Bailonggang to handle augmented flows if Pudong&#13;
development proceeds as anticipated. Differences among the options relate principally to&#13;
the numnber of river crossings, sizes of various sections, and connections between existing&#13;
and planned conveyors for flow balancing purposes. Environmental impacts also vary&#13;
among the options. The table below summarizes the average incremental cost (AIC)&#13;
economic cost for each option, evaluated at a 12 percent discount rate:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-122 -                     ANNEX 15&#13;

1                     1.53&#13;
2                     1.53&#13;
3                     1.50&#13;
4                     1.54&#13;
5                     1.69&#13;
6                     1.76&#13;
7                     1.67&#13;
26.   All options include the economic value of land acquired for the project. Options 1&#13;
through 4 have measurably lower economic cost than options 5 through 7; however, the&#13;
apparent cost differences among I through 4 and among 5 through 7 are within the bounds&#13;
of costing accuracy and should not be considered significant. The options do not all imply&#13;
equal outcomes. Option 5 has the advantage of intercepting more wastewater in stage one,&#13;
hence has a greater, for a short term, positive impact on the Huangpu. Option 6 leads to the&#13;
least resettlement because it relies on only one conveyor line, while all other options use&#13;
two lines. Option 6 also relies solely on the Bailonggang outfall, an area of proven&#13;
assimilative capacity. Options I and 2 necessitate the removal of 4 road and 9 foot bridges&#13;
during construction, which would have a considerable, uncosted impact on users. The&#13;
option I and 2 routing also would require some difficult construction along a narrow canal.&#13;
Option 4 would require a connection crossing the most densely populated area of Shanghai&#13;
and only a tunnel connection would be feasible. Reconnaissance did not reveal an obvious&#13;
site for tunnel access shafts, and given the disruption to an already excessively congested&#13;
downtown area, this option would be preferred only if it promised substantial cost savings&#13;
compared to other options.&#13;
27.   Option 3 was chosen as the least cost of the considered options, given the uncosted&#13;
environmental impacts and construction risks inherent in Options 1, 2, and 4. The&#13;
advantages of option 6 were judged to be outweighed by the 16 percent cost increase it&#13;
would entail.&#13;
Wastewater Conveyor Sizing&#13;
28.   The conveyor costs are very sensitive to sizing. Under the current strategy, the&#13;
conveyors would be sized to handle estimated flows up to the year 2006, at which time&#13;
additional conveyors would have to be built. The anticipated future investment program,&#13;
system financing requirements, and, ultimately, cost of the service are very sensitive to&#13;
changes in wastewater production. That, in turn, is a function of water demand and the use&#13;
of any processes that may minimize wastewater output. The current SMG estimates for&#13;
water demand reflect historical water and wastewater pricing regimes, in which water prices&#13;
have fallen substantially in relation to income and wastewater prices have historically been&#13;
zero. Based on these assumptions, the year 2020 per capita domestic water demand&#13;
(medium growth scenario) is estimated to be 280 lcd. This can be compared to Hong Kong,&#13;
where current demand levels are about 260 lcd. The Hong Kong experience, where real&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-123 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
income levels are higher than can be expected for Shanghai in 2020 and penetration of&#13;
water-using labor-saving appliances is very high, suggests that 260 lcd might serve as a&#13;
high estimate for Shanghai 2020 domestic consumption. The impact of sizing conveyors is&#13;
discussed in the main text of the Appraisal Report (para. 6.13).&#13;
Treatment&#13;
29.   The outfall modeling studies have shown that untreated discharges through&#13;
Bailonggang up to BOD loads of 294 t/day would not result in significant (i.e., one or more&#13;
water quality class) deterioration of the Changjiang estuary. As initial flows are estimated&#13;
to contain BOD loads of about 145 t/day, the initial treatment strategy is confined to&#13;
preliminary treatment, which itself protects the pumps and outfalls. However, Changjiang&#13;
water quality as it enters the Shanghai area fails to meet some of the parameters of the&#13;
surface water quality III standards, and Shanghai's discharges could further increase&#13;
pressure on that quality. Of particular interest is total phosphorus loads, because of their&#13;
possible contribution to red tides in Hangzhou Bay and the East China sea.&#13;
30.   The proposed treatment strategy would be designed to hold the average annual&#13;
phosphorus loads at a level no higher than their year 2000 discharges (the year full&#13;
operations would begin). To achieve this, chemically enhanced primary treatment would be&#13;
introduced in stages from about the year 2005 onward. To meet that goal, sufficient land&#13;
would be acquired at the Bailonggang site to build those treatment facilities. Furthermore,&#13;
the preliminary treatment works would be designed to facilitate the addition of primary&#13;
treatment.&#13;
Risks&#13;
31.   The proposed project faces or mitigates a variety of risks. Those risks are here&#13;
grouped into four types: implementation and operational risks; regulatory risk; risk to water&#13;
supply; and risks to long term sustainability. Each type of risk is discussed below.&#13;
Implementation and Operation Risks&#13;
32.   These risks include a variety of physical, institutional, and economic factors that&#13;
could interfere with the timely construction or operation of any of the project elements.&#13;
These include:&#13;
(a)   Financial Risks: These risks are of two sorts, those of counterpart funding&#13;
and operational funding. As to counterpart funding, the project would&#13;
require an investment of some $633.3 million, a significant portion of the&#13;
Shanghai infrastructure investment budget. Of that, the proposed Bank loan&#13;
would provide $250 million, and the wastewater company and SMG would&#13;
need to identify sources for the remaining $383.3 million. The risk of&#13;
counterpart funding problems has been minimized through design&#13;
optimization to minimize cost and SMG agreement to implement sewerage&#13;
tariffs sufficient to cover O&amp;M costs, debt service and a meaningful&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-124 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
contribution to future capital investments. SMG also has a strong incentive&#13;
to ensure timely provision of counterpart funding, for the realization of the&#13;
Pudong development strategy requires facilities to move wastewater out of&#13;
the area. The proposed project would provide those facilities. Good&#13;
counterpart funding perfonnance during SSPI gives additional comfort that&#13;
this risk would be manageable. Potential operational funding risks are&#13;
discussed ftirtlher under regulatory risks. We note here that SMG has agreed&#13;
to a financial covenant that would, if implemented, generate sufficient&#13;
revenues through operations to meet anticipated operational funding needs&#13;
and begin to contribute to meeting capital needs. An initial tariff adjustment&#13;
implemented from March 1996, would provide funds adequate to cover at&#13;
least O&amp;M costs in the early years of project operation.&#13;
(b)   Construction Risk: The proposed investment differs little in construction&#13;
demands from SSPI. The project agency demonstrated its ability during&#13;
execution of that project to meet construction challenges for this type of&#13;
work. The only major problem arose Nvith one outfall tunnel that had to be&#13;
abandoned during construction due to methane gas problems. Having faced&#13;
this problem once, the project office has asked for the assistance of an expert&#13;
panel to review all tunneling work to be undertaklen in SSPII. That panel&#13;
would help institute the necessarv safeguards to minimize the risk of similar&#13;
problems in this project.&#13;
(c)    Operational Risk: The proposed project relies on technologies familiar to&#13;
SMSC and within the operational capabilities of the current wastewater&#13;
works management and staff. For this reason, operational risks are not&#13;
deemed significant if adequate budget is provided for project operation.&#13;
Regulatory Risk&#13;
33.   Significant regulatory risks are of two types in this project. The first is in regulation&#13;
of industrial effluents and the second in timely approval of covenanted tariff adjustments.&#13;
The pollution control results anticipated for the Huangpu and other surface waters depend&#13;
not only on sewerage technologies successfully constructed and operated by SMSC. Many&#13;
important pollutants must be controlled at source by the industries generating them. A&#13;
failure to do so could threaten either the sewerage infrastructure or the quality of the&#13;
Huangpu and Changjiang waters, depending on where discharged. The principal means of&#13;
mitigating this risk is a strong regulatory regime. The importance of this work was&#13;
recognized during preparation of SEP, which contains provisions for strengthening the&#13;
Shanghai Environmental Protection Bureau and provides for a phased program to bring all&#13;
major industrial polluters into compliance with discharge standards. The city had made&#13;
good progress in that regard prior to SEP, as detailed in the Staff Appraisal Report for that&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-125 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
34.   Tariff Adjustments: During project preparation, SMG approved a tariff schedule&#13;
for implementation commencing in 1996 that would ensure self-financing of SMSC's&#13;
operations. Nonetheless, any specific tariff increase would need the approval of the SMG at&#13;
the time it is proposed. The financial covenant under SSPI permitted financing operations&#13;
through government budget transfers, rather than tariffs. SMG demonstrated a strong&#13;
preference for that option and, in fact, has met the company's needs to date. However, that&#13;
strategy is deemed riskier than beneficiary financing, due to the possibility that strain on the&#13;
municipal budget would lead to a reduction, if only temporarily, in transfers. Furthermore,&#13;
indirect financing through budget transfers provides no price signals to consumers about the&#13;
true cost of producing wastewater, leading to excessive production of wastewater and&#13;
increased demands for infrastructure investment. A significant tariff increase was therefore&#13;
sought during project preparation, and implemented from  March 1996.  Continued&#13;
adherence to the agreed financing covenant would require careful monitoring.&#13;
Reduction Of Risk To Water Supply&#13;
35.   The Shanghai water supply faces the risk of an accident or willful act that would&#13;
prevent operation of the supply system. This could occur if, for example, a major pollution&#13;
spill took place that reached the intake or if the works itself had to shut down for&#13;
mechanical or other reasons. The Shanghai water supply system contains very little storage&#13;
capacity-approximately two hours of operation-increasing the risk of losses from any&#13;
such event. The completion of the proposed project would substantially lower the risk to&#13;
Shanghai's water supply by intercepting wastewater from the major industrial center in the&#13;
city. With completion of the system, a major spill would enter the interceptor and be&#13;
discharged to the Changjiang, with its much higher assimilative capacity and lack of&#13;
downstream extraction for consumption, instead of the Huangpu.&#13;
Risks To Long-Term Sustainability&#13;
36.   The major risks to long-term sustainability are financial and regulatory, and have&#13;
been discussed above. Additional risks arise from outside of Shanghai itself, and center on&#13;
polluting inputs to the various water bodies that Shanghai cannot control. These additional&#13;
pollutants would not change the marginal impact of Shanghai on the various receiving&#13;
waters, but they could overwhelm any benefit that would otherwise be realized by the&#13;
planned investments. In the case of the network of waterways linked to the Huangpu, this&#13;
risk is not great. Most of their pollutants are of local origin, and their control would be a&#13;
function of the proper operation of the project. However, the Huangpu itself suffers from&#13;
nonpoint source pollutants, particularly agricultural, and the Changjiang is carrying&#13;
substantial nutrient loads from upstream agriculture, as well as industrial pollution&#13;
discharges. Satisfactory abatement of those polluting sources would depend on the actions&#13;
of a large number of political jurisdictions, most of which would suffer no immediate harm&#13;
from continued discharges to these rivers. The growing appreciation within China of the&#13;
importance of water pollution abatement offers the best hope of inducing compliance with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-126 -                      ANNEX 15&#13;
the current industrial regulations. A similar appreciation of the risks from agriculture has&#13;
yet to appear, and must become an element of river basin quality control.&#13;
37.   Even if loads from other sources remain as predicted, minimizing any impact from&#13;
growing Shanghai loads would require the treatment facilities tentatively scheduled to begin&#13;
going on line in 2005. The risk remains that they would not be constructed as planned and&#13;
that the assimilative capacity of the Changjiang would therefore be exceeded sometime&#13;
after 2005. Thlis risk may be slightly increased in the with-project case, for without the&#13;
project such additional flows would end up in local waterways or in the Huangpu. In either&#13;
of the latter two cases, the municipality would suffer immediate damage, while in the&#13;
Changjiang case the immediate damage would be less (confined to the fishing industry) and&#13;
therefore better able to be ignored. A similar risk exists if the impact modeling studies were&#13;
over optilllistic. HIere, however, the planned discharges are so far under the assimilative&#13;
capacity that even with an over optimistic estimate, the flows can be safely absorbed.&#13;
Tariff and Effluent Levels&#13;
38.   The tariff schedule adopted by SMSC is based on average, rather than marginal,&#13;
capital and operating costs. An economically efficient tariff would reflect the marginal&#13;
environmental damage of discharges, which cannot be known from the cost of collecting&#13;
and (if done) treating the discharges. Furthermore, that damage would depend very much&#13;
on the particular conmposition of the effluent stream. As a result, tariff policy has been&#13;
designed around the needs of providing the service to the municipally-determined level,&#13;
rather than as a means of reducing demand. Actual demand for effluent removal and&#13;
treatment would also be a function of the demand for water, which is driven in part by water&#13;
prices. Water prices are expected to increase substantially in real terns over the next&#13;
decade as newAT investments are made in higher quality raw water sources (see the Shanghai&#13;
EnvironmenL Project, Report 12386-CHA). The importance of demand regulation can be&#13;
seen by comparing the estimated real tariff levels (1994 prices) needed to sustain&#13;
wastewater services under the medium and low wastewater output scenarios:&#13;
Growth                        Average tariff in given year (Y/m3)&#13;
scenario         1996         2000         2004          2008         2012&#13;
Medium           0.22          0.28         0.36         0.39          0.44&#13;
Low              0.25          0.33         0.39         0.41          0.46&#13;
Note: T ariffs assume no contribution to capital, no capture of revenue from industries that&#13;
self-supply water. Tariffs above are shown in real terms (1994 prices).&#13;
39.   The low growth tariffs are slightly higher than medium growth in 1996, because the&#13;
same size capital works are assumed in both cases. However, additional works come on&#13;
line much more slowly under the low growth scenario, leading to increasingly large savings&#13;
over time. The lower tariffs also help maintain the affordability of the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-127-                        ANNEX 15&#13;
40.   Differences in average tariffs are not sufficient to generate the differences in&#13;
wastewater output between the medium and low growth scenarios. Indeed, most of the&#13;
difference in the medium and low scenarios stems from differing assumptions about price&#13;
and income elasticity of demand for water and wastewater services. But, as suggested&#13;
above, comparison with Hong Kong does support the lower growth scenario and therefore&#13;
more moderate increases in tariffs and demand for new investment.&#13;
Affordability&#13;
41.   Almost all housing in urban Shanghai is served by 24-hour piped water, with only&#13;
1 percent of the population now relying on standpipes for water supply. Therefore, because&#13;
wastewater tariffs are derived from piped water usage for domestic users, even the poorest&#13;
segments of the community would face the higher domestic tariffs proposed to finance the&#13;
project. Based on an averaged wastewater tariff of Y 0.40 proposed above, the expected&#13;
tariff increase would raise the effective cost of water and wastewater services from the&#13;
current Y 0.51 level to Y 0.91 per m3, and the combined water/wastewater bill for families&#13;
in the poorest 10 percent of the population would increase to about Y 12/month (assuming a&#13;
water consumption of about 13 m3/month/liousehold), or 1.5 percent of their incomes. If&#13;
the poorest 10 percent continue to share in real income growth, as they generally have in&#13;
recent years, these cost of living increases can be easily covered. For the very poorest&#13;
0.5 percent, real incomes have not kept pace with social averages. This group would need&#13;
their social welfare payments augmented to meet these additional costs.&#13;
42.   SMSC's consultants conducted a willingness-to-pay for wastewater services study.&#13;
The study was worded to elicit the broadest measure of willingness-to-pay for a healthier&#13;
water regime, rather than to evaluate response to the current project proposal. As such, the&#13;
findings could be interpreted as an upper bound to willingness-to-pay for the current&#13;
project.  The results were consistent with international experience.  T he average&#13;
willingness-to-pay was Y 1.30 per month. This contrasts unfavorably with the Y 4.20 per&#13;
month that would be required of the average family, if they do not adjust their consumption&#13;
when wastewater costs rise. The difference between the willingness-to-pay and the needed&#13;
tariff can be interpreted as a tax on the user to cover the negative externalities generated bv&#13;
their wastewater discharges.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Second Shanghai Sewerage Project is
            part of the next phase of Shanghai Municipality's
            development program to improve environmental conditions and
            management. The overriding project objective is to provide a
            safe environmental setting for the long-term growth of
            Shanghai, enabling sustained economic and industrial growth.
            Specific objectives of the project are to: 1) enhance
            wastewater and stormwater management through expanding
            wastewater collection, pretreatment and disposal capacity
            and stormwater drainage facilities; 2) reduce urban
            pollution impact, while facilitating pollution control; 3)
            improve wastewater utility financial and operational
            management; and 4) strengthen sector institutions through
            training, feasibility studies, and future investment project
            preparation in the environment area. The project will
            comprise: 1) financial and policy initiatives, planning,
            institutional and management reforms; and 2) an investment
            program of environmentally-oriented capital works and
            institutional measures to support management and operational
            capacity-building of Shanghai Municipal Sewerage Company
            Ltd. The investment program will consist of the following
            components: (a) sewerage and sanitation improvements; (b)
            wastewater treatment and disposal systems; and (c)
            institutional development and training.
