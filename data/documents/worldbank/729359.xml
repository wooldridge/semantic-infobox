            Port concessions in Chile - contract design
            to promote competition and investment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of Chile's port
            reform, is to encourage investments for improved port
            equipment, in the hope that this will lead to more efficient
            service, in part by attracting larger, more modern ships.
            The first four major concessions, under which integrated
            terminals are run exclusively by private companies, started
            operations in January 2000. The integrated approach to port
            services replaces a system of free entry of multiple
            stevedoring companies. This note reviews how the concessions
            were designed: the criteria for the winning bids, the rules
            to prevent concessionaires' abusing their monopoly
            power, the rules to encourage investment, and the provisions
            for redundant workers.
