                    P R O C E E D I N G S&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Good morning.&#13;
&#13;
           I will first call on Mr. Ferrer to comment on&#13;
&#13;
 the present situation in Venezuela.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. FERRER:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           By now, you can see that this catastrophe in&#13;
&#13;
 Venezuela is probably worse than in Honduras.      The figures&#13;
&#13;
 which have been confirmed are 5,000 people dead and 10,000&#13;
&#13;
 missing, but unofficially, they are already talking about&#13;
&#13;
 25,000 people dead--&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Twenty-five thousand?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. FERRER:   That is what has been said.     It has&#13;
&#13;
 not been officially confirmed.      But they are talking about&#13;
&#13;
 25,000, most of them buried alive in mud or swept away to&#13;
&#13;
 the sea by the landslides and the water.&#13;
&#13;
           And as to people who have lost their homes, the&#13;
&#13;
 estimate is by now 150,000 and is probably substantially&#13;
&#13;
 larger.   So it is a very serious catastrophe, and it is&#13;
&#13;
 regrettable that so little was known of it until, I&#13;
&#13;
 believe, Friday, maybe even Saturday, because all that&#13;
&#13;
 happened Wednesday and Thursday.       It is amazing how little&#13;
&#13;
 attention the media paid to what was going on over there.&#13;
                                                                   Page3&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            Maybe--and I am not trying to put the blame on&#13;
&#13;
 anyone--maybe the Venezuelan authorities also tried to&#13;
&#13;
 play down the situation at the beginning, and that may&#13;
&#13;
 also be at the root or the origin of what little amount of&#13;
&#13;
 attention has been devoted to it.&#13;
&#13;
            What can the Bank do for Venezuela?      I suppose I&#13;
&#13;
 shouldn't answer that question.        I have been talking&#13;
&#13;
 already with the Country Director and so on on Friday, and&#13;
&#13;
 they have already gotten in touch with the Venezuelan&#13;
&#13;
 authorities.    The most obvious measure that the Bank may&#13;
&#13;
 take, and I believe it is already on its way, is to&#13;
&#13;
 disburse quickly the loans which have still not been&#13;
&#13;
 disbursed.   I believe there are five of them which could&#13;
&#13;
 be disbursed very quickly, and all of them total about&#13;
&#13;
 $400 million.   This could probably be of some help.&#13;
&#13;
            In this respect, I must admit that there has&#13;
&#13;
 been a change in the attitude of the Venezuelan&#13;
&#13;
 authorities.    Before Friday, they would not admit their&#13;
&#13;
 need for some outside help, but by now, they admit that&#13;
&#13;
 any help that may come from any country or any institution&#13;
&#13;
 is welcome, because certainly the catastrophe is very&#13;
&#13;
 serious.&#13;
                                                                   Page4&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           The Bank has already gotten in touch with them.&#13;
&#13;
 We have here always the same problem when catastrophes&#13;
&#13;
 take place--the Bank puts itself at the disposal of the&#13;
&#13;
 authorities, but the authorities are normally in a&#13;
&#13;
 terrible mess and don't know what to ask the Bank or&#13;
&#13;
 anybody else, for that matter, to do.         So I wonder if we&#13;
&#13;
 could start to think in the future of having some kind of&#13;
&#13;
 menu of possibilities on the Bank side to be able to react&#13;
&#13;
 under those circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
           At this stage, that is all I want to say.        I&#13;
&#13;
 just wanted you to be aware that this is a very serious&#13;
&#13;
 catastrophe.   I also want to tell you that I have already&#13;
&#13;
 been working with the Bank, and the Venezuelan authorities&#13;
&#13;
 are already in touch with the staff.        I simply believe&#13;
&#13;
 that this is another opportunity to reflect on what can be&#13;
&#13;
 done for the future and how can the Bank be more proactive&#13;
&#13;
 or do something more target-oriented in the case of these&#13;
&#13;
 kinds of catastrophes.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           I think the Bank's crisis team has actually&#13;
&#13;
 demonstrated in the past that we are very responsive.          As&#13;
&#13;
 soon as we knew about this, we told the Venezuelan&#13;
                                                                     Page5&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 authorities that we were ready.       I instructed on the&#13;
&#13;
 weekend that we go directly to the President and tell him&#13;
&#13;
 that whatever he wants, we will do.        I don't believe there&#13;
&#13;
 is any holding back, but it is very hard to find someone&#13;
&#13;
 in authority to talk to who is fully informed.       I think&#13;
&#13;
 you'd have to say there has been some crisis in government&#13;
&#13;
 in the way in which they have been able to handle this.&#13;
&#13;
           Within the context of what we can do, I believe&#13;
&#13;
 that we are doing everything we can.        Certainly, I think&#13;
&#13;
 the Board would want to know that we have told them that&#13;
&#13;
 funding is available and that we are ready to be&#13;
&#13;
 responsive as we have been in Honduras and in every other&#13;
&#13;
 case.   And I think it is fair to say that in the other&#13;
&#13;
 natural catastrophes which have occurred, the Bank has&#13;
&#13;
 emerged as being the most responsive and the leading&#13;
&#13;
 factor in terms of both immediacy of response and&#13;
&#13;
 consistency of response.&#13;
&#13;
           It would be my hope, Mr. Ferrer, that we will do&#13;
&#13;
 the same in Venezuela, and if there are any things that&#13;
&#13;
 you think we should be doing that we aren't doing, we&#13;
&#13;
 would be very glad to hear them.       But I do believe that&#13;
&#13;
 our office is doing everything we can, and we are working&#13;
                                                                    Page6&#13;

&#13;
 on it on an hour-to-hour basis.         This is not a casual&#13;
&#13;
 activity.&#13;
&#13;
             If there is anything you think we should be&#13;
&#13;
 doing, I would be very glad to hear from you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. FERRER:   I'm sorry, that was not a criticism&#13;
&#13;
 toward the Bank.    I believe the Bank is acting correctly.&#13;
&#13;
 I was just wondering if, in the future, the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
 have some quick or fast-deployment unit to act with&#13;
&#13;
 emergency or aid relief--&#13;
&#13;
             MR. WOLFENSOHN:    But we do have that.         It is in&#13;
&#13;
 action.   We do have a catastrophe unit which comes into&#13;
&#13;
 play right away.    I'll make doubly sure that it is active.&#13;
&#13;
 We operate on a 24-hour basis at the moment there is a&#13;
&#13;
 crisis, and we have done it many times in the last period,&#13;
&#13;
 provided we have a counterparty to deal with.             But I will&#13;
&#13;
 double check on it and make sure we inform the Board&#13;
&#13;
 tomorrow and on Thursday of exactly what is happening.&#13;
&#13;
             It is a terrible thing, and the number of 25,000&#13;
&#13;
 really shocks me.    I am very, very upset to hear that.&#13;
&#13;
 That would be more than the catastrophe in Honduras and&#13;
&#13;
 Guatemala.    It would be terrible.&#13;
&#13;
             The second item I want to report on is that I&#13;
&#13;
 did attend the G-20 meetings last week.              I think most of&#13;
                                                                        Page7&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 you have had reports on these meetings, but they were&#13;
&#13;
 important, I think, as much for the fact that they took&#13;
&#13;
 place as for the substance.     I would have to say that&#13;
&#13;
 substantially, I don't believe any great new ground was&#13;
&#13;
 traversed, but there was at least a coming together of a&#13;
&#13;
 new group known as the G-20 which covered 85 percent of&#13;
&#13;
 the world's population and which was perceived to have&#13;
&#13;
 greater political legitimacy from a global point of view&#13;
&#13;
 in that the G-7/G-8 was effectively added to by other&#13;
&#13;
 major countries, still with some gaps in representation at&#13;
&#13;
 the meeting, but in the opinion of those who put it&#13;
&#13;
 together, as good a group as they could get.        Several&#13;
&#13;
 important areas were not represented, but within the&#13;
&#13;
 European context I think were perceived to be adequately&#13;
&#13;
 covered.&#13;
&#13;
            The substance of the meeting was around&#13;
&#13;
 international financial architecture again, about the&#13;
&#13;
 development process and issues which are facing the global&#13;
&#13;
 community.   A press release was issued, a copy of which if&#13;
&#13;
 you don't have it, I'll be very glad to make sure comes to&#13;
&#13;
 each of you.   It traverses basically just what I have&#13;
&#13;
 said, adding that the WTO is extraordinarily important to&#13;
&#13;
 the architectural and development process.         They welcomed&#13;
                                                                    Page8&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the work done by the Bretton Woods institutions.        They&#13;
&#13;
 asked us to examine ways to reduce vulnerabilities to&#13;
&#13;
 crises in the future, much as we have addressed in the&#13;
&#13;
 past, and they recognized that sound national economic and&#13;
&#13;
 financial policies are central to the building of an&#13;
&#13;
 international financial system--again, something which I&#13;
&#13;
 believe has been commented on before.         Each nation was&#13;
&#13;
 admonished to strengthen its management and its sovereign&#13;
&#13;
 debt management particularly, and there was some&#13;
&#13;
 discussion that unsustainable exchange rate regimes bring&#13;
&#13;
 with them the prospect of vulnerability and crash.&#13;
&#13;
           So there was a broad general debate, as I said,&#13;
&#13;
 in which I don't believe any brand new areas were&#13;
&#13;
 traversed, but the fact was that this was a meeting that&#13;
&#13;
 was important because of the participants.         I believe that&#13;
&#13;
 little more than that happened, but if anybody has any&#13;
&#13;
 questions, I would be glad to observe on them.&#13;
&#13;
           There was some commentary elliptically on the&#13;
&#13;
 Larry Summers statement which had come out the day before,&#13;
&#13;
 but there was no central debate, and there was some&#13;
&#13;
 discussion in the corridors as to who would be the new&#13;
&#13;
 head of the International Monetary Fund, but I was unable&#13;
                                                                     Page9&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 to discern anything that I thought I could report to you&#13;
&#13;
 on the results of those observations.&#13;
&#13;
            So it was an important meeting that we&#13;
&#13;
 participated in that substantially was more a beginning&#13;
&#13;
 than an end of the discussions.&#13;
&#13;
            If anybody has any other perceptions of the&#13;
&#13;
 meeting, I'd be glad if they could perhaps throw them on&#13;
&#13;
 the table.   It was a useful meeting; Mr. Martin was very&#13;
&#13;
 happy to chair the meeting.&#13;
&#13;
            Well, that brings you up-to-date.       Let me now&#13;
&#13;
 pass on to this Board meeting in which I have&#13;
&#13;
 uncharacteristically been programmed by my colleagues to&#13;
&#13;
 read a short opening statement so that I don't get beyond&#13;
&#13;
 the context of the meetings that have already been held&#13;
&#13;
 and so that I don't create problems.        So let me just read&#13;
&#13;
 this, which is approved by my colleagues, and if I&#13;
&#13;
 disagree later, I'll come in and say so, but they have&#13;
&#13;
 asked me to read this.&#13;
&#13;
            It says:   "Our meeting today is to discuss the&#13;
&#13;
 joint Bank/Fund paper on "Poverty Reduction Strategy&#13;
&#13;
 Papers."   This reflects a major commitment on the part of&#13;
&#13;
 our two institutions to work closely together to focus on&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction in low-income countries.&#13;
                                                                   Page10&#13;

&#13;
             I have followed progress over the past few weeks&#13;
&#13;
 and days closely, and I have been particularly heartened&#13;
&#13;
 by the large degree of support indicated for the general&#13;
&#13;
 thrust of our analysis and the valuable views you have&#13;
&#13;
 provided.&#13;
&#13;
             The directions we are proposing involve&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment of our client countries, major changes in our&#13;
&#13;
 operational direction and thereby in our own roles in the&#13;
&#13;
 development community, and last but not least in&#13;
&#13;
 analytical content.&#13;
&#13;
             The road we propose to take will not be smooth&#13;
&#13;
 but will be bumpy, with many twists and turns, but the&#13;
&#13;
 rationale for moving in this direction has become&#13;
&#13;
 increasingly clear to Michel and myself.            We have become&#13;
&#13;
 increasingly worried that despite the remarkable progress&#13;
&#13;
 we have seen in developing outcomes over the past 25&#13;
&#13;
 years, poverty and social inequities remain deeply&#13;
&#13;
 entrenched.    Moreover, we are facing a population increase&#13;
&#13;
 of 2 billion over the next 25 years from the current 6&#13;
&#13;
 billion, most of which will be in the developing and&#13;
&#13;
 transition economies.     It is therefore no longer an option&#13;
&#13;
 but an imperative that we scale up the effectiveness of&#13;
&#13;
 our efforts, qualitatively and quantitatively.           Unless we&#13;
                                                                      Page11&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 make this commitment together, we will surely lose more&#13;
&#13;
 ground against achieving the international development&#13;
&#13;
 goals to reduce poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           As we prepare to move in this direction, I&#13;
&#13;
 cannot help but be impressed by the convergence of views&#13;
&#13;
 across the development community on what should be the key&#13;
&#13;
 principles that should guide us as a compass.        Familiar as&#13;
&#13;
 you are with these, let me list them here:         country&#13;
&#13;
 ownership; a comprehensive approach to development; a&#13;
&#13;
 clear focus on development outcomes and working in&#13;
&#13;
 partnership.&#13;
&#13;
           In particular, you will recall that at the&#13;
&#13;
 September Annual Meetings, Ministers recommended that&#13;
&#13;
 these same principles embedded in the CDF be applied in&#13;
&#13;
 the preparation of PRSPs.     I am very appreciative of this&#13;
&#13;
 clear direction given by the Ministers and support for&#13;
&#13;
 these principles received from our bilateral partners,&#13;
&#13;
 NGOs, and colleagues from other multilateral institutions.&#13;
&#13;
 These shared and generic principles reflect our clear&#13;
&#13;
 understanding that unless the country itself takes&#13;
&#13;
 responsibility for its own long-term development, no&#13;
&#13;
 amount of outside assistance will be effective.        This&#13;
&#13;
 means that governments will have to define their&#13;
                                                                    Page12&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 priorities, make the hard choices, ensure that they&#13;
&#13;
 generate wide support from representative voices of their&#13;
&#13;
 societies.   The Bretton Woods institutions, as the&#13;
&#13;
 countries' key development partners, should be ready to&#13;
&#13;
 offer all effective assistance in this process.&#13;
&#13;
           But given the enormity of the poverty challenge&#13;
&#13;
 facing us, I am also convinced that the Bank and the Fund&#13;
&#13;
 working closely together will be necessary but not&#13;
&#13;
 sufficient for the job that needs to be done.      We have to&#13;
&#13;
 rationalize and scale up the records of all the countries'&#13;
&#13;
 development partners to make a real difference.&#13;
&#13;
           We have tried to give operational expression to&#13;
&#13;
 these principles in the approach to poverty reduction that&#13;
&#13;
 we have outlined in the papers.       This will require that we&#13;
&#13;
 work differently but more effectively with development&#13;
&#13;
 partners and learn from each other as we follow the lead&#13;
&#13;
 of the countries' poverty strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, let me also observe that our focus on&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction also draws on a deep and analytical&#13;
&#13;
 understanding that we can no longer afford to view the&#13;
&#13;
 process of growth and poverty reduction in non-directional&#13;
&#13;
 terms.   As the recent Fund/Board paper on the Poverty&#13;
&#13;
 Reduction and Growth Facility notes, "The new approach&#13;
                                                                   Page13&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 recognizes that not only is growth essential for poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction, but entrenched poverty and severe inequality in&#13;
&#13;
 economic opportunities and asset endowments can themselves&#13;
&#13;
 be impediments to growth.&#13;
&#13;
           The interlinkages between these processes are&#13;
&#13;
 explicitly recognized in the approach that we are&#13;
&#13;
 proposing in these papers, and I look forward to a very&#13;
&#13;
 stimulating discussion.&#13;
&#13;
           I also want to thank Ms. Piercy, Messrs.&#13;
&#13;
 Abraham, Niemi, Pickford, Stek and Wan Abdullah for their&#13;
&#13;
 statements which were circulated in advance.       Mr. Abraham&#13;
&#13;
 has revised his statement, and copies are being made.&#13;
&#13;
           Before proceeding to the discussion of the&#13;
&#13;
 Operational Issues paper, I'd like to take a moment to&#13;
&#13;
 review where we are in terms of the discussion of the&#13;
&#13;
 other papers related to PRSPs.      In addition to the&#13;
&#13;
 Operational Issues paper, we also discussed the "Update on&#13;
&#13;
 Costing the Enhanced HIP Initiative" at the Informal&#13;
&#13;
 Meeting of the Joint Boards of the IMF and Bank on&#13;
&#13;
 December 15th.   As the Update is an information, no&#13;
&#13;
 further discussion is needed.&#13;
&#13;
           On Thursday, December 16th, we met in an&#13;
&#13;
 Informal Meeting to discuss the "International Guidance&#13;
                                                                  Page14&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Note for PRSPs."   After Thursday's full discussion, no&#13;
&#13;
 further discussion is needed.&#13;
&#13;
           Also on December 16th, we discussed "HIPC - Note&#13;
&#13;
 on Modalities for Implementing HIPC Debt Relief under the&#13;
&#13;
 Enhanced Framework."    This Informal Meeting was resumed on&#13;
&#13;
 Friday, December 17, and we will meet formally to discuss&#13;
&#13;
 this paper sometime in January.&#13;
&#13;
           With this review, I think we can proceed to the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion of Operational Issues.        Ann Duncan, who is the&#13;
&#13;
 Adviser on Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers in the PREM&#13;
&#13;
 Network, will begin.    We also have with us Masood Ahmed;&#13;
&#13;
 Sarwar Lateef, who is a Senior Adviser; Mike Walton from&#13;
&#13;
 PREM; John Page, Peter Fallon, Joanne Salop, Ms. Montoliu-&#13;
&#13;
 Munoz, Axel van Trotsenburg and Sudhir Shetty.       So we have&#13;
&#13;
 enough people to answer all of your questions.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me ask Ann to start, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. DUNCAN:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           Management and staff would like to thank you for&#13;
&#13;
 the very constructive and supportive comments you have&#13;
&#13;
 made during our discussions on Poverty Reduction Strategy&#13;
&#13;
 Papers of the last few days.       We are very encouraged by&#13;
&#13;
 the level of your support for an approach which has the&#13;
&#13;
 potential to substantially improve the way the Bank and&#13;
                                                                   Page15&#13;

&#13;
 Fund intend to support reducing poverty in the developing&#13;
&#13;
 world.&#13;
&#13;
            In addition to the comments you have made in the&#13;
&#13;
 Board meetings and the bilateral meetings we have held&#13;
&#13;
 with Executive Directors, we have also received written&#13;
&#13;
 comments, as Mr. Wolfensohn noted, from Messrs. Abraham,&#13;
&#13;
 Pickford, Stek, Niemi, Abdullah, and Ms. Piercy, for which&#13;
&#13;
 we thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            Most of the issues you have raised relate to&#13;
&#13;
 inherent tensions which are due to the competing&#13;
&#13;
 objectives set for the PRSP approach.           What we need,&#13;
&#13;
 therefore, is to find the right balance between these&#13;
&#13;
 objectives, both in design and more importantly in the&#13;
&#13;
 early implementation cases.       We seek your guidance on the&#13;
&#13;
 right balance or approach on the following issues that&#13;
&#13;
 have been raised.&#13;
&#13;
            First is the relationship between growth and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction.     A number of Executive Directors&#13;
&#13;
 stressed the importance of ensuring that growth is pro-&#13;
&#13;
 poor.    While sustained poverty reduction will not be&#13;
&#13;
 possible without economic growth, the benefits of growth&#13;
&#13;
 have to be felt by the poor.&#13;
                                                                  Page16&#13;

                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           As the recent Fund/Board paper on the PRGF&#13;
&#13;
 notes, not only is growth essential for poverty reduction,&#13;
&#13;
 but entrenched poverty and severe inequality in economic&#13;
&#13;
 opportunities and asset endowments can themselves be&#13;
&#13;
 impediments to growth.&#13;
&#13;
           Assuring pro-poor growth will involve dealing&#13;
&#13;
 with the inequalities in assets that influence the extent&#13;
&#13;
 to which the poor participate in the growth process--for&#13;
&#13;
 example, inequalities in education, in land ownership, in&#13;
&#13;
 access to infrastructure that are in turn often related to&#13;
&#13;
 weak influence or lack of voice of the poor.&#13;
&#13;
           Although much of our analytical work has&#13;
&#13;
 recognized these relationships, we plan to be more&#13;
&#13;
 systematic in helping countries take account of these&#13;
&#13;
 interactions as they design the strategies, learning from&#13;
&#13;
 experience and incorporating the findings of the WDR&#13;
&#13;
 2000/2001.&#13;
&#13;
           Second is endorsement of the PRSP by the two&#13;
&#13;
 Boards.   A number of chairs have asked for more clarity on&#13;
&#13;
 exactly what this means.    The PRSP is a government&#13;
&#13;
 document which is considered by the two Boards because it&#13;
&#13;
 sets the context for the concessional assistance programs&#13;
&#13;
 of the Bank and the Fund.     Given the integrated nature of&#13;
                                                                Page17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the country's poverty reduction strategy, the two Boards&#13;
&#13;
 would likely want to review the overall approach set out&#13;
&#13;
 in the PRSP, and they would be informed by the joint staff&#13;
&#13;
 assessment which would accompany the PRSP when it is&#13;
&#13;
 circulated to the Boards.&#13;
&#13;
            However, as the joint paper notes in paragraph&#13;
&#13;
 3, each Board would be asked to "endorse the PRSP insofar&#13;
&#13;
 as it relates to policies and programs supported by each&#13;
&#13;
 institution in its area of responsibility."        It is&#13;
&#13;
 important to emphasize that the word "endorsement" is not&#13;
&#13;
 intended in the legal sense of "approval" but rather to&#13;
&#13;
 provide guidance to Management and to provide an&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity for Board views to be taken fully into&#13;
&#13;
 account.&#13;
&#13;
            Next is the issue of speed of delivery of HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 debt relief or PRGF funding versus country ownership of a&#13;
&#13;
 participatory and effective PRSP.       As Directors have&#13;
&#13;
 noted, there is a tension between preparing participatory&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP documents which are country-owned and well-designed&#13;
&#13;
 versus avoiding delays for HIPC debt relief and PRGF&#13;
&#13;
 funding.&#13;
&#13;
            It is for this reason that staff have proposed a&#13;
&#13;
 transition period which will allow a country to reach its&#13;
                                                               Page18&#13;

                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 decision point provided that it can demonstrate a&#13;
&#13;
 commitment to poverty reduction.       This can be done through&#13;
&#13;
 an "interim" PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
           For the retroactive cases, there is a broad&#13;
&#13;
 sense that we should move forward expeditiously.      At last&#13;
&#13;
 week's Informal Meeting, staff suggested moving forward on&#13;
&#13;
 the basis of Option 2 described in paragraph 55, namely,&#13;
&#13;
 that a country could reach its completion point as early&#13;
&#13;
 as the adoption of a participatory PRSP, depending, of&#13;
&#13;
 course, on progress in policies and poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategies.&#13;
&#13;
           Key poverty outcomes prior to the completion&#13;
&#13;
 point could be specified in the interim PRSP against which&#13;
&#13;
 progress could be judged, and interim assistance could&#13;
&#13;
 again be provided.&#13;
&#13;
           A number of Executive Directors have called for&#13;
&#13;
 even faster delivery of enhanced debt relief, moving&#13;
&#13;
 toward Option 3 in the paper.      We would welcome further&#13;
&#13;
 guidance on this issue.&#13;
&#13;
           On our current plans, we hope to bring three&#13;
&#13;
 countries to their decision point in January--Bolivia,&#13;
&#13;
 Mauritania, and Uganda--with Mozambique brought to its&#13;
&#13;
 decision point shortly thereafter. We would also hope to&#13;
                                                                   Page19&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 bring perhaps another four countries, depending on&#13;
&#13;
 progress in policies and implementation, to their decision&#13;
&#13;
 points in the subsequent quarter.&#13;
&#13;
           Next is the question of how can the adequacy of&#13;
&#13;
 the participatory process be judged.        Some Executive&#13;
&#13;
 Directors want the staff to make an explicit assessment,&#13;
&#13;
 while others judge this to be an essentially political&#13;
&#13;
 process that staff should not undertake.           Based on these&#13;
&#13;
 comments, we will explore whether the staff assessment&#13;
&#13;
 could go somewhat further by giving a somewhat more&#13;
&#13;
 structured description of the participatory process of the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP to inform the Board's judgment, drawing on advice on&#13;
&#13;
 good practice we are developing for the toolkit on&#13;
&#13;
 participatory processes.&#13;
&#13;
           However, I would stress that this is an area in&#13;
&#13;
 which early experience will be of great value in helping&#13;
&#13;
 to define precisely how far the staff assessment can&#13;
&#13;
 feasibly and usefully go.&#13;
&#13;
           Next is the issue of country ownership of the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP versus weak capacity in many poor countries.&#13;
&#13;
 Directors emphasized the demands that the introduction of&#13;
&#13;
 PRSPs impose on the already strained institutional&#13;
&#13;
 capacity of poor countries.     This has two implications.&#13;
                                                                     Page20&#13;

&#13;
 First, it is crucial that a poverty reduction strategy be&#13;
&#13;
 embedded in the country's delivery systems.        In&#13;
&#13;
 particular, it should be incorporated into the&#13;
&#13;
 government's budget system.     Second, the Bank is aware of&#13;
&#13;
 the needs for capacity-building that this program would&#13;
&#13;
 generate; by proposing a gradual approach, starting with&#13;
&#13;
 interim PRSPs, and by offering to provide as much support&#13;
&#13;
 as needed and encourage the support from others, the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 expects that the potential pressure on countries would be&#13;
&#13;
 eased.&#13;
&#13;
           The role of Bank and Fund staff, as well as of&#13;
&#13;
 other donors, should be of a supportive nature.         As the&#13;
&#13;
 paper states, this implies a culture shift for Bank and&#13;
&#13;
 Fund staff, and it also implies a change in the way staff&#13;
&#13;
 would be evaluated.&#13;
&#13;
           Next is the issue of the role of other donors.&#13;
&#13;
 A number of Executive Directors welcomed the PRSP as a&#13;
&#13;
 potential instrument on which other donors could also base&#13;
&#13;
 their programs of assistance and which would facilitate&#13;
&#13;
 donor coordination.   We will encourage other partners and&#13;
&#13;
 aid agencies to participate and even take the lead where&#13;
&#13;
 they are better placed to do so.&#13;
                                                                  Page21&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Recipient countries should be free to choose on&#13;
&#13;
 whom to draw for assistance to produce the PRSP--for&#13;
&#13;
 example, the UNDP, bilateral agencies, regional&#13;
&#13;
 development banks, the EU.     As an example, this is a&#13;
&#13;
 central part of the agenda of the Working Group on Poverty&#13;
&#13;
 of the International Financial Institutes.         The Bank and&#13;
&#13;
 Fund met with the RDBs a week ago to discuss how to&#13;
&#13;
 cooperate on PRSP-related work.&#13;
&#13;
           Next is the issue of the costs of PRSPs.        It is&#13;
&#13;
 clear that the preparation of PRSPs is costly for the&#13;
&#13;
 countries concerned as well as for the Bank and Fund and&#13;
&#13;
 other donors supporting the process.        The countries will&#13;
&#13;
 need to collect data, set up consultation processes, and&#13;
&#13;
 build capacity wherever these are not adequate.        It is&#13;
&#13;
 therefore imperative to bring other partners into the&#13;
&#13;
 process early so they can assist the countries to meet&#13;
&#13;
 these additional costs.&#13;
&#13;
           Regarding the costs for the Bank, Management&#13;
&#13;
 plans to focus on redeployment this fiscal year, including&#13;
&#13;
 aligning ESW more closely with the PRSP work.        As noted in&#13;
&#13;
 the informal meeting, we will be monitoring the costs of&#13;
&#13;
 the initiative in the coming months and will report back&#13;
                                                                    Page22&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 if we need to revisit the initial expectations about&#13;
&#13;
 redeployment.&#13;
&#13;
             For FY01 and beyond, we will return to this&#13;
&#13;
 subject as part of the Strategic Directions discussions in&#13;
&#13;
 the coming months.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally is the issue of IMF/Bank cooperation&#13;
&#13;
 versus undermining country ownership and the perception of&#13;
&#13;
 "ganging up" on countries.      We cannot have inconsistent&#13;
&#13;
 views between the Bank and the Fund, yet at the same time,&#13;
&#13;
 a firm, common initial position could undercut the&#13;
&#13;
 domestic process in developing a country-owned strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             We propose to manage this by getting a common&#13;
&#13;
 perspective that lays out the principles and issues as&#13;
&#13;
 seen by the Bank and the Fund, without laying out a&#13;
&#13;
 specific position.&#13;
&#13;
             You have also raised a number of other points of&#13;
&#13;
 guidance which we will take into account in the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation process and in any future revisions to&#13;

           Let me also welcome Tony Boote, an Assistant&#13;
&#13;
 Directors; Russell Kincaid, Assistant Director of the&#13;
&#13;
 Policy Development and Review Department; and David&#13;
&#13;
 Andrews, Senior Economist, who are joining us from the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund.   We are very   happy to see you here.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me now start the list.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Hubloue, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. HUBLOUE:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I am happy that on the basis of the excellent&#13;
&#13;
 staff preparations, and after last week's informal&#13;
&#13;
 discussions, we are today in a position to give our formal&#13;
&#13;
 support to the launch of the PRSP process.&#13;
&#13;
           While the discussions of last week indicated&#13;
&#13;
 that the link between the PRSP and many of our existing&#13;
&#13;
 processes and instruments--CDF, CAS, and so on--will have&#13;
&#13;
 to be clarified as we learn from experience, I believe&#13;
&#13;
 these discussions have also highlighted that we may here&#13;
&#13;
 before us have the so-called missing link between the CDF&#13;
&#13;
 process based on principles now widely endorsed by the&#13;
&#13;
 international development community and, on the other&#13;
&#13;
 hand, the operational programs which should translate&#13;
&#13;
 these principles into effective and sustained poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction.&#13;
                                                              Page24&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             From that perspective, I think we should expect&#13;
&#13;
 that there should be serious commitment and even a good&#13;
&#13;
 deal of enthusiasm to make this challenging approach work.&#13;
&#13;
 Our task will be to mobilize that positive energy and to&#13;
&#13;
 sustain it over a sufficiently long period of time.       I&#13;
&#13;
 think that that is important because, as you said in the&#13;
&#13;
 introductory remarks which were prepared for you, it is&#13;
&#13;
 going to be a bumpy road, but I would almost say that I&#13;
&#13;
 hope it will be a bumpy road, because the main risk for me&#13;
&#13;
 would be that the process would soon elapse into a kind of&#13;
&#13;
 bureaucratic process in which it will be impossible to&#13;
&#13;
 meet the expectations that we all have for this new&#13;
&#13;
 approach.&#13;
&#13;
             In that connection, let me make three brief&#13;
&#13;
 comments on the following issues--first, on transitional&#13;
&#13;
 arrangements; second, on resource implications; and third,&#13;
&#13;
 on the role of the Board.&#13;
&#13;
             On transitional arrangements, it is clear to me&#13;
&#13;
 that an early start soon to be followed by visible results&#13;
&#13;
 will be a critical factor in establishing the initial&#13;
&#13;
 credibility of the whole process.        I agree with everything&#13;
&#13;
 that Pieter Stek has said in that connection in his&#13;
&#13;
 written statement under the heading "Substance of&#13;
                                                                    Page25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Process."    Indeed, I believe that countries with a good&#13;
&#13;
 track record on the implementation of a comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction strategy should not be requested to&#13;
&#13;
 start everything all over again according to the book.      A&#13;
&#13;
 credible commitment to further deepening of their strategy&#13;
&#13;
 based on satisfactory past performance should for these&#13;
&#13;
 countries be a sufficient condition to unlock the&#13;
&#13;
 international support that goes with a strong PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
             More specifically, it should not be ruled out&#13;
&#13;
 that a number of the retroactive HIPC cases meet these&#13;
&#13;
 conditions.    Subject to the availability of sufficient&#13;
&#13;
 funding resources, these cases should have access to&#13;
&#13;
 retroactive HIPC financing upon production of their&#13;
&#13;
 interim PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
             All in all, we can therefore support Option 3 in&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph 56 of the document and propose that for as many&#13;
&#13;
 countries as possible, we try to proceed by following the&#13;
&#13;
 proposals laid out in that option.&#13;
&#13;
             Second, on resource implications, there, I&#13;
&#13;
 believe we will from the outside commit ourselves to&#13;
&#13;
 keeping this aspect of the whole process under review,&#13;
&#13;
 with an open mind.    Frankly, I cannot imagine that during&#13;
&#13;
 the start-up phase of the initiative, especially the&#13;
                                                                 Page26&#13;

                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Africa Region and most of the African countries, would not&#13;
&#13;
 face significant resource and capacity constraints.&#13;
&#13;
 Without proper and constructive monitoring of this&#13;
&#13;
 situation, these constraints may either affect the quality&#13;
&#13;
 of the PRSP process, especially the ownership of it, or&#13;
&#13;
 they may erode the pipeline of future lending operations&#13;
&#13;
 which should follow the presentation of a valid PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
           Specifically, I would propose that soon after&#13;
&#13;
 next month's consultations with the African governments on&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSP process, we have an informal follow-up meeting on&#13;
&#13;
 this critical aspect with the Africa Region, so that from&#13;
&#13;
 the outset, we can learn and have a fairly good perception&#13;
&#13;
 of what we are up to.&#13;
&#13;
           Donor resources to support the process,&#13;
&#13;
 especially the in-country process, will have to be&#13;
&#13;
 mobilized to the maximum extent.       I believe Pieter Stek&#13;
&#13;
 has also made a number of valid comments there.&#13;
&#13;
           I also would perhaps propose, or would not rule&#13;
&#13;
 out, that at some point, it may be useful that especially&#13;
&#13;
 for the limitations that the countries themselves are&#13;
&#13;
 going to meet, a sufficient share of resources which are&#13;
&#13;
 being allocated under the PACT Initiative may have to be&#13;
&#13;
 reallocated or devoted especially to help the countries&#13;
                                                                Page27&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 build up the necessary capacity to participate in that&#13;
&#13;
 process.   Indeed, I believe there are potentially&#13;
&#13;
 important synergies between, let's say, the countries'&#13;
&#13;
 participation in the PRSP process and the whole spirit of&#13;
&#13;
 the PACT Initiative which was approved a couple of months&#13;
&#13;
 ago.&#13;
&#13;
            Third, on the implications of the PRSP process&#13;
&#13;
 for the Board, these implications may seem of little&#13;
&#13;
 significance compared to the efforts that are going to be&#13;
&#13;
 expected from all other players in the game, I believe we&#13;
&#13;
 should also as a Board from the beginning learn from&#13;
&#13;
 experimentation and be fully aware of how we are expected&#13;
&#13;
 to participate in the whole process.&#13;
&#13;
            I believe indeed that the quality of the&#13;
&#13;
 dialogue in the Board which should take place at the&#13;
&#13;
 occasion of the Board presentation of the PRSP process&#13;
&#13;
 will over time become a significant element in sustaining&#13;
&#13;
 the momentum of the whole process, because it is at that&#13;
&#13;
 level that institutional signals are being given about&#13;
&#13;
 what we expect and how this whole process should fit into&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank's program.&#13;
&#13;
            On this point, I believe it is fair to&#13;
&#13;
 acknowledge that this Board has no culture of formulating&#13;
                                                             Page28&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 strong collective views on the validity of countries'&#13;
&#13;
 development programs, especially if they are not directly&#13;
&#13;
 related to the scenarios and triggers for Bank lending&#13;
&#13;
 programs.    We can, I believe, in this respect not ignore&#13;
&#13;
 the experience from the PFP process on which in 1995, it&#13;
&#13;
 was decided that the Board should no longer discuss these&#13;
&#13;
 papers, probably because the Board had already lost&#13;
&#13;
 interest in doing so for a number of years.&#13;
&#13;
             The challenge to do different at this time is&#13;
&#13;
 even bigger, because the substance to be covered is so&#13;
&#13;
 much more complex.    We have to learn to listen carefully&#13;
&#13;
 to what countries have to tell us in their PRSPs before&#13;
&#13;
 speaking up on their validity, and our discussions will&#13;
&#13;
 need to be focused in order to be productive.&#13;
&#13;
             I would not rule out that soon after we have&#13;
&#13;
 discussed the first series of PRSPs in the Board that it&#13;
&#13;
 would be useful to take stock also at the level of the&#13;
&#13;
 Board and develop progressively in consultation with&#13;
&#13;
 Management a reference list of those topics on which it is&#13;
&#13;
 felt that we as a Board can make the most productive&#13;
&#13;
 collective contribution to the whole process.&#13;
&#13;
             Let me end with two more specific comments on&#13;
&#13;
 the final stages of the PRSP process.          First, I note from&#13;
                                                                     Page29&#13;

                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph 34 of the document that in general, PRSPs will&#13;
&#13;
 be finalized for presentation to the Board only after they&#13;
&#13;
 have been refined or modified to the point at which&#13;
&#13;
 Management feels comfortable to recommend them for&#13;
&#13;
 endorsement.    This is the way we usually proceed.   I can&#13;
&#13;
 live with that approach, but I believe that it will also&#13;
&#13;
 be consistent with the whole spirit of the exercise,&#13;
&#13;
 especially with our desire to maintain ownership of the&#13;
&#13;
 country all along the process and that these discussions&#13;
&#13;
 on final negotiations on how the PRSP will be prepared at&#13;
&#13;
 these discussions will be reflected in the documents&#13;
&#13;
 presented to the Board.&#13;
&#13;
             Second--and there, it has become clear that we&#13;
&#13;
 still have some issues to be discussed from the&#13;
&#13;
 introductory remarks--I am indeed not convinced that we&#13;
&#13;
 should adopt the proposal to have the Board make judgments&#13;
&#13;
 on the quality of the participatory process without&#13;
&#13;
 benefitting from the staff's assessment of this aspect of&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSP.    If the quality of the participation is&#13;
&#13;
 considered to be among the key factors of a sustained and&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive poverty reduction, I believe the Board's&#13;
&#13;
 views on it will certainly benefit from a balanced,&#13;
&#13;
 country-based Management perspective.&#13;

           If Management feels that it is not in a position&#13;
&#13;
 to give that perspective because the issue is in its view&#13;
&#13;
 too political, I think we should refrain from involving&#13;
&#13;
 the Board in it, because then it is certainly going to be&#13;
&#13;
 political.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:      Thank you for those thoughtful&#13;
&#13;
 comments, Mr. Hubloue.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Holden?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. HOLDEN:     I am on the whole very supportive&#13;
&#13;
 of the proposed approach even if quite nervous about&#13;
&#13;
 whether we will be able to meet the enormous challenge of&#13;
&#13;
 achieving what is a very multifaceted objective for a&#13;
&#13;
 strategy that is at the same time useful, focused and&#13;
&#13;
 genuinely country-owned.&#13;
&#13;
           I want to reiterate the comments that are&#13;
&#13;
 already in the written statements and Luc's comments and&#13;
&#13;
 discussion last week, that we do need to be flexible and&#13;
&#13;
 accommodating as we move forward and must in that context&#13;
&#13;
 very much accept the "learning-by-doing," iterative nature&#13;
&#13;
 of this exercise.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we have also got to accept the reality&#13;
&#13;
 of highly subjective judgments in terms of both the&#13;
                                                                 Page31&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 process, including the participatory process by which&#13;
&#13;
 PRSPs are formulated, and the content of them.       There is a&#13;
&#13;
 real discipline, I think, for all of us here to avoid&#13;
&#13;
 being too quick to substitute our values for those of our&#13;
&#13;
 member countries.&#13;
&#13;
             I want very much to focus my comments this&#13;
&#13;
 morning on the issue of endorsement and of the nexus&#13;
&#13;
 between the completed or interim PRSP and the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 assistance program, because I think that is the part that&#13;
&#13;
 I am least comfortable with that we have gotten the&#13;
&#13;
 clarity we need.&#13;
&#13;
             As many people have noted, there is a real&#13;
&#13;
 tension between the principle of genuine ownership and the&#13;
&#13;
 notion of multilateral or bilateral endorsement of a&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.    I take the comments about not meaning&#13;
&#13;
 "endorsement" here in the strict legal sense, but the word&#13;
&#13;
 certainly carries a lot of baggage with it, I think.&#13;
&#13;
             To a large extent, of course, the tensions are&#13;
&#13;
 inevitable.    It is both inevitable and, I think,&#13;
&#13;
 ultimately quite desirable that donors will determine the&#13;
&#13;
 nature and quantum of the assistance they are prepared to&#13;
&#13;
 offer on the basis of country actions and intentions.&#13;
                                                                   Page32&#13;

                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            I would also say that armed with our new, richer&#13;
&#13;
 sense of the importance of adopting a comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
 approach to development, it seems to me both impractical&#13;
&#13;
 and undesirable to try and narrow our focus to some notion&#13;
&#13;
 of the Bank's or the Fund's particular concerns.       I agree&#13;
&#13;
 with Jan Piercy's comments on that point.&#13;
&#13;
            But we must also recognize that highly&#13;
&#13;
 prescriptive approaches to conditionality and so on, with&#13;
&#13;
 the implications of genuine ownership, have largely been&#13;
&#13;
 ignored in practice and have not been successful.       On the&#13;
&#13;
 one hand, countries have not taken real responsibility for&#13;
&#13;
 the policies proposed, and equally as important on the&#13;
&#13;
 other, the donor community has been understandably very&#13;
&#13;
 reluctant to deliver on the threat that conditionality&#13;
&#13;
 implies.&#13;
&#13;
            I think the proposed approach to endorsement of&#13;
&#13;
 PRSPs and the assistance that might flow from is&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerable on at least two counts.        First, endorsement&#13;
&#13;
 with its implication of grading country efforts may I&#13;
&#13;
 think undermine our efforts to turn over a new leaf with&#13;
&#13;
 respect to the notion of ownership.&#13;
&#13;
            Second and somewhat paradoxically, the to date&#13;
&#13;
 somewhat fuzzy link between endorsement and our specific&#13;
                                                                  Page33&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 lending and nonlending program could be both too loose and&#13;
&#13;
 too rigid--too loose in that if consideration of a PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 takes place without a very clear sense of the consequences&#13;
&#13;
 in terms of the quality and quantity of assistance, then I&#13;
&#13;
 think both the country and the Bank or the Bank Board may&#13;
&#13;
 be uncertain about the relevance of the PRSP exercise, and&#13;
&#13;
 it may fall into the kind of neglect that previous&#13;
&#13;
 attempts have--put bluntly, both the country and the Board&#13;
&#13;
 may see the real action as in another place and another&#13;
&#13;
 time--and too rigid in that countries may also see&#13;
&#13;
 endorsement of their PRSP as both a necessary and a&#13;
&#13;
 sufficient condition for access to the high-lending case&#13;
&#13;
 nirvana.   I don't think we would see the PRSP in any sense&#13;
&#13;
 as the end of the road.&#13;
&#13;
            Now, in many respects, this is an issue of&#13;
&#13;
 semantics, but I wonder if both of the problems I have&#13;
&#13;
 outlined might be ameliorated to some extent were we to&#13;
&#13;
 desist from endorsing PRSPs as such and instead, rather,&#13;
&#13;
 note them, while at the same time using the joint&#13;
&#13;
 assessment that is proposed to more formally respond to&#13;
&#13;
 the country's PRSP.   In a sense, I think this is what is&#13;
&#13;
 meant anyway, but I think it is a case where terminology&#13;
&#13;
 is going to be quite important.&#13;

           It seems to me that the assessment might indeed&#13;
&#13;
 be seen as a core or significant part of the Bank's CAS&#13;
&#13;
 but would in any event give them a much more concrete&#13;
&#13;
 sense of the Bank's program going forward.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Well, thank you very much, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Holden.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Haque?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. HAQUE:   Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           The Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers in my view&#13;
&#13;
 mark an exceedingly significant landmark in our endeavors&#13;
&#13;
 to translate into operational reality our central mission&#13;
&#13;
 and overarching vision.&#13;
&#13;
           It was said long ago that a tree is not really&#13;
&#13;
 known by its roots, but by its fruits.         What shape our&#13;
&#13;
 aspirations assume in terms of attainment is a real test.&#13;
&#13;
 Promises, Mr. Chairman, remain academic unless transformed&#13;
&#13;
 into performance, and performance is possible only if&#13;
&#13;
 there is a well-thought-out road map.         Preparation of this&#13;
&#13;
 road map in the context of poverty reduction is indeed&#13;
&#13;
 important and significant.     The Bank and Fund staff&#13;
&#13;
 deserve our sincerest thanks and appreciation for this&#13;
&#13;
 collaborative effort, for this productive joint venture.&#13;
                                                                     Page35&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           I should also like to thank the management of&#13;
&#13;
 both these institutions for providing leadership and&#13;
&#13;
 guidance to staff and a refreshing willingness to join&#13;
&#13;
 hands in this crusade against poverty.          Convening the&#13;
&#13;
 joint meetings of the Boards of the Bank and Fund was a&#13;
&#13;
 very welcome manifestation of this new order, this new&#13;
&#13;
 dispensation.&#13;
&#13;
           It should, however, be realized that this is an&#13;
&#13;
 ongoing process.   There can be no finality claimed for it.&#13;
&#13;
 It is a matter, as Pieter Stek says, of continuous debate.&#13;
&#13;
 Moreover, it must be viewed in the overall context of the&#13;
&#13;
 Comprehensive Development Framework.         I have read&#13;
&#13;
 somewhere it has been stated that the strategy papers, or&#13;
&#13;
 the thinking behind them, are consistent with the&#13;
&#13;
 Comprehensive Development Framework.         I don't think this&#13;
&#13;
 is the right way of putting it.        We may say that it is a&#13;
&#13;
 manifestation of the CDF and not mere consistency with it.&#13;
&#13;
           It has been realized and I think it will&#13;
&#13;
 continue to be realized that the PRSP is not a blueprint;&#13;
&#13;
 it is not a detailed prescription but a process or&#13;
&#13;
 compass, and it will be built on existing thinking.&#13;
&#13;
           The principles set out in Box 1 appear to be as&#13;
&#13;
 sound and acceptable, and I don't propose any change at&#13;
                                                                   Page36&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 this moment.   Let us learn by doing and modify whatever we&#13;
&#13;
 want to do in the area of the principles in light of&#13;
&#13;
 experience on the ground and further analytical work.&#13;
&#13;
           I therefore think that reviewing this&#13;
&#13;
 periodically, with the first review in 2001, is a very&#13;
&#13;
 sound idea, although I agree with Stephen Pickford that we&#13;
&#13;
 must recognize the importance of such strategy reflected&#13;
&#13;
 in the country's delivery system.&#13;
&#13;
           I find one of the most important features of the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy is the clear option by both institutions for pro-&#13;
&#13;
 poor growth as against mere growth.        Of course, growth&#13;
&#13;
 must be shared, and benefits must go to the poor.       Of&#13;
&#13;
 course, it need not be emphasized that without sustained&#13;
&#13;
 growth, there can be no reductio of poverty, but as has&#13;
&#13;
 been pointed out, poverty itself is an impediment in the&#13;
&#13;
 path of growth.&#13;
&#13;
           I also find that sound principles like the&#13;
&#13;
 participation of civil society, the interim PRSPs, the&#13;
&#13;
 need for flexibility, and above all, the country-driven&#13;
&#13;
 nature, are welcome and commendable.&#13;
&#13;
           I propose, Mr. Chairman, to briefly touch on two&#13;
&#13;
 or three points in specific.      One is the issue of&#13;
                                                                Page37&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 ownership; second is the role of the two Boards; and the&#13;
&#13;
 third is conditionality.&#13;
&#13;
           Coming to the question of ownership, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, I have been hearing this phrase not only in this&#13;
&#13;
 Board, but I have come across this rubric long ago when I&#13;
&#13;
 was in the field.    But when I contrasted the reality of&#13;
&#13;
 this, I was always disappointed.         Ownership most of the&#13;
&#13;
 time has been an optical illusion.          It has not been real.&#13;
&#13;
 It has not been genuine.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to be reassured that now we are&#13;
&#13;
 going ahead with the transformation of this idea, that&#13;
&#13;
 this will be a genuine ownership.         We should not have&#13;
&#13;
 ownership which is sort of a product of paternal guidance,&#13;
&#13;
 not a manifestation of what I would call Confucian&#13;
&#13;
 syndrome, which syndrome is that we know better, that we&#13;
&#13;
 are wiser than the people.       That has to be given up, and&#13;
&#13;
 it requires great effort, Mr. Chairman; it is not easy.&#13;
&#13;
 This is ingrained.     People who know more or think they&#13;
&#13;
 know more are naturally not going to give up this idea, so&#13;
&#13;
 this requires humility, and it also requires an&#13;
&#13;
 appreciation that there can be more than one way of doing&#13;
&#13;
 things.   And this would require a continuous effort to&#13;
&#13;
 change the culture of poverty.        I do realize, Mr.&#13;
                                                                     Page38&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, that you have a genuine commitment to this, but&#13;
&#13;
 I hope this genuine commitment will percolate down to the&#13;
&#13;
 staff of both institutions when they are dealing with the&#13;
&#13;
 problems.&#13;
&#13;
             On the ownership, again, I find it a little&#13;
&#13;
 problematic.    There is a danger which I expressed the&#13;
&#13;
 other day at the joint meeting, that when two powerful&#13;
&#13;
 institutions like the World Bank and the IMF come&#13;
&#13;
 together, it is like two gladiators coming together,&#13;
&#13;
 trying to teach a small pygmy how to improve body-&#13;
&#13;
 building.    The whole process can be very, very difficult--&#13;
&#13;
 overpowering and overwhelming.       So we will have to ensure-&#13;
&#13;
 -and this can be done by a continuous drilling in the&#13;
&#13;
 minds of people that, look, ownership has to be&#13;
&#13;
 recognized.    Without genuine ownership, I am afraid these&#13;
&#13;
 strategies will never see that sort of fruition and&#13;
&#13;
 completion which we require.&#13;
&#13;
             Then, we come to the role of the two Boards.&#13;
&#13;
 This question was also raised by the senior Deputy&#13;
&#13;
 Managing Director of the Fund, and I find that we must try&#13;
&#13;
 to answer it, but questions have been raised very rightly&#13;
&#13;
 by my colleague, Wan Abdullah, in this when he said:       "In&#13;
&#13;
 terms of Board presentation, we wonder how the&#13;
                                                                   Page39&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 arrangements will work in the event the views of the two&#13;
&#13;
 Boards differ.   Which Board makes the primary decision,&#13;
&#13;
 thereby setting the overriding framework?"&#13;
&#13;
           And similarly, Jan Piercy also very wisely&#13;
&#13;
 raised this point and talked about whether the strategy is&#13;
&#13;
 an integral strategy or if we can take it as a segmented&#13;
&#13;
 thing.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, in this context also is the&#13;
&#13;
 question of endorsement.    I have been very happy and a&#13;
&#13;
 little bit reassured by learning that endorsement is not&#13;
&#13;
 being used in terms of a technical approval, because that,&#13;
&#13;
 I think, would be very unfortunate.        That would be&#13;
&#13;
 striking at the concept of ownership from the very&#13;
&#13;
 beginning.&#13;
&#13;
           So endorsement could be sort of a support, one&#13;
&#13;
 might say, and we may live with this phrase unless a&#13;
&#13;
 better phrase is thought of.&#13;
&#13;
           But what can be done about the endorsement by&#13;
&#13;
 two Boards?   May I come along with an idea which is&#13;
&#13;
 somewhat unorthodox, something which represents a change&#13;
&#13;
 in my own thinking?   My feeling would be that endorsement&#13;
&#13;
 could be done--we call it "endorsement," within inverted&#13;
&#13;
 commas--by a meeting of joint Boards.         The Boards of IMF&#13;
                                                                   Page40&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 and the World Bank, as they met the other day, should come&#13;
&#13;
 together.    We must make the deliberation manageable, and&#13;
&#13;
 it can be done so that there is only one intervention from&#13;
&#13;
 one constituency.    We are represented both in the Fund and&#13;
&#13;
 in the Bank, so both of the Executive Directors need not&#13;
&#13;
 speak; one of them can speak.        That would also bring about&#13;
&#13;
 a unity of thinking of shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
             So I would submit it for consideration that this&#13;
&#13;
 sort of endorsement--and this will become more informal&#13;
&#13;
 also, because if you do it in separate Boards, it will&#13;
&#13;
 become more formal--it will become less formal as well.&#13;
&#13;
 So this is something which I would just present as food&#13;
&#13;
 for thought.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. WOLFENSOHN:    I think that that last&#13;
&#13;
 suggestion is one that the Board should consider and&#13;
&#13;
 deliberate on, on the issues of a joint meeting with your&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues at the Fund.       I think they are done informally,&#13;
&#13;
 and I think it is for you to consider.           On the question of&#13;
&#13;
 ownership, I think we do have a long way to go in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 seeing how it works.     I think ownership is important.       It&#13;
&#13;
 does not mean that any requirements that the Bank or Fund&#13;
&#13;
 might perceive to be necessary to get an appropriate&#13;
                                                                       Page41&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 strategy need to be thrown out the window.         What it means&#13;
&#13;
 is that we should not have in cement what it is we want&#13;
&#13;
 but that there should be a dialogue with the countries and&#13;
&#13;
 that the countries absolutely free, and it is appropriate&#13;
&#13;
 that they should conduct their reviews of the poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy in their own way and with complete&#13;
&#13;
 ownership.   If, however, they were to come up with a--this&#13;
&#13;
 is my personal perception--if they were to come up with&#13;
&#13;
 something that was new and innovative that we hadn't&#13;
&#13;
 thought of, and we want to accept, that would be great.&#13;
&#13;
 On the other hand, if they leave gaping holes in things&#13;
&#13;
 that this Board might want to be included, we would be&#13;
&#13;
 entitled to go back and on an equal basis say to them we&#13;
&#13;
 think that this approach is fascinating, interesting, but&#13;
&#13;
 it doesn't meet the requirements of the Board.        That is&#13;
&#13;
 something that I think is the logic of the negotiation.&#13;
&#13;
 It doesn't mean that the Board has to accept whatever it&#13;
&#13;
 is that the country brings forward.        They may bring&#13;
&#13;
 forward a fantastic and innovative and remarkable&#13;
&#13;
 response; they may bring forward something that is&#13;
&#13;
 lamentable and doesn't meet our needs.         I think that that&#13;
&#13;
 is perfectly appropriate that we should be able to take&#13;
&#13;
 the judgment of the Board.     I think that what is important&#13;
                                                                    Page42&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 is that the country should be in the driver's seat to try&#13;
&#13;
 to conduct their strategy, and it is our intent that we&#13;
&#13;
 should help them do that and be supportive.&#13;
&#13;
           So I think the question of ownership is&#13;
&#13;
 something that we are going to have to feel our way into.&#13;
&#13;
 I think the motion that you put forward of two gladiators&#13;
&#13;
 coming in and crushing a pygmy is certainly not my concept&#13;
&#13;
 of how this is, nor is my concept that we have to throw&#13;
&#13;
 away any ideas that we have about what is important in a&#13;
&#13;
 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it is a question of having equal&#13;
&#13;
 dialogue but being clear that the ownership and control&#13;
&#13;
 and direction of the strategy paper should be in the hands&#13;
&#13;
 of the government concerned.      I think that that is&#13;
&#13;
 something that we will learn about as we move forward.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Kamitomai?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. KAMITOMAI:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           We would like to join other colleagues in&#13;
&#13;
 commending the staff of both institutions for this&#13;
&#13;
 excellent work.   We also welcome a series of informal&#13;
&#13;
 discussions, including the joint Board discussion, to help&#13;
&#13;
 us deepen our understanding.      We are supportive of the&#13;
&#13;
 thrust of the proposal.&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            Since we already had the occasion to discuss the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP, I would like to limit my comments to the following&#13;
&#13;
 five issues.     The first is on the nature of the PRSP and&#13;
&#13;
 the way forward.&#13;
&#13;
            As I have pointed out in a previous statement,&#13;
&#13;
 there still seems to be no clear consensus on the nature&#13;
&#13;
 of the PRSP and what the Board is supposed to endorse&#13;
&#13;
 and/or approve.    While we consider that we can go forward,&#13;
&#13;
 we hope that we can make this issue clearer in our&#13;
&#13;
 exercises.&#13;
&#13;
            In discussing the PRSP at the Board, we think it&#13;
&#13;
 is useful to discuss implications to Bank operations at&#13;
&#13;
 the same time.    Hence, it is desirable to discuss the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP, to     ?    its assessment paper and the CAS that&#13;
&#13;
 stems from the PRSP.     In this vein, we would like to ask&#13;
&#13;
 Management to make efforts in gradually integrating this&#13;
&#13;
 document into the overall process.          In forming the PRSP,&#13;
&#13;
 consultation with the recipient government is&#13;
&#13;
 indispensable, but we hope that the work will proceed&#13;
&#13;
 promptly so that we can provide the expanded HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 Initiative without delay.&#13;
&#13;
            We also hope that non-HIPC countries would also&#13;
&#13;
 demonstrate strong ownership in the PRSP process.&#13;
                                                                    Page44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Second is on judging the adequacy of the&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process.     Participation is at the core of&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSP framework and takes place at its design,&#13;
&#13;
 implementation and monitoring stage.         It is obviously the&#13;
&#13;
 key to the success of the framework.         The Bank has&#13;
&#13;
 substantial experience in participation through conducting&#13;
&#13;
 participatory CG and the CAS, and we hope that the&#13;
&#13;
 Management will provide advice to the recipient government&#13;
&#13;
 drawing from its best practices.&#13;
&#13;
           Given the importance of participation and the&#13;
&#13;
 fact that Management is well-informed of the process in&#13;
&#13;
 the field, we think that Management can effectively&#13;
&#13;
 provide comments on the participatory process in the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 assessment.   However, in doing so, we think it is&#13;
&#13;
 important to take into account the country-specific&#13;
&#13;
 circumstances and not apply an in-home standard.&#13;
&#13;
           Third is regarding the PRSP and the enhanced&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC Initiative.   In order to ensure the linkage between&#13;
&#13;
 debt relief and poverty alleviation, we believe it is&#13;
&#13;
 important for the HIPCs to have at least an interim PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 at the decision point and demonstrate progress on the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation of the PRSP by the completion point.         For&#13;
&#13;
 such viewpoint, we think it is necessary to have at least&#13;
                                                                    Page45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 a satisfactory first annual progress report before the&#13;
&#13;
 completion point, as stated in the paper.           However, in the&#13;
&#13;
 case of retroactive countries that continue to demonstrate&#13;
&#13;
 strong performance, adoption of the PRSP will be a&#13;
&#13;
 sufficient condition for the completion point.          In other&#13;
&#13;
 words, we rather favor Option 2 in the staff paper.&#13;
&#13;
           Fourth is on links to Bank lending.          This chair&#13;
&#13;
 supports the idea of linking performance and the PRSP and&#13;
&#13;
 Bank lending.    However, IDA lending has been allocated&#13;
&#13;
 based on performance ratings such as portfolio performance&#13;
&#13;
 assessment and CPIA.    We hope that such methodology will&#13;
&#13;
 be reflected in the design of the PRSP of each country.&#13;
&#13;
           Fifth is regarding the importance of ownership&#13;
&#13;
 of the recipient government.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, I understand that this PRSP framework&#13;
&#13;
 in front of us was created under the Bank and Fund&#13;
&#13;
 initiative, but in order for this framework to be owned by&#13;
&#13;
 the recipient government, the Management needs to put most&#13;
&#13;
 emphasis on consultation with the recipient government in&#13;
&#13;
 coming months.   Along with ownership of the recipient&#13;
&#13;
 government, the work by regional development banks and&#13;
&#13;
 other donor agencies could be efficiently integrated into&#13;
&#13;
 the process of PRSP formulation.&#13;
                                                                       Page46&#13;

&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Singh?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SINGH:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           We really welcome this opportunity        to discuss&#13;
&#13;
 this imaginative and well-thought-out document on poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction.   We welcome this because we do feel that&#13;
&#13;
 despite the commendable efforts by national governments,&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank, the Fund, the NGOs, the private sector and&#13;
&#13;
 others, the number of people living on a dollar a day is&#13;
&#13;
 on the rise, and therefore, they need to have a fresh and&#13;
&#13;
 imaginative look at the arrangements.         This PRSP paper&#13;
&#13;
 will help us in that direction.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to confine my comments to four&#13;
&#13;
 aspects of the paper.    The first is country ownership; the&#13;
&#13;
 second is the need for flexibility of approach; the third&#13;
&#13;
 is the cost of preparation of PRSP papers; and the fourth&#13;
&#13;
 is the relationship between the CAS and the PRSP and&#13;
&#13;
 between the CAS, the CDF and PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, we support that PRSPs should be&#13;
&#13;
 country-driven, and the contents and the strategies to&#13;
&#13;
 reduce poverty should be left to the government concerned.&#13;
&#13;
 Although in many countries, the national governments do&#13;
                                                                  Page47&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 have a well-defined strategy for government--we may call&#13;
&#13;
 it a five-year plan or a strategic plan or a vision&#13;
&#13;
 document--the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper will enable&#13;
&#13;
 the government to focus its attention sharply to wage a&#13;
&#13;
 decisive war against poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           Each country, Mr. Chairman, thus has a vision--a&#13;
&#13;
 history with strong points and shortcomings.       It also has&#13;
&#13;
 limited or extended room for the private sector and NGOs,&#13;
&#13;
 and it also has, in the majority of countries, certain&#13;
&#13;
 democratic institutions, parliament, legislative bodies,&#13;
&#13;
 and so on.&#13;
&#13;
           Therefore, the preparation of this paper should&#13;
&#13;
 be left to the country concerned.       The joint missions from&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank and Fund would give advice to the government and&#13;
&#13;
 would also involve themselves in the preparation of the&#13;
&#13;
 document--subject, naturally, to that concerned&#13;
&#13;
 government's approval.    The mission could also give its&#13;
&#13;
 comments on the content and effectiveness of the strategy&#13;
&#13;
 prepared by the government, as well as the nature of the&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process involved in preparing the document.&#13;
&#13;
           Having emphasized this dialogue between the&#13;
&#13;
 national government and Bank and Fund mission, it may not,&#13;
&#13;
 however, be appropriate for the staff to recommend&#13;
                                                                   Page48&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 endorsement or rejection of the paper prepared by a&#13;
&#13;
 sovereign government.    It may be submitted to the Board&#13;
&#13;
 with the observation of the members of the joint mission.&#13;
&#13;
 The Board, after detailed discussion, may convey to the&#13;
&#13;
 concerned government its views, suggestions and&#13;
&#13;
 apprehensions, if any, which may or may not lead to&#13;
&#13;
 modification of the PRSP paper.&#13;
&#13;
           If it is really a country-driven strategy, then&#13;
&#13;
 the final say should rest with the national government&#13;
&#13;
 concerned, and they should be fully responsible for the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation.   Experience has shown that strategies that&#13;
&#13;
 lack ownership and are perceived to have been imposed from&#13;
&#13;
 above are not successful in implementation.&#13;
&#13;
           Once the PRSP is final, the Bank and Fund should&#13;
&#13;
 effectively monitor it and should also visualize that&#13;
&#13;
 whatever may be the degree of commitment and ownership,&#13;
&#13;
 things may go wrong for regions outside the control of the&#13;
&#13;
 government.   Under such circumstances, the Bank/Fund&#13;
&#13;
 should step in and give appropriate advice and help to&#13;
&#13;
 come out of the drift quickly.      For this, an appropriate&#13;
&#13;
 advance warning system and outcome indicators have to be&#13;
&#13;
 developed.&#13;

&#13;
             Regarding the publication of the PRSP, it should&#13;
&#13;
 be widely publicized both by the government and the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
 Transparency itself will lead to wide debate and will&#13;
&#13;
 force the government to correct itself and incorporate&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate strategies in the best interest of the people.&#13;
&#13;
             To sum up, poverty reduction strategies must be&#13;
&#13;
 domestically owned and internally driven.            This is only&#13;
&#13;
 possible if the respective governments themselves decide&#13;
&#13;
 priorities in program objectives.         This is especially true&#13;
&#13;
 for those countries which have democratic institutions in&#13;
&#13;
 place at national, subnational and district levels and&#13;
&#13;
 have set up their developmental priorities and decided the&#13;
&#13;
 pace and scope of their implementation based upon&#13;
&#13;
 constitutional provisions and participatory consultations.&#13;
&#13;
 Such programs should not be constrained by&#13;
&#13;
 conditionalities.&#13;
&#13;
             My second comment is about the flexibility of&#13;
&#13;
 approach.    Several of my colleagues--Stephen, Jan, Pieter&#13;
&#13;
 and others--have already highlighted in the written notes&#13;
&#13;
 that there should be flexibility in approach, and we&#13;
&#13;
 should not be, to use my own phrase, prisoners of our own&#13;
&#13;
 critical models.&#13;
                                                                     Page50&#13;

                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           What is required, therefore, is that we can have&#13;
&#13;
 an approach related to a particular country, and it is not&#13;
&#13;
 necessary that the same strategy must ipso facto be made&#13;
&#13;
 applicable to another country.      There, the Country&#13;
&#13;
 Directors of the Bank in particular will play a very&#13;
&#13;
 important role.&#13;
&#13;
           My third comment, Mr. Chairman, is in relation&#13;
&#13;
 to the cost of PRSP paper preparation.         I thought that for&#13;
&#13;
 very informal consultations between the Bank and the Fund&#13;
&#13;
 and the national government, and also for removing any&#13;
&#13;
 doubts about it, we should offer to meet the cost.        It is&#13;
&#13;
 for the national government to accept it or not to accept&#13;
&#13;
 it.&#13;
&#13;
           My last comment, Mr. Chairman, is about the&#13;
&#13;
 relationship between CAS and PRSP and between CAS, CDF and&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP.   I had said the other day that we must not get&#13;
&#13;
 confused between the contradictions of one document and&#13;
&#13;
 another, because if the two documents are prepared at&#13;
&#13;
 different periods of history by different teams, such&#13;
&#13;
 confusion is possible.    Therefore, an integrated view is&#13;
&#13;
 necessary, and in having that integrated view, I think&#13;
&#13;
 what is required is that the CAS, which is the generic&#13;
&#13;
 document, should have the PRSP also fully taken into&#13;
                                                                     Page51&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 account once the CAS is revised, after the PRSP has been&#13;
&#13;
 prepared.    For countries which have accepted the&#13;
&#13;
 Comprehensive Development Framework, the requirement in my&#13;
&#13;
 view is very sensitive between the CAS, the CDF, and the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP, and this is an area on which further thought it&#13;
&#13;
 possible, but as we go along, we would improve upon it.&#13;
&#13;
             What is therefore crucial is that we should have&#13;
&#13;
 full information about who is doing what in a particular&#13;
&#13;
 country, in a particular region of a country, in regard to&#13;
&#13;
 the removal of poverty, and it is there that the donor&#13;
&#13;
 agencies and the monitoring by the Bank would be of help&#13;
&#13;
 in telling the national government and the donor agencies&#13;
&#13;
 in particular about the need to avoid duplication and to&#13;
&#13;
 have full advantage of the synergy of the different&#13;
&#13;
 organizations.&#13;
&#13;
             Again, Mr. Chairman, the success of the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 lies not in the beauty of its document but in what it&#13;
&#13;
 actually does.    Are we going to reduce the number of&#13;
&#13;
 people, the 1.3 billion people who are living on one&#13;
&#13;
 dollar a day, and how soon?      We are all committed to&#13;
&#13;
 working toward that end.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you very much.&#13;

             MR. WOLFENSOHN:   Thank you very much.&#13;

            Mr. Alyahya.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. ALYAHYA:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            We made a number of comments on this paper&#13;
&#13;
 during last Wednesday's Informal Meeting, and today, I&#13;
&#13;
 will reiterate some of these points, but I will also make&#13;
&#13;
 some references to the internal guidance note.&#13;
&#13;
            First, on ownership and capacity-building, while&#13;
&#13;
 the intention is to let the country prepare the PRSP, it&#13;
&#13;
 is clear that many of the targeted poor countries lack the&#13;
&#13;
 capacity to undertake such a complex task by themselves.&#13;
&#13;
 The Bank and the IMF will, of course, have to provide&#13;
&#13;
 significant support.      In doing so, the two institutions&#13;
&#13;
 should aim at creating sufficient local capacity to enable&#13;
&#13;
 countries to truly prepare homegrown PRSPs.&#13;
&#13;
            It would therefore be important for the two&#13;
&#13;
 Boards to know at one point what kind of technical&#13;
&#13;
 assistance was provided in the preparation of the PRSP and&#13;
&#13;
 by whom.   This could be attached as an annex to the staff&#13;
&#13;
 assessment.&#13;
&#13;
            In my view, unless we take capacity-building&#13;
&#13;
 more seriously and improve the delivery of technical&#13;
&#13;
 assistance, many of these countries will continue to rely&#13;
                                                               Page53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 on donors for the preparation of the PRSP, which in itself&#13;
&#13;
 will underline ownership.&#13;
&#13;
            As for the participatory approach, we agree with&#13;
&#13;
 the staff that participatory processes need to reflect the&#13;
&#13;
 culture, practices and institutions of countries.&#13;
&#13;
 Participatory processes are not easy; they are costly and&#13;
&#13;
 require time and careful preparation.           As the paper points&#13;
&#13;
 out, meeting HIPC and other deadlines puts a limit on this&#13;
&#13;
 time frame.   Financial and technical support will be&#13;
&#13;
 needed.    However, the government should determine the&#13;
&#13;
 modality of the process.&#13;
&#13;
            As for timing of the PRSP rollout, we welcome&#13;
&#13;
 the flexibility provided in the paper for the timing of&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSP rollout.    Given the differences in country&#13;
&#13;
 circumstances, a transition period is needed.          A period of&#13;
&#13;
 two years for some countries, as suggested in the paper,&#13;
&#13;
 would also give countries, donors and international&#13;
&#13;
 institutions time to learn and adapt.           This would also&#13;
&#13;
 prevent interruption of the normal lending program to the&#13;
&#13;
 country.&#13;
&#13;
            As for Bank/Fund collaboration, there has been&#13;
&#13;
 considerable progress between the Bank and Fund.          I am&#13;
&#13;
 particularly pleased to note that we already have&#13;
                                                                       Page54&#13;

                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 procedures for resolving differences of view between the&#13;
&#13;
 two institutions.    As indicated in Footnote 10 of the&#13;
&#13;
 joint paper, remaining differences will be, and I quote,&#13;
&#13;
 "reflected in reports on the country to the Executive&#13;
&#13;
 Boards of the two institutions."&#13;
&#13;
           Since PRSPs are expected to be homegrown, we&#13;
&#13;
 should also expect differences in view between the two&#13;
&#13;
 institutions and the country.        It will be important for&#13;
&#13;
 the two Boards to have an opportunity to hear the&#13;
&#13;
 country's case, perhaps giving the country an opportunity&#13;
&#13;
 to comment on staff assessment, especially when such an&#13;
&#13;
 assessment is negative.      Country comments could be&#13;
&#13;
 included as an attachment to the staff assessment.&#13;
&#13;
           While we would want the Bank and the Fund to&#13;
&#13;
 continue strengthening their collaboration in the interest&#13;
&#13;
 of client countries, we would not encourage the&#13;
&#13;
 introduction of cross-conditionality.           In this context, it&#13;
&#13;
 would be important to ensure that Bank/IMF PRSP missions&#13;
&#13;
 be separate from missions for lending programs.           This&#13;
&#13;
 would also ensure greater objectivity.&#13;
&#13;
           As for the links with IDA operations, the paper&#13;
&#13;
 states in paragraph 42 that, and I quote:            "A Board-&#13;
&#13;
 endorsed PRSP, interim PRSP, or PRSP progress report will&#13;
                                                                       Page55&#13;

                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 be a necessary condition for a high-case lending scenario&#13;
&#13;
 and adjustment lending except in special circumstances&#13;
&#13;
 such as emergency or crisis situations."&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to know if this precludes&#13;
&#13;
 adjustment lending in the base case.        I am aware of the&#13;
&#13;
 note on adjustment lending that Management circulated last&#13;
&#13;
 week, but I would like a clear answer, yes or no.        If&#13;
&#13;
 there is going to be flexibility, how would we ensure&#13;
&#13;
 consistency and equal treatment?&#13;
&#13;
           On the endorsement by the Board, I agree that&#13;
&#13;
 the joint staff assessment accompanying the PRSP should&#13;
&#13;
 recommend to the Board endorsement and not approval, as&#13;
&#13;
 suggested by some during the meeting last week, of the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP.   I also agree that the assessment should not&#13;
&#13;
 recommend to the Board approval or rejection of the&#13;
&#13;
 participatory approach.    Of course, Board members may have&#13;
&#13;
 their own views on this, but such views should not&#13;
&#13;
 influence the endorsement of the PRSP.         The quality of the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP should be judged by the quality of the diagnosis and&#13;
&#13;
 the policy content of the matrix.&#13;
&#13;
           On the link to the HIPC Initiative, I agree that&#13;
&#13;
 an interim PRSP should be in place by decision point and&#13;
&#13;
 that the country should have adopted a PRSP and made&#13;
                                                                     Page56&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 progress in its implementation by completion point.         I&#13;
&#13;
 also agree that this requirement should be relaxed for&#13;
&#13;
 retroactive HIPCs.   They should be required to have only&#13;
&#13;
 adopted a PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
           On Bank preparedness, it is not clear whether&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank is internally fully-prepared to launch this new&#13;
&#13;
 initiative.   My concern is that we rush into this while&#13;
&#13;
 unprepared, as has been the case with other initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
 Clearly, for many countries, the quality of their PRSPs&#13;
&#13;
 will largely depend on the quality and timeliness of the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank's support.&#13;
&#13;
           On administrative, budget and staffing, the&#13;
&#13;
 resource implications of Bank/Fund support of countries in&#13;
&#13;
 the preparation of PRSPs are substantial.          I am pleased to&#13;
&#13;
 note that from the Bank side, the budgetary implications&#13;
&#13;
 for the remainder of FY00 will be made available through&#13;
&#13;
 redeployment.   I am not sure, however, whether such&#13;
&#13;
 redeployment will be carried out within the relevant&#13;
&#13;
 regions or across the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           I note the budgetary implications for FY01, and&#13;
&#13;
 of course, further deployment could be needed, but too&#13;
&#13;
 much redeployment could adversely affect other programs.&#13;
                                                                      Page57&#13;

&#13;
 This should be avoided.     In any case, this will need to be&#13;
&#13;
 considered in the overall context of the post-Compact.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, the PRSPs will have important&#13;
&#13;
 implications to the Executive Directors Work Program.      We&#13;
&#13;
 are confident that Mr. Toure's committee will take a&#13;
&#13;
 careful look at this and advise the Board.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you very much, and we&#13;

&#13;
           Ms. Hollifield?&#13;
&#13;
           MS. HOLLIFIELD:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           The PRSP is an entirely new way of relating to a&#13;
&#13;
 wider range of countries.     As such, it does seem to be a&#13;
&#13;
 natural extension of the CDF, with the focused common goal&#13;
&#13;
 of poverty reduction.    The approach and documents&#13;
&#13;
 themselves must be explicitly pro-poor, and we would&#13;
&#13;
 welcome additional discussion at some point on how to&#13;
&#13;
 mobilize an enhanced relationship between growth and&#13;
&#13;
 equity.&#13;
&#13;
           The challenge for all international development&#13;
&#13;
 players is how to operationalize a new style of&#13;
&#13;
 constructive engagement.    Our authorities are most&#13;
&#13;
 intrigued by the proposed PRSP approach and, depending on&#13;
                                                                 Page58&#13;

&#13;
 the country and their skill set, stand ready to&#13;
&#13;
 participate both in the analytical policy work and with&#13;
&#13;
 implementation and monitoring.       As with the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
 Fund's engagement, they are aware of the difficult balance&#13;
&#13;
 between donor participation and support and country&#13;
&#13;
 ownership.&#13;
&#13;
             We believe that a strong and inclusive&#13;
&#13;
 partnership standing alongside the client should decline&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSP style.&#13;
&#13;
             The role of the Board must also change in&#13;
&#13;
 parallel.    It is best if we are engaged earlier and&#13;
&#13;
 informally in the PRSP process.        In fact, we hope that the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP will demand lots of our time.         Therefore, we will&#13;
&#13;
 need timely documentation for our own consultations.        But&#13;
&#13;
 we will need to be open and flexible, both on&#13;
&#13;
 documentation and on ideas.      We will need to be open to&#13;
&#13;
 new approaches and innovative ideas even when they are in&#13;
&#13;
 contrast with conventional wisdom.&#13;
&#13;
             The interface with the changing CAS will have to&#13;
&#13;
 be carefully managed.     We need a strong effort to create a&#13;
&#13;
 unified process.    While there may be many distinct&#13;
&#13;
 building blocks, we want them to be designed or redesigned&#13;
&#13;
 as necessary to be mutually reinforcing rather than&#13;
                                                                    Page59&#13;

&#13;
 replicating efforts.     In particular, we would want to see&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSP and the CAS explicitly linked, another seamless&#13;
&#13;
 transition.&#13;
&#13;
           The cost issues worry us.          We agree with a&#13;
&#13;
 number of speakers last week who asked that these costs&#13;
&#13;
 not be considered as marginal costs to the Bank, since the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP clearly offers the opportunity for the institution to&#13;
&#13;
 substantively change the approach to client countries and&#13;
&#13;
 to poverty alleviation.      What is more complex and&#13;
&#13;
 interesting, however, are the potential implications for&#13;
&#13;
 countries themselves in terms of their relations with&#13;
&#13;
 donors and their role in their own development dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
 In-country impact is the heart of the matter.          We would be&#13;
&#13;
 very interested to see additional work on the potential&#13;
&#13;
 cost to borrower countries and on the Bank's proposed&#13;
&#13;
 approach for facilitating donor involvement and financing.&#13;
&#13;
           In-country impact extends far beyond costing and&#13;
&#13;
 financing, though.     If the process is to be truly country-&#13;
&#13;
 driven, governments themselves are the key stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
 and must be fully involved in all stages of a poverty&#13;
&#13;
 strategy process.    Mr. Abraham has provided an important&#13;
&#13;
 warning that space must be left for ownership.          We would&#13;
&#13;
 welcome comments from staff on the process that has been&#13;
                                                                      Page60&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 followed so far to include the borrowers.          The interests,&#13;
&#13;
 experiences and capabilities of the PRSP clients are&#13;
&#13;
 essential inputs into the overall PRSP design.&#13;
&#13;
           We would hope that the Bank and Fund will&#13;
&#13;
 systematically seek their input over the months to come,&#13;
&#13;
 not just on country-specific matters but on the emerging&#13;
&#13;
 shape of the PRSPs more generally.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, I would like to reiterate our position&#13;
&#13;
 on the PRSP-HIPC linkages.     We strongly believe that only&#13;
&#13;
 Option 3 is consistent with the timely provision of&#13;
&#13;
 enhanced debt relief for retroactive countries.         These&#13;
&#13;
 countries should not have to convince us all over again on&#13;
&#13;
 their commitments to the HIPC principles.          We should not&#13;
&#13;
 be setting up additional hurdles for countries that need&#13;
&#13;
 our support.   We must work alongside them on their long&#13;
&#13;
 road to achieve sustained growth and poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           We would also suggest that interim PRSPs be used&#13;
&#13;
 where appropriate in other cases, both HIPC and otherwise.&#13;
&#13;
 We don't think we can overstate the enormity of the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 challenge in countries with constrained capacity.         Our&#13;
&#13;
 concessional lending program should not be slowed as&#13;
&#13;
 countries work toward the development of a strong PRSP--a&#13;
&#13;
 goal that we share.&#13;
                                                                     Page61&#13;

&#13;
           This brings me back to the implications for the&#13;
&#13;
 staffs and the Boards of the two institutions.      We will&#13;
&#13;
 need to be open and willing to take some difficult&#13;
&#13;
 judgment calls.   At the end of the day, we will have to&#13;
&#13;
 ascertain whether countries are truly committed to reform&#13;
&#13;
 and have developed strong and credible development&#13;
&#13;
 strategies with broad civil society support.       This is the&#13;
&#13;
 key to success.&#13;

           Thank you.&#13;

           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you, Ms. Hollifield.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Zhu?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. ZHU:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           While we had two discussions about PRSP-related&#13;
&#13;
 issues last week, I welcome the formal Board discussion&#13;
&#13;
 today and would like to make the following observations&#13;
&#13;
 and comments.&#13;
&#13;
           On ownership, I appreciate the emphasis in the&#13;
&#13;
 paper on country ownership and country-specific approach.&#13;
&#13;
 Government ownership is critical to the success of the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP process.   But Mr. Chairman, in my view, the real&#13;
&#13;
 issue is how to secure genuine and full ownership, or&#13;
&#13;
 rather, how to avoid an imposed or cosmetic ownership&#13;
                                                                  Page62&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 which to a large extent may lead to the dominance of a&#13;
&#13;
 Washington consensus.&#13;
&#13;
           If the proposed approach in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 accountancy, format and process is too complicated, then I&#13;
&#13;
 will be very nervous that the ownership will be easily&#13;
&#13;
 lost in the process.&#13;
&#13;
           Also, the PRSP should not shy away from&#13;
&#13;
 presenting differences in the government concerned and the&#13;
&#13;
 two institutions.    What we want to see at the end of the&#13;
&#13;
 day is a candid and honest paper--not a polished one on&#13;
&#13;
 so-called consensus, where eventually there is no&#13;
&#13;
 ownership.   The lack of differences possibly indicates in&#13;
&#13;
 some cases lack of ownership by the government.&#13;
&#13;
           It seems difficult but very important to avoid&#13;
&#13;
 making PRSP a "Christmas tree," trying to cover too many&#13;
&#13;
 areas together at the same time, especially for those not-&#13;
&#13;
 yet-CDF pilot countries.&#13;
&#13;
           Poverty-related agendas also need to be&#13;
&#13;
 consolidated and selective, addressing the focal points,&#13;
&#13;
 particularly the concerns where each of the governments&#13;
&#13;
 select as a top priority external resources support being&#13;
&#13;
 most relevant.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           If the PRSP is a country's own document, then&#13;
&#13;
 the final say definitely should be on the country side.&#13;
&#13;
 The country view should prevail wherever there are&#13;
&#13;
 differences, particularly over timing, sequencing, and the&#13;
&#13;
 pacing of the reform program.      The Bank and the Fund role&#13;
&#13;
 in PRSP preparation should be limited to partners rather&#13;
&#13;
 than as a substitute.&#13;
&#13;
           Special attention at the outset should be&#13;
&#13;
 explicitly paid to the asymmetries between the country, on&#13;
&#13;
 the one hand, and international financial organizations&#13;
&#13;
 and donor communities at large on the other in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 institutional capacity, resource availability, and ways of&#13;
&#13;
 voices particularly for small and independent member&#13;
&#13;
 countries.&#13;
&#13;
           The PRSP logically and legally should be&#13;
&#13;
 regarded as a    ?      document, so it's not appropriate, I&#13;
&#13;
 believe, for the Board to endorse it.         As Mr. Pieter Stek&#13;
&#13;
 rightly pointed out, endorsement might take away the sense&#13;
&#13;
 of ownership in the countries involved, and might alienate&#13;
&#13;
 our partners in the field from what is seen as a&#13;
&#13;
 Washington document.&#13;
&#13;
           On cost implications, I appreciate the&#13;
&#13;
 management's intention to redeploy resources internally in&#13;
                                                                    Page64&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the first year, but inevitably there will be additional&#13;
&#13;
 costs in the process.     In this regard, I hope that we can&#13;
&#13;
 discuss it in the context of the Strategic Compact, and&#13;
&#13;
 also better attention should be paid to the possible&#13;
&#13;
 least-cost solutions.&#13;
&#13;
             And to the extent possible, I would like to call&#13;
&#13;
 for using more experts and consultants from developing&#13;
&#13;
 countries themselves.     In this way, PRSP may technically&#13;
&#13;
 less articulate or perfect, but more cost-effective and&#13;
&#13;
 feasible.    Also, in such a process of involvement of the&#13;
&#13;
 consultants or experts from developing countries&#13;
&#13;
 themselves, borrowing countries may also have a better&#13;
&#13;
 chance to share each other's experiences.&#13;
&#13;
             On the participation process, the Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund should be cautious with participating, respecting the&#13;
&#13;
 rights of the governments to draw the line on their&#13;
&#13;
 engagement.    PRSP should not create the impression that it&#13;
&#13;
 is open to unrealistic public access if the governments do&#13;
&#13;
 not think so.&#13;
&#13;
             How to ensure a meaningful not a biased&#13;
&#13;
 participation is indeed a challenge.         Years of experience&#13;
&#13;
 have proved that civil society is not a homogeneous&#13;
&#13;
 building block, and some special interest groups'&#13;
                                                                    Page65&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 participation may not truly represent the interests of the&#13;
&#13;
 poor in the field.   Their participation may not benefit&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction, and sometimes unfortunately even go to&#13;
&#13;
 the country.   Therefore, a better definition of the&#13;
&#13;
 composition of civil society is urgently needed, given the&#13;
&#13;
 tendency nowadays to lump all organizations outside&#13;
&#13;
 government together without due regard to their diversity&#13;
&#13;
 and their relevance to poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           Another dimension, Mr. Chairman, is that&#13;
&#13;
 participation can be expensive and time-consuming, if&#13;
&#13;
 poorly handled, and may compound the problem of cost of&#13;
&#13;
 doing business with the Bank and the Fund.         So&#13;
&#13;
 participation selectivity must be ensured.&#13;
&#13;
           It makes more sense to focus on working more&#13;
&#13;
 directly with grass-roots participation and reflecting&#13;
&#13;
 local communities' interests rather than going through the&#13;
&#13;
 variety of international NGOs as an intermediary in the&#13;
&#13;
 process of PRSP consultation, and Bank staff assessment in&#13;
&#13;
 this regard must be of neutrality politically.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chairman, it's a little bit confusing to me&#13;
&#13;
 how the Board could comment or judge the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 participation process.    Executive Directors do not have&#13;
&#13;
 the legal right, as such, or the responsibility, even the&#13;
                                                              Page66&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 comparative advantage, in doing so.        How could we make a&#13;
&#13;
 reasonable judgment in this area?       I'd like to hear from&#13;
&#13;
 the management and staff some thoughts.&#13;
&#13;
           On Bank and Fund collaboration, the challenge of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction is daunting.      It requires concerted&#13;
&#13;
 effort by all players based on their comparative&#13;
&#13;
 advantage.   As mentioned above, the Board's role in PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 endorsement may result, unfortunately in some cases, in&#13;
&#13;
 cross-conditionality, and even loss of country ownership,&#13;
&#13;
 especially if each Board has to endorse the overall PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 which includes areas of primary responsibility of the&#13;
&#13;
 other side of 19th Street.&#13;
&#13;
           We are all aware of the risk of further blurring&#13;
&#13;
 the division of labor of the two institutions which has b&#13;
&#13;
 been increasingly less clear-cut.       In this regard, it may&#13;
&#13;
 be advisable to prepare a new matrix to set up detailed&#13;
&#13;
 respective responsibilities of the two institutions in the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP process.&#13;
&#13;
           Joint missions is a good concept, but in&#13;
&#13;
 practice may be difficult to work out.         Efforts also need&#13;
&#13;
 to be made to forge a real team between the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
 staff, with different emphasis, culture, even work cycle.&#13;
                                                                    Page67&#13;

&#13;
 How to ensure the synergy of the two institutions in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of time frame dynamics is indeed a challenge.&#13;
&#13;
           The country, Mr. Chairman, rather than the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 and the Fund should take the lead with all donor&#13;
&#13;
 coordination and be responsible for defining the division&#13;
&#13;
 of labor among donors.    In this regard, I again endorse&#13;
&#13;
 Mr. Pieter Stek's point.    Let me quote: "Let recipient&#13;
&#13;
 countries be free to choose whom they want to turn to for&#13;
&#13;
 assistance in writing their PRSP.       This will not only&#13;
&#13;
 strengthen ownership, but also trust in partnership."&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Well, thank you very much, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Zhu.   I think you raise a number of questions which have&#13;
&#13;
 been touched on by some earlier speakers.&#13;
&#13;
           Certainly, there is no desire to make this a&#13;
&#13;
 cosmetic document.     In fact, the provision is that the&#13;
&#13;
 countries would develop the PRSP and then there will be&#13;
&#13;
 staff commentary on the PRSP.      But I do not believe that&#13;
&#13;
 there is a desire on the part of the Bank or Fund to push&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSP into some particular form or to have it as a&#13;
&#13;
 cosmetic document which is agreed.&#13;
&#13;
           I certainly agree with you about the use of&#13;
&#13;
 local consultants.     It's something that we have been&#13;
                                                                Page68&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 supporting for some time.     But on the issue of&#13;
&#13;
 participation and how you judge it, and on how the Board&#13;
&#13;
 can most effectively decide on the participation issue, I&#13;
&#13;
 think we're going to have to deal with that on a case-by-&#13;
&#13;
 case basis.&#13;
&#13;
           I raised this matter this morning in our&#13;
&#13;
 internal meeting, and I doubt that we could give a&#13;
&#13;
 guideline that would be suitable for every country.    I&#13;
&#13;
 think manifestly there may be differences in approaches&#13;
&#13;
 between countries and that you may bring a different&#13;
&#13;
 approach to the issues than some other countries yourself.&#13;
&#13;
 I think all the countries would probably want us to take a&#13;
&#13;
 country-by-country approach.&#13;
&#13;
           But, again, this issue is in the hands of the&#13;
&#13;
 government.   It's going to be country-led, and then it has&#13;
&#13;
 to come to our Board to take a view as to whether we&#13;
&#13;
 regard it as a Board as having been a satisfactory process&#13;
&#13;
 for the Board.   No doubt, we will all have, over time,&#13;
&#13;
 some judgments that might be useful, but I will ask my&#13;
&#13;
 team to try and see if we can come up with some&#13;
&#13;
 guidelines.   But, frankly, I think it would be very&#13;
&#13;
 difficult to do so, even acknowledging the distinction you&#13;

&#13;
 are making between international NGOs and local NGOs.         But&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps practice will determine that.&#13;
&#13;
           And so far as the Bank and the Fund is&#13;
&#13;
 concerned, I think it's clear that there are a number of&#13;
&#13;
 areas that we need to work together on to clarify our&#13;
&#13;
 operating procedures.    I'd be surprised if we could come&#13;
&#13;
 up with a matrix, or would maybe even want to.&#13;
&#13;
           What I think is important is that the Managing&#13;
&#13;
 Director and I have agreed that we should seek to work&#13;
&#13;
 together in developing this, and that there are some areas&#13;
&#13;
 of apparent strengths and weaknesses on either side of&#13;
&#13;
 19th Street, and that what I have learned already from my&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues is that the initial efforts and the initial&#13;
&#13;
 discussions are being done in a very flexible and a very&#13;
&#13;
 communal way between the two of us.&#13;
&#13;
           And I think it may be better to let it develop&#13;
&#13;
 rather than trying to impose something on it that we would&#13;
&#13;
 discuss in advance at the Board.       I think so far it is&#13;
&#13;
 working rather well in terms of the cooperation and in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of the flexibility that we're seeking.       It is&#13;
&#13;
 something that is rather new for both of us, but I would&#13;
&#13;
 counsel the Board that we should let it move forward and&#13;
&#13;
 learn as we go.&#13;
                                                                     Page70&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             I think our teams have a pretty good idea of&#13;
&#13;
 what is needed, and I think putting too fine a point on it&#13;
&#13;
 might lead us to a bureaucratic discussion that we all&#13;
&#13;
 want to avoid.    So my instinct would be that we should let&#13;
&#13;
 it develop and review it regularly, but not review it so&#13;
&#13;
 regularly that we kill something that is emerging and&#13;
&#13;
 where each side is getting some sense of the other.&#13;
&#13;
             At the moment, I'm rather happy with the way&#13;
&#13;
 things are going, and I believe that is the view of the&#13;
&#13;
 Managing Director as well.       And my instinct would be to&#13;
&#13;
 let it move forward and review it as we move forward in&#13;
&#13;
 particular cases.    And then the Board can--we can all&#13;
&#13;
 learn together.    It is something different for the Board&#13;
&#13;
 as well, for both Boards, as evidenced by the fact that&#13;
&#13;
 the Boards feel the need to talk together and meet&#13;
&#13;
 together.&#13;
&#13;
             So we're on new territory, but I find it&#13;
&#13;
 exciting.    It's a new millennium, maybe a new day for all&#13;
&#13;
 of us, and I suggest that we move slowly, but cautiously&#13;
&#13;
 and effectively together.&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Meyer?&#13;
&#13;
             MR. MEYER:   Thank you, Chair.           I think you're&#13;
&#13;
 right.   There is a new day and a new millennium.             Also,&#13;
                                                                       Page71&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 we're starting out the new millennium with an overload, I&#13;
&#13;
 think, which is maybe healthy.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to associate myself to a lot of&#13;
&#13;
 what has been said, and we would like to associate&#13;
&#13;
 ourselves particularly with Mr. Pickford's statement, I&#13;
&#13;
 think, which expresses best our--we might call it in&#13;
&#13;
 French sensibilite, or our sensitivity which I think is,&#13;
&#13;
 in fact, what we should be talking about.          Most of us have&#13;
&#13;
 very similar views, but then some of us are more&#13;
&#13;
 judgmental than others, and some of us have more&#13;
&#13;
 confidence in local processes than others.&#13;
&#13;
           And so this is a very soft kind of discussion&#13;
&#13;
 which we can have right now because, in fact, in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 substance we don't know anything right now, because we're&#13;
&#13;
 basically dealing with the maybe most difficult problem in&#13;
&#13;
 our work, which is what is the right development and what&#13;
&#13;
 is the right theory for development, and how is growth&#13;
&#13;
 related to inequality in poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           As others, I do hope that this process in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of the substance of what will become PRSPs, and so on, can&#13;
&#13;
 be heavily inspired by the discussion on the WDR&#13;
&#13;
 2000/2001.   In terms of process, I think we all have ahead&#13;
&#13;
 of us a relatively long interim period where we have to do&#13;
                                                                      Page72&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 a lot of cost planning, and at the same time not create&#13;
&#13;
 any undue burden for successful HIPC countries because of&#13;
&#13;
 this new process.&#13;
&#13;
            And in that sense, I think one of the things we&#13;
&#13;
 should be doing is exactly to look at how successful&#13;
&#13;
 countries do maybe present models in terms of ownership&#13;
&#13;
 and in terms of participatory processes.             I think one of&#13;
&#13;
 the things we should be doing very clearly is, since we do&#13;
&#13;
 not have at the present time any way to judge that&#13;
&#13;
 process, is to have in place kind of a monitoring and&#13;
&#13;
 evaluation system when the first PRSPs are being presented&#13;
&#13;
 to the Board.   I think we do have to have common ground in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of how we want to monitor the process and what are&#13;
&#13;
 the essential elements of success and failure in the&#13;
&#13;
 process.&#13;
&#13;
            Relating to ownership, obviously everybody likes&#13;
&#13;
 to talk about this.     We just this morning thought about&#13;
&#13;
 ownership of long-term strategies in the case of Poland,&#13;
&#13;
 in the case of Switzerland.       We couldn't discover any&#13;
&#13;
 written document which goes beyond four years, and&#13;
&#13;
 certainly we couldn't discover any document which is being&#13;
&#13;
 taken seriously in the political system.             So this is just,&#13;
&#13;
 you know, a hint of how maybe difficult it is, or maybe&#13;
                                                                         Page73&#13;

                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 how such long-term strategies and processes are not&#13;
&#13;
 necessarily very transparent or very rational to the&#13;
&#13;
 outside world in any countries.&#13;
&#13;
            Now, here, when we talk about ownership, I think&#13;
&#13;
 one of the important things is not to dream.       HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 countries are the poorest countries in the world and if&#13;
&#13;
 they are going to do a PRSP, it's not just because they&#13;
&#13;
 would like to do that; it's also because they have a very&#13;
&#13;
 heavy debt burden and they expect financing.       And so they&#13;
&#13;
 obviously will do this in the context of high dependency&#13;
&#13;
 and in expectation that such a PRSP is going to lead to&#13;
&#13;
 support.   And that, of course, to some extent might limit&#13;
&#13;
 the real autonomy of that process.&#13;
&#13;
            So I think it's better maybe to accept that such&#13;
&#13;
 a process is not totally autonomous and that it has to&#13;
&#13;
 serve a purpose internationally.       And what concretely&#13;
&#13;
 means, I think, is that we should probably endorse a PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
 I think what Bank management proposes is a correct&#13;
&#13;
 compromise.   And clearly, as Lewis Holden said, this&#13;
&#13;
 process and the PRSP has to be relevant for support later&#13;
&#13;
 on.   In other words, the CAS will become some kind of a&#13;
&#13;
 business plan.&#13;
                                                                  Page74&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           In that sense, although I share a lot of what my&#13;
&#13;
 Chinese colleague just said and what Pieter Stek said in&#13;
&#13;
 his statement, I do not concur with their conclusion which&#13;
&#13;
 I consider not to be realistic as part of a process where&#13;
&#13;
 we expect should lead to major contributions from the&#13;
&#13;
 international community to local processes.&#13;
&#13;
           Now, in terms of the Bank, what this reflection&#13;
&#13;
 implies, I think, is that the Bank has to be interested in&#13;
&#13;
 the first stage in the analysis and the participatory&#13;
&#13;
 process for creating a PRSP.      I think the Bank and other&#13;
&#13;
 institutions should provide support, strong support.               And&#13;
&#13;
 I would like to reiterate that this is not just a question&#13;
&#13;
 of capacity-building.    This goes well beyond some kind of&#13;
&#13;
 a very general concept of capacity-building.            It implies&#13;
&#13;
 methods of support and of analysis which are not very&#13;
&#13;
 common in the past of the Bank and which so far have not&#13;
&#13;
 been very explicit.&#13;
&#13;
           Whenever we talk in CASs about whether a&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process was a good one or a bad one, we&#13;
&#13;
 always hear that it was very good.        And how do we measure&#13;
&#13;
 it?   Well, there were so many workshops, and these and&#13;
&#13;
 these and these circles were consulted.            We never hear&#13;
&#13;
 anything about the real content of those consultations,&#13;
                                                                          Page75&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 about who was active or passive in those consultations,&#13;
&#13;
 and how this contributed to reinforce existing local&#13;
&#13;
 processes of checks and balances and consultations.&#13;
&#13;
           And clearly, again, how this works, how far this&#13;
&#13;
 process can go depends a lot on the local circumstances,&#13;
&#13;
 depends a lot on the specific systems.         And that means&#13;
&#13;
 that the Bank itself will have to learn a lot about how to&#13;
&#13;
 judge and how to move in local political systems.        And&#13;
&#13;
 that is a difficult task, but it is a learning task for&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank, and I would not just like to stay at the level&#13;
&#13;
 of saying this is just a question of capacity-building.&#13;
&#13;
           Links with HIPC.     We are clearly for Option 3.&#13;
&#13;
 We feel that here Jan Piercy is taking too tough of a&#13;
&#13;
 stance.   We do have confidence that in retroactive cases&#13;
&#13;
 that we have important poverty strategies, poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategies and planning in place, and we should&#13;
&#13;
 not unduly lengthen that process.&#13;
&#13;
           We also feel that the whole planning of&#13;
&#13;
 countries should be very transparent, and in that sense we&#13;
&#13;
 would like to know at the present time, when Bank staff&#13;
&#13;
 talks about four countries, in addition to the three or&#13;
&#13;
 four mentioned, which are the countries which are&#13;
&#13;
 presently anticipated to come forward and at what time.&#13;
                                                                 Page76&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, staffing.    We think that this might&#13;
&#13;
 present a problem, exactly because I think the challenge&#13;
&#13;
 is substantial.    I think there will be a question of&#13;
&#13;
 staffing in the Fund and in the Bank.          We think that to&#13;
&#13;
 have as a basis a redeployment option both in the Fund and&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank is probably a correct assumption.          But we have to&#13;
&#13;
 revisit this, as it was said, very closely and look into&#13;
&#13;
 the cost question, all this related to clearly a much&#13;
&#13;
 stronger role and a more participatory role of the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
 the first stage.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. WOLFENSOHN:   Thank you, Mr. Meyer.&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Balduino?&#13;
&#13;
             MR. BALDUINO:   Thank you very much, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman.    There are a number of points mentioned in the&#13;
&#13;
 document that we fully agree with and very much welcome.&#13;
&#13;
 Let me start by mentioning them briefly.&#13;
&#13;
             First, the recognition that rapid and&#13;
&#13;
 sustainable economic growth is necessary, although not a&#13;
&#13;
 sufficient condition for poverty reduction, and that, in&#13;
&#13;
 turn, sound macroeconomic policies and management and a&#13;
&#13;
 thriving private sector which is actively investing in&#13;
&#13;
 sound sectoral policies are all necessary conditions for&#13;
                                                                      Page77&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 sustainable growth, and therefore necessary conditions for&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction, too.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, the recognition that there are wide&#13;
&#13;
 differences among countries in terms of the determinants&#13;
&#13;
 of poverty, their type of governments and their&#13;
&#13;
 representative nature, the possibilities for actively&#13;
&#13;
 involving civil society, local capacity, and available of&#13;
&#13;
 data, and that because of all these differences we need to&#13;
&#13;
 be realistic about what can be achieved, recognizing that&#13;
&#13;
 there will be differences in the content and nature of the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSPs and the way that they are prepared.            There is no&#13;
&#13;
 blueprint or ideal model for a PRSP or of participatory&#13;
&#13;
 processes that can be suited to all, and over-ambition in&#13;
&#13;
 this case may lead to paralysis.&#13;
&#13;
           And, third, we very much welcome the notion that&#13;
&#13;
 the preparation of the PRSP has to be country-driven, and&#13;
&#13;
 we hope that we're not going to pay just lip service to&#13;
&#13;
 this notion.&#13;
&#13;
           Fourth, there are many things that we simply&#13;
&#13;
 still do not know and therefore should be subject to&#13;
&#13;
 further analysis.    Also, we have to be careful on the&#13;
&#13;
 advice we extend to these areas and avoid being too&#13;

&#13;
           The first of these issues on which there is not&#13;
&#13;
 yet firm knowledge ranges from the very major ones, such&#13;
&#13;
 as what are the determinants of poverty, given the&#13;
&#13;
 national situation, to what are the links between higher&#13;
&#13;
 spending and the desired intermediate indicators and&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes, and what these indicators and outcomes could be.&#13;
&#13;
 These are all very important points that the document&#13;
&#13;
 spells out and with which we fully agree.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me make some additional points on four&#13;
&#13;
 issues on participatory process, the role of the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
 the Fund, the transitional arrangements, and the role of&#13;
&#13;
 the Board and external partners.&#13;
&#13;
           On participatory process, there is an innovation&#13;
&#13;
 proposed that the PRSP should be prepared by governments,&#13;
&#13;
 with broad participation of elected institutions, civil&#13;
&#13;
 society, and external partners.       The idea is that this&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process would enhance design and&#13;
&#13;
 implementation.   The document makes the point with which&#13;
&#13;
 we agree that there can be no ready guidelines or general&#13;
&#13;
 models for the participatory process.         We also agree with&#13;
&#13;
 the proposal that the staff should not try to access the&#13;
&#13;
 quality of the participatory process in the joint staff&#13;
&#13;
 assessment.&#13;
                                                                    Page79&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           There are no general models on how this should&#13;
&#13;
 be conducted.   The process should be coordinated and&#13;
&#13;
 conducted by the government and other elected political&#13;
&#13;
 institutions, and they should always have the last word in&#13;
&#13;
 the decisionmaking process.      That's why we think it's note&#13;
&#13;
 necessary to have a feedback process on the strategy&#13;
&#13;
 adopted to those that are consulted, especially in a legal&#13;
&#13;
 sense and especially where these are not provided for&#13;
&#13;
 within the country's legal framework.&#13;
&#13;
           And we think that in the end, a well-established&#13;
&#13;
 political system based on free and fair elections which&#13;
&#13;
 possesses itself mechanisms for consultation of interested&#13;
&#13;
 parties in the form of public hearings and consultations&#13;
&#13;
 is the best participatory process that we could have.&#13;
&#13;
           On the role of the Bank and the Fund, we think&#13;
&#13;
 that there should be not a provision of technical analysis&#13;
&#13;
 by staff too early in the process, but perhaps at an&#13;
&#13;
 intermediate stage.    There is a true risk that we come out&#13;
&#13;
 with not a very consistent document, but this is the price&#13;
&#13;
 of learning.    We may have to choose between a good process&#13;
&#13;
 and a good document, and there may be many countries that&#13;
&#13;
 have received so much advice in past years that they have&#13;
                                                                  Page80&#13;

&#13;
 just not become accustomed to think for themselves on&#13;
&#13;
 their own priorities and their own development needs.&#13;
&#13;
            On the role of the Boards, it is suggested that&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSP could become the basis for concessional lending&#13;
&#13;
 by the Bank and the Fund.     It is important, however, to&#13;
&#13;
 avoid cross-conditionality, and the two Boards should&#13;
&#13;
 focus only on those parts of the PRSP that relate directly&#13;
&#13;
 to the programs of each institution, and the different&#13;
&#13;
 mandates should be really maintained.&#13;
&#13;
            Let me add that we are really concerned with the&#13;
&#13;
 legal implications of this whole question of endorsement.&#13;
&#13;
 Maybe the suggestion made by Lewis Holden is a good one&#13;
&#13;
 that the Board would only take notice of the PRSP, but&#13;
&#13;
 instead of endorsing that document, just endorse whatever&#13;
&#13;
 strategy that the different staffs propose.        Since the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP could be some part of the CAS process, the Boards&#13;
&#13;
 would then be endorsing the strategy rather than the CAS&#13;
&#13;
 again and not the document itself.        And we would urge that&#13;
&#13;
 a legal clarification be made because this can have&#13;
&#13;
 implications for international law beyond the Bretton&#13;
&#13;
 Woods institutions, depending on how this issue is&#13;
&#13;
 phrased.&#13;
                                                                    Page81&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            On transitional issues, we think that the&#13;
&#13;
 transitional arrangements between the present situation&#13;
&#13;
 and the new approach that is being proposed--to say that&#13;
&#13;
 we fully support the orientation suggested that the new&#13;
&#13;
 approach should be implemented without interrupting or&#13;
&#13;
 reducing the present flow of concessional financing&#13;
&#13;
 provided to low-income countries.        To do otherwise would&#13;
&#13;
 be like depriving a patient from an existing medicine&#13;
&#13;
 under the argument that a better one would be developed&#13;
&#13;
 soon.    This is particularly important in the case of the&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC countries, and therefore we fully support Option 3&#13;
&#13;
 that envisages the possibility of a collapse of the&#13;
&#13;
 decision and completion points for the retroactive cases.&#13;
&#13;
            On the role of external donors, the document&#13;
&#13;
 claims that donors should actively participate and&#13;
&#13;
 indicate their preferences during the design phase of the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSPs.   The argument is that if they do that, then they&#13;
&#13;
 would make a medium-term financial commitment in support&#13;
&#13;
 of the strategy.   That is in paragraph 57.&#13;
&#13;
            We would like to listen from staff what kind of&#13;
&#13;
 preferences they are talking about here.            Is it just&#13;
&#13;
 preferences about which of the components they would like&#13;
&#13;
 to choose to finance, and if that is the case, why they&#13;
                                                                  Page82&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 should be involved in the design phase and not to wait&#13;
&#13;
 until the strategy is finalized.       Or is it the preferences&#13;
&#13;
 about what should be done, in which case they would have&#13;
&#13;
 indeed been involved in the design phase.           But then this&#13;
&#13;
 raises very serious problems of legitimacy and the danger&#13;
&#13;
 that ownership would not be transformed into donorship, as&#13;
&#13;
 has been mentioned in other meetings here at this forum.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to ask staff how firm these&#13;
&#13;
 financial commitments by external donors would be done.&#13;
&#13;
 Would there be a formal mechanism to bind these external&#13;
&#13;
 donors to their commitments?      What if they participate&#13;
&#13;
 actively in the design, exert influence, and then shy away&#13;
&#13;
 from the financing?   What would happen then?&#13;
&#13;
           The document also mentions in paragraph 59 that&#13;
&#13;
 external partners will have to reinforce their actions by&#13;
&#13;
 increasing aid flows, unrestricted market access.           We&#13;
&#13;
 mostly support these ideas, but again I would like to know&#13;
&#13;
 what is the plan for how to make these ideas firm&#13;
&#13;
 commitments.&#13;
&#13;
           In terms of review and publication, let me&#13;
&#13;
 finally say that we agree with the proposal to have a full&#13;
&#13;
 review of the program by the year 2001.            And we think that&#13;
&#13;
 in addition to the one to be prepared jointly by both&#13;
                                                                        Page83&#13;

 staffs, there also should be one done by independent&#13;
&#13;
 external evaluators, like those we had on surveillance&#13;
&#13;
 indicators of the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
             The PRSP documents, as we understand them, will&#13;
&#13;
 be documents fully written by the countries concerned.       So&#13;
&#13;
 it should be up to them to decide the best moment for&#13;
&#13;
 publication.    If they decide to publish them before Board&#13;
&#13;
 discussion, we would not object.        And as to the document&#13;
&#13;
 that we are considering, we would favor that first we make&#13;
&#13;
 the changes in the document that would emerge from both&#13;
&#13;
 Boards before going public on them.&#13;

             Thank you very much.&#13;

             MR. WOLFENSOHN:   Well, thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Before calling on Mr. Pesme, I'll just explain&#13;
&#13;
 that I was unable to put off a 12:15 date that I have.&#13;
&#13;
 Mr. Sandstrom has been sitting right through these&#13;
&#13;
 meetings with me and we have been in contact through the&#13;
&#13;
 meetings.    We have already prepared a current summary&#13;
&#13;
 which will be amended by subsequent observations on which&#13;
&#13;
 we have agreed.&#13;
&#13;
             I have asked him if he would continue with this&#13;
&#13;
 meeting.    I apologize for the fact that I cannot put off&#13;
&#13;
 this 12:15 date, but I was very grateful to be able to&#13;
                                                                   Page84&#13;

&#13;
 participate in this part of the discussions.         And if I&#13;
&#13;
 may--since this evening I'm going to leave for vacation,&#13;
&#13;
 if I could take this chance to wish you all a happy&#13;
&#13;
 holiday season, and I look forward to seeing you in the&#13;
&#13;
 next millennium and hope that you have a great time with&#13;
&#13;
 your families and safe travel and no Y2K problems for the&#13;
&#13;
 end of the year.&#13;
&#13;
           So thank you all very much.         I'll ask Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Sandstrom to take over.     Mr. Pesme, you are next.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PESME:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.      Happy&#13;
&#13;
 holidays to you, also, and I think I can say it on behalf&#13;
&#13;
 of all my colleagues.     And I think all of us deserve&#13;
&#13;
 vacations, given the workload in the recent weeks.           But&#13;
&#13;
 happy holidays.&#13;
&#13;
           On the specific subject, at the outset I would&#13;
&#13;
 like to sincerely commend IMF and Bank management and&#13;
&#13;
 staff for the preparation in such a short time frame of&#13;
&#13;
 the set of papers before us which provide a very sound&#13;
&#13;
 basis to respond to the challenging objectives for poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction agreed during the Annual Meetings.&#13;
&#13;
           What is proposed is indeed a fundamental step&#13;
&#13;
 forward toward enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction, following a comprehensive and&#13;
                                                                    Page85&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 integrated approach which we very much welcome.     As noted&#13;
&#13;
 by several previous speakers, the discussion today is only&#13;
&#13;
 a first step in this endeavor, given the needed ambition&#13;
&#13;
 of the approach, but also the necessity to be successful&#13;
&#13;
 to involve all parties at stake.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to comment on three aspects:&#13;
&#13;
 substance of the PRSPs, ownership and participatory&#13;
&#13;
 processes, and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
           On substance, we strongly believe that two&#13;
&#13;
 pitfalls must be avoided.      On the one hand, any attempt to&#13;
&#13;
 set a rigid framework would lead to undue delays, in&#13;
&#13;
 particularly in the context of HIPC II which calls for&#13;
&#13;
 faster debt relief.    On the other hand, the absence of a&#13;
&#13;
 minimal content is very likely to undermine the&#13;
&#13;
 effectiveness of the PRSP process and to give room to&#13;
&#13;
 arbitrariness and unfair treatment among countries.&#13;
&#13;
           On balance, we therefore believe that a minimal&#13;
&#13;
 framework is needed, which we expect to be implemented&#13;
&#13;
 with pragmatism.   Such a minimal framework seems to be&#13;
&#13;
 necessary to ensure that general lessons are applied where&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate, that no major block of poverty reduction is&#13;
&#13;
 forgotten, and finally in the HIPC context that the&#13;
                                                                  Page86&#13;

                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate basis for comparison between countries is in&#13;
&#13;
 place.&#13;
&#13;
           Of course, two major principles must lead the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation of such a framework.        First, PRSPs are&#13;
&#13;
 designed to be and must be country-driven.         Second, as&#13;
&#13;
 emphasized in the WDR outline, more and more attention has&#13;
&#13;
 to be paid to country specifics, likely leading to very&#13;
&#13;
 different emphasis on the building blocks of this minimal&#13;
&#13;
 framework in each country.&#13;
&#13;
           At this stage, the set of questions in Box 3 of&#13;
&#13;
 the document provides a useful basis for such a framework,&#13;
&#13;
 but we believe that much more could be said, in&#13;
&#13;
 particular, on dimensions which are potentially more&#13;
&#13;
 difficult at the country level.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me be more specific.       First, we strongly&#13;
&#13;
 support the emphasis in the document on the need to ensure&#13;
&#13;
 consistency between macroeconomic, structural and social&#13;
&#13;
 policies and the goals of poverty reduction.        Growth&#13;
&#13;
 remains crucial, and no sustainable outcome will be&#13;
&#13;
 achieved without some macro policies, not to mention that&#13;
&#13;
 essential elements of these macro policies, such as&#13;
&#13;
 inflation and tax policies, for instance, have a direct&#13;
&#13;
 impact on distribution patterns.&#13;
                                                                 Page87&#13;

&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Second, we welcome the multi-dimensional&#13;
&#13;
 approach of poverty reduction laid in the paper, but such&#13;
&#13;
 a comprehensive approach must not undermine the need for&#13;
&#13;
 sharpness.   The document puts, in our view, an appropriate&#13;
&#13;
 emphasis on the determinants of poverty, which applies&#13;
&#13;
 that the IMF and the World Bank must provide early enough&#13;
&#13;
 in the process support for broad-based assessment, not&#13;
&#13;
 shying away from potentially contentious issues, such as&#13;
&#13;
 good governance and budget transparency, for instance.&#13;
&#13;
           This process is crucial, in our view, to make&#13;
&#13;
 sure that we do not rush into easy and short-sighted&#13;
&#13;
 solutions.   If each country will have to determine its own&#13;
&#13;
 solutions, in particularly in the determination of the&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate pressure points, we also have the&#13;
&#13;
 responsibility to help them tackle the complexity of the&#13;
&#13;
 issues.&#13;
&#13;
           As mentioned by several speakers in the last&#13;
&#13;
 days, we cannot avoid facing the weaknesses of the&#13;
&#13;
 analysis on causal relationships.       By contrast, it calls,&#13;
&#13;
 in our view, for strong attention to encompass at the&#13;
&#13;
 country level all the dimensions of poverty.       In this&#13;
&#13;
 respect, we also welcome the proposal to establish&#13;
&#13;
 stronger links between the IMF and the Bank lending&#13;
                                                                  Page88&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 programs on the basis of the PRSP implementation so that&#13;
&#13;
 this comprehensive approach is reflected in the dialogue&#13;
&#13;
 between the country and the two institutions.&#13;
&#13;
           This being said, each institution will have to&#13;
&#13;
 maintain a strong focus on its areas of primary&#13;
&#13;
 responsibility, as proposed by staff, and will have to&#13;
&#13;
 rely heavily on the other's expertise.         It implies that&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate attention has to be paid to delivery on each&#13;
&#13;
 side, and that a very strong ongoing dialogue will have to&#13;
&#13;
 take place between the IMF and the Bank to avoid delays in&#13;
&#13;
 any problem resolution process.&#13;
&#13;
           To summarize on this point, we concur with the&#13;
&#13;
 main thrust of the paper, but we think it puts so far too&#13;
&#13;
 much emphasis on the processes at the expense of the&#13;
&#13;
 substance.   Pragmatism and judgment calls will be of the&#13;
&#13;
 essence, but we remain convinced that there is room for&#13;
&#13;
 further work on a minimal framework.&#13;
&#13;
           On ownership and participatory processes, we&#13;
&#13;
 strongly welcome the attention paid in the paper to these&#13;
&#13;
 two dimensions which have proven crucial in long-term&#13;
&#13;
 sustainability of poverty reduction efforts.        Pieter Stek&#13;
&#13;
 makes interesting comments on participation as an end in&#13;
                                                                   Page89&#13;

&#13;
 his written statement, and we concur with the need to&#13;
&#13;
 implement bottom-up approaches to a greater extent.&#13;
&#13;
           This being said, it is also very likely that the&#13;
&#13;
 dialogue on policies will also have to rely on some top-&#13;
&#13;
 down aspects at the country level, in particular to make&#13;
&#13;
 sure that appropriate distance is taken between assessment&#13;
&#13;
 and design of public policies.&#13;
&#13;
           The obvious solutions are not always the most&#13;
&#13;
 efficient in the long run, even if it is crucial that we&#13;
&#13;
 do not force solutions.    This will clearly be one of the&#13;
&#13;
 trickiest aspects of the PRSP, and one has to be careful&#13;
&#13;
 not to be prescriptive at the outset.         And we agree that&#13;
&#13;
 we will have to learn from experience.&#13;
&#13;
           But, on balance, in the short run we also have&#13;
&#13;
 to remain very aware that additional financing provided&#13;
&#13;
 under HIPC II will have to be actually supportive of&#13;
&#13;
 efficient and effective policies.       More generally, we have&#13;
&#13;
 to maintain the IMF and the Bank and other donors' ability&#13;
&#13;
 to express comments and, when necessary, strong&#13;
&#13;
 disagreements on the priorities and timetables set at the&#13;
&#13;
 country level.&#13;
&#13;
           This being said, it is crucial, in our view, for&#13;
&#13;
 the Bretton Woods institutions to respect each country's&#13;
                                                                   Page90&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 internal political and representative mechanisms.      We must&#13;
&#13;
 not enter into a process in which we would establish any&#13;
&#13;
 norm or standard regarding participatory approach.      And we&#13;
&#13;
 call for great caution in the development of the tool kits&#13;
&#13;
 from this standpoint.    We would not support any request to&#13;
&#13;
 have the staffs of the institutions commenting on these&#13;
&#13;
 processes beyond the existing mechanisms in each country;&#13;
&#13;
 i.e., beyond, among others, involvement of parliaments and&#13;
&#13;
 legitimate local authorities.&#13;
&#13;
           On implementation, we globally concur with staff&#13;
&#13;
 proposals regarding implementation, including the interim&#13;
&#13;
 PRSPs.   We would nevertheless appreciate staff's further&#13;
&#13;
 comments on the time frame for the exit of the interim&#13;
&#13;
 period beyond the case-by-case approach proposed.       And I&#13;
&#13;
 would like to make four additional comments on&#13;
&#13;
 implementation.&#13;
&#13;
           First, on the relationship with the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 Initiative, we believe it important, in steady state, to&#13;
&#13;
 link the decision point to a fully-fledged PRSP and&#13;
&#13;
 completion point to satisfactory implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy for at least one year.       We are ready to accept&#13;
&#13;
 some flexibility for the early cases on the basis of&#13;
&#13;
 Option 2 proposed by staff.&#13;
                                                                  Page91&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            For some exceptional cases where retroactive&#13;
&#13;
 countries have so far demonstrated strong progress in the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation of their national poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy, we do not exclude up front to cut off the&#13;
&#13;
 completion and decision points, but a case-by-case&#13;
&#13;
 discussion will have to take place to justify such an&#13;
&#13;
 exceptional measure.   The additional debt relief provided&#13;
&#13;
 by HIPC II must be strongly embedded in the recipient&#13;
&#13;
 country's fight against poverty, and we would have to&#13;
&#13;
 measure that for each country upcoming.&#13;
&#13;
            Two, we support the idea of both IMF and Bank&#13;
&#13;
 Board endorsement of the PRSP because of the very strong&#13;
&#13;
 link with the two institutions' lending program which we&#13;
&#13;
 support.   We are reluctant to limit this endorsement to&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank and IMF elements, since in itself the PRSP must&#13;
&#13;
 represent a comprehensive and integrated approach of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
            Our own selective business plan reflected in the&#13;
&#13;
 CAS must be built on a broad-based agreement with the&#13;
&#13;
 overall strategy, informed by the joint assessment&#13;
&#13;
 provided by staff of the two institutions.         As I mentioned&#13;
&#13;
 last Thursday, we also see some room for improvement in&#13;
&#13;
 the articulation between PRSPs and CASs, including on the&#13;
                                                                     Page92&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 definition of conditionality and triggers for lending&#13;
&#13;
 scenario.    And I would like to associate myself with the&#13;
&#13;
 comments made by Lewis on these points, including on the&#13;
&#13;
 role of the joint assessment.&#13;
&#13;
             Third, we support the proposal for disclosure of&#13;
&#13;
 the various documents, and reiterate our request to make&#13;
&#13;
 publicly available a timetable for the up to 11 countries&#13;
&#13;
 likely to come to the Boards before the spring meetings,&#13;
&#13;
 assuming reasonably progress on macro stability and&#13;
&#13;
 structural reform.       And as mentioned on Wednesday, Table 2&#13;
&#13;
 in the costing paper provides, in our view, a good basis&#13;
&#13;
 for such communication.&#13;
&#13;
             Four, we support the proposal to review the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 process in 2001 if we have a feeling that further&#13;
&#13;
 discussion might be warranted on the scope of this review.&#13;
&#13;
 Like others, we favor some independence in the review,&#13;
&#13;
 including through strong endorsement of OED.        We&#13;
&#13;
 nevertheless have to be careful on the role of NGOs in&#13;
&#13;
 such a process, and further discussion seems needed on&#13;
&#13;
 this last point.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;

           I have four more names on my list--Reinermann,&#13;
&#13;
 Al-Saad, Toure, and Passacantando.&#13;
&#13;
           Dirk, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. REINERMANN:    Thank you, Chairman.     The&#13;
&#13;
 discussion of both Boards last week and today were very&#13;
&#13;
 helpful to give the Boards comfort to give the start&#13;
&#13;
 signal for a PRSP rollout today and to start&#13;
&#13;
 implementation.&#13;
&#13;
           Certainly, many open questions remain and staff&#13;
&#13;
 gave a very good summary initially of those open questions&#13;
&#13;
 and tensions.   But our opinion is one can only take this&#13;
&#13;
 discussion on general tension so far and there comes a&#13;
&#13;
 point when one must take this discussion to a country&#13;
&#13;
 level, and we feel that this time is now and we need to&#13;
&#13;
 revisit the issue once we have some more country-based&#13;
&#13;
 experience.&#13;
&#13;
           I would just like to mention some points that&#13;
&#13;
 would need attention up front.      The first is the issue of&#13;
&#13;
 how the Boards treat PRSPs, the question of endorsement,&#13;
&#13;
 and we believe this is more than a housekeeping issue,&#13;
&#13;
 this is more than a semantic issue.        This probably goes to&#13;
&#13;
 the core of what is intended through PRSP, and in that&#13;
&#13;
 sense it could be a symptom of a deeper issue.&#13;
                                                                    Page94&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             We appreciate staff's clarification that by&#13;
&#13;
 endorsement it is not meant to find a legal synonym for&#13;
&#13;
 approval.    That's very good, but we believe that given the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion around the table, "endorsement" might be the&#13;
&#13;
 wrong word.    At least we should reconsider the term and&#13;
&#13;
 the concept behind it.&#13;
&#13;
             The deeper issue is probably the issue of&#13;
&#13;
 letting go, and we seem to have a little bit of a problem&#13;
&#13;
 of letting go.    Letting go is very hard, but as I said,&#13;
&#13;
 it's at the heart of the new process, and this is true for&#13;
&#13;
 the staff, for management, and for the Boards.      In that&#13;
&#13;
 sense, we have great sympathy for the proposal by Lewis&#13;
&#13;
 Holden, which I believe is a three-fold proposal for the&#13;
&#13;
 Boards to take note of the PRSPs, to assess the quality of&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSPs as basis for our lending, and then, thirdly, to&#13;
&#13;
 endorse the CAS.    I hope I represent that correctly, but&#13;
&#13;
 we believe that would be a sensible way to proceed.&#13;
&#13;
             The second comment on the CDF-PRSP relationship,&#13;
&#13;
 there was a bit of discussion on this last week.     We&#13;
&#13;
 appreciate very much the clarification offered by you,&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, and others, and we believe those explanations&#13;
&#13;
 are quite clear and the relationship is quite clear.      And&#13;
&#13;
 we're happy to see both initiatives' progress&#13;
                                                                 Page95&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 simultaneously, as we believe those initiatives are, in&#13;
&#13;
 fact, complementary.&#13;
&#13;
             The third comment is just to support, or&#13;
&#13;
 reiterate and support the request by the UK, the U.S. and&#13;
&#13;
 France today in this meeting for a timetable to be&#13;
&#13;
 published by Bank and Fund of HIPCs likely to come to the&#13;
&#13;
 Board before the spring meetings.        And if I may, I'd like&#13;
&#13;
 to diplomatically ask management for a response to that&#13;
&#13;
 request during this meeting.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:    You'll get a response.    Thank&#13;
&#13;
 you.&#13;
&#13;
             Khalid, please.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. AL-SAAD:   Thank you, Chairman.     I'm not sure&#13;
&#13;
 whether we're providing guidance or providing confusion to&#13;
&#13;
 the staff on this exercise.      You know, the issues are&#13;
&#13;
 complex and it's not easy, and we might want to go forward&#13;
&#13;
 with this exercise but with caution and to overburden poor&#13;
&#13;
 countries with many processes that fall beyond their&#13;
&#13;
 capacity.&#13;
&#13;
             As the paper notes, this process is learning by&#13;
&#13;
 doing, and during our Wednesday discussion one speaker&#13;
&#13;
 said he would prefer learning before doing.         But I'm not&#13;
                                                                    Page96&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 sure here whether we can learn before we do in this&#13;
&#13;
 exercise.&#13;
&#13;
             But the question that I have--I don't mind&#13;
&#13;
 learning by doing, but learning by whose money?     Is it the&#13;
&#13;
 poor countries' money or the Bank or donors' money?      So&#13;
&#13;
 that's why it's not clear to me whether we are learning&#13;
&#13;
 with poor country money in order to help them alleviate&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.&#13;
&#13;
             I don't have very much to say to what I said on&#13;
&#13;
 Wednesday regarding the paper, maybe one or two points.&#13;
&#13;
 Basically, it seems clear after our discussion of the&#13;
&#13;
 other two papers that there is a close link between the&#13;
&#13;
 operational issues, the guidelines, and the modalities&#13;
&#13;
 aspect.&#13;
&#13;
             It also seems clear, as many colleagues have&#13;
&#13;
 said, that we need to come back to this issue for a much&#13;
&#13;
 more careful look than the short notice allowed us during&#13;
&#13;
 this week.    The strategies proposed have far-reaching&#13;
&#13;
 implications for many countries well beyond the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 countries.    This became more evident when we discussed the&#13;
&#13;
 Internal Guidance Note, as we noted that the PRSP will, in&#13;
&#13;
 fact, be expected to be eventually prepared for over 70&#13;
&#13;
 countries.&#13;
                                                                 Page97&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           This involves a more complex process of more&#13;
&#13;
 papers, more staff missions, and clear linkage with CDF,&#13;
&#13;
 culminating finally in more costs for the institution and&#13;
&#13;
 the low-income borrowing countries they are trying to&#13;
&#13;
 help.   Of course, there is the positive outcome that is&#13;
&#13;
 expected from more focus on poverty reduction, but we need&#13;
&#13;
 to avoid the new burden and complexity involved.&#13;
&#13;
           What also became clear from our discussion of&#13;
&#13;
 the modalities for implementation is that the funding of&#13;
&#13;
 the strategy is far from certain.       The concern here is&#13;
&#13;
 that many countries might embark on the new, costly and&#13;
&#13;
 complex exercise without firm assurance that the needed&#13;
&#13;
 financing contribution will be secured.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, I wish to reiterate the concern I&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned last week on management's intention to cover the&#13;
&#13;
 additional resources by redeployment.         Despite staff&#13;
&#13;
 assurances, I hope this will not turn out to be another&#13;
&#13;
 unfunded mandate, and I share what Pieter Stek said in his&#13;
&#13;
 written statement.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
            MR. TOURE:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Most of my&#13;
&#13;
 points were already made during the informal briefings&#13;
&#13;
 that preceded today's meeting.        At this stage, I will try&#13;
&#13;
 to be very brief.    I have two or three points.&#13;
&#13;
            First, on the country ownership, I welcome the&#13;
&#13;
 qualitative move by the Development and Interim&#13;
&#13;
 Committees, and which are stressed in the papers before&#13;
&#13;
 us, to put countries in the driver's seat of the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 process.   In fact, as frequently advocated by this Chair,&#13;
&#13;
 there is no other alternative to that move which can&#13;
&#13;
 warrant success to development strategies.&#13;
&#13;
            My plea here would consist only in having the&#13;
&#13;
 following concern in mind as we are preparing to adopt&#13;
&#13;
 this approach.   First, the time issue and the related need&#13;
&#13;
 to be flexible in linking the PRSP to the HIPC support;&#13;
&#13;
 second, the issue of administrative and financial&#13;
&#13;
 resources needed to engage and complete quality PRSPs.       In&#13;
&#13;
 that regard, let me reiterate my suggestion to have a&#13;
&#13;
 second look at the issue of resources of the Africa&#13;
&#13;
 Region.    It is my view that this region needs additional&#13;
&#13;
 resources to carry out its duties in our countries under&#13;
&#13;
 the proposed approach.      The third issue is one of&#13;
                                                                   Page99&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 capacity-building in countries where that is needed to&#13;
&#13;
 fully own the process of the preparation of the PRSPs.&#13;
&#13;
           My second point is on the CAS and the PRSPs.&#13;
&#13;
 The CAS is a Bank document and therefore cannot be merged&#13;
&#13;
 with the PRSP.   In fact, if we see the PRSP as a&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive framework in which the development and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction priorities and strategies would be&#13;
&#13;
 crafted and implemented, I see no reason why it should be&#13;
&#13;
 different from the CAS chapter on government strategies.&#13;
&#13;
 Furthermore, I just cannot imagine our authorities&#13;
&#13;
 launching two different consultation processes nationwide&#13;
&#13;
 for the purpose of the preparation of PRSPs, on the one&#13;
&#13;
 hand, and the CASs on the other hand.&#13;
&#13;
           In short, we see room for finding a way to&#13;
&#13;
 rationalize the many papers that exist today, and most&#13;
&#13;
 importantly to also establish an operational link with the&#13;
&#13;
 CDF.   I think that we can easily merge these two papers.&#13;
&#13;
           Third, on the endorsement of the PRSPs, we see&#13;
&#13;
 the endorsement of PRSPs the same way as Pieter Stek put&#13;
&#13;
 it in his written statement, for example, for the support&#13;
&#13;
 that we will decide to provide.                              Page100&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, as regards the three options relating&#13;
&#13;
 to HIPC, our preference goes to Option 2, complemented by&#13;
&#13;
 Option 3 and the instances described in that option.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Franco Passacantando, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PASSACANTANDO:     Thank you.        I like the tone&#13;
&#13;
 of this document and the emphasis on the realism about&#13;
&#13;
 what can be achieved, which is the most important thing to&#13;
&#13;
 be reminded at this stage, I think, because we have to be&#13;
&#13;
 aware of not raising excessive expectations, you know, on&#13;
&#13;
 simply what is a new document and a new procedure, and&#13;
&#13;
 also the flexibility and the multiplicity of approaches&#13;
&#13;
 that should be followed to poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that many of the issues that have been&#13;
&#13;
 addressed in this document have been discussed not only in&#13;
&#13;
 the past days, but in recent years.        So I don't think we&#13;
&#13;
 have to once again state our position on what we mean by&#13;
&#13;
 ownership and participation.      But, you know, since we are&#13;
&#13;
 here, I think I'll do it again, trying to be as brief as&#13;
&#13;
 possible, and to refer specifically to the issue that is&#13;
&#13;
 at stake now.&#13;
                                                                      Page101&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           On the participatory process, I think that&#13;
&#13;
 Pieter Stek phrased it in a very good way that&#13;
&#13;
 participation can be an end in itself, and should be&#13;
&#13;
 therefore systematically encouraged by the Bank.            At the&#13;
&#13;
 same time, we all agree now that there is not an optimum&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process that can be applied to any&#13;
&#13;
 circumstance, so we should look with some humility and&#13;
&#13;
 open mind to the participatory process that each country&#13;
&#13;
 decides to adopt.&#13;
&#13;
           In this respect, the staff should refrain from&#13;
&#13;
 expressing a judgment, but it should provide the Board&#13;
&#13;
 with full and clear information in order for the Board to&#13;
&#13;
 make an informed judgment on this issue.             And on this&#13;
&#13;
 aspect, I think if we can be very specific, and more&#13;
&#13;
 specific from what we have been in the past about the&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process, I think that could be very helpful.&#13;
&#13;
           On ownership, I think that in recent months we&#13;
&#13;
 have made progress in defining what we mean by ownership.&#13;
&#13;
 And also we now recognize that there will always be a&#13;
&#13;
 tension when we discuss this concept, some tension that is&#13;
&#13;
 inevitable and perhaps welcome.         It's clear that ownership&#13;
&#13;
 means, I think, like Luc said, that a country should take&#13;
                                                                      Page102&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 full responsibility for its actions, and that is crucial&#13;
&#13;
 for the success of any development strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           It does not mean that it should not take into&#13;
&#13;
 account the knowledge and the experience of the&#13;
&#13;
 international community.    We also agree on that now, and&#13;
&#13;
 we also agree, but it is more controversial, that it does&#13;
&#13;
 not mean that the country should not refrain from taking&#13;
&#13;
 advantage from the pressure that the international&#13;
&#13;
 community could exert to implement reforms that are widely&#13;
&#13;
 recognized as being needed but that meet internal&#13;
&#13;
 resistance.&#13;
&#13;
           So it is a matter of balance, it is a matter of&#13;
&#13;
 judgment, and it is a matter of implementation.        And I&#13;
&#13;
 think the most important fact is how the Bank keeps itself&#13;
&#13;
 to have the ability and the sensitivity of presenting its&#13;
&#13;
 knowledge and its experience, and at the same time&#13;
&#13;
 listening to what the specific conditions of a country&#13;
&#13;
 are.   Let me state in this respect the importance that we&#13;
&#13;
 attach to the public expenditure reviews that are an&#13;
&#13;
 important technical instrument that the Bank can provide&#13;
&#13;
 to improve the overall strategy of poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me mention now two other aspects, the point&#13;
                                                                    Page103&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 of endorsement and the link with HIPC.         On endorsement, I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 think that I agree with others that endorsement should not&#13;
&#13;
 mean formal approval.     However, I do not share the opinion&#13;
&#13;
 of those who think that endorsement is inconsistent with&#13;
&#13;
 country ownership.    In fact, I think that a full and open&#13;
&#13;
 discussion on this Board of the PRSP could be beneficial&#13;
&#13;
 for the quality of the product and could avoid the risk&#13;
&#13;
 that Luc appropriately mentioned that the PRSP becomes&#13;
&#13;
 another bureaucratic process, like a document that the PFP&#13;
&#13;
 that ends up being not greatly used.&#13;
&#13;
             Again, also in this respect it is important that&#13;
&#13;
 the Board itself develop a new approach in discussing this&#13;
&#13;
 issue to avoid the risk of a bureaucratic approach.          But I&#13;
&#13;
 think that the Board should be involved in the discussion&#13;
&#13;
 of the PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, the link with HIPC.        We are in favor of&#13;
&#13;
 Option 2.    For retroactive countries, I'm sure that,&#13;
&#13;
 again, a proper balance can be found between the need to&#13;
&#13;
 proceed expeditiously and the opportunity that the new&#13;
&#13;
 emphasis on poverty reduction can offer to these countries&#13;
&#13;
 to improve and to fine-tune their own poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.    So I think on this again there is a judgment,&#13;
&#13;
 and I think that by working within Option 2 we can achieve&#13;
                                                                      Page104&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 this balance.&#13;

&#13;
           Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much, Franco.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Abraham, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. ABRAHAM:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   I have&#13;
&#13;
 circulated my statement, and therefore I will be brief&#13;
&#13;
 just to say, Mr. Chairman, that the issues of ownership&#13;
&#13;
 and endorsement, as explained and presented by management,&#13;
&#13;
 was well with us because as long as endorsement does not&#13;
&#13;
 mean that the Boards have the power to reject the poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy of countries, but like Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Passacantando said that they have a very positive input&#13;
&#13;
 into them, I think that's very, very positive.&#13;
&#13;
           In terms of ownership, Mr. Passacantando also&#13;
&#13;
 explained very well.     I don't think ownership from our&#13;
&#13;
 part means that exclusively these countries will not&#13;
&#13;
 entertain or benefit from the expertise of the&#13;
&#13;
 international community.    It should not mean that.     What&#13;
&#13;
 it should not mean is that the countries have very little&#13;
&#13;
 to do with that strategy and it comes here and is&#13;
&#13;
 approved, and therefore in the end we don't get the&#13;
&#13;
 results that we're after.     So I think I am, from my&#13;
&#13;
 viewpoint, quite happy today with the clarifications on&#13;
                                                                 Page105&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 endorsement and ownership.&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           The other issue is the good policy kind of&#13;
&#13;
 thing.   I very much endorse what Pieter Stek and Stephen&#13;
&#13;
 Pickford have stated in the sense that we should recognize&#13;
&#13;
 those countries that are really performing well.         I always&#13;
&#13;
 think of myself the classroom example that if you give&#13;
&#13;
 every student a C, regardless of that performance, that's&#13;
&#13;
 not a good policy.    Or if you give every student an A, it&#13;
&#13;
 doesn't make sense either.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we ought to recognize policy, whether&#13;
&#13;
 it's in lending, whether it's in peace policy.         In&#13;
&#13;
 everything that we do, we should not treat countries the&#13;
&#13;
 same, and I think our weakness has been that we treat them&#13;
&#13;
 fairly the same.   I'd like to state that.&#13;
&#13;
           And then a point, why we chose Option 2.          Option&#13;
&#13;
 2 simply does not shut the door on other countries who may&#13;
&#13;
 have the same problems of debt burden right now.         Option 3&#13;
&#13;
 simply excludes those.     So I think Option 2, with some&#13;
&#13;
 modification to include countries, meaning part of Option&#13;
&#13;
 3, is something that we would support.          And that goes very&#13;
&#13;
 well with our African Chair and the French Chair, and I&#13;
&#13;
 think we would be not totally fair to say those who have&#13;
&#13;
 made it so far, that's it, and we shut the door.&#13;
                                                                      Page106&#13;

           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Are there any other comments at this point?        Jan&#13;
&#13;
 is hesitating.   Her arm went up.&#13;
&#13;
           Jan?&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:   Some of the interventions raised&#13;
&#13;
 some legal questions, and I wonder if at some point in the&#13;
&#13;
 staff comment they might--I'm not sure if I--I was trying&#13;
&#13;
 to sort of frame those questions in my own mind, but I'm&#13;
&#13;
 not sure I could do so with precision.         But I think that&#13;
&#13;
 is an area that would be worth getting some enlightenment&#13;
&#13;
 on in the response.&#13;
&#13;
           And an area that we didn't so much in the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion today touch on but some of the written&#13;
&#13;
 statements did has to do with the role of WBI, and I think&#13;
&#13;
 that that is something that since not much has been said&#13;
&#13;
 about it, and given the hour, let's just perhaps say I&#13;
&#13;
 think that is something we should flag and probably will&#13;
&#13;
 return to in certain committee discussions because I think&#13;
&#13;
 that is an issue that is linked to resources and linked to&#13;
&#13;
 where responsibility resides.      And in our statement, we&#13;
&#13;
 did ask the question that we would appreciate an answer to&#13;
&#13;
 with respect to where responsibility will reside in the&#13;
                                                                    Page107&#13;

             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Matthias, please.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. MEYER:   I'm sorry.     I just forgot one very&#13;
&#13;
 practical aspect which I'd like to submit, since this&#13;
&#13;
 question of endorsement or how the Board deals with PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 is pretty much at the center of the debate.          One&#13;
&#13;
 possibility would be to have a summary of the Board's&#13;
&#13;
 discussion and consensus on PRSP made public the same way&#13;
&#13;
 as the PRSP and put it on the Web site, put it on the&#13;
&#13;
 Internet.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Other thoughts?&#13;
&#13;
             [No response.]&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:    Masood, will you organize, start&#13;
&#13;
 the response?&#13;
&#13;
             MR. AHMED:   Thank you, Sven.       I think perhaps&#13;
&#13;
 the way to take this is there is a set of specific&#13;
&#13;
 questions on the paper which I'd like to get Ann to pick&#13;
&#13;
 up on.&#13;
&#13;
             There were a couple of questions about the&#13;
&#13;
 redeployment.    Is it going to be within-region, across&#13;
                                                                   Page108&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 regions, how are we going to manage that?           Can we come&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 back and have some discussion of it?        And I was hoping&#13;
&#13;
 that Joanne would be able to come and talk about that, and&#13;
&#13;
 also about the specific question that was raised by, I&#13;
&#13;
 believe it was Mr. Alyahya about do we preclude adjustment&#13;
&#13;
 lending in the base case.     So we'll come back to that&#13;
&#13;
 question, as well.&#13;
&#13;
           Then I think given the time, I would suggest&#13;
&#13;
 that we leave aside a set of issues, but happy to come&#13;
&#13;
 back to them indeed even now, which relate to more&#13;
&#13;
 information on what the substantive content might be, how&#13;
&#13;
 to do beyond what is in Box 3, the work that is underway&#13;
&#13;
 on tool kits that is essentially trying to flesh that out.&#13;
&#13;
           And I had suggested in the meeting, I believe,&#13;
&#13;
 on Thursday that in January, when we had the first cut of&#13;
&#13;
 those tool kits, we would be happy to organize a workshop&#13;
&#13;
 and anybody who is interested, you know, is more than&#13;
&#13;
 welcome to participate in that.       So my sense is that we&#13;
&#13;
 take note of all of those issues.       They are important&#13;
&#13;
 points, and unless people want to discuss them now,&#13;
&#13;
 including the link between growth and poverty reduction,&#13;
&#13;
 we'll come back to that.&#13;
&#13;
           And that is also linked to the question of the&#13;
                                                                Page109&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 role of WBI in terms of the whole effort of how do we take&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 those tool kits and what do we do with them.       Let's come&#13;
&#13;
 back to that later.   Similarly, I think there is a set of&#13;
&#13;
 questions about what more can we say about the&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process in terms of how can we structure it.&#13;
&#13;
 I think Mr. Wolfensohn gave what, in a sense, is our&#13;
&#13;
 current thinking on it.    We have to develop it case by&#13;
&#13;
 case.&#13;
&#13;
           There is Box 4 which lays out some questions&#13;
&#13;
 that might be considered in reviewing that.        I think what&#13;
&#13;
 Ann mentioned in her opening statement was that we are&#13;
&#13;
 proposing that the staff assessment would do a little more&#13;
&#13;
 structured discussion of the participatory process using&#13;
&#13;
 those questions, and those questions themselves will&#13;
&#13;
 evolve and be refined as we move forward.&#13;
&#13;
           So I take on board the different views, some&#13;
&#13;
 suggesting that we might go a bit further still, others&#13;
&#13;
 cautious about whether even that is too far, and we'll try&#13;
&#13;
 that out in the first few cases.       And, again, we're happy&#13;
&#13;
 to come back to it if people want to have more of a&#13;
&#13;
 discussion.&#13;
&#13;
           And then what I'd like to perhaps come back to,&#13;
&#13;
 which is really the issue that I think we need to spend a&#13;
                                                                   Page110&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 bit of time on, is the question of how we are going to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 move forward now on this link in terms of what does&#13;
&#13;
 endorsement mean, how do we link it to the lending&#13;
&#13;
 strategies, because that is clearly the issue on which we&#13;
&#13;
 do need to spend a few minutes trying to get clarity.&#13;
&#13;
             And I'll then also clarify that I think on the&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC timetable, Ann mentioned the state of our current&#13;
&#13;
 thinking on it in her introductory comments, and our&#13;
&#13;
 intention is to reflect that both in the summing-up and&#13;
&#13;
 once these documents are put out, subject to the Fund&#13;
&#13;
 Board's agreement tomorrow, onto the Web, at the same time&#13;
&#13;
 to issue a press brief which would have that information&#13;
&#13;
 in it.   But we'd be happy to provide more information on&#13;
&#13;
 that.&#13;
&#13;
             So let me turn to Ann first and then ask Joanne&#13;
&#13;
 to pick up, and then we'll come back to the question of&#13;
&#13;
 what does endorsement and linkage with lending mean.&#13;
&#13;
             MS. DUNCAN:   Thank you, Masood.        Well, as Masood&#13;
&#13;
 has indicated, there have been a lot of different comments&#13;
&#13;
 on the question of endorsement which I think we'll come&#13;
&#13;
 back to.&#13;
&#13;
             There were a number of suggestions that the&#13;
&#13;
 question of ownership should not be cosmetic or an optical&#13;
                                                                       Page111&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 illusion.    I think that is well-recognized in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 principles of the paper.      I think a lot of this will be--&#13;
&#13;
 the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, and it&#13;
&#13;
 will be a question of how we help the countries with the&#13;
&#13;
 early cases and a lot of it will be based on the behavior&#13;
&#13;
 of Bank and Fund staff.      So I hope that that cultural&#13;
&#13;
 shift will actually take place throughout the&#13;
&#13;
 organization.&#13;
&#13;
           Another question was on whether Bank and Fund&#13;
&#13;
 missions to support the PRSP would be separate from&#13;
&#13;
 lending missions.    I believe that is the intention that&#13;
&#13;
 they should be separated in terms of time, but obviously&#13;
&#13;
 not in terms of content.&#13;
&#13;
           There was another question about the governments&#13;
&#13;
 being fully involved at all stages and what is the process&#13;
&#13;
 being followed so far.      A number of cases we have before&#13;
&#13;
 us--Bolivia and Uganda, for example--in Uganda, as many of&#13;
&#13;
 you probably know, this was very much a government-owned&#13;
&#13;
 process from the beginning.       In Bolivia, similarly the&#13;
&#13;
 government has been involved from a very early stage.         So&#13;
&#13;
 I think we would like to use those models and have the&#13;
&#13;
 government fully involved at all stages and, in fact, not&#13;
&#13;
 proceed until the government is clearly committed to&#13;
                                                                    Page112&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 proceeding and take the lead there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            There were a few questions on how to judge the&#13;
&#13;
 participatory approach and process.         I think Masood has&#13;
&#13;
 touched on that.   We'll come back to that in the early&#13;
&#13;
 cases.   As somebody pointed out, a lot of the judgments&#13;
&#13;
 we'll have to make on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
&#13;
            On the list of which of the countries we'll be&#13;
&#13;
 considering in addition to those mentioned, I think Axel&#13;
&#13;
 may want to take up the question of the countries to be&#13;
&#13;
 considered under the HIPC Initiative.&#13;
&#13;
            On the question of how firm would be the&#13;
&#13;
 commitment of the external partners, what if they get&#13;
&#13;
 involved to influence the PRSP but don't then come through&#13;
&#13;
 in terms of financial commitment, I think it would be hard&#13;
&#13;
 for us to make a determination on that.             I think it would&#13;
&#13;
 just be a question of the partners taking the full&#13;
&#13;
 responsibility when they do participate and coming&#13;
&#13;
 through.   And if they don't intend to come through with&#13;
&#13;
 support, then perhaps sitting back and letting others be&#13;
&#13;
 more involved.&#13;
&#13;
            On the question of the interim PRSP and at what&#13;
&#13;
 point would we, quote, "exit" from the interim PRSP and&#13;
&#13;
 into the full PRSP, I think the interim PRSP is seen very&#13;
                                                                        Page113&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 much as the first stage for any country as the launch of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the process.   So, by definition, there would only be one&#13;
&#13;
 interim PRSP, and thereafter we would expect to see a&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that is based on the recognition that&#13;
&#13;
 each country will be starting from a different starting&#13;
&#13;
 point.   And so one would actually expect to see progress&#13;
&#13;
 over the years.   By year one, one would expect to see a&#13;
&#13;
 certain amount of progress in key dimensions, and I think&#13;
&#13;
 those dimensions would be, first of all, the diagnostics&#13;
&#13;
 and analysis of poverty; second, the government getting&#13;
&#13;
 together a shared vision in the society of what the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction objectives are.       Obviously,&#13;
&#13;
 participation will be key to that process.&#13;
&#13;
           The third key dimension would be linking the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty outcomes with priority public actions in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 action implementation and really focus on those things&#13;
&#13;
 that are going to make a big difference to the lives of&#13;
&#13;
 the poor, and finally making sure that the implementation&#13;
&#13;
 of the strategy is monitored in an open, transparent and&#13;
&#13;
 participatory way with the key stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
           So I think the vision is to expect that&#13;
&#13;
 countries will make progress on each of those dimensions&#13;
                                                             Page114&#13;

&#13;
 "perfect PRSP" overnight or between the interim PRSP and&#13;
&#13;
 the PRSP, but rather a continual progression on key&#13;
&#13;
 dimensions.&#13;
&#13;
           Those are the questions I had from the paper.&#13;
&#13;
 Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. SALOP:     Good afternoon.       Three questions I'm&#13;
&#13;
 going to address.    One is the budget issues that several&#13;
&#13;
 speakers raised; two, the adjustment links that Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Alyahya raised; and then, three, CAS links with PRSP which&#13;
&#13;
 a number of speakers raised.&#13;
&#13;
           First, on the budget issues, as you saw in the&#13;
&#13;
 Internal Guidance Note, we have done some analysis of what&#13;
&#13;
 the incremental budget costs are to the Bank of rolling&#13;
&#13;
 out the PRSP process.      And as you know, we came forward&#13;
&#13;
 with the idea that we would not ask for a supplementary&#13;
&#13;
 appropriation at this time, but rather try to meet the&#13;
&#13;
 expenses with respect to redeployment from within.&#13;
&#13;
           That said, we are keeping a very close watch on&#13;
&#13;
 the situation.   The message has gone out to the staff and&#13;
&#13;
 to the country directors in the countries, particularly in&#13;
&#13;
 the Africa Region, that the incremental funding, should it&#13;
&#13;
 be needed, is there.     In the first instance, we have&#13;
                                                                      Page115&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 talked to the teams about their redeploying within&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 programs to the extent that is necessary; secondly, within&#13;
&#13;
 the region to the extent that that is appropriate; and&#13;
&#13;
 then, third, within the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           Shengman Zhang is overall looking at the&#13;
&#13;
 resource picture, and we have this amount of redeployed&#13;
&#13;
 resources which we can then channel back to the country&#13;
&#13;
 teams or the regions should that prove necessary.    So we&#13;
&#13;
 do want to assure you that we are keeping a very close&#13;
&#13;
 watch on it, particularly for the Africa Region, as&#13;
&#13;
 Messrs. Toure and Hubloue have raised those particular&#13;
&#13;
 points.&#13;
&#13;
           For next year, we're also looking, and as Sven&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned the other day and as was mentioned this morning,&#13;
&#13;
 we will be looking at that picture very closely in the&#13;
&#13;
 context of the budget discussions for FY01 and the&#13;
&#13;
 Strategic Directions.&#13;
&#13;
           Now, in terms of this year, just one very quick&#13;
&#13;
 word on that.   Clearly, there are going to be incremental&#13;
&#13;
 costs in the PRSP program.     The question that we face,&#13;
&#13;
 though, is in some sense the adding-up question.     While we&#13;
&#13;
 can put together the incremental costs and give funding&#13;
&#13;
 for those programs, at the end of the day we're also going&#13;
                                                                 Page116&#13;

&#13;
 the work underlying those programs.&#13;

           What we're not totally sure is how much on the&#13;
&#13;
 incremental staff side we can pull into the programs&#13;
&#13;
 within the year.   That lies behind the question of the&#13;
&#13;
 softness in the budgetary forecasts for this year.         If we&#13;
&#13;
 are successful in pulling in incremental staff and&#13;
&#13;
 resources, say, from short-term consultants to do the&#13;
&#13;
 work, the overall costs of the program will end up being&#13;
&#13;
 higher.   We'll have less net redeployment.         If it's lower,&#13;
&#13;
 we will end up redeploying more within the program.&#13;
&#13;
           So as I say, we're keeping a very close watch on&#13;
&#13;
 this situation both on the resource side and the overall&#13;
&#13;
 staff side.   The staffing side is being managed through&#13;
&#13;
 the network, through the PREM network, who is, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 managing the substantive work on the program overall.         So&#13;
&#13;
 that is on the budget.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, on the question of the adjustment&#13;
&#13;
 lending that Mr. Alyahya raised and whether, in fact--in&#13;
&#13;
 the paper, particularly in the Internal Guidance Note,&#13;
&#13;
 we've indicated that PRSP would be a necessary condition&#13;
&#13;
 for high-case lending and for adjustment lending within&#13;
                                                                      Page117&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 the base case.   And I think the question was specifically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 with respect to the adjustment in the base case, and he&#13;
&#13;
 referred to a note that we put out last week on adjustment&#13;
&#13;
 lending and the Bank policy and practice with respect to&#13;
&#13;
 consulting with the IMF in the context of adjustment&#13;
&#13;
 lending.   And it's exactly that point which is relevant&#13;
&#13;
 here.&#13;
&#13;
            Here, our thinking was the following, and that&#13;
&#13;
 is for a country which is already in the PRSP program, if&#13;
&#13;
 there is not a PRSP in place, a satisfactory&#13;
&#13;
 implementation in place, then it has two possible reasons.&#13;
&#13;
 One, either the macro is off track, in which case per the&#13;
&#13;
 note we put out we would typically not be going ahead with&#13;
&#13;
 adjustment lending.   Or, alternatively, the Bank-supported&#13;
&#13;
 program is not on track.    In that case, as well, we&#13;
&#13;
 typically would not be going forward with adjustment&#13;
&#13;
 lending.&#13;
&#13;
            So from both sides of the house, we came to the&#13;
&#13;
 conclusion that within the base case we would not be doing&#13;
&#13;
 adjustment lending for countries who are otherwise&#13;
&#13;
 eligible for the PRSP program in the short run unless the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP is in place and on track.      So I hope you find that a&#13;
&#13;
 satisfactory explanation.     I'm happy to follow up in&#13;
                                                                 Page118&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 bilateral discussions.&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            The third point: Many speakers raised the&#13;
&#13;
 questions about the links between the CAS, the PRSP, and&#13;
&#13;
 the CDF.   Just very quickly, one word on that overall&#13;
&#13;
 architecture.   As some of you may have seen, but you may&#13;
&#13;
 not have seen, given the abundance of papers before you in&#13;
&#13;
 recent days and weeks, we were to have had a discussion&#13;
&#13;
 last Friday on the CAS retrospective, and          that paper&#13;
&#13;
 deals with many of these issues in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 relationship between the emerging PRSP process, the CDF&#13;
&#13;
 process, and the CAS process.&#13;
&#13;
            In terms of vision, I think what we very much&#13;
&#13;
 see is an interconnected process of these various papers.&#13;
&#13;
 And right now, what the CAS involves is basically three&#13;
&#13;
 main building blocks; one, a statement of the country&#13;
&#13;
 strategy and vision; two, a Bank assessment of the country&#13;
&#13;
 strategy and the constraints to development; and, three, a&#13;
&#13;
 statement of the Bank Group program, why it is the program&#13;
&#13;
 is what it is and what are the benchmarks by which&#13;
&#13;
 performance will be measured.&#13;
&#13;
            Essentially, what we have before us is an&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity to really unbundle, or as we have said in the&#13;
&#13;
 retrospective, unpack the CAS process, with the PRSP&#13;
                                                                 Page119&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 and/or CDF being really that first part of it standing on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 its own and very much clearly underpinned and led by the&#13;
&#13;
 country itself; the second piece, the staff assessment, in&#13;
&#13;
 this case being a joint Bank/Fund assessment; and then the&#13;
&#13;
 third piece which will be the kernel of what is now the&#13;
&#13;
 CAS, the Bank Group business strategy going forward.          And&#13;
&#13;
 several speakers this morning, I think, have used the&#13;
&#13;
 vocabulary there.&#13;
&#13;
           Now, while that is the vision of these three&#13;
&#13;
 pieces--and I think the vision is also one of an&#13;
&#13;
 integrated vision, and an integrated discussion of the&#13;
&#13;
 three of them at the same time would be the best--in the&#13;
&#13;
 near term we will also have transition issues with respect&#13;
&#13;
 to that, also with respect to timing.           And it may well be&#13;
&#13;
 that the PRSP time frame is driven by considerations with&#13;
&#13;
 respect to HIPC, with respect to the PRGF, and may not be&#13;
&#13;
 exactly on the same time frame as the Bank program.&#13;
&#13;
           So it's in that context that we were looking for&#13;
&#13;
 flexibility with respect to the timing of these various&#13;
&#13;
 components.   But certainly--and to my neighbor, Mr. Toure,&#13;
&#13;
 I would like to reassure him that our thinking is very&#13;
&#13;
 much the idea to try to harmonize the overall timing and&#13;
&#13;
 to reduce duplication and certainly to eliminate any&#13;
                                                                      Page120&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 sources of contradiction, so that in the end we would have&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 these three pieces which currently are bundled up in the&#13;
&#13;
 CAS to be much more separated, and also then to give&#13;
&#13;
 greater voice to the country, of course, in laying out the&#13;
&#13;
 country vision, aspirations, objectives, and strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much, Joanne.&#13;
&#13;
           Should we move on to the word "endorse" and&#13;
&#13;
 maybe hear first from Daoud.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. KHAIRALLAH:    It seems that this word has&#13;
&#13;
 given us a lot of difficulties, although management has&#13;
&#13;
 tried to explain by that we don't mean a formal legal&#13;
&#13;
 endorsement.   Notwithstanding that, difficulties persist.I&#13;
&#13;
 want to make it clear that neither the Bank nor the Board&#13;
&#13;
 has legal authority, standing, to endorse a document that&#13;
&#13;
 is issued and provided by a country.&#13;
&#13;
           What we mean by endorsement here--the word&#13;
&#13;
 "noted" was mentioned, which is a good contribution.       The&#13;
&#13;
 Board would note, would assess, would give input and&#13;
&#13;
 guidance, and basically would feel comfortable with this&#13;
&#13;
 strategy that would help the Board in taking whatever&#13;
&#13;
 decision with respect to a particular investment.&#13;
&#13;
           So the word "endorsement"--unfortunately, we&#13;
                                                                  Page121&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 couldn't find a better word that would engulf all this--is&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 not meant to mean more than the Board would feel&#13;
&#13;
 comfortable with a strategy adopted by a country.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Masood?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. AHMED:   I think that the way that Daoud has&#13;
&#13;
 laid it out is, in my mind, a sensible way to think about&#13;
&#13;
 it.   I don't think there's any real substantive&#13;
&#13;
 disagreement about what it is that we're trying to achieve&#13;
&#13;
 in the sense that I think the reason why the PRSP, which&#13;
&#13;
 is a country strategy document prepared by the country, is&#13;
&#13;
 being discussed by the Boards is because we are linking it&#13;
&#13;
 to the actions that the Bank will take.            It's a context&#13;
&#13;
 for the country assistance strategy and the lending&#13;
&#13;
 operational program contained therein for us.&#13;
&#13;
           And I think what we're struggling with is what's&#13;
&#13;
 the best way to characterize the two levels of engagement.&#13;
&#13;
 The reason why we're reviewing the PRSP is, as Daoud&#13;
&#13;
 pointed out, to take note of it, to provide feedback and&#13;
&#13;
 guidance, and to be comfortable that as a backdrop to what&#13;
&#13;
 we are going to be doing as a context for the Bank's own&#13;
&#13;
 subsequent actions, it provides a good way to go forward.&#13;
&#13;
           Then there is a more specific feedback in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of the links with the CAS.     I think that's the point that&#13;
                                                                     Page122&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Lewis was raising, also.    And there I think that there are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 two points, specific ones, that were raised.          In some&#13;
&#13;
 sense, is it necessary and sufficient to have a PRSP, to&#13;
&#13;
 have a high-case?    It's not just necessary and sufficient&#13;
&#13;
 to have a PRSP, but it's the content of the PRSP which&#13;
&#13;
 sets the framework.     And ultimately we come back to this&#13;
&#13;
 discussion of substance over process.           We are saying it is&#13;
&#13;
 necessary because in some sense we're trying to structure&#13;
&#13;
 that discussion, but not sufficient.&#13;
&#13;
           And, secondly, then the guidance that we would&#13;
&#13;
 get from the Board would then enable us to look at the&#13;
&#13;
 specific lending scenarios within the CAS and the overall&#13;
&#13;
 framework of the CAS.      So I think that's how we see it.&#13;
&#13;
 Now, the question really is how does one formulate it in a&#13;
&#13;
 way that gets to the heart of that two-level relationship.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it's difficult to find an alternative&#13;
&#13;
 term for "endorse."     Maybe "take note" is an option, but&#13;
&#13;
 in some ways it's more than just simply taking note of&#13;
&#13;
 what is in there.    It's actually saying that what is in&#13;
&#13;
 there is a satisfactory basis on which to provide a&#13;
&#13;
 context for our operations, and that's why we came up with&#13;
&#13;
 this term "endorse."     So we're struggling to see if we can&#13;
&#13;
 find a better term, but that is really what has driven us&#13;
                                                                       Page123&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 to where we are now.&#13;

&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:      Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Any further thoughts or should we see where we&#13;
&#13;
 come out?&#13;
&#13;
             Lewis Holden, please.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. HOLDEN:     I suppose the difficulty I still&#13;
&#13;
 have with that, though, is that it almost implies a binary&#13;
&#13;
 situation where we either are comfortable or not.            And it&#13;
&#13;
 seems to me that more often than not, there are going to&#13;
&#13;
 be aspects of the PRSP that we're comfortable with and&#13;
&#13;
 aspects that we're less comfortable with, and that will be&#13;
&#13;
 reflected in the type and the level of our engagement.            So&#13;
&#13;
 that is what I'm still a little bit uncomfortable with.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:      Further comments.&#13;
&#13;
             Please.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. ALYAHYA:     There are just two clarifications.&#13;
&#13;
 One is about having an annex or table showing the role of&#13;
&#13;
 donors in the preparation--or giving technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
 to the country in the preparation of that.             The other one&#13;
&#13;
 is right now in the CAS, if there is a major disagreement&#13;
&#13;
 between the government and the Bank, we allow them to put&#13;
&#13;
 detail on that, and whether if there is a major&#13;
&#13;
 disagreement or the staff assessment is negative, we&#13;
                                                                        Page124&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 should allow the country an opportunity to comment on the&#13;

                             507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

                               (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 staff assessment and therefore attach that for information&#13;
&#13;
 to the Board.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Luc, please.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. HUBLOUE:   Yes, Chairman.       I don't want to&#13;
&#13;
 prolong the discussion on this issue of terminology, but&#13;
&#13;
 if there is one thing I would like to caution against, it&#13;
&#13;
 is that the words just "take note of" would slip into the&#13;
&#13;
 whole approach of dealing with this because then I'm&#13;
&#13;
 afraid we are going to open the door to the PFP kind of&#13;
&#13;
 approach.    They are also distributed for us to take note&#13;
&#13;
 of and that is what we do with them.&#13;
&#13;
             The other thing is I think we don't have to have&#13;
&#13;
 illusions about all that.      I'm perfectly happy to live&#13;
&#13;
 with another word than "endorse," but if we are not going&#13;
&#13;
 to endorse it, someone else is going to do it for us.             And&#13;
&#13;
 that is probably going to be management when it enters&#13;
&#13;
 into the final discussion with the government on how it&#13;
&#13;
 feels that really the final product should look like&#13;
&#13;
 before it is ready for being a basis for Bank lending.&#13;
&#13;
             So, you know, we may be perfectly happy to live&#13;
&#13;
 with that situation, but I'm not necessarily sure that it&#13;
                                                                         Page125&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 is the most transparent one.       So I think the discussion&#13;
&#13;
 should continue to be very open on that.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you, Luc.&#13;

            MR. PICKFORD:    I can't think of one, but then&#13;
&#13;
 I'm not sure we ought to spend that much more time trying&#13;
&#13;
 to find a better word.&#13;
&#13;
            I think the discussion has actually brought out&#13;
&#13;
 some quite useful aspects; I think the concept of a&#13;
&#13;
 spectrum that Lewis introduced, although it will be multi-&#13;
&#13;
 dimensional.   The idea of building a degree of comfort is&#13;
&#13;
 also a useful one.&#13;
&#13;
            Like Luc, I think "take note" is probably too&#13;
&#13;
 passive and doesn't really reflect the richness.      I think&#13;
&#13;
 it is also worth injecting the sense that there is--while&#13;
&#13;
 it's not formal approval, nevertheless the degree of&#13;
&#13;
 comfort derived from the PRSP, about the PRSP, will&#13;
&#13;
 influence decisions about the degree of lending under&#13;
&#13;
 other programs.&#13;
&#13;
            And I suspect that all of those elements will be&#13;
&#13;
 always imperfectly couched in one word, but I can't think&#13;
                                                                 Page126&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 of a better one.   And as long as we know what we mean,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 then that is really all that matters.         I suspect also what&#13;
&#13;
 we mean by it will evolve as we get through the first few&#13;
&#13;
 cases and we'll decide whether the process is working or&#13;
&#13;
 not.&#13;
&#13;
            You know, we'll reach a degree of comfort about&#13;
&#13;
 the process, as well as about the PRSPs, I suspect.        And&#13;
&#13;
 one suggestion--I can't remember who made it--which I&#13;
&#13;
 think is useful is that we should really use the&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity of the discussion to producing a summing-up&#13;
&#13;
 that reflects the sort of comments and views and richness&#13;
&#13;
 of the discussion.      And I don't see any reason why that&#13;
&#13;
 shouldn't be publicly available as a commentary, if you&#13;
&#13;
 like, on the PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
            One way, I suspect, of avoiding or getting&#13;
&#13;
 around the problem that people feel about this is, as I&#13;
&#13;
 suggested, trying as hard as possible to harmonize the&#13;
&#13;
 timing of the discussion between, on the one hand, the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP which is country-driven, on the other hand the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 response to that, which is why what Joanne said was very&#13;
&#13;
 helpful.   And I think we should try hard to, if you like--&#13;
&#13;
 use another unfortunate word--we should collapse those&#13;
&#13;
 discussions.&#13;
                                                                     Page127&#13;

&#13;
           MR. AHMED:    Sorry, not to prolong it, but just&#13;
&#13;
 to make two points.    I think, one, to confirm that I think&#13;
&#13;
 the notion that the role that donors have played in&#13;
&#13;
 providing technical assistance and attaching that to the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP is certainly a very good idea, and we would certainly&#13;
&#13;
 be happy with that and encourage it.&#13;
&#13;
           Similarly, from our perspective, I don't think&#13;
&#13;
 we see any difficulty with the notion that if there is a&#13;
&#13;
 continuing disagreements about assessments or about&#13;
&#13;
 policies, then that should be flagged in the document, so&#13;
&#13;
 not an issue on that.&#13;
&#13;
           And, finally, just to make one point that I&#13;
&#13;
 think the valuable addition of the last few minutes in&#13;
&#13;
 helping to think this through is also not to think of it&#13;
&#13;
 as a binary process, but rather that, in a sense, the&#13;
&#13;
 guidance from the Boards would be very much also on areas&#13;
&#13;
 of weaknesses, the extent to which there was complete&#13;
&#13;
 endorsement of some issues that were still there.     And&#13;
&#13;
 that would then drive the nature and scope of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 assistance strategy as well.      So I think thinking of it as&#13;
&#13;
 a more graduated process certainly helps in doing that.&#13;
&#13;
           And just to close with the point that it's also&#13;
                                                                  Page128&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 important not to think of this as a "one of" process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 What we are saying is that this is an ongoing exercise&#13;
&#13;
 that the country is undertaking in which this kind of&#13;
&#13;
 feedback from the Boards on a particular iteration of a&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP is very useful input for them as they think about&#13;
&#13;
 where they go next in terms of issues.&#13;
&#13;
           So I don't necessarily see the PRSP discussion&#13;
&#13;
 by the Board as being the end of the exercise.     It's&#13;
&#13;
 really an important end point in a cycle, but it is a&#13;
&#13;
 continuing exercise in which the country will be embarked,&#13;
&#13;
 and successive iterations of PRSPs done by the country&#13;
&#13;
 would benefit from this and other discussions in other&#13;
&#13;
 institutions which would also be using that strategy as a&#13;
&#13;
 framework for their own actions.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Matthias?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. MEYER:   I mean, of course, I like this&#13;
&#13;
 discussion very much because we're trying to find a&#13;
&#13;
 practical way to determine what the Board should be doing,&#13;
&#13;
 and this is a general problem we have in the Board and I&#13;
&#13;
 hope we address that now through this new committee and&#13;
&#13;
 determine much better what do we really mean when we&#13;
&#13;
 discuss something and what is the output we expect and how&#13;
                                                              Page129&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 is this output being put into some form which represents a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 consensus.   I think we have not been very good at this in&#13;
&#13;
 many areas, and maybe if I might add that note, we have&#13;
&#13;
 not always maybe also been given the support by management&#13;
&#13;
 to reach very clear conclusions and consensus.&#13;
&#13;
           Now, here, I think we're being a little bit too&#13;
&#13;
 nice with each other this morning, in the sense that this&#13;
&#13;
 discussion on PRSP, although it is, of course, the basis&#13;
&#13;
 for a CAS and then it could lead to different lending&#13;
&#13;
 scenarios, and so on, it is also the basis for a decision&#13;
&#13;
 on whether a country is being included in HIPC or not.&#13;
&#13;
           In other words, it's a yes or no decision, and&#13;
&#13;
 once a country is included, this not only means that it&#13;
&#13;
 gets important financial support over a period of time,&#13;
&#13;
 but it also means that as the Initiative, as we know, is&#13;
&#13;
 not totally funded, it means probably that in each case,&#13;
&#13;
 at least after the first three or four cases, that there&#13;
&#13;
 is going to be a funding drive.       And we will have to&#13;
&#13;
 convince donors and the international community to fund&#13;
&#13;
 this program which is expressed in part through this PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
           So, you know, we do not have a gradual scenario&#13;
&#13;
 where we can agree or not agree, or agree on some aspects,&#13;
&#13;
 not agree on other aspects.     At the end, we have to&#13;
                                                              Page130&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 endorse the PRSP as the basis for very important support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 by the international community to a specific country.         And&#13;
&#13;
 so in that sense the significance of that endorsement&#13;
&#13;
 might be a little bit bigger than what some people would&#13;
&#13;
 like to have it.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Why don't I try the key paragraph in the&#13;
&#13;
 summing-up the way we have it now, and then later I'll com&#13;
&#13;
 back to the full summing-up.&#13;
&#13;
           Directors agreed that the PRSP would provide a&#13;
&#13;
 context for concessional lending to support countries and&#13;
&#13;
 for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.          They agreed&#13;
&#13;
 that while the Board would consider and comment on the&#13;
&#13;
 overall approach set out in the PRSP, it would endorse the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP and provide guidance to management insofar as the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP relates to the policies and programs within the areas&#13;
&#13;
 of the Bank's responsibility.       The PRSP and the Board's&#13;
&#13;
 guidance would then the guidance for the CAS and the CAS&#13;
&#13;
 lending scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
           So we've divided it into two parts.         First, the&#13;
&#13;
 Board would consider and comment on the overall approach.&#13;
&#13;
 Secondly, it would endorse the PRSP and provide guidance&#13;
&#13;
 to management insofar as the PRSP relates to the Bank's&#13;
                                                                     Page131&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 policies and programs.&#13;

&#13;
           Mr. Balduino?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. BALDUINO:    Yes, thank you very much.    I&#13;
&#13;
 think the language is very interesting, but the question&#13;
&#13;
 is whether we would not be freezing the fact that the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 and the consideration of the CAS would not be collapsible&#13;
&#13;
 because then we would be making really two--because I&#13;
&#13;
 think the intention is to make the two even come together,&#13;
&#13;
 so the CAS would--&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    No.    We would keep the two&#13;
&#13;
 distinct, but we would streamline them so they fit&#13;
&#13;
 together better than the CAS has related to other&#13;
&#13;
 documents in the past.&#13;
&#13;
           But on the endorsement, does it work?      Should we&#13;
&#13;
 simply move ahead on this basis?       We still have to listen&#13;
&#13;
 to the Fund Board tomorrow, and then over time we can&#13;
&#13;
 adjust this as we learn.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Singh?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SINGH:   This summary has a very fascinating&#13;
&#13;
 aspect.   Possibly for the first time, we have the&#13;
&#13;
 deliberations of the Board to be viewed in two parts.       One&#13;
&#13;
 is a part which deals statistically with national&#13;
&#13;
 governments, and the other is the part which will deal&#13;
                                                                   Page132&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 directly with the management.&#13;

&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           We largely function through the management, so&#13;
&#13;
 whatever we say or whatever we do not say are the&#13;
&#13;
 components of our directions or guidance to the&#13;
&#13;
 management.   Now, here one part is not meant for that.         So&#13;
&#13;
 what we are trying to endorse is endorse things which will&#13;
&#13;
 constitute guidance to the management.&#13;
&#13;
           The comments that we are making would constitute&#13;
&#13;
 something which is related to the national government.          I&#13;
&#13;
 think there is a dichotomy between the two.         So what I&#13;
&#13;
 will suggest, Mr. Chairman, is that if the draft summary&#13;
&#13;
 could be given to us for a look before you circulate it,&#13;
&#13;
 because this can be liable to interpretations and will put&#13;
&#13;
 the deliberations of the Board on totally a new path which&#13;
&#13;
 is not intended.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Okay.    We need to get this over&#13;
&#13;
 to the Fund by the end of the day, so we don't have much&#13;
&#13;
 time.&#13;
&#13;
           Any other thoughts?       I should read the whole&#13;
&#13;
 summing-up, also, but Stephen?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PICKFORD:     I'm still not all that&#13;
&#13;
 comfortable with this dichotomy which is actually rather&#13;
&#13;
 starker even than the paper itself between, on the one&#13;
                                                                      Page133&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 hand, commenting on the overall strategy and then&#13;
&#13;
 endorsing in the areas of the Bank's own responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
           I heard the discussion around the table.          I&#13;
&#13;
 don't think there's that very stark element here.          I mean,&#13;
&#13;
 realistically, the PRSP is one of the inputs into the&#13;
&#13;
 Board's judgments about lending operations, and indeed the&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC decisions.   And I don't think realistically we can&#13;
&#13;
 ignore, for instance, in this Board whether there is a&#13;
&#13;
 sound and sustainable macro framework in place.          So I&#13;
&#13;
 think the distinction in the wording is rather too stark.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:      Okay.    I think we're eating into&#13;
&#13;
 your lunch hour and several EDs have left.           What we may&#13;
&#13;
 want to do is take some time and work on the language,&#13;
&#13;
 come back to you, as Mr. Singh suggested, in the afternoon&#13;
&#13;
 and see if we can't reconcile these views.           And that would&#13;
&#13;
 also give us a chance to consult with the Fund colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
 So let's do that.    We'll try to do it within an hour or&#13;
&#13;
 two, depending on when we can get a hold of people.&#13;
&#13;
           But should I read the overall summing-up, also,&#13;
&#13;
 so you get that, and then we'll circulate the full piece.&#13;
&#13;
           First of all, this summing-up will try to&#13;
&#13;
 capture the main themes.      The richness of the discussion&#13;
                                                                       Page134&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 we'll capture separately and build on as we move forward,&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 but these are the main themes that are important also for&#13;
&#13;
 the Fund tomorrow.&#13;
&#13;
           First, Directors endorsed the overall approach&#13;
&#13;
 set out in the paper, and welcomed the progress made in&#13;
&#13;
 operationalizing the PRSP concept.        There was general&#13;
&#13;
 agreement with the principles underlying the PRSPs, namely&#13;
&#13;
 that they should be country-driven with broad&#13;
&#13;
 participation of civil society and development partners;&#13;
&#13;
 that they should reflect the country-specific nature and&#13;
&#13;
 determinants of poverty; and that they should be results-&#13;
&#13;
 oriented and link public actions to poverty outcomes,&#13;
&#13;
 especially through faster and broad-based growth.&#13;
&#13;
 Directors noted that these principles characterize the&#13;
&#13;
 Comprehensive Development Framework.&#13;
&#13;
           Directors emphasized that flexibility should be&#13;
&#13;
 built into the process to reflect diversity in country&#13;
&#13;
 context and capacity, and to develop and implement poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategies.    Many Directors stressed that this&#13;
&#13;
 approach would likely result in greater variation in both&#13;
&#13;
 substance and form across the future country programs&#13;
&#13;
 considered for support by the Bretton Woods institutions.&#13;
&#13;
           Directors stressed that many countries would&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 participatory strategies, and called for the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
 other bilateral and multilateral agencies to treat such&#13;
&#13;
 assistance as a matter of high priority.           They emphasized&#13;
&#13;
 the importance of countries reaching out early to other&#13;
&#13;
 development partners so that the PRSP initiative could&#13;
&#13;
 gain from their perspective and support at both the&#13;
&#13;
 country and agency level.&#13;
&#13;
           Most Directors agreed that the joint staff&#13;
&#13;
 assessment which would accompany the PRSP to the Boards&#13;
&#13;
 should focus on the evaluation of substantive policies and&#13;
&#13;
 only describe the participatory process used to define key&#13;
&#13;
 anti-poverty actions and monitoring procedures.&#13;
&#13;
           Some Directors, however, also recommended that&#13;
&#13;
 staff assessment should go a step further and give an&#13;
&#13;
 evaluation of the participatory process, or at least&#13;
&#13;
 provide a more structured description of the participatory&#13;
&#13;
 process that had been followed in each country case.&#13;
&#13;
           Then would follow the paragraph on endorsement&#13;
&#13;
 which I mentioned earlier which we will work on.&#13;
&#13;
           And then Directors stressed that to ensure&#13;
&#13;
 country ownership, poverty reduction strategies will take&#13;
&#13;
 time to establish.   They were also concerned, however,&#13;
                                                                      Page136&#13;

&#13;
 provision of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, and&#13;
&#13;
 welcomed the concept of interim PRSPs as a means of&#13;
&#13;
 avoiding such delays in the transition period.&#13;
&#13;
           With respect to retroactive cases under the&#13;
&#13;
 Enhanced HIPC Initiative, most Directors recommended that&#13;
&#13;
 the adoption of a participatory PRSP should be a&#13;
&#13;
 sufficient requirement for the completion point, subject&#13;
&#13;
 to progress in policies and poverty reduction measures.&#13;
&#13;
           Some Directors indicated that they support even&#13;
&#13;
 faster progress toward the provision of debt relief, and&#13;
&#13;
 asked that the period between decision and completion&#13;
&#13;
 points for these countries be kept relatively short or&#13;
&#13;
 collapsed altogether.&#13;
&#13;
           Directors took note of the expected timetable&#13;
&#13;
 for processing HIPC cases in the coming months.&#13;
&#13;
 Specifically, they welcomed that under current plans and&#13;
&#13;
 subject to country progress, it was expected that three&#13;
&#13;
 countries would reach their decision points in January--&#13;
&#13;
 Bolivia, Mauritania and Uganda--with Mozambique following&#13;
&#13;
 shortly thereafter.   It was further expected that four&#13;
&#13;
 additional countries would reach their decision points in&#13;
&#13;
 the subsequent quarter.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            There was general agreement that the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 process would need careful review.        Directors welcomed the&#13;
&#13;
 proposal of a status report by the time of the spring&#13;
&#13;
 meetings, a progress report in the fall of 2000, and a&#13;
&#13;
 full review at the end of 2001.&#13;
&#13;
            Finally, Directors commended the staff of the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank and the Fund for their continued strong collaboration&#13;
&#13;
 on the PRSP exercise and for their work in preparing the&#13;
&#13;
 paper.   They agreed that, subject to the outcome of the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund Board discussion tomorrow, the joint paper and this&#13;
&#13;
 summing-up should be posted on the Bank's Web site as&#13;
&#13;
 drafts for consultation.&#13;
&#13;
            Hein, please.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. BOGAARD:    A very good summary, I think.    At&#13;
&#13;
 one point in the beginning of the summary, you put a lot&#13;
&#13;
 of emphasis on the demands about flexibility toward&#13;
&#13;
 countries.   Whereas we have not discussed the substance of&#13;
&#13;
 guidance yet, there was a clear call of a number of&#13;
&#13;
 Directors, I think, to put some more guidance in the&#13;
&#13;
 framework, in several boxes in the paper, for instance, in&#13;
&#13;
 the tool kits.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. SANDSTROM:   I think the views were quite&#13;
                                                                    Page138&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 diverse.   I thought there was quite a range of views&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 stressing the flexibility and diversity.            But we'll take&#13;
&#13;
 another look at the language.&#13;
&#13;
             I don't want to get into debate on each point.&#13;
&#13;
 We'll take your points and we'll then work on it.&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Haque?&#13;
&#13;
             MR. HAQUE:   Mr. Chairman, I made a somewhat&#13;
&#13;
 radical suggestion which I thought would merit a mention,&#13;
&#13;
 which was that in order to resolve the question which&#13;
&#13;
 Board would be competent, whether the strategy is a&#13;
&#13;
 segmented strategy or integrated strategy, I had suggested&#13;
&#13;
 that the endorsement, if we use the word "endorsement" or&#13;
&#13;
 some other word, must be done by the joint meeting of both&#13;
&#13;
 Boards.&#13;
&#13;
             This was meant to resolve one or two specific&#13;
&#13;
 problems.    One was that, as I said earlier, the question&#13;
&#13;
 was what will be the competence of the Board, whether one&#13;
&#13;
 Board will be only confining itself to its own mandate or&#13;
&#13;
 not.&#13;
&#13;
             And, second, as I said, the question was whether&#13;
&#13;
 it is an integrated strategy or not.         And, thirdly, even&#13;
&#13;
 the question will be this will, in my view, as stated&#13;
&#13;
 earlier, make even less formal the word "endorsement."&#13;
                                                                      Page139&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           So I suggest that my suggestion may very well&#13;
&#13;
 find a mention when you are making a summing-up.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Abraham?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. ABRAHAM:    Just a short note, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
 I think that was an excellent summary as far as I can&#13;
&#13;
 tell.   Just one thing that was really mentioned by a&#13;
&#13;
 number of Chairs, and that is the recognition of good&#13;
&#13;
 policy and whether somehow we would incorporate it there&#13;
&#13;
 because that is at the heart of a lot of programs that we&#13;
&#13;
 do recognize this if we want to make progress.          So I&#13;
&#13;
 thought maybe somehow it could be included.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you; good point.&#13;
&#13;
           Jean Pesme?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PESME:    Thank you, Sven.        Very briefly, and&#13;
&#13;
 not to open a discussion on these specific points, you&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned several countries which could come before the&#13;
&#13;
 spring meetings.   And if I refer to Table 2 in the costing&#13;
&#13;
 exercise, I had the feeling there were more countries than&#13;
&#13;
 the number you mentioned, so just to draw your attention&#13;
&#13;
 on this point.&#13;
                                                                     Page140&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:   Stephen?&#13;
&#13;
             MR. PICKFORD:    The same point.        I thought last&#13;
&#13;
 Wednesday we were told up to five.         The number has gone&#13;
&#13;
 down now.    And to pick up on the point that Mr. Haque&#13;
&#13;
 made, I think it is worth injecting some sense about the&#13;
&#13;
 way in which the two Boards are going to have to work out&#13;
&#13;
 some method of proceeding.&#13;
&#13;
             Personally, I think perhaps a joint informal&#13;
&#13;
 session first and then the two Boards go away and formally&#13;
&#13;
 consider, and also take decisions about the issues that&#13;
&#13;
 are relevant to the two institutions might be the way&#13;
&#13;
 forward.    But we're going to have to work these procedures&#13;
&#13;
 out.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Other advice?&#13;
&#13;
             If not, we'll work on this.       These were good&#13;
&#13;
 additions.    So we'll work on this and focus on this&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph on endorsement.      We'll circulate, then, the&#13;
&#13;
 revised summing-up later in the afternoon.            Hopefully, we&#13;
&#13;
 don't need a meeting tonight, but we'll see how it goes.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             [Whereupon, at 1:33 p.m., the informal meeting&#13;
                                                                       Page141&#13;
