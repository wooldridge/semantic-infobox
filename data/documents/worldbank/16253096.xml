            Multi-utilities and access : can private
            multi-utilities help expand service to rural areas?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 1997 Gabon awarded the first real
            concession in Africa, under a contract that introduced
            coverage targets for expanding service to previously
            unconnected rural areas. SEEG, the new concessionaire,
            offers both water and electricity service, with the
            electricity business cross-subsidizing the less developed
            water business. Five years on, the concessionaire has
            performed well in established service areas, often exceeding
            targets, but has made less progress in more isolated areas.
            This Note assesses lessons for the design of contracts with
            incentives for expanding service beyond the immediate
            circles of major urban centers-and on the potential role of multi-utilities.
