ABSTRACT&#13;
Successful completion of Yugoslavia's structural adjustment&#13;
programn requires stricter financial discipline to increase the economic&#13;
pressure on public enterprises to adjust. This paper focuses on two&#13;
aspects of the general question of financial discipline: rehabilitation&#13;
and bankruptcy of loss-making enterprises and interenterprise credit. In&#13;
each case the nature of the problem, the present legal framework, recent&#13;
experience, and expected future developments are reviewed.&#13;
In 1981 loss-making firms were 7.8% of all Yugoslav social sector&#13;
firms in "economic" activities, employed 4.9% of all social sector workers&#13;
in these activities, and their losses came to roughly 1.5% of gross&#13;
material product. The bankruptcy and liquidation solution for loss-makers,&#13;
while well-defined in legislation, has rarely been invoked. In principle,&#13;
procedures for rehabilitation are adequate, but in practice they are seldom&#13;
fully executed. They also appear to provide insufficient pressure to&#13;
induce real adjustment by firms. Rehabilitation often involves extensive&#13;
grants in aid and loans at highly negative real interest rates. The result&#13;
is often more a bailout than a workout.&#13;
New legal measures have recently been enacted which should help&#13;
involve Yugoslav enterprises to achieve the objectives of the country's&#13;
structural adjustment program. But it will be necessary to mobilize the&#13;
political will to enforce the new legislation and that previously in the&#13;
books. The interlocking system of banks, enterprises and local governments&#13;
has produced a very soft budget constraint on the loss-making Yugoslav&#13;
firm. To break out of this self-serving system of rehabilitation&#13;
proceedings, it is necessary that they be conducted by an independent&#13;
agency. The Social Accounting Service (SDK) is the obvious candidate to&#13;
perform this function. Banks could also increase the technical assistance&#13;
component of their loans and the stringency of conditionality for&#13;
rehabilitation programs.&#13;
Use of enterprise-level data and multivariate analysis could help&#13;
determine more precisely the characteristics of loss-makers than has been&#13;
possible in this paper using subsectoral level data. Phasing out of price&#13;
controls and negative real interest rates are also important parts of a&#13;
program to increase financial discipline and promote structural adjustment.&#13;

Condense&#13;
Si l'on veut que le programme d'aJustement structurel de la&#13;
Yougoslavie aboutisse, il faut renforcer la discipline financiore afin qua&#13;
les pressions economiques qui s'exercent sur les entreprises publiques&#13;
augmentent, les obligeant a s'adapter. Ce document traite de deux aspects&#13;
de la discipline financi6re g le redressement et la liquidation des entre-&#13;
prises fonctionnant a perte et le credit interentreprises. On a 6tudi6&#13;
dans les deux cas la nature du probleme, le cadre juridique exKistant9 la&#13;
situation recente et 1P6volution probable0&#13;
En l98l1 les entreprises fonctionnant a perte representaient&#13;
798 % des organisations elementaires de travail associ6 exergant des acti-&#13;
vites "6conomiques", elles employaient 4,9 % des travailleurs de ces orga-&#13;
nisations et leurs pertes se chiffraient a environ 1,5 % du produit&#13;
materiel brut. La faillite et la liquidation des entreprises fonctionnant&#13;
a perte, si elles sont bien d6finies dans la legislation, ont rarement&#13;
lieu. En th6orie, les procedures de redressement sont satisfaisantes&#13;
mais9 dans la pratique, il est rare qu'elles soient appliquees jusqu'au&#13;
bout. I1 semble egalement que les pressions ne sont pas suffisantes pour&#13;
inciter les entreprises a veritablement s'adapter a leurs strsuctures0 Le&#13;
redressement s'accompagne fr6quemm.ent de dons tres importants et de prets&#13;
accord6s a des taux d'int6r8t reels tres n6gatifs0 Le resultat n'est&#13;
souvent qu'un mieux temporaireO&#13;
De nouveaux textes ont ete recemment promulgu6s , qu° devraient&#13;
inciter les entreprises yougoslaves a atteindre lee objectif£ du programme&#13;
national d'ajustement structurel. Hais il fauera amener les pouvoirs&#13;
publics a faire appliquer la nouvelle l6giGiation ainsi que cemIe qui est&#13;
deja en vigueur. Etant donne linterdependance des banques, des&#13;
entreprises et des collectivites locales, les entreprises yougoslaves&#13;
fonctionnant a perte n9ont guere ete soumises a des pressions&#13;
budgetaires= Pour sortir de ce circuit ferm6, il faut que lee op6rations&#13;
de redressement soient confi6es a un organisere ind6pendant. Le Service de&#13;
la comptabilite sociale (SDK) est le candid2t tout d6sign6 pour cette&#13;
fonction. Les banques pourraient 6galement accroltre la composante&#13;
assistance technique de leurs prets et suoordonner leur aide er faveur des&#13;
prograxmes de redressement i des conditions plus strictes.&#13;
Des donnees sur chaque entreprise et une analyse a. variables&#13;
multiples pourraient aider a determiner plus precisement les&#13;
caracteristiques des entreprises fonctionnant a perte quon a pz. le faire&#13;
dans ce document avec les donnees sous-sectorielles dont on disposait.&#13;
L'6limination progressive du controle des prix et des taux dtinteret reels&#13;
n6gatifs sont egalement des elements importants de tout prograir-e visant a&#13;
accroltre la discipline financiere et a encourager l'ajustement structurel.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
EXTRACTO&#13;
Para que Yugoslavia pueda llevar a buen fin su programa de ajuste&#13;
estructural se requiere una disciplina financiera mAs estricta, a fin de&#13;
intensificar la presi6n econ6mica para que las empresas puiblicas efectuen&#13;
un ajuste. Este estudio se concentra en dos aspectos de la cuesti6n&#13;
general de la disciplina financiera: rehabilitaci6n y quiebra de las&#13;
empresas que dejan perdidas y cr6dito entre empresa. En cada caso se&#13;
analizan la indole del problema, el marco juridico actual, la experiencia&#13;
reciente y la evoluci6n que se preve.&#13;
En 1981 las firmas que dejaban perdidas constituian el 7,8% del total&#13;
de firmas del sector social yugoslavo dedicadas a actividades&#13;
"econ6micas", empleaban al 4,9% del total de trabajadores del sector&#13;
social empleados en esas actividades y sus p6rdidas ascendian&#13;
aproximadamente al 1,5% del producto material bruto. Rara vez se ha&#13;
recurrido a la soluci6n de la quiebra y liquidaci6n de las empresas que&#13;
dejan perdidas, aunque 6sta esta claramente definida en las leyes. En&#13;
principio, los procedimientos de rehabilitaci6n son adecuados pero en la&#13;
practica pocas veces se ejecutan en forma cabal. Aparentemente, la&#13;
presi6n que ejercen es insuficiente para inducir a las firmas a efectuar&#13;
un ajuste real. La rehabilitaci6n frecuentemente comporta grandes&#13;
donaciones o subvenciones y prestamos a tipos de interes reales muy&#13;
negativos. Frecuentemente el resultado es una operaci6n de salvamento mAs&#13;
bien que un esfuerzo por resolver el problema.&#13;
Recientemente se han promulgado disposiciones legales que tienen por&#13;
objeto ayudar a que las empresas yugoslavas participen en los esfuerzos&#13;
por lograr los objetivos del programa de ajuste estructural del pais.&#13;
Pero sera necesario movilizar la voluntad politica para exigir el&#13;
cumplimiento tanto de las leyes nuevas como de las que ya existian. El&#13;
sistema de tener bancos, empresas y gobiernos locales con miembros comunes&#13;
ha traido como consecuencia una limitaci6n presupuestaria muy debil para&#13;
las firmas yugoslavas que dejan perdidas. Para terminar con este sistema&#13;
de rehabilitaci6n que sirve los intereses propios a costa de los demAs es&#13;
necesario que el procedimiento sea llevado a cabo por un organismo&#13;
independiente. El Servicio de Contabilidad Social es un candidato obvio&#13;
para desempeniar esta funci6n. Los bancos tambi6n podrian incrementar el&#13;
componente asistencia tecnica de sus pr6stamos e imponer una&#13;
condicionalidad mas estricta para los programas de rehabilitaci6n.&#13;
El uso de datos a nivel de las empresas y del analisis de multiples&#13;
variables ayudaria a determinar las caracteristicas de las empresas que&#13;
dejan perdidas de manera mas precisa que lo que se ha podido en este&#13;
estudio usando datos de nivel subsectorial. La eliminaci6n gradual de los&#13;
controles de precios y los tipos de inter6s reales negativos tambi6n&#13;
constituye una parte importante de todo programa que tenga por objeto&#13;
aumentar la disciplina financiera y promover el ajuste estructural.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
Adjusting the structure of an economy to operate efficiently&#13;
with higher real energy prices and to obtain greater benefits from&#13;
international trade requires both modification of economic behavior at the&#13;
enterprise level and new investments. Enterprises must adapt to prices&#13;
reflecting new relative scarcities. New technologies, products, markets,&#13;
and sources of supply must be sought. While much adjustment can be&#13;
achieved without physical investment, often new plants, machinery and&#13;
equipment are needed to achieve the full potential benefits of the&#13;
adjustment process. On the other hand, inefficient investment, not guided&#13;
by appropriate factor and product prices, may hinder rather than further&#13;
the adjustment process.&#13;
In a market economy, enterprises which fail to adjust to a&#13;
changed economic environment are likely to experience losses and&#13;
eventually bankruptcy. The prospect of bankruptcy is the ultimate "stick"&#13;
which complements the carrot of greater profits which await successful&#13;
adjusters. But bankruptcy and attendant liquidation of going concerns have&#13;
high economic, social, and political costs. Hence, in most countries&#13;
provision is made for "workout" or rehabilitation solutions. Bankruptcy&#13;
and liquidation remain as last resorts when rehabilitation fails.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Yugoslavia is no exception. Yugoslav enterpriscs uhich have&#13;
incurred losses have had recourse to a wide variety of sources fcr covering&#13;
the losses. Among them are not only their own reserves, but also rese::ves&#13;
of other basic organizations of associated labor (BOALs) with which they&#13;
are linked by self-management agreements (SMAs), "solidarity contributions"&#13;
from other enterprises to which they are not linked by SMAs but which are&#13;
important suppliers and customers, pooled reserves at the commune and&#13;
republican provincial level, bank loans and reschedulings, 9 riteoffs of&#13;
debts, and postponement or canceling of tax and contribution obligations to&#13;
sociopolitical communities (SPCs -- the Yugoslav term for federal,&#13;
republican/provincial and commune governments) and communities providing&#13;
social services all without any direct contribution from the budgets of&#13;
SPCso1/&#13;
In addition, Yugoslav enterprises (and not just loss-makers)&#13;
have been able to obtain credit by paying for goods and services wiith&#13;
promissory notes and other forms of deferred payment which they have not&#13;
always executed when due. Beginning in 1977 the rise in registered&#13;
interenterprise claims has been well above the rate of infletion.&#13;
1/ Unless otherwise indicated, the word enterprises refers to BOALs, work&#13;
organizations not composed of BOALs, basic cooperative essociations,&#13;
basic organizations of cooperative associations, artisar and other&#13;
cooperatives, and contractual organizations of associated labor. For a&#13;
brief description of the evolution of the Yugoslav system of worker&#13;
self-management and its specialized terminology, see the section on&#13;
Yugoslavia in the author's "Economic Reforms in Socialist Countries.&#13;
The Experiences of China, Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia," World Bank&#13;
Staff Working Paper No. 579 (Washington, DoCoo The World Bank, 1983).&#13;
For more details, see the references on Yugoslavia in the bibliography&#13;
of that paper.&#13;

There has been widespread discussion in the press of the scale of&#13;
enterprise losses and the laxity of financial discipline that they&#13;
represent. A consensus appears to be forming among Yugoslav economists and&#13;
policy-makers that succesful completion of the country's structural&#13;
adjustment program requires stricter financial discipline to increase the&#13;
economic pressure on enterprises to adjust. To use the term coined by the&#13;
Hungarian economist Janos Kornai, the "soft budget constraint" facing&#13;
Yugoslav enterprises needs to be "hardened".l/&#13;
Table 1 provides statistics on tae extent of uncovered losses&#13;
incurred in 1981. Loss-making BOALs in "economic" activities (sectors 1-11&#13;
in the Yugoslav classification) were 7.8X of all BOALs, employed 4.97 of all&#13;
social sector workers, and the losses came to roughly 1.5% of social sector&#13;
gross material product (GMP) for these activities. These numbers appear to&#13;
be significant from macroeconomic viewpoint, though not overwhelming. But&#13;
the uncovered losses in Table I may only be the tip of an iceberg. Losses&#13;
already covered at the time annual financial reports were submitted were&#13;
some 26% greater than uncovered losses (see statistical Appendix Table&#13;
A1.3). Interest rates charged on loans to BOALs have been well below the&#13;
rate of inflation, resulting in hidden subsidies. And given the&#13;
increasingly difficult economic situation faced by the country since 1982,&#13;
with decreased demand and acute shortages of foreign exchange, the problem&#13;
has probably become more serious, though the statistics on losses for these&#13;

years were not available to the author at the time the main text of this&#13;
paper was written (October 1983). In any case, the meaning of a loss in&#13;
Yugoslavia is quite different from that in Western countries, as is&#13;
explained in the next section of the paper. This means that comparisons&#13;
with data for other countries are risky.&#13;
It is likely, however, that without more effective financial&#13;
controls and a greater possibility of bankruptcy than has prevailed in the&#13;
past, the allocation gains of a greater reliance on the price system, which&#13;
is now planned, will be lost. The issue of enterprise losses is also&#13;
intimately related to issues of nominal incomes policy, price control,&#13;
interenterprise credit (and hence monetary policy) and national savings.&#13;
This paper focuses on ttwo aspects of the general question of&#13;
financial discipline in Yugoslavia- rehabilitation and bankruptcy of&#13;
loss-making enterprises and interenterprise credit0 In each case the nature&#13;
of the problem, the present legal framework, recent experience, and expected&#13;
future developments are review,ed0  Conclusions and policy recommendations&#13;
are contained in the final section of the paper0 A short postcript provides&#13;
some information on developments through June, 1984.&#13;

Rehabilitation and Bankruptcyf Loae-Making Enter_rises&#13;
The Problem&#13;
When a bankrupt firm is liquidated assets are generally sold at&#13;
distress prices, i.e. at prices far below their reproduction value.l/ The&#13;
proceeds to the creditors fall short of the principal value of their claims&#13;
and debt is extinguished. The services required in the form of lawyers,&#13;
asset-selling expenses and the like constitute a considerable consumption&#13;
of real resources which corresponds to both a private and a social cost.&#13;
The financial costs associated with the termination of labor and other&#13;
contracts are a private cost to claimants, if not a social one. Also,&#13;
assets are often sold at distress prices on liquidation, and creditors and&#13;
holders of the last shreds of equity in troubled firms receive less than&#13;
"fair value" for their claims. For these reasons, these private parties&#13;
prefer "workout" or rehabilitation solutions to bankruptcy.&#13;
There are additional costs to society inherent in bankruptcy, and&#13;
for these reasons bankruptcy law and social practice (including that of&#13;
Yugoslavia) try to promote rehabilitation and avoid liquidation when&#13;
possible0 An enterprise is more than the sum of its real and financial&#13;
assets - it is a going concern0 Its value as such is its goodwill or&#13;
intangible assets0 In economic terms, the firm is an organization that&#13;
embodies human capital and a technology    that of the management of labor&#13;
1/ I am indebted to Frank Veneroso for the ideas and much of the language&#13;
of this and the following paragraph.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and capital. In their haste to get their fair share of a troubled company's&#13;
eroding assets, creditors in Western countries often opt for liquidation,&#13;
even if it involves disruption of enterprise management structures and&#13;
production, breaking up a functioning organization that would be costly to&#13;
reproduce.&#13;
In Yugoslavia, the banKruptcy and liquidation solution for&#13;
loss-makers has rarely been invoked and the procedures for rehabilitation,&#13;
while in principle adequate, in practice are seldom fully executed. They&#13;
also appear to provide insuffienct pressure to induce real structural&#13;
adjustment by firms. The Yugoslav rehabilitation often smells more of a&#13;
bailout than a workout. The problem, therefore, is how to secure more&#13;
effective adjustment by increasing the credibility of the bankruptcy threat&#13;
while putting more "teeth" into rehabilitation procedures.&#13;
Before proceeding to a summary description of the existing&#13;
legislation governing rehabilitation and bankruptcy of loss-making&#13;
enterprises, a short digression is necessary to clarify the special meaning&#13;
of the losses in the Yugoslav systems of worker's self-management. In this&#13;
system the basic accounting and legal unit is the BOAL. While "kombinats"&#13;
and intermediate "work organizations" are composed of multiple BOALS linked&#13;
by SMAs, all assets, equity and liabilities remain under the control of&#13;
BOALs. It is the practice for a kombinat to prepare and submit to the&#13;
Social Accounting Service (SDK) consoldiated accounts for the BOALs which&#13;
comprise it. Such a consolidation, however, cannot be viewed as an organic&#13;
unity, as is often appropriate in considering the accounts of a holding&#13;
company and its subsidiaries in Western countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In the Yugoslav system, labor rather than capital is the residual&#13;
claimant of the surplus left after paying for purchased inputs and services&#13;
(including borrowed capital) and taxes. Labor income is not considered a&#13;
cost.  In principle, capital is own^ed by society, but in practice its&#13;
rental value accrues to groups of workers (including managers' who enjoy&#13;
its usufruct, except in the case where such workers lend it for interest to&#13;
another BOAL, either directly or through the banking system. In this case&#13;
the interest income accrues to the group of workers lending the capital and&#13;
only any return above the interest goes to the workers actually "employing°&#13;
it0&#13;
Article 154 of the Associated Labor Act of 1976 states that a&#13;
basic organization shall be considered to have incurred a bus_ness loss if,&#13;
according to its annual balance sheet, it has not received sufficient&#13;
income to cover amounts spent on personal incomes provisionally accounted&#13;
and paid out, or to pay statutorily-guaranteed personal incomes for the&#13;
accounting business period for which personal incomes have not been&#13;
provisionally accounted or paid, or for which statutorily guar-nteed&#13;
personal incomes have not been paid.&#13;
Thus it is possible for a firm whose workers vote themselves&#13;
excessively generous advances on personal incomes (e.g. incomes well above&#13;
the average for the activity involved) to incur a loss lacking the normal&#13;
economic significance of a loss in most Wiestern countries0 The&#13;
(understandable) reluctance of workers' councils to fire or lay-off&#13;
colleagues tends to produce losses when demand falls if personel incomes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
are not reduced. On the other hand, a loss might be a "programmed" one&#13;
caused by economic polices, such as price controls on the firm's output,&#13;
which have no efficiency implications for the firm. A loss of this kind&#13;
would not call for economic adjustment by the firm in question, but rather&#13;
changes in price policy on the provision of some form of subsidy.&#13;
The Legal Framework as of April 1983&#13;
The basic legal framework for enterprise rehabilitation and&#13;
bankruptcy in Yugoslavia is the law on Rehabilitation and Liquidation of&#13;
Organizations of Associated Labor of July 1980. This law became effective&#13;
on December 31, 1980 and has since been amended three times. The following&#13;
is a brief summary description of its major provisions and covers the law&#13;
as amended through April 1983. A more detailed description is contained in&#13;
the Annex to this paper. The amendments of June 1983 are set forth in&#13;
Annex 2.&#13;
Three types of rehabilitation procedures of progressively greater&#13;
severity are provided for. The first two are technically known as&#13;
"pre-rehabilitation" procedures. More formal rehabilitation procedures,&#13;
for which statistics are regularly reported by the SDK, apply to&#13;
enterprises showing losses on their annual financial reports (AFRs), due by&#13;
the end of February of the following year. An enterprise showing a loss on&#13;
its AFR must initiate a set of procedures following a timetable specified&#13;
in the law. These include informing associated BOALs and various official&#13;
organizations, including the relevant SPCs and the SDK, of its situation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10 &#13;
and the procedures adopted, establishing the causes of and responsibility&#13;
for the loss, and the means to be taken for eliminating the lose. It also&#13;
includes adopting a rehabilitation program wihich specifies, inter alia, the&#13;
method and deadlines for obtaining funds to cover losses not already&#13;
covered from non-reimbursable sources (its own reserve funds, reserve funds&#13;
or net income of associated BOALs linked by a SMA on the pooling or labor&#13;
and resources, or other sources), and (if the loss was found to be due to&#13;
obsolete technology, inadequate productive capacity, a shortage of working&#13;
capital, or uneconomic business operations) measures and financial means to&#13;
solve the problem.&#13;
Requests for funds to cover the loss together with a copy of the&#13;
rehabilitation program must be sent to BOALs with which the loss-making&#13;
BOAL is linked by a SMA, BOALs with which it has generated more than half&#13;
its total revenue declared in the AFR in w^hich the uncovered loos is shown,&#13;
the joint reserve fund for the territory of the SPC in which it has pooled&#13;
its reserve funds, the compentent body of the SPC, and the compentent&#13;
branch of the SDKo In the rehabilitation proceedings funds must be&#13;
obtained at least up to the level of the uncovered loss and of three major&#13;
types: non-reimbursable resources, writeoffs of creditors' claims, and&#13;
rehabilitation credits. If the loss-making BCAL does not cover the loss&#13;
and fails to find parties willing to do so (called rehabilitation&#13;
administrators) within the time limits established (that is by roughly&#13;
August 8 of the year following that in which the loss was incur-..d) it must&#13;
submit to the general association with wihich it is ascociated, without&#13;
delay, a proposal for initiating rehabilitation with a view to finding the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
rehabilitation administrator. When rehabilitation administrators have been&#13;
found, a SMA on mutual relations under rehabilitation must be established&#13;
setting forth the rights and duties of all parties concerned, including the&#13;
basis and criteria for determine personal incomes for the duration of the&#13;
rehabilitating program as well as the method of coordinating positions and&#13;
joint decision-making in cases where the workers of the BOAL under&#13;
rehabilitation do not act in conformity with the obligations they assumed&#13;
in the SMA on rehabilitation. This SMA may envisage that the&#13;
administrators participate in the BOAL's decision-making on the execution&#13;
of the rehabilitation program.&#13;
If no rehabilitation administrators are forthcoming by&#13;
approximately September 7 of the year following that in which the loss was&#13;
incurred, consultations on a reduction in claims by creditors must be&#13;
initiated. If an agreement cannot be reached within another 30 days,&#13;
bankruptcy proceedings must be initiated. These may lead either to an&#13;
enforced settlement (reduction in claims) or liquidation of the debtor BOAL.&#13;
Recent Experience&#13;
The statistical material concerning rehabilitation which was made&#13;
available to the World Bank mission does not include pre-rehabilitation&#13;
programs. Nevertheless, interviews with enterprises and banks indicate&#13;
that considerable effort and resources are expended by both enterprises and&#13;
their creditors to avoid an enterprise showing a loss on the AFR and&#13;
thereby entering formal rehabilitation proceedings. Reportedly funds for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12 &#13;
projects under construction are sometimes diverted to finance working&#13;
capital for existing activities. This is one of many factors Leading to&#13;
cost overruns and delays in investment projects. Indirect financing to&#13;
avoid an enterprise showing a loss may be provided when its bank finances&#13;
the enterprise's suppliers and/or customers.&#13;
An example of a partially successful pre-rehabilitaton program is&#13;
provided by the national airlines JATO At the end of June 1982 losses&#13;
totaled some Din 780 million, but they were reduced to Din 450 million by&#13;
December 31 through a combination of a freeze on new hiring, revision of&#13;
flight schedules to increase load factors, an expense control program, and&#13;
by holding increases in personal incomes below the rate of inflation.&#13;
Seasonal factors may also have helped improve performance0 As part of the&#13;
pre-rehabilitation program, JAT launched a study on reorganization of the&#13;
enterprise which was expected to result in consolidating its Sia2 BOALs into&#13;
one or two, with considerable cost savings through elimination of&#13;
management functions and better control over costs, including advances on&#13;
personal income0&#13;
For all Yugoslavia, total losses as shown in annual financial&#13;
reports at the time of presentation to SDK came to 1.6%, 1.3% and 104% of&#13;
GMP respectively in 1979, 1980, and 1981 (see Table 2). In 1981 losses&#13;
reported were a total of Din 31 billion, of which Din 6.6 billion (21%)&#13;
were covered from non-reimbursable funds, as specified by the 1980&#13;

The undisputed leader in loss-making in relation to GNP is Kosovo.&#13;
Uncovered losses for 1981 were shown by 1277 BOALs with 261,634&#13;
workers, or 4o5% of the workers in the social sector (including&#13;
'unon-economic" activities) that year. The number of BOALs and uorkers in&#13;
loss-making BOALs in 1981 were 7.7% and 6.8% below the levels in 1979 (see&#13;
Table 2)o&#13;
Table 4 summarizes the way uncovered losses for the years 1979=81&#13;
were financed in the year following that in which the loss was incurred.&#13;
Coverage from reimbursable sources fell from 14.4% of the total in 1979 to&#13;
12.5% in 1981. Other BOALs provided an increasing percentage of coverage,&#13;
reaching 5.8% of total uncovered losses show-fn on the AFRs for 1981 Another&#13;
important trend is the decline in non-reimbursable funding from SPCs and&#13;
"other users of social resources" (reportedly mostly communities of&#13;
interest). These are healthy trends since they are likely to Tesult in&#13;
increased pressure on loss-making BOALs to improve their performance by&#13;
workers in other BOALs. SPCs and communities of interect are more distant&#13;
and impersonal, and their contribution does not normally take the form of&#13;
budgetary allocations, but rather the pardoning or deferral of ax aend&#13;
contribution obligations.&#13;

The share of losses financed by rehabilitation credits fell from&#13;
809% in 1979 to 6606% in l981. This is almost all accounted for by&#13;
decreases in the share of credits supplied by banks and by SPCs and other&#13;
users of social resources. Again this can be interpreted as a favorable&#13;
phenomenon. A caveat is posed by another trend, however, the increase in&#13;
the share of uncovered losses shown on AFRs which remained uncovered at the&#13;
end of the year following that in which they were incurred. It rose from&#13;
4.7% for losses incurred in 1970 to 20C9% for losses incurred in 1981. As&#13;
will be discussed below, an amendment to the rehabilitation and bankruptcy&#13;
law passed in June 1983 authorizes the SDK to initiate bankruptcy&#13;
proceedings for any enterprise still showing an uncovered loss as of&#13;
December 31 of the year following its incurral.&#13;
Table 5 shows total losses recorded in AFRs for 1981 at the time&#13;
they were prepered, investments during l19l in BOALs showing losses, and&#13;
the total amount of rehabilitation credits outstanding and disbursed for&#13;
twelve four-digit industrial subsectors which had losses exceeding Din 800&#13;
million (US$23 million) in 1981 as showni in Table A 103 of the Statistical&#13;
Appendixo These 12 industrial subsectors were responsible for 68% of all&#13;
losses shown on the 1981 AFRso The average loss in these subsectors was&#13;
4.4% of subsectoral GNP, compared with 1o6% for all economic activities&#13;
(sectors 0l=il). Subsectors whose losses were more than 6% of subsectoral&#13;
GMP were iron and steel (6.7%), non-ferrouo metals (2MM%), manufacture of&#13;
chemicals (15.6%), food processing (6.2%) and railways (702%)o Note that&#13;
electric energy (106%) was at the average for all economic activities in&#13;
1981.&#13;

investment in fixed assets in lose-making BOALs averaged 308% of&#13;
subsectoral GMP in all industrial subsectors with losses above Din 800&#13;
million compared with 107% for all economic sectors. Subsectors with&#13;
investment in loss-makers over 5% of subsectoral GMP were manufacture of&#13;
chemicals (5.4%), building materials (7.09%), paper (7.O%), food processing&#13;
(600%) and railways (1304%).&#13;
Whether investment in loss-making BOALs represents modernization&#13;
and expansion of productive capacity that will reduce future losses, or&#13;
good money following bad cannot be determined from these data0 Investment&#13;
in 1981 at the sub-sectoral level is, however, positively and significantly&#13;
correlated with losses in that year as well as with investment in 1980ol/&#13;
While such a positive statistical association does not prove that&#13;
investment is caused by losses or by previous investment, it does suggest&#13;
that loss-makers do not tend to cut back on investment.&#13;

The provisions of the Law on Rehabilitation and Liquidation appear&#13;
to induce loss-making BOALs to carry out additional investment, and the&#13;
rehabilitation procedures prescribed by this law suggest that such&#13;
investment may not be rigorously appraised for its economic viability. The&#13;
workers' council of the loss-making BOAL determines the causes of losses,&#13;
which may be inefficient management and/or workers, obsolete technology or&#13;
other bottlenecks in productive capacity, and/or the government's price&#13;
intervention policies. The self-criticism does not appear to work well, and&#13;
the first cause is rarely established. The second cause is frequently&#13;
accepted, and the predictable response is to invest further. In the case of&#13;
the third cause, the BOAL often chooses to diversify by investment. Since&#13;
the decision-makers' (members of the workers' council) jobs are at stake,&#13;
the option of closing the facility and cutting losses is almost never&#13;
seriously considered.&#13;
Rehabilitation credits outstanding and disbursed as of 30 September&#13;
1982 totaled 8.4% of 1981 subsectoral GMP in the 12 selected subsectors&#13;
compared with 3.5% for all economic activities. Subsectors where such&#13;
credits exceeded 10% of subsectoral GMP include non-ferrous metals (31.3%),&#13;
manufacture of chemicals (22.1%), building materials (11.0%) and railways&#13;
(17.0%). In industry and mining, 72% of uncovered losses reported in the&#13;
AFRs for 1981 were covered by rehabilitation credits as of the end of 1982&#13;
(see Statistical Appendix Table A 2.3).&#13;
Using four rather arbitrary criteria -- (1) subsectoral losses&#13;
greater than Din 800 million for 1981, 1981 (2) losses greater than 6% of&#13;
1981 subsectoral GMP, (3) 1981 investment in loss-makers greater than 5% of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
subsectoral GMP for 1981, and (4) rehabilitation credits outstanding and&#13;
disbursed as of 30 September 1982 greater than 10% of 1981 subsectoral GHP&#13;
-- the leading loss-making absorbers of resources are given in the&#13;
following table.&#13;

Table 6 shows that the great majority of enterprises with&#13;
uncovered losses on their AFRs (84% for 1981) completed rehabilitation&#13;
programs in the following year. Since the Rehabilitation and Liquidation&#13;
Law of 1980 became effective the number of BOALs initiating procedures for&#13;
fixing responsibility for losses has risen sharply, reaching 38.9% in 1982&#13;
for the BOALs showing uncovered losses in 1981.   Apparently this was still&#13;
not a popular activity, despite the legal obligation of workers in all&#13;
BOALs reporting uncovered losses on their AFRs to institute such procedures&#13;
within 30 days of adopting the AFRo Even less common was the initiation of&#13;
procedures to remove managers. This took place during the subsequent year&#13;
in 14% of the BOALs showing uncovered losses in their 1980 AFRs, but only&#13;
2% of the BOALs showing uncovered losses in their 1981 AFRs.&#13;
Initiation of bankruptcy procedures was a truly rare event,&#13;
affecting only 14 BOALs (1% of all BOALs showing uncovered losses in their&#13;
1981 AFRs) with 1,306 workers in 1982, the continuation of a decline from&#13;
29 BOALs and 7,279 workers in 1980 under the old bankruptcy law0&#13;

Banks do not generally provide financial support for a&#13;
rehabilitation program if the enterprise in question has not made a&#13;
significant contribution from its own resources. The extent to which banks&#13;
take an active part in the elaboration, execution and monitoring of&#13;
rehabilitation programs varies considerably. In some cases tney make their&#13;
own analysis of the causes of losses and insist on strong conditionality,&#13;
including reductions in personal incomes, in return for rescheduling debts,&#13;
granting rehabilitation credits, or financing new investments as part of a&#13;
rehabilitation program. They may insist on use of external consultants by&#13;
the loss-making enterprise to help in the diagnosis of econom.!c ills and&#13;
the prescription of appropriate remedies. They may participate in frequent&#13;
meetings of the rehabilitation administrators to monitor the execution of&#13;
the rehabilitation program.&#13;
But banks may also be subject to considerable pressure from the&#13;
enterprise in difficulties, particularly if it is large and a founding&#13;
member of the bank in question0 Bank officials admit that there are cases&#13;
when this pressure is strong enough that the bank feels it has little&#13;
choice in responding to a rehabilitation program proposed by such a&#13;
loss-maker, and consequently takes a fairly passive role in meeting its&#13;
demands with few questions asked0 Frequently pressure to accommodate also&#13;
comes from SPCs on whose territory the loss-maker is based0 Banks&#13;
generally administer common reserve furds at the level of SPCs, and are&#13;
expected to provide a recommendation as to their use to the governing&#13;
boards of these funds which approve the granting of rehabilitation credits0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The consolidated balance sheet for the common reserve funds of&#13;
all Yugoslav sociopolitical communities for 1980 and 1981 may be found in&#13;
the Statistical Appendix, Table A 5.1. As of 31 December 1981, total&#13;
assets were Din 59.4 billion, equivalent to 2.7% of Yugoslavia's GMP in&#13;
that year. Of this total, 79% consisted in credits for the coverage of&#13;
losses. The largest source of funds was pooled reserves of BOALs, which&#13;
accounted for 58% of total liabilities of the consolidated common reserve&#13;
funds. An additional 28% of the liabilities were made up of credits&#13;
received.&#13;
Interest rates on rehabilitation credits from banks were&#13;
reportedly in the 5-7% range in 1982, but in 1983 are on the order of&#13;
14%-18%. The interest rate on rehabilitation credits from common reserve&#13;
funds is reportedly only 4% for periods up to 10 years, the period being&#13;
based on the economic possibilities of the loss-making enterprise.&#13;
Investment credits for modernization or expansion under&#13;
rehabilitation programs generally carry more favorable conditions than&#13;
normal investment credits and BOALs under rehabilitation may receive up to&#13;
100% bank financing for such investments, i.e. they are exempt from the&#13;
normal requirements for financing a percentage of the investment from&#13;
retained earnings. Highly negative real rates of interest and 100% bank&#13;
financing may constitute powerful incentives to incur losses.&#13;
It is difficult to determine to what extent loss-making&#13;
enterprises have actually reduced personal incomes as part of&#13;
rehabilitation programs, though in principle the SDK could determine this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26 -&#13;
from the data which it possesses. Table A 202(c) in the Statis';ical&#13;
Appendix provides some data on the way personal incomes in BOALs showing&#13;
uncovered losses on their 1980 AFRs determined personal incomes, but not on&#13;
their absolute levels. This information is summarized in the following&#13;
table, which gives the percentage of the total of 1303 loss-making BOALs&#13;
using different methods.&#13;

Note that only a total of 7% of the BOALs were paying out the&#13;
guaranteed (minimum) personal incomes or amounts specified in an SMA on&#13;
rehabilitation0 The mission heard reports that there is no significant&#13;
difference in personal incomes paid by loss-making enterprises as opposed&#13;
to those operating profitably, but was not able to verify this0    it was&#13;
observed, however, that reducing personal incomes may result in the loss of&#13;
an enterprise's better workers, and that maintaining incomes at the nominal&#13;
level of the previous year may be too drastic a measure to enforce when&#13;
inflation is running at 20 to 30% a year0&#13;
Developments through June 1983&#13;
The Anti-Inflation Program prepared by the Stabilization&#13;
Commission in 1982 argued that business losses of enterprises have in&#13;
practice been socialized to an excessively high degree with the result that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
their workers are not sufficiently interested in, and are in fact&#13;
noticeably indifferent to, business losses.l/ This document calls for&#13;
applying stricter measures which would accelerate the process of&#13;
rationalizing work in loss-making enterprises so as to cover and eliminate&#13;
the losses and further encourage them to avoid operating at a loss in the&#13;
future. Among the measures called for applying to enterprises showing&#13;
losses on their AFRs are:&#13;
(a) mandatory reduction in personal incomes by a given&#13;
percentage;&#13;
(b) exemption from income taxes and other contributions payable&#13;
out of income and from obligations to contribute to the&#13;
funds for accelerated development of less developed regions;&#13;
(c) reduction in depreciation charges on the condition that&#13;
they be offset by increases in later years;&#13;
(d) provisions that rehabilitation programs should envisage&#13;
eliminating surplus labor by introducing additional shifts,&#13;
increasing capital utilization or expanding the production&#13;
program, and if these measures are not possible by reducing&#13;
the number of workers employed;&#13;
(e) mandatory elections for a new workers' council and&#13;
management body at the end of each year during which an&#13;
enterprise operates as a loss;&#13;

well-known economists and policy-makers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(f) greater emphasis on solidarity and mutual responsibility of&#13;
other BOALs in the same work organization or composite&#13;
organization or self-managed community of interest in accord&#13;
with the SMA on association;&#13;
(g) mandatory sharing by banks in the risks of credits extended&#13;
to loss-making enterprises through cancelling interest on&#13;
regular credits to such enterprises and rescheduling&#13;
investment credits;&#13;
(h) reducing or eliminating fiscal and other contributory&#13;
obligations of loss-making enterprises to SPCs and&#13;
self-managing communities of interest;&#13;
(i)  special compensation for "programmed losses' of enterprises&#13;
which must operate at a loss because of price controls&#13;
imposed on them;&#13;
(j)  elimination of common reserve funds at the regional level and&#13;
their transformation into institutions through which payments&#13;
will be provided for decreased personal incomes of workers;&#13;
and&#13;
(k) faster liquidation of enterprises in the event that&#13;
rehabilitation programs fail, with due attention being paid&#13;
to reemployment of their workers, but only where economically&#13;
justified -- unemployed workers would get social benefits.l/&#13;

As of April 1983, it was already possible for loss-makers to&#13;
reschedule depreciation payments as proposed by the Stabilization&#13;
Commission. At that time, a number of amendments to the 1980&#13;
Rehabilitation and Liquidation Law were under discussion. Briefly, these&#13;
were meant to further strengthen the role of banks and other organizations&#13;
that participate in financing the rehabilitation program in the design and&#13;
monitoring of rehabilitation procedures and to provide for the possibility&#13;
of replacing and recalling managers of loss-making enterprises. The power&#13;
of rehabilitation administrators was to be strengthened to enable them to&#13;
influence the production and planning decisions of the loss-making&#13;
enterprise. Loss-making BOALs were to be required to identify the causes&#13;
of losses and to assign responsibility to individual workers, managers, or&#13;
management bodies. The competent agency of the SPC and the SDK were to be&#13;
informed by the BOAL of these actions. Were the BOAL to fail to determine&#13;
the causes of its losses, the draft amendments provided for the&#13;
intervention of bodies of the SPC as provided for in Article 622 of the&#13;
Associated Labor Act.l/ The SDK which has the power to block payments&#13;
1/ Art. 622 of the Associated Labor Act allows the SPC to take the&#13;
following measures of social protection against an organization of&#13;
associated labor (OAL):&#13;
(a) Change the business-managing organ;&#13;
(b) Relieve of duty individual workers vested with special authority&#13;
and responsibilities;&#13;
(c) Dissolve the workers' council;&#13;
(d) Dissolve the executive organ;&#13;
(e) Temporarily restrict the exercise of specified self-management&#13;
rights of workers;&#13;
(f) Appoint a temporary organ in the OAL;&#13;
(g) Order other statutorily-prescribed temporary measures.&#13;
Measures under (e) and (f) may not last longer than specified by law,&#13;
and in no case for more than one year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
of personal incomes in excess of the levels established in the&#13;
rehabilitation program, was to be authorized to institute bankruptcy&#13;
proceedings in court if the BOAL failed to cover its losses within a&#13;
specified period.&#13;
The final amendments to the Rehabilitation and Liquidation Law were&#13;
passed by the Federal Assembly in June 1983. These amendments do not differ&#13;
significantly from the draft amendments.l/ Essentially the final amendments&#13;
suggest a further strengthening of the role of the SDK (unlike 'in the draft&#13;
amendments, the SDK can now initiate bankruptcy proceedings in court for&#13;
BOALs in railway, postal, telephone, telegraph, electric power and coal&#13;
industries) and provides for the imposition of penalties on BOALs and&#13;
lending banks for not fulfilling obligations listed in the Law.&#13;
An additional measure under consideration in April 1983 would&#13;
decrease the probability of enterprises operating at a loss was a draft law&#13;
on the provision of working capital to BOALs. This law would prohibit&#13;
investment in fixed assets by BOALs with insufficient working capital.&#13;
Likewise, such BOALs would not be permitted to receive investment credits&#13;
from banks unless at the same time the bank or other social sector&#13;
organization provides credit for the difference between the available&#13;
working capital from long-term sources prescribed by statute and for tne&#13;
working capital needed for the new investment.&#13;
1/ A comparison of the final and draft amendments is contained in Annex 2&#13;
of the present papero&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
As of December 31 of each year all BOALs would have to calculate&#13;
their need for working capital, and so inform the SDK and the bank&#13;
providing investment credits. On the basis of this calculation the SDK&#13;
would be required to inform the bank in which said BOAL has its deposit&#13;
accounts and the assembly of the commune in which the BOAL is located of&#13;
the fact that the BOAL had not secured long-term sources of working capital&#13;
in the required amounts. The draft law provided that tne Federal Executive&#13;
Council shall prescribe the manner of calculating the working capital&#13;
requirements to be met from the organization's own resources and other&#13;
long-term sources of funding, as well as the deadlines for submitting tnis&#13;
calculation. Fines would be imposed on enterprises, including banks, who&#13;
violate the principal provisions of the law.l/&#13;
Interenterprise Credit&#13;
The Problem&#13;
The control of domestic credit and enterprise incomes depends&#13;
crucially on the disciplined behavior of the enterprise sector. The stock&#13;
of outstanding credit registered with the SDK that has accumulated outside&#13;
the banking system has reached very high levels and reportedly there has&#13;
been a significant increase in the value of claims which are not paid on&#13;
1/ The Law on Securing Working Capital was adopted in the Federal Executive&#13;
Council on May 14, 1984. This law is similar to draft law discussed&#13;
nere.&#13;

and services sold as of 31 December 19799 1980 and 1981 by inductrial&#13;
subsector and territory is provided in TaDles A 601-A 6.3 in tLbe&#13;
Statistical Appendix. A preliminary analysis of tnis data is g.ven below&#13;
after a review of the legal framework governing interenterprise Payments.&#13;
The rise in registered interenterprise claims was three times the rate of&#13;
inflation in 1981 and continued to increase faster than inflation in 1982&#13;
and 1983. These claims represent a significant source of credi4. allowing&#13;
enterprises to pursue more expansive wage and investment policies and/or to&#13;
operate more profitably than would have been the case in its absence. This&#13;
source of credit constitutes an addiLicnal softening of the budget&#13;
constraint facing Yugoslav firrms at a time when attempts are being made to&#13;
increase financial discipline.&#13;
The Legal Framwork as of April 1983&#13;
The legal framework governing interenterprise credit is the Law on&#13;
Securing Payments Among Users of Social Resources of December 1975 as&#13;
amended in April 1976 and April 19780l/&#13;
This law specifies that payment between users of social resources&#13;
may be secured in four waysg&#13;
1/  The Law was amended again in June 19830   See Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
(a) a check for immediate payment;&#13;
(b) an endorsed promissory note for payment within a period which&#13;
may not exceed 90 days from the date good are delivered or&#13;
services rendered;&#13;
(c) an irrevocable letter of credit if payment is effected on the&#13;
basis of documentation established in the contract concluded&#13;
between the debtor and the creditor; and&#13;
(d) a guarantee if payment is effected within a period which may&#13;
not exceed 30 days from the date goods are delivered or&#13;
services rendered, except in cases 1-3 above.&#13;
Guarantees are issued by enterprises, including banks, in their own name and&#13;
on their own account, except that banks may issues a guarantee for&#13;
investments in their own name, but upon authorization of one or more users&#13;
of social resources who then become liable if the guarantor cannot execute&#13;
the guarantee. Banks may also obtain "superguarantees" from other banks to&#13;
back up their own guarantees.&#13;
A guarantee or letter of credit must be provided to the seller on&#13;
or before the date goods are delivered or services rendered (this is called&#13;
the date of initiation of debtor-creditor relations in the law), and a check&#13;
or promissory note within 10 days of that date.&#13;
Letters of credit establish a separate account in the SDK which may&#13;
be drawn by the creditor upon presentation of documentation specified in the&#13;
letter. They are the safest form of payment from the creditor's point of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34 &#13;
view, since the SDK transfers existing funds from the issuing enterprise0s&#13;
giro account to a special account created for the purpose specified in the&#13;
letter. SDK will not open such an account if the funds are not available,&#13;
Letters of Credit therefore involve no net increase in the means of payment&#13;
and cannot be the object of collection on the basis of other obligations of&#13;
the debtor. Such special accounts can also be set up to secure payment by&#13;
check, but they are not obligatory. Promissory notes may be for up to 90&#13;
days and must be countersigned (in effect guaranteed) by ancther enterprise,&#13;
which can be a bank. As will be seen below, this involves tne creation of&#13;
new means of payment and therefore has implications for monetary policy.&#13;
Promissory notes, which are drawn on the debtor's SDK office, may&#13;
be endorsed by the creditor and used as a means of payment, or they may be&#13;
discounted at a bank or other social sector organization (user of social&#13;
resources) as provided by that organizatiorn's statutes0 The SDK pays the&#13;
holder of the promissory note on the maturity date, drawing on the issuer's&#13;
giro account. If the issuer's funds are insufficient to cover statutory&#13;
minimum personal income payments, then the SDK will issue an order to take&#13;
the required funds from the account of the countersigner, cherging the&#13;
account of the original issuer and registering it as an outstanding&#13;
obligation.   If the countersigner's funds are insufficient, the SDK submits&#13;
the promissory note to a court, informing the creditor, who may then take&#13;
legal recourse.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
The issue of a promissory note, then, creates a form of money&#13;
which, while backed by real goods and services, may circulate among&#13;
enterprises and be discounted and rediscounted (that is transformed into a&#13;
more broadly useable form of money, namely deposits in accounts at branches&#13;
of the SDK).&#13;
SDK statistics on the status of claims against purchasers for goods&#13;
and services sold show a category "claims for which payment date was&#13;
agreed." This category represents goods delivered and services rendered for&#13;
which no payment instrument has yet been transferred from the debtor to tne&#13;
creditor and no guarantee or letter of credit issued -- a status which in&#13;
April 1983 was legal for up to 10 days after the initiation of&#13;
debtor-creditor relations but illegal thereafter.&#13;
Recent Experience&#13;
Table 7 shows the aggregate value of outstanding claims at tne end&#13;
of the years 1979-83. A number of interesting facts emerge from a perusal&#13;
of this table. First is the predominance of promissory notes, which,&#13;
however, make up declining proportion of total interenterprise claims&#13;
outstanding over this five year period falling from 52.7X of the total&#13;
end-1979 to 43.3% at end-1983. Second is the rise in the percentage of&#13;
total claims accounted for by "claims for which payment date was agreed" in&#13;
1982 and 1983. The third is a clear increase in the percentage of claims&#13;
for which letters of credit and guarantees were received.&#13;

Developments through June 1983&#13;
As part of the stabilization program, the Yugoslav authorities seek&#13;
to tighten controls over interenterprise credit. The principal vehicle for&#13;
accomplishing this was a set of amendments to the 1975 Law on Securing&#13;
Payments Among Users of Social Resources which were passed in June 1984.&#13;
These amendments were being discussed in draft in April 1983. Among the&#13;
important changes introduced in the draft amendments were;&#13;
(a) a requirement that seller of goods and services must provide an&#13;
invoice or bill to the seller within eight (rather than ten)&#13;
days of the time the goods are delivered or services rendered,&#13;
likewise the purchaser must provide the seller a receipt within&#13;
the same eight day period;&#13;
(b) The purchaser would be allowed 15 days rather than 10 before he&#13;
would have to provide a check or promissory note to the seller&#13;
if he had not already provided a guarantee or letter of credit;&#13;
and he would not be allowed to provide a promissory note before&#13;
taking delivery;&#13;
(c) if the debtor does not deliver an instrument of payment within&#13;
the legal deadline, the creditor would have to report to the&#13;
SDK within 10 days of the deadline (i.e. a maximum of 25 days&#13;
after the goods are delivered or services rendered);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38 &#13;
(d) a debtor enterprise w-jhich did not effect payments on time would&#13;
be prohibited from paying personal incomes above the statutory&#13;
minimum for the republic or province in which it is based until&#13;
its payments position was regularized;&#13;
(e) after settlement of obligations on the basis of which he has&#13;
received a promissory notes a creditor would be allowed to&#13;
endorse it in favor of another enterprise as payment for goods&#13;
or services, repayment of a credit, downpayment required by a&#13;
contract, to discharge an obligation for pooling resources, as&#13;
a payment of interest, but not to grant credit to another&#13;
enterprise or to settle an obligation to a labor collective, or&#13;
he could discount the promissory note with a bank;&#13;
(f) the original issuer of a promissory note who acquires the note&#13;
prior to its due date could not endorse it to pay his own&#13;
obligations;&#13;
(g) discounting and rediscounting of promissory notes could be&#13;
performed only by banks, including internal banks of a work&#13;
organization;&#13;
(h) fines would be levied for illegal use of payments instruments&#13;
-- including payment by check or promissory note before&#13;
delivery of goods or performance of services or more than 15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
days later, if the debtor BOAL pays personal incomes above the&#13;
statutory minimum before regularizing its payments situation,&#13;
illegally discounts a promissory note, if a creditor does not&#13;
report the failure of a debtor to pay on time, etc.&#13;
The amendments to the Payments Law passed in June 1983 had minor&#13;
changes from the draft amendments. The differences are spelled out in Annex&#13;
3. It was expected that they would reduce the volume of "claims for which&#13;
payment date was agreed" to Din 50 billion by the end of 1984, but that has&#13;
not occurred -- the total was DY 314.9 at end-December 1983 and nad risen&#13;
again to DY 412.6 at end-Marcn 1984.&#13;
Amendments to the SDK law were also passed during 1983 which placed&#13;
that institution in a better position in terms of organizational structure&#13;
and authority to carry out the monitoring of inter-enterprise credit.&#13;
Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
The amendments to the Law on Rehabilitation and Liquidation of&#13;
Organizations of Associated Labor, the Law on Securing Payments among Users&#13;
of Social Resources, one the SDK law as well as the Law on Provision of&#13;
Working Assets of BOALs go a long way toward hardening the rather soft&#13;
budget constraint which has faced Yugoslav enterprises. The legislation&#13;
stepped up the economic pressure on these enterprises to increase their&#13;
efficiency and more broadly to achieve the objectives of the structural&#13;
adjustment program. It will be necessary, however, to mobilize the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
political will to enforce the new legislation. Clearly this is a major&#13;
challenge, given the laxity with which even the existing laws have been&#13;
enforced and the frequent intervention of SPCs, both in investment decisions&#13;
and the bailing-out of loss-makers. The interlocking system of banks,&#13;
enterprises, and SPCs has ensured that bankruptcy proceedings have been&#13;
instituted only exceptionally. To break out of this self-serving system of&#13;
rehabilitation proceedings, it is necessary that they be conducted by&#13;
independent bodies.&#13;
The SDK is the obvious candidate to perform this function. An&#13;
amendment to the Rehabilitation and Liquidation Law could provide the&#13;
necessary legal framework by requiring that the SDK or extsrnal consultants&#13;
licensed by the SDK participate actively in determine the caused of losses,&#13;
fixing responsibility for them, and developing rehabilitation programs,&#13;
including appraisal of any proposed investments for modernizing or expanding&#13;
productive capacity, which would have some minimum (positive in real terms)&#13;
economic rate of return to qualify for bank financing0 The SDK would have&#13;
to provide a written appraisal of rehabilitation programs which would have&#13;
to be attached before they could be sent to potential rehabiiitation&#13;
administrators.&#13;
If the SDK were to perform these functions it would have to be&#13;
strengthened, and this might require technical assistance, new hiring and/or&#13;
staff training0 There are a number of consultant groups, such as the&#13;
Institute for Industrial Economics in Belgrade, which have some exnerience&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
in this field and are interested in expanding their assistance to&#13;
enterprises in economic difficulty. Banks might also develop specialized&#13;
units for this purpose.&#13;
Banks could also increase the technical assistance component of&#13;
their loans and the stringency of conditionality for rehabilitation&#13;
programs. Even the founding member enterprises may look more critically at&#13;
new loans by their banks if there are less resources available from common&#13;
reserve funds and SPCs to help cover the losses. But the current ownership&#13;
structure for banks does tend to make them less selective in their lending&#13;
to member enterprises than would be the case for more independent banks.&#13;
The SDK has over 600 offices and an elaborate computer network, and&#13;
taus has the potential to collect, analyze, and act upon detailed BOAL-level&#13;
data and to aggregate this data as required for supervision at all levels of&#13;
tne federal system. It is not clear that this ability is fully utilized, or&#13;
that the capacity yet exists at the federal level to directly access and&#13;
aggregate data from the BOAL level on up simply by calling it up from a&#13;
central computer console. Yet in principle this could be done. As a&#13;
starter it would be helpful to collect and analyze quarterly data of ttne&#13;
kind contained in Tables A 2.1-A 2.3 of the Statistical Appendix,&#13;
disaggregated by four digit industrial subsectors for each republic and&#13;
autonomous province as well as for Yugoslavia. In order to monitor whether&#13;
personal incomes are actually being reduced in loss-making enterprises, data&#13;
on average monthly advances on personal incomes in enterprises showing&#13;
losses on their latest AFRs could be compared with that for all enterprises,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 &#13;
again by four digit industrial subsector and for each republic znd&#13;
autonomous province as well as for Yugoslavia. Use of BOAL level data and&#13;
multivariate analysis could help determine more precisely the&#13;
characteristics of loss-makers. Among the independent variables which might&#13;
'gexplain" loss-making are size of assets, number of workers, capital/labor&#13;
ratios, incremental capital-output ratios (ICORs), location (developed or&#13;
less-developed regions)9 and the presence of price controls on output0   It&#13;
would also be useful to see whether loss-making BOALs make great..er use of&#13;
promissory notes than do financially healthy enterprises.&#13;
There is a critical relationship between progress in eliminating&#13;
price distortions and enforcing greater financial discipline by phasing out&#13;
or greatly reducing the common reserve funds and other sources of covering&#13;
losses which are far removed from the enterprises. So long as controls hold&#13;
prices below economic levels, it will be necessary to provide some form of&#13;
subsidy to the programmed loss-makers. Eliminating price controls or at&#13;
least greatly reducing the number of products subject to them, as was&#13;
planned as of June 19839 is in most cases a necessary condition for ending&#13;
programmed losses. Another important tway to increase financial discipline&#13;
and promote efficient structural adjustment is to phase out interest rate&#13;
subsidies, including those for rehabilitation credits0 Enterprises should&#13;
face realistic prices for capital0&#13;
Finally, the whole question of interenterprise credit needs more&#13;
study0 Before any further measures are recommended in this arez it wjill be&#13;
necessary to look at quarterly or monthly data and better underotand the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
seasonal patterns and the mechanisms involved in the different modes of&#13;
payment. It will also be useful to see the impact of the new legislation&#13;
which should be on the books during the second half of 1983, and to&#13;
understand to what extent, if any, claims not registered with the SDK have&#13;
accumulated.&#13;

POSTCRIPT&#13;
The amendments to the Law on Rehabilitation and L.qu      :.cc of&#13;
OALs, to the Law on Securing Payments Between Users of Social Resources,&#13;
and to the SDK Law passed during 1983 strengthened the legal and&#13;
institutional framework for tightening financing discipline in Yuzgoslav&#13;
firms. In April 1984 two new federal laws were passed which provide&#13;
additional instruments for enforcing financing discipline.&#13;
The first new law limits payments out of Joint Reserve Funds&#13;
(there are over 500 such funds in Yugoslavia) so that cumulative quarterly&#13;
payments in 1983 can only exceed the level (during the same periods) in&#13;
1983 by 50% of the increase in the retail price index (lagged one&#13;
quarter). The second limits personal income payments by loss-making and&#13;
illiquid BOALs whether they were in profit- or loss-making work&#13;
organizations. The percentage increase in personal income payments by&#13;
loss-making enterprises is now limited to 50% of the growth in total&#13;
personal incomes per employee in the social sector of the relevant republic&#13;
or province, beginning March 1, 1984. A limited number of exceptions to&#13;
this provision are provided for, including electricity generation, coal&#13;
production, ferrous metals, fertilizer, and some foodstuffs production0 In&#13;
illiquid enterprises the same provisions becam¢ e£fective July 1D 1984D&#13;
with the same exceptions. The SDK is to monitor the provisions of the&#13;
law0 When an enterprise wishes to make payments of personal incomes it has&#13;
to sign a declaration that it does not have unpaid obligationso The SDK is&#13;
to check all personal income payments against a list of enterprices with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
payments arrears. A creditor enterprise must report twice a month to its&#13;
regional SDK the names of enterprises with unpaid obligations to it. The&#13;
SDK then must send copies of the report to the regional SDKs where these&#13;
debtor enterprises are situated, thus establishing the list of illiquid&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
Even stricter limitations on personal income payments by illiquid&#13;
enterprises were contained in the amendments of the Law on Securing&#13;
Payments Between Users of Social Resources passed in June 1983, but as of&#13;
April 1984 these provisions were expected to come into force only on&#13;
January 1, 1985. They would limit personal income payments by illiquid&#13;
enterprises to the nominal level paid in the previous year.&#13;

Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy of Loss-Making Enterprises&#13;
Legal Framework as of April 1983&#13;
The Law on Rehabilitation and Liquidation of Organizations of&#13;
Associated Labor of July 1980 provides the basic legal framework for&#13;
enterprise rehabilitation and bankruptcy. This law became effective on&#13;
December 31, 1980 and had been amended twice as of April 1983. The&#13;
following description of its provisions covers the law as amended through&#13;
April 1983. Annex 2 compares the Amendments enacted in June 1983 with&#13;
those available in draft in April 1983.&#13;
Rehabilitation. Three types of rehabilitation procedures of&#13;
progressively greater severity are provided for in this law, according to&#13;
the seriousness of an enterprise's financial situation. The proceedings&#13;
involved are explained in the following paragraphs.l/&#13;
1/ For more detail a translation of this law and its amendments is&#13;
available in the Yugoslavia division.&#13;

Technically the first two types of rehabilitation are called&#13;
"pre-rehabilitation" procedures. They cover (a) enterprises which9, while&#13;
not having shown a loss on a periodic (usually for a quarter other than for&#13;
January-March) financial report, are considered to have `busTness&#13;
difficulties" as defined by Art. 152 of the Associated Laboc Act 2/ and (b)&#13;
enterprises with losses on periodic financial reports but not yet having&#13;
shown a loss on an annual financial report.&#13;
In case (a) workers in the enterprise are required to adopt a&#13;
program of measures for removing the causes of business difficulties within&#13;
45 days of the time limit for submitting the quarterly financial report&#13;
(normally one month after the end of the quarter); inform of its&#13;
difficulties other BOALs with which it is linked by SMAsD the responsible&#13;
body of the SPC on whose territory it is based and self-managing communities&#13;
of interest toward which it has obligations to be met out of: its income; and&#13;
submit to them its program of measures0 The enterprise may request economic&#13;
and other assistance from all these sources, which are required to rev..ew&#13;
the program of measures and consider what assistance they w..ll render0 If&#13;
workers in a BOAL do not draw up a pre-rehabilitation program, or fail to&#13;
implement it, the management body of the BOAL or composite o.rganization of&#13;
associated labor within which it operates and the responsible body of the&#13;
2/ Art0 152 of the Associated Labor Act defines such enterprises as these&#13;
not able to secure resources for personal incomes as determined by SMAs,&#13;
or to secure investment resources as provided for by a SNA, or to ensure&#13;
the continuity of production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

SPC have the right and the duty to propose to the workers in the BOAL in&#13;
difficulty to adopt or implement such a program. If they do not do so&#13;
within 30 days of receiving such a proposal, the competent body of the SPC&#13;
must propose to the assembly of the SPC that it prescribe measures to&#13;
protect the social property entrusted to the BOAL.&#13;
In case (b) the workers of the BOAL must establish not only a&#13;
program of measures to remove the causes of the loss, but also determine the&#13;
causes of the loss and the responsibility, if any, of workers, management&#13;
bodies, and executive bodies for the loss incurred -- all within 45 days of&#13;
the date on which the periodic financial report must be submitted. The BOAL&#13;
must submit its program to remove the causes of the loss to the Social&#13;
Accounting Service (SDK) as well as to the same organizations as in case&#13;
(a). Otherwise the provisions are approximately the same as for case (a).&#13;
More formal rehabilitation procedures, for which statistics are&#13;
regularly reported by the SDK, apply to enterprises showing losses on their&#13;
annual financial reports, which are due by the end of February of the&#13;
following year.&#13;
Workers in a BOAL which declares a loss in its annual financial&#13;
report (AFR) are obliged, when adopting the report, to take a decision on&#13;
initiating rehabilitation proceedings which must specify:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 &#13;
ANNEX,a 1&#13;
Page 4 of 13&#13;
(a) the procedure and deadlines for establishing the causes of the&#13;
loss incurred;&#13;
(b) the deadlines for determining the responsibility, if any, of&#13;
individual workers, management bodies, and the eaecutive body&#13;
for the loss;&#13;
(c) the procedure and deadlines for adopting a rehabilitation&#13;
program; and&#13;
(d) other measures relevant to the rehabilitation procedure.&#13;
Within eight days of the adoption of the decision the BOAL must inform all&#13;
the organizations, including the SDK, required in the case of&#13;
pre-rehabilitation procedures, and also the court of registration0 If the&#13;
workers of the BOAL do not take the decisions required, the executive body&#13;
of the BOAL must notify the management bodies of the BOAL and other work&#13;
organizations within which it operates or with which it is associated, as&#13;
well as the appropriate agency of the SPC on whose territory it is based, of&#13;
the loss incurred and its size.&#13;
No later than July 1 of the year following that in which the loss&#13;
was incurred the BOAL must adopt a rehabilitation program which containsa&#13;
(a) the amount of the total loss and the amount of the loss not&#13;
covered by the reserve funds of the BOAL, the reserve funds or&#13;
net income of associated BOALs linked by a SMA cn the pooling&#13;

(b) the established causes of the loss, and the measures to be&#13;
taken for their removal;&#13;
(c) the method and deadlines for ensuring funds to cover the loss&#13;
and the terms under which those funds shall be obtained; and&#13;
(d) the duration of the rehabilitation program.&#13;
If the loss is due to obsolete technology, inadequate productive capacity,&#13;
shortage of working capital, or uneconomic business operations, the program&#13;
must also contain:&#13;
(a) a plan for the modernization, reconstruction and expansion of&#13;
facilities, the method of obtaining funds for that purpose and&#13;
the terms under which these funds will be obtained;&#13;
(b) the amount of working capital required, the method of obtaining&#13;
it and the terms under which it will be obtained; and&#13;
(c) measures to ensure rational economic business operations.&#13;

If the BOAL establishes a loss in the AFR which does not exceed the&#13;
planned amount of the loss in the adopted rehabilitation program providing&#13;
for a rehabilitation process of more than one year's duration, it is not&#13;
obliged to draw up a new rehabilitation program.&#13;
The BOAL must forward a copy of the rehabilitation program together&#13;
with a request for covering the loss not later than July 9 of the year&#13;
following that in which the loss was incurred to the followingz&#13;
(a) the BOALs with which it has signed a SMA on association to form&#13;
a work organization or composite organization;&#13;
(b) the BOALs with which it has signed a SMA on association of&#13;
labor and resources providing for joint liability and&#13;
risk-sharing as well as the covering of losses;&#13;
(c) the BOALs within the framework of the same work organization or&#13;
other BOALs with which it has generated more than half of its&#13;
total revenue declared in the AFR in which the uncovered loss&#13;
is shown;&#13;

The BOALs with which the BOAL incurring a loss have concluded a SMA&#13;
on the association of labor and resources providing for joint liability&#13;
risk-sharing and covering of losses or with which it has pooled its reserve&#13;
funds for covering losses shall, within a period of 30 days following&#13;
receipt of the rehabilitation program (that is by approximately August 8 of&#13;
the year following that in which the loss was incurred), take a decision on&#13;
covering the loss and cover the loss. In the rehaoilitation proceedings&#13;
funds shall be obtained at least up to the level of the uncovered loss.&#13;
If the BOAL does not adopt and submit a copy of the rehabilitation&#13;
program, the competent body of the SPC, together with the workers' council&#13;
or other management bodies of the BOAL, must propose a rehabilitation&#13;
program to the workers.   If the workers in the BOAL do not adopt a&#13;
rehabilitation program, the assembly of the SPC may intervene to protect tne&#13;
social property entrusted to the BOAL.   The competent body of tne SPC must&#13;
monitor the execution of the rehabilitation program.&#13;
In the rehabilitation proceedings funds must be obtained at least&#13;

repayment terms may not be shorter than the duration of the&#13;
rehabilitation programo&#13;
All actions taken in the course of rehabilitation proceedings must&#13;
be recorded in a special register kept by the competent SDK office. All&#13;
organizations providing funds to finance the rehabilitation program become&#13;
rehabilitation administrators. The rights and duties of rehabilitation&#13;
administrators and of the BOAL under rehabilitation must be specified in a&#13;
SMA on mutual relations under rehabilitation. If the loss-making BOAL does&#13;
not cover the loss and fails to find a rehabilitation adminiscrator within&#13;
the time limits established that is by approximately August 8 of the year&#13;
following that in which the loss was incurred, it must submit to the general&#13;
association with which it is associated, without delay, a proposal for&#13;
initiating rehabilitating with a view to finding the rehabilitation&#13;
administrator and shall inform the competent SDJK office of the same.&#13;
Immediately on receipt of this proposal, the general associati;on shall&#13;
invite all interested BOALs to initiate the rehabilitation asd shall inform&#13;
the Chamber of Economy of Yugoslaiva that the proposal to initiate the&#13;
rehabilitation has been accepted0 Tne potential rehabilitation&#13;
administrators must decide whether to take charge of the rehabilitation&#13;
within 30 days of receiving the proposal, and if the decision is positive,&#13;

must conclude a SMA rehabilitation within 40 days of the date on which a&#13;
proposal for administering rehabilitation is submitted by the loss-making&#13;
BOAL to the general association with which it is associated, that is by&#13;
approximately September 17 of the year following that in which the loss was&#13;
incurred. This SMA may envisage that the administrators participate in the&#13;
BOAL's decision making on the execution of the rehabilitation program.&#13;
The payment of advances on personal incomes in loss-making&#13;
enterprises from the deadline for filing the AFR until the adoption of a&#13;
decision to institute bankruptcy proceedings is currently governed by&#13;
republican and provincial laws.l/ The rehabilitation administrators and the&#13;
workers in the BOAL under rehabilitation must lay down, in the SMA on mutual&#13;
relations under rehabilitation, the basis and criteria for determining the&#13;
level of personal incomes for the duration of the rehabilitation program as&#13;
well as the method of coordinating positions and joint decision-making in&#13;
cases where the workers of the BOAL under rehabilitation do not act in&#13;
conformity with the obligations they assumed by that SMA.&#13;
1/ This provision was the result of an amendment to the 1980 law. The&#13;
mission did not obtain copies of the relevant republican and provincial&#13;
laws, but these reportedly mandate reducing personal income advances to&#13;
the guaranteed minimum (usually 70% of the republican or provincial&#13;
average for the previous year).&#13;

Within 30 days of the adoption of the AFR in unich an uncovered&#13;
loss is declared, the workers of the BOAL must initiate the prccedure for&#13;
establishing the responsibility for the loss of individual workters,&#13;
management bodies and the executive body. If the workers of the BOAL&#13;
establish the responsibility of any of these parties, steps must be taken to&#13;
appoint them to other posts and assignments, to recall them, replace them or&#13;
take other appropriate action0 The BOAL must inform the competent bodies of&#13;
the SPC and the SDK of the established causes of the loss incurred, the&#13;
responsibility of individual workers, management bodies or the executive&#13;
body and the actions taken to replace, recall or otherwise pun..sh them.&#13;
If no rehabilitation administrators are forthcoming within 30 days&#13;
after the general association receives a proposal to administer&#13;
rehabilitation (that is by approximately September 7 of tne year following&#13;
that in which the loss was incurred), consultations on a reduction of claims&#13;
must be initiated0 The proposal for starting such consultations must&#13;
contain-&#13;
(a) the amount of the loss to be covered through a Si4.A on reduction&#13;
of claims as well as the percentage offered credi.tors as&#13;
payment for their claims including proposed deadlines and&#13;
methods of payment of these claims;&#13;
(b) the amount of the uncovered loss upon the completion of the&#13;
rehabilitation proceedings;&#13;

(e) an indication of the amount to which the claims should be&#13;
reduced; and&#13;
(f) the total value of capital assets of the BOAL.&#13;
This proposal must be submitted to all creditors and tne competent body of&#13;
tne SPC of the territory on which the BOAL is based, inviting them to a&#13;
meeting on the reduction of claims by SMA.&#13;
The SMA on claims reduction may envisage the right of creditors&#13;
signing that agreement to participate in decision-making on the debtor's&#13;
legal affairs and may establish the level of workers' personal incomes in&#13;
the debtor BOAL for a period up to the execution of obligations assumed&#13;
under that SMA. A SMA on claims reduction is considered to have been&#13;
concluded if the creditors agree to reduce their claims to the level&#13;
required for covering the loss. Copies of the signed agreement must be&#13;
forwarded to the competent bodies of the SPC and to the SDK. If an&#13;
agreement is not reached within 30 days of initiating the consultations&#13;
(that is approximately by October 7 of the year following that in which the&#13;
loss was incurred), the BOAL must notify the competent body of the SPC and&#13;
the SDK. If the competent body of the SPC does not take steps under Art.&#13;

BOAL from taxes and contributions or reducing the sems, it shall initiate&#13;
bankruptcy proceedings.&#13;
Bankruptcy. Bankruptcy proceedings are executed by the competent&#13;
court on the territory where the debtor BOAL is based. Bodies involved in&#13;
such proceedings are a bankruptcy council (composed of three judges), the&#13;
bankruptcy judge, the administrator of enforced settlement or the bankruptcy&#13;
administrator, and a creditors' committee which can be formed at the request&#13;
of creditors whose claims exceed 50% of the total claims of all creditors0&#13;
Two outcomes of bankruptcy proceedings are possible0 The first is&#13;
an enforced settlement, which is an agreement between a debtor and at least&#13;
one half of the total number of creditors whose claims amount to more than&#13;
half of the total claims, if such a settlement is approved by the bankruptcy&#13;
council0 This normally involves a reduction in claims, is legally&#13;
enforceable, and does not result in the total liquidation of the BOALO The&#13;
second is bankruptcy proper, which resultc in termination of the employment&#13;
of the debtor BOAL's workers on the day the final bankruptcy proceedings are&#13;
initiated, unless otherwise determined by the bankruptcy council, in wfhich&#13;
case their incomes are determined by the bankruptcy council at the proposal&#13;
of the bankruptcy administrator0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Bankruptcy also results in the total liquidation of the BOAL,&#13;
the distribution of its assets to the various creditors, and its&#13;
elimination from the register of enterprises. If any assets are left over&#13;
after the regular liquidation proceedings, they are to be turned over to&#13;
the basic organizations associated within the same work organization as the&#13;
debtor, proportionately to the rights and obligations fixed under the SMA&#13;
on association.&#13;

Final Amendments (1983)                     Draft Amendments (1983)&#13;
Art. 18 Requires that the loss making BOAL&#13;
inform not just BOALs within its WO or COAL                --&#13;
with which it has a SMA but other BOALs as&#13;
well.&#13;
Art. 19 In addition to the possible exemptions       Lists the possibilities of&#13;
from obligations of loss making enterprises          exempting loss making BOALs&#13;
listed in the draft amendments, obligations           from obligations from taxes&#13;
arising from the pooling of resources based on        and other contributions.&#13;
SMAs on the plans of Communities of Interest in&#13;
material production in social activities are also&#13;
included.&#13;
Art. 32 Essentially as in draft amendment.   It       Less precise.&#13;
separates the competent organ of the republic&#13;
and the lending banks as two institutions to&#13;
be informed of the initiation of rehabilitation.&#13;
Art. 35 In addition to those listed in the Law,&#13;
the lending bank is also to be forwarded a copy             --&#13;
of the rehabilitation program by the BOAL.&#13;
Art. 37 As in the earlier amendment if the BOAL       Same except for last&#13;
cannot pay interest on credit and repay invest-       additions; i.e. possibility&#13;
ment credits, it can request the lending bank         of deferment and waiver of&#13;
to write off or defer the payment of interest        mandatory association of&#13;
or such credit; it could also request deferment       resources to the funds of&#13;

Unlike the earlier amendment, the lending bank        No time specified.&#13;
has to respond to this request and inform the&#13;
BOAL within 60 days of the receipt of the request.&#13;
The conditions and manner by which write off          Same as new law except for&#13;
and deferment of the above obligations are            absence of additional&#13;

Final Amendments                            Draft Amendments&#13;
Art. 38 Possible exemptions to Art. 31-37 are&#13;
made more precise. Thus a loss making&#13;
enterprise may not request rehabilitation&#13;
administors for funds to cover losses if&#13;
(i) the extent of such losses is no greater than&#13;
the amount allocated by the BOAL in the preceding&#13;
year to the business fund for the improvement of&#13;
the material base of labor and provided such losses&#13;
are covered from income in the following year0&#13;
(ii) if the extent of such loss does not exceed 50%&#13;
of the amortization in the year in which the loss&#13;
was incurred and provided losses will be covered&#13;
from the income in the following year0&#13;
In case the BOAL is not able to cover its&#13;
losses as described above, it must take all&#13;
necessary measures to cover its entire loss in&#13;
case (i) and at least 1/3 of the loss in case (ii).&#13;
Art0 50 The scope of the SMA between the loss         Same as final amendment0&#13;
making BOAL and the rehabilitation administrators&#13;
is widened to not only include the basis and cri--&#13;
teria for determining the level of personal incomes&#13;
for the duration of the rehabilitation but also to&#13;
participate in the preparation of production&#13;
programs; plans to employ surplus labor by&#13;
introducing additional work shifts, improving&#13;
capacity utilization and by transferring such&#13;
surplus labor to other BOALs in the WC or COAL0&#13;
The SMA would also allow for setting up a             Same0&#13;
committee of creditors-rehabilitation&#13;
administrators who would express opinions&#13;
and make proposals to the management of tne&#13;
loss making BOALO&#13;

must establish the cause of loss and individual&#13;
or collective responsibility and take&#13;
disciplinary measures. It should also inform&#13;
the SDK and the responsible agency of the SPCs.&#13;
Art. 53a This is an addition.   It provides for       Same.  But in addition to&#13;
the WO of which the loss making BOAL is part         informing the Assembly&#13;
to instruct the BOAL to take measures specified      it would recommend that&#13;
in Art. 53 and if not done it will imnediately        temporary measures of&#13;

Art. 64 This amendment strengthens the role of        In tne draft, the SDK&#13;
the SDK.  If the BOAL does not cover its loss        was authorized to file&#13;
or if it fails to conclude a SMA on reduction         a suit in court for&#13;
of the amount of its claims by a specific period,     instituting bankruptcy&#13;
the SDK will inform the SPC of its recommendation     proceedings and only&#13;
to initiate bankruptcy proceedings.   Tne SPC is      inform the SPC of this.&#13;
bound to respond to this and after examination        An exception was made for&#13;
to inform the SDK of its decision within 60          BOALS on railways, postal,&#13;
days.  If either the SPC fails to inform the SDK      telephone, telegraphs,&#13;
or if it informs that it would not initiate           electric power and coal&#13;
proceedings, the SDK is authorized to file an        management where the SDK&#13;
application for initiating bankruptcy proceedings     was to inform the SPCs&#13;
with the appropriate court.                           for the purpose of&#13;
ensuring that necessary&#13;
steps were taken; but it&#13;
could not file a suit in&#13;
court.&#13;
Art. 216 Specifies fine on the BOAL for not&#13;
initiating proceedings for the dismissal of&#13;
the Director, President and members of the&#13;
management, or for recall of delegates, or if&#13;
it fails to take disciplinary measures against&#13;
individual workers responsible for loss.&#13;
Art. 217 Imposes fines on the BOAL if it fails&#13;
to inform SPC, SDK of the causes of the losses&#13;
and the responsibility of workers/managers&#13;

b/ Information covers aounts of uncovered losses from current and earlier years. However, some deviations from the actual levels of uncovered losses&#13;
occured during the processing of data given in annual financial reports (AFR) for 1981 for the following reasons:&#13;
- AFR data analysis covers all users of social resources whose accounting records are kept according to the accounting plan for OALs (BOALs, WOs,&#13;
Working Cosunities, BOALs at foundation etc.), whereas SDK Information covers only AFR data of BOALs and WOs of econmic and non-economic&#13;
activities;&#13;
- AFR data analysis covers OALs wthose AFR were copleted on time, while the Information covers also those OALs whose AFRs were discovered to contain&#13;
uncovered losses through control procedures;&#13;
- even if the coverage were the same, differences could occur because of increased or decreased uncovered losses discovered through control procedures.&#13;

            Financial discipline and structural
            adjustment in Yugoslavia : rehabilitation and bankruptcy of
            loss - making enterprises
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Successful completion of
            Yugoslavia's structural adjustment program requires
            stricter financial discipline to increase the economic
            pressure on public enterprises to adjust. This paper focuses
            on two aspects of the general question of financial
            discipline: rehabilitation and bankruptcy of loss-making
            enterprises and inter-enterprise credit. In each case the
            nature of the problem, the present legal framework, recent
            experience, and expected future developments are reviewed.
            Although the bankruptcy and liquidation solution for
            loss-makers is well-defined in legislation, it has rarely
            been invoked. Procedures appear to provide insufficient
            pressure to induce real adjustment by firms. New legal
            measures have recently been enacted which should help
            involve Yugoslav enterprises to achieve the objectives of
            the country's structural adjustment program. But it
            will be necessary to mobilize the political will to enforce
            the new legislation and that previously in the books. The
            current system of rehabilitation proceedings is
            self-serving, whereas it needs to be conducted by an
            independent agency. Banks could also increase the technical
            assistance component of their loans and the stringency of
            conditionality for rehabilitation programs.
