on the proposed Loan (Business Environment Development Policy Loan) to Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) hereby&#13;
submits its report pursuant to Section 4 (iii) of Article III of said Articles in respect of the&#13;
proposal that the Bank grant to Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Borrower) a loan in an amount of&#13;
thirty-seven million four hundred thousand Euros (E37,400,000). The purpose of said loan is to&#13;
improve Bosnia and Herzegovina's business environment through facilitating business start-up,&#13;
streamlining investment procedures in inspections and construction, and simplifying processes of&#13;
cross-border trading.&#13;
1.    The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a loan, and&#13;
of the purpose to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the program in support of which the proceeds of&#13;
such loan are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in Article I of said&#13;
Articles of Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the development of the&#13;
productive facilities and resources of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is in the interest of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina and of the members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;
