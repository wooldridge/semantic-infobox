ABSTRACT&#13;
This report is part of an inquiry undertaken by the World Bank&#13;
in conjunction with scholars from 12 industrial countries into the&#13;
penetration of the markets of industrial countries by exports of&#13;
manufactures from developing countries. The project sought to establish&#13;
the shares of industrial country markets held by the developing&#13;
countries, changes in such shares in the 1970s, and why they vary among&#13;
industry groups and countries.   The aim is to assist developing and&#13;
industrial  countries  to  improve  their  policies  through  a  better&#13;
understanding of trade patterns and protectionist pressures.&#13;
To a great extent, protectionist behavior is industry-specific,&#13;
with several factors relevant in determining an industry's attitude&#13;
toward protection.   Among  them are the intensity and nature of the&#13;
competition it faces, its adjustment options and capacity to adjust, and&#13;
its success  in lobbying  the government for protection.   This paper&#13;
analyzes these factors for four quite different industries in Great&#13;
Britain:   footwear, knitwear, cutlery and consumer electronics.   Each&#13;
has faced substantial import competition from developing countries and&#13;
has received varying degrees of protection that in all cases have been&#13;
higher than the U.K. average for manufacturing. The paper also looks at&#13;
the factors that may determine whether the government adopts a&#13;
protectionist policy, with specific attention to the four industries.&#13;
The study showed that the effect of the import competition&#13;
across industries and within each industry varied substantially.   Some&#13;
branches and/or firms did well, others did not.   It also showed that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
many of the common assumptions about the nature of the competition were&#13;
ill-founded. For example, the competition derived from a few, not the&#13;
majority, of developing countries. Differentials in labor availability&#13;
and costs were only two, and not necessarily the key, factors affecting&#13;
Great  Britain's  competitiveness.    Others  were  that  plants  in  the&#13;
developing countries were often larger and more modern, enhancing&#13;
efficiency and providing scale economies; input costs were lower and&#13;
there was less waste;  and labor overhead was lower.   As a result,&#13;
production costs were substantially lower.&#13;
Equally important, government policies in Britain and industry&#13;
responses to competition have all too often been inappropriate and&#13;
unsuccessful.    This  is  particularly  true  in  terms  of the  use  of&#13;
protectionism to counter competition. All four industries in fact have&#13;
had a number of adjustment options to choose from.  Broadly, they fall&#13;
into  two  categories:    product  (or horizontal)  diversification,  and&#13;
product (or vertical) specialization.  In general, the industries have&#13;
not pursued these options (with some notable exceptions) and have&#13;
resorted, instead, to requests for protection.&#13;
As noted, the four industries studied here have received&#13;
substantial protection.   Two explanations are generally forwarded for&#13;
the  government's  policy:    the  pluralist  model  and  the corporatist&#13;
model.   In the case of the four industries studied here, the latter&#13;
model is more relevant. However, other important factors must also be&#13;
taken into account, such as the external pressures on government (the EC&#13;
and  other   trade  partners)   and   its  ideology  (free  trade  vs.&#13;
protectionism).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Where protection is provided, two rationales are often given.&#13;
The first -- the modified infant industry rationale -- is rarely&#13;
justified.   The second -- the need  to minimize  the costs of rapid&#13;
adjustment -- is more understandable.   However, government assistance&#13;
should not result, as it has in Britain, in the addition of resources or&#13;
capacity to a non-competitive industry.  Rather, it should further the&#13;
industry's diversification or help it close down more slowly.&#13;
Government should also remove those trade restrictions that&#13;
reduce an industry's adjustment options and make change more difficult&#13;
to implement. Finally, the role that Britain's overvalued exchange rate&#13;
has played in discouraging major structural adjustments must be noted.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
Some industries have proven more vulnerable to shifts in&#13;
international competitiveness and more adaptive or more prone to&#13;
protectionist pressures than others. To some extent, the reasons can be&#13;
related to general principles. Nevertheless, a substantial part of the&#13;
dynamics of adjustment or protectionist behavior is industry-specific&#13;
and can be properly understood only through the detailed study of&#13;
individual  industries  and  the  firms  within  them.    For  specific&#13;
industries, the intensity of the pressures resulting from competitive&#13;
imports will depend not only on underlying factors such as comparative&#13;
advantage, but also on other determinants of competitiveness.   These&#13;
include different productivity levels stemming from different vintages&#13;
of machinery and levels of managerial competence; the degree to which&#13;
technical knowledge is internationally diffuse; differences in the&#13;
prices of inputs, especially those that are non-traded; the movement of&#13;
exchange rates; and the structure of distribution at the wholesale and&#13;
retail levels.&#13;
Whether firms in an industry will try to resist competition by&#13;
seeking protection or will adjust to market forces will also depend on&#13;
the  options  available:       for  new  or  specialized  products,   for&#13;
multinational investment or for new technology with different production&#13;
methods.   In addition, for a given array of options, industries will&#13;
differ in their capacity to adjust.  In some cases their capacity will&#13;
be low: the firms may be small and have limited financial resources;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the work force may be concentrated in a high unemployment area and&#13;
resist   change;   or   management   may   be   highly   specialized   and&#13;
conservative.   Where there is resistance to market-related solutions,&#13;
there will be differences in the ability of industries to mobilize this&#13;
resistance and to influence decision-makers.&#13;
In  this  paper,   these  questions  are  pursued  through  a&#13;
comparative case study approach involving four British industries:&#13;
footwear, cutlery, consumer electronics and knitwear.&#13;
The Case Studies&#13;
The main criterion in the choice of the cfse studies was to&#13;
identify industries with a common experience of competing imports from&#13;
developing -- or "newly industrializing" -- countries (NICs),I/ but with&#13;
different  characteristics  and  different  histories   of  government&#13;
policy. Textiles and clothing was an obvious starting point. However,&#13;
a decision was made to look at only one component part, knitwear. It is&#13;
a branch of manufacturing with a distinct identity -- in terms of&#13;
technology, geography, unioniziation and manufacturers' association --&#13;
yet, in other respects, it is an integral part of the larger textiles&#13;
family.    The  knitwear  industry  extends  vertically  from  "upstream"&#13;
textile activities which mainly use manmade fibers to "downstream"&#13;
1/   The  newly  industrializing  countries  are  variously  defined  in&#13;
different contexts.  For example, they may be countries which are&#13;
increasing their industrial capacity or which are increasing their&#13;
exports of manufactures.   A number of international institutions&#13;
have specific definitions for this group or only include some&#13;
countries.  In this volume, any of the various definitions may be&#13;
relevant.&#13;

garment assembly, the latter being the one of the greatest areas of&#13;
competition from the developing countries.&#13;
The footwear industry has also been in the forefront of current&#13;
arguments about trade protection in Britain and elsewhere. It was worth&#13;
an individual look to establish whether the consequences of its being a&#13;
relatively small industry (63,000 workers in Great Britain at the end of&#13;
1980, in relation to 710,000 in textiles and clothing) have been&#13;
significant.   It is also an industry (unlike textiles and clothing) in&#13;
which the "downstream" assembly operations predominate in economic and&#13;
political importance over the "upstream" intermediatelprocesses (in this&#13;
case, leather tanning).&#13;
The third choice was of a quite different industry -- consumer&#13;
electronics. Developing countries have made substantial inroads in the&#13;
world trade of these products.   This phenomenon is less explicable in&#13;
terms of traditional trade theory and rmore explicable in terms of the&#13;
"product cycle" concept and asWociated ideas.l/ The industry has been&#13;
characterized by the rapid pace and extent of product innovation, and&#13;
also by its strongly transitional character, with many important firms&#13;
having overseas interests or ownership.&#13;
The fourth choice was cutlery, a tiny industry employing a few&#13;
thousand people, but one with a lively and complex history of lobbying&#13;
for protection.   It is also interesting as the first of what may prove&#13;
to be a succession of metal-working industries (others being hand tools,&#13;
1/   The theory is set out in R. Vernon, "International Investment and&#13;
International Trade in the Product Cycle," Quarterly Journal of&#13;
Economics 80(May 1966):190-207.&#13;

metal fasteners and metal hollow-ware) in which developing countries,&#13;
especially those able to produce or acquire cheap steel, are becoming&#13;
competitive.&#13;
Each of the four industries has enjoyed some protection, though&#13;
in varying degrees.   Except for leather shoes, tariffs have been well&#13;
above the EC's average Common External Tariff, and in each case, the&#13;
industries have been shielded from the tariff cuts of the Tokyo Round.&#13;
Although the effective rate of tariff protectioi is difficult to&#13;
compute, it has varied from approximately 10 percent on leather footwear&#13;
to just over 30 percent on cutlery and knitwear (there are various&#13;
additional imposts as well, such as an 8 percent anti-dumping duty on&#13;
Brazilian leather shoes, the main developing country source for that&#13;
product).   Most  products have also been  "sensitive" under the EC's&#13;
Generalised System of Preferences, which permits only a little duty-free&#13;
market  access.    Of  the  four  industries,  cutlery  has  been  less&#13;
"sensitive," and there has been some flexibility in the treatment of&#13;
consumer electronics.&#13;
Quantitative    restrictions    have    provided    additional&#13;
protection.   Industry-to-industry voluntary export restrictions (VERs)&#13;
are normally the weakest form of restraint, and the cutlery industry has&#13;
operated within this framework, with Japan and the Republic of Korea&#13;
(South Korea) having been refused formal import controls. The consumer&#13;
electronics  industry  also  relies  upon  voluntary  restraints  for&#13;
monochrome TVs and music centers from South Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan&#13;
and Singapore, as well as for Japanese color TVs.  In this case, the&#13;
agreements  had been precipitated -- indeed  forced -- by  the prior&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
unilateral import quotas.   The industry has also been protected by a&#13;
licensing system which has prevented Asian non-licensees from exporting&#13;
larger TVs -- above 20 inches -- to Britain and Europe.  Trade in the&#13;
main radio items and small TVs has, however, been unrestricted.&#13;
A similar patchwork quilt of voluntary restraints on some items&#13;
and limited use of import quotas and free trade on others also describes&#13;
the footwear industry.&#13;
From the point of view of the industry being protected, one of&#13;
the major weaknesses of the kind of regime that has been operating in&#13;
footwear and consumer electronics (and more weakly in cutlery) is that&#13;
it has not been comprehensive.  The Multi-Fibre Arrangement  (MFA) for&#13;
textiles which covers the knitting industry represents a much more&#13;
comprehensive approach to prottction.  It has evolved to cover all the&#13;
major product categories and all the major (and most minor) "low cost"&#13;
suppliers in a network of bilaterally negotiated quotas which are&#13;
normally "voluntary" but which are strictly enforced by the governments&#13;
of the importing countries.&#13;

Chapter II&#13;
IMPORT COMPETITION AND THE PRESSURE TO ADJUST&#13;
The popularization of the idea of "comparative advantage" has&#13;
often  led  to  the  impression  that  whole  industri s  are  doomed  to&#13;
disappear  (or  have  actually  disappeared)  because  of  "low  cost"&#13;
imports. In each of the cases considered here, reality has been a great&#13;
deal more complex.   Import competition from developing countries has&#13;
been much stronger in some branches of the industries than others and&#13;
non-existent elsewhere (see Table 1).  Moreover, there have been other&#13;
factors besides low-cost imports creating pressures for adjustment:&#13;
technological change, competition from other products, declining demand&#13;
and competition from countries besides the developing ones.&#13;
Import Penetration&#13;
Overall, the level of import penetration in British footwear&#13;
almost doubled in terms of value between 1972 and 1979, reaching a level&#13;
of 36 percent.   In terms of volume,  the level was 46 percent.   This&#13;
competition has exerted pressures on the industries to adjust:   while&#13;
the imports were rising in volume throughout the 1970s, production was&#13;
falling (there was no growth in domestic demand, and exports were&#13;
static). In 1979, production (149.6 million pairs) was well below that&#13;
of a decade earlier (194.1 million pairs), a phenomenon observed in most&#13;
other OECD countries.&#13;
At first sight, the developing countries would appear to have&#13;
been a major source of the problem. The demand for textile footwear has&#13;
been met almost entirely by imports from developing countries (the&#13;
volume has been over 80 percent), while rubber and plastic footwear has&#13;

also faced relatively high import penetration.   On the other hand, in&#13;
leather footwear production, which has been the mainstay of British&#13;
footwear manufacturers, the developing countries have taken over only 6&#13;
percent  of  the British market  in  terms  of volume  and value.   As&#13;
competitors, the developing countries have been overshadowed by Italy,&#13;
Spain and the COMECON countries.   In fact, when looking at footwear&#13;
imports as a whole, a striking feature is the decline in the share of&#13;
developing  countries in terms of both volume and value.   In volume&#13;
terms, developing countries have recently been running at a lower level&#13;
than in the early 1970s.&#13;
Part of the explanation lies in the more favorable conditions&#13;
of market access for European suppliers.  Still, it is significant that&#13;
two developing countries have been able to capture some of the leather&#13;
footwear market. While low unit value and non-leather footwear imports&#13;
from Hong Kong, India and Malaysia have declined, imports of high unit&#13;
value leather footwear from South Korea and Brazil have grown. In fact,&#13;
the latter two have succeeded in providing goods competitive in quality&#13;
and price in the main leather footwear market.&#13;
This picture of the nature of competition from developing&#13;
countries -- of concentration in only some product lines and originating&#13;
in a small number of middle-income countries -- has been duplicated&#13;
exactly in the knitwear industry (although here the extent of the quota&#13;
regulations has made interpretation of the trade, trends difficult).&#13;
Import competition from developing countries has been negligible in one&#13;
category -- fabrics. In fact, British knitting firms export fabrics to&#13;
Brazil and South Korea. The other branches in which import competition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
from developing countries has been of modest importance are socks,&#13;
ladies' stockings, tights and underwear.   The industry has had fears,&#13;
however, that the main developing country suppliers, which already&#13;
export acrylic socks, will soon perfect the technique of incorporating&#13;
satisfactory heels.   Further, while developing countries have not yet&#13;
had any sizable impact on the market for tights, competition from Italy&#13;
has been severe.&#13;
So far, the competition has been concentrated in three areas:&#13;
gloves, knitted shirts and outerwear.   In the 1960s, Britain lost its&#13;
glove market almost in entirety to suppliers from Hong Kong. The glove&#13;
industry has virtually disappeared (though there is still some limited&#13;
production of high quality leather gloves for export).&#13;
The other two major product areas in which import penetration&#13;
increased markedly in the 1970s are knitted shirts and outerwear&#13;
(jerseys, pullovers and dresses). The outerwear sector alone accounted&#13;
for over 40 percent of Britain's market for knitted goods, and here the&#13;
developing countries have accounted for approximately 75 percent of the&#13;
value of imports and 28 percent of the British market.   Among the&#13;
developing countries, three Far Eastern newly industrializing economies&#13;
have predominated: Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, China.&#13;
In cutlery, the adjustment pressures from developing countries&#13;
have been specific to one part of the industry -- domestic stainless&#13;
steel cutlery (knives, forks, spoons) -- and to virtually one supplier,&#13;
South Korea.   Included in the stainless steel cutlery imports from&#13;
developing countries have been blanks for silverplating in England.&#13;
These imports have been taking place for at least 20 years, originally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
coming from Europe and Japan, then in the sixties from Hong Kong, and&#13;
lately from South Korea, which has been accounting for over 50 percent&#13;
of the volume of imports.&#13;
This category of goods is but a small part of a complex of&#13;
industrial activities which includes cutlery for industrial use, razor&#13;
blades, metal hollow-ware and domestic cutlery of precious metals,&#13;
silver gilt or chromium plate, as well as stainless steel. Thus imports&#13;
from developing countries have been a negligible issue so far.&#13;
The import competition in consumer electronics, much of it from&#13;
the Far Eastern NICs and Japan, has gone farther and faster than in the&#13;
other three industries taken as a whole.  Except for color television,&#13;
which to now has been protected by outstanding patents, import&#13;
penetration has exceeded 50 percent in all of the other branches of the&#13;
industry. Several have virtually disappeared.&#13;
The transformation is perhaps illustrated most dramatically by&#13;
the radio industry. In 1979, over 14 million radios and units of audio&#13;
were sold in Britain, of which 96 percent were imported.  In 1969, 1.7&#13;
million were sold, of which only 3 percent were imported.&#13;
The importance of developing countries has varied considerably&#13;
among the product categories.   In the more standardized items in the&#13;
"mature" phase of the product cycle (portable radios, black and white&#13;
TVs, the more simple music centers, car radios and cassette and tape&#13;
recorders) and in products that involve slight modifications of these&#13;
(clock radios), competition has come largely from the Asian NICs and&#13;
increasingly from the poorer developing countries such as Malaysia&#13;
(radios) and Thailand (black and white TVs). A second category of goods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
is comprised of items closer to the "growth" or innovative phase of&#13;
development  --  color  TVs,  hi-fi  equipment,  video  recorders,  car&#13;
radios/cassette combinations and sophisticated music centers. The main&#13;
competition has been Japan. However, such is the speed of the diffusion&#13;
of technical knowledge that the NICs are also competing in "new"&#13;
products and already dominate some markets, such as that for electronic&#13;
games.&#13;
To summarize,  several general  tendencies are clear.   First,&#13;
reflecting the complex and diverse nature of the industries themselves,&#13;
the experience with import competition has varied greatly. Some rather&#13;
small industrial branches have almost been wiped out by competition from&#13;
developing  countries:    gloves,  portable  radios,  shoes with  textile&#13;
uppers and stainless steel tableware.  Yet, even here, some firms have&#13;
flourished, while the competition has scarcely touched other branches of&#13;
the industries.   Second, in all four industries, it has been a small&#13;
group of NIC competitors rather than the developing countries generally&#13;
which have predominated.   Among these, the traditional major supplier&#13;
has been Hong Kong, which, however, has lost ground to South Korea in&#13;
particular.    Among  the  poorer  countries,  India  and  Pakistan  have&#13;
maintained a small but diminishing niche at the bottom of the footwear&#13;
and knitwear markets, while Malaysia (non-leather shoes and radios) and&#13;
Thailand (TV and knitwear) have accounted for a modest market share.&#13;
Thus, the full extent of a comparative advantage based on low wage costs&#13;
has yet to reveal itself except on a very narrow front in terms of&#13;
countries and products.  Third, there is some evidence that the shares&#13;
of developing countries' imports overall, as well as in the British&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -       I&#13;
market, for some important product categories have actually declined:&#13;
for footwear generally, for monochrome TVs and for major knitwear&#13;
items.   Protection has played a part, combined with the unrestricted&#13;
access that EC exporters have to the British market.  However, another&#13;
factor is probably that wage costs are merely one of a variety of price&#13;
and  non-price  considerations  that determine competitiveness.   It is&#13;
these other considerations that are the subject of the next section.&#13;
Competitiveness and Comparative Advantage&#13;
There  is  good  empirical  evidence  that  the  pattern  of&#13;
manufacturing trade between developed and developing countries can be&#13;
broadly explained in terms of factor endowments, at least when the&#13;
factors are defined to include "human capital" (skill and innovative&#13;
capacity).!/     Beyond  that,  however,  are  other  substantial  and&#13;
unexplained elements.&#13;
At  first  sight,  each  of  the  four  industries  fits  the&#13;
characteristics of the "labor-intensive," low "human capital" industries&#13;
in which developing countries could have a comparative advantage. From&#13;
Table 2, it can be seen that the four industries have a gross output per&#13;
employee, value-added per person and fixed capital per person well below&#13;
the manufacturing average. Also striking is the high share of women in&#13;
the labor force, reaching 84 percent in garments. Only in footwear (and&#13;
leather) is the share of women (29 percent) close to the average for the&#13;
manufacturing industry as a whole (29 percent). Three factors are both&#13;

the causes and effects of these relatively large numbers of women&#13;
workers: the lower wages generally paid to women (about 70 percent of&#13;
the rate for men); the lack of technical skills associated with&#13;
employees who turn over rapidly, especially married women; and the&#13;
willingness of women to work part-time when market conditions require&#13;
it. The large share of women workers, and the relatively low wages paid&#13;
to men as well, have depressed average earnings in all the industries&#13;
studied to well below those in manufacturing as a whole.&#13;
The same conclusion can also be drawn from other proxies that&#13;
can be used to measure "human capital":  the share of manual workers in&#13;
the labor force; the share of professionally qualified staff; and&#13;
expenditures on R&amp;D (though, in this case, consumer electronics is&#13;
exceptional).&#13;
This picture is, however, not the whole st?ry. Absolute price&#13;
differences between British goods and the landed costs of competing --&#13;
and what seem to be identical -- imports from developing countries have&#13;
often been substantially greater than can be explained satisfactorily in&#13;
terms of the differences in the wage rates for the unskilled. The share&#13;
of manual wages in the total ex-factory sales price in Britain has been&#13;
close to 20 percent for each of the industries and around 30 percent for&#13;
all labor costs (though the labor cost percentage may be higher for&#13;
particular  categories  of  subproducts,  and  inputs  also have a labor&#13;
content).   By contrast, material inputs accounted for 50 percent or&#13;
more.  Price differentials may also have arisen from material inputs not&#13;
being charged at international prices.   It has, for example, been a&#13;
contention of British cutlers that their South Korean competitors have&#13;

had access  to exceptionally cheap steel.   They claim that  l ton of&#13;
finished (cutlery) pieces from South Korea fetches the same price as 1&#13;
ton of unprocessed European steel and that the prices paid by South&#13;
Korean and Japanese makers for stainless steel sheet and coil are&#13;
approximately one-half that of European prices.l/  Allegedly, hot band&#13;
and some flatwear steel is provided by Japanese companies to their&#13;
subsidiaries -- or to South Korean firms -- at below cost.&#13;
Closer inspection shows that this claim has questionable&#13;
validity.   Japanese -- and the new South Korean           steel plants are&#13;
genuinely  among  the  world's  most  efficient.    The  European  price,&#13;
moreover,  is  sustained  by  cartelization.    The  South  Koreans  also&#13;
economize on steel by using their relatively low-cost labor to gather up&#13;
waste steel after the blanks are cut from the steel sheet, whereas a&#13;
British cutlery plant can "lose" over a third of its steel by not saving&#13;
waste.    South  Korean  and  Japanese  firms  also  salvage  scrap  more&#13;
generally, unlike British firms. Finally, South Korean cutlery steel is&#13;
somewhat lower in quality -- the chromium and nickel content is a little&#13;
less, and the product is more inclined to rust. Hence, it is cheaper.&#13;
A  similar  set  of  factors  helps  explain  the  Far  East's&#13;
competitiveness in knitwear:   there are cost savings in the garment-&#13;
making process not only in terms of direct labor, but also through the&#13;
use of cheaper  acrylic  yarns;  the  availability  in  the  Far East of&#13;
manmade fibers at a discount, relative to European fiber prices; and&#13;
material savings in the knitting mills.&#13;

Perhaps the most important case in which material input costs&#13;
may be decisive involves leather footwear.  Brazil has been criticized&#13;
not only for imposing "a ban on hide exports which normally allows their&#13;
tanners material at prices well below world market levels," but there&#13;
is also "a tax on the export of leather which means that Brazil keeps&#13;
for herself the leather price advantage arising from cheap hides."I/ By&#13;
the end of 1978, according to one group, British tanners were paying&#13;
three times the price that tanners in the main exporting developing&#13;
countries were paying for their hides 2/  On the other hand, the other&#13;
major developing country leather footwear exporter, South Korea, has not&#13;
been using domestic hides, although it does enjoy relatively cheap&#13;
leather, a product of modern, highl productivity (and low wage)&#13;
tanneries.                      I&#13;
In the final case study, consumer electronics, the question of&#13;
material input costs arises again but in a different way. The costs for&#13;
TV assembly derived for the National Economic Development Office (NEDO)&#13;
showed that European costs were 30 to 35 percent greater than in Japan&#13;
or South Korea.!/ By far the most important reason -- especially in the&#13;
case of Japan, but also of South Korea -- lay in the relative cheapness&#13;

and better quality of Asian components.   Cost advantages were being&#13;
obtained through the large size of the factory units producing the&#13;
components, through sophisticated managerial control systems, through&#13;
substantial investments of a labor-saving character and through the use&#13;
of the most advanced integrated circuit technology.&#13;
These factors suggest that a simple version of "comparative&#13;
advantage"   is   inadequate   by   it$elf   to   explain  the   relative&#13;
competitiveness   of   industries   and   countries.          Nevertheless,&#13;
differentials in labor availability -- and labor costs -- are still&#13;
important not just directly, but also indirectly in ancillary functions&#13;
such as waste collection or in supplying industries such as tanning.&#13;
The "comparative advantage" of producers with low labor costs is also&#13;
expressed through lower overheads, including for labor conditions,&#13;
rather than just through wages. Far Eastern (and Italian) manufacturers&#13;
often do not have to obey rigid regulations on working conditions or to&#13;
pay social security taxes.  Employees tend not to benefit from holiday&#13;
and sick benefits, and floor space productivity is raised by reducing&#13;
the safety margins for operating and by cutting back on rest rooms. In&#13;
many instances, office workers' are family and are therefore probably&#13;
unpaid except to cover subsistence needs.  More important, overhead is&#13;
reduced by long working hours, especially by working shifts,  so that&#13;
machines are kept operating continuously.  The average working week in&#13;
South Korea is 55 hours for clothing workers, a schedule which reduces&#13;
the incidence of overhead considerably -- by an estimated 30-40&#13;
percent -- with a net impact on the ex-factor cost of around 12 percent.&#13;

Chapter III&#13;
REVERSING COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE&#13;
Critical to the issue of how industries respond to competition&#13;
and how governments respond to requests for protection is the extent to&#13;
which the lack of competitiveness can be reversed or is imagined to be&#13;
reversible.   In large part,  that reversal will require changing the&#13;
techniques of production so that the comparative advantage is changed.&#13;
The possibility of using automated, capital-intensive methods is central&#13;
to the discussions about the future of the consumer electronics and&#13;
cutlery industries and, to a lesser degree, of the others, just as it&#13;
has been in two other industries -- jute and cotton textiles --&#13;
threatened by "low cost" import competition.&#13;
Current Efforts by Industry&#13;
Consumer Electronics&#13;
British consumer electronics manufacturers concede that, to a&#13;
degree, the "product cycle" should be allowed to run its course and that&#13;
standardized labor-intensive assembly operations "are more suitable to&#13;
the low cost labor industries."L/ However, they have resisted extending&#13;
that principle to color TVs, their last remaining major product.   The&#13;
main TV firms and trade unions have instead agreed on a strategy for the&#13;
industry: to make it internationally competitive by achieving economies&#13;

of scale through consolidation into larger plants owned by fewer&#13;
companies and by increasing the use of advanced Japanese technology and&#13;
mass production methods. The mechanism is investment by the Japanese or&#13;
the installation of sophisticated, automatic insertion machinery by nonr-&#13;
Japanese companies.   It is hoped that subsequently the plants can be&#13;
used for new products such as video tape recorders.   Trade protection&#13;
has not been an explicit government commitment, though it has been&#13;
accepted that the process wilt require "the maintenance of the present&#13;
network of import restraints through the reconstruction phase.'-'Y This&#13;
phase is usually defined as four to five years, or to 1985.&#13;
The program of investment is already well-advanced. Thorn-EMI,&#13;
the largest firm, has closed one of its three main factories and has&#13;
invested heavily in an automated production line for a new range of sets&#13;
based on a versatile single-board (TV) chassis.   As a result, and with&#13;
union cooperation, it has halved its labor force in three years, cut the&#13;
labor time to make one set from six to three hours and reduced the&#13;
number of components by a third.&#13;
Philips, the other major non-Japanese maker, has consolidated&#13;
its production into one plant and has noted that "it now takes over two&#13;
man hours to make a TV set against ten man hours six years ago. At the&#13;
same time the number of components has been halved.42/&#13;

Finally,  another  five  (and  shortly  to  be  six)  Japanese&#13;
companies have built plants using automated methods, as has one from&#13;
Taiwan, China; all invested in Britain to "Jump" the barriers to the&#13;
British (and EC) markets created by the patent restrictions, quotas and&#13;
tariffs on imports.&#13;
At first sight, the egercise has been a success. The industry&#13;
is no longer relatively labor-intensive. It has been exporting, as well&#13;
as reclaiming the home market (the Sony plant was recently awarded the&#13;
Queen's Award for Export, while its Japanese manager received the Order&#13;
of the British Empire, or OBE).  At the same time, however, generally&#13;
the plants are still small by world standards (almost a dozen produce&#13;
just over 2 million sets a year, although the optimum size of a single&#13;
plant is 1 million per year).  It is likely that, without protection,&#13;
the British plants will continue to be uncompetitive with those of South&#13;
Korea and Taiwan, China and with Japanese subsidiaries in the ASEAN&#13;
countries, as these will be combining low labor costs with the latest&#13;
equipment and a very large plant size.   Further,  so far Britain is&#13;
developing new products only on a small scale.&#13;
Cutlery&#13;
In the cutlery industry, automation is certainly technically&#13;
feasible. Ironically, however, the British industry has been unable to&#13;
compete with the factories in one developing country (South Korea),&#13;
whose plants are larger and newer than almost any in Britain and are&#13;
geared mainly to automated mass production. It is even more ironic that&#13;
Britain's industry has retained a comparative advantage in some of the&#13;
most labor-intensive activities: designing, polishing and inspecting a&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

wide range of specialized items, especially in high quality, low volume&#13;
lines in which the South Koreans have not tried to compete.&#13;
Some firms, including the largest, Viners, have tried to retain&#13;
the main market.   In the early 1970s, Viners invested heavily in new&#13;
equipment,  expanding  capacity,  simplifying  its  product  range  and&#13;
remodelling its factories to a production line basis rather than leaving&#13;
them as independent workshops.-   Even before 1970 it had a computer-&#13;
controlled warehouse and electroplating plant, as well as other advanced&#13;
equipment.&#13;
After an initial period of high market and profit growth, the&#13;
company was unable to generate the profits needed to pay for the higher&#13;
interest charges and, under a threat of liquidation, was recently taken&#13;
over.&#13;
Footwear and Knitwear&#13;
Both the footwear and knitwear industries (the latter at least&#13;
in its garment-making aspects) have much more limited options.   The&#13;
footwear industry has always been characterized by short production runs&#13;
and "batch" rather than mass production methods.   While there is some&#13;
hope  of,  for  example,   computer-controlled   patterning,   automatic&#13;
stitching and more efficient transfers from one process to another, the&#13;
manufacturers have frankly acknowledged the limitations:   "we do not&#13;
anticipate any significant change in the labor-intensive nature of the&#13;
production process," "there are few economies of scale in production&#13;
beyond an employment level of some 250"4' and&#13;

there is absolutely no scope for competing with low cost&#13;
imports on productivity....It is conspicuous that the&#13;
most capital intensive parts lof the industry -- things&#13;
like plastt7 tennis shoes -- were the very first part to&#13;
move out.&#13;
Increasingly, the emphasis has been on quality leather footwear, which,&#13;
however, has the least scope for mechanization and is labor-intensive&#13;
because (skilled) labor is needed to select carefully the pieces for&#13;
assembly. In the knitwear industry, more advanced techniques are also&#13;
being employed -- in fabric-making, with faster knitting machines; in&#13;
tights-making; and in the garment design and fabric-cutting processes.&#13;
On the other hand, this has not been true in the crucial stage of making&#13;
up the clothes (mainly sewing). Manufacturers have acknowledged that&#13;
comparative costs are such that...it is not possible for&#13;
the  UK  or  other  advanced  countries  to  compete&#13;
effectively in the supply of knitted goods, particularly&#13;
as they have no technological aqyantages over industries&#13;
in ldcs [developing countries] -&#13;
In both these industries, but especially in knitwear, the&#13;
effort to counteract the comparative advantage of developing countries&#13;
has also involved not so much a changing of factor intensities as a&#13;
changing of factor prices, that is, by trying to find and use low-cost&#13;
labor in the highly imperfect British labor market.  One technique has&#13;
been  to  employ  outworkers.    The  knitwear  industry,  especially  in&#13;
Leicester, has benefitted from access to disorganized Immigrant,&#13;
including family, labor.   In a similar way, Lancashire textiles and&#13;

Yorkshire woolens have recruited immigrant labor not only to hold down&#13;
the increases in real wages, but to counter the advantages that Far&#13;
Eastern producers have with respect to overhead, including more flexible&#13;
shift working.&#13;
To summarize, the possibility of reversing the comparative&#13;
disadvantage looks remote in three of the four industries and is&#13;
doubtful, though certainly not impossible, in the case of consumer&#13;
electronics.   In several instances, the industries have been pinning&#13;
their  hopes  on  automation.    However,  this  shows  not  only  dubious&#13;
business  sense,  but also  questionable  economic  theory.   The theory&#13;
indicates that developing countries may have a comparative advantage not&#13;
only  (and  not  necessarily)  in  labor-intensive  items,  but  also  in&#13;
"*mature" and "standardized" products -- like TVs, knives and forks and&#13;
non-leather shoes that use capital-intensive methods.   Automation may,&#13;
therefore, represent a cul-de-sac rather than an adjustment option.&#13;
&#13;

Chapter IV&#13;
ADJUSTMENT OPTIONS: THE DEGREES OF FREEDOM&#13;
Are there other options?  At the level of the firm, it is of&#13;
the greatest importance not only whether adjustment is to take place but&#13;
whether it is to be accomplished by means of growth and adaptation,&#13;
rather than by liquidation and the forced redeployment of labor and&#13;
physical assets.&#13;
The extent to which adjustment is "successful" -- that is,&#13;
smooth, relatively costless and not impeded by protectionist demands --&#13;
will depend in part on the options available and the availability (or&#13;
willingness)  of  firms  to  use  them.    The  options  can  be  broadly&#13;
categorized   into  two:       product   diversification  and  locational&#13;
diversification.&#13;
Product (or Horizontal) Diversification&#13;
Faced with the need to change their product mix, firms have&#13;
various possible strategies - diversification into other industries;&#13;
switching to "up market" items; or making "new" rather than established&#13;
products.&#13;
For firms in an industry facing limited growth prospects and&#13;
growing import competition across a broad range of products, an obvious&#13;
question is why not produce something else, or why not diversify into&#13;
other industries?   The chairman of Courtaulds,  the company with the&#13;
largest stake in both the knitting industry and in textiles more&#13;
generally, has noted, "it is reasonable to ask why we have persisted so&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
long in the textiles industry."L/ In fact, Courtaulds has carried out a&#13;
good  deal  of  successful  diversification.    In 1960,  its non-textile&#13;
activities  accounted  for less  than 20 percent of its  profits.   By&#13;
1979/80,  the  figure  had  expanded  to  40  percent,  although  these&#13;
activities accounted for less than a quarter of the group's sales and&#13;
capital employed.   These non-textile activities have included paints,&#13;
plastics, packaging, miscellaneous chemicals, engineering and, more&#13;
recently, medical equipment, frozen chickens and an eel farm.&#13;
Courtaulds illustrates both the possibilities and limitations&#13;
of diversification as a strategy. A large company (in fact, the world's&#13;
largest textile company) it has had the resources to acquire other firms&#13;
as growing concerns. It has also been able to diversify while remaining&#13;
within one broad industrial category:   chemicals.   In this way, it has&#13;
been able to adapt while at the same time maintaining faith with its&#13;
dictum that "businesses make money over the long term by concentrating&#13;
on what they are best at doing."'/ Finally, it has pursued a strategy&#13;
of seeking protection, acknowledging that it "has benefitted much&#13;
from...protection and it could not otherwise have developed the strength&#13;
it has."3/&#13;
Other cases of diversification have been less successful. With&#13;
the help of the government's National Enterprises Board, Tootal has&#13;
tried to diversify into paper-making, but its fine paper subsidiary,&#13;

Yates-Duxbury, recently went into liquidation, having suffered even more&#13;
from import competition than the textiles division had.&#13;
Successful "inter-industry" shifts have been more common with&#13;
firms in consumer electronics, since they have been an integral part of&#13;
the most rapidly expanding of all the industrial "families" --&#13;
electronics. Decca, for example, merged with Racal; that joint company&#13;
then dropped Decca's former interests in consumer goods and concentrated&#13;
instead on electronic capital goods, data communications and electronic&#13;
defense equipment. Philips, a European company with major interests in&#13;
Britain, is much more heavily enmeshed in consumer electronics, but is&#13;
trying  to  move  into  communications  and  capital  goods.    Rank  has&#13;
withdrawn from radio and TV manufacturing altogether to concentrate on&#13;
entertainment.   Even the most heavily committed of Britain's consumer&#13;
electronics companies, Thorn, has diversified into records, cinemas and&#13;
other entertainment through a merger with EMI and a half share of Thames&#13;
Television.  It has also been trying to build up a medical electronics&#13;
business.  Most of its profits have been coming from TV rentals rather&#13;
than from manufacturers.&#13;
Generalizing,  it  is  clear  that  diversification  into  new&#13;
industries is possible but not always successful and that usually&#13;
companies will seek activities which are related.  Firms may be better&#13;
equipped to diversify horizontally if they are large and if they have&#13;
access either to a "core" industrial technology or to a marketing system&#13;
which  they  can  develop.    It  has  been  easier  for  chemicals  and&#13;
electronics firms to identify horizontal alternatives than for those&#13;
companies making only garments, table cutlery or footwear.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
For the latter, specialization within the industry -- in "up-&#13;
market" products -- may be more feasible. In the footwear industry, for&#13;
example, a recognized objective of the industry as a whole is that there&#13;
should be "a marked movement towards upgrading.''L/  Several firms have&#13;
consciously opted for an "up-market" strategy with the objective of&#13;
selling higher-priced leather shoes, while running down and eventually&#13;
abandoning their low-priced footwear output:&#13;
There has been a steady move upwards in quality as it was&#13;
found that those group companies operating in the higher&#13;
quality footwear market were ppving to be not quite so&#13;
vulnerable to low-cost imports -&#13;
In practice, this textbook solution is fraught with problems.&#13;
First, the belief that British manufacturers can move en masse to the&#13;
better quality end of the domestic market is a fallacy. A condition for&#13;
survival of the few may be bankruptcy of the many.  The many, however,&#13;
may use their weight in the industry associations to press for more&#13;
protection, as they already have.   Exporting could provide an escape&#13;
valve, but this merely elevates the fallacy to a higher level -- all&#13;
industrial countries could do the same. Second, to the extent that the&#13;
move "up-market" depends on a relatively high income elasticity of&#13;
demand for these products, it also depends on a continued rise in&#13;
income.    In  times  of  recession,  "up-market"  firms  may  be  very&#13;
vulnerable. In 1981, for example, the demand for footwear was shifting&#13;
to  lower  priced,  lower  quality  shoes,  the  reverse  of  previous&#13;

trends.-L   Clarks,  a leading firm,  reported that the recession was&#13;
forcing parents to switch from leather to less expensive canvas shoes&#13;
for their children and said:&#13;
...the company cannot compete in the children's canvas&#13;
shoes market on an equal basis with imports because they&#13;
have to make them on existing high quality lasts which&#13;
forces up the pricel2/&#13;
Third, there is evidence that developing countries as well as the&#13;
Southern European ones are advancing in terms of quality. Brazil is now&#13;
seen as a major threat, precisely because it has developed a capability&#13;
to make footwear as sophisticated as any in the world.&#13;
Finally, a particular problem with footwear is the prevalence&#13;
of small, one plant firms with limited managerial and financial&#13;
resources. The companies producing high quality leather goods need more&#13;
working  capital  to  stock  (more  valuable)  products  and  leather.&#13;
Evidently, many companies have found these problems to be extremely&#13;
difficult:&#13;
...clearly, the balance sheet ratios demonstrate that, on&#13;
average, all leather made-to-order shoe companies have&#13;
the weakest financial structure.   Their bank borrowings&#13;
and trade creditors are the 3 ghest, resulting in their&#13;
very poor liquidity position._&#13;
In an industry with many small and vulnerable firms, there is a&#13;
familiar  dilemma:    exposed  to  competition, many companies will die&#13;

adjust.&#13;
In the other industries studied, there has also been a general&#13;
commitment   to  "up-market"   diversification,   for   example,   toward&#13;
silverplate cutlery and quality knitwear:&#13;
The inability of the [knitwear] industry to compete with&#13;
low cost producers in sectors of the market where demand&#13;
is   highly   price   sensitive  must   be  more   widely&#13;
recognised.   A greater proportion of the industry 17eeds&#13;
to concentrate on the less price sensitive sectors &#13;
Yet  they face the same dilemmas:   a reluctance  to cede the "mass"&#13;
market; competition from developing countries in some quality products&#13;
(e.g., "Shetland" wool jerseys from Mauritius); and the "squeeze" the&#13;
recession has created on the luxury goods market.&#13;
Another way forward can be product innovation. "New" products&#13;
have been a central preoccupation in consumer electronics, whose history&#13;
is actually one of new product development -- from radios to monochrome&#13;
TVs, from monochrome TVs to color TVs, and now to video.&#13;
The key argument is whether protection of existing products is&#13;
necessary --  or  inimical --  to the development  of new ones.   The&#13;
industry has argued a need to preserve the existing nucleus of labor&#13;
skills and plant infrastructure out of which new products can grow&#13;
organically":&#13;

.any production depends on the continued existence in&#13;
the short and medium term of the plants and experti E7&#13;
which are currently vulnerable to overseas competition_&#13;
The few remaining audio producers believe that the British industry&#13;
"over adjusted" by moving out of radios almost entirely, thereby passing&#13;
up opportunities for many new products:&#13;
... the UK is facing difficulties in the consumer goods&#13;
area by our inability to produce, competitively, clock&#13;
radios and other ra do combination products after losing&#13;
our radio industry &#13;
The head of Philips has claimed that, despite evidence of falling&#13;
demand, television is not yet a "mature" product:&#13;
I really believe that the market for television sets is&#13;
in its infancy...there is a widely shared belief that the&#13;
next few years will see an explosion of demand for new&#13;
types of entertainment and information systems which will&#13;
create  a  huge  new  market  for  more  sophisticated&#13;
televi ton sets and for video equipment to be attached to&#13;
them &#13;
The other element in the argument is that major new product&#13;
development requires companies that are able to generate sufficient&#13;
profits on existing products to finance the R&amp;D and to underwrite future&#13;
investment plans.   Imports cause, it is argued, a reduction in factory&#13;
loading, which reduces the profits per unit on color TVs, the main&#13;
source of resources for reinvestment in R&amp;D for new products.&#13;

It is by no means certain that these arguments are correct.&#13;
Despite protection for color TVs and, to a lesser extent, other items,&#13;
there are only a few signs that British-based manufacturers are&#13;
launching a new generation of products.  Nor is it clear that the main&#13;
opportunities will lie in manufacturing as opposed to the related&#13;
services; that new products should be developed rather than produced&#13;
under license; that manufacture should be linked to existing production&#13;
facilities; or even that radio and TV manufacturers are the companies&#13;
best placed to exploit the new opportunities.&#13;
Locational (or Vertical) Specialization&#13;
Another approach to adjustment is for firms to abandon those&#13;
stages  of  production  in  which  they  have  lost  any  competitive&#13;
advantage.   A response of this kind may be attractive when there is a&#13;
product mix which does not lend itself to horizontal diversification:&#13;
for example, homogeneous products not subject to differentiation or&#13;
product innovation.&#13;
One classic technique widely employed in textiles and in&#13;
consumer electronics in the EC and the United States has been offshore&#13;
processing (OP).  Textiles, including knitting, firms could ensure that&#13;
British fabrics are incorporated in any imports of clothing by&#13;
contracting out (or relocating) the labor-intensive sewing operations to&#13;
low-wage developing countries, perhaps using pre-set designs and with&#13;
the fabrics already cut.  The garment is then re-imported for finishing&#13;
and packaging.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
British firms have been slow to see the possibilities and have&#13;
never sought the kind of tax inducements offered in West Germany, the&#13;
United States and Holland. At present they are opposed to any extension&#13;
of OP. For example,&#13;
...an escalation of the technique known as OP [is] seen&#13;
by the Knitting Industries Federation as a further major&#13;
thorn in our side, [and] will reduce the Industry's&#13;
competitive ability at home and in other Community&#13;
markets.   The UK is not well placed geographically to&#13;
take advantage of a technique which is J3 any event&#13;
tantamount to exporting UK capital and jobs-'&#13;
The reason for this conservatism is that the big British&#13;
textile companies had already committed themselves heavily to a policy&#13;
the opposite of vertical specialization -- to vertical integration, or&#13;
from fibers to garments -- within Britain itself. Further, the British&#13;
government has backed the restructuring of the textile industry&#13;
undertaken by the fiber companies and has helped develop the concept of&#13;
an integrated textiles "pipeline," with protection accorded the most&#13;
vulnerable parts.&#13;
While some "offshore processing" of British components has&#13;
taken place in consumer electronics, the most striking feature there has&#13;
been a different phenomenon:  finishing touch assembly.  Japanese firms&#13;
and the Taiwanese company, Tatung, have invested in assembly operations&#13;
in the United Kingdom.  They have, however, been accused by critics of&#13;
using  their  plants  to  assemble  kits  of TV  parts.    (In fact,  the&#13;
1/   Knitting Industries Federation,  "Evidence to the House of Lords&#13;
Select Committee on the European Communities," Parliament, Select&#13;
Committee on European Communities, 16th report, Session 1978/79,&#13;
London, 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
accusations do not seem too well-founded, since most of the plants have&#13;
been using substantial amounts of local components.)&#13;
A similar concept is involved in the practice widely employed&#13;
in the cutlery industry of importing "blanks" and then carrying out the&#13;
final stage of manufacture -- silverplating and other finishing work --&#13;
in Britain.   Other firms in the chain whose position has thereby been&#13;
weakened have strongly resisted this approach, as has been true with&#13;
other forms of vertical specialization.&#13;
Vertical specialization can be taken one step further by&#13;
eliminating  the  British  manufacturing  component  entirely  through&#13;
manufacturer  importing.   Manufacturer  importing  arises  in different&#13;
ways: some English manufacturers buy abroad on an "arms length" basis;&#13;
some invest in exporting plants in developing countries; and some&#13;
subcontract  some  operations  or  license  their  brand  to  overseas&#13;
suppliers.&#13;
In  two  of  the  four  industries,   cutlery  and  consumer&#13;
electronics,  importing has become  a major  source  of profit  and an&#13;
important technique for adjustment out of unprofitable activities. Many&#13;
cutlery manufacturers have been importing a portion of their sales.&#13;
They have processed some goods in Britain (in the form of silverplating)&#13;
or have simply repackaged them; sometimes the products have not even&#13;
been unwrapped. Importing manufacturers, of whom Viners is the biggest,&#13;
argue   that   their   practice   is  good   business   sense,   that  an&#13;
industrialist's first objective is survival:&#13;
...there is no way that we can beat the Far Eastern&#13;
countries at their own game, but what we can do is to use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
their cheaper products to open up a wider sec t,r of the&#13;
market and to generate profits for investment_&#13;
There  has  been  a  snag  in  this  strategy.    Manufacturer&#13;
importing, as with other forms of specialized importing, is itself under&#13;
competitive pressure. Mail-order companies and supermarkets can cut out&#13;
the importers' margin. South Korean exporters in particular have learnt&#13;
how to bypass the manufacturer-importers and to sell directly to the&#13;
retail outlet. In fact, since the mid-1960s, the share of manufacturers&#13;
in the importing business has slumped from 80 percent to 25 percent.&#13;
Viners' financial problems have been in part the result of this trend.&#13;
A further consequence of manufacturer importing has been&#13;
serious conflict between the two rival manufacturers' federations, one&#13;
favoring prompt and tight protection, the other a looser set of VERs to&#13;
harmonize with its importing facilities. The leader of the former noted&#13;
that:&#13;
...[the  relevant  Minister]  made  it  clear  that  the&#13;
industry had to decide whether it wanted to be an&#13;
importer or manufacturer. I replied that the activities&#13;
of a few should not be seen to be ty  cal of an industry&#13;
which, generally, deplored importing -&#13;
Manufacturer importing is much further advanced in consumer&#13;
electronics, where it has been taking place under what is known as OEM&#13;
(Original  Equipment  Manufacturer)  contracts.    The  appeal  of  OEM&#13;
contracting is obvious: to exporters, it offers market access (although&#13;
some Japanese companies like Sony have opposed it, preferring to build&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

up their own brand names); to importing manufacturers, it offers the&#13;
opportunity to profit from Imports while concentrating their own&#13;
efforts.&#13;
OEM imports have been accounting for a substantial share of the&#13;
current imports of "new" products such as video-recorders. Thorn, among&#13;
other manufacturing companies, has been importing video-recorders from&#13;
Japan and selling them through its video rental network. OEMs have also&#13;
been important with other "mature" products, such as radios and&#13;
combinations, in which developing country exporters have predominated.&#13;
It should be added that manufacturer importing has also served&#13;
as a major device for facilitating adjustment to import competition in&#13;
other sectors where the import penetration by developing countries, has,&#13;
however, been relatively uncontroversial: toys, sporting goods, leather&#13;
goods such as saddlery, and rubber shoes.  It has generally been less&#13;
prevalent in clothing and footwear because of the dominance of retailers&#13;
as importers.  Nevertheless, manufacturer importing is recognized as a&#13;
irowing trend:&#13;
Britain's major textile companies pin their hope for&#13;
survival on overseas production and direct importing&#13;
using 1yheir already well established British trade&#13;
marks -&#13;
They recognize, to quote John Shelton of Coats Paton, that "in this&#13;
country we let importing get-into the wrong hands."2/&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Overall, manufacturer importing could be seen as part of a more&#13;
general tendency for manufacturers affected by import competition to&#13;
move from the production of trade goods to non-traded services. Here,&#13;
distribution  represents  the  most  obvious  point  of  entry  for  a&#13;
specialized firm.  In consumer electronics, the British retail, rental&#13;
and sales operations of Thorn-EMI have provided the company with&#13;
substantially  more  profits  than  manufacturing.    In  footwear  and&#13;
knitwear, the leading companies -- Clarks and Jaeger (of Coats Paton) --&#13;
have had their own retail outlets become independent and growing sources&#13;
of profits.   Research has shown that,  in recent years  in general,&#13;
distribution has been significantly more profitable in the United&#13;
Kingdom than manufacturing has 1/&#13;
That individual companies should wish to diversify in this way&#13;
can be regarded as a form of market adjustment.  However, in terms of&#13;
the economy as a whole, it is perhaps a symptom of a deeper structural&#13;
maladjustment in which internationally traded activities have generally&#13;
been uncompetitive because the effective rate of exchange has, over a&#13;
period of years, not been favorable to them.&#13;
A final option is foreign investment, which can be seen in part&#13;
as an extension of the mechanism already described -- vertical&#13;
specialization    (through    offshore   processing)    and   horizontal&#13;
specialization (developing new products on a multinational basis).  On&#13;
the other hand, foreign investment can have quite different features --&#13;

Industrial Sectors," Bank of England Discussion Paper No. 15,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
it can involve building up an international business in an industry&#13;
which is contracting in Britain or simply the acquisition of a&#13;
miscellany of financial assets overseas.&#13;
As can be seen from Table 3, there has been a general tendency&#13;
for capital in low technology industries to migrate overseas and for&#13;
these industries to attract relatively less foreign capital to the&#13;
United Kingdom than other industries. International capital flows have,&#13;
therefore, reinforced comparative advantages.&#13;
Foreign investment has become the main line of retreat for the&#13;
major textile companies to the extent that in 1981 it accounted for a&#13;
majority of the overseas earnings of several. Furthest along this road&#13;
has been Coats Paton, with 75 percent of its sales overseas. Most sales&#13;
have been by overseas subsidiaries, and almost all the new investment&#13;
has been overseas.   Courtaulds has been moving in the same direction,&#13;
with 30 percent of its sales coming from overseas subsidiaries, which&#13;
accounted for almost 50 percent of its profits in 1980.   Its current&#13;
managing director argues,&#13;
...on the whole the UK is not a good base from which to&#13;
manufacture and compete  internationally.   There is no&#13;
barrief, in my' mind [as] to where we manufacture our&#13;
goods -&#13;
Even spokesmen for the textile industry as a whole have argued that&#13;
...textile companies should consider going overseas to&#13;
less  developed  countries and  setting  up plan Y/ where&#13;
there may be a considerable commercial advantage.-.&#13;

Of the smaller knitwear companies,&#13;
...it is being confidently predicted in many quarters&#13;
that more and more UK knitted garments manuf cturers will&#13;
seek their future fortunes on foreign Soil1I&#13;
At the same time, however, there is plenty of evidence of&#13;
pitfalls.    Foreign  investment  is  risky  and  difficult  to  control,&#13;
especially  for  small companies.   The only  cutlery  company  to  have&#13;
ventured overseas on a significant scale -- Viners -- has found, as have&#13;
other smallish companies, that problems of managerial control are&#13;
severe.    Its  overseas  French  subsidiary    proved  unprofitable  and&#13;
required constant attention.&#13;
What has been surprising is the disinclination of most British&#13;
consumer electronics companies to follow this route. It is an industry&#13;
which, more generally, has a strongly international character.  There&#13;
are  exceptions,  though.   BSR, one  of the  largest companies and  a&#13;
producer of record changers, has, from 1980 to 1982, changed from being&#13;
a British-based company employing 18,000 workers in England to an&#13;
international electronics company heavily involved in the Far East, with&#13;
5,000 workers there and only 8,000 left in Britain 2/&#13;

Chapter V&#13;
SEEKING PROTECTION: THE LOBBIES&#13;
In general, it can be said that the more adjustment options&#13;
there are, and the more success companies have in availing themselves of&#13;
the options, the less they will seek protection. It has been seen that&#13;
the consumer electronics industry has had possibilities for diversifica-&#13;
tion into related fields and new product development and for interna-&#13;
tional specialization within large companies. Company brand names have&#13;
also been strong. It therefore has had considerable freedom to maneuver&#13;
and has not had to open the many small firms that have populated the&#13;
traditional craft industries such as footwear and cutlery.&#13;
In practice, however, life has not been so simple. The large&#13;
British consumer electronics and the integrated textile companies, even&#13;
while exploring the full range of adjustment options, nonetheless have&#13;
remained strongly protectionist when it permitted the extraction of&#13;
profits from relatively declining activities for use elsewhere. On the&#13;
other hand, some firms within even the most unpromising industries have&#13;
found a market niche secure from international competition, thus&#13;
weakening their drive for protection.   The balance of these different&#13;
interests and of other interested parties, notably the workforce, will&#13;
determine the direction and effectiveness of lobbying.&#13;
Protectionist Behavior: The Explanations&#13;
Explanations of why some British industry lobbies have been&#13;
relatively more successful in obtaining protection are not easy to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
find. The final determination of trade policy takes place at the EC --&#13;
not the national -- level.   Further, in England, the decision-making&#13;
process is shrouded in an official secrecy that is often ludicrous. As&#13;
one of the main consumer electronics unions has noted, "the union has&#13;
been active  in the corridors  of power.   Often these meetings were&#13;
confidential, private, even secret.''/&#13;
Broadly, pro-protectionist behavior can be analyzed using one&#13;
of two alternative "models," or ways of characterizing society.   The&#13;
first can be described as "pluralist":   it looks at the ways in which&#13;
democratic politics reflects different interests through the voting and&#13;
legislative  processes.   The other,  described  here as  "corporatist,"&#13;
concentrates on the ways in which significant economic interests are&#13;
assimilated into the decision-making of the state.   In the first, the&#13;
emphasis lies on the political importance of different industries --&#13;
their size and geographical concentration -- and on their motivation to&#13;
pursue the issue politically. In the second, the emphasis lies more on&#13;
the effectiveness with which the various elements in the industry --&#13;
workers, manufacturers, producers, distributors and large and small&#13;
companies -- can be brought together into an effective "national"&#13;
grouping which can penetrate, and be accepted by, government. No doubt&#13;
there are elements of both, although it seems that the second has been&#13;
more important.&#13;

circular, London, November 1977.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
The Pluralist Explanation&#13;
At first sight, the "pluralist" explanation seems to fit&#13;
best.   The large and regionally concentrated knitting industry, which&#13;
has over 100,000 workers located mainly in a few East Midlands towns and&#13;
over 700,000 in the wider family of textiles, has achieved its&#13;
protectionist lobbying objectives for the most part.  The tiny cutlery&#13;
industry -- down to 4,000 workers in table cutlery from 25,000 at the&#13;
end  of  the  war  --  has  been  largely  ineffectual,   despite  its&#13;
concentration in Sheffield. Footwear and consumer electronics have been&#13;
roughly intermediate in standing, and this has been reflected in the&#13;
degree of protection achieved.&#13;
At the same time, there is much that is not explained by this&#13;
theory.  There is no evidence that the trade policy pertaining to these&#13;
industries has had any impact on electoral politics.   There has been&#13;
every reason to doubt, until the current recession, that a fear of&#13;
redundancy was a potent force.   In 1980, the footwear industry noted,&#13;
"studies have shown shortages of labour, particularly of skilled&#13;
machinists,  in  most  parts  of  the  industry.    Problems  have  been&#13;
especially acute in Northamptonshire."Y/ In knitwear, too, until very&#13;
recently there have been difficulties of recruitment, and much labor (in&#13;
Leicester, for example) has been drawn from Indian and East African&#13;
immigrants.   The cutlery industry has also encountered shortages of&#13;
certain types of labor, as well as a large turnover and an inability to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
recruit  younger  workers.   Tracer  studies  conducted by the Overseas&#13;
Development Institute in 1978 indicated that, at a time when demands for&#13;
import controls for footwear and cutlery were strong, displaced workers&#13;
in general were finding new jobs very quickly.&#13;
The Corporatist Explanation&#13;
The real influence of the knitting industry has lain mainly in&#13;
its being part of a wider and extremely powerful textiles lobby.   At&#13;
first  sight,   the  main  manufacturers'   association,   the  Knitting&#13;
Industries Federation (KIF), is an awkward bedfellow for other textiles&#13;
interests.   Alone among the many textile associations (including the&#13;
Scottish Knitwear Council), it has stood aloof from the umbrella group,&#13;
the British Textiles Confederation.   It has stressed its own identity&#13;
and regional roots.   In practice, however, the differences were never&#13;
pushed to divisive lengths.   On such a potentially difficult issue as&#13;
the Tokyo Round tariff cuts, where the EC obtained tariff cuts for&#13;
knitwear and woolens in the United States in return for very small&#13;
reductions in the tariff on manmade fibers, the KIF went along with the&#13;
negative opinion of the industry, as enunciated by the fiber companies.&#13;
The process of reaching consensus within the textiles "family"&#13;
has been facilitated by the existence of informal contacts through&#13;
committees like the "Derby Group," which has been meeting regularly to&#13;
ensure that any disagreements are not aired in public or in front of&#13;
officials and ministers. What has made cooperation easier has been the&#13;
expansion of the manmade fiber companies, especially Courtaulds, into&#13;
knitting as well as into Lancashire textiles. The fiber companies have&#13;
been as conscious as the clothing and knitwear companies themselves of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
competition from imports of "low-cost" clothing that incorporate manmade&#13;
fibers (usually Japanese). They have been a major unifying force in the&#13;
lobby for protection of "downstream" products. There has been a similar&#13;
collaboration at the EC level, where the knitters' federation (MAIEUROP)&#13;
has acted as a link between the textile manufacturers (COMITEXTIL) and&#13;
the garment makers (AEIH) associations.&#13;
The trade unions have done their bit, too.  The main industry&#13;
union is the National Union of Hosiery and Knitwear (NUHKW), with about&#13;
two-thirds  of  the  workforce.    It  has  a  strong  sense  of  industry&#13;
identity, since it embraces all the different craft skills within the&#13;
industry  and  does  compete  outside  it  for members.   The weight of&#13;
tradition has also been heavy (going back over 200 years)..!&#13;
Unlike many British unions, the NUHKW has been largely non-&#13;
political and has not been at all militant industrially. If there has&#13;
been a guiding ideology, it has been patriotism rather than socialism.&#13;
Some of the NUHKW's ethos was captured during a recent, anti-import&#13;
demonstration (to the tune of "Jesus Loves Little Children"):&#13;
We don't need no foreign imports&#13;
Unemployment makes us poor.&#13;
We've got workers by the score&#13;
Please don't shut our factory doors&#13;
Freeze the imports; that's the tonic&#13;
our firms need&#13;
British is Best:  British is Best.2-&#13;

The union has collaborated actively with employers on trade&#13;
matters.  In 1981, it worked with the KIF (and the dyers' employers) in&#13;
a tripartite campaign under the banner, "The British Knitting Industry&#13;
-- To Live or Let Die."   It organized, with the KIF, a "Buy British"&#13;
demonstration in Leicester (which was addressed by a Conservative&#13;
M.P.).  The manufacturers have, in turn, supported union demands for a&#13;
"social clause" in trade agreements, ostensibly designed to secure the&#13;
rights of trade unions in textile-exporting countries.   The union has&#13;
also helped to mobilize the resources of the wider union movement behind&#13;
the industry and has worked with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and&#13;
with European unions to organize a campaign of token textile strikes&#13;
across Europe to demand tougher trade restrictions (the last was on&#13;
December 2, 1980).&#13;
Another crucial, if surprising, ally has been the largest&#13;
retailer, M &amp; S (Marks and Spencer).   M &amp; S accounts for about 15&#13;
percent of all British clothing sales, with much higher shares in the&#13;
hosiery and knitwear market.   M &amp; S prides itself on retailing almost&#13;
exclusively British goods.&#13;
No doubt commercial ad well as patriotic reasoning originally&#13;
inspired this policy. In the late 1970s, it led to M &amp; S being undercut&#13;
by chain  stores  and mail-order  companies which were importing  from&#13;
developing countries.  Given its policy to refrain from importing, the&#13;
company was led to a position very close to that of the manufacturers,&#13;
and it has publicly endorsed demands for stricter import controls.  Not&#13;
only is M &amp; S highly prestigious in its own right, but its association&#13;
with  the  producers  has  considerably  weakened Ithe  argument  other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
retailers have put forward that protection is "bad for the consumer" or&#13;
merely a "sectional interest."&#13;
This powerful coalition of manufacturers, unions and retailers,&#13;
united in what has been presented as a common "patriotic" cause, must&#13;
have been extremely intimidating to most ministers and officials.&#13;
A similar coalition to protect TV producers has emerged in the&#13;
consumer electronics industry, though from much less solidly rooted --&#13;
and certainly more cosmopolitan -  constituents.   The manufacturers'&#13;
interests are represented by BREMA (the British Radio and Electrical&#13;
Manufacturers  Association),   which  incorporates  not  only  British&#13;
companies, but also foreign transnationals -- led by Philips -- and the&#13;
main Japanese firms which produce in the United Kingdom. They seem an&#13;
improbable lobby,  but there are several major strengths.   The main&#13;
members can be easily assembled around one table to make decisions.&#13;
There is little parochial or regional jealousy.  Lobbying costs are a&#13;
negligible concern.   These groups can attract and afford to pay top&#13;
names:  in 1980, BREMA's president was Lord Thorneycroft, who was also&#13;
the chairman of the Conservative Party. Thorn-EMI, the biggest British&#13;
consumer electronics manufacturer, and Philips, the two companies which&#13;
effectively dominate BREMA, have developed a strong common interest in&#13;
protecting British large-screen TV production and some other items.&#13;
It might seem odd that Philips, in particular, should have been&#13;
a strident defender of British Import controls, given that it is a&#13;
multinational company with many importing interestF (components; small&#13;
screen TVs; and car radios from Philips, Singapore, in competition with&#13;
Britain's  last  remaining  producer).       The  company  *has,  however,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
sufficiently strong involvement in British production of tubes and TVs&#13;
and in product development that it has campaigned forcefully:&#13;
I believe intervention is absolutely necessary...I make&#13;
the case to the Administration that they got us ir4o this&#13;
bloody mess; they should try to get us out of it -'&#13;
Even odder are the Japanese TV companies.  However, they have&#13;
had to prove themselves as "good British citizens," and, perhaps more to&#13;
the point, they now have an interest in preventing other Japanese&#13;
companies (like Sharp) or the South Koreans from exporting direct to the&#13;
United Kingdom (and the EC).&#13;
Another potential source of dissension -- the retailers -- has&#13;
been largely neutralized by the heavy involvement of manufacturers in&#13;
distribution,  particularly in "rental sales."   The manufacturers have&#13;
also received a good deal of help from the unions, especially the&#13;
electricians' union (EEPTU).  Its relations with BREMA have been good:&#13;
the relevant national officer, Roy Sanderson, has traveled abroad with&#13;
the association and has sat in on VER negotiations regularly.   The&#13;
union, in turn, has accepted the legitimacy of some manufacturers'&#13;
importing and the need for substantial reductions in employment as a&#13;
result  of  automation  and  rationalization.    There  has  been  little&#13;
industrial conflict. Further, a history of conflict with the Communists&#13;
in the union has led its current leadership to be forcefully "moderate,"&#13;
and it has eschewed anti-business campaigns. It has been a useful ally&#13;
for BREMA, especially in mobilizing Labor ministers and M.P.s.&#13;

The footwear industry lobby has been led by the main&#13;
manufacturers'   association,   the   British   Footwear   Manufacturers&#13;
Association (BFMA), and another cooperative industry union, the National&#13;
Union of Footwear, Leather and Allied Trades (NUFLAT).  This lobby has&#13;
been trying, with growing success, to emulate the more successful&#13;
textiles lobby, but it too has had some weaknesses. One has been a lack&#13;
of backing from the producers of the major "upstream" products, for&#13;
example, the fiber companies, although the tanners have started to work&#13;
more closely on lobbying with the  footwear companies.   Second,  the&#13;
manufacturers (and unions) have been split, with a separate association&#13;
and union representing the 10 percent or so of t4e workforce in the&#13;
Rosserdale area of Northeast Lancashire, and, more divisively, by the&#13;
Rubber and Plastics Footwear Group, which represents companies such as&#13;
Dunlop that have become predominantly importers of items such as&#13;
plimsols (a type of shoe).   (Ironically, it was these companies which&#13;
had first beat a protectionist path to the government's door in the&#13;
1960s.  Having been turned away, they largely abandoned production for&#13;
importing under British brand names.)&#13;
Finally, the dominant force in the industry has not been a&#13;
manufacturer --  almost  all companies,  bar a handful,  are one-plant&#13;
enterprises -   but a big  distributor,  the British Shoe Corporation&#13;
(BSC), which has had 20 percent of the retail mariet.   BSC, unlike&#13;
M &amp; S, the corresponding clothing distributor, has had no compunction&#13;
about buying from the cheapest source and is a major importer.  Still,&#13;
the  producers  have been successful  in enlisting support  for import&#13;
controls  from  the Independent Footwear, Retailers Association  (whose&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
1,000 members have  feared,  above all,  competition from BSC).   With&#13;
government help, they have skillfully maneuvered the "multiple" stores,&#13;
including BSC, into a "Buy British" policy which has effectively&#13;
neutralized their previous opposition to import controls.&#13;
The cutlery industry, by contrast with these, has provided an&#13;
object  lesson in how not to lobby for protection.   Ironically,  the&#13;
compact, geographically concentrated nature of this tiny industry has&#13;
contributed not to unity, but to division, which has been expressed&#13;
openly and often highly vituperatively.   There are four manufacturers'&#13;
associations:    the  Cutlery  and  Silverware  Association  (CSA);  the&#13;
Federation of Cutlery Manufacturers (FBCM); the Sheffield Spoon and Fork&#13;
Blank Makers Association; the Manufacturing Silversmiths Association.&#13;
The two most important have been the CSA and the FBCM.&#13;
The  core  of  their  disagreement  has  been  manufacturer-&#13;
importing. The FBCM was formed solely to combat imports and excludes&#13;
from membership any firm with substantial importing interests (over 20&#13;
percent of turnover). The CSA, which has been dominated by Viners, has&#13;
been more equivocal about its objectives, but, as its president has&#13;
explained:&#13;
I  contend  there  is  nothing  wrong  with  a  cutlery&#13;
manufacturer, finding his market eroded by imports,&#13;
attempting to preserve his market share by coyeting&#13;
directly against the importers who have eroded it._&#13;
The unions have been little better organized.   Although only&#13;
about half of the workforce of 4,000 has been unionized, three unions&#13;

- 50 -       I&#13;
have been involved. One, the National Union of Goldsmiths, Silversmiths&#13;
and Allied Trades (NUGSAT), is a highly specialized, small craft union&#13;
based in Sheffield; the others are the country's biggest general&#13;
unions:   the Transport and General Workers (T&amp;GWU) and the General and&#13;
Municipal Workers (GMWU).  These unions have lobbied for the industry,&#13;
but on occasion their efforts have been compromised by conflicts with&#13;
the companies over wages.&#13;
For an industry so tiny and divided, it is surprising that so&#13;
much vigorous lobbying has been carried out.  In large part the reason&#13;
has been the unifying efforts of the Sheffield City Council and the&#13;
city's M.P.s.  Even at this late stage, with the industry virtually at&#13;
death's door, the FBCM is trying to form a coalition of manufacturers&#13;
from  some  other  small  and  vulnerable  industries:    the  hollow-ware&#13;
industry, represented by the silverware section of the British Jewellers&#13;
Association; the silverware and leather goods sections of the British&#13;
Giftware Federation;  and the Brush Makers Association.   As the FBCM&#13;
noted,&#13;
...many  industries  are  facing  reduction;  in  future&#13;
potential  and  perhaps  extinction as the flood of Far&#13;
Eastern  imports  accelerates.   A bond  between various&#13;
trade bodies...can only be good for all the industries&#13;
concerned f/&#13;
The Politics of Decision-Making&#13;
It is one thing to have a united industry lobby. It is another&#13;
to get decision-makers to act, and British ministers and officials have&#13;

been constrained in what they can do: externally by the limitations the&#13;
EC has imposed on national trade policy and by the potential threat of&#13;
retaliatory action, and internally by the need to balance the different&#13;
constituents of the "national interest."   Two key influences on the&#13;
government's behavior have been, first, the balance of these internal&#13;
and external pressures as expressed through the governmental machinery,&#13;
and, second, ideology.&#13;
Trade policy decisions are the immediate responsibility of the&#13;
Department of Trade.  It is to take into account foreign reactions (as&#13;
determined by its own export promotion and GATT divisions and by the&#13;
Foreign  Office)  and  domestic  pressure  (represented  mainly  by  the&#13;
Department of Industry and employment-sensitive departments such as&#13;
those representing the regions, as well as by the Department of&#13;
Employment).  It is possible that a more detached view of the national&#13;
economic interest -- represented by the Treasury -- would be given equal&#13;
weight, but this is unlikely unless subsidies (rather than quotas) are&#13;
Involved. The crux of the matter has been well-summarized by BREMA:&#13;
The Department of Industry provides invaluable help,&#13;
being fully conscious of the needs of manufacturers. The&#13;
Department of Trade, on the other hand, is inclined to&#13;
find itself in a dichotomy because of its need, on one&#13;
hand, to promote exports and two way trade and, on the&#13;
other,   t   protect  home  industry  against  excessive&#13;
imports.-&#13;
The influence of ideology is of several kinds.  The traditional&#13;
belief in "free trade" is still to be found in parts of the Department&#13;
of Trade and has been well-represented by recent prime ministers --&#13;
1/   Op. cit., BREMA, p. 173.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Heath, Wilson, Callaghan and Thatcher.  All of them appear to have had&#13;
free trade instincts (the first two built their ministerial reputations&#13;
on trade liberalization programs at the Board of Trade, while the last&#13;
has identified strongly with free market ideas of all kinds).  At the&#13;
same time, there has been another belief -- perhaps more deeply held at&#13;
the official level -- which is mercantilist in origin.   It has been&#13;
summed up in the phrase, "Great Britain Ltd." and expresses the&#13;
"corporatist" idea that the state, businessmen and unions should be as&#13;
one, working through trade policy for a common national (producerst)&#13;
interest.&#13;
In  Britain,  as  in  some  other  European  countries,  this&#13;
"'corporatism" has had an institutional expression -- the network of&#13;
bipartisan sector working parties (SWPs) set up under the National&#13;
Economic Development Council. Although the SWPs were to have been more&#13;
influential under Labour than under the Conservatives, they have&#13;
continued to produce their reports, which have recommended the need for&#13;
government action against Imports of shoes, textiles and consumer&#13;
electronics, among other things.  Further, the developing tradition of&#13;
liaison between officials, manufacturers and unions has continued to&#13;
ensure that an influential "industryl view" will be fed into the&#13;
Departments of Industry and TrAde.&#13;
One side of this "corporatist" approach to trade policy has&#13;
been a belief in the need for a "tough" trade policy in defense of&#13;
"national"  trading interests, especially when foreign competition has&#13;
been  defined  as  "unfair."    One  industry  spokesman  acknowledged&#13;
disarmingly, "the term 'unfair competition' has been used and misused so&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
often that it hardly has any meaning left" (however, he subsequently&#13;
noted "twenty six unfair advantages that Korea has over its European&#13;
counterparts") 1/                                      i&#13;
The significance of these "fairness" arguments, which have been&#13;
widely used and accepted, is that they have removed from producers the&#13;
stigma of seeking favors.   Instead, by having as their starting point&#13;
conventional assumptions about the "rules of the game" in International&#13;
trade negotiations, they have demanded that trade decision-makers act as&#13;
defenders of "the national interest." In this way, competing claims on&#13;
the "national interest" -- of exporters or of those concerned with anti-&#13;
inflation policy -- can be bypassed.&#13;
There are several good examples of this "corporatist" approach&#13;
to trade policy decision-making among the four indust.ry studies. Within&#13;
its SWP, the consumer electronics industry developed a clearly defined&#13;
strategy for the future of the industry.   In effect, a bargain was&#13;
struck.   The industry -- and Thorn and Philips in particular -- would&#13;
invest heavily in the automation of TV assembly and in new products.&#13;
The unions would not obstruct the changes.  The government would shore&#13;
up the home market from Far nastern competition, at least for several&#13;
years.   This it did through unilateral quotas leading to "voluntary"&#13;
industry-to-industry agreements.   There is no evidence that the main&#13;
elements of this mutual understanding lost their force with the change&#13;
in government.&#13;
1/   Op. cit., "First Survival; Then Growth."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
In textiles, the "corporatist" process of decisionr-making arose&#13;
in the early 1960s, when the MacMillan government introduced limited&#13;
trade protection and an adjustment assistance program for the Lancashire&#13;
cotton industry. Subsequently, Courtaulds acquired a substantial share&#13;
of the industry, which it intended to integrate vertically with its&#13;
fiber operations.   Through a "mass market" strategy, it would achieve&#13;
economies of scale from the bulk production of fibres and large-scale&#13;
sophisticated mills.   This strategy in turn led it into knitwear and&#13;
hosiery as a "downstream" outlet for manmade fibers. Courtaulds&#13;
...embarked on its strategy with some confidence that the&#13;
government would listen to it and indeed it clearly&#13;
influenced the government with its positive approach y&#13;
restructuring under a temporary protectionisy umbrella-i_&#13;
Gradually, official and ministerial opinion came to believe&#13;
that more permanent quota protection would be necessary, in an EC&#13;
context.   This view hardened in the late 1970s, as the crisis in the&#13;
textiles industry grew and the habits of cooperation between the&#13;
textiles and the clothing industry and the government developed.&#13;
The incorporation of the main economic interest groups in the&#13;
footwear industry into the process of government decisionr-making has&#13;
been less advanced, although there has been one significant example of a&#13;
new spirit at work.   In 1977, a Footwear Industry Steering Group of&#13;
officials and industry representatives noted that the "overseas trade&#13;
problem  is  a  symptom   rather   than   a  cause  of  the   industry's&#13;

difficulty,'"1  although it nonetheless saw a role for import controls&#13;
and drew attention to the "maldistribution in the balance between&#13;
manufacturing and distribution."2/  At about the same time, the Price&#13;
Commission found that, while the British Shoe Corporation (BSC), the&#13;
dominant retailer-manufacturer, was the most efficient firm in the&#13;
industry, it was also making "excessive" profits. The Commission sought&#13;
price cuts.  The recommendations did not unduly concern the BSC, which&#13;
saw that it could cut its prices by selling more cheap imports and, at&#13;
the same time, expand its market share;  The Price Commission in fact&#13;
anticipated this move and, witth the Office of Fair Trading (responsible&#13;
for legislation on monopolies), established that any expansion by the&#13;
BSC, which had been frozen since 1972 under a threat of a reference to&#13;
the Monopolies Commission, would not be curbed.&#13;
However, such a market-oriented solution to the problem was&#13;
totally at odds with what the industry lobby wanted.  The Minister of&#13;
Prices responded by turning the Commission's recommendations on their&#13;
head:   price cuts would not be imposed on the BSC if it would agree to&#13;
make a greater effort to "buy British."  The Economist acidly observed&#13;
at the time, "if it had happened in Japan it would be condemned as a new&#13;
non-tariff barrier to trade."&#13;
Despite the abolition of the Price Commission, the general&#13;
understanding subsequently reached -- and dignified with the name of the&#13;
Retail Commitment -- has remained effective to this day.&#13;

It might have been thought that with a new government so&#13;
committed to free market ideas and explicitly rejecttng 'corporatism" in&#13;
other contexts (such as incomes policy), these trends in decision-making&#13;
would have been reversed. However, in the trade field the belief seems&#13;
to have persisted that if a policy is good for Courtaulds and Marks and&#13;
Spencer -- and the trades unions, also -- it must be good for Britain.&#13;

Chapter VI&#13;
POLICY CONCLUSIONS&#13;
A great deal has been written, based on general principles and&#13;
the experiences of different countries, about the "positive" adjustment&#13;
policies that governments could instit te to facilitate the adaptation&#13;
of the industrial structure in response to international competition,&#13;
while minimizing the costs of adjustment.!'  It is worth making a few&#13;
specific points here. First, all four industries have enjoyed somewhat&#13;
greater protection against overseas competition than the manufacturing&#13;
average. Only rarely have the reasons been stated explicitly. However,&#13;
they boil  down  to  two:   first,  a modified version of the "infant&#13;
industry" argument for protection, and, second, the argument that the&#13;
costs of rapid adjustment exceed the community benefits from trade,&#13;
necessitating a slowidown in trade-induced changes.&#13;
The former has some plausibility only in the case of consumer&#13;
electronics, though legitimate queries might be raised about the&#13;
eventual outcome there.   International experience also suggests that&#13;
attempts to achieve reversals in factor intensities in traditional, low&#13;
technology, labor-intensive industries are futile and expensive in terms&#13;
of resources 2/&#13;

The latter argument is more understandable, especially in times&#13;
of high unemployment, and is supported by orthodox welfare analysis,&#13;
which points to the merits of withdrawing protection by stages rather&#13;
than all at once.1!   Justification on these grounds does,  however,&#13;
require  that  no  new  resources  enter  the  industry,   especially&#13;
investment. The lack of any stch restraint in protected U.K. industries&#13;
(or of any apparent awareness of the need) suggests some confusion over&#13;
the objectives of using protection.&#13;
A second point is that the major force in protectionr-seeking&#13;
behavior has been business.   While trade restraints (and alternative&#13;
policies) are usually rationalized in terms of employment, in practice&#13;
that reason is probably less important than whether the firms themselves&#13;
have satisfactory escape routes or can derive profits from protection.&#13;
While it can hardly be expected that governments would use the&#13;
taxpayers' money on a large scale to compensate firms to induce them to&#13;
quit a protected activity, an approach they have followed with workers,&#13;
various other options are open. Financial support could be provided, as&#13;
it has been in the past, to the woolen and cotton textile firms to write&#13;
off capacity, this assistance should, however, be subject to a condition&#13;
not imposed in the past -- that additional capacity not be added in&#13;
activities which rely upon protection, unless a clear 'infant industry"&#13;
case can be made. Both financial support and technical assistance could&#13;
be provided to enable small firms to diversify, as is being done for&#13;

clothing and footwear.   Most firms would probably prefer freedom from&#13;
restrictions rather than assistance: freedom from exchange restrictions&#13;
on overseas investment; freedom to engage in offshore processing outside&#13;
of quota limitations; and freedom for large firms to diversify through&#13;
conglomerate mergers and takeovers.&#13;
There is one major adjustment problem that the labor-specific&#13;
industries in question face -- the relatively large numbers of usually&#13;
immobile,  semi-skilled  women  workers.    Little  empirical  work  is&#13;
available that shows, through tracer studies, what the effects of&#13;
closures are on women workers specifically. It is perhaps reasonable to&#13;
assume that industrial contraction imposes somewhat smaller private or&#13;
social costs on these employees, many of whom are second earners in a&#13;
family, than they do for steel car or shipyard workers, as two examples,&#13;
and traditionally their turnover has been high. At the same time, there&#13;
will be costs unless the local labor markets -- and demand in the&#13;
service sector in particular -- are buoyant.  Traditional remedies for&#13;
increasing mobility (trying to improve the housing market, for example)&#13;
are of little relevance here; within local labor markets, the job choice&#13;
is probably more a function of the cost and availability of public&#13;
transport.&#13;
The concept of adjustment used here is microeconomic in&#13;
character.   It embodies an assumption that no prolonged, fundamental&#13;
disequilibrium  exists  in  the economy as a whole.   Yet  in several&#13;
industries, the indications were clear that the firms saw their&#13;
salvation in a shift from the production of traded goods of any kind to&#13;
non-traded services (distribution) or the acquisition of overseas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
assets. This suggests a lack of incentive to move into the production&#13;
of traded goods and services in whihh Britain has a comparative&#13;
advantage, probably the result of a seriously overvalued real effective&#13;
exchange rate. Protection of weak industries is clearly no answer -- at&#13;
the margin, it exerts upward pressure on the exchange rate and worsens&#13;
the trade-off between employment and inflation. However, it is all too&#13;
understandable why firms and workers in individual industries should&#13;
seek their individual salvation this way.&#13;

            Economics and the politics of protection :
            some case studies of industries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report is part of an inquiry
            undertaken by the World Bank in conjunction with scholars
            from 12 industrial countries into the penetration of the
            markets of industrial countries by exports of manufactures
            from developing countries. The project sought to establish
            the shares of industrial country markets held by the
            developing countries, changes in such shares in the 1970s,
            and why they vary among industry groups and countries. The
            aim is to assist developing and industrial countries to
            improve their policies through a better understanding of
            trade patterns and protectionist pressures. To a great
            extent, protectionist behavior is industry-specific, with
            several factors relevant in determining an industry's
            attitude toward protection. Among them are the intensity and
            nature of the competition it faces, its adjustment options
            and capacity to adjust, and its success in lobbying the
            government for protection. This paper analyzes these factors
            for four different industries in Great Britain: footwear,
            knitwear, cutlery and consumer electronics. Each has faced
            substantial import competition from developing countries and
            has received varying degrees of protection that in all cases
            have been higher than the U.K. average for manufacturing.
            The paper also looks at the factors that may determine
            whether the government adopts a protectionist policy, with
            specific attention to the four industries.
