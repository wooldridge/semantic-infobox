Identifying Constraints to Increasing Sanitation Coverage&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation Demand and&#13;
Supply in Cambodia&#13;
&#13;
Analysis of the sanitation supply chain and household sanitation demand shows that growth in&#13;
coverage can be stimulated by making sanitation products and services more available, attractive&#13;
and affordable while at the same time overcoming the prevalent high-end facility preference.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Developing market strategies that supply the required information, products&#13;
 and service and that focus on demand creation among consumers may&#13;
 contribute to increased sanitation coverage in Cambodia.&#13;

&#13;
The demand and supply surveys were&#13;
undertaken in both rural and urban&#13;
settings. The rural areas surveyed were&#13;
in Kandal, Siem Reap, and Svay Rieng&#13;
provinces, and the urban locations were&#13;
Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Svay Rieng&#13;
towns (see Figure 1 for a map of the&#13;
project areas). This survey area&#13;
encompassed a range of socio-economic&#13;
and environmental conditions that are&#13;
broadly representative of rural and urban&#13;
areas in Cambodia. In addition they&#13;
include areas with high, medium, and low&#13;
access to sanitation. Two villages which&#13;
had been involved in Community Led&#13;
Total Sanitation (CLTS) programs were&#13;
purposefully included because of the&#13;
interest in complementarities between&#13;
CLTS programs and market strategies.&#13;

The demand survey covered a total of&#13;
41 villages and 939 households which&#13;
included both latrine owners and&#13;
non-owners. In addition, six focus group&#13;

                                                How can we use importer and wholesaler information for marketing purposes?&#13;
&#13;
Importers and wholesalers are enterprises&#13;
that import construction materials (e.g.        The importers/wholesalers are critical to the overall availability of construction materials in&#13;
&#13;
cement, ceramic pans, PVC tubing,               Cambodia, and they do provide (1) a conduit to making available cheaper latrine&#13;

Nearly all construction materials used in     Sales figures for latrine pans average              No examples were found of retailers having&#13;

Retailers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Retailers are typically family-owned&#13;
shops in urban or rural markets that sell&#13;
construction materials including latrine&#13;
components. There is usually more than&#13;
one in each local market, creating a&#13;
competitive retail environment, especially&#13;
in the provincial town markets. About&#13;
60% of the rural retailers' latrine-pan&#13;
sales occur in the dry season, coinciding&#13;

                                                                                                    7&#13;

   How can we use concrete producer information for marketing purposes?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Producers' income is highly dependent on latrine sales, giving them a strong incentive to develop increased demand, and positioning them as a&#13;
&#13;
   good source of information for consumers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Concrete rings and slabs made by producers are all of the same basic type, and there have been limited attempts to innovate simpler and&#13;
&#13;
   cheaper approaches (ferrocement, bamboo-reinforced concrete, etc.) under Cambodian conditions. Design innovations could be introduced&#13;
&#13;
   via these producers, hence increasing the range of design choices available to consumers.&#13;

Masons are construction workers who                                                                      for marketing purposes?&#13;

&#13;
construction can be divided into two              dependent with the dry season&#13;
parts: for the substructure which includes        accounting for about 60% of latrine&#13;
digging the pit and installing the concrete       constructions.                                       of any formal training, and hence their&#13;
rings, slab, and pan ­ ranging from $25                                                                ability to communicate latrine design&#13;
to $50; and for the superstructure                Similar to the prefabricated concrete                information and choices to consumers&#13;
including the shelter walls, roof, and door       producers, the percentage of income that             is limited. Even with the right design&#13;
­ ranging from $50 to $150. These rates           masons derive specifically from latrine              information, the quality of construction&#13;
are prohibitively expensive for much of           constructions is relatively high,                    is generally poor, due to both cost-cutting&#13;
Cambodia's population, and many                   accounting for about 30% of the annual               as well as the level of technical ability.&#13;
households therefore opt to construct             income in rural areas. This fact could&#13;
latrines on their own, or with only partially     motivate masons to actively participate&#13;
hired assistance. Thus households tend            in promotional activities. However, the&#13;
to manage the construction themselves,            demand survey revealed a significant&#13;

materials ­ in only 20% of the surveyed           and within the supply chain, with retailers&#13;
households did the masons purchase                citing masons as a common source of&#13;
materials on their behalf.                        bad debt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is a large demand for masons in             At present, masons' knowledge of&#13;
urban areas, enticing rural masons to             latrine design is very low due to a lack&#13;

&#13;
Among households interviewed during&#13;
the field studies that already had a             Shelters:&#13;
latrine, the most popular design in both&#13;
rural and urban areas comprises of: an&#13;
offset tank - most commonly constructed&#13;
as a soakaway pit with concrete rings ­&#13;
(80% of rural and 72% of urban latrines&#13;
surveyed); a pour-flush slab (87% of rural&#13;
and 97% urban latrines); concrete/brick&#13;
walls (66% of rural and 67% of urban&#13;
                                                 Slab &amp; Pans:&#13;
latrines), and a galvanized steel roof&#13;
(76% of rural and 74 % of urban latrines).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Thus, by far the majority of latrines&#13;
surveyed were of a near identical high-&#13;
end, high-cost design, and interestingly         Pits/Tanks:&#13;
this was the case across all income&#13;
groupings. This is surprising given that&#13;
cost was cited as the most prohibitive&#13;
factor for latrine ownership, and the cost&#13;
of this type of latrine ($150 upward) is&#13;
more than ten times the cost of the&#13;
simplest designs ($5 - $10 using&#13;
un-costed family labor and locally&#13;
                                                Latrines have essentially three components and can be constructed with any&#13;

                                                (2) a latrine slab which incorporates the latrine pan or hole, and (3) the below-&#13;

1. Overcoming the perception of an&#13;
&#13;
     ` ideal' design&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The perception of an ideal design seems&#13;
to be deep-rooted, and whilst it is&#13;
challenging to overcome, it is perhaps&#13;
the most critical block to increased latrine&#13;
purchase. Further qualitative consumer&#13;
research into this perception should be&#13;
undertaken prior to designing strategies&#13;
to address it. For the moment, we can&#13;
consider what we already know or can&#13;
speculate from the existing research,&#13;
                                              would need time to save and most of         Lower entry-cost upgradeable designs&#13;

roles, and with different interests. Whilst&#13;
men and women could therefore be&#13;
targeted separately, it is also important to&#13;
encourage household discussion&#13;
between men and women on the subject&#13;
of latrine ownership.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Communication materials should seek to&#13;
reposition latrines higher up the ranking&#13;
of desired purchases to instill a greater&#13;
urgency toward latrine construction.&#13;
Whilst almost all non-owners would like a&#13;
latrine, they would also like to own other&#13;
things ­ 10% of rural households own a&#13;
DVD player and 63% a television - hence&#13;
the latrine acquisition is competing for&#13;
savings against other expenditures: 19%&#13;

            Identifying constraints to increasing
            sanitation coverage : sanitation demand and supply in Cambodia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This field note summarizes research from
            two studies undertaken in rural and peri-urban areas of
            Cambodia; one on the demand for latrines among consumers,
            and the other on the supply of latrines by the private
            sector. It provides discussion on the opportunity to
            increase latrine purchase and installation via market
            forces, and outlines the recommended interventions on both
            the demand and supply dimensions of the market to achieve this.
