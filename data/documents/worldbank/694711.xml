POLAND&#13;
MUNICIPAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
CHAPTER I: THE SECTOR&#13;
A.    Decentralization of Public Services&#13;
1.    The Economic Transformation Program (ETP) launched by Poland in 1990 has been successful in&#13;
engaging the restructuring of the Polish economy, reducing inflation and initiating from 1992, a path of&#13;
economic recovery. Output growth averaged 6.1 percent in 1994-96. However, despite the great need to&#13;
modernize Poland's infrastructure and public services, public investment declined from, on average, 5.5&#13;
percent of GDP in 1986-88 to 3.9 percent in 1990 and 2.9 percent in 1996.&#13;
2.     Under the Local Self-Government Act (LSGA) of 1990, Poland transferred to over 2,400&#13;
municipalities (gminy) the provision of a broad range of local infrastructure and services including water&#13;
and sanitation, drainage, land development, urban streets, mass transit, and district heating. Further&#13;
decentralization reforms are underway or being considered, such as the creation of a second, county-level&#13;
tier of local government (the powiats), and the devolution of new functions in the social, educational and&#13;
cultural sectors. Decentralization is seen as a means to deepen democratic processes at the local level and&#13;
bring decisions on local services closer to the beneficiaries.&#13;
3.     By and large, Polish gminy have risen to the challenge of their expanded role under the LSGA and&#13;
taken charge for the services devolved. A number of cities and towns have engaged in restructuring their&#13;
municipal services bodies into corporate utilities, and have adopted responsible service pricing policies that&#13;
required politically painful increases in user charges. Gminy have also played a key role in small-scale&#13;
privatization by divesting property and commercial assets. Local budgets have generated sizeable current&#13;
savings, and the municipal sector now accounts for over one half of total public investment. Improving the&#13;
efficiency, coverage, management and pricing of municipal services is a long-term effort, however, and&#13;
progress varies sharply across gminy. Many towns have a long way to go in restructuring municipal&#13;
enterprises, adopting modem financial management and planning tools, spinning off non-core businesses&#13;
(such as construction and engineering departments), and bringing user charges to a level that makes local&#13;
utilities financially self-reliant. And the present level of municipal investment still falls short of the needs.&#13;
4.     Poland's decentralization is not complete, and further transfers of tasks are placing new burdens on&#13;
local resources. The devolution of primary schools, started in 1992 on a voluntary basis, was extended to&#13;
all gminy in 1996. Additional tasks in health care, secondary education, road maintenance, cultural&#13;
institutions were transferred to 47 large cities and towns in 2 metropolitan agglomerations in 1994, under a&#13;
pilot program. Since 1996, this change has been made permanent for 46 large cities and the local&#13;
authorities of the City of Warsaw, according to the provisions of the "Big City Law" of November 1995.&#13;
From 1995, gminy became responsible for the allocation of housing subsidies to low-income households, a&#13;
charge which absorbs up to 10 percent of local revenues. These new expenditure mandates have not&#13;
necessarily been matched with a commensurate devolution of revenues (particularly in the case of the Big&#13;
City Law), and they could be placing increased stress on municipal budgets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
B.    Agency Responsibilities in Central Government&#13;
5.     Poland does not have a ministry specifically in charge of municipal affairs, and gminy deal with&#13;
different departments or agencies of the central government depending on the activity concerned.  The&#13;
Ministry of Finance (MoF)--which created a separate Municipal Finance Department in 1996--calculates&#13;
and distributes the general subsidy, collects and transfers to gminy their proceeds of shared taxes (through&#13;
its regional tax offices), and monitors municipal budgets and compliance with debt limits. Seventeen&#13;
Regional Audit Chambers (RIO) are responsible for compliance auditing of municipal budgets. They also&#13;
issue opinions on municipal borrowings at the request of lenders, and have been a source of information and&#13;
training for municipalities, in particular for changes in administrative law.&#13;
6.     A number of sectoral ministries (e.g., Construction, Education, Environment) have separate&#13;
programs, with minimal coordination among them, to support municipal development in each of their&#13;
sectors. Likewise, responsibilities to formulate new policies on municipal affairs have been diffuse. During&#13;
1992-94 the Council of Ministers' Office of Public Administration Reform led decentralization efforts, such&#13;
as the powiat program, but its role has been more limited recently. In 1993, the Government created a Joint&#13;
Central-Local Government Committee composed in equal numbers of central government officials and&#13;
municipal representatives, as a forum for discussion of decentralization issues. The Committee promoted&#13;
the creation of a Municipal Development Agency (MDA), which was legally established as a foundation&#13;
and started operating in 1995. The MDA's objectives are to provide advice, information and technical&#13;
support to help grniny strengthen their management capacities, prepare viable projects, and mobilize&#13;
investment finance.&#13;
7.     At the regional level, the 49 voivodships (deconcentrated branches of the central government)&#13;
channel central support and guidance to their constituent gminy.  The voivodships have significant&#13;
discretion, within their resource limits, in allocating matching grants to municipal projects.  Each&#13;
voivodship has an assembly composed of gminy representatives, which provides feedback to the (centrally&#13;
appointed) voivod on municipal priorities and has an important consultative input on, inter alia, grant&#13;
allocation.&#13;
C.    Municipal Finance and Management&#13;
8.     Annex I gives details of recent trends in local revenues and expenditures. As of 1996, municipal&#13;
expenditures in Poland represented 8.3 percent of GDP, equivalent to 14 percent of total public&#13;
expenditures. Municipal investment was a much higher share (55 percent) of total government investment.&#13;
This ratio of municipal to total government capital expenditures is relatively high by middle-income&#13;
country standards, but reflects the low overall level of public investment in recent years and the capital-&#13;
intensive nature of the main services devolved to gminy.&#13;
9.     On average, own-source revenues account for about 40 percent of the municipal budgets. These&#13;
include local taxes (real estate, agriculture, transport, business license, etc.) and duties, income from the sale&#13;
and lease of municipal property, interest income, and transfers of profits from municipal enterprises. The&#13;
main source of own revenues is the property tax (11 percent of the municipal budgets in 1996). Gminy have&#13;
partial discretion in setting property tax rates, up to a national cap. The property tax is levied on a flat per&#13;
square meter rate regardless of location values, which limits its potential. Moving to an ad-valorem&#13;
property tax is a medium-term objective, requiring considerable work in preparing property cadasters and&#13;
valuation methods. Only a few cities, such as Krakow, have made significant progress towards this&#13;
objective, which also requires new legislation. The balance of municipal revenues consists of shared taxes&#13;
(municipalities accrue 15 percent of the personal and 5 percent of the corporate income tax), a block&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
equalization grant, transfers for delegated tasks such as education and cost-sharing (matching) grants for&#13;
investments in selected sectors, as well as an additional share of 6-8 percent of the personal income tax for&#13;
cities covered by the Big City Law.&#13;
10.    The financial position of Polish gminy varies across regions, by city size (with smaller and medium-&#13;
sized cities doing better overall than the largest cities or small towns--see Annex 1), and also according to&#13;
the capacities and reform orientation of local officials. It has also varied from year to year, mainly as the&#13;
result of changes in the inter-governmental allocation of revenues and expenditure. The important point is,&#13;
however, that in a period of considerable uncertainty, the sector as a whole has maintained a positive and&#13;
steady flow of current savings, equivalent to about 22-25 percent of revenues, and has been able to maintain&#13;
a significant pace of investment, largely on a self-financing basis. Gminy need to generate still higher&#13;
savings to support their large investment needs, take on new tasks, and replace the one-off revenue source&#13;
that they have been getting from asset sales. However, the change required is incremental rather than a&#13;
qualitative jump.  In this sense, Poland's municipal sector contrasts with those of many transition&#13;
economies, where local revenues cover only a small fraction of the needs (as in all FSU countries and&#13;
southern Central Europe), or have been subjected to sharp annual swings reflecting central fiscal constraints&#13;
(as in Hungary, for instance).&#13;
11.    Gminy have made considerable progress in a few years in budget preparation, presentation and&#13;
compliance. Financial analysis tools and skills are still insufficiently developed, however, and multi-year&#13;
financial planning, beyond the annual budget cycle, is performed in few cities. The budgetary classification&#13;
system elaborated by the Ministry of Finance until now has been geared to the needs of central monitoring&#13;
rather than local management, and disclosure standards have not been designed with the objective of&#13;
documenting creditworthiness. The Ministry is, however, aware of the need to revise this system and, as of&#13;
the last quarter of 1997, intends to incorporate municipal debt indicators in the budgetary indicators&#13;
requested from gminy.&#13;
12.    Even more than their municipal owners, local utilities and service enterprises vary considerably in&#13;
their organizational form and in the quality of their management. Few Polish towns so far have privatized&#13;
utility operations (Gdansk water), but private involvement is now being sought more actively, especially for&#13;
solid waste. Even without private involvement, many gminy have transformed their service enterprises into&#13;
business-like, corporate utilities (joint-stock or more frequently limited-liability companies), with clear&#13;
delineation of roles and accounts between the company and its municipal owner/regulator. Most utilities&#13;
are able to recover their recurrent costs from user charges, and in some sectors such as water supply, they&#13;
generate a sizeable cash flow which should enable sustained investment in service expansion and&#13;
improvement.&#13;
13.    Still, the in-depth restructuring needed to raise efficiency in service provision has barely started in&#13;
the municipal utilities sector.  Being sheltered from competitive pressures, many municipal enterprises&#13;
have raised their rates or deferred service improvements rather than cut recurrent costs and reduce their&#13;
generally oversized work-forces. A large number of medium-sized or small cities have missed, with no&#13;
apparent consequences, a succession of legal deadlines for defining the future status of their utilities, which&#13;
are still operated largely as departments of the municipal administration and without clear bottom lines.&#13;
And in the absence of long-term credit, utilities cannot become fully self-reliant financially--they still&#13;
depend largely on investment grants or equity contributions from the municipal budgets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
D.     Municipal Investment&#13;
14.    In 1996, aggregate gmina investment reached 1.5 percent of Poland's GDP. Given its wide sectoral&#13;
scope (which includes capital-intensive services), and in spite of the relatively high ratio of municipal to&#13;
total government capital expenditures, Poland's municipal sector needs to invest more--probably between 2-&#13;
3 percent of GDP--with water and wastewater alone accounting for about 1.5 percent.&#13;
15.    As do most transition countries of Central Europe, Poland has a high coverage of local&#13;
infrastructure in relation to its income level. Piped water and waste collection are almost universally&#13;
available in urban areas, with no widespread service disruptions, and street and transit networks are highly&#13;
developed. Nevertheless, major investments are needed, with potentially high economic returns, to: (a)&#13;
clear a backlog of deferred maintenance and overdue asset renewal; (b) address a legacy of past&#13;
environmental neglect, and to comply with stringent EU environmental standards, by expanding and&#13;
upgrading sewage treatment and solid waste disposal facilities, and retrofitting heat supply plants; (c)&#13;
undertake optimization investment, especially to conserve energy and water in utilities networks; (d) in the&#13;
urban transport sector, respond to the fast growth of car ownership and mitigate related congestion and&#13;
environmental risks; and (e) address bottlenecks in the provision of infrastructure for new housing.&#13;
16.    The sectoral distribution of municipal investment is not well documented, as national statistics&#13;
aggregate many sub-sectors into one big item called "municipal economy". Based on a survey of a small&#13;
sample of localities, the main sectors of investment in 1993 were sewage treatment (17 percent), water&#13;
supply (15 percent), sewage collection (8 percent), education (14 percent), and streets (8 percent). The high&#13;
share of environmental services (water and waste) reflects not only local priorities, but also a greater&#13;
availability of concessional finance for these sectors. By far the main source of funds for local government&#13;
investment has been their current savings--as reflected in an aggregate self-financing ratio of 102 percent in&#13;
1995. Other sources include grants from voivodships, central ministries, and grants or subsidized loans&#13;
from the environmental funds (see below). Other than soft loans for environmental projects, the use of&#13;
credit for municipal investment has been negligible. The absence of long-term municipal credit from&#13;
commercial sources has been a hurdle to local investment, especially for "lumpy" infrastructure projects&#13;
with long asset life that cannot easily be funded from current savings on a pay-as-you-go basis. It reflects&#13;
weaknesses both in the municipal sector, which has difficulty proving its creditworthiness, and in the&#13;
financial sector, which has been unable to appraise municipal risk or generate term finance with maturities&#13;
suitable for infrastructure projects.&#13;
E.     Environmental Finance&#13;
17.    Poland has a highly developed system of national, regional and municipal environmental funds&#13;
(NFOS, WFOS and GFOS), which has been established to accelerate the country's cleanup and protection&#13;
effort by putting a price--positive or negative--on environmental externalities. The system, led by the&#13;
Ministry of the Environment, is based on the collection of polluter charges and fees for the use of natural&#13;
resources such as water, and the recycling of these fees as matching grants or low-interest loan contributions&#13;
in support of environmental protection investments by industries, municipalities or utilities. The fees,&#13;
equivalent to almost 0.4 percent of GDP, are collected at the voivodship level. The local voivodship and&#13;
gmina (municipal) environmental funds retain, on aggregate, about 60 percent of the proceeds, which are&#13;
used to support projects that have mainly local benefits. The remaining 40 percent is transferred to NFOS,&#13;
which concentrates on larger investments, or projects that have an impact across voivodship boundaries.&#13;
NFOS also receives support from extemal donors including the EU. NFOS provides most of its&#13;
contributions in the form of subsidized-rate loans, with typical maturities of 4-5 years, a I to 2 year grace&#13;
period, and interest rates as low as 0.2 to 0.6 of the National Bank of Poland's refinance rate. In addition, up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
to 50 percent of principal repayment can be forgiven by NFOS if a project meets agreed conditions (such as&#13;
timely project completion and debt service).&#13;
18.    Together, the environmental funds have been by far the largest source of national and regional&#13;
support to municipal investment, and almost the only source of term credit to the municipal sector. They&#13;
have provided a major boost--unique among transition countries--to the pace of expansion and improvement&#13;
of local services, especially for sewage treatment. The focus and effectiveness of this system could be&#13;
further improved, however. The management of NFOS has been strengthened in recent years, but the&#13;
WFOS are weaker institutionally. The use of more explicit lending criteria, defined up-front, would&#13;
improve transparency and help beneficiaries design their financing plans at an earlier stage of project&#13;
preparation. Overall, Poland's strong environmental finance system could leverage its resources further,&#13;
having the environmental funds operate more as co-financiers alongside commercial sources, with the&#13;
provision of soft loans limited, in a transparent fashion, to the environmental externality they finance.&#13;
F.     Status of the Financial Sector, Municipal Credit&#13;
19.    Since 1990, Poland has transformed its banking system from a virtual appendix of the Central&#13;
Planning Office into a free market-type banking system with an adequate regulatory framework and an&#13;
increasingly effective supervisory authority. The Treasury still owns over two-thirds of the banking sector&#13;
(total assets as of December 1996 amounted to US$57 billion), but there has been a surge in the number of&#13;
private and foreign participants. Of the nine regionally-based commercial banks that were initially spun off&#13;
from the Central Bank, four have been privatized, one more (PBK) is expected to be privatized in the next&#13;
3-6 months, and another is expected to be privatized in 1998. The sector also includes about 1,500 small&#13;
cooperative banks (representing about 3 percent of banking assets) servicing mostly rural areas and towns,&#13;
and four large specialized banks. One of these four, Bank Handlowy, has diversified itself beyond foreign&#13;
trade and become a profitable universal bank. Privatization of this bank is scheduled to take place during&#13;
1997. Another one, PKO SA, was, in 1996, consolidated with the remaining three state-owned commercial&#13;
banks and will be privatized in 1998. The other specialized banks, the housing and savings bank (PKO BP)&#13;
and the rural bank (BGZ), which inherited troubled loan portfolios in socially complicated sectors, have&#13;
been heavily re-capitalized over the last few years, and the future viability of BGZ is still uncertain.&#13;
20.    New lending by banks had been limited, until at least 1994, reflecting improved supervision and&#13;
awareness of credit risk, lack of appraisal experience, inadequate collateral arrangements, large government&#13;
borrowing needs, and the uncertain prospects of most candidate borrowers in the early contraction years of&#13;
the transformation program. During that period, banks invested the bulk of their resources in Treasury&#13;
Bills. However, with increased competition for deposits and falling yields on treasuries, the banks are now&#13;
facing reduced spreads, and are seeking more active and profitable types of lending. After falling for four&#13;
years in real terms, bank credit (excluding credit to central government) increased by 11 percent (in real&#13;
terms) in 1995 and by a further 29 percent in 1996.&#13;
21.    Over the past two years, Polish banks have started to take an active interest in the municipal sector,&#13;
which they see as a potential market for relatively safe lending with higher spreads than central government&#13;
financing. Municipal lending has increased considerably since 1994. Aggregate outstanding municipal&#13;
debt increased from PLN 83 million in the first quarter of 1994 to PLN 425 million in the first quarter of&#13;
1996. By end-August 1996, this had risen to PLN 514 million. With this increase, the sources of financing&#13;
have started to change and the maturity of loans has been lengthening. In early 1995, over 90 percent of&#13;
credits to gminy with maturities beyond one year were disbursed by the environmental funds. By end-&#13;
August 1996, this percentage had fallen to about 70 percent with 20 percent originating from the 9 regional&#13;
banks, and loans with maturities of more than one year exceeded shorter-term loans. The main constraint&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
for commercial lending to municipalities, however, continues to be that, while municipal borrowers require&#13;
long-term loans to match the life of their infrastructure assets, bank liabilities are strongly skewed towards&#13;
short-dated instruments. Issuing longer-term loans would expose bank treasuries to refinance risks which&#13;
could become serious in a liquidity crisis. And even though the use of floating-rate loans reduces the&#13;
interest rate risk for the banks, shifting this risk to the borrowers raises the risk of credit defaults. Other&#13;
constraints for long-term commercial loans to municipalities are: poor collateral arrangements; lack of&#13;
experience in assessing municipal credit risk; and competition from subsidized sources of municipal&#13;
financing (primarily, environmental funds).&#13;
22.    Non-bank sources of municipal credit are likely to acquire greater significance, as is increasingly&#13;
the case with non-bank financing of firms. Among the most significant developments in the fixed-income&#13;
market in Poland is the recent emergence of quasi-commercial paper of domestic firms, issued by&#13;
investment banks. This constitutes a growing (albeit still small) source of competition to commercial bank&#13;
loans. More recently, and in line with the passage of a new Bond Law (July 1995), some large cities have&#13;
taken steps towards the private placement of short-to-medium-term municipal bonds. Gdynia successfully&#13;
placed its first bonds in January 1996, followed by Krakow, Lodz and Gdansk later in the year. However,&#13;
the issuance of municipal bonds (particularly, in the case of more liquid public issues) entails significant&#13;
fixed costs associated with: information disclosure, obtaining a credit rating, costly marketing and complex&#13;
collateral arrangements. As a result, bond issues are likely to be attractive mainly for larger gminy and their&#13;
revenue-earning utilities, while bank lending may be more effective for smaller and medium-sized&#13;
borrowers.&#13;
23.    With continued economic growth, gradually falling inflation and increased competition among&#13;
intermediaries and financial services firms (partly as a result of recent OECD membership and prospective&#13;
EU accession and partly as a result of progressive--albeit slow--privatization of banks), Poland's financial&#13;
sector has a favorable outlook over the medium term, and should be able within the next few years to extend&#13;
access to credit, with gradually longer maturities, to well-managed borrowers--whether these are&#13;
municipalities or businesses. Development of institutional investors, such as mutual and pension funds,&#13;
could further boost the supply of long-term  savings in the economy. However, the development of&#13;
municipal credit will require specific developments in municipal management, municipal collateral, and&#13;
banking skills.&#13;
G.    Issues of Municipal Creditworthiness - Government Strategy&#13;
24.    The main hurdles to establishing municipal creditworthiness relate to the ability of gmniny to prepare&#13;
and document bankable projects; revenues with insufficient predictability to back multi-year debt&#13;
commitments; their lack of an established credit record; and their limited ability to provide viable security&#13;
packages to lenders or bondholders:&#13;
*      First, most gmniny and local utilities lack project experience, and they need technical&#13;
support in selecting and preparing projects supported by credible feasibility studies&#13;
(addressing not just technical choices, but also documenting the sustainability of the&#13;
arrangements proposed to operate project facilities and recover their costs).   A&#13;
strengthening of utilities and their local govemment supervisors is also needed, e.g.,&#13;
through adoption of corporate status, appointing non-political members to utility boards.&#13;
*      Second, in view of continuing uncertainties on inter-govemmental fiscal relationships,&#13;
credit backed by general municipal obligations should be approached prudently in the&#13;
coming years, with conservative financial assumptions and high debt coverage ratios.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Credit backed by utility revenues should be more attractive in the near future. Gminy can&#13;
help their own utilities become financially more predictable (and creditworthy), by giving&#13;
them a corporate status with substantial management autonomy, and by entering into&#13;
formal multi-year indexed price cap agreements with them, in order to reduce perceived&#13;
regulatory risk for lenders.'&#13;
And third, legal work and pilot experiments are needed to introduce the use of municipal&#13;
revenues as a secure form of loan or bond collateral -- experience from other countries&#13;
shows this to be a key driver in the emergence of municipal credit markets, and alternatives&#13;
such as the pledging of municipal property are less effective.&#13;
25.    Through the proposed municipal project and complementary programs financed by EU-Phare,&#13;
USAID, British Know-How Fund and other donors, the Government of Poland intends to act on the above&#13;
fronts. It has created the MDA and mobilized donor-funded technical assistance (EU, USAID) to help&#13;
municipalities prepare projects and develop their financial planning skills. Existing Polish legislation also&#13;
limits the municipality's ratio of unsecured debt service to revenues to 15 percent. On a highly selective&#13;
basis, it is providing guarantees for viable, well-prepared municipal investment projects that have a&#13;
demonstration effect. A team of lawyers contracted through the MDA is working on municipal collateral&#13;
issues. And the Government has requested Bank support to prepare and finance a time-bound, pilot-scale&#13;
credit program, with funds channeled through the banking sector, in order to establish an experience in term&#13;
finance for municipal investments.&#13;
I   The rates for municipal utilities are not generally indexed for inflation--any adjustment, even nominal, still&#13;
requires approval of the full City Council. The open-ended nature of this process is a deterrent for lenders. Multi-&#13;
year indexed rate cap agreements are being introduced for utilities who borrow directly from IBRD, such as Aqua,&#13;
the water company of Bielsko Biala.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER II: THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Origin&#13;
26.    Since 1991, the Government and the Bank have had a continuing dialogue on fiscal&#13;
decentralization, municipal development and local infrastructure. Bank inputs include a 1992 report on&#13;
Decentralization and Reform of the State, sector work on urban transport, heat supply and water and&#13;
sewerage, dedicated sections in the 1994 CEM, and support through an IDF grant for a survey of local&#13;
investment and studies of further decentralization steps. The Bank's 1992 Decentralization Report flagged&#13;
the need for an institution to coordinate training and technical assistance efforts in the municipal sector&#13;
(along the lines of the MDA), and suggested pilot-scale investment lending to initiate a market for long-&#13;
term municipal credit. The project was formally entered in the Bank's lending program in May 1994, after&#13;
the Govemment decided to create the MDA and assign to it the tasks of developing a pipeline of viable&#13;
municipal investment projects as well as supporting arrangements for financing these projects.&#13;
B.    CAS and Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
27.   The project supports two key, inter-related objectives of the country assistance strategy (CAS):&#13;
promoting private sector financing of municipal infrastructure; and helping municipalities to raise the&#13;
necessary finance to carry out their environmental responsibilities. The project will contribute to the&#13;
diversification and deepening of Poland's financial sector by facilitating private commercial bank entry in&#13;
the long-term municipal credit market. It directly supports Bank operations in the water sector by creating a&#13;
channel for "retailing" Bank funds, which is the logical next step to a series of single water and wastewater&#13;
loans. This channel will play an essential role in mobilizing donor support for a wider range of cities and&#13;
towns than could be served through direct lending, and in improving the consistency of extemally funded&#13;
programs in the sector.&#13;
28.   Through its dialogue with the Government, liaison with donors, and interaction with Polish banks&#13;
and cities, the Bank has played a significant role in supporting key steps of project development and&#13;
facilitating a consensus between the main participants. The Bank's experience, both in appraising individual&#13;
investment projects and in designing municipal sector lending instruments including innovative security&#13;
arrangements, is perceived as an important factor in enhancing the project's quality. Continued Bank&#13;
involvement is therefore essential for building confidence and maintaining the project's momentum.&#13;
C.    Project Objectives&#13;
29.   The main goal of the MFP is to promote the development of a credit market for municipal&#13;
investment in Poland. To this end, the project pursues the following two inter-related objectives. First, it&#13;
will provide long-term financial resources to commercial banks for municipal lending in the infrastructure&#13;
sector. And second, it will help the banks identify and prepare a sustained pipeline of viable investment&#13;
projects, backed by creditworthy towns or local utilities.&#13;
D.    Project Description&#13;
30.   The proposed project, a US$22 million line of credit guaranteed by the Republic of Poland, consists&#13;
of a single-currency loan to each of two selected commercial banks. The loans will finance a program of&#13;
long term subloans issued by these banks (the borrowing banks) to municipalities and revenue-earning&#13;
municipal service enterprises. The project is designed as a pilot operation to demonstrate how term-finance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
of municipal investments at commercial terms can work. All subloans will be at market terms and will&#13;
finance works, goods and services for eligible municipal infrastructure investment sub-projects for water,&#13;
wastewater, solid waste, and urban transport (including street lighting and road improvement), as well as for&#13;
education infrastructure investments. Banks will be responsible for all aspects of the management and&#13;
implementation of the loan including sub-project appraisal. The minimum size of a subloan will be&#13;
US$250,000; the maximum subloan by PBK or by a consortium of the two borrowing banks will be US$14&#13;
million. The average cost of a sub-project is, however, expected to be about US$4 million equivalent and&#13;
subloans will finance up to 75 percent of individual sub-project costs. Subloans to single final borrower&#13;
will not exceed US$14 million in the aggregate. The project will also promote the channeling of donor-&#13;
provided technical assistance resources (through the Municipal Development Agency - MDA) to market&#13;
participants including: (a) municipalities, in the areas of project preparation and financial management; (b)&#13;
banks, for appraising municipal credit and structuring robust loan security arrangements; and (c) the MDA&#13;
to strengthen its continuing role as a facilitator of municipal investment.&#13;
31.    Eligibility of borrowing banks. Borrowing banks are required to be, and to continue to be, in full&#13;
compliance with NBP regulatory and supervision requirements including standard guidelines for capital&#13;
adequacy, asset concentration, foreign exchange risk and loan provisioning. The Bank's appraisal of the&#13;
banks also focused on overall managerial capacity, policies for assessing and managing credit risk,&#13;
asset/liability risk management, training practices, profitability benchmarks, capacity to administer the&#13;
project, and consistency of their business plan with the project objectives. Private ownership, or (if not)&#13;
clear determination to be privatized over the next year, was also one of the key eligibility criteria. A more&#13;
detailed description of the eligibility criteria for the borrowing banks is provided in Annex 5. The&#13;
borrowing banks, PBK (Powszechny Bank Kredytowy SA w Warszawie) and BISE (Bank for Socio-&#13;
Economic Initiatives SA) meet all the above eligibility criteria. Several other banks were also considered as&#13;
potential borrowers under the project but were finally excluded either because they did not satisfy the&#13;
criteria--particularly with regard to privatization status--or because they were not ready to enter into a&#13;
borrowing commitment at this time. A number of banks (which are likely to meet the above criteria) did,&#13;
however, express a strong desire to participate in any later operation.&#13;
32.    PBK Bank. PBK is one of the nine Treasury-owned commercial banks spun off from the central&#13;
bank; with assets of about US$3 billion, this is one of the largest commercial banks in Poland. PBK&#13;
received extensive training and advisory assistance under a twinning arrangement with San Paolo Bank&#13;
(Turin) financed from the Financial Institutions Development Loan (Loan 3341). Most of the current top&#13;
management was appointed in 1995 and the Head Office was extensively reorganized in February 1996.&#13;
The present management of the bank is seen as more progressive than its predecessors and is actively&#13;
seeking strategic investors to participate in its privatization. This process is at an advanced stage and PBK&#13;
is scheduled for privatization in the next three-six months, with the Government retaining only a 5 percent&#13;
share to cover restitution claims. The bank, which operated originally in the Warsaw and north-eastern&#13;
regions of Poland, has recently begun expansion into other regions both through the opening of new&#13;
branches and the purchase of existing banks or their branches (the bank had 47 branches at the end of 1996).&#13;
Its strategy is based on becoming a broadly based commercial bank providing a wide range of banking and&#13;
financial services to companies, institutions (including municipalities) and individuals. While the bank's&#13;
experience in municipal lending has so far been limited, staffing and organizational arrangements to handle&#13;
the Municipal Finance Project are adequate.&#13;
33.    PBK is well capitalized (at 14.2 percent, its risk-adjusted capital-adequacy ratio is much higher than&#13;
the NBP requirement) and has been highly profitable (over 27 percent return on average equity in 1996).&#13;
About 55 percent of PBK's loans are to state-owned enterprises. Although the share is decreasing, a&#13;
significant part of this lending remains in the problematic heavy industry and coal mining sectors, a legacy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
of the 1989 NBP spin-off. However, as a result of effective work-out efforts and revised lending&#13;
procedures, "irregular" loans continued to decline from 31.6 percent in 1994 to 15.6 percent in 1996; and all&#13;
irregular loans are adequately provisioned according to NBP requirements. With regard to liquidity, the&#13;
bank has a substantial share of Treasury Bills in its balance sheet; this provides a substantial cushion to&#13;
compensate for a substantial asset-liability maturity mismatch. To the extent that most assets carry a&#13;
floating interest rate, the interest rate risk of the maturity mismatch is limited. The bank also has a balanced&#13;
overall foreign exchange position. A more detailed description of the bank and review of its activities is&#13;
provided in Annex 6.&#13;
34.    BISE Bank BISE is a relatively small (assets of about US$49 million in 1996) and over-capitalized&#13;
bank (equity was about 40 percent of liabilities in 1996); it has specialized in lending to small businesses&#13;
and, to a lesser degree, to municipalities. About 56 percent of BISE's equity is in private hands (Credit&#13;
Foncier, Credit Industriel d'Alsace et de Lorraine and Caisse Centrale de Credit Cooperatif of France are&#13;
the three largest private shareholders). BISE's original purpose was to provide financial support to the&#13;
development of small businesses and to stimulate development of small towns and rural communities.&#13;
About 77 percent of BISE's loans are to private sector companies and individuals, 22 percent are to&#13;
government entities (primarily municipal), and I percent to state-owned enterprises.  The French&#13;
shareholders have provided, and continue to provide, significant technical assistance in the areas of&#13;
municipal lending, housing finance and small business. BISE is located in Warsaw and has a well&#13;
qualified/well trained staff. Its management team has a clear view of the bank's defined mission, and is&#13;
committed to a policy of cautious growth, including the introduction of new products (such as factoring and&#13;
leasing). From an early stage, the bank has been seriously committed to participation in the MFP and has&#13;
taken organizational steps to prepare for implementation of the project (including approaching potential&#13;
municipal borrowers); this is consistent with the bank's explicit strategy of strengthening its presence in&#13;
Poland's municipal credit market.&#13;
35.    Net income (after all expenses except income taxes) more than trebled in 1995 and increased by a&#13;
further 10 percent in 1996. However, the return to equity remains low, at 1.4 percent in both 1995 in 1996,&#13;
in part reflecting its over-capitalized condition. "Irregular" loans have declined from 15.4 percent of the&#13;
portfolio in 1994 to about 8 percent in 1996, a substantial improvement but still relatively high given the&#13;
business nature of much of its portfolio. BISE's business strategy is characterized by greater commercial&#13;
orientation and, supported by its strong capital base, faster balance sheet growth in the future. Most of the&#13;
loan portfolio is on a floating rate basis so, despite an asset-liability maturity mismatch (as in the case of&#13;
PBK), interest rate risk is minimized. The bank has a balanced net foreign exchange position. A more&#13;
detailed description of the bank and review of its activities is provided in Annex 6.&#13;
36.    Eligible final borrowers will be creditworthy municipalities or enterprises operating municipal&#13;
services (either municipally owned enterprises or private firms operating municipal services in eligible&#13;
sectors under concessions awarded by local governments). Eligible sectors will be water, wastewater, solid&#13;
waste and urban transport (including street lighting and road improvement), as well as infrastructure for&#13;
education. Additional sectors may be added during implementation, in agreement with the Bank. Eligible&#13;
investments will include rehabilitation, replacement, improvement or expansion of service assets in eligible&#13;
sectors, supported by adequate studies documenting their financial, economic, environmental and technical&#13;
feasibility, with cost recovery and loan service based either on direct user charges (utilities and local&#13;
transport) or general municipal revenues (for services that are financed from local taxes, such as urban&#13;
traffic management) (see also Annex 2a, Box 2).&#13;
37.    Initial batch of projects. A first batch of sub-projects, identified jointly by the Bank and/or MDA,&#13;
includes the following: Sulejowek, Limanowa, Radom, Dabrowa-Gornicza (wastewater), Pulawy (solid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
waste), and Krakow (urban transport).  The total loan size of these projects (at different stages of&#13;
preparation) is expected to be in the region of US$30 million. Even allowing for a 50 percent slippage or&#13;
droppage, this pipeline should be sufficient to ensure satisfactorv commitments and disbursements during&#13;
the first year of the project. Efforts by both the borrowing banks and the MDA are continuing to ensure the&#13;
development of a healthy pipeline.&#13;
38.    Project-related technical assistance. The project-related technical assistance is divided into two&#13;
separate elements, feasibility studies and institutional development, both of which are financed primarily&#13;
through grant resources provided by a variety of donors (e.g., principally EU-Phare, but also USAID), and&#13;
which is being administered by the MDA. The MDA, in consultation with the respective municipalities or&#13;
municipal enterprises, could assist in preparing TORs for feasibility studies of future investments.2  In&#13;
addition, a PHRD grant is being used primarily to complement institutional development assistance. This&#13;
focuses on two areas of support: (a) the institutional development and strengthening of the MDA, including&#13;
the carrying out of a collateral study; and (b) preparation of projects and financing requests for participating&#13;
municipalities (e.g., budgetary accounting, financial planning and project evaluation skills). In addition,&#13;
borrowing banks could request support from MDA to develop their skills in municipal finance (e.g., project&#13;
appraisal, collateral arrangements). MDA's continued involvement as a provider of project-related technical&#13;
assistance to municipalities is important and could contribute to the achievement of the project's objectives&#13;
but has not been incorporated as a project component for a number of reasons discussed in para 49.&#13;
E.     Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
39.    The total cost is estimated at about US$40 million equixalent, with an estimated 10 percent local&#13;
tax content. This is considered to be a reasonable size for a pilot operation of this type. Given the&#13;
programmatic nature of the project, price and physical contingencies do not apply; they will be embedded in&#13;
the individual sub-loans.&#13;
40.    Table I shows the financing plan. The proposed Bank loans totalling US$22 million equivalent&#13;
could finance up to 75 percent of individual sub-projects. This share may vary (depending on the&#13;
availability of funds from other sources) and is expected to finance about 55 percent of total project costs&#13;
overall. Funds for sub-projects will come from: (a) cash contributions by beneficiary gminy, utilities or user&#13;
associations (at least 20 percent); (b) proceeds of the Bank loan channeled by the borrowing banks; as well&#13;
as (c) possible matching grants or concessional loans from the NFOS for environmental projects; and/or (d)&#13;
financing by commercial banks from their own sources (either by the borrowing bank itself, or through&#13;
syndication arrangements).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
41.    Cooperation with NFOS. For sub-projects that have environmental benefits, NFOS may provide&#13;
matching soft loans, in accordance with NFOS' lending guidelines, and as mentioned in the letter of&#13;
cooperation that it has signed with the Bank for this project.3 This will help municipal borrowers identify&#13;
upfront potential financing from both NFOS and commercial sources. NFOS will thus supplement, rather&#13;
than substitute for, commercial lending, de facto leveraging its scarce financial resources to achieve national&#13;
environmental objectives. NFOS will apply its own environmental criteria including approval from the&#13;
voivodship environmental authorities for sub-projects to be eligible for its soft-loan financing program.&#13;
F.     On-lending Terms&#13;
42.    The borrowing commercial banks (BBs) will on-lend the proceeds of the IBRD loans to local&#13;
government sub-borrowers. The cost to the banks of IBRD loans will be composed of: the IBRD interest&#13;
rate and commitment fees; and the sovereign guarantee fee collected by the Ministry of Finance (a one-time&#13;
payment of 2 percent of the principal amount of the loan). Borrowing banks will on-lend the funds to&#13;
eligible final borrowers (gminy or local utilities) for viable infrastructure projects. The banks will be&#13;
required to lend long-term, with maturities ranging from 5-15 years, including a grace period of up to 3&#13;
years, depending on the type of investment financed. The banks will not be required however to offer&#13;
maturities that are strictly "back-to-back" with the IBRD loans, as this might not match in all cases the&#13;
specific financing needs of the final borrower. These long-termn subloans to final beneficiaries will be made&#13;
either in: (a) foreign currency at a rate reflecting the above costs, plus a spread to cover the commercial&#13;
bank's administrative costs and risk premium; or (b) in local currency on the same terms as (a) but also&#13;
reflecting the foreign exchange risk premium. These onlending terms were agreed with the BBs during&#13;
negotiations and will be reflected in the lending agreements between them and the final beneficiaries.&#13;
43.    The BB's spread negotiated with each final borrower will depend on the borrower's risk profile and&#13;
collateral, on the bank's administrative and fee costs and, for zloty sub-loans, on the exchange rate premium&#13;
applied by the bank.4 To obtain the most competitive spread, municipal borrowers may wish to submit the&#13;
same loan application to both borrowing banks. The commercial banks have indicated that, depending on&#13;
the above factors, they are likely to apply spreads ranging from 1.5 to 4 percentage points on foreign&#13;
currency sub-loans.&#13;
44.    Risk allocation. The Government will be exposed to the risk of commercial bank failure. The&#13;
borrowing banks have therefore been required to meet strict qualification criteria. The credit risk of the&#13;
municipal borrowers will stay with the borrowing banks. These banks will remain liable to service the loan&#13;
regardless of their own performance in collecting the municipal sub-loans. To mitigate the municipal risk,&#13;
the banks will seek collateral arrangements and will carry out a financial appraisal of the sub-borrower.&#13;
45.    Collateral arrangements.  Loans to final borrowers are expected to include a variety of loan&#13;
existing security arrangements including: revenue-based collateral property (commercial property); banking&#13;
3   The letter of cooperation with NFOS, dated March 11, 1996, indicating the scope of cooperation with the&#13;
MFP and NFOS eligibility guidelines for projects will be included among the selected documents in the project file&#13;
(Annex 7).&#13;
4   The overall financing costs for each sub-project will depend on: (a) how much is financed from the&#13;
borrower's equity; (b) whether it qualifies for grant or other concessional financing, e.g., from NFOS; and (c)&#13;
whether the financing package offered by the bank includes only proceeds of the IBRD funding or also financing&#13;
(likely with shorter maturities) by the bank itself, or by other banks, from their own resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
and financial instrument collateral (cession of debtor bank accounts, blocking of bank accounts). Work by a&#13;
legal task force to examine other options, including an escrow on local tax revenues and/or pledge of the&#13;
income stream of municipal enterprises, intercept of the general subsidy to gminy, is being financed with&#13;
resources from a Japanese PHRD grant and is expected to be concluded by July 1997.5&#13;
G.    Participation&#13;
46.    Participation of local communities in the various sub-projects is ensured as individual investments&#13;
are proposed by local government bodies who are elected representatives of the people who will be most&#13;
directly impacted. Furthermore, sub-projects will require City Council approval which provides for public&#13;
fora to discuss municipal investment plans. The ability of a municipality to borrow long-term funds under&#13;
the MFP will require (based on the Local Self Government Act of 1990) an express authorization from the&#13;
local City Council; Mayors and the Executive Boards can exercise discretion only for short- and medium-&#13;
term borrowing levels (subject to agreed ceilings). Evidence that this approval has been obtained is&#13;
incorporated in the appraisal criteria for sub-projects.&#13;
H.    Financial Analysis&#13;
47.    Two project features are aimed at enhancing the financial "integrity" of the project:&#13;
*      At the sub-project level, bank's own credit analysis and sub-project appraisal criteria,&#13;
including a 1.5 debt service coverage ratio.  In those sectors where cost recovery&#13;
mechanisms are feasible (water, wastewater, solid waste and urban transport), recovery of&#13;
operation and maintenance costs and of debt service, at a level appropriate for the specific&#13;
sector, are required.&#13;
-      Banks absorb the municipal credit risk (i.e., commercial spreads and collateral&#13;
arrangements cover for that risk); the risk to the budget, in turn, is minimized by the&#13;
application of strict eligibility criteria for banks.&#13;
L.     Economic Analysis&#13;
48.    Public/private sector issues. The project focuses on investments in the local infrastructure sector&#13;
for which little private sector interest has been demonstrated so far, beyond operational contracts which do&#13;
not include investment finance. Lending to private concessionaires or joint ventures is possible under the&#13;
project, assuming the municipalities are ready to promote such schemes (including the regulatory&#13;
framework). The creation of autonomous water utilities in cities of more than 50,000 inhabitants, one of the&#13;
appraisal criteria of the project, is a first step for the cities to increase private sector participation in the&#13;
future. Even if there is no private sector participation in concessions as such, the facilitation of municipal&#13;
investment plans by the MFP will create increasing opportunities for the private sector to participate in the&#13;
construction, or in management contracts, of new municipal investment projects.&#13;
49.    Project Design Alternatives. Several alternative project designs were considered, including the&#13;
establishment of a Municipal Credit Agency. The creation of such a specialized financial institution would,&#13;
however, have been costly (due to staffing and capitalization), time-consuming (due to training needs and&#13;
5   A preliminary review of the possible use of the different security instrunents and the output of this report&#13;
will be included in the project file (Annex 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
development of regulatory/supervisory framework), and counter to the objective of stimulating a&#13;
competitive market for municipal finance. It would also have presented risks of politicized or unsustainable&#13;
lending as shown by Bank experience with similar agencies in other countries. As designed, the project&#13;
minimizes fiscal costs and potential liabilities for the national budget through the involvement of the&#13;
existing commercial banks, which will assume the full credit risk of the municipal borrowers, and through&#13;
MDA's access to external grant resources to fund technical assistance needed in the project. The main&#13;
technical assistance grant donors (EU Phare and USAID) support the final project design. Incorporating&#13;
technical assistance as a project component by giving the MDA a more central role would have implied&#13;
both an additional fiscal cost and monitoring effort for the Government. Furthermore, the Government was&#13;
not willing to borrow for technical assistance and the banks were unwilling to pay a technical assistance fee&#13;
to the MDA. The borrowing banks also feared that they would be penalized, by delays in both processing&#13;
and implementation of the project and through additional commitment fees, if MDA did not performn&#13;
satisfactorily. Taking these factors into account, the design of this pilot project has been kept simple and an&#13;
attempt made to minimize the above risks. While a more formal involvement of MDA could help the&#13;
project achieve its objectives (and could be even more important if there were to be a follow up operation),&#13;
this is not essential, particularly since a sufficient number of potential sub-projects have been identified and&#13;
the project can be effectively implemented under the proposed arrangements.&#13;
50.    Fiscal impact. At the local level, most of the sub-projects6 will be in revenue-earning utilities and&#13;
will have cost-recovery features which will make them self-financing, thus, having no net budgetary impact&#13;
over the medium and long term. Over the short term, larger gminalutility deficits will reflect new financing&#13;
opportunities, not reductions in saving. At the central level, budgetary savings may result from reduced&#13;
pressure from local governments to obtain grants/subsidies from the central government (as better access to&#13;
financial resources would provide a financing option virtually non-existent now). There is a contingent&#13;
fiscal impact if excessive borrowing by municipalities leads to episodes of default and, in response, the&#13;
central government ends up bailing out banks/municipal borrowers. The project is designed to minimize&#13;
this risk. The application of prudent technical and financial qualification criteria of the project and banks'&#13;
own financial criteria aim at avoiding these situations. In addition, the risk of default resulting from&#13;
uncontrolled municipal borrowing is addressed by existing Polish legislation which limits the ratio of&#13;
unsecured debt service to 15 percent of revenues.&#13;
51.    Benefits and costs. Benefits will accrue from: (a) strengthening of municipal management and&#13;
finances including improved access to financial markets; (b) diversification of commercial banks activities&#13;
into municipal lending through the lengthening of liability maturity, credit enhancement (collateral&#13;
arrangements), municipal lending with their own resources, and acquisition of knowledge in the area of&#13;
project appraisal; (c) improving of urban efficiency (e.g., reduced time of travel) and living standards (e.g.,&#13;
reduced health problems resulting from better quality water) in beneficiary cities; and, (d) a more rational&#13;
allocation of municipal resources resulting from improved project selection and appraisal criteria. Since the&#13;
project pursues high rates of cost-recovery in most of the sub-projects, most of the costs are expected to be&#13;
paid by the final beneficiaries of the municipal services. In general, improved service is expected to&#13;
facilitate willingness to pay (higher tariffs, when there is cost recovery, taxes otherwise).&#13;
52.    Economic analysis of sub-projects.  All investments will be supported by appropriate feasibility&#13;
studies, of a depth that is in line with the sub-project's size and complexity. These studies will demonstrate&#13;
6   Other investments, such as those to improve traffic management and drainage, would be covered through&#13;
general municipal revenues rather than user charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
that each sub-project meets a prudently assessed demand in a least-cost way, and is economically viable&#13;
(appraisal criteria are described in Annex 2a, Box 2).&#13;
53.    Environmental benefits and costs of a typical sub-project. Environmental benefits quantified in&#13;
terms of improved quality of both surface and ground water resources, air quality, protection of natural&#13;
amenity, and improved management of the environmental resources will occur from: (a) wastewater and&#13;
effluent treatment; (b) improved resources utilization through metering and adjusted tariffs; (c) improved&#13;
collection and utilization of municipal solid waste; (d) improved efficiency of urban transport systems.&#13;
Environmental costs, namely costs of environmental pollution control, will be recovered through tariffs,&#13;
user charges and prices of goods paid by the users. Investment costs of addressing negative environmental&#13;
externalities might be, in part, covered by the National Environmental Fund. Environmental benefits of&#13;
investments undertaken by economic entities are generally not perceived by them as financial benefits. But&#13;
since they do represent social and economic benefits, it is in society's interest and well being to support&#13;
interventions by Environmental Funds to the level where costs of mitigation are equal to the value of&#13;
environmental externalities.&#13;
J.     Sources of Risk for the Project&#13;
54.    The main policy-related risks are: (a) further decentralization of public expenditures may be&#13;
inadequately matched by revenue allocations, reducing the ability of gminy to service long-term debt&#13;
obligations and creating risks of default; (b) excessive municipal borrowing could become a problem by&#13;
raising aggregate public sector expenditures and effecting the stabilization program; (c) municipalities may&#13;
be unwilling to borrow at commercial rates, particularly in view of the presence of subsidized funds from&#13;
the environmental funds/bank and other national/regional funds; (d) municipalities may lack the capacity to&#13;
prepare quality projects meeting commercial bank and IBRD criteria, and the incipient MDA may not&#13;
develop sufficient capacity to discharge its facilitation role; and (e) the city may not want to take the foreign&#13;
exchange rate risk.&#13;
55.    The project seeks to alleviate these risks in the following manner: (a) the uncertainty concerning&#13;
future inter-government revenue allocation emphasizes the importance of careful selection of municipalities&#13;
or municipal enterprises, prudent lending criteria, solid collateral arrangements, and focus of the project on&#13;
investments recouped from direct user charges and backed by financially self-reliant utilities; (b) the risk of&#13;
uncontrolled municipal borrowing is addressed by regulations which limit the ratio of unsecured debt&#13;
service to revenues to 15 percent, and the debt carrying capacity of municipalities will be an important&#13;
factor in sub-project selection; (c) with regard to the prospective competition from low-cost funds, the&#13;
cooperation agreement with the NFOS reduces the risk of potential displacement of commercial financing&#13;
of MFP sub-projects by soft loans by identifying up-front the amount of financing that will be available&#13;
through the NFOS and, thus, also the gap for commercial loans; (d) efforts are being made to design&#13;
adequate loan security arrangements and to strengthen local level capacity (one objective of the technical&#13;
assistance to be provided by the MDA); and (e) regarding the foreign exchange rate risk, the banks are&#13;
expected to pass this on to the municipal borrowers. The municipal borrower's ability to mitigate this risk&#13;
will depend on its overall debt service carrying capacity, its foreign exchange-earning capacity (or capacity&#13;
to link tariffs to the exchange rate) and other specific arrangements that it may be able to enter into (e.g.,&#13;
creating a liquidity reserve to absorb unexpected changes in the exchange rate and lengthening the&#13;
amortization of the loan if there is an unexpected devaluation). In addition, Poland's sound macroeconomic&#13;
situation does not suggest the presence of severe distortions in its exchange rate (although future volatility&#13;
cannot be ruled out).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
56.    The project aims to mitigate the risk of slow  commitments and disbursements that have&#13;
characterized other lines of credit in Poland in several ways: (a) by considering the cities' commitments to&#13;
borrow as a key condition for sub-project appraisal; (b) by keeping this first demonstration project to scale&#13;
that is a small fraction of current sector investment volumes, and that is tested against effective market&#13;
interest; and (c) by simplifying and streamlining appraisal, procurement and disbursement procedures to&#13;
help reduce transaction costs associated with Bank loans. Furtherrnore, in addition to a first batch of sub-&#13;
projects for which evidence of borrower interest has been established, efforts have been made to expand the&#13;
pipeline by adding sub-projects at different stages of preparation, to allow for an unavoidable slippage and&#13;
droppage factor. Having the banks as direct borrowers and having them pay the commitment fees to the&#13;
World Bank will increase incentives for mobilizing the line of credit faster, plus the fact that supplemental&#13;
financing from the NFOS will help make the total financial package more attractive to the municipal&#13;
borrowers. In addition, if commitments by one of the banks is slower than anticipated, the Bank and the&#13;
Borrowers have agreed to consider the possibility of onlending the uncommitted funds to the other bank, or&#13;
to a third bank that meets the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the project.&#13;
57.    The risk that banks may be interested in long-term financing of the sub-projects with their own&#13;
resources, rather than with the long-term funds provided under the MFP, is considered moderate, and is&#13;
diminished by providing for their participation in sub-project financing. Interested banks are aware of the&#13;
risks (and possible future regulatory costs) of long-term financing with short-term liabilities (typically at&#13;
floating rates); this exposes excessively the final borrower (and indirectly the banks) to fluctuations in&#13;
liquidity through high interest rate volatility. The proposed loan provides the banks with an important&#13;
source of long-term financing and the SCL instrument offered under this project constitutes for them a&#13;
competitive source of funding at the margin (e.g., compared to what the banks will be able to obtain in&#13;
foreign capital markets). At present, there is a rapidly evolving competition for medium-term financing of&#13;
municipal projects (up to 5 years); the finance instruments most likely to be used in this segment of the&#13;
market are floating-rate loans (from banks with substantial liquidity and/or with large retail networks) and&#13;
municipal bonds (for the larger projects/cities).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CHAPTER III: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
58.    The borrowing banks (BBs) will be both the borrowers and the executing agencies of the proposed&#13;
loans. The Ministry of Finance (MoF), as the representative of the Republic of Poland, will be the&#13;
guarantor. The Municipal Development Agency (MDA) will be involved in development of the project&#13;
pipeline. These responsibilities are summarized below and described in more detail in Annex 2a.&#13;
59.    A single currency IBRD loan will be made to each of the borrowing banks, which will use the funds&#13;
for issuing long-term subloans in foreign exchange or domestic currency at market rates to local&#13;
governments or municipal utilities for viable infrastructure sub-projects. The BBs will be responsible for&#13;
assessing and bearing the credit risk of the borrowing entity, bearing the foreign exchange risk for local&#13;
currency loans and for managing all aspects of the subloans to final borrowers. The gminy or local utilities&#13;
will be responsible for implementing the approved sub-projects. The MDA will channel project-related,&#13;
grant-financed technical assistance to local governments, municipal utilities and borrowing banks. MDA&#13;
will screen applications from local governments and municipal utilities to select beneficiaries for grant-&#13;
financing of feasibility studies.&#13;
B.    Contractual Arrangements&#13;
60.    The above responsibilities will be formalized in a series of legal arrangements, as summarized in&#13;
the following table.&#13;
Table 2 - Contractual Arrangements&#13;
Parties to Agreement             Type of Agreement&#13;
With the Bank            Bank and MoF (Guarantor)          Guarantee Agreement for each Loan&#13;
Bank and each BB                 Loan Agreement&#13;
With the BBs             BB and Municipality/Utility, for each   Subloan Agreement&#13;
subloan&#13;
C.    Implementation Arrangements&#13;
61.   Project administration. Implementation arrangements, described in more detail in Annex 2a,&#13;
were discussed with the BBs during appraisal and confirmed during negotiations. Each BB will be&#13;
responsible for all tasks relating to the implementation and administration of the project and associated&#13;
loan. Each BB has appointed a project coordinator who will have overall responsibility for project&#13;
implementation in the BB.  Specific staff within the BB will be responsible for verifying that&#13;
procurement under subloans is carried out in accordance with the agreed procedures and for handling the&#13;
administration of subloans, including: (a) sub-project appraisal and financial management of subloans;&#13;
(b) preparation of documentation for withdrawals from the Bank loan; (c) supervision of sub-projects; (d)&#13;
sub-project information management (such as seeking approvals from the World Bank for financing&#13;
from the loan, providing implementation status reports, and sub-project auditing); and (e) liaison with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
World Bank. The Bank will organize seminars, including a project launch workshop, to train the&#13;
relevant staff in procurement and disbursement procedures.&#13;
62.    Pipeline Development.  The Bank and/or MDA has prescreened an initial batch of 6 sub-&#13;
projects, for which BB financing is now being sought. Future sub-projects will initially be screened by&#13;
MDA (if its technical assistance for feasibility studies is required) or will be directly assessed by the&#13;
BBs, in accordance with the criteria, described in Annex 2a. For those sub-projects entering the pipeline&#13;
througih MDA, MDA will also make a short pre-feasibility assessment of those projects to enable it to&#13;
allocate the limited grant resources available for feasibility studies to the most promising sub-projects.&#13;
63.    MDA will, as mentioned earlier (para. 38) be responsible for building up a project pipeline,&#13;
supporting both participating municipalities and banks. It has on staff three technical experts, a financial&#13;
specialist and a lawyer to fulfill these functions and will be strengthened with support from project&#13;
management/institutional development consultants, which MDA is in the process of appointing. The&#13;
consultant/s will assist MDA staff and municipalities in preparing bank loan applications and in&#13;
preparing terms of reference for feasibility studies, as well as in training MDA in pre-feasibility study&#13;
project evaluation. These experts will be financed from the ongoing PHRD Grant.&#13;
64.    Sub-project Appraisal.  In preparation for sub-project appraisal, the cities/utilities (with&#13;
assistance from the MDA if appropriate) will ensure that the TORs for the feasibility studies are&#13;
consistent with sub-project appraisal criteria, which are described in Annex 2a (Box 2) and have been&#13;
agreed with the BBs. All sub-projects will be appraised by the BBs. The appraisal of any sub-project&#13;
below US$2.5 million will be carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the concerned borrowing&#13;
bank. This appraisal will be based on a feasibility study of a scope commensurate with the complexity&#13;
and size of the sub-project under consideration, giving appropriate attention to technical, financial,&#13;
institutional and environmental considerations. The first subloan from each BB and all subloans of&#13;
US$2.5 million or more will require the prior review by the Bank. Subloans below US$2.5 million,&#13;
except the first subloan from each BB, will be reviewed expost.&#13;
65.    Onlending Arrangements. Each BB will:&#13;
*      be responsible for all financial aspects of sub-project implementation, including:&#13;
completing its own appraisal to assess the credit/commercial risk and financial viability&#13;
of sub-projects, in accordance with agreed criteria, including, for revenue-earning&#13;
investments, cost recovery of O&amp;M and debt service at a level appropriate for the&#13;
specific sector;&#13;
*      ensure that its municipal borrowers carry out the investments and use the funds for the&#13;
purpose provided;&#13;
*      ensure that environmental and legal (including planning and construction permit)&#13;
requirements have been met;&#13;
*      verify that procurement of inputs and maintenance of project records are in accordance&#13;
with IBRD guidelines;&#13;
*      ensure that its project records and financial statements are audited at the end of each&#13;
fiscal year in accordance with international standards and provide copies of the audit&#13;
reports to the Bank;&#13;
e      make adequate arrangements to meet the World Bank administrative requirements&#13;
(procurement, disbursements, accounting and reporting).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
66.    Implementation of the investment sub-projects will be the responsibility of the beneficiary cities&#13;
(gminy or local utility enterprise). The subloan agreements between the BBs and the final borrower, as&#13;
well as detailing the financial terms and conditions, will require that the final borrower: carries out&#13;
procurement in accordance with procurement procedures agreed between the Bank and the BB;&#13;
disburses funds to contractors and suppliers; provides counterpart funding and mobilizes domestic&#13;
financing where applicable; keeps accounts/records of sub-project expenditures; has these records&#13;
audited in accordance with Polish law; and reports to the BB on sub-project progress.&#13;
D.    Environmental Aspects&#13;
67.    The project has been rated "B" for the purpose of OD 4.01. Line of credit operations through&#13;
financial intermediaries require that each sub-project financed with these resources comply with national&#13;
environmental standards and regulations, supported by an appropriate institutional framework. In the&#13;
case of Poland, this framework is in place. In accordance with existing regulations, an Environmental&#13;
Impact Analysis (EIA) must be carried out for green field operations. Where necessary, this analysis will&#13;
also be completed as part of feasibility studies, financed from grant resources managed by the MDA.&#13;
68.    Investments including financing from the NFOS will be thoroughly screened by the Fund.' In&#13;
addition, verification that sub-projects comply with environmental regulations will be the responsibility&#13;
of the BB, which will have to check that sub-projects submitted for its approval comply with all Polish&#13;
legal requirements, including environmental ones.  The final beneficiary will have to submit the&#13;
appropriate environmental permit before subloan approval. In all cases, the BBs will ensure in their&#13;
subloan agreements that the final borrowers are in compliance with Polish environmental regulations and&#13;
agree to rehabilitate/build/operate the planned sub-projects according to these regulations. Commercial&#13;
banks need to develop procedures to screen projects and to manage them for environmental risk as well&#13;
as environmental liability. The BB's compliance with these responsibilities will be reviewed by the Bank&#13;
during project supervision.&#13;
E.    Procurement Arrangements&#13;
69.    The loans will finance sub-projects for municipalities or municipal enterprises for the&#13;
modernization, rehabilitation, construction or improvement of municipal infrastructure. To the extent&#13;
possible, it is expected that subloans will finance supply and installation contracts. If certain items cannot&#13;
be incorporated in such a contract, they will be procured separately, but efforts will be made to keep to such&#13;
procurement to a minimum. All project components financed from the proposed Bank loans will be&#13;
procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (August 1996), including the&#13;
application of the Polish Public Procurement Law (PPL), as explained below. Given the nature of this&#13;
project, involving support to sub-projects, most of which have not been preappraised, detailed estimates for&#13;
the breakdown of the project expenditures by procurement method are not available. Details of the&#13;
procurement arrangements, including thresholds for the various methods and review requirements, are&#13;
included in the Project Implementation Plan (Annex 2a).&#13;
7   Details of the selection and evaluation criteria used by NFOS have been reviewed by the Bank and are&#13;
considered to be satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
70.    Procurement for each municipal investment sub-project will be carried out by the individual&#13;
beneficiary local government or municipal utility responsible for its implementation, under procurement&#13;
methods and procedures reviewed by and satisfactory to the Bank, including procurement through NCB,&#13;
where applicable. A Country Procurement Assessment for Poland was undertaken in May-June 1995,&#13;
during which time the PPL, approved in June 1994, was reviewed in detail. As a result of the discussion of&#13;
this assessment with the Government, it has been agreed, for contracts for works, and for supply and&#13;
installation contracts, estimated to cost less than US$5 million per package, that the unlimited tendering&#13;
procedure, as provided for in the PPL,' is acceptable to the Bank subject to certain conditions (Annex 2a).&#13;
This procedure is to be used in place of the National Competitive Bidding procedure described in the&#13;
Procurement Guidelines. Similarly, it has been agreed that the procurement method called "request for&#13;
proposals" in the PPL will be used in place of: (a) International Shopping for contracts for equipment and&#13;
materials estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$400,000 per package, based on a comparison of&#13;
price quotations from at least three suppliers in two different countries; and (b) National Shopping for&#13;
equipment and materials estimated to cost up to US$100,000 per package, and for small works of up to&#13;
US$300,000 per package.&#13;
F.    Disbursements and Special Account&#13;
71.    The loan will finance up to 100 percent of the amounts disbursed by borrowing banks to&#13;
municipal borrowers for eligible subloans. These disbursements are expected to cover: (a) up to 75&#13;
percent of the total cost of any sub-project financed; and (b) eligible expenditures, i.e., contracts for&#13;
works, equipment and services procured in accordance with arrangements agreed with the Bank.&#13;
Disbursements for subloans of less than US$2.5 million equivalent will be on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditures. To facilitate disbursements, each BB will establish a Special Account with a qualified&#13;
commercial bank.&#13;
72.    The detailed disbursement schedule is provided in Annex 4 and is summarized below (Table 3).&#13;
It is anticipated that total loan proceeds will be committed against subloans within 3 years of loan&#13;
effectiveness and that disbursements will be spread over 4.5 years. Based on this schedule, the expected&#13;
completion date for the project is June 30, 2001 and the Closing Date is December 31, 2001.&#13;

G.    Reporting and Audits&#13;
73.    The project account, Special Account and Statements of Expenditure will be maintained by each&#13;
BB and will be audited at the end of each fiscal year in accordance with international standards, as part&#13;
of the annual audit of the BB. Assurance were obtained during negotiations that each borrower will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
appoint independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that it will present to the Bank, within six&#13;
months after the end of each fiscal year, audited financial statements. The financial statements of the&#13;
final beneficiaries will be audited in accordance with Polish law. The audit reports for the final&#13;
beneficiaries will be retained by the respective borrowing banks and made available to the Bank on&#13;
request.&#13;
74.    The borrowing banks will maintain financial records of the project and provide periodic progress&#13;
reports to the Bank on the status of sub-project financing. These reports will also comment on project&#13;
execution achievements and compare them with the key performance indicators listed in Annex 2b. The&#13;
format for these reports was confirmed during negotiations. Assurances were also obtained that each BB&#13;
will be responsible for preparing an implementation completion report and will submit this to the Bank&#13;
within six months after the closing date of the loan.&#13;
H.    Project Supervision&#13;
75.   It is anticipated that supervision of this project will require an above average effort, with a&#13;
heavier concentration in the first two years of implementation and at least three supervision missions&#13;
annually, because ofthe support required to appraise sub-projects. By end-1999, the BBs and the Bank&#13;
will jointly undertake a mid-term review of implementation progress and compliance with loan. In years&#13;
I and 2 of implementation, 18 staffweeks per fiscal year are anticipated, divided amongst the Task&#13;
Manager, a municipal finance specialist, a banking expert and technical specialists (using local experts to&#13;
the extent possible) in the various sectors. In addition, limited support (totaling less than 1 week/year)&#13;
from procurement and institutional development experts is envisaged. In later years the supervision&#13;
effort should be reduced to 12-15 staffweeks per year. Ongoing support for day-to-day activities is&#13;
anticipated from the Resident Mission (about 6 staffweeks) and is expected to increase over time as it&#13;
will assume the responsibility for sub-project review as its staff develops experience in this area.&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
Page I of 9&#13;
MUNICIPAL FINANCE AND INVESTMENT IN POLAND&#13;
A.    Decentralization of Public Infrastructure and Services&#13;
1.     Under the Local Self-Government Act (LSGA) of 1990, Poland transferred to over 2,400&#13;
municipalities (gminy) the provision of a broad range of local infrastructure and services including water&#13;
and sanitation, drainage, land development, urban streets, mass transit, and district heating. Further&#13;
decentralization reforms are underway or being considered, such as the creation of a second tier of local&#13;
government (powiats), and the devolution of new functions in the social sectors. Given their new&#13;
ownership of public service assets, local governments have assumed the responsibility to mobilize resources&#13;
for operation, maintenance and expansion of these services. Decentralization is seen as a means to deepen&#13;
democratic processes at the local level, and bring the control of local services closer to the beneficiaries.&#13;
2.     By and large, Polish gminy have, within their means, risen to the challenge of their expanded role&#13;
under the LSGA and have taken charge for the services devolved. A number of large and medium-sized&#13;
cities have engaged in the restructuring of their municipal enterprises; this process can comprise the&#13;
creation of limited liability companies, joint-stock companies, sale to employees, full privatization or&#13;
liquidation. Six years into decentralization, enterprise restructuring has not been completed everywhere. In&#13;
some small and medium-sized cities, municipal enterprises have been re-consolidated into one municipal&#13;
company, partly to avoid payment of the corporate income tax and to reserve funds for investment. This&#13;
practice can lead to prolonging inefficient structures and cross-subsidizing services. Most cities have&#13;
adopted responsible service pricing policies that required politically painful increases in user charges.&#13;
Many gminy have also started work on strengthening their management and revenue administration&#13;
systems, and defining investment priorities responsive to the needs of their constituents. In addition, gminy&#13;
budgets generate sizeable current savings and account for a large part of total public investment.&#13;
3.     Decentralization of tasks (and the associated financing) to local authorities accelerated between&#13;
1994-96, with some of these tasks requiring important operating funds from municipal budgets. Effective&#13;
1995, gminy became responsible for the allocation of housing subsidies to low income households. Gminy&#13;
are now authorized to raise rents on municipal housing units, within a fixed ceiling (which varies by&#13;
voivodship), but housing allocations must be paid to low-income inhabitants of cooperative as well as&#13;
municipal housing. This new charge has been estimated at up to 10 percent of municipal budgets, and&#13;
depends on the mix of municipal and cooperative housing in each gmina. Primary education was finally&#13;
transferred to all municipalities in 1996 (up to the end of 1995, 700 gminy had accepted this responsibility).&#13;
Also in 1996, the "Big City Law" replaced the powiat pilot program which had been established in 1994.&#13;
Under this law, voivodship and national tasks, including secondary and vocational education, art schools,&#13;
social care and assistance centers, health care establishments, culture and art institutions, road maintenance&#13;
and protection, were transferred to 46 specific cities, as well as to the local authorities of Warsaw.&#13;
4.     The recent and continuing transfer of these partially unfunded mandates in education, housing&#13;
allocations and powiat tasks (for the largest cities) is placing increased stress on municipal budgets. This&#13;
evolution may limit municipal financial capacity for investments; indeed, investment expenditures&#13;
increased much less rapidly between 1994-96, compared to previous years. The level of investment may&#13;
taper off in the next 2-3 years, despite continued major backlogs of deferred maintenance and replacement&#13;
(such as urban transport) and the need to bring existing equipment in line with stricter environmental&#13;
standards (sewage treatment facilities, solid waste landfills). Such an evolution only highlights the need for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
(sewage treatment facilities, solid waste landfills). Such an evolution only highlights the need for municipal&#13;
access to long-term capital, enabling municipalities to meet investment needs and to leverage their&#13;
municipal budget capacity through debt financing.&#13;
B.    Municipal Investment Trends&#13;
5.     Aggregate gmina investment reached PLN 5.6 billion in 1996, representing about 1.5 percent of&#13;
Poland's GDP. The ratio of municipal to total government capital expenditures at 55 percent (1996) is&#13;
relatively high by middle-income country standards, but this reflects mainly the low overall level of public&#13;
investment in recent years. Given its wide sectoral scope which includes capital-intcnsivc services,&#13;
Poland's municipal sector needs to invest more--between 2-3 percent of GDP--with water and wastewater&#13;
alone accounting for about half.&#13;
6.     The coverage of local infrastructure in Poland is satisfactory by middle-income country&#13;
comparisons. That is, water supply or garbage collection, for instance, have near universal coverage in&#13;
urban areas, and there are no widespread service disruptions. The street networks and transit services are&#13;
highly developed. Nevertheless, the infrastructure equipment and networks on which these services depend&#13;
are inadequate and there is need for considerable investment to address efficiency and environmental issues.&#13;
Specifically, investments are needed to: (a) clear a backlog of deferred maintenance and overdue asset&#13;
renewal which has built up from the 1980's--the pace of pipe replacement in water or heat networks, and&#13;
the renewal rates of bus fleets have been unsustainably low; (b) address a legacy of past environmental&#13;
neglect--only one-third of urban sewage undergoes secondary treatment, and many solid waste disposal&#13;
facilities are unsound; (c) undertake optimization investment, especially to conserve energy and water in&#13;
utilities' networks--the design standards and technologies used in the past paid little attention to resource&#13;
use; (d) in the urban transport sector, engineering and investment in public transit modes arc needed to&#13;
mitigate congestion and environmental risks associated with the fast growth of car ownership and increased&#13;
traffic; and (e) develop housing-related infrastructure--the limited availability of serviced land for new&#13;
housing in some fast-growing urban areas constrains the ability of labor to move and seek new employment&#13;
opportunities in a restructuring economy. Compliance with EU Environmental Standards will further&#13;
increase investment needs.&#13;
7.     The recent sectoral distribution of municipal investment is not well documented, as national&#13;
statistics aggregate many sub-sectors into one big item called "municipal economy". Based on a survey of&#13;
a small sample of localities, the main sectors in 1993 were sewage treatment (17 percent), water supply (15&#13;
percent), sewage collection (8 percent), education (14 percent), streets (8 percent), housing (6 percent),&#13;
land development (8 percent), heat supply (5 percent) and urban transit (4 percent). Growth sectors during&#13;
1991-93 included sewage treatment and transport. The share of heat supply, streets and water have&#13;
declined. Solid waste investment has been small but sample gminy expected it to pick up sharply from&#13;
1994. The high share of the environmental services (water and waste) may reflect local priorities, but also&#13;
a greater availability of concessional finance for these sectors (avoidance of polluter charges was an&#13;
additional incentive for investment in sewage treatment). Sample gminy also invested in sectors for which&#13;
they had not been devolved formal responsibility (hospitals, schools, telephone lines), but which they&#13;
perceived to be under-provided by the center.&#13;
8.     By far the main source of funds for local government investment has been their current savings&#13;
(current revenues minus current expenditures). Nationwide, current savings amounted to 81 percent of&#13;
capital expenditures in 1996. Other sources of investment financing include grants from the voivodships,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
central ministries, the national and voivodship environmental protection funds (NFOS and WFOS), mainly&#13;
for wastewater and solid waste investments, national budget grants (mainly for streets, public transport and&#13;
housing), and the Kuratoria (for schools). In 1993, the known total of these grants represented no more&#13;
than 12-15 percent of municipal investments. The NFOS and WFOS also provide soft loans to gminy for&#13;
wastewater and sanitation investments.&#13;
9.     With the major exception of sewage treatment, the relative levels of national budget support (direct&#13;
or through voivodships) to different types of investment in the sample gminy do not suggest sharp sectoral&#13;
priorities. Central funds are thus unlikely to have a substantial effect on the allocation of municipal&#13;
expenditures. This would argue for streamlining some of the capital grant programs channeled through a&#13;
variety of national or regional agencies. If the objective is just to transfer resources across the board, it&#13;
could be achieved more simply by topping up the block grant or tax sharing formula.&#13;
10.   Investment grant funds from the central government and voivodships will remain limited and&#13;
municipal investment capacity may decline in the coming two or three years; thus, municipalities will need&#13;
to seek long-term credit financing for their investment projects. Given that the Polish commercial banking&#13;
sector does not dispose of long-term funds commensurate with the financing of infrastructure equipment,&#13;
the MFP can play a vital role in jump-starting long-term investment finance, with advantages to both gminy&#13;
and the financial sector.&#13;
C.    Municipal Finance&#13;
Trends in local revenues and expenditures&#13;
11.    Municipal revenues' increased by 16.2 percent in 1994, 5.6 percent in 1995 and 24.4 percent in&#13;
1996, net of inflation. The large increases in 1994 and 1996 are due to the implementation of the powiat&#13;
pilot program, which led to sharp increases in government transfers and shares of personal income tax&#13;
contributions.&#13;
12.    Of municipal current revenues, 41 percent originate from "own revenues." This category includes&#13;
fiscal revenue (real estate, agricultural, transportation, business license, market and other taxes and stamp&#13;
duties), income from the sale and lease of municipal property, interest income and transfers of profits from&#13;
municipal enterprises. The major element of own revenues, the real estate tax, remained stable as a share&#13;
of current income, at 12-14 percent, and is highest (16 percent) in gminy with populations of 10-30,000&#13;
(Table 1). Shares of central taxes (personal income tax--PIT; and corporate income tax--CIT) were 23&#13;
percent of current revenues of all Polish gminy in 1994 and 1995, and 26 percent in 1996; income growth&#13;
from the PIT (net of inflation) is higher than overall current revenue growth, while the rate of CIT revenues&#13;
declined in real terms in 1994 and 1996.&#13;
1      This analysis is based on data in the MoF quarterly budget reports for gminy, for the years 1991 to 1995.&#13;
All income for targeted and earmarked transfers are excluded from current revenues. Further information on&#13;
budget data and ratios are included in the note on budget tables/indicators at the end of this annex.&#13;

13.    Current expenditures for all gminy increased from 4.6 percent of GDP in 1993 to 6.8 percent in&#13;
1996, due to the introduction of the powiat program and expansion of voluntary coverage of primary&#13;
education. Investment expenditures increased from 1.2 percent in 1991-92 to 1.5 percent of GDP in 1996.&#13;
Net savings and investment capacity. Role of term finance&#13;
14.    The level of Polish municipal investment effort--22 percent of total expenditures--is quite high,&#13;
compared say, to Hungary (18 percent of expenditures), but gminy may have difficulty in maintaining this&#13;
level of investment effort. Gminy appeared to have consolidated their finances in 1995-96, with most&#13;
population categories registering slight increases of savings and investment capacities. Nevertheless, the&#13;
change in distribution of the PIT and the transfer of primary education expenditures resulting from the&#13;
powiat reform reduced the ratio of municipal savings to investment capacity in 1996 (from 84 percent to 81&#13;
percent, and with lower investment). In order to continue necessary infrastructure investments, gminy will&#13;
require greater recourse to loan financing (this is reportedly beginning).&#13;
D.      Revenue Base and Term Finance&#13;
Predictability of revenue&#13;
15.    Improved access of municipalities to long-term finance will hinge on the predictability of revenues.&#13;
As can be forecast with the knowledge of five years of decentralization and of new tasks which may fall on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

gminy, municipal revenues are generally predictable. That is to say, there has been little contesting of the&#13;
municipal share of central taxes (PIT/CIT) and the recent change in the distribution formula of the PIT has&#13;
been known to gminy for at least three years. The general subsidy, although revised in 1994, has been&#13;
generally stable. Transfers of new tasks in social areas are generally underfunded; those gminy which have&#13;
already taken on education or powiat pilot responsibilities have already made the adjustment in their&#13;
budget, often by lowering the amount of expenditures for investments. Those gminy which have taken&#13;
education only from 1996 are currently adapting to these adjustments. It should also be noted that the level&#13;
of discretionary revenues in municipal budgets has decreased between 1993 and 1995. Targeted transfers&#13;
were 28-30 percent of total revenues for municipalities of less than 50,000 in 1995, compared to 21-22&#13;
percent two years earlier. Due to the powiat pilot program and primary education, earmarked revenues are&#13;
38-40 percent of total revenues (1995) of cities with more than 50,000 residents, compared to 25-27&#13;
percent in 1993.&#13;
Own sources of revenue&#13;
16.    The predictability of revenue will increase with the strengthening of the own sources of revenue;&#13;
despite some recent improvements, Poland still has a long way to go in this direction.&#13;
17.    The discretionary nature of own revenues varies by type of income. Gminy collect the real estate&#13;
tax and the transportation tax, but a tax rate ceiling is in effect nationally. Gminy may choose but are not&#13;
obliged to impose the ceiling rate. Many gminy prefer to vote a lower tax rate, and they often define&#13;
specific exemptions. The agricultural tax, the business license tax and stamp duties are collected by&#13;
Regional Tax Offices and then transferred to gminy. Cminy may determine these tax rates and exemptions,&#13;
but are also limited by a rate ceiling. Sales and leases of municipal commercial property are more&#13;
dependent on market conditions. Although municipal housing stock income covers only a small proportion&#13;
of maintenance and rehabilitation needs, gminy may now increase rent on municipal housing units, within a&#13;
ceiling defined for each voivodship.&#13;
18.    The real estate tax in gminy is currently levied on the basis of property surface (tax per square&#13;
meter). Unless and until an ad-valorem property tax is adopted for Polish gminy, there is little potential for&#13;
growth in collections of this tax, as the value of the tax base will vary only marginally. A study of real&#13;
estate values and transactions in Krakow2 concluded that the introduction of an ad-valorem property tax in&#13;
Poland is feasible, and that revenues from such a tax could provide 35 to 40 percent of municipal budget&#13;
income.&#13;
19.    Unlike the real estate tax, the corporate and personal income taxes are responsive to local economic&#13;
conditions. The municipal share of 5 percent of CIT is transferred to the gmina where the tax is effectively&#13;
levied. The municipal share of 15 percent of PIT is distributed to municipalities within each voivodship, on&#13;
a per capita basis. This distribution system favors smaller rural gminy, which generally have fewer&#13;
residents working as salaried employees. The PIT distribution system was modified in 1996, with the tax&#13;
revenues transferred to the gmina where the tax is effectively levied. This change in distribution of the PIT&#13;
would destabilize the finances of small gminy in the initial transitional period, but will bring increased&#13;
revenues to large- and medium-sized cities where the PIT taxpayers effectively reside and demand public&#13;
services. As a result, the change in distribution is being phased in over five years, so that each municipality&#13;

would not lose or gain a certain percentage of PIT (10 percent in 1996, 30 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent&#13;
and 100 percent implementation by 2000).&#13;
E.    Budgeting and Financial Management&#13;
20.   With the transfer of responsibilities, gminy were also required to develop and prepare their own&#13;
budgets and working documents, based on local municipal needs. Financial analytical tools were not&#13;
generally known to personnel of municipalities. In many municipalities, finance departments remained&#13;
unable to influence the preparation of budgets by their budgetary units (jednostke budzetowy), such as for&#13;
schools, creches or social centers. In addition, the budgetary classification system was elaborated by the&#13;
MoF and is more appropriate to state budget rather than to municipal budget needs. This situation often&#13;
requires local governments to develop their own formats, in addition to preparing traditionally presented&#13;
budgets for MoF and GUS statistical requirements.&#13;
21.   Despite these constraints, many local governments have made considerable and noticeable progress&#13;
in budget preparation and presentation since 1991. These improvements often result from exchanges with&#13;
other cities in Europe and the United States through twinning agreements, training or direct assistance in&#13;
budget preparation provided by bilateral donors (USAID, British Know-How Fund) or local training&#13;
providers (Foundation in Support of Local Democracy) and exchanges of experience among municipalities&#13;
themselves. The next stage of budget preparation needs will involve dissemination of financial and&#13;
analytical tools to those cities which have not had exposure to these methods. For example, budget&#13;
seminars organized by USAID and sponsored by the Municipal Development Agency have presented the&#13;
budget experiences of Krakow and Lublin. An issue which as of yet has rarely been the subject of&#13;
training, but for which there is great need, are methods of preparing medium- and long-term municipal&#13;
capital investment plans. Such training is especially needed for gminy to gain awareness of medium and&#13;
long-term financial implications of the investment projects they are undertaking today, such as new or&#13;
additional operating costs, scheduling of debt payments, and the means of financing these new charges.&#13;
Ability to prioritize and plan capital projects will also assist gmina officials in management and evolution&#13;
of their regular budgets.&#13;

NOTES ON THE BUDGET TABLES AND FINANCIAL INDICATORS&#13;
MUNICIPAL BUDGET ELEMENTS&#13;
Current revenues: Includes general and targeted transfers from the central govemment and own revenues.&#13;
General transfers from the central government: These transfers include Shared Taxes [gmina share of the Personal&#13;
Income Tax and the Corporate Income Tax] and the General Subsidy.&#13;
Own revenues: Real Estate Tax, Agricultural Taxes, Transport Tax, Stamp Duties, Business License, Other Revenues&#13;
[market fees, local taxes, inheritance taxes, dog taxes, local fines and penalties, income from rental, lease and sale of&#13;
municipal property, transfers from budgetary units, interest income...].&#13;
Targeted transfers: Revenue provided from the central govemment to finance specific tasks which have been delegated&#13;
or transferred to municipalities. Some transfers must be used for the specific tasks for which they are destined and the&#13;
unused portion retumed to the sectoral Ministry which distributes the funds. Others may be transferred from the Ministry&#13;
of Finance (primary education in 1992-1993 and from 1996), but are used to finance major tasks which have been recently&#13;
declared gmina own tasks. Targeted transfers include: Primary education transfer, Powiat pilot transfer (Big-city transfer&#13;
of PITfrom 1996), Grant for housing allocations, Grants for delegated tasks (social and welfare assistance, administrative&#13;
tasks such as the census, outpatient health care for some cities...); Grants for own tasks (when these grants are determined&#13;
to be for operating rather than investment purposes).&#13;
Capital expenditures: Most investment is listed under §72 to §77 of the budgetary classification. This is the amount listed&#13;
as investment in the Ministry of Finance fourth quarter budget reports. However, expenditures for rehabilitation and&#13;
renovation of municipal assets are budgeted under §36 of Current Expenditures, and may only be obtained in detailed&#13;
budget documents, if the local govemment chooses to indicate these expenditures separately.&#13;
Capital revenues: Grants for own tasks (if they are transfers for municipal own investments), and other capital income&#13;
(often listed off-budget), such as funds from Gmina Environmental Protection Funds (GFOS3), loans and grants from the&#13;
National and Voivodship Environmental Protection Funds (NFOS, WFOS). Banks loans are listed off-budget, in the&#13;
"Financing of shortfall" section.&#13;
To Finance Investment: The difference between capital expenditures and capital revenues, and indicates the amount of&#13;
funds which are needed to finance investment and may be obtained through self-financing (net savings), surplus carried&#13;
over from previous years, borrowing, issuance of securities or other funds.&#13;
Gmina funds for Environmental Protection are financed by tree and underbrush fees (100%), 50% of solid waste disposal fees and&#13;
10% of all other fees and fines levied on the territory of the gmina to which the funds are remanded. Gminy may use these funds for&#13;
environmental projects.&#13;

Financial Independence   (General transfers from Central Government + Own Revenues)/Current Revenues&#13;
This ratio indicates the extent to which municipal revenues are earmarked for transferred and&#13;
delegated tasks. This ratio is naturally lower for powiat cities and gminy which have taken&#13;
over primary education.&#13;
Net Savings             Current Revenues - Current Expenditures&#13;
Savings Capacity        Net Savings / Current Revenues&#13;
This ratio indicates the extent to which municipalities can finance investment from current&#13;
revenues. Due to the classification of municipal budgets (and the structure of the MoF's fourth&#13;
quarter budget reports), this indicator incorporates some capital revenues, such as sales of&#13;
municipal property.&#13;
Debt Burden             Debt Service/Current Revenues&#13;
NOTE: Interest payments are indicated in the budget. Principal repayments are off-budget&#13;
expenditures and are not always indicated in the budget documents. Interest payments may&#13;
not always be indicated separately, but buried in a mass of other expenditures.&#13;
Debt Coverage Ratio     Net Savings/Debt Service&#13;
If this ratio falls below 1.5, a municipality is likely to have difficulty servicing its debt and&#13;
financing capital expenditures. This is one of the main criteria for the choice of MFP loans.&#13;
Investment Effort       Investment Expenditures/Current Revenues&#13;
This ratio includes expenditures for rehabilitation and renovation for those gminy which&#13;
provided this information for 1994 and 1995.&#13;

Budget Balance          Surplus (Deficit)/Current Revenues&#13;
(after Investment Loans)  This ratio adjusts the initial deficit by accounting for long term investment loans and issuance&#13;
of securities (if any); if the deficit is financed by previous year surplus or short-term loans, the&#13;
final result will still be negative.&#13;

POLAND - MUNICIPAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (PIP)&#13;
A.    Introduction&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
I.    The main goal of the MFP is to promote the development of a credit market for municipal&#13;
investment in Poland. To this end, the project pursues the following two inter-related objectives. First,&#13;
provide long-term financial resources to commercial banks for municipal lending in the infrastructure&#13;
sector. Second, help the banks identify and prepare a sustained pipeline of viable investment projects,&#13;
backed by creditworthy towns or local utilities.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
2.     The proposed project, a US$22.0 million equivalent line of credit guaranteed by the Republic of&#13;
Poland, will consist of single-currency loans to two selected commercial banks (Bank for Socio-Economic&#13;
Initiatives SA - BISE - and Powszechny Bank Kredytowy SA w Warszawie - PBK), to be relent to&#13;
municipalities and local utilities. The loan to BISE will be in two tranches: one of US$4 million and one of&#13;
DM 5.2 million. The loan to PBK will be in one tranche of US$8 million and one tranche of DM 12&#13;
million. The project is designed as a pilot operation to demonstrate how term-finance of municipal&#13;
investments at commercial terms can work. All subloans will be long-term, at market rates (to be agreed&#13;
with each borrowing bank--BB) and will finance works, goods and services for eligible municipal&#13;
infrastructure investment sub-projects. Final loans will be a minimum of US$250,000 and, for PBK or a&#13;
consortium of PBK and BISE, a maximum of US$14 million equivalent, to finance up to 75 percent of&#13;
individual sub-project costs. The average cost of a sub-project is, however, expected to be about US$4&#13;
million equivalent. Subloans for any individual sub-project will not exceed US$14 million in the aggregate.&#13;
The project will also promote the channeling of TA resources (through the Municipal Development Agency&#13;
- MDA) to market participants including (i) municipalities, in the areas of project preparation and financial&#13;
management; (ii) banks, for appraising municipal credit and structuring robust loan security arrangements;&#13;
and (iii) the MDA to strengthen its continuing role as a facilitator of municipal investment.&#13;
3.    Borrowing banks. The borrowing banks, PBK and BISE, which are in good standing with NBP,&#13;
have been appraised to ascertain that they meet all the eligibility criteria. A description of these criteria is&#13;
provided in Annex 5; a description of the banks and review of their activities is provided in Annex 6.&#13;
Several other banks were also considered as potential borrowers under the project but were finally excluded&#13;
either because they did not satisfy the criteria--particularly with regard to privatization status--or because&#13;
they were not ready to enter into a borrowing commitment at this time. A number of banks (which are&#13;
likely to meet the above criteria) did, however, express a strong desire to participate in any later operation.&#13;
4.     Eligible final borrowers will be creditworthy municipalities or enterprises operating municipal&#13;
services (either municipally-owned enterprises or private firms operating municipal services in eligible&#13;
sectors under concessions awarded by local governments). Eligible sectors are water, wastewater, solid&#13;
waste, urban transport (including street lighting and road improvement) and infrastructure for education.&#13;
Other sectors may also be included with the prior agreement of the Bank. Eligible investments will include&#13;
rehabilitation, replacement, improvement or expansion of service assets in eligible sectors, supported by&#13;
adequate studies documenting their financial, economic, environmental and technical feasibility, with cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

recovery and loan service based either on direct user charges (utilities) or general municipal revenues (for&#13;
services that are financed from local taxes, such as urban traffic management, streets) (see also Box 2).&#13;
Onlending Arrangements&#13;
5.     The following onlending arrangements will be reflected in the subloan agreements between the BB&#13;
and the final beneficiary. The bank subloans for municipal investments will be made to eligible final&#13;
borrowers for viable infrastructure projects. The subloans will be long-term, for periods ranging from 5-&#13;
15 years depending on the assets financed, and including grace periods of up to 3 years. Subloans will be&#13;
at market rates and could be in foreign currency, or in zloty-denominated loans, in which case the banks&#13;
rather than the final borrower will assume (and charge for) the foreign exchange risk. To lower the overall&#13;
financing cost for a specific investment, the municipality may also wish to seek grants or low cost loans,&#13;
such as from the NFOS, to cover the environmental components of its investments.&#13;
6.     The credit risk of the municipal borrowers will stay with the borrowing banks, who will remain&#13;
liable to service the loan regardless of their own performance in collecting payments for municipal&#13;
subloans. Banks will seek collateral/security from municipal borrowers to protect against this risk.&#13;
B.    Implementation Arrangements and Responsibilities&#13;
Organizational Responsibilities&#13;
7.     The borrowing municipalities/utilities will implement the sub-projects and the BBs will be&#13;
responsible for the overall implementation and administration of the project. MDA will manage and&#13;
channel technical assistance resources and will assist in the selection and preparation of sub-projects. The&#13;
responsibilities of the various entities involved in project implementation were confirmed with the&#13;
borrowers during negotiations and are summarized in the following table (Table 1).&#13;

enter the pipeline either by direct application to the BBs or through the MDA. Efforts are continuing by&#13;
both the banks and the MDA to ensure the buiid-up of a healthy pipeline. In cases where application is&#13;
made directly to a BB, the BB may request assistance from MDA in assessing the eligibility of the&#13;
investment for financing from the MFP or it may carry out its own assessment.&#13;
10.    Sub-project Preparation. Sub-project preparation is the responsibility of the final borrower, it&#13;
may apply to MDA for financial and technical assistance for carrying out feasibility studies. MDA is&#13;
managing grant resources for EU-Phare for this purpose (see Box 1 for an outline of MDA's pre-&#13;
feasibility screening process). To benefit from this assistance, municipal borrowers will have to comply&#13;
with MDA procedures, which could include entering into a technical agreement with MDA. Alternatively,&#13;
some towns who have direct access to technical assistance from other donor resources, or are willing to&#13;
finance the project preparation effort from their own funds, can proceed directly to contracting consultants&#13;
for preparing feasibility studies.&#13;
11.    Generic or outline terns of reference2 (TORs) for feasibility studies for each sector have been&#13;
prepared and will be disseminated to interested cities by the MDA and borrowing banks. These TORs are&#13;
designed to ensure that the feasibility studies, to be carried out by suitably qualified experts, provide&#13;
sufficient information to assess whether appraisal criteria are met. Economic analysis requirements will&#13;
be incorporated as part of the feasibility study.&#13;
Details of MDA's project preparation procedures are provided in the Project File (Annex 7).&#13;

12.    The BBs will appraise all sub-projects they finance. In addition, selected sub-projects from the&#13;
initial batch, and the first subloan from  each BB, will be reviewed by the Bank, prior to approval for&#13;
financing from the loan, to test the criteria and their capacity to carry out the required appraisal, which&#13;
will include checking that appraisal criteria (see Box 2 above) are met. The Bank will subsequently carry&#13;
out such prior reviews only for subloans of US$2.5 million and above. Subloans below US$2.5 million&#13;
will be appraised in accordance with the guidelines of the concerned borrowing bank and will reviewed ex&#13;
post. These subloans will be based on feasibility studies which give appropriate attention to technical,&#13;
financial, institutional and environmental considerations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Approval and Financing of Sub-proiects&#13;
13.   Borrowing Banks. The banks will work with the borrowing municipalities in putting together an&#13;
acceptable financing package for the individual sub-projects. Before or in parallel with the feasibility&#13;
study, the gmina will enter into preliminary contact with one or both BBs to ascertain their potential&#13;
interest in the operation in question.&#13;
14.    The BBs will extend subloans to municipalities in the same single currency (or currencies) as the&#13;
World Bank loan, or in local currency, at commercial rates. For foreign exchange subloans, the BB will&#13;
add its spread, including its premium for the perceived riskiness of the project and the borrower. The&#13;
term will depend on the nature of the investment financed but will be between 5-15 years, including a&#13;
grace period of up to 3 years. For subloans in domestic currency, the BB will also add a premium to&#13;
cover the foreign exchange risk over the life of the subloan.&#13;
15.   For sub-projects that are subject to prior review by the Bank, the initial approval is given&#13;
following this review and withdrawals can then be made for such subloans. The BBs will report to the&#13;
Bank regularly on other subloans it has approved. Once the financing of a sub-project is in place, the BB&#13;
will supervise its implementation in line with its usual commercial practices and fiduciary responsibilities.&#13;
16.   To implement and administer the project, each BB has appointed a project coordinator, who will&#13;
have overall responsibility for project implementation and supervision and for liaising with World Bank&#13;
staff and municipal beneficiaries on project implementation issues. The project coordinator will identify&#13;
staff assigned to handle the various tasks associated with loan implementation, administration and&#13;
monitoring. This team will be responsible for the following activities.&#13;
* Ensuring that loans are made to eligible beneficiaries in accordance with agreed criteria and&#13;
that these criteria are met before submission to the World Bank for review/approval of&#13;
applications (where necessary);&#13;
* Management and maintenance of records of the flow of resources, including loan accounts,&#13;
the special account, timely payments to suppliers and withdrawal of funds from the loan&#13;
account, and arrangements for audits in a timely manner;&#13;
* Administering the use of World Bank resources and ensuring that procurement, disbursement&#13;
and environmental procedures are followed;&#13;
* Preparing and submitting to the World Bank information on new subloans approved and short&#13;
semi-annual reports on the progress of the BB's subloan programn supported by the IBRD&#13;
loan.&#13;
C.    Procurement and Disbursements&#13;
procurement&#13;
17.   The loan will finance sub-projects for the modernization, rehabilitation, construction or&#13;
improvement of infrastructure for the municipalities or municipal enterprises. Because of the nature of&#13;
this project, it is not possible to estimate the total proportion of the goods and works to be procured&#13;
through ICB and therefore a detailed procurement table has not been prepared. However, to the extent&#13;
possible, it is expected that supply and installation contracts will be used. Items which cannot be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                 ANNEX 2a&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
incorporated into a such a contract will be procured separately, but efforts will be made to keep to a&#13;
minimum the procurement of separate items. A general procurement notice was published in the&#13;
Development Business in May 1997.&#13;
18.   ICB would be used for goods contracts in excess of US$400,000 and for contracts for works or&#13;
supply and installation estimated to cost more than US$5 million equivalent. In the ICB procurement of&#13;
goods, it is expected that bids would also include domestically manufactured goods. Therefore, in the&#13;
evaluation and comparison of these bids, Polish manufacturers will be granted a margin of preference of&#13;
15 percent or the relevant duty-whichever is lower--in accordance with the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines of August 1996. In accordance with these guidelines, the exceptions to ICB procurement will&#13;
be as follows:&#13;
*  Limited International Bidding (LIB). For goods and materials such as specialized equipment for&#13;
traffic management, water and wastewater treatment plants, which the Bank agrees are supplied&#13;
through a limited number of suppliers, and for the procurement of related parts and supplies,&#13;
procurement will be done following LIB procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines, which is&#13;
also in accordance with the Polish Public Procurement Law (PPL).&#13;
In addition to the above, a Country Procurement Assessment for Poland was undertaken in May-June&#13;
1995, during which time the Public Procurement Law, approved in June 1994, was reviewed in detail.&#13;
As a result of this review, it has been agreed that other procurement will be carried out in accordance with&#13;
the provisions of the PPL, subject to certain conditions as indicated below.&#13;
*  The Unlimited Tendering procedure provided for in the PPL will be used as National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB) for contracts for works, or for supply and installation contracts, estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$5 million per package, subject to the following conditions: (a) interested foreign&#13;
bidders would not be excluded; (b) domestic preference would not be applied; (c) the Bank's&#13;
standard prequalification documents (or alternatively a prequalification document agreed with the&#13;
Bank) would be used, if necessary; and (d) bidding documents for Unlimited Tendering&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank would be used.&#13;
* The Request for Quotations provided for in the PPL will be used as: (a) International Shopping&#13;
(IS) for small amounts of equipment and materials readily available off the shelf. Contracts for&#13;
equipment and for materials estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$400,000 per package&#13;
would be awarded under this procedure, based on comparing price quotations obtained from at&#13;
least three suppliers in two different countries, and (b) National Shopping (NS) for equipment and&#13;
materials estimated to cost up to US$100,000 per package that are readily available locally from&#13;
several suppliers at competitive prices, or for small works contracts up to $300,000 per contract.&#13;
19.   Procurement for consultant services and training. In general, engineering designs are expected to&#13;
be prepared as part of the works' contracts. However, a limited amount of consultants' services may also&#13;
be required by the final borrowers to prepare the final designs of proposed project investments. Such&#13;
contracts are not expected to exceed US$150,000 each, up to a total amount of about US$1 million.&#13;
Consultants' services required under the project will be procured in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (August 1981). As a well-developed engineering industry exists in&#13;
Poland, substantial involvement of Polish consultants is expected in carrying out the engineering design&#13;
work. In most cases, qualified short-listed firms (or individuals) will be invited to submit proposals and&#13;
will be selected on a competitive basis. In some cases, direct contracting may be justified because of the&#13;
advantage of requesting consultants (domestic as well as foreign) who prepare the feasibility studies to&#13;
provide help in drawing up detailed engineering designs. Additional consultants' services and training are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43                                  ANNEX 2a&#13;
Page 7 of 9&#13;
to be financed from grants provided from other donors, including EU-Phare and USAID, in accordance&#13;
with their respective guidelines.&#13;
20.    Procurement review. For procurement by ICB and LIB, Bank's standard (pre-printed) bidding&#13;
documents will be used. Prior Bank review and approval will be required for all ICB and LIB&#13;
procurement. In addition, the first procurement package for each bank to be procured by NCB&#13;
(Unlimnited Tendering) will require prior review by the Bank. All other procurement will be reviewed ex&#13;
post on a selective basis. For procurement of consultants services, prior Bank review will be required for&#13;
all terms of reference and for consultant contracts above US$100,000 for frms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals. Consultants' contracts below these amounts would be reviewed ex post on a selective basis.&#13;
In addition, all documents for any direct contracting of consultants will be subject to the Bank's prior&#13;
review. Each beneficiary municipality will retain all procurement documentation for investrnents and&#13;
consultants financed from subloans under the project. The documents will be available for review by&#13;
Bank missions. Table 2 summarizes the proposed review limits.&#13;
21.    Procurement Responsibility.  The BBs will ensure that procurement under the investments&#13;
financed is in accordance with the agreed procedures. The subloan agreements will also reflect this&#13;
provision. The capacity of the BBs to carry out this review is currently limited but staff are well qualified&#13;
and initial training has already been provided. Additional training in Bank procurement and disbursement&#13;
procedures will be arranged, including at a project launch workshop tentatively scheduled for October&#13;
1997.&#13;

Disbursements and Special Account&#13;
22.   The loan will finance up to 100 percent of the amounts disbursed by the BBs for eligible&#13;
subloans. These disbursements will be limited in turn to: (a) 75 percent of the cost of any sub-project&#13;
financed; (b) eligible expenditures, i.e., contracts for works, equipment and services procured in&#13;
accordance with procurement arrangements agreed with the Bank; and (c) expenditures made up to 180&#13;
days prior to the date of receipt by the Bank of a request to finance from the Loan subloans for US$2.5&#13;
million or more, or prior to the date of signature of the subloan agreement for subloans below US$2.5&#13;
million.&#13;
23.   Disbursements for subloans of less than US$2.5 million equivalent will be on the basis of&#13;
statements of expenditures, which detail the individual transactions by the borrowing banks. The&#13;
documentation to support these expenditures will be retained by BBs.  Municipalities will retain&#13;
detailed documentation for each individual transaction. All documentation will be made available to the&#13;
Bank on request. Applications for withdrawals against subloans above US$2.5 million will be fully&#13;
documented. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account may be established by each BB, with a&#13;
total authorized allocation of up to US$2.5 million equivalent for PBK and US$1.3 million equivalent&#13;
for BISE. The initial authorized allocation for PBK will be US$1.3 million equivalent, until the&#13;
aggregate amount of withdrawals from its special account exceeds US$3.8 million equivalent. The&#13;
initial authorized allocation for BISE will be US$0.6 million equivalent, until the aggregate amount of&#13;
withdrawals from its special accounts exceeds US$2.9 million equivalent.&#13;
24.   Disbursements against individual subloans will be managed by the lending BB, which will be&#13;
responsible for ensuring that claims for payments are made against approved contracts and that&#13;
adequate supporting documentation is provided.&#13;
25.   The detailed disbursement schedule is provided in Annex 4. Given the pilot nature of this&#13;
operation and the state of preparation of the initial sub-projects, disbursements are expected to be&#13;
spread over 4.5 years, somewhat faster than the Bank-wide profile. It is anticipated that total loan&#13;
proceeds will be committed against subloans within 3 years of loan effectiveness. Based on this&#13;
schedule, the expected completion date for the project is June 30, 2001, and the Closing Date is&#13;
December 31, 2001.&#13;
D.    Reporting and Audits&#13;
26.   The project account, Special Account and Statements of Expenditure will be maintained by&#13;
each BB for each loan and will be audited at the end of each fiscal year in accordance with international&#13;
standards. Assurances were obtained from each Borrower during negotiations that it will appoint&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that it will present to the Bank, within six months after&#13;
the end of each fiscal year, audited financial statements, with an opinion on the project records and,&#13;
showing the financial performance and position of the bank. The financial statement of the final&#13;
beneficiaries will be audited in accordance with Polish law. The audit reports for the final beneficiaries&#13;
will be retained by the respective BB and made available to the Bank on request.&#13;
27.   The borrowing banks will maintain financial records of the project.  For subloans below&#13;
US$2.5 million, which do not require prior review by the Bank, and for which disbursements are made&#13;
-from the Special Account, the BBs will provide the Bank with a summary report on each subloan&#13;
approved before corresponding replenishments to the Special Account are requested. The BBs will also&#13;
provide semi-annual progress reports to the Bank on sub-project performance, including information on&#13;
financing applications received, processed and status, records of subloans granted to municipalities and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45                                    ANNEX 2a&#13;
Page 9 of 9&#13;
summaries of implementation progress, including repayment information. In addition, this report will&#13;
be supplemented annually by a short assessment by the BB of project implementation progress. The&#13;
format of these reports was agreed with the borrowers during negotiations. In addition, assurances&#13;
were also obtained during negotiations, that the each BB will prepare an implementation completion&#13;
report and submit this to the Bank within six months after the closing date of the loan.&#13;
E.    Project Supervision&#13;
28.    The focus of Bank supervision will be to: (a) review development of the project pipeline,&#13;
including progress in contracting and completing feasibility studies; (b) verify that onlending&#13;
arrangements are satisfactory and that commitments of municipal loans are proceeding; (c) verify that&#13;
the BBs are familiar with Bank procurement guidelines and disbursement procedures; (d) verify that&#13;
repayments of subloans are satisfactory; (e) ascertain whether project-related technical assistance is&#13;
being provided through MDA or other sources; and (f) review development of the municipal credit&#13;
market. As part of regular monitoring of project progress, supervision missions will also: (a) carry out&#13;
an ex-post review of a sampling of sub-projects, including contract bids and awards, disbursement&#13;
procedures and record keeping. In addition, by end-1999, BBs and the Bank will jointly undertake a&#13;
mid-term review of implementation progress and compliance with loan covenants.&#13;
29.   It is anticipated that project supervision will require an above average effort, with a heavier&#13;
concentration in the first two years of implementation, because of the support required to appraise sub-&#13;
projects. Over the life of the project, the supervision effort is expected to average about 16 staff weeks&#13;
per year. Ongoing support for day-to-day activities is also anticipated from the Resident Mission&#13;
(about 6 staffweeks) and is expected to increase over time as its staff develops experience and assumes&#13;
responsibility for sub-project review.&#13;

SAMPLE APPRAISAL REPORT WITH SUPPORTING FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
PULAWY SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT COMPLIANCE WITH ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA&#13;
(APPRAISAL REPORT)1&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Pulawy is an industrial city located on the right bank of the Vistula River, about 120 km southeast&#13;
of Warsaw, in the Lublin Voivodship. The present population of Pulawy is 54,600, and over the next&#13;
twenty years, the annual growth rate of the population is expected to be 0.4 percent. The main industry in&#13;
Pulawy is the nitrogen chemical complex. Approximately 11,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste are&#13;
produced per year; an average of 0.6 kg of waste are produced by each inhabitant per day. Solid waste&#13;
production is growing at a per capita rate of 1.5 percent.&#13;
2.     The current solid waste collection services are provided by (i) MZUK, a municipal department&#13;
(zaklad budzetowy) employing 60 people and providing services to about 75 percent of the waste&#13;
collection market; and (ii) "Komunalnik", a private collection operator covering about 20 percent of the&#13;
clients. The existing solid waste containers are in bad condition, and about 45 percent of them require&#13;
urgent replacement. Approximately 30 tonnes of solid waste are collected daily by the both companies.&#13;
Fees are collected directly from clients, either single family homeowners, apartment owners associations,&#13;
or municipal housing complexes. The fee for household waste collection is about US$0.3/capita/month,&#13;
equivalent to US$12/tonne. MZUK currently has a fleet of 6 seven-year old collection vehicles, of which&#13;
only one is a 16 m3 compactor vehicle.&#13;
3.    The present municipal dump is located 10 km to the southwest of the city at Trzcianki. Its useful&#13;
life was extended by the recent purchase of a compactor and by other works and it can be utilized for a&#13;
maximum of two more years. The dump is only partially fenced, and there is neither leachate and gas&#13;
management nor weight control of solid waste. The waste is not covered with earth. The soil is&#13;
permeable and the impact on groundwater and soil is estimated to be significant. The current tipping fee&#13;
is about US$8/tonne.&#13;
Proposed Project&#13;
4.    Within the proposed solid waste management project, solid waste storage will be handled by 250&#13;
containers of 1,100 liter unit capacity and 400 containers of 260 liter unit capacity. To introduce solid&#13;
waste recycling, 250 paper/glass/can separation containers and a hydraulic lift vehicle will be bought.&#13;
5.    To complete MZUK service coverage, three 16m3 compactor vehicles and a sidewalk sweeping&#13;
vehicle will also be purchased under the proposed project.&#13;
6.    The present dump at Trzcianki will be closed and rehabilitated, and a new sanitary landfill at&#13;
Wolka Profecka will be built. The new landfill located 7 km to the northeast of the city, will be equipped&#13;
with a geomembrane liner, leachate and gas management system, fence, weigh bridge and adequate&#13;
vehicles and equipment. The construction of the new sanitary landfill will occur in zones, over the life of&#13;
the site (about 20 years).&#13;
Based on information available at the time of project appraisal (mid-1996).&#13;
&#13;

sorting plan equipped with trommel, crusher and baling system, will also be constructed.&#13;
Appraisal Criteria&#13;
8.     Commuuity Suort. Several preparatory studies were ordered by the City, including the Pre-&#13;
feasibility Study (Zalozenia Techniczno-Economiczne) by Bipro-Bumar in 1994, MZUK Restructuring&#13;
Study by Bain &amp; Company in 1994, and Feasibility Study by Ekolog in 1995. The proposed project was&#13;
ratified by the Environmental Department of the Voivodship of Lublin, and localization of the new&#13;
facilities was approved by the City Council and the City Board.&#13;
9.     Eeasibility. The feasibility study carried out in August 1995 by Ekolog, defined and justified in&#13;
technical, economic, financial and environmental terms the investment prograrn. Three alternatives were&#13;
considered, i.e., (i) development of a new sanitary landfill only; (ii) construction of a sanitary landfill with&#13;
composting and recycling facilities; and (iii) transfer of Pulawy waste to Lublin landfill 50 km away. The&#13;
proposed project was retained as the most viable and least-cost solution. The additional financial analysis&#13;
showed that debt service as a percentage of City's current revenues varies from 1.2 to 6.3 percent over&#13;
the life of the loan (10-year maturity and 3-year grace period), and that the debt coverage ratio drops to its&#13;
lowest point (3.3) in the Year 2000.&#13;
10.   Environmental Nsse. While the proposed project is expected to have a positive environmental&#13;
impact by eliminating the uncontrolled dump and improving solid waste management in Pulawy, the&#13;
possibility that some of its components could have negative impacts if mismanaged caused it to be subject&#13;
to an environmental assessment consistent with both Polish and World Bank environmental procedures.&#13;
The environmental assessment for the localization and sizing of the sanitary landfill, and recycling and&#13;
composting facilities have been prepared by local consultants, and an environmental permit was issued by&#13;
the Voivodship Environmental Department. The City has not received and does not expect to receive any&#13;
adverse public reaction to the proposed investments, and no involuntary resettlement is anticipated.&#13;
11.   Commercialiagtion. In 1994 Pulawy received advice from the management consultants Bain &amp;&#13;
Company in evaluating and managing the options for restructuring MZUK. Despite the unsuccessful&#13;
attempt of the privatization of solid waste services in 1995, Pulawy is still determined to (i) restructure its&#13;
MZUK; (ii) involve the private sector in financing and operating of solid waste management facilities; and&#13;
(iii) limit the City's role to the enforcement and monitoring of contracts and performance control.&#13;
12.   Cost Recovery. In order to recover from user charges the operation and maintenance costs with&#13;
project and to service the debt, the new tipping fee was estimated at about US$15/tonne. This represents&#13;
a substantial increase in the present fees level. However, similar or higher tipping fees are already&#13;
applied in several other cities (e.g., Gorzow Wielkopolski, Jastrzebie Zdroj, Poznan) and have proved to&#13;
be affordable.&#13;
13.    Readinss. The detailed design (Projekt Techniczny) of the first zone of the new sanitary landfill&#13;
is under preparation and the construction works are scheduled to shortly. The City is also ready to call&#13;
for tenders for the detailed design of recycling and composting facilities.&#13;

PROJECT INFORMATION - PULAWY&#13;
Priority Pdrject          Solid waste management - Construciion of new landfill, which&#13;
will include a composting plant and recycling facilities,&#13;
rehabilitation of the existing landfill and improvement of solid&#13;
waste collection and separation.&#13;
Investor / Borrower       City of Pulawy.&#13;
Estimated Costs     :     PLN 19.2 million or US$7.68 million, for civil works,&#13;
equipment and technical assistance, including contingencies.&#13;
Estimated Loan Amnt:       US$4,140,000 (50 percent of project costs).&#13;
Status of PMie            The detailed design (Projekt Techniczny) of the first zone of&#13;
the new landfill has been completed and bids invited for the&#13;
civil works. Works could start shortly. The city is preparing&#13;
to call for tenders for the detailed design of the recycling and&#13;
composting facilities.&#13;
Borrowing Capacity        Initial estimates indicate that repayment of a US$4,140,000&#13;
MFP loan entirely from the city budget is possible and within&#13;
the financial capacity of Pulawy, though overall investment&#13;
spending may be restricted by debt service requirements.&#13;
Basis for Loan Paym        Although Pulawy could repay a loan from general municipal&#13;
revenues, an investment component should be incorporated in&#13;
the solid waste tariff/tipping fee, to repay part of the loan.&#13;
Recommnendation     :     This preparation of this project appears to be well advanced&#13;
and it should be considered for inclusion in the first batch of&#13;
MFP loans.&#13;

PULAWY&#13;
1. &#13;
In 1994 and 1995, Pulawy participated in a program financed by the Restructuring and&#13;
Privatization of Municipal Enterprises Program of the Cooperation Fund. Aided by Bain &amp;&#13;
Company consultants, municipal and municipal enterprise officials created a pilot task force to&#13;
elaborate management tools, define strategic and operational objectives and develop performance&#13;
and financial control indicators for street cleaning and waste management services. The Polish&#13;
firm Ekolog prepared detailed activity and investment plans for the sector, which became the basis&#13;
of a feasibility study completed by Ekolog in early 1995.&#13;
The most urgent needs in this sector are the preparation of a new landfill site, including the&#13;
construction of a composing plant and recycling facilities, closure and rehabilitation of the existing&#13;
landfill site and the acquisition of containers and vehicles to improve solid waste services. The&#13;
current landfill at Trzcianki, whose useful life was extended by the purchase of a compactor and&#13;
by other works, can be utilized only until 1997-98. The site of a new landfill at Wolka Profecka&#13;
has been approved by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and a permit was issued by the&#13;
Voivodship Environmental Department. The city was planning to issue a call for tenders for the&#13;
detailed design of the recycling and composting facilities.&#13;
The question of restructuring MZUK, the municipal solid waste and services company has not yet&#13;
been resolved, as the City Council decided it wished to retain a majority stake in the company.&#13;
Nevertheless, Pulawy is still determined to restructure MZUK, involve the private sector in&#13;
fmancing and operating solid waste management facilities and thereby, limit the city's role to&#13;
enforcement and monitoring of contracts and performance control.&#13;
2.     PRQOJIFCTCOSTS&#13;
Estimated project costs for Pulawy's solid waste management strategy include:&#13;
PLNQ'O        US$000&#13;
Solid waste collection and separation            1,700           680&#13;

TOTAL (Civil Works and Equipment)                15,400        6,160&#13;
Total costs, including contingencies (physical and prices), and excluding consultant services,&#13;
would bring the estimated project costs to PLN 17.7 million or JS$7.08 million.&#13;
3.     STATUS OF MZUK&#13;
MZUK (Miejskie Zarzad Uslug Komunalna) is a municipal services company structured as a&#13;
zaklad budzetowe. This company is responsible for six different activities: waste collection, solid&#13;
waste landfill management, street cleaning, greenery, cemetery management and funeral services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 9 of 14&#13;
For waste collection and street cleaning, Bain suggested the creation of a joint venture with an&#13;
external investor. For waste collection services, the role of the city would include enforcement&#13;
and monitoring of contracts and performance control of the waste collecting company.&#13;
For landfill operations, MZUK should continue to operate the current landfill, until its closure and&#13;
recultivation around 1997. For the moment, the municipality is proceeding directly with the&#13;
preparation of the new landfill, including the composting and recycling plants. The question of&#13;
the restructuring of MZUK is likely to be debated again in 1996. Pulawy has not abandoned its&#13;
interest in restructuring MZUK and involving the private sector in financing and operation of&#13;
solid waste management facilities.&#13;
4.  FINANCIAX CONDMON OF MZUK&#13;
MZUK operates the current landfill, and will continue to do so until this site is closed within the&#13;
next two years. The budget of MZUK was not provided during the consultant's visit. According&#13;
to Pulawy's draft 1995 budget, no direct subsidy was paid to MZUK in 1994 nor was planned in&#13;
1995. It is difficult to determiine from the budget documents the cost to the city of street cleaning&#13;
and greenery maintenance. MZUK employs about 60 people and provides services to about 75&#13;
percent of the waste collection market.&#13;
Current fees for household waste collection are about US$0.3 per capita per month, equivalent to&#13;
US$12/ton. The tipping fee for the present landfill is US$8/ton. It has been estimated that in&#13;
order to recover the costs of operation and maintenance of the new landfill and to service the debt&#13;
from user charges, a new tipping fee would have to be set at US$15/ton, an increase of over 80&#13;
percent over current charges.&#13;
5.  FINANCIAL CNDMN OPULAY&#13;
Comparison of Pulawy's current revenues with 1994 national and population category (50-&#13;
300,000) averages indicates that the city's per capita current revenues are about 14 percent higher&#13;
than the national average and 2 percent higher than the population category average.&#13;
Own revenues account for 45 percent of current revenues in 1994 and 41 percent in 1995 (Table&#13;
2), which is slightly higher than comparable population ratios and similar to the national average.&#13;
The level of property tax revenues is particularly high, at 29-42 percent of current revenues,&#13;
compared to 18 and 13 percent for the national and population averages, respectively. The share&#13;
of PIT represents 16 percent of current revenues. Pulawy's savings capacity2, at 24 percent in&#13;
1995, is at the average nationally and higher than the population category, as is the investment&#13;
effort of 17-19 percent of expenditures3.&#13;
The 1995 actual budget resulted in a surplus equal to almost 7 percent of current revenues,&#13;
compared to a 2 percent deficit the previous year. Total 1995 current revenues were PLN 32.1&#13;
million, which is a 19 percent real increase, given 30 percent inflation. The big change in&#13;
revenues was a considerable jump in corporate income tax (CMT) income, from PLN 3.9 million&#13;
to 1994 to PLN 8.4 million in 1995. It would be necessary to determine the source of this&#13;

increased income from corporate income tax, in particular to determine whether this level of&#13;
revenue from this tax will be sustained in future years, or whether this constituted a one-off&#13;
payment of delinquent taxes by the city's largest companies. Current expenditures registered a&#13;
real increase of only half this level (9 percent).&#13;
Education is the sector of greatest spending, at 40 percent of the total, followed by municipal&#13;
economy (17 percent) and municipal housing and communal services (13 percent) (See Table 3).&#13;
Planned investments for 1995 are PLN 4.4 million, and actual investment, PLN 5.5 million. Over&#13;
50 percent of investment was targeted for municipal housing and property and 45 percent for&#13;
municipal economy. The largest individual investment projects in 1995 were PLN 970,000 for&#13;
rainwater drainage, PLN 400,000 for one road rehabilitation project and PLN 300,000 for&#13;
renovation of a municipal building.&#13;
6.     BORROWING CAPACITY&#13;
An estimate of Pulawy's loan payment capacity was calculated on the basis of a US$4.1 million&#13;
loan (50 percent of current estimates for equipment, civil works and technical assistance on the&#13;
solid waste management project).&#13;
The estimated conditions of the MFP loan forecast for Pulawy are:&#13;
1996  1997   1998   1999  2000  2001 and ff.&#13;
Inflation (%)      18.2  14.7   11.2  9.0    7.0    5.0&#13;
Devaluation (%)    12.7  10.2    7.8  6.3    4.9    3.5&#13;
1996   1997   1998   1999  2000  2001   2002  2003  2004  2005&#13;
Forex rate  2.85   2.94   3.08   3.28   3.44   3.56   3.69   3.82   3.96   4.10&#13;
Current revenues increase at 3 points less than inflation;&#13;
Current expenditures increase at the rate of inflation in 1996 and at 3 points less than inflation&#13;
for the rest of the period;&#13;
Net savings as a percentage of current revenue are estimated at 22.1 percent over the period;&#13;
Capital expenditures (financed from net savings) vary from 16.0 to 22 percent of total&#13;
expenditures;&#13;
Loan disbursements are calculated in US$, with US$2.1 million disbursed annually in 1997 and&#13;
1998;&#13;
Loan payments (principal + interest) are calculated in PLN, at the estimated US$JPLN&#13;
exchange rate for the year of payment. Pulawy bears the foreign exchange risk;&#13;
Terms of credit are 10 year maturity, 3 year grace period for principal payments;&#13;
Interest is variable, and includes:&#13;
- expanded US$ LIBOR cost: estimated LIBOR + World Bank spread (not counting&#13;
eventual waivers), and;&#13;
- the commercial bank spread of 2.5 points (the commercial bank spread also covers the&#13;
cost of the guarantee fee and commitment fee).&#13;
Based on these estimates, the debt coverage ratio falls to its lowest point at 3.3 in 2000. Debt&#13;
service as a percent of current revenues does not exceed 6.6 percent at any time during loan&#13;
repayments. Table 1 below indicates the budget impact for Pulawy of this estimate. Given these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 11 of 14&#13;
assumptions, and assuming that the city can maintain as high a savings rate as in 1995, the&#13;
municipal budget could bear a loan of US$4,140,000.&#13;
Nevertheless, cost recovery should be an important element of this project and an increase of solid&#13;
waste tariffs and/or tipping fees to finance all or a portion of projected debt payments should be&#13;
considered.&#13;

7.    CONCLUDING REMARKS&#13;
Based on information of 1994 and 1995 budgets, the municipal finances of Pulawy appear to be in&#13;
an acceptable situation. The loan forecast does indicate that Pulawy has the financial capacity to&#13;
repay a loan, but it is advised that solid waste fees also be dedicated to loan payment. A feasibility&#13;
study has been prepared and it is recommended that Pulawy be included in the first batch of&#13;
projects for financing under the MFP loan.&#13;
4/    This estimate does not account for any other possible sources of financing of capital expenditures, such as&#13;
grants or loans and covers only capital expenditures which could be financed by the estimated level of net savings.&#13;

REVIEW OF THE PARTICIPATING BANKS&#13;
1.    Descriptions of each of the two Participating Banks are given below.&#13;
A. BANK INICJATYW SPOLECZNO-EKONOMICZNYCH SA (BISE)&#13;
2.     Background. BISE was established in 1990 as a joint venture among, primarily, the Polish&#13;
Government Labor Fund (LF), the Polish Industrial Development Agency (IDA), and France's small&#13;
business financing agency, the Caisse Centrale de Credit Cooperatif (CC). BISE's purpose was to provide&#13;
financial support to the development of privately owned small businesses and to stimulate development of&#13;
small towns and rural communities, especially in regions of structural unemployment. BISE's ownership&#13;
presently is 44 percent State (primarily LF and IDA) and 56 percent private (primarily Credit Foncier de&#13;
France, CC and, more recently, Credit Industriel d'Alsace et de Lorraine). The original French&#13;
shareholders have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, significant technical assistance in the&#13;
areas of municipal lending and housing finance, including some residential mortgage refinancing facilities&#13;
(Credit Foncier), and in small business lending (CC).&#13;
3.     Present Status. BISE is a comparatively small, over capitalized bank with only two branches. Its&#13;
over-capitalized position produces a low return on equity (ROE), but provides room for growth and&#13;
protection for the significant portion of its loan portfolio which is in the relatively high risk small business&#13;
sector. BISE's management seems competent, has a clear view of the bank's defined mission, and is&#13;
committed to a policy of cautious growth, including the introduction of new products (e.g., factoring and&#13;
lease financing). It intends to increase selectively its branch network in order to expand further BISE's&#13;
loan and deposit base, thus conservatively increasing leverage and ROE over time. It also plans to&#13;
improve its operating efficiency through the upgrading of its information technology and data processing&#13;
systems. The bank is about to move its Head Office into its newly constructed building. About 77&#13;
percent of BISE's loans are to private sector companies and individuals, 22 percent are to governmental&#13;
entities (primarily municipal), and 1 percent are to large state enterprises.&#13;
4.     Financial Condition and Operating Results. At the end of 1996, BISE's total assets were PLN&#13;
155.6 million (liquid assets PLN 9.3 million, net loans PLN 64.5 million, and net fixed assets PLN 25.7&#13;
million); total liabilities were PLN 111.6 million (deposits PLN 63.7 million); and total capital was PLN&#13;
44.0 million. BISE's 12 months' gross income before expenses increased from PLN 11.5 million in 1995&#13;
to PLN 14.6 million in 1996. This increase of 27 percent, although substantial, is somewhat lower than&#13;
the 66 percent increase in 1995, indicating that BISE's rate of growth is decelerating. Net income after all&#13;
expenses, but before income tax, which increased from PLN 376 thousand in 1994 to PLN 1.3 million in&#13;
1995, increased by only 9 percent in 1996 to PLN 1.4 million, largely as a result of a 34 percent increase&#13;
in operating expenses. On an after tax basis, because of a changes in the income tax law, net income in&#13;
1995 increased only from PLN 318 thousand to PLN 398 thousand (27 percent). After tax net income&#13;
increased by 30 percent in 1996, to PLN 515 thousand. Net pre-tax income as a percent of gross income&#13;
was 5.6 percent in 1994 and 10.5 percent in 1996, an indication of improving operational efficiency as&#13;
well as a reflection of increased volume. BISE's "problem" is an unacceptably low return on equity&#13;
(ROE was 1.4 percent on average capital employed in 1995 and 1996), a function of its overcapitalized&#13;
condition and relatively low profitability (its overall return, e.g., on assets, is more satisfactory). This low&#13;
return was further compounded in 1996 by the increase in the bank's share capital from PLN 30.5 million&#13;
to PLN 40.9 million resulting from the purchase of new shares of the Polish Industrial Development&#13;
&#13;

Agency and of the Credit Industriel d'Alsace et de Lorraine. Management recognizes the ROE problem&#13;
and is continuing its efforts to increase profitability and "grow" the balance sheet.&#13;
5.     Asset Quality. BISE's gross loan portfolio increased from PLN 49 million at December 31,&#13;
1995, to PLN 68.9 million at December 31, 1996, an increase of 41 percent. Commercial loans&#13;
constituted 59 percent of the portfolio in 1995 and 63 percent in 1996, while housing loans were 17&#13;
percent and 9 percent respectively.  "Irregular" loans have been reduced from  15.4 percent of the&#13;
portfolio in 1994 to 10 percent in 1995 and 8 percent in 1996, a substantial improvement, but still rather&#13;
high, given the small business nature of much of BISE's loan portfolio. The improvement came about as&#13;
a result of a reduction in problem loans and an increase in the total portfolio. Management believes&#13;
BISE's asset quality compares favorably with other Polish banks; however, it continues to institute steps to&#13;
reduce problem loans still further and is satisfied that the quality of new loans is improving.&#13;
6.     Capital Adequacy. BISE continues to be overcapitalized. Total equity at December 31, 1996&#13;
was PLN 44 million (40 percent of total liabilities and 37 percent of non-weighted risk assets), marginally&#13;
less conservative than the comparable ratios for the previous year (48 percent and 40 percent,&#13;
respectively). The auditor (Price Waterhouse) did not calculate BISE's risk-weighted capital adequacy&#13;
ratio, but had it done so, the ratio would very substantially exceed the NBP's 8 percent minimum.&#13;
7.     Liquidity. There were some changes in the maturity profile of BISE's loan portfolio in 1996,&#13;
with 42 percent of its loans maturing in up to one year, 31 percent in 1-5 years, and 27 percent in over 5&#13;
years, compared to 40 percent, 43 percent and 17 percent, respectively, in 1995.  This moderate&#13;
lengthening of risk asset maturities was more than offset by a significant lengthening of maturities in&#13;
funding provided by financial institutions--over 62 percent of funding resources matured in over 5 years&#13;
and only 5 percent in less than one year. In addition, about 91 percent of the bank's deposits matured in&#13;
less than one year. Thus, in contrast to what is more common with other Polish banks, BISE is not&#13;
"borrowing short and lending long." The above relationships, together with the bank's strong capital&#13;
position, obviate any need for concern for BISE's liquidity condition.&#13;
8.     Conclusions. BISE has:&#13;
*      a clear strategy for cautious growth including more active involvement in&#13;
municipal financing;&#13;
*      a strong capital position and attendant capacity for growth;&#13;
*      a modest and declining amount of irregular (i.e., problem) loans;&#13;
*      a conservative, committed, and competent management;&#13;
*      strong and supportive foreign shareholders; and&#13;
*      experience in municipal finance.&#13;

B. POWSZECHNY BANK KREDYTOWY SA w WARSZAWIE (PBK)&#13;
9.    Background. PBK is one of nine regional banks spun off from the National Bank of Poland&#13;
(NBP) in 1989. It is currently 100 percent state-owned and is scheduled to be privatized in the next three-&#13;
six months, with about 65 percent being sold through private placement, 15 percent distributed to&#13;
employees, 15 percent sold through the stock exchange and 5 percent retained by the Government to settle&#13;
restitution claims. At the end of 1996, PBK owned 21.5 percent of Kredyt Bank (KB), an important&#13;
private Polish bank. KB intends to acquire a small stake in PBK when the latter is privatized. In June&#13;
1995 PBK acquired a 50 percent interest in Gornoslaski Bank Gospodarczy (GBG) as a means of&#13;
expanding into the Silesia region. At a cost of $5.7 million, GBG was one of the largest bank acquisitions&#13;
in Poland. A 33 percent interest in the Polish Development Bank was acquired in October 1996 through a&#13;
PLN 8 million increase in the bank's share capital. After a period of management instability, the present&#13;
Chief Executive Officer was appointed in October 1995. The present management is seen as more&#13;
progressive than its predecessors. The bank extensively restructured its Head Office organization early&#13;
1996.&#13;
10.   Present Status. PBK inherited 37 branches from NBP, and its present network of 47 branches&#13;
represents a strong presence in Warsaw, as well as in the northeast and south. PBK has been relatively&#13;
slow to open new branches, but is seeking to expand its branch network further in the country's higher&#13;
growth areas. PBK's ability to provide full service to its nationwide customers has been restricted because&#13;
its branch system is not connected on-line. Management expects to remedy this deficiency within two&#13;
years (an integrated information technology system is being implemented). PBK's goal is to become a&#13;
broadly based commercial bank providing a wide range of banking and financial services to companies&#13;
and individuals. However, 55 percent of PBK's loans continue to be to state enterprises, with a significant&#13;
portion in the heavy industry and coal mining sectors, a legacy of the 1989 NBP spin-off. The bank's&#13;
municipal lending has been modest, presently constituting less than 2 percent of loan assets. PBK&#13;
received extensive training and advisory assistance under the Financial Institutions Development Loan&#13;
(Loan 3341) through a twinning agreement with San Paolo Bank (Turin), which expired at end-1994.&#13;
11.   Financial Condition. PBK's performance and strength have continued to improve since 1994.&#13;
PBK's total assets increased by 25 percent by end 1996, to PLN 9,244 million (cash/due from banks,&#13;
including NBP: PLN 2,173 million; net loans PLN 3,284 million; bonds and treasury bills PLN 3,023&#13;
million), compared to an increase of 29 percent by the end of 1995. Total liabilities were PLN 8,224&#13;
million (deposits PLN 4,770 million); and total capital was PLN 988 million. Over the same period, total&#13;
equity increased by 49 percent, primarily as a result of net earnings retained from 1996 operating results&#13;
and from the in-kind capital contribution by the State Treasury of Polish Development Bank shares. For&#13;
the year ending December 31, 1996, PBK's net profit was PLN 223.8 million, a return on equity of 27.1&#13;
percent, compared to 19.5 percent for 1995 (inflation was 18.5 percent).&#13;
12.   Loan Portfolio. PBK's loan portfolio increased by 52 percent (to PLN 3,283 million) over the&#13;
year, with the ratio of loans to deposits increasing from 48 percent in 1995 to 54 percent in 1996.&#13;
Although 55 percent of the bank's lending continues to be to the state-owned sector, the number of&#13;
borrowers has increased by 30 percent, with 42 borrowers constituting 58 percent of total loans, with&#13;
good implications for risk diversification. All irregular loans are fully provisioned according to NBP&#13;
requirements. The "irregular" portion of the bank's loan portfolio continues its improving trend, from 32&#13;
percent in 1994, to 26 percent in 1995 and 16 percent in 1996, confirming the bank's reputation for&#13;
diligence in problem loan workouts.&#13;

13.    Capital Adequacy. Although the auditors do not provide a calculation of PBK's capital adequacy&#13;
ratio on a risk-weighted basis, a simplified calculation shows that total equity and non-equity reserves&#13;
constituted 14 percent of total liabilities at end-1996. This represents a continued strengthening over&#13;
previous years and a calculation on a risk-weighted basis should result in a significantly higher percentage,&#13;
well above NBP's 8 percent minimum requirement. In 1993 the bank's capital position was strengthened&#13;
through receipt of US$91 million in Restructuring Bonds from the Polish government.&#13;
14.    Liquidity. Although PBK still has an asset/liability mismatch (a common characteristic of banks&#13;
in Poland) it did improve its liquidity in 1996 by shortening the maturity profile of both its loans and&#13;
deposits. At end-1996, about 98 percent of deposits had maturities of up to one year. In contrast, 47&#13;
percent of the loan portfolio matured within one year, 27 percent matured within 5 years and 26 percent&#13;
had maturities of over 5 years (down from 41 percent in 1995). The continued evolution toward a full&#13;
market economy and the demands for capital associated with this evolution produce strong pressures to&#13;
provide term financing. The money market is currently, however, unwilling, or unable, to invest long&#13;
term and, by "borrowing short" and "lending long," Polish banks are intermediating between the need of&#13;
capital users for long-term finance and the desire of capital providers to invest only short term. Such a&#13;
policy is potentially problematic for all banks. To some extent, PBK partially mitigates these concerns by&#13;
its strong capital adequacy.  Participation in the MFP will also help in diversifying its risk asset&#13;
concentration and extending the maturity of its liabilities.&#13;
15.    Operating Results.  PBK's operating income mix changed in 1996, and its after tax profit&#13;
improved substantially from PLN 121 million in 1995 to PLN 224 million in 1996.1 However, gross&#13;
interest income increased only from PLN 1,174 million in 1995 to PLN 1,218 million (3.7 percent) in&#13;
1996. At the same time, interest expense declined by 10.5 percent. This, together with a 38 percent&#13;
increase in fee and conmmission income, produced a 29 percent increase in net banking income (PLN 669&#13;
million) in 1996. PBK's operating expenses, which increased substantially in 1995, increased by a further&#13;
25 percent in 1996, mostly because of a 27 percent increase in personnel expenses. Management is aware&#13;
that its excessive staff and attendant payroll expenses are a drag on the bank's profitability and recently&#13;
has recently completed (by major management consultant firm) a thorough analysis of the bank's&#13;
operations. In spite of the rise in the above expenses, the bank's operating efficiency improved slightly in&#13;
1996, with expenses being 34.7 percent of banking income, compared to 35.9 percent in 1995.&#13;
16.    Conclusions. PBK appears to have overcome its earlier period of management instability and&#13;
organizational change. A large proportion of its risk assets continue to be invested in the state-owned,&#13;
heavy industry sector. Although its internal electronic information systems are presently underdeveloped,&#13;
they are in the process of being brought up to international standards. It has only modest experience in&#13;
municipal lending, but plans to staff up to handle the MFP project. The bank has the following additional&#13;
strengths:&#13;
*      present management is considered progressive and committed to change;&#13;
*      the bank's capital position is more than adequate;&#13;
*      problem loans are fully provisioned, workouts are actively pursued and the share of bad&#13;
loans is declining;&#13;
*      privatization is scheduled to occur in the coming three-six months; and&#13;
*      geographic representation is wide through an expanding branch network.&#13;
*      The 1995 results reflected new statutory provisions for deferred income tax, with PLN 114 million of the 1995&#13;
income tax of PLN 133 million being for deferred taxes.)&#13;

            Poland - Municipal Finance Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main goal of the Municipal Finance
            Project is to promote the development of a credit market for
            municipal investment in Poland.  To this end, the project
            pursues the following two inter-related objectives.  First,
            it will provide long-term financial resources to commercial
            banks for municipal lending in the infrastructure sector.
            And second, it will help the banks identify and prepare a
            sustained pipeline of viable investment projects, backed by
            creditworthy towns or local utilities. The project will
            consist of a single-currency loan to each of two selected
            commercial banks.  The loans finance a program of long term
            subloans issued by these banks to municipalities and
            revenue-earning municipal service enterprises.  The project
            will also promote the channeling of donor-provided technical
            assistance resources (through the Municipal Development
            Agency-MDA) to market participants including: 1)
            municipalities, in the areas of project preparation and
            financial management; 2) banks, for appraising municipal
            credit and structuring robust loan security arrangements;
            and 3) the MDA to strengthen its continuing role as a
            facilitator of municipal investment.
