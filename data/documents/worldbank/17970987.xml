The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the&#13;
World Bank's fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh&#13;
Kapur, The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings&#13;
Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic&#13;
overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the&#13;
planned publication itself and the sources that should be con~ulted; at other times they&#13;
talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes&#13;
and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group&#13;
Archives believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it&#13;
available for public use.&#13;

&#13;
LEWIS: You were a key player in the reorganization, and maybe most of all we&#13;
need to get some guidance from you on what we do about your new part of the world.&#13;
It's all blown up since we started this history. Richard, why don't you start off on the&#13;
Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Okay. I didn't know anything about the Philippines, but I went there with&#13;
Devesh a couple months ago. In just sort of a first blush impression, talking to the&#13;
people there and here, one sees quite a cycle in the Bank's relationship with the&#13;
Philippines and the-coming on strong with [Ferdinand E.] Marcos after the '50s and&#13;
'60s when the Bank rather delayed in going in. And I think you arrived there, or at&#13;
least in a big way, sort of at the peak of the Bank, the growth in the Bank's support for&#13;
the Philippines, and you were there until the end of the decade. Like so many other&#13;
places, there were problems developing in '79, '80, '81, industrial strategy reports, the&#13;
first SALs [structural adjustment loans]. In this whole sense--there are a number of&#13;
questions. One is how much U.S. involvement did you see in the whole scene there,&#13;
in the Bank's response to Marcos and then at the end of the decade. This is all&#13;
before-you sort of went out long before it came ...&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, maybe the simplest thing is to try and put things in context a&#13;
little bit, and obviously this is a somewhat personal view of the economic and&#13;
political history of the Philippines and the environment in which we were operating.&#13;
&#13;
I started working on the Philippines at the beginning of the '70s. I guess I first went&#13;
there in '71, '72 or something. This was before martial law was imposed. The-it&#13;
was a very brief economic history, as you know very well, probably better than I--&#13;
they did exceedingly well, in fact, over all the East Asian countries from the start of&#13;
the 1950s, very high growth rates, biggest industrial base in Asia outside of Japan. By&#13;
the end of the '50s, like a lot of the import-substitution driven economies, it started to&#13;
run out of steam. In the beginning of the '60s they started the reform process. In the&#13;
early '60s--they made a fairly major attempt in 1962, ifl recall correctly, a first effort,&#13;
but it was very partial.&#13;
&#13;
And the entire history of the Philippines, in my view, over the following 20 years at&#13;
least--I have to confess I haven't followed it much in the last five years or more, and&#13;
here I would contrast it to, say, Indonesia--but the history of the Philippines was one&#13;
in which they stop-start the coach, a regular cycle ofbalance of payments crises that&#13;
had to do with domestic politics and [inaudible] and very impartial efforts to reform,&#13;
starting basically in 1962. In the easy [inaudible] basically unable to make a&#13;
transition that Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia in the last ten years or&#13;
so, unable to make the transition to a much more output-oriented set of policies. And&#13;
there are all sorts of interesting political reasons for that.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank in the face of this and a whole bunch of other things took a fairly reserved&#13;
view ofthe situation in the 1960s. The major crisis at the end of the '60s, '69 I think&#13;
it was, ifl remember, with the campaign and Marcos re-election, and the Bank started&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          3&#13;
&#13;
to come back in in a fairly big way in the early '70s. The fundamental economic story&#13;
hadn't changed at that time except they'd brought in sort of the technocrats, kind of&#13;
[inaudible} immediately after the elections. So you had the [Cesar E.} Viratas and the&#13;
[Gerardo P.} Sicats and all these people started coming in, with a bit of help from&#13;
outside, you might say. McNamara went out there and read out the riot act and used&#13;
all sort of [inaudible} things about it and forced Marcos, whether he really wanted to&#13;
or not, to bring some of these people into government to try and improve the&#13;
economic situation at least in [inaudible} economic policy.&#13;
&#13;
Then we had martial law. The first three or four years of martial law there had been&#13;
Bank influence which was rather strong, for the period in which there was, in a&#13;
manner of speaking, the first sustained and fairly comprehensive approach to&#13;
economic reform. For one simple example, in the entire period ofthe 1960s there was&#13;
not a single piece of legislation passed in the Congress with respect to taxation--not&#13;
one in ten years. Every time-there were plenty of bills that were sent up, and they&#13;
got knocked down every time. Between September of 1972 when martial law was&#13;
declared and approximately the year-my memory's a little rusty--a year or two later,&#13;
there were approximately 1,000 decrees issued that had revenue implications of one&#13;
kind qr another for the government. Now, I had a hand in writing some of those.&#13;
There was a tremendous outpouring of, in effect, legislation in the form of decrees&#13;
that began to rewrite some of the ground rules. Some of it was fairly spectacular;&#13;
some of it's mundane. And you'd begin to see in the economic statistics for the first&#13;
time in 10 or 15 years tax revenues, for example, started to creep up instead of&#13;
being-I've forgotten the numbers now; 5 percent of GNP or whatever the hell they&#13;
were-started to be going up a bit.&#13;
&#13;
There were a number of other things that were begun to be put in place in that period&#13;
of two or three or four years that began to make the Philippines look a bit more like&#13;
some of the other countries at some stage, that some of the pieces were formed and&#13;
put in place. So Marcos in this period had given his technocrats a fairly free hand,&#13;
and we were pretty active along with others in sort of helping out.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You were an advisor to the government? Is that it?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, I was-it was two things. I was leading the economic missions&#13;
at the time, up to 1974. And then I went out there-took a leave of absence from the&#13;
Bank and went out there as the project manager for a regional planning exercise, and I&#13;
was an advisor in NEDA [National Economic and Development Authority}, the new&#13;
economic planning team, did a few other things as well on the side.&#13;
&#13;
This period of reform where the technocrats had a fair amount of latitude didn't last&#13;
very long. It started to run out of steam around about 1975, 1976, crudely speaking.&#13;
One of the reasons it started to run out of steam, in my view, at least, was that-to go&#13;
back in time a little bit--if you read some of the books that Marcos published,&#13;
including some of the little paperbacks that he published in the late '60s, with the&#13;
benefit of hindsight, reading them in 1976 or 1977, you can see there with the benefit&#13;
of hindsight already some of the elements of what happened subsequently. And my&#13;
own sort of highly sort of a personal view of that period of economic history and&#13;
politics in the Philippines was that Mr. Marcos had a pretty clear political game plan,&#13;
and you can find it in some of his writings in the 1960s. But basically, in a highly&#13;
&#13;
                              Russell J. Cheetham&#13;
                           February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           4&#13;
&#13;
simplified way, it was something on the rise. It played a part in--Marcos wanted to&#13;
break up the power of the local political bosses, much of it rooted in the sort of feudal&#13;
system that existed in parts of the country, and to bring industry and, you know,&#13;
growth and so on and so forth, the price of sugar in Luzon [inaudible} all these local&#13;
sort of power bases and basically try to break that up and essentially replace that sort&#13;
of system with a two or three party system so with one party you really don't ...&#13;
&#13;
Marcos's political party never had a nationwide power base like the other political&#13;
parties at the time. I mean, it's sort of a game of trading off local political bosses,&#13;
each with their own separate power base, to support this party or that party, and&#13;
everybody changing parties all the time each election. His game plan essentially was&#13;
to break that kind of system and replace it with more of a grassroots support for a&#13;
nationwide party. And my own view of what was expected to happen was that to&#13;
make the transition from martial law, essentially supported by the military, by&#13;
business interests and the technocrats, which was crucial for four or five years, but to&#13;
move into something close to--not a one party state, but certainly a system in which&#13;
one party was pretty strong.&#13;
&#13;
Now, as the forerunner for that, the constitution was rewritten to have a prime&#13;
minister and a different political arrangement. The prime minister was going to be the&#13;
leader of that party.&#13;
&#13;
The problem was that Marcos failed to break that local power base. It didn't happen.&#13;
And because it didn't happen, he was unable to build that party, and by the mid-'70s&#13;
the legitimacy of his martial law arrangements was beginning to run out of steam. He&#13;
didn't have an alternative political process to put into place, so he started running out&#13;
of credibility. And unlike Suharto in Indonesia, to stay in power Marcos ..&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Marcos more and more turned to the use of patronage--as most of&#13;
these East Asian systems are accustomed to--concentrating patronage increasingly on&#13;
a relatively small proportion of the population, so there was a sort of shrinking of the&#13;
base that benefited from patronage.&#13;
&#13;
Just as an aside, what's tended to happen in Indonesia, which also uses patronage on&#13;
the [inaudible} system of East Asia, what Suharto has tended to do is broaden the&#13;
base of those who benefit from patronage, access to economic opportunity, and it's&#13;
become, in Indonesia, a kind of a very much of a pluralistic sort of system with many,&#13;
many players.&#13;
&#13;
In the Philippines it tended to shrink. And so you've got sort of increasing alienation&#13;
among these different groups, the base of patronage tending to shrink and be more&#13;
and more concentrated among the military part of the system, and so the--his ability&#13;
then to maintain support for a military, for a martial law regime when this sort of this&#13;
other political game plan didn't work, started increasingly--it came into question. And&#13;
it came into question, and the ability then to conduct economic policy started to fall&#13;
back.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Russell J. Cheetham&#13;
                           February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
That was the environment in which the Bank was operating. The sort of cycle that we&#13;
went through, I think, was a period of three or four years where we had great&#13;
influence, actually helped accomplish quite a lot, '72, '75, sort of into '76. By this&#13;
time the political arrangements were beginning to sort of fall apart, and the ability of&#13;
people like Virata and Sicat--Sicat [inaudible]--but the ability of these people to keep&#13;
pushing ahead with political reform increasingly was compromised. [both speaking at&#13;
once].&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Compare this to ...&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: The Bank-1 mean, just to finish the thought-! mean, 1--my own&#13;
view is that the Bank tended to make political judgments about what was going on. I&#13;
think that was exceedingly naive. I don't think the Bank really understood some of&#13;
these forces. It did not understand that people like, say, the Viratas and others were&#13;
beginning to lose their ability to carry economic reform out. Why? Because the sort&#13;
of the underlying political base in which that could be driven ahead was increasingly&#13;
in question now, by '79, '80, '81.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I was just going to ask about the two teams of technocrats in Indonesia and .&#13;
the Philippines. Were Virata and Sicat and company in terms of sort of intrinsic&#13;
competence in the same league with the Indonesian group, or were the differences&#13;
more that because, as you say, they--the one had support from the top and the other&#13;
lost it?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, if one makes a distinction between sort ofthe technical&#13;
competence and understanding of those people, there's not much to choose. A bunch&#13;
of very competent people in the Philippines who understood full well the policy&#13;
options and why things ought to be done. The big difference is the political&#13;
environment.&#13;
&#13;
General Suharto, whatever his shortcomings may be, I think understands very well&#13;
that he led--the vast nation needs to keep on raising standards of living for a large&#13;
number of people for the political system to have legitimacy and to continue. He&#13;
understands that very well, and in that sense he's the chief economic architect of&#13;
Indonesia. And so when it comes to a crunch--and I've seen them; I have a fair&#13;
amount of rather close personal knowledge oflndonesia for some time--when it&#13;
comes to the crunch, the technocrats have won most times, not every time but most&#13;
times. And so you get into some, I mean, very specific illustrations of this sort of&#13;
thing.&#13;
&#13;
In the early '80s there was the need to adjust energy prices for good and sound&#13;
economic reasons by a pretty large number. The Cabinet discussion was essentially&#13;
was like this, I mean, involved a whole lot of people, and [Nitisastro] Widjojo,&#13;
making the case for a 15 or 20 percent increase in energy prices, and [Admiral]&#13;
Sudomo, the head of security at the time, saying to Suharto, "You can't do it. If you&#13;
do, there will be people on the streets, and I cannot guarantee the security of country."&#13;
Suharto listened, and they raised energy prices 15 percent. It had nothing to do with&#13;
the people living on the street; it had to do with the economic interests of the military.&#13;
I mean, that was--you know, time and time again Suharto would rule in favor of&#13;
economic technocrats. It hasn't happened every time, but it's happened most times.&#13;
&#13;
                              Russell J. Cheetham&#13;
                           February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  That didn't happen in the Philippines. Over time Marcos backed away because of the&#13;
. peculiar sort of power base that he ended up giving himself huge {inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And later been increased--senior management at the Bank, sort of internal&#13;
memos, said that Marcos is totally in power and sort implying that we should back&#13;
him. If one sees the Bank sort of a political establishment, that seems to fall, an&#13;
essential ingredient in the Bank-country relationships, especially {inaudible] at the&#13;
time, how do you see this evolving institution, in a sense of, you know, how savvy has&#13;
the Bank been in the Philippines and a number of other [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, I know I have a prejudice, and the prejudice is basically that&#13;
we employ a large number of bureaucrats who by and large are politically fairly&#13;
naive. It's true in every country, not just in the Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: John and I were just thinking this morning how much the Bank's&#13;
relationship with countries and the way it gets draw in, what it does, is more than a&#13;
Bank/country relationship. It's a Bank/good-guys-in-the-country relationship.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Sure. We're in the business, by and large, of supporting reformers.&#13;
Now that may in some countries constitute a very large segment of the government&#13;
and is not all that big a deal. In other countries it may be a very small segment of the&#13;
government, and the interplay between various people and the rest ofthe,govemment&#13;
can be very complicated. If we're supporting the reformers and they happen to&#13;
constitute a very large proportion of the political and economic forces within the&#13;
country, then in a sense it's fairly straightforward. But when it's not the dominant&#13;
force, I guess my thesis is that we don't understand a very dynamic tum of events, and&#13;
in some cases I suspect we understand very poorly because we tend to concentrate&#13;
only on those people that we need as the immediate interlocutors. So }f there is a lot&#13;
of tension between a segment of the political and economic power base in a country,&#13;
the reformers, and there's a lot of tension between those arid, say, the military, we&#13;
don't want to talk to the military. We are [inaudible] lfwe know anything at all, it's&#13;
what we read in the newspapers.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is there a doctrine against the-talking to the military?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Not a doctrine.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: When you were in Indonesia you didn't feel [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: I had some contact with the military, yeah. But, you know, it's easy&#13;
for pretty senior people. And, of course, we had a diff~rent story.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But it is in all the cases you have to go through the government of&#13;
Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, they are the government oflndonesia. So you pick up the&#13;
phone and say, you know, "May I come and see you, general so-and-so?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Russell J. Cheetham&#13;
                           February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Your sort of counterpart, I suppose, is usually the finance ministry, but you&#13;
didn't feel that you had in any sense to route your messages through finance as you&#13;
talked to other places?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, I mean, you know, it's sort of a complicated business. I mean,&#13;
you obviously [inaudible] You have--even among the reformers there is a&#13;
complicated little dance that goes on. In a gross simplification, you have among the&#13;
reformers you, say, I mean have the reformers in control of financing and, say,&#13;
planning agencies or whatever you-they have different shades in different countries-&#13;
-and budget bureaus and central government, central banks, the guys whose job it is in&#13;
life is to try and keep some restraint on the use of resources. Then you have the&#13;
reform element in the line ministries whose job in life it is to spend money to get&#13;
things done. And of course there's always tension even though they're all part of the&#13;
reform camp. And we, you know, we play up and down that spectrum sometimes.&#13;
We would support the spenders against the center and sometimes the center against&#13;
the spenders or both at the same time, et cetera, et cetera. And that's one little sort of&#13;
sideshow that's going on.&#13;
&#13;
Now except that, apart from that sort of stuff, the.n there were all sorts of other&#13;
elements in this, of where these people in general stand vis-a-vis other important&#13;
power bases in these societies. And it's that part that we tend not to understand so&#13;
well. I would say most Bank staff have a fairly keen appreciation for the interplay&#13;
generally among the people we deal with all the time, they are our lending and the&#13;
economic deploying and so on. We understand less well the interplay between that&#13;
group and other important forces. We did not understand it well at all in the&#13;
Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible] sort of razzle-dazzle in the '78 annual meeting in Manila when&#13;
the markets made out a spread. Did that sort of ...&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: '76.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: '76. What difference did that sort of make-did people see that all the&#13;
[International Monetary Fund] Fund damage?                              Â·&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: I'm sure a lot of people got taken in, yes. I was living there at the&#13;
time. It was quite interesting.&#13;
&#13;
But, yeah, I mean this is an interesting question to pose, I mean, how good are we at&#13;
bringing in these sort of political pressures in these societies. Well, my answer to that&#13;
is, with respect to the reform part of the thing, pretty good. We deal with these guys&#13;
every day and lend them a lot of money and dialogue every day kind of thing.&#13;
Outside ofthat, not so good; in some cases, pretty bad. But what conclusion do you&#13;
draw from that? Do you say, "Well, somehow or another we ought to learn more&#13;
about these things as they're talking to all these other people." It's not so easy.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And that's also become much more important in the '80s as the Bank has&#13;
started to do those sorts of things where this becomes even more important to sustain&#13;
what's lent.&#13;

                           February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Now, let me ask you a question that sort of probes that distinction. I&#13;
have-not just since we're been on this project-been telling myself stories and other&#13;
people stories for years that in the 1970s you got this sort of paradox political&#13;
development in the Bank, that it was locked into using project loans which were&#13;
dandy for doing projects but which were not very good vehicles for policy. And it&#13;
was developing this big head of steam of policy know-how, and Ernie [Ernest] Stem&#13;
was going crazy, and then--manna from heaven!--you get a second oil crisis and quick&#13;
money, and you invent the SAL, and away we go. Now, as I hear you talk about the&#13;
Philippines, you were doing policy advising and were talking with Cesar Virata and&#13;
Sicat and so on. Did you feel the lack of proper vehicles?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: No.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Not in that context. We would have done the same thing and&#13;
accomplished the same things with or without that new instrument. I wouldn't want to&#13;
generalize and say that that's not a useful instrument in, at least in some situations. I&#13;
don't think it would have made much difference in the Philippines. There was a&#13;
period in time when the technocrats had a fair amount of latitude in pushing ahead&#13;
with reform, and whether we loaned this way or that way or any other way wouldn't&#13;
have made much difference. I mean, that agenda was being pursued at about as fast&#13;
as you could reasonably pursue in the political context of the time. As fast as we&#13;
could sit there and write decrees and get the goddamn things signed and ramming&#13;
them down the throats of some of those line ministries and other people . . .       Â·&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That was an unusual situation.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Yeah. It didn't last, you know. Lending instruments wouldn't have&#13;
made much difference. Then for rather peculiar reasons in the Philippines and the&#13;
[inaudible] it wouldn't have made a whole lot of difference later on, either, because&#13;
the political support just wasn't there for sustained reform.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: At the very beginning of the Bank's enthusiasm there was quite a change,&#13;
wasn't there? You talk about a crisis in '69, '70, and then in '71-'72 you had the&#13;
martial--! think the Bank was already going strong before martial law. Or did that&#13;
make much difference?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Going strong in what sense?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, a significant increase in support in the '60s ...&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: In lending?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. No?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: It started' happening after '72. Look at the lending commitment&#13;
levels. My recollection is a little hazy, but I think you'll find that loan commitments&#13;
were running at about, through the '60s and up into the very early '70s, probably no&#13;
more than-you know, for a while a long run--50 or 60 million dollars a year and then&#13;
&#13;
                              Russell J. Cheetham&#13;
                           February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
it had gone up a bit was over 100 million or something like that-I'm a little bit rusty.&#13;
Then from about '72, '73, '74, we took it up to 200 or 300 million a year. And that&#13;
increase was not planned in the sense that in 1970 and 1971 we made the decision we&#13;
were going to take it up to several hundred million a year. It only began to happen&#13;
after martial law.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And what was the relationship that you see between the law and ...&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, we were operating in an environment where there were a lot of,&#13;
a sort of a backlog of policy reform measures that had not been attended to in the '60s&#13;
began to get attention. The first decree that was signed was the reorganization of the&#13;
Philippine government (it never got fully implemented); the second decree that was&#13;
signed was the reform decree, it got signed on the second day of martial law. And&#13;
then within a year there were dozens and dozens and dozens of decrees on tax policy&#13;
and tax reform that began to have an impact on collections for the first time in 15&#13;
years. A lot of other things that began to happen, restructuring of some public&#13;
enterprises, we began to do serious work on what to do in the steel industry, serious&#13;
work on the energy sector for the first time [inaudible] So but the environment was&#13;
one in which there was a lot of reason to think that things were beginning to turn&#13;
around. Â·&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Was the economic team-it was mostly there before martial law.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Just before.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Just before.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Yes. They were put in place-it varied a bit--they came in at&#13;
different times, but I guess 1970-71, essentially.&#13;
&#13;
But there was always already tension before martial law in-I mean, you've probably&#13;
told been this story already--when McNamara was out there in 1972, and there was a&#13;
lot of, all sorts of-the elections were coming again, and [Benigno S., Jr.] Aquino&#13;
was the likely candidate. And I can remember going to have lunch with Aquino-this&#13;
is before martial law-at the Congressional building with some of his cronies. And&#13;
we had a fascinating lunch, talking about what's going to happen if he became&#13;
president because it looked-! mean, there was a pretty good chance that he was&#13;
going to win that next election. They had the technocrats trying to sort of push ahead&#13;
with reforms pre-martial law, having a bit of trouble, as well as the things that they&#13;
were doing that weren't terribly popular.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara went out there for a visit to read the riot act to Marcos. And there was this&#13;
lunch with, you know, Marcos and Mrs. Marcos. Mrs. Marcos at one point in the&#13;
lunch-this was with Virata and Sicat--she pointed to Marcos and said to the old man,&#13;
"You know why you're losing the local election here in Manila." They'd done badly&#13;
in Manila. "I can tell you. It's very simple. It's because ofthese people over here.&#13;
They're making a mess of this place," and she, I mean, in a loud, aggressive tone, sort&#13;
of said in front of McNamara about Virata and Sicat [inaudible] McNamara was&#13;
appalled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Russell J. Cheetham&#13;
                           February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    10&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was appalled that the first lady had this kind of influence?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Probably. I remember saying a year or two later, after I had become&#13;
very ~lose to some of these people, saying to Alex Malchoa [ph.], who was the sort of&#13;
secretary so-called to the president, that Mrs. Marcos was in the habit of calling&#13;
cabinet meetings--although she didn't have a cabinet position-had a habit of calling&#13;
cabinet meetings. I said to Alex one day, "What happens if she happens to call a&#13;
meeting at the same time the old man calls a meeting?" I said it as a bit of a joke.&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Oh, don't laugh. It happened."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Really?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Oh, yes." He said, "But I'll tell you, we all got together and we decided&#13;
who'd go to which meeting." [laughter] He said, "We got it divided up." That was&#13;
back in the '60s. Of course she went on ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did you think--who put him up to this, himself to the martial law decision,&#13;
or she [inaudible] put him up?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, I don't know, purely personally I believe [inaudible] his game&#13;
plan. I mean, she was power hungry and all the rest of it but not a serious player at&#13;
that time.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In all this, the sort of U.S. role was muted, nonexistent ...&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, I don't know. Ifyou're talking about formulation of economic&#13;
policies, not serious.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You know in getting the Bank to support, more enthusiastic ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Especially in [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, I didn't have a whole lot to do with the Philippines in the early&#13;
'80s. I kept going out there towards the end of the '70s, more in a personal capacity.&#13;
I'd come back and joined EPDS [Economic Analysis and Projections Department]&#13;
and been doing other things, but I used to go back a couple of times a year and advise&#13;
some of the cabinet members a bit on this or that. I had sort of an informal&#13;
arrangement with the country department to keep doing that, go out and sort of doing&#13;
it in a non-threatening way. But I stopped doing that around about '79, and I didn't&#13;
follow things all that closely.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did Cesar Virata's being made chairman of the development committee&#13;
have any significance?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Within ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I mean, was a sign of the Bank's support somehow or ...&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Within the Philippines I wouldn't give that (inaudible]&#13;
&#13;

                          February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He was made prime minister, not until '81 or something like that?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: '81 or '82?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: I'm not sure-my memory is a little rusty on that--but I would guess&#13;
it was around the beginning of the '80s.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And you--along with a meeting, your book was published in '76. It wasn't&#13;
the first such book, was it?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: That the Bank did?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, on a country.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: No, there had been others, I mean, going back a long way, actually.&#13;
They used to do those hard cover things, I mean, years and years ago [both speaking&#13;
at once] many years ago.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible1 report.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, that's right.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Back into the middle '50s, I guess. I can't recall when those things&#13;
started. A fairly long history.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: How do you see the value of that book?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: That particular book?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Pretty minimal. Of historical interest, perhaps, but the impact on&#13;
policymaking--by the time that thing came out, as I explained earlier, things were&#13;
already beginning to unravel. It was already-! mean, in the period when I was living&#13;
out there for approximately two years it was already getting more and more difficult&#13;
to get good policy decisions and to make them stick. Alex Malchoa [sp1 was&#13;
somewhere [inaudible1 The power base of the technocrats and the cohesion in that&#13;
military-commercial-technocratic three-legged stool that essentially supported martial&#13;
law was beginning to unravel in part because of the way patronage was being used&#13;
and so, instead of these three interest groups all sort of coalescing in some fashion,&#13;
began to sort of divide.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What were the three groups, again? Military ...&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Military, commercial, and business interests and technocratic. Now,&#13;
the commercial interests-! mean, you know about that in the Philippines-is a&#13;
particular kind. Those people who got control of the business sector, manufacturing&#13;
and commerce and so on, are a limited number of very important families and by and&#13;
large they all came from the land. These were the families of the landed aristocrats.&#13;
&#13;
                             Russell J. Cheetham&#13;
                          February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         12&#13;
&#13;
When the industrialization process got started in the 1950s they moved off the land.&#13;
And through this system of economic regulation and control of licensing, they're the&#13;
ones that had the resources to sort of capture that process. And so you had the Ayalas&#13;
and all of these families moving in off the land, getting control of the industrialization&#13;
process with the enormous amount of rent-seeking and profiteering that went with it.&#13;
And so you have your 20 or 30 or 40 families that have a rural agricultural base,&#13;
moved in and got control of the industrial system, and they stayed in control of it.&#13;
And that's Mrs. [Corazon C.] Aquino's problem today. It's still the same 20, 25, and&#13;
behavior hasn't changed.&#13;
&#13;
The big problem now--and I'm shooting from the hip again--but a lot of these families&#13;
over time have (again, a little bit unlike Indonesia) many of those families in the&#13;
meantime have built up enormous asset bases overseas.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: These are the built-in, right?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Yes. And so, you know, in the last 10 or 15 years, you tried to&#13;
impose significant changes in economic policy and expect these families to adjust&#13;
their economic behavior when they're sitting there on an enormous asset base&#13;
overseas, they may or may not change their [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: A quickie question along, a little bit along--do you think that the Bank had&#13;
a chance and missed it to strengthen Mrs. Aquino's hand to go for serious land&#13;
reform?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: While she could still do it by decree? I'm pretty skeptical.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Are you?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: We gave it a good shot in 1972, '73, and I think that circumstances&#13;
were as good then and the conditions were as good then as subsequent. We did an&#13;
enormous amount of work on land reform in '72, '73, but those local power bases are&#13;
strong. It's very difficult.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: When you say you did a lot of work, did the, was the institution, the&#13;
headquarters here, engaged in that side of it?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Yes, basically, the sort of things we did--the government wanted us&#13;
to do a lot oflending, and we ultimately didn't do it. In fact, the present secretary of&#13;
finance in those days was the head of the land bank, who was sort of to spearhead a&#13;
land reform program. He was a good guy. He came, had originally come from the&#13;
central bank and Cesarr Virata removed him from the central bank and put him in&#13;
charge of the land bank, and said, "Now I want you to implement land reform."&#13;
Except there's this guy, an agrarian reform minister, who is a bit of a crook,&#13;
[Condrado F.} Estrella, who wasn't so keen about it.&#13;
&#13;
But the work that was done at the time, the management had collected, the&#13;
government collected, had access to reasonably decent information on the number of&#13;
tenants and the patent, the land holding and the sizes and all that sort of stuff, by crop&#13;
type, licensure and co-finance and all that sort of thing. There was a tremendous&#13;
&#13;
                               Russell J. Cheetham&#13;
                            February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       13&#13;
&#13;
amount of detailed work done on how much could be divided up, given the rules of&#13;
the game that they had sort of settled on, how much you could pay and all that sort of&#13;
stuff. A lot of very detailed analysis and calculation was done on the macroeconomic&#13;
impact of monetizing, say, if you want to sort of pay off all of these people these&#13;
millions and millions of dollars in order to make the transfer and what was the&#13;
macroeconomic impact of that on the balance of payments and all that sort of stuff.&#13;
How much of that would inflation [inaudible]? What sort of schemes might be&#13;
developed to reabsorb that injection of cash into the system? And how might we&#13;
redesign some lending instruments? And what sort of agricultural credit programs&#13;
could be put in place to be made available immediately to former tenants and so on?&#13;
And the design of a whole lot of detailed agricultural operations that would support&#13;
the program occurred in about two years, a lot of work, very detailed calculations: the&#13;
cost of the program, the sorts of interventions that could be applied and supported and&#13;
so on. Ultimately it [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But did the Bank [inaudible] to back it up with loans ...&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Not quite explicit. Cesar wanted us to lend 40 or 50 million to&#13;
finance the land transfers. We said no.&#13;
&#13;
But he said, "Okay, then help me figure out how much I've got to inject into the&#13;
economy to finance these transfers, how much is got to be cash and how much could&#13;
be in deferred payments [bot~ speaking at once] and so on, so we minimize the&#13;
[inaudible] impact. And in that context are you prepared to design a series of projects&#13;
that will support the process through agricultural credit and so on?"&#13;
&#13;
And we. said, "Yes."&#13;
&#13;
So we did a lot ofwork designing some other sorts of interventions that would be in&#13;
companion. I've forgotten the numbers now, but they're going to have to spend 200&#13;
million dollars and he's going to sort of pay for 20 or 30 or 50 million dollars of the&#13;
transfer with cash and the rest of it in all these sorts of fancy bond schemes that would&#13;
[inaudible] impact on the capital market.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: McNamara was on for this?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: He was willing to go along with it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Who was the vice president for East Asia then?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: That was Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell, I think.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was it Bernie?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, yes and no. Bernie came back from Indonesia in 1972. He&#13;
had just taken over, I think, when we started in on that. He must have come back&#13;
about the time of martial law; went to Africa for a couple years; then came to East&#13;
Asia, I guess, in '73, '74. [1 Peter M] Cargill was [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Peter was?&#13;
&#13;
                              Russell J. Cheetham&#13;
                           February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Yeah. He was my vice president of the region.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And he was on for this? No! I can't believe it! [laughter]&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: I don't know if we ever talked to him about it. [both speaking at&#13;
once] Ray [Raymond] Goodman was the programs director at the time, and Ray was&#13;
pretty heavily involved in it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is enlightening. I've had the impression that everybody sort of figured&#13;
that land reform wasn't on in ...&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Sorry?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I had the impression that everybody in the Bank sort of figured that land&#13;
reform was a good thing but it wasn't on, politically, at that time. That's what you get&#13;
if you read Redistribution with Growth. There are some people that have, some of the&#13;
authors, who are, seem to be favorably disposed to land reform, but the majority&#13;
views or the [Hollis] Chenery views seem not to be, that, you know, that you couldn't&#13;
do it so we have to look around for other ways to reallocate assets.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: We were up to our eyeballs in it in the Philippines. We weren't&#13;
prepared to finance the transfer.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, that's understandable.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: We were prepared to provide wholesale [inaudible] project to&#13;
support. No question ..&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
{Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: I hired her as a summer research assistant in 1976. Because she&#13;
knew a little about land reform, I said, "I want you to work full time for me as a&#13;
research assistant on land reform." And she spent the first year of her life as a part&#13;
time research assistant.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Shengold?&#13;
&#13;
Â· CHEETHAM: Ellen Shengold. S-H-E-N-G-0-L-D.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And that didn't go because Marcos wouldn't buy it?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Well, the land reform itself didn't proceed on anywhere near the&#13;
scale that we had all calculated. I mean, I had gotten 70,000. We figured that sort of-&#13;
-didn't happen. I mean, the political opposition to these transfers was quite strong.&#13;
And so a lot of these guys that had ten hectares of rice or five hectares of rice . . . It&#13;
didn't happen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              Russell J. Cheetham&#13;
                           February 5, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         15&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So did the proposal that the Bank make some of these reinforcing or&#13;
supporting loans, did that also ..&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: We did some of it but not in support ofland reform. We did some&#13;
agricultural lending and so on because not too long after that [Arturo R., Jr.} Tanco,&#13;
the agriculture secretary, launched this sort of rice intensification program. So we did&#13;
agricultural credit in support of that, and it tended to sort of a mix-it-up with the&#13;
progress of land reform, but in fact my recollection is that it was more public relations&#13;
than substantive in those days.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We've barely gotten past the first of our five subjects! You know what they&#13;
are. We've got to come back and talk to you about Indonesia. Let me just ask: you&#13;
have probably a longer--except for Bernie Bell--the longest and heaviest identification&#13;
with Indonesia of anybody in the Bank, I guess. We all went there as complete&#13;
novices, stayed a week because we figured that-longer than we stayed in the other&#13;
countries but this is a most important relationship--and were totally fascinated. We&#13;
thought all that has been said about the technocrats seems to be true, except there's&#13;
more to tell.&#13;
&#13;
Â·cHEETHAM: How much time do you have?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, we really don't know what to make of, to tell you a bit, that Widjojo-&#13;
these guys had gone on to the Philippines--gave me a great lunch at his house with his&#13;
new wife. My wife came along and a couple of people from the Harvard Group, and&#13;
they had one of these lunches with the conical yellow, you know, things, and Mrs.&#13;
Widjojo served me. And the house is incredible, absolutely outstanding. There are&#13;
several full-length portraits of your hostess there, and it's just reeking with affluence.&#13;
And at the end it, Widjojo said, "Professor, there's one more reason I wanted to tell&#13;
you why we like the World Bank in here. It's to keep out corruption." Now, what do&#13;
we make of this? I mean, 1his is a terrific system that is awash, it looks like, with&#13;
corruption.&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Yeah, well, I don't know. What do you say about it?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Has it been always that way, sort of?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Yeah. I mean, I've worked in almost all the East Asian countries&#13;
now on and off for fairly long periods of time. Is Indonesia any worse than some of&#13;
the other countries at various points in time? I would say probably not, probably not.&#13;
I mean, you find outstanding examples in every one of the countries I've worked in.&#13;
&#13;
The--there are interesting differences. You know, one of the things--it's not a&#13;
comment on what one sees in an individual house. I mean, there are certainly very&#13;
opulent houses in Jakarta as there are in Korea in the '70s and the Philippines and so&#13;
on and so forth, Thailand. You find them in every one ofthese societies.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What do you do with that kind of thing? I don't know. It's corruption, in a sense ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Has it been a difficult, agonizing problem for the Bank, I mean, or does the&#13;
Bank really just kind of walk above the, that kind of problem?&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: It hasn't been the problem. We over the years--and I do not want to&#13;
give the impression that Bank projects have been immune to abuse--but by and large I&#13;
thiqk we have managed to establish a ..&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: I think we have managed to establish, by and large, a reputation for&#13;
not countenancing this sort of thing. I mean, we have the procedures to try and&#13;
safeguard our souls and [inaudible] clients and that sort of thing, and it's not ...&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: It's not to say that there haven't been problems. I know there have,&#13;
but ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [both speaking at once] I had the impression that you had a little bit more .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: Are you talking about the Bank operations now, or in general?&#13;

KAPUR: No, the Bank in Indonesia. There's a family role in the [inaudible]&#13;
corruption. The family [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
CHEETHAM: I don't know. I mean, there's a lot of stuffin the popular press, and&#13;
there are certainly--they've had a pretty high profile in some industrial projects and&#13;
some [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
There have been some problems in some Bank projects that I'm aware of. Some of&#13;
the more, the better ones, better known ones are [inaudible] ones we've actually&#13;
loans, but where we've done work. A few that I can think of, we--the main problem&#13;
that we had dealt with [inaudible] in execution.&#13;
&#13;
But I mean there's been a peripheral sort of a bit of exchange with this toll road thing&#13;
where we've taken a stand on policies on toll roads. We haven't actually [inaudible]&#13;
When I came, we'd not actually done lending in this area, we're basically not&#13;
[inaudible] but it's being done.&#13;
