LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:               Russian Federation&#13;
Implementing Agency:    Medical Equipment Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU)&#13;
Beneficiaries:         Primary and secondary health care facilities in 34 selected oblasts&#13;
Poverty Category:      The project is not part of the Program of Targeted Interventions as its&#13;
benefits are spread broadly among the population as a whole. However, the&#13;
project would contribute to the preservation of universal access to basic&#13;
social services which is an essential element in any safety net.&#13;
Amount:                 US$270 million&#13;
Terms:                 Payable in seventeen years, including five years of grace, at the standard&#13;
interest rate for LIBOR-based US Dollar single currency loans&#13;
Financial Benefits&#13;
and Risks:             The Government selected the single currency loan option in order to improve&#13;
its overall liability management and reduce its risks. The US Dollar was&#13;
chosen by the Government in order to match expected federal revenues.&#13;
Selection of the LIBOR-based interest rate was justified primarily to preserve&#13;
the standard country repayment terms of 17 years maturity in comparison to&#13;
the shorter final maturity of a fixed rate single currency loan.  The&#13;
Government also stated that it did not have a significant amount of debt&#13;
subject to fluctuating interest rates and would, therefore, be able to manage&#13;
its risk.&#13;
Commitment Fee:        0.75 % on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less&#13;
any waiver&#13;
Onlending Terms:        Not applicable (intergovernmental transfer arrangement; no formal on-lending&#13;
agreements)&#13;
Financing Plan:         See para. 4.7&#13;
Economic Rate of Return:  The ERR for this operation is not quantifiable. See Chapter 6.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1          The Russian Federation is the world's largest country, encompassing 17,075,000 square&#13;
kilometers. With a population of 148 million, it is also the sixth most populous. Living circumstances&#13;
vary from compact industrial regions with established social infrastructure to production centers set in&#13;
vast sparsely populated regions and agricultural areas in rural settings. There is great ethnic and cultural&#13;
diversity. Ecological problems, varying only in source and severity, are present throughout the country.&#13;
Shortcomings in Russia's health care system, combined with the effects of economic and social stresses,&#13;
have caused serious deterioration in health status. This trend became apparent even before the dissolution&#13;
of the USSR in 1991.&#13;
1.2          The Soviet health system was at one time considered a model for other countries to&#13;
emulate. It was, and still is, characterized by universal and relatively equitable access to a comprehensive&#13;
system of health care. In principle, the system emphasized primary and preventive care and was built&#13;
around a network of primary health care centers comprising feldsher stations, women's consultations,&#13;
polyclinics and ambulatories, accessible to the population throughout the vast territory of the Soviet&#13;
Union.&#13;
1.3          Russia has inherited the Soviet health system, but, with the financial strains of the&#13;
economic transition, the disparities between the theoretical design of the system and the way it works in&#13;
practice become glaringly apparent. Despite artificially controlled prices of the various inputs, the system&#13;
was becoming unaffordable even before the economic transition. Now, as prices of non-salary inputs&#13;
have been liberalized and the responsibility for financing has been decentralized, resource constraints have&#13;
become an even more important factor. Health care spending has become heavily skewed toward curative&#13;
and in-patient care. Although salaries of medical personnel are low in comparison to other professions,&#13;
salaries are given the first priority in allocating the limited resources available. It is clear that universal&#13;
comprehensive health care cannot be provided by the system in its present configuration at the current&#13;
levels of financing. However, even within the envelope of resources currently available, the relevance&#13;
and quality of health care provided can be improved.&#13;
1.4          In order to strike a balance between the needs of the population for health care and the&#13;
resources available, comprehensive reform of the Russian health care system will be required. As in&#13;
other countries, the reforms will involve improving financial incentives to providers to raise quality and&#13;
cost efficiency, restructuring health care delivery through both physical restructuring of facilities and&#13;
implementation of effective clinical protocols, providing more services on an out-patient basis and&#13;
reducing reliance on hospitalization. A shift in the balance between public and private sector involvement&#13;
of both the financing and provision of health care is needed. This is an extensive agenda which will&#13;
require many years to complete. The proposed project represents an initial step towards restructuring&#13;
and rationalizing health care facilities in Russia.&#13;
&#13;

A. HEALTH STATUS&#13;
Life Expectancy&#13;
1.5          In certain respects, the health issues confronting the Russian population are similar to&#13;
those found in other industrialized countries. Like other countries which have progressed through the&#13;
epidemiological transition, the major health problems are related to chronic, non-infectious diseases.&#13;
However, in sharp contrast with patterns in almost all developed and developing countries, the health&#13;
status of the Russian population is worsening. This deterioration is perhaps most visibly reflected in the&#13;
alarming trend in life expectancy.&#13;
1.6           From 1990 to 1993, life expectancy for men declined from 63.8 years to 58.9 years and&#13;
for women from 74.3 years to 71.9 years. In 1993 alone, male life expectancy declined by three years&#13;
and female life expectancy by two years. Such dramatic declines are unprecedented except in times of&#13;
war or natural disaster. The trend continued downward in 1994 to 58.2 years for men and 71.6 for&#13;
women. In the early 1950s, health status and life expectancy in Russia were roughly comparable to the&#13;
rest of Europe. Until the mid-1960s, health gains equalled or exceeded the rest of Europe. However,&#13;
from that point onward, life expectancy stagnated until the 1990s and then actually declined. The 13-year&#13;
gap between male and female life expectancy, the largest anywhere in the world, is largely attributable&#13;
to certain lifestyle choices, e.g., consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Men are two and a half times as&#13;
likely as women to diz at an economically productive age.&#13;
Table 1.1: Life Expectancy at Birth (in years)&#13;
1965     1980     1990      1991      1992     1993      1994&#13;
Men                64.3     61.5      63.9      63.5      62.0     58.9      58.2&#13;
Women              73.4    73.1       74.4      74.3      73.8     71.9      71.6&#13;
Adult Health&#13;
1.7          In 1993, the leading causes of death in Russia were cardiovascular disease (52 percent),&#13;
trauma and poisoning (16 percent) and cancer (13 percent). Infectious diseases accounted for only about&#13;
1 percent of deaths. Over the past 30 years, mortality from infectious diseases has fallen steadily, while&#13;
deaths from cardiovascular disease have nearly doubled. This pattern differs markedly from that in&#13;
westem Europe, Japan and North America, where mortality rates from cardiovascular disease declined&#13;
by 35 to 50 percent during the same period. More recently, there has also been a dramatic increase in&#13;
deaths due to trauma and poisoning. In 1992, the single most significant cause of death in this category,&#13;
responsible for 18 percent of such deaths, was suicide. Another 13 percent were murders and a further&#13;
10 percent were due to alcohol poisoning. This pattern strongly suggests inadequacies in the provision&#13;
of mental health services, despite the fact that nearly 5 percent of the total population received some form&#13;
of psychiatric care.&#13;
1.8          Both morbidity and mortality reflect distinct gender patterns. In 1992, for example, the&#13;
incidence of cancer in men was 1.8 times as high as in women, with lung cancer accounting for 30&#13;
percent of all cases. The most common form of cancer in women, accounting for 17 percent of cases,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                       Page 3&#13;
was breast cancer. At comparable ages, men are over twice as likely to die from cancer as women, three&#13;
times as likely to die from respiratory diseases, and five times as likely to die from trauma and poisoning.&#13;
Maternal and Children's Health&#13;
1.9          The declines in life expectancy also reflect a worsening in infant mortality. Infant&#13;
mortality, which dropped from 22.0 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 17.4 in 1990, rose to 19.9 in 1993,&#13;
before declining to 19.0 in 1994. This rate is two to three times as high as in OECD countries.&#13;
Maternal mortality, at 52 per 100,000 live births (1993), is five to ten times as high as in other&#13;
industrialized countries. The main causes are complications from abortions, post-partum bleeding and&#13;
toxemia. Although abortion is legal and is commonly used to control fertility, the recent imposition of&#13;
social and medical criteria to abortions after the first trimester may lead women to seek illegal abortions,&#13;
complications of which contribute greatly to the high rate of maternal mortality.  Contraceptive&#13;
prevalence is low. The official rate for modem methods was 22.8 percent in 1993. Although rates of&#13;
over 40 percent have been reported, these include a high proportion, perhaps as much as half, of non-&#13;
modem methods, e.g., rhythm, withdrawal.&#13;
1.10         The frequency of abortion also contributes to a high prevalence of anemia among women&#13;
of childbearing age which eventually results in high rates of anemia among small children. A recent&#13;
survey found the prevalence of anemia for children under age two at between 10 and 15 percent in major&#13;
cities and at about 25 percent in the surrounding oblasts. Immunization rates ranging from 60 to 80&#13;
percent are fairly comparable to those in other industrialized countries. The availability of vaccines is&#13;
not a major problem in Russia, as, in the past, Russia was the main source of vaccines for all of the&#13;
USSR. Decreases in vaccine production have, however, adversely affected some of the other FSU&#13;
republics, as vaccines are exported only after local demand is met. Children who survive to their first&#13;
birthday are likely to reach adulthood, but then have a one in four chance of dying before age 60.&#13;
Demographic Crisis&#13;
1.11         The convergence of increased mortality and declining birth rates since 1988 has led to&#13;
what Russian health officials speak of as the "demographic crisis." In fact, this issue is highlighted as&#13;
the most significant concern in the 1992 "State Report on the Status of Health of the Population in the&#13;
Russian Federation" (1992 State Report).&#13;

Since 1992, the birth and death rates have interacted to produce a natural decrease in population. The&#13;
effect on the age composition of the population has been a reduction in the population of productive age&#13;
accompanied by an increasing proportion of pensioners.&#13;

Risk Factors&#13;
1.12          The main risk factors in terms of adult health are alcohol, tobacco and diet. Adult&#13;
morbidity and mortality are also adversely affected by unhealthful and often dangerous working&#13;
conditions. Among the republics of the Former Soviet Union (FSU), Russia is second only to Belarus&#13;
in per capita consumption of alcohol. It is estimated that alcohol consumption in Russia rose by 30&#13;
percent during the period 1987 to 1992. Recent surveys indicate a dramatic increase (over 100 percent)&#13;
in the quantity of alcohol consumed by male drinkers during the period September 1992 to December&#13;
1994, while alcohol consumption by female drinkers increased only slightly.&#13;
1.13          Smoking is very prevalent in Russia, with approximately 60 percent of adult men and 15&#13;
percent of adult women smoking. The difference in smokinig prevalence is also a major factor&#13;
contributing to the gender patterns in morbidity and mortality. While male smoking trends have remained&#13;
stable at fairly high levels, the prevalence of smoking among women, particularly young women, is&#13;
increasing and will undoubtedly be reflected in health status in the future.&#13;
1.14          Household surveys reveal a marked change in diet between 1989 and 1992, including&#13;
significant decreases in the consumption of fruits and vegetables, fish, meat and milk and dairy products,&#13;
and sharp increases in the consumption of bread and potatoes. These changes were, in part, beneficial.&#13;
Prior to 1989, fat consumption was 10 to 15 percent higher than the recommended levels, while by 1992&#13;
calories from fat represented 31 percent of daily caloric intake, although a high proportion still comes&#13;
from animal fats. Undernutrition is not a significant problem; however, the prevalence of obesity is high,&#13;
particularly among older women, and contributes to the high incidence of cardiovascular disease.&#13;
1.15          Although 77 percent of urban dwellers and 65 percent of rural dwellers are reported to&#13;
have access to safe water supply, mechanical failures and intermittent shortages of water treatment&#13;
chemicals may reduce the overall level to as low as 50 percent overall on a consistent basis. Industrial&#13;
pollution is also a significant problem, leading to regional variations in respiratory diseases and various&#13;
forms of cancer, although hard data linking causes and effects are not readily available. Similarly, high&#13;
levels of radiation resulting from nuclear accidents require long-term epidemiological monitoring.&#13;
B. ORGANIZATION OF HEALTH CARE&#13;
1.16          The decentralized Russian health care system as it now exists reflects both the positive&#13;
and negative attributes of the highly centralized Soviet health system from which it evolved. On the&#13;
positive side, access is universal and fairly equitable; the system is characterized by an extensive network&#13;
of over 20,000 polyclinics; and costs have been contained. On the negative side, the system is not&#13;
sufficiently funded to support the comprehensive service it attempts to provide'; relies too heavily on&#13;
curative and inpatient care; lacks incentives to encourage efficiency; and neglects health promotion and&#13;
recognition of the individual responsibility for adopting a healthy lifestyle.&#13;
1.17          The public health system in Russia, which provides access to the entire population,&#13;
comprises 12,000 hospitals (including 4,700 community or district hospitals) and maternity homes,&#13;
aggregating 2.8 million in-patient beds, 15,500 polyclinics and women's consultations, and 3,500&#13;
ambulatories. In addition, there are 48 medical academies, 117 research institutes and 34 major&#13;
I At 4 percent of GDP, health spending in Russia is at approximately the level that would be expected for a middle-income&#13;
country. However, it is substantially lower than in OECD countries, which are more appropriate health comparators for Russia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                          Page 5&#13;
diagnostic centers. In parallel, there are some 600 hospitals and 1,700 outpatient clinics operated under&#13;
the auspices of the Ministries of Defense, Interior, and Railways and other ministries and agencies. In&#13;
addition, large enterprises may also operate their own health care facilities for the benefit of their&#13;
employees and (sometimes) families and possibly residents of the inmmediate community. The precise&#13;
number of facilities in this latter group is not known. The latter two groups of facilities are sometimes&#13;
referred to as the "parallel system." Although these are often superior to public facilities because they&#13;
are better financed, in principle, they are redundant as their beneficiaries already have access to sinilar&#13;
services through the public system.&#13;
1.18          The number and capacity of health care facilities is not only adequate, but probably&#13;
excessive. However, quality is an entirely different matter. The 1992 State Report indicates that 23&#13;
percent of hospitals have no running water; 33 percent have no sewerage system; 60 percent do not have&#13;
hot running water; 23 percent of buildings need major repairs; and 2 percent are considered unsafe. The&#13;
state of equipment in health facilities is equally poor. Much of the equipment is run-down, out-of-date,&#13;
or unusable for lack of spare parts. Most facilities make heroic efforts to maintain their equipment, often&#13;
cannibalizing other pieces for spare parts. However, budget shortages for maintenance or new investment&#13;
are chronic and these efforts eventually become futile.&#13;
1.19          Since 1992, provision and financing (see next section) of health care have been&#13;
decentralized to the oblasts. At the oblast level, a typical health care system would comprise a central&#13;
oblast hospital (a tertiary-level general hospital with perhaps 1,000 beds, usually the best equipped,&#13;
staffed and financed facility in the oblast), several specialty hospitals, e.g., pediatric, emergency,&#13;
psychiatric, tuberculosis, one or two maternity homes, several free-standing polyclinics, one of which&#13;
m-night be attached to and serve as the outpatient department for the central oblast hospital. Each raion&#13;
typically has a central raion hospital (200 to 300 beds) with attached polyclinic and possibly a maternity&#13;
home, one or more district hospitals (25 to 50 beds), one or more ambulatories (small polyclinics) and&#13;
numerous feldsher stations (primary health care facilities usually staffed by medical personnel known as&#13;
feldshers, whose level of training falls between that of a nurse and a physician).&#13;
1.20          Although the vast majority of health services are provided by the public system at the&#13;
oblast level and below and the parallel system, there is a thin layer of federally financed health facilities.&#13;
Federal institutions are generally highly specialized health facilities, often associated with research&#13;
institutes, and account for less than 2 percent of inpatient admissions and 1 percent of outpatients treated.&#13;
Health promotion is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry (MOHMI) and the&#13;
recently (1991) split off State Comnmittee on Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance (SCSES). The&#13;
latter has broad public health responsibilities in sanitatiorn, hygiene, epidemiology and some aspects of&#13;
environmental protection.&#13;
1.21          The provision of health care in Russia is characterized by excessive reliance on curative&#13;
and inpatient care. Although, in principle, the MOHMI is responsible for public health, including health&#13;
promotion, the level of funding provided is not commensurate to the task (Table 1.4). Consequently,&#13;
intervention occurs after a disease has been contracted and treatment often involves a protracted period&#13;
of hospitalization. To some extent, medical practice is supply driven by and refites the availability of&#13;
hospital beds and physicians. In recent years, there has been a gradual reduction in the number of&#13;
hospital beds, and in 1992 the MOHMI reduced the intake of new students into medical academies by&#13;
27 percent. Given the large stock of physicians already in the system, it will take considerable time&#13;
before this intervention has a significant impact on the total number of physicians.&#13;

C. HEALTH FINANCING&#13;
1.22           Two of the most positive features of the Russian health care system-universal coverage&#13;
and relatively equitable access-derive from the fact that the system is publicly funded. The major&#13;
sources of health finance are oblast and raion budgets, territorial health insurance funds, federal budget,&#13;
including federal programs implemented by the oblasts, enterprises, households and the Federal&#13;
Mandatory Health Insurance Fund.&#13;
1.23           During the recent period of economic transition, the Goverrnent has made considerable&#13;
efforts to protect social expenditures. While spending on education has declined slightly over the past&#13;
three years, the level of health spending has been better preserved in real terms. Total health&#13;
expenditures have risen from 2.2 percent of GDP in 1990 to 4.0 percent in 1994, but over a period when&#13;
GDP fell by 50 percent and financing requirements have increased. Introduction of the earmarked payroll&#13;
tax for health has been an important factor in maintaining the level of health financing, although the&#13;
declining wage fund has made this financing vulnerable.&#13;
1.24           Until 1992, the sources of health financing were the federal budget, enterprises and de&#13;
minimis household expenditures. Since then, the number and significance of other funding sources has&#13;
expanded, making it difficult to assemble a comprehensive picture of health sector resources. In 1992,&#13;
responsibility for health financing was decentralized to the oblasts. In 1993, a 3.6 percent payroll tax&#13;
for compulsory health insurance was introduced; 1994 was the first full year of implementation. The&#13;
earmarked payroll tax is collected by a territorial health insurance fund at the oblast level which retains&#13;
3.4 percent, and remits 0.2 percent to the Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund which is responsible&#13;
for oversight and providing equalization payments to economically disadvantaged oblasts.&#13;
1.25           As enterprises are privatized, many of them are choosing to shed the responsibility for&#13;
social services they provide. By 1994, enterprise spending on social services was estimated to have&#13;
dropped to less than half the 1992 level. However, most of the parallel system of health facilities are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                       Page 7&#13;
related to government agencies or ministries (e.g., Ministry of Railways) and are not affected by&#13;
privatization. In any case, many of these facilities duplicate those provided by the public system and&#13;
beneficiaries could be served by that system with only a marginal increase in costs.&#13;
1.26         The majority of household spending on health is for outpatient pharmaceuticals, which&#13;
have always been predominantly a self-pay item. Inpatient pharmaceuticals, to the extent they are&#13;
available, are provided to patients free of charge. Outpatient pharmaceuticals purchased under a&#13;
prescription from a physician at a polyclinic or other outpatient facility, are at the patient's expense,&#13;
except for certain categories of patients who receive free or subsidized pharmaceuticals. These include&#13;
diabetics, epileptics, psychotics, veterans, pensioners and very young children. In the past, a high&#13;
proportion of pharmaceuticals was manufactured in Russia and prices were subject to stringent controls.&#13;
Imports, mainly from COMECON (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) countries, were centrally&#13;
purchased and were heavily subsidized by the federal budget.  Hence, the cost of outpatient&#13;
pharmaceuticals, even to those not entitled to direct subsidies, was quite low. As from January 1, 1994,&#13;
all price controls on phannaceuticals have been removed. Most manufacturers have been privatized and&#13;
private distributors and retail outlets have been allowed to enter the market. Because prices at the retail&#13;
level now reflect market forces, prices are much higher than in the past, and affordability has become&#13;
a significant issue, both for individual consumers and inpatient health care facilities. The 1992 State&#13;
Report cites the inadequate supply of pharmaceuticals as a major problem for the health care system.&#13;
Although availability has improved somewhat since then, affordability has become an even larger issue&#13;
(para. 1.29).&#13;
1.27         Although the private practice of medicine is now permitted, relatively little is being spent&#13;
on privately provided health care. The Russian Constitution adopted in December 1993 guarantees free&#13;
health care to all citizens. Current legislation only imprecisely defines the basic package of care.&#13;
However, certain non-essential services, such as cosmetic surgery and, in some places, dental services,&#13;
are provided as "paid services." The combination of privately provided and "paid" publicly provided&#13;
health services probably account for less an 5 percent of total health spending.&#13;
1.28         The allocation of health sector resources is heavily skewed toward hospitals and other&#13;
inpatient facilities. The spending pattern reflects the health care system's emphasis on in-patent care as&#13;
illustrated by the following breakdown of expenditures in 1991.&#13;

Although current national level information is not available, reports from the oblast level indicate that&#13;
the allocation for inpatient care has probably been maintained or even increased.&#13;

1.29         Wages, pharmaceuticals, and food for in-patients are considered "protected" categories&#13;
and cannot be reallocated for other purposes. Even so, since 1990, there has been a significant shift in&#13;
the allocation of health spending by category.&#13;

Total        100    100&#13;
From 1960 through 1991, wages and payroll taxes accounted for 50 percent or more of total health&#13;
expenditures. As noted above (Table 1.3), Russia has a very high proportion of physicians per capita.&#13;
Even though the number of physicians is high, health care administrators are generally unwilling to lay&#13;
off personnel. So, although the number of physicians remains essentially unchanged, salaries have&#13;
continued to be controlled through a system of federal norms managed by the Ministry of Labor, and&#13;
have not risen as rapidly as other costs which have been subject to market forces. In fact, a physician's&#13;
salary at present is equivalent to about 70 percent of the wages earned by an industrial worker. Health&#13;
care administrators fear, with just cause, that the relatively low remuneration of physicians will ultimately&#13;
drive many good doctors out of the profession into other, more lucrative, employment. This is already&#13;
happening with nurses. In 1993, only half of the graduates of nursing schools in Moscow actually took&#13;
up employment as nurses.&#13;
D. REFoRMS&#13;
1.30         Russia adopted a health insurance law, creating the framework for both mandatory and&#13;
voluntary health insurance, in 1991. The mechanism for funding the mandatory health insurance system&#13;
(a 3.6 percent payroll tax paid by employers) was established in December 1992. Actual implementation&#13;
of the new funding mechanism did not get underway until late (September/October) 1993.&#13;
1.31         A major impetus behind the adoption of health insurance legislation was the recognition&#13;
that the hiealth care system was under-funded, and the mandatory health insurance funds were intended&#13;
to supplement budgetary allocations for health finance. A second objective was to separate responsibility&#13;
for financing from the provision of health care to increase the efficiency of the system. There were great&#13;
hopes on the part of its proponents that "insurance medicine," as it was called, would produce major&#13;
improvements in Russian health care. Although the term insurance was used and the legislation called&#13;
for the participation of private insurance companies, the system envisaged was, in essence, a social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                     Page 9&#13;
insurance fund intended to maintain solidarity. Although private insurance companies were to&#13;
intermediate between consumers and health care providers, they were to be not-for-profit firms and could&#13;
not deny coverage based on differentiating risks. In actual fact, the results of the present system have&#13;
been disappointing and many of the original proponents of mandatory health insurance in Russia are ready&#13;
to declare the experiment a failure.&#13;
1.32         Such a conclusion is unjustifiably negative for a number of reasons. First, the health&#13;
insurance legislation was unclear, and thus, allowed for wide variations in its implementation. It contains&#13;
many internal inconsistencies and ambiguities, probably as a result of compromises among the different&#13;
proponents who supported the adoption of different systems (German-like social insurance, Canadian-style&#13;
consumer choice and Israeli-style managed care). Second, because implementation of the health insurance&#13;
system coincided with a major economic decline and decentralization of health financing, instead of&#13;
supplementing the level of resources for health, the earmarked payroll tax merely served to maintain the&#13;
pre-reform level of health spending. However, in 1994, the mandatory health insurance funds accounted&#13;
for 22 percent of health spending. Without them, it is entirely possible that health spending would have&#13;
decreased by this amount. (During the transition period, real expenditures for education have declined&#13;
by 15 percent.) Helping to maintain the level of health spending during the difficult period of economic&#13;
transition has been a significant contribution.&#13;
1.33         In part because of the impossibility of literally implementing the health insurance&#13;
legislation, mandatory health insurance is being implemented differently in various oblasts. In some&#13;
cases, it has served to demonstrate the benefit of separating financing from the provision of health care.&#13;
In others, the territorial health insurance funds function as a shadow oblast health department; financing&#13;
and service provision are still directed by a single agency, but the authority is now vested in the territorial&#13;
health insurance fund. Experiments with provider payment mechanisms have demonstrated that health&#13;
care providers do respond rationally to payment incentives. A system of reimbursing in-patient care on&#13;
the basis of "clinical statistical groups" (somewhat similar to diagnostically related groups or DRGs in&#13;
the U.S.) has been developed and continues to be refined. However, development of appropriate&#13;
mechanisms for reimbursing outpatient care lag behind and the new payment mechanisms sometimes leave&#13;
the ambulatory facilities relatively more disadvantaged than they had been previously.&#13;
1.34         Because the impact of the health insurance system has been disappointing, the Government&#13;
continues to seek new approaches to health financing, also aimed, in part, at reducing the reliance on&#13;
public finance. In parallel with the health insurance reforms, legislation has been adopted which permits&#13;
the private practice of medicine and privatization of distribution and sales of pharmaceuticals. Medical&#13;
equipment maintenance has also been privatized. Although these are positive steps, the development of&#13;
the market response has been constrained by lack of effective demand due to inadequate funding of the&#13;
health system. Nonetheless, a basic framework is in place for gradually increasing the private provision&#13;
of health services and greater private involvement in ancillary and support services. Despite limitations&#13;
in the current system, comprehensive health care is provided to all citizens at a level of funding which&#13;
is both affordable to the economy overall and is relatively efficient in terms of administrative costs.&#13;
There are important opportunities for increasing the cost efficiency, quality and effectiveness of health&#13;
care in Russia. These opportunities could be realized within the existing framework of a publicly funded&#13;
system. It remains for the Government to evaluate the tradeoffs between public and private financing and&#13;
to establish the parameters within which health sector reform in Russia can proceed.&#13;

E. GOVERNmENT'S OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY&#13;
1.35          Inadequate financing of health care facilities (resulting in severe shortages of supplies and&#13;
equipment) and reduction of domestic production capacity for pharmaceuticals and equipment are the&#13;
concerns most frequently cited by sector officials. Therefore, it is not surprising that the major focus of&#13;
health sector reforms to date has been in the area of finance. Another high priority of MOHMI is the&#13;
need to reorient the health care system to one with a stronger emphasis and primary and preventive care.&#13;
The objectives of the MOHMI and oblast health departments alike has been to provide an adequate basic&#13;
package of health care services to the population within the envelope of resources available.&#13;
1.36          The Government is also committed to supporting decentralization of heath care financing&#13;
and service delivery. This commitment has been expressed primarily through new health financing&#13;
legislation, which attempted to mobilize additional resources for the health sector, decentralize decision&#13;
making regarding resource allocation, and separate financing from provision of care. Still, appropriate&#13;
incentives must be introduced to improve resource allocation (especially to reflect priority for primary&#13;
care) by encouraging efficiency and quality of care.&#13;
1.37          While the Government's emphases are well placed and constitute necessary interventions&#13;
in support of health reform, they are not sufficiently broad in scope to achieve the comprehensive,&#13;
affordable level of care which the system aspires to provide. Health reform in Russia will require efforts&#13;
in three major areas: (i) restructuring, modernizing and upgrading the health system so it offers the best&#13;
possible service package within the available resource envelope; (ii) identifying a reliable and sustainable&#13;
source of financing which will provide adequate resources to finance a basic package of services to the&#13;
population; and (iii) inducing individuals to take greater responsibility for their own health.&#13;
1.38          Restructuring and modernizing the system will require major structural changes in the&#13;
health care delivery system. Among the changes envisaged are: greater emphasis on public health and&#13;
health promotion activities; rationalizing health care facilities, including eliminating a significant&#13;
proportion of hospital beds and closing facilities which do not provide high quality care; decreasing the&#13;
number of physicians, while upgrading medical training and reducing the excessive emphasis on&#13;
specialization; increasing the role of nurses and medical technicians; and striving to deliver a much&#13;
broader range of services through less costly out-patient facilities. While the introduction of the&#13;
earmarked payroll tax provided emergency first aid in the area of health finance, reliance on an ill-defined&#13;
system whose capacity to generate revenues is so closely tied to the overall state of the economy may not&#13;
be the appropriate means of providing a sustainable source of financing which ensures continuous&#13;
provision of essential health services. Finally, increasing individual responsibility for health can only be&#13;
achieved through programs to educate the public of the impact of lifestyle choices on their health status.&#13;
Although such programs currently exist, they have not been effective in influencing behavior and will&#13;
undoubtedly need to undergo major redesign to achieve their objectives.&#13;

II. BANK STRATEGY AND LESSONS LEARNED ]FROM PREVIOUS BANK EXPERIENCE&#13;
A. COuNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR RuSSIA&#13;
2.1          The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board on June 6, 1995; a&#13;
CAS Progress Report was discussed with the Board on March 28, 1996. Since the last CAS, the Bank&#13;
has continued to operate under an Intermediate Case scenario, which remains broadly appropriate in the&#13;
current environment. This scenario assumes that there will be continued progress in macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization, as evidenced by the recent agreement with the IMF on the Extended Fund Facility (EFF)&#13;
program. In this situation, the Bank would aim to provide around $1.2-1.5 billion annually in investment&#13;
lending, including a 'core" program of relatively straightforward projects in infrastructure and the social&#13;
sectors. In addition, the Bank would be willing to provide up to $1.5 billion annually in relatively fast-&#13;
disbursing assistance if substantial progress was achieved on key structural reforms in specific areas of&#13;
the economy, such as agriculture and the social sectors, that are critical to the long-term sustainability&#13;
of the stabilization process. Over the past year, the Bank has been working with the Govermnent, both&#13;
within the framework of the EFF negotiations and in separate discussions, to develop a consensus on&#13;
specific programs of structural reforms that would allow these latter operations to move forward. In the&#13;
meantime, the Bank has continued to prepare 6-7 priority investment projects as the basis for a sustained&#13;
program of Bank support for the Russian economy over the medium term.&#13;
2.2          The proposed operation is fully consistent with the CAS described above. In particular,&#13;
it would support two of the CAS's main objectives: (i) to moderate the impact of transition on socially&#13;
vulnerable groups by maintaining social services and infrastructure while improving the efficiency of&#13;
social expenditures; and (ii) to establish the Bank as a trusted and reliable development partner through&#13;
the financing of high priority public sector investments and policy advice on key health sector issues.&#13;
In terms of the specific sectoral objectives outlined in the CAS, this operation will help to rationalize&#13;
investment in the health sector by giving priority to primary and secondary health care facilities. The&#13;
proposed project also supports the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry's strategy of emphasizing&#13;
primary and outpatient care.&#13;
B. HEEALTH SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
Principles of Intervendion&#13;
2.3          Russia's current transition to a market economy may increase social strains even further,&#13;
producing greater morbidity and mortality. Thus, the situation requires careful health interventions, not&#13;
only to stem potential death and disease, but to reverse the recent adverse trends in health status. There&#13;
is no one right formula or sequence for reform; nor is there a quick fix that will dramatically improve&#13;
the health status of the population and reduce preventable deaths overnight. In spite of the rather grim&#13;
picture of health care in Russia, the country is fortunate to have many strengths on which to&#13;
build-notably, the almost universal access to care, a system of community-based polyclinics, and a large&#13;
base of human resources. To help Russia to capitalize on these assets while reforming its economy and&#13;
health care system, Bank interventions in the sector should be guided by the following three principles:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 12                       Bank Strategy and Lessons Learned From Previous Bank Experience&#13;
a.     Maintaining equitable access to services including coverage of the poor and&#13;
vulnerable groups;&#13;
b.     Cost effectiveness and affordability; and&#13;
c.    Improving the quality of health care to ensure appropriateness, efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
Strategic Goals&#13;
2.4          It should be noted that, although these principles would appear to be just and rational,&#13;
they have sparked debate worldwide, and have been difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, they remain goals&#13;
to which many countries aspire. Thus, to help the Government achieve them, the Bank would support&#13;
the following:&#13;
a.     Feasible reforms in health care financing, management and service delivery that&#13;
seek to provide efficient, cost-effective, decentralized care;&#13;
b.     Primary care, which can result in fewer referrals to higher levels and better out-&#13;
patient treatment for common health problems;&#13;
c.     The development of public health institutions and medical education that focus&#13;
on health promotion and primary care (that involves expanding the discipline of&#13;
family medicine); and&#13;
d.    Improved technology and facilities at the hospital level, in conjunction with&#13;
downsizing the number of beds and facilities.&#13;
2.5           The Bank's work program for the health sector would aim to include rigorous sector&#13;
analyses that can support well-focused policy advice along with lending that addresses the Government's&#13;
primary concerns. Project design would need to reflect the implementation constraints imposed by&#13;
administrative and Government structures and by the latter's lack of familiarity with Bank policies and&#13;
guidelines. In addition, it would also need to reflect the fact that health care is provided and financed&#13;
by regional governments whose needs must be addressed; and, it would try to support the MOHMI and&#13;
other federal entities' attempts to define their roles and perform effectively in a decentralized system (as&#13;
these structural changes add new layers of complexity). Further, it would attempt to address the issue of&#13;
health care financing (in order to provide appropriate incentives and adequate resources), and the delivery&#13;
of services, where outdated protocols and organizational structures impede efficient resource allocation.&#13;
C. PROPOSED LENDING PROGRAM&#13;
2.6           Modernizing and upgrading the health system will require large amounts of investment&#13;
in a system where know-how and technology are out of date and infrastructure is run-down from years&#13;
of neglect. The focus of Bank support will be to help the various institutions and individuals involved&#13;
in health sector reform (federal and local public authorities, health facilities, health workers and&#13;
consumers) define and carry out their roles under the changing system. Bank input will consist of&#13;
technical advice and investment financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                      Page 13&#13;
2.7          In the context of stagnant and declining real resources for social services, the Bank is&#13;
developing three projects that are designed to meet (i) the immediate needs for maintaining core services&#13;
operating at adequate levels and (ii) longer term objectives of improving resource utilization (efficiency)&#13;
and outcomes (effectiveness). In addition to the proposed Medical Equipment Project, there are two other&#13;
projects in the lending program which either deal exclusively with or have a significant health component.&#13;
2.8           The proposed Health Reform Pilot Project would serve as a template for more&#13;
comprehensive health sector reform in Kaluga and Tver oblasts. It would support improvements in health&#13;
financing, including more rational use of available resources through appropriate incentives to providers.&#13;
It would also address service delivery issues including clinical protocols and provision of care by&#13;
appropriate level facilities (e.g., outpatient whenever possible).  Because it will have a longer&#13;
implementation period, it can support the development of new approaches to the organization and delivery&#13;
of health services, including fundamental reorganization of the health care delivery system to emphasize&#13;
ambulatory care. A particular focus of the project would be improving provider payment mechanisms&#13;
to introduce incentives for more efficient provision of health services.&#13;
2.9           The Community Social Infrastructure Project supports construction-related investments&#13;
in three sectors-health, education and water supply. A pilot project directed at Novosibirsk and Rostov&#13;
oblasts, it aims to improve the allocation of public expenditures at the oblast level while supporting&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading of inadequate and deteriorating social infrastructure. The project would&#13;
primarily finance deferred maintenance and restoration of service capacity of social sector institutions,&#13;
such as schools, hospitals and polyclinics.&#13;
2.10         While all of the health-related projects in the Bank's lending pipeline have complementary&#13;
objectives which target major issues in the sector, comprehenrive health reform in Russia, as in other&#13;
industrialized countries, will undoubtedly be a long-term evolutionary process.&#13;
D. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREvIous BANK EXPERIENCE&#13;
2.11          The proposed Medical Equipment Project would be the Bank's first lending operation&#13;
specifically aimed at the health sector of the Russian Federation.  Many valuable lessons of&#13;
experience-drawn from other Bank-assisted projects in Russia and from health projects in other&#13;
countries-have been taken into consideration during project preparation and have been incorporated into&#13;
its design.&#13;
2.12          Project performance in Russia is affected by the same issues as in other countries; in&#13;
particular, insufficient Borrower ownership of projects and lack of implementation capacity have already&#13;
impacted negatively on project implementation. In addition, as a relatively new Borrower, lack of&#13;
familiarity with the Bank's procurement guidelines and loan processing procedures has also contributed&#13;
to delays in project implementation. The first and second Country Portfolio Performance Reviews&#13;
(CPPRs) for Russia in September 1994 and February 1995, respectively, made the following&#13;
recommendations to address the implementation issues which have been specifically identified:&#13;
a.    Project design should be simple;&#13;
b.    An appropriate balance of local and international expertise should be used during&#13;
project preparation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 14                       Bank Strategy and Lessons Learned From Previous Bank Experience&#13;
c.    Agreement should be reached early with the Borrower on issues such as cost&#13;
recovery and nearly all project conditionality should be satisfied by the time of&#13;
negotiations;&#13;
d.     An implementation unit should be established early during the project preparation&#13;
stage;&#13;
e.    The PPIU should be properly trained in Bank procedures and endowed with&#13;
sufficient authority, staffing, and other resources to perform its responsibilities;&#13;
f.     External technical assistance should be provided in areas where the Borrower's&#13;
experience is limited, e.g. procurement; and&#13;
g.    Implementation delays should be avoided by advancing--as much of the&#13;
procurement process as possible to the project preparation stage.&#13;
2.13          The first Rehabilitation Loan (L35130) to Russia which financed US$118 million of&#13;
pharmaceuticals, raw materials for pharmaceutical production, and spare parts for medical equipment,&#13;
provided many practical lessons of experience relevant to the proposed project:&#13;
a.     Availability of counterpart funds and applicable taxes should be adequately&#13;
appraised in order to minimize delays at the time of delivery;&#13;
b.    Procurement organized on the basis of positive "shopping lists" is both possible&#13;
and efficient;&#13;
c.     Centrally organized procurement can produce substantial price discounts; and&#13;
d.    Records are generally well kept which allows for satisfactory inspection,&#13;
forwarding and distribution of goods.&#13;
2.14          Experience with health projects in other countries underscore many of the above&#13;
mentioned lessons. For example, the inadequate capacity of a Borrower to implement human resource&#13;
development projects is often a factor in negative project performance. Additionally, the inability of the&#13;
Borrower to provide the necessary counterpart funds is mentioned as a particular area of concem in&#13;
human resource oriented projects. Bank experience with health projects has in general provided the&#13;
following additional lessons applicable to the proposed project:&#13;
a.     Participatory project planning is crucial-equipment delivered to a facility should&#13;
be based on the needs of that particular facility;&#13;
b.     End-users must be trained in the use and maintenance of equipment with which&#13;
they are unfamiliar or the equipment risks being under-utilized; and&#13;
c.     Questions of sustainability and project risks should be adequately addressed-the&#13;
capacity of the Government to mobilize resources to cover future costs should be&#13;
realistically assessed.&#13;
&#13;

2.15          In sum, the proposed project has benefitted from the previous experiences of Bank-&#13;
assisted projects in Russia and elsewhere. All of the above lessons were taken into account during project&#13;
preparation to facilitate timely and successful project implementation. The following chapters will&#13;
illustrate how these lessons have been incorporated into the proposed project's design.&#13;

III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1           The purpose of this project is to initiate structural reform of the health care system in&#13;
Russia. Specifically, the proposed Medical Equipment Project is designed to:&#13;
a.     Increase the availability, range and quality of services provided by primary health&#13;
care facilities and raion hospitals;&#13;
b.     Reorient service delivery toward more cost effective health care;&#13;
c.     Decentralize decision making for capital investments to the facility level; and&#13;
d.     Support policy development through the introduction of national health accounts.&#13;
3.2           Because of the large number of facilities which are potentially eligible to participate in&#13;
the project (up to 700 hospitals and 10,000 polyclinics), the project proposes to monitor its impact on&#13;
development objectives by collecting utilization data, on a sample basis, for equipment delivered to each&#13;
of the participating oblasts and by establishing that all equipment has been delivered to and installed at&#13;
the designated sites.&#13;
B. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT&#13;
3.3            The proposed project has been developed in response to the Ministry of Finance's request&#13;
for a quick-disbursing operation which would provide tied in-kind budgetary support to selected oblasts2&#13;
to supplement the usual mechanism of untied block grants. Until now the majority of federal budgetary&#13;
support has been through the latter mechanism. Even in the cases of specific federal health programs&#13;
(e.g., Children of Chernobyl), very often the use of funds is only loosely related to the program&#13;
objectives and there is generally little, if any, monitoring of expenditures and outcomes. Therefore, this&#13;
operation represents a significant step in terms of federal oblast fiscal relationships in that it would help&#13;
to establish a precedent of tying federal budgetary support to well targeted, high priority programs.&#13;
3.4           As a preliminary step preceding comprehensive health reform, the proposed project would&#13;
strengthen selected facilities-particularly, polyclinics and raion hospitals-whose role would need to be&#13;
enhanced to increase efficiency in the provision of health care. Specifically, the equipment supplied&#13;
would enable polyclinics to provide, on a less expensive outpatient basis, services currently offered only&#13;
in hospitals. Similarly, equipping raion hospitals to provide a wider range of services will avoid&#13;
unnecessary referrals to the central oblast hospitals and facilitate follow-up on patients' post-hospital care.&#13;
The project would also strengthen the Federal Government's capacity to monitor health spending which&#13;
is an essential step in rationalizing health expenditures. The proposed project can, therefore, be justified&#13;
on the basis of its contribution in preparing for more comprehensive reform.&#13;
2 The Russian Federation comprises 89 oblasts, republics, krais and okrugs. The terms "oblast" and "region' are used&#13;
interchangeably within this report to refer to them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 18                                                        Project Objectives and Description&#13;
C. PROJECT DESIGN&#13;
3.5            Project beneficiaries would be health care facilities in 34 oblasts selected by the Ministry&#13;
of Finance (MOF) (see list in Annex A and IBRD Map No. 27183). In order to avoid the need for a&#13;
protracted period of project preparation, targeted facilities would select from a carefully developed&#13;
"positive" list of equipment which has been designed to provide basic and essential medical equipment&#13;
which would be generally useful, even in the event of a major restructuring of the health care system in&#13;
the future.&#13;
3.6           The strategy underlying project design is to provide inputs that would help meet&#13;
immediate needs to support short-term actions aimed at improving the health status while, at the same&#13;
time, positioning the targeted facilities to respond to future policy changes geared toward establishing a&#13;
more efficient health care system. The targeted facilities include all outpatient facilities plus raion&#13;
hospitals and maternity homes. The emphasis on outpatient facilities is intended to position the health&#13;
care system to provide a larger proportion of services through ambulatory, rather than in-patient, facilities&#13;
in the future. This is a trend which is already well established in other industrialized countries. The&#13;
reason for including only raion hospitals and maternity homes as potential beneficiaries is to strengthen&#13;
these secondary level facilities to be able to provide services which are now provided by higher level&#13;
facilities. Oblast level hospitals (tertiary level facilities) have been excluded from participation, because,&#13;
on the whole, they have, in the past, received a disproportionate share of investment funds. Specialized&#13;
and district hospitals have been excluded because, in the event of a comprehensive program of&#13;
rationalization of health care facilities, many of these institutions would likely be candidates for closure&#13;
or redeployment to non-medical uses, such as elder housing.&#13;
3.7           One important feature of project design is the requirement that beneficiary facilities be&#13;
required to place their own orders. The allocation of the loan to participating oblasts will be made by&#13;
the MOF. Participating oblasts will, in turn, indicate the allocations available to participating facilities.&#13;
Each participating facility will be provided with an order form which includes estimated delivered cost&#13;
for each item and would have to select the highest priority medical equipment within its allocation.&#13;
Although simple in principle, this concept is an important innovation in terms of the Russian health care&#13;
system where, even following decentralization, these kinds of decisions are not usually made at the&#13;
facility level.&#13;
3.8           The 34 participating oblasts were selected by the Ministry of Finance and include oblasts&#13;
which would otherwise have been eligible for non-earmarked block grants from the federal government.&#13;
The allocation of funds among participating oblasts was also determined by the Ministry of Finance. An&#13;
analysis of the oblasts selected for participation indicates that they are fairly average overall in terms of&#13;
levels of health spending, availability of health facilities and physicians and health status of the&#13;
population. Within the parameters described above (para. 3.6), the oblast health department selected the&#13;
facilities to participate in the project. Participating facilities will place their equipment orders within the&#13;
allocation indicated by the oblast health department. The fact that resources provided under the project&#13;
are finite and are not sufficient to meet all the needs of facilities eligible to participate substantially&#13;
mitigates the risk of over-ordering by facilities. Facilities will be compelled to assess the tradeoffs and&#13;
determine the most productive use of available resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

D. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.9            The proposed project would have three components: (a) medical equipment; (b) national&#13;
health accounts; and (c) project management.&#13;
Medical Equipment (US$300. 0 million of total project costs)&#13;
3.10           The project would finance medical equipment, related supplies and training, furniture,&#13;
spare parts and maintenance equipment to targeted health care facilities in 34 oblasts. The target facilities&#13;
comprise primary (polyclinics, women's clinics and feldsher stations) and secondary (raion hospitals and&#13;
maternity homes) health care facilities. Providing medical equipment to these facilities would increase&#13;
the availability and range of health services they are able to provide and would contribute to providing&#13;
more cost effective diagnosis and treatment. In the past, such facilities have been neglected in favor of&#13;
more sophisticated facilities such as central oblast and specialized hospitals. This intervention would de&#13;
facto redirect a significant part of the health sector investment budget to lower level, more cost effective&#13;
providers. Health care facilities in participating oblasts would select equipment from an agreed list&#13;
prepared to reflect the responsibilities and functions of the facilities (Annex B). As a condition of&#13;
participation, project oblasts are required to ensure that beneficiary facilities participate directly in&#13;
ordering equipment (para. 7.2 (a)).&#13;
3.11           The equipment list has been developed to allow beneficiary facilities to fill the gaps in&#13;
medical equipment available in primary and secondary level health care facilities, including maintenance&#13;
equipment and spare parts. The list was designed to enable the targeted facilities to meet the following&#13;
clinical objectives:&#13;
a.     Primary level facilities should perform activities that represent the first contact&#13;
between the population and the health care system. These activities include:&#13;
i.     Primary outpatient examination;&#13;
ii.    Screening of social pathologies;&#13;
iii.    Medical support for healthy children (including vaccination);&#13;
iv.    Prenatal medical support and care;&#13;
v.     Emergency care;&#13;
vi.    Chronic disease care (e.g., tuberculosis);&#13;
vii.    Education and community support;&#13;
viii.   Referral to higher level facilities;&#13;
ix.    Short hospitalization; and&#13;
x.     Basic diagnostics (small laboratory and basic radiological systems).&#13;
b.     Secondary level facilities' activities are complementary to those delivered by&#13;
primary care facilities and include:&#13;
i.     Medical-surgical emergencies and acute care;&#13;
ii.    Deliveries;&#13;
iii.    Hospitalization of cases referred by primary facilities;&#13;
iv.    Laboratory;&#13;
v.     Radiology;&#13;
vi.    Medical support for cases referred by the primary level;&#13;
vii.    Surgery; and&#13;
viii.   Specialized diagnosis and treatment.&#13;
Theoretically, only a relatively small number of cases should need to be referred to the tertiary level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 20                                                        Project Objectives and Description&#13;
3.12          However, recognizing that the health care network in Russia suffers from excessive&#13;
conipartmentalization, the list has also been designed to encourage a reorientation of the system, including&#13;
clarifying the respective roles of primary and secondary level facilities.&#13;
3.13          In formulating the list of medical equipment which can be provided under the project,&#13;
both the present situation in the Russian Federation in terms of epidemiology (mainly the morbidity and&#13;
mortality structure) and the organization of the existing health care system were taken into consideration.&#13;
The list of medical equipment to be provided under the project would enable health care facilities to deal&#13;
more effectively in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease, trauma and cancer. The final list of&#13;
medical equipment and related supplies reflects the advice of local practitioners and specialists in medical&#13;
equipment, the relevant federal ministries, as well as that of foreign experts who have also had experience&#13;
with the Russian health care system.&#13;
3.14          As mentioned above, the positive list is intended to address the highest priority health&#13;
problems identified by analysis of epidemiological data. The major features of the morbidity and&#13;
mortality structure in Russia were discussed in Chapter I. In particular, the following were considered&#13;
in formulating the equipment list:&#13;
a.     High rates of ischemic heart diseases, cerebro-vascular diseases, cancer, and&#13;
respiratory diseases.  Equipment to be provided would support screening&#13;
programs and simple treatment procedures to address these diseases.&#13;
b.     Trauma and poisoning is the second largest cause of death, and, as if affects&#13;
mainly younger and middle aged men, it causes a large loss of potential years of&#13;
life. Consequently, the equipment list includes items to strengthen emergency&#13;
medical care.&#13;
C.     Maternal and child health constitute one of the most serious public health&#13;
problems in the Russian Federation. This equipment list includes all the&#13;
necessary means to strengthen a prenatal care program, including equipment for&#13;
antenatal care, deliveries, postpartum care, neonatal care and vaccination (cold&#13;
chain).&#13;
3.15          Because of regional differences, even similar facilities may have different needs in various&#13;
parts of the Russian Federation. These variations mandate that the equipment list should comprehensively&#13;
cover the morbidity/mortality structure, including the specific needs of certain regions or oblasts, within,&#13;
of course, the functions defined above.&#13;
3.16          To help ensure that the equipment would be fully utilized, the proposed project would also&#13;
finance necessary consumable supplies, and technical training in the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
equipment. Training would be organized by suppliers for medical personnel at participating facilities. In&#13;
addition, participating facilities would provide additional clinical training, if needed, in the use of the more&#13;
complex equipment (para.7.2 (b)). The project would finance up to about one year's supply of consumables&#13;
with the medical equipment provided. As a condition of participating in the project, however, oblast&#13;
administrations were requested to ensure that adequate resources be made available so as to make full use of&#13;
the equipment (para. 7.2 (c)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Nadonal Health Accounts (US$3.0 million of total project costs)&#13;
3.17          With decentralization of the responsibility for health sector financing and the introduction of&#13;
mandatory health insurance in 1993, tracking of health expenditures has become increasingly complicated.&#13;
The lack of reliable data on sources and uses of health finance has been a major- impediment to the&#13;
development of health sector policy during the economic transitioni. Accurate and timely information on health&#13;
expenditures is important for many reasons. It is an essential element in providing the analytical framework&#13;
that is needed to: effectively plan and manage health programs; deternine appropriate resource allocations&#13;
both within the health sector and among health and other sectors; evaluate the causes of changes in health&#13;
status; and facilitate comparisons with health care systems in other countries. During negotiations, overall&#13;
agreement was reached on designing and implementing a system of national health accounts (para 7.3 (a)).&#13;
Because of the nature of this task, which would cut across ministries and might eventually create the need for&#13;
additional mandatory statistical reporting on the part of both public and private entities, it was required that&#13;
a governmental decree endorsing this work be issued as a condition of negotiations.&#13;
3.18          The project would provide the necessary support to develop and implement a system of&#13;
national health accounts (NHA) for Russia. This component would complement ongoing work financed under&#13;
an IDF grant to improve the quality of national income and product accounts for Russia and implementation&#13;
of this component will be done in conformity with efforts to improve account standards nationally under the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The approach that would be followed is to: develop a framework for national health&#13;
accounts which is comparable to those used in other industrialized countries but which respects the existing&#13;
statistical reporting conventions in Russia; inventory the sources of data that are currently available; arrange&#13;
for existing data to be compiled into NRA format by a designated agency (most likely MOHM); identify gaps&#13;
in available data and propose least cost methods for obtaining the required data (Annex C). The proposed&#13;
project would include financing of consultant services for survey design and data collection, computer&#13;
hardware and software to support this effort and study tours of NHA systems in OECD countries.&#13;
Project Management (US$2.0 milon of total project costs)&#13;
3.19          A Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPI  has been established as an agent of&#13;
the Ministry of Finance to administer and manage the proposed project. The PPIU would continue in&#13;
existence through project implementation to loan closing and would then be disbanded. The proposed project&#13;
would finance the operating costs of the PPIU, including salaries of long-term consulting staff, office&#13;
accommodation, supplies and equipment, utilities, staff travel and training, and consultant services. Although&#13;
the PPIU would not continue as an ongoing institution after project completion, staff trained in procurement&#13;
and project management would likely be absorbed into other institutions requiring these skldls and would&#13;
continue to contribute to the successful implementation of the Government's investment program.&#13;
E. ENVIRONMErAL AsPECS&#13;
3.20          This is a category "C" project.  No adverse environmental impacts are anticipated.&#13;
Participating facilities would be required to certify that physical plant meets established federal safety standards&#13;
before ordering equipment, such as radiology eqipmlent, which is subject to such standards.&#13;

IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A. PROJICr CoSIS&#13;
4.1           The cost of the project is estimated at US$305.0 million equivalent including duties and taxes.&#13;
The estimated local costs and foreign costs by components are shown in Table 4.1 below. Detailed cost&#13;
estimates by type of expenditure are contained in Annex D.&#13;

BaiL of Cost Eslimates&#13;
4.2           Project costs have been estimated in US dollars because of the difficulty in forecasting&#13;
inflation rates for local currency. Cost estimates for the medical and other equipment, spare parts and supplies&#13;
have been derived from recent studies by local and foreign medical health specialists when developing the list&#13;
of goods to be financed under this project. The goods to be financed are appropriate to the basic needs of&#13;
the health care system as needed to accomplish the objectives of the project. The staff-month rates for both&#13;
the foreign and local specialists are based on actual cost experience in several on-going Bank assisted projects&#13;
in the Russian Federation.&#13;
Foreign Costs Component&#13;
4.3           The foreign costs of each component was estimated as follows: (a) medical and computer&#13;
equipment; spare parts and supplies, 80%; (b) studies and surveys-for studies with foreign participation, 90%&#13;
and for those carried out by local consultants, 10%; and (c) PPIU operting expenses, 10%. The foreign costs&#13;
component of US$226.8 million represents about 78% of total project costs, net of duties and taxes which&#13;
reflects the nature of the project (i.e., a high percentage of goods to be procured utilizing ICB and LIB&#13;
procedures).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Condngency AUlowances&#13;
4.4           Since project expenditures would be limited by the total allocation for the various components,&#13;
no physical contingencies have been included. Price contingencies, representing an average of about two&#13;
percent of the base cost of the project, have been included on both local and foreign costs, expressed in US&#13;
dollars, since a high percentage of the funds are expected to be committed in the first year of implementation.&#13;
Taxes and Duties&#13;
4.5           The proposed project would be suibject to taxes and duties at rates in effect at the time of&#13;
delivery. Medical equipment is currently exempt from both customs duties and taxes. However, multiple use&#13;
items (e.g. furniture and some supplies) would be subject to customs duties and taxes. Therefore, an average&#13;
total tax rate of 3% has been used. For computer hardware and software, taxes of 21.5% has been applied&#13;
to the total estimated cost and 5% customs duties for that portion expected to be imported. Regulations&#13;
regarding taxes on consultants varies depending on, inter alia, the length of contract; therefore, taxes have not&#13;
been identified and included in the cost estimate.&#13;
4.6           The current estimated tax liability of the project (US$8.0 million) is calculated based on the&#13;
above described expectations. However, it is recognized that the current tax legislation may change. The&#13;
PPIU would continue to monitor any changes in rates or collection procedures related to customs duties and&#13;
VAT. The participating regions were informed that they would be responsible for financing all taxes (up to&#13;
20% of project costs or US$54 million). Therefore, the participating oblasts would be expected to finance&#13;
any increase in project tax liabilities above the current estimated amount.&#13;
B. PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
4.7           The proposed project is expected to have a total project cost of US$305.0 million (including&#13;
taxes and duties of US$8.0 million), with a foreign cost component of US$226.8 million. The proposed Bank&#13;
loan of $270 million would finance 100 percent of the foreign costs and 55 percent of local costs excluding&#13;
taxes and duties. Participating regions would provide counterpart funds amounting to 45 percent of local costs&#13;
(38 percent net of taxes) and 11 percent of total project costs (9 percent net of taxes). In order to participate&#13;
in the project, regions would provide the expected counterpart funds and finance all applicable customs duties&#13;
and taxes (para. 7.3 (d)). Loan funds would be made available by the Government to participating regions&#13;
on a grant basis. The financing plan is shown in Table 4.2 below:&#13;

Counterpart Funds&#13;
4.8           Counterpart funds collected from the participating regions would be used to finance local&#13;
expenses in the amount of US$27 million equivalent. It is expected that these expenses would be related to&#13;
the local storage, transportation and insurance of equipment, the services of the Consolidation and Forwarding&#13;
Agent, and locally manufactured equipment, spare parts and supplies.&#13;
Recurent Cost Implications and Sustainability&#13;
4.9           The provision of replacement or additional medical equipment to health care facilities would&#13;
result in an increase in depreciation (a non-cash expense) and, in some cases, would create the need for&#13;
additional consumable items, such as X-ray film, reagents, etc. As indicated in the financing plan,&#13;
participating oblasts are required to contribute about 10 percent of total project costs (plus applicable customs&#13;
duties and taxes). The majority of this contribution would likely fall due in the first year of project&#13;
implementation. Within this timeframe, the proposed project would finance about one year's supply of&#13;
consumables to support utilization of the medical equipment provided. Following this, the participating oblasts&#13;
would commit to providing sufficient resources to supply the required consumables (para 3.16).&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
Summary of Procurement Procedures&#13;
4.10          The PPIU would be responsible for managing procurement under the proposed project.&#13;
A Procurement Consultant would assist the PPIU in all aspects of the procurement process. Procurement&#13;
of goods and services would be in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 (revised January 1996) and "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated August 1981.&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents (Goods) and Form of Contracts (Services) issued by the Bank would be used&#13;
as appropriate for the goods and services to be procured. Goods would grouped in the most efficient&#13;
manner possible and the proposed packaging would be reviewed by the Bank. The estimated procurement&#13;
arrangements are presented in Table 4.3 and described below.&#13;

Procurement of Goods&#13;
4.11         Goods (US$283.9 million) consisting of medical and computer equipment, spare parts and&#13;
supplies would be procured utilizing the following methods of procurement:&#13;
a.    International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be utilized for medical&#13;
equipment, supplies and computer equipment estimated to cost US$247.7 million&#13;
(87% of total goods) for contracts above US$300,000 equivalent each. It is&#13;
estimated that there would be approximately 110 contracts with an average value&#13;
of US$2.2 million awarded using ICB procurement procedures.&#13;
b.    Limited International Bidding (LIB) procedures would be used for purchases,&#13;
estimated to cost an aggregate of US$19.4 million (7% of total goods). LIB&#13;
would be used for specialized purchases such as endoscopic and ultrasonic&#13;
medical equipment where few qualified suppliers are available. The Procurement&#13;
Consultant would ensure that all qualified suppliers are invited to bid. It is&#13;
estimated that there would be approximately 5 contracts with an average value&#13;
of US$3.9 million awarded using LIEB procurement procedures.&#13;
c.    National Competitive Bidding (NCB) would be permitted for the procurement of&#13;
specialized medical instrument sets and furniture with a contract value below&#13;
US$300,000 because the local industry is very competitive in comparison to&#13;
foreign suppliers. An aggregate limit of US$3.4 million (1 % of total goods)&#13;
would be permitted utilizing NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. It is&#13;
estimated that there would be approximately 12 contracts with an average value&#13;
of US$283,000 awarded using NCB procurement procedures.&#13;
d.    International and National Shopping (IS and NS) procedures would be used for&#13;
readily available, off-the-shelf items of small value and standard specifications.&#13;
It is expected that consumables, non-proprietary spare parts, minor medical&#13;
equipment and the PPIU's computer equipment would be procured using ISINS&#13;
procedures (2 % of total goods). IS procedures would be used for goods valued&#13;
at less than US$300,000 up to an aggregate US$4.3 million. It is estimated that&#13;
there would be approximately 40 contracts with an average value of US$215,000&#13;
awarded using IS procurement procedures. NS procedures would be used for&#13;
such locally available goods valued at less than US$50,000 up to an aggregate&#13;
of US$2.0 million. It is estimated that there would be approximately 45&#13;
contracts with an average value of US$45,000 awarded using NS procurement&#13;
procedures. Three quotations would be required for each of the contract awards.&#13;
Under IS procedures, the quotations would have to be from at least three&#13;
suppliers from at least two eligible countries.&#13;
e.    Direct Contracting (DC) for procurement of spare parts, inter alia, where the&#13;
required goods are proprietary and obtainable from only one source may be&#13;
utilized with prior review by the Bank. This method would primarily be used&#13;
after the first round of bidding for proprietary spare parts and proprietary&#13;
consumable items. An upper limit of about US$7.1 million (3% of total goods)&#13;
utilizing this procedure is anticipated. It is estimated that there would be&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 28                              Project Costs, Financing, Procurement and Disbursements&#13;
approximately 75 contracts with an average value of US$95,000 awarded using&#13;
DC procurement procedures.&#13;
f.    Procurement from UN Agencies. Should it be determined that procurement of&#13;
medical equipment and supplies could be carried out in a more efficient and&#13;
effective way from UNICEF or other UN Agencies, then such procedure could&#13;
be used, subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
Notification of Business Opportunities&#13;
4.12         A General Procurement Notice was published in the January 31, 1996 issue of the UN&#13;
publication "Development Business" and, as appropriate, would be updated and published annually&#13;
thereafter. For goods to be obtained by ICB, individual bidding opportunities would be advertised prior&#13;
to the availability of bidding documents and transmitted to potential bidders who expressed interest in&#13;
bidding in response to the published General Procurement Notice. These advertisements would be in&#13;
English. The specific notice for the first round ICB procurement was published in the April 26, 1996&#13;
issue of Izvestia and in the April 30, 1996 issue of the Financial Times.&#13;
4.13         In order to encourage the maximum possible competition in supplying medical equipment&#13;
to be provided under the project, a business opportunities seminar was conducted in Moscow on&#13;
December 8, 1995. The assistance of the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry was utilized during&#13;
the preparation of the seminar to identify local manufacturers who might be interested in participating.&#13;
In addition, the seminar was announced in the November 27, 1995 issue of the daily Moscow newspaper&#13;
"Business World" so that any interested suppliers not directly contacted could also participate.&#13;
Preference for Domestically Manufactured Goods&#13;
4.14         For contracts for goods to be awarded on the basis of ICB, the Borrower may, as set forth&#13;
in the Loan Agreement, grant a margin of preference of 15 % or the amount of applicable customs duties,&#13;
whichever is lower, to qualified domestic manufacturers of goods. For many of the items to be procured,&#13;
it is envisaged that Russian suppliers will be competitive.&#13;
Procurement of Consulting and Technical Services&#13;
4.15         Specialists and/or consulting firms (US$4.6 million in addition to US$1.5 financed by the&#13;
PPF) would be hired on terms and conditions (including review of their qualifications), in accordance&#13;
with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated August&#13;
1981. The services of the Procurement Consultant (consisting of a joint venture between a foreign and&#13;
national firm) have already been contracted following competitive procedures. The provision of these&#13;
services, initially financed by the PPF, would continue during project implementation. Other consulting&#13;
contracts valued above US$200,000 would be awarded to firms and/or individuals on the basis of&#13;
competitive procedures using short-lists. Contracts below US$200,000 may be awarded to firms and/or&#13;
individuals on the basis of competitive or direct contracting procedures in accordance with the Guidelines.&#13;
4.16         Technical services to be provided by the Consolidation and Forwarding Agent (US$13.5&#13;
million) would be obtained by LIB procedures. Work included, inter alia, would be provision of&#13;
warehouse space in Russia, receipt and inspection of goods, insurance, consolidation and transport to end-&#13;
&#13;

the National Health Accounts component.&#13;
Operatng Costs of the PPIU&#13;
4.18         All costs of maintaining the PPITJ (US$1.0 million including US$0.5 million financed by the&#13;
PPF) would be eligible for financing under the loan, including salaries of long-term consultancy staff, travel,&#13;
office rent and utilities, minor office equipment, etc. Operating costs of the PPIU would be expensed on the&#13;
basis of on annual budget approved by the Bank and procured in accordance with Bank guidelines and the&#13;
procedures agreed upon for goods and consulting services procured under the project. All expenditures are&#13;
expected to cost less than US$50,000 each and would be subject to ex-post review.&#13;
Project Preparaton Faciliy (PPF)&#13;
4.19         To advance project preparation, a PPF in the amount of US$1.0 million (Letter of Agreement&#13;
No. 277-0 RU) approved by the Bank on August 2, 1995 and countersigned by the Government on September&#13;
6, 1995 has been used to finance the services of the Procurement Consultant. A supplemental PPF of US$1.0&#13;
million (Letter of Agreement No. 277-1 RU) was approved by the Bank on March 4, 1996 and countersigned&#13;
by the Government on April 2, 1996 to finance the continued services of the Procurement Consultant, other&#13;
consulting services, and operating expenses of the PPIU until Loan effectiveness.&#13;
Review By Bank of Procurement Decisions&#13;
4.20         Prior review of bidding documents for goods, including review of evaluations and&#13;
recommendations for award of contracts, would be carried out for all procurement utilizing ICB and LIB&#13;
procedures; all recommendations and documentation for direct contracting woulld also be subject to prior&#13;
review. To ensure compliance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, the first two tontracts to be&#13;
awarded by National Competitive Bidding (NCB) and International Shopping (IS) procedures would be&#13;
subject to prior Bank review. The list of goods to be procured and the standardized bidding documents&#13;
for these transactions would also be subject to prior review. Contracts for consultant services would be&#13;
subject to prior review for those contracts greater than US$50,000 for individuals and US$100,000 for&#13;
firms except that TOR for all consulting services shall be reviewed on a prior review basis by the Bank.&#13;
Accordingly, over 90 percent (by volume) of procurement transactions would be subject to prior review&#13;
by the Bank. The documentation for all procurement transactions not subject to prior Bank review could&#13;
be subject to ex-post review during the Bank's periodic project supervision missions.&#13;
4.21         After award, should any material modifications or waiver of the terms and conditions of&#13;
a contract result in an increase above 15 % of the original price, the Bank would reserve the right of prior&#13;
review of such modifications (included would be modifications in contracts for Consulting Services).&#13;

Procurement Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
4.22          The Procurement Consultant would be responsible for establishing and maintaining a&#13;
computerized monitoring and reporting system acceptable to the PPIU and Bank that would, inter alia,&#13;
provide an up-to-date inventory of goods procured, consolidated, and delivered to end-users. Status&#13;
reports from this system would accompany the PPIU's regular project progress reports sent to the Bank.&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)&#13;
4.23          A CPAR has not been prepared for the Russian Federation. A CPAR is scheduled to be&#13;
undertaken and a report issued before the end of the current calendar year. For this proposed project,&#13;
the Government would follow agreed procurement procedures (in accordance with Bank guidelines) as&#13;
described above and as set forth in the Loan Agreement.&#13;
D. DLSBURSEMENTS&#13;
Schedule&#13;
4.24          The proposed loan would be disbursed over about three years which includes six months&#13;
for the finalization of accounts and submission of withdrawal applications and other reports. The&#13;
disbursement forecast (Annex E) is based on a detailed work program which is advanced due to the use&#13;
of the PPF and which Bank staff consider realistic. The estimated project completion date is December&#13;
31, 1998 and the loan dosing date is June 30, 1999.&#13;
Disbursement Percentages&#13;
4.25          The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed as shown below.&#13;

4.26         Disbursements would be fully documented except for (i) goods costing less than&#13;
$300,000; (ii) technical and consultant services contracted with firms costing less than $100,000; and (iii)&#13;
consulting services contract with individuals costing less than US$50,000; and (iv) PPIU operating&#13;
expenses less than $50,000 where certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) would be used.&#13;
Disbursement/procurement documents using SOE procedures would be retained by the PPIU and made&#13;
available to Bank staff and to auditors.&#13;
Special Account&#13;
4.27         To facilitate payments of small and medium size amrounts in foreign currency and all&#13;
payments in local currency, the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the PPIU would open and maintain a&#13;
Special Account in US dollars in a commercial bank acceptable to IBRD. The criteria are described in&#13;
Annex F. The maximum authorized allocation of the Special Account would be US$1,500,000. The&#13;
initial amount to be deposited at the beginning of disbursements would be US$500,000. This amount&#13;
could be increased to the maximum authorized allocation once cumulative disbursements have reached&#13;
US$2,500,000. The allocation to the Special Account would be replenished on the basis of satisfactory&#13;
documentary evidence, to be provided to IBRD by the PPIU, of payments made from the account for&#13;
goods and services required for the project. In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Account,&#13;
which have been reconciled by the PPIU, would accompany all replenishment applications. The&#13;
minimum application size for payments made directly from the loan account or for the issuance of Special&#13;
Commitment is 20% of the Special Account authorized allocation.&#13;
Accounts and Auditing&#13;
4.28         In addition to the Special Account, the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the PPIU would&#13;
establish and maintain a local currency Project Account. Each of the participating regions would directly&#13;
deposit its share of the required counterpart funds (10 percent of the loan amount plus incurred taxes and&#13;
duties) into the rouble project account following a timetable prepared to coincide with the equipment&#13;
delivery. This schedule would be confirmed at the Project Launch workshop scheduled to occur directly&#13;
after the bidding documents for the first round of procurement are issued and about 5 months before the&#13;
first delivery of equipment.&#13;
4.29         The PPIU in coordination with MOF would be responsible for the appropriate accounting&#13;
of funds provided under the loan and by the Borrower, would maintain consolidated accounts for the&#13;
project and would prepare monthly financial reports, and would ensure that audits of the financial&#13;
statements or reports are timely submitted to Bank. Accounting for all Special Account transactions and&#13;
for all other project-related accounts would be maintained in accordance with international accounting&#13;
standards.&#13;
4.30         Project accounts, including the Special Account, maintained by the PPIU would be audited&#13;
annually in accordance with the Bank's 'Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank", dated March 1982 by auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audits would also&#13;
be carried out, at the same time and for corresponding periods in accordance with the Bank's guidelines,&#13;
for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made from the loan and SOEs&#13;
which would be included in the audit reports accompanying the financial statements. The audited&#13;
financial statements for the Special Account, project accounts, and SOEs of the preceding fiscal year and&#13;
the resulting audit report in such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a&#13;
separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made against certified statements of expenditure, would&#13;
be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the Government's fiscal year.&#13;

V. PROJECT STATUS, IMPLEMENTATION, EVALUATION AND SUPERVISION&#13;
A. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
5.1          The project is in an advanced stage of preparation. As an early step, 37 oblasts were&#13;
identified as eligible to participate in the project and notified of their tentative shares of the loan amount&#13;
by the Ministry of Finance (Annex G). Three of oblasts decided not to participate in the project. As a&#13;
consequence, the Loan amount was reduced from $300 to $270 million at negotiations. The Bank,&#13;
MOHMI, and MOE have agreed upon the final positive list of equipment and supplies eligible for&#13;
financing under the project as well as their detailed specifications. Orders for the first round of&#13;
procurement have been submitted by the 34 participating oblasts amounting to more than $220 million&#13;
of medical equipment and supplies. These orders have been consolidated and the draft bidding documents&#13;
prepared by a Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU) which has been operational since early&#13;
preparation financed by a Japanese Grant and by a Procurement Consultant appointed in December 1995&#13;
and financed by a PPF. The PPIU was formally established by MOF, MOHMI, and MOE prior to Loan&#13;
negotiations. The PPIU convened a meeting of the selected oblasts in September 1995 to review in detail&#13;
the terms and conditions of their participation in the project (Annex I) and to agree on a mechanism for&#13;
the timely payment of counterpart fund contributions. Twenty-nine of the participating oblasts have&#13;
provided MOF with letters confirming their intent to follow the conditions of participation; the five&#13;
remaining letters are expected shortly. Receipt of the letter of commitment is a condition of procurement&#13;
for each oblast. Therefore, the bidding documents-advertised in the April 26, 1996 issue of Izvestia and&#13;
the April 30, 1996 issue of Financial Times-will be released following submission of the pending letters.&#13;
It is expected that by the time of loan effectiveness, a significant proportion of the bidding packages&#13;
would be issued and evaluated and the contracts would be ready for signature.&#13;
B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
5.2          The proposed project, to be implemented over a two and one-half year period, would be&#13;
managed by the PPIU. Medical equipment to be provided under the project would be selected by the&#13;
beneficiary health care facilities in the participating oblasts from an agreed list. As a condition of&#13;
participation in the project, each of the participating regions are required to appoint a project coordinator&#13;
to organize the region's medical equipment orders, monitor and report on project implementation and&#13;
generally liaise with the PPIU (para. 7.2 (e)). The PPIU would be responsible for coordinating project&#13;
activities with the participating oblasts and relevant federal ministries, managing procurement, signing&#13;
contracts, authorizing disbursements, maintaining project accounts and complying with the reporting and&#13;
auditing requirements detailed in the Loan Agreement. A condition of Board presentation was agreement&#13;
of the MOF, MOE, and MOHMI on a Regulation (Annex H) which would establish the PPIU with&#13;
acceptable authority and responsibilities (para. 7.4). This condition has been met. The authority of the&#13;
PPIU to manage the project would be confirmed by the Government when it issues its internal decree on&#13;
the implementation of the project following loan signature.&#13;
5.3          A Procurement Consultant (consisting of a joint venture between a foreign and local&#13;
consulting firm) is assisting the PPIU to prepare bidding documents and would advertise specific bidding&#13;
opportunities, distribute bidding documents, evaluate bids, recommend contract awards and supervise the&#13;
work of the Consolidation and Forwarding Agent. A detailed work plan to this effect is included as an&#13;
attachment to the Procurement Consultant's Inception Report. The Consolidation and Forwarding Agent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 34                              Project Status, Implementation, Evaluation and Supervision&#13;
would be responsible for receiving and inspecting medical equipment, providing warehouse space and&#13;
insurance and ensuring the delivery of the equipment to the final users. Further details on the roles and&#13;
responsibilities of the PPIU, the Procurement Consultant and the Consolidation and Forwarding Agent&#13;
are included in the project implementation plan presented in Annex J.&#13;
5.4          The Ministries of Economy and of Health and Medical Industry have reviewed and&#13;
approved the positive list of medical equipment and supplies eligible for financing under the loan. MOE&#13;
and MOHMI would also review and approve the detailed specifications of the equipment to ensure that&#13;
the specifications meet applicable Russian standards and certification requirements. At negotiations, it&#13;
was agreed that equipment and supplies meeting the agreed specifications and requiring certification&#13;
would be reviewed by the authorized institutions on priority basis (para. 7.3 (b)). The certification&#13;
process should not take longer than four months to complete.&#13;
5.5          The PPIU would also work in conjunction with an inter-agency Working Group-headed&#13;
MOHMI and comprising representatives of the State Committee for Statistics (Goskomstat), MOF,&#13;
Ministry of Economy, the Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund and the State Tax Service-&#13;
established to coordinate the work on national health accounts.&#13;
C. REPORTING AND EVALUATiON&#13;
5.6          As a condition of participation, the participating oblasts are required to report periodically&#13;
on project implementation and equipment utilization (para. 7.2 (f)). The PPIU would submit monthly&#13;
progress reports to the Bank. These reports would be submitted fifteen days after the end of each month&#13;
following loan effectiveness. The format would be mutually agreed upon prior to the date of the first&#13;
submission and would be modified as necessary during the implementation of the project. In addition&#13;
to the monthly progress reports, an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be submitted to the&#13;
Bank by the PPIU promptly after the completion of the project but in any event not later than six months&#13;
after the loan closing date. Included in the ICR would be an assessment on the execution and initial&#13;
operation of the project, its costs and benefits derived or to be derived, the performance of the Borrower&#13;
and the Bank and other agencies involved regarding their respective obligations and accomplishments,&#13;
and lesson learned.&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
5.7          Because of the large number of facilities which are potentially eligible to participate in&#13;
the project (up to 700 hospitals and 10,000 polyclinics), the project proposes to monitor its impact on&#13;
development objectives by collecting utilization data, on a sample basis, for equipment delivered to each&#13;
of the participating oblasts and by establishing that all equipment has been delivered to and installed at&#13;
the designated sites. The sample utilization data would be transmitted from the selected beneficiary&#13;
facilities to the designated oblast coordinator who in turn would collect and provide the information to&#13;
the PPIU. The standard format for this report would be developed at the time of the project review&#13;
shortly after the completion of the first round of procurement and when the delivery of equipment begins.&#13;
At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would cause the participating oblasts to&#13;
install and utilize the provided medical equipment at the intended facilities (para. 7.2 (g)). The terms of&#13;
reference for the auditor engaged by the PPIU would include the responsibility to check, on a sample&#13;
basis, that equipment is installed at its intended facility and is in proper working order. Project&#13;
implementation would be monitored by tracking the volume of contracts awarded and signed, equipment&#13;
delivered and loan disbursements.&#13;

D. WORLD BANK SUPERVISION&#13;
5.8          Because of the compressed timetable for project implementation, intensive supervision&#13;
would be required, especially during the first year of implementation. Between 35 to 45 staff weeks and&#13;
three missions would, on average, be required each fiscal year to supervise project implementation.&#13;
Supervision missions would be staffed, as needed, by Bank staff and consultants knowledgeable in project&#13;
management, contract monitoring, biomedical engineering, procurement, and national health accounts.&#13;
Supervision requirements detailed in Annex K are based on the assumption that a strong, well staffed&#13;
PPIU would be in place throughout project implementation. At negotiations, the Government confirmed&#13;
that the PPIU would be adequately staffed and financed throughout the period of project implementation&#13;
(para. 7.3 (c)).&#13;
5.9          Following completion of the first round of bidding, a comprehensive review of the project&#13;
would be carried out to help the PPIU define the activities and timeframe required to complete project&#13;
implementation and create a detailed plan for completing the remaining procurement.&#13;
5.10         The Moscow Resident Mission would provide day-to-day support on processing&#13;
disbursement requests and other issues throughout the project implementation period.&#13;

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. PRnoJCr JUSFCATION&#13;
Framework&#13;
6.1           The proposed project is a component of the Bank's overall strategy for assisting the&#13;
Russian Federation as set out in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on June&#13;
6, 19953. The project directly supports the priority objective described in the CAS to moderate the&#13;
impact of the transition by, among other things, naintaining basic social services while improving the&#13;
efficiency of public expenditures. By upgrading the stock of equipment in basic health facilities, it&#13;
contributes directly to improving the quality of services in the beneficiary facilities. Purthermore, by&#13;
redirecting investments to primary and secondary care facilities-a change unlikely to take place without&#13;
the project, given historical patterns favoring highly-specialized inpatient facilities-it represents a first&#13;
step in undertaking the broader reforms that would make the health system more sustainable and cost-&#13;
effective in the long-run.&#13;
6.2          It is recognized that renewing the physical stock of basic facilities is only one measure&#13;
of many required to achieve the broader reform objective of improving health carein Russia. In addition&#13;
to this selective investment, the Russian health system would require, among other things: (i)&#13;
introduction of new payment mechanisms that create incentives for more efficient behavior by providers;&#13;
(ii) widespread retraining of providers to enable them to shift to more cost-effective and up-to-date&#13;
clinical practices, assume greater responsibility for their professional decisions, and understand the new&#13;
financing mechanisms that have been introduced under the ongoing health reform (see Chapter I, Sections&#13;
D and E); (iii) strengthening of public health programs to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent the non-&#13;
communicable diseases that constitute the largest components of the country's disease burden; and (iv)&#13;
gradual elimination of excess capacity in inpatient facilities. Each element of the package could,&#13;
individually, contribute to improving resource allocation and sustainability in the sector. However, the&#13;
full benefits of reform would be attained only with well-coordinated, fully integrated introduction of all&#13;
elements, a significantly more complex and long-term undertaking.&#13;
6.3           Although the above complementary measures are not a part of the project, the emerging&#13;
health policy environment in Russia would encourage, or at least enable, participating oblasts to undertake&#13;
them on their own initiative. Under the new Health Insurance Law, new performance-based provider&#13;
payment mechanisms have been legalized countrywide and many oblasts are initiating experimnents with&#13;
these payment systems, learning from experiments in the late 1980s in the oblasts of St. Petersburg,&#13;
Kemerovo and Samara. The practice of Family Medicine was authorized in 1992, and medical academies&#13;
in Moscow and St. Petersburg, among others, have started training Family Physicians, who will form&#13;
the core of the new generation of primary care providers able to provide greatly expanded services at this&#13;
level. A number of federal level institutes, including the Institute of Prevention and the Cardiology&#13;
Institute, are helping oblasts introduce new approaches to preventive care, although these changes have&#13;
so far focused more on preventive medicine as performed by caregivers in a health facility and less so&#13;
on community-based promotion. These various interventions require substantially less investment&#13;
financing than measures to upgrade and update the physical capital, and can generally be undertaken by&#13;
oblasts, at least on a limited basis, using their own resources.&#13;
3A CAS Progress Report was discussed with the Board on March 28, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 38                               Project Status, Implementation, Evaluation and Supervision&#13;
6.4           When the present project was conceived, a strategic choice was made to focus the range&#13;
of the interventions to investments in medical equipment, thus simplifying the project considerably. This&#13;
would allow broader geographic coverage and generate quick, visible results, an important consideration&#13;
for a first operation in a sector where full reform would take years, even decades to complete.&#13;
6.5           A second Bank operation for the health sector in Russia, the Health Reform Pilot Project&#13;
which was appraised in January 1996, would apply a more integrated approach to health reform at the&#13;
oblast level. That project involves a pilot experiment in two oblasts to: (i) test various forms of provider&#13;
incentives that encourage cost effective and cost-conscious service delivery; (ii) restructure the delivery&#13;
system with a strong emphasis on Family Physicians as primary care providers, and reduction in inpatient&#13;
capacity; and (iii) introduce approaches to management of maternal and child health and cardiovascular&#13;
disease that stress prevention and promotion. That project would also support national and regional&#13;
training programs in Family Medicine through the Moscow Medical Academy and organize activities to&#13;
monitor, evaluate and disseminate project results. In contrast with the present project, this more&#13;
comprehensive-and complex-approach to health reform has the disadvantage of very limited geographic&#13;
coverage and slower implementation. However, dissemination activities of the project are expected to&#13;
help transfer the knowledge and experience gained to other oblasts. Future Bank interventions in the&#13;
health sector in Russia will likely be a cross between the Health Reform Pilot Project and the present&#13;
project, with the broader reform agenda of the former but with wider geographic coverage, using the&#13;
methods for more flexible and quicker disbursement developed for the latter.&#13;
6.6           Beyond its contribution to health sector objectives, the project contributes to the&#13;
macroeconomic objective of improving budget management practices. By introducing a simple&#13;
mechanism for realizing federal transfers to oblasts in a manner that ties them to priority objectives in&#13;
one sector, this project could pave the way for broader application of tied transfers, with an element of&#13;
counterpart financing, that would replace the current practice of untied cash transfers to oblasts. These&#13;
cash transfers are widely seen as an inefficient use of federal resources, and a lost opportunity to&#13;
encourage oblasts to allocate public resources to national priorities in a wide range of sectors.&#13;
Project Design Features&#13;
6.7           The project is an exceptionally simple, quick-disbursing investment operation that&#13;
nevertheless retains features that ensure that: (i) selection of investments is consistent with priority&#13;
sectoral objectives; (ii) oblasts and health facilities are actively involved in project implementation and&#13;
finance; (iii) procurement is organized in such a way as to maximize economies of scale.&#13;
6.8           Selection of Investments. The project guarantees consistency with sectoral priorities&#13;
through the use of a positive list of equipment to be purchased and by limiting access to project resources&#13;
to specific types of facilities. In formulating the positive list, both the present situation in the Russian&#13;
Federation in terms of epidemiology (mainly the morbidity and mortality structure) and the organization&#13;
of the existing health care system were taken into consideration. The selected equipment would enable&#13;
health care facilities to deal more effectively in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease, trauma&#13;
and cancer, the highest priority health problems identified by analysis of epidemiological data. Equipment&#13;
to be provided would support screening programs and simple treatment procedures to address these&#13;
diseases.&#13;
6.9           By targeting the project to primary and selected secondary level facilities, support is being&#13;
directed to the most cost effective institutions which have been disadvantaged by less resource allocation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                              Page 39&#13;
in recent years.4 Federal, tertiary and highly specialized institutions have been excluded from the project&#13;
because of: (i) the need for strengthening capacity for early health care interventions and out-patient&#13;
services provided mainly in primary and secondary regional institutions; (ii) the greater share of capital&#13;
expenditures historically provided to federal and tertiary care providers has left them better equipped&#13;
relative to other levels; and (iii) they serve a smaller proportion of the population at relatively high costs.&#13;
6.10           Directing needed equipment to lower level facilities is expected to have additional benefits&#13;
by reducing dependence on tertiary and specialized facilities, thereby allowing selective downsizing of&#13;
these more expensive facilities and shifting capacity into services not currently offered or undersupplied.&#13;
Indirectly this serves to improve the quality of health care throughout the system.&#13;
6.11           Cost effectiveness of the specific investments has been ensured by including on the&#13;
equipment list only those items which are both high priority in terms of enabling the target facilities to&#13;
meet their mandate for provision of services and the most cost effective in diagnosing and treating patients&#13;
given the epidemiological profile in Russia.&#13;
6.12           Local Involvement. In keeping with the recent move to decentralized management of&#13;
health services, the project introduces opportunities for local authorities to participate in implementation,&#13;
while sharing responsibility for project financing. Although oblast-wide allocations out of project funds&#13;
are determined at the federal level, the choice of participating facilities and their respective allocations&#13;
are determined by oblast authorities, within the predetermined selection guidelines. Managers of selected&#13;
facilities then make the choice as to how their respective allocations are used for specific items of&#13;
equipment, chosen from the positive list for the entire project. In return, oblasts are expected to&#13;
contribute 10 percent of base costs of the project and finance all taxes and duties due on the equipment,&#13;
and ensure sufficient budgets for supplies needed to operate the equipment.&#13;
6.13           Organization  of Procurement.   Following  decentralization  of health  services&#13;
management, responsibility for procurement of medical equipment has been delegated to the individual&#13;
facility. Under these arrangements, opportunities for pooling resources to gain price advantages on larger&#13;
orders have been lost. The project introduces a mechanism for pooling resources for procurement which&#13;
could be continued beyond the life of the project if it proves to generate important cost savings.&#13;
6.14           The introduction of standard international competitive bidding procedures is also an&#13;
important innovation in Russia. Although the Bank's requirement to apply competitive procurement&#13;
procedures met initially with strong resistance, MOHMI and other federal authorities now appear to&#13;
recognize that the interests of the health care delivery system needs to be viewed separately from those&#13;
of the medical industry. It is hoped that the infusion of considerable resources for the purchase of&#13;
equipment as well as the experience of competing with international suppliers will benefit the national&#13;
industry in the long run.&#13;
Summary of Benefits&#13;
6.15           The most immediate impact of the project would be to increase the availability, range and&#13;
quality of services provided by the participating primary health care facilities and raion hospitals. Over&#13;
1200 facilities in 34 oblasts with a total population of 63.1 million (43 percent of the Russian population)&#13;
' Certain secondary level institutions (eg. district hospitals) are also excluded because in some instance they are poorly&#13;
staffed, provide low quality care and are not deemed priorities for new equipment. Many of these facilides will likely be closed&#13;
or redeployed in the course of subsequent restructuring and rationalization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 40                                Project Status, Implementation, Evaluation and Supervision&#13;
would participate in the project. Moreover, the preponderance of primary and secondary facilities under&#13;
the project are located in relatively remote areas, serving a population that has in general received less&#13;
attention and poorer quality care. Hence, a further consequence of the project would be directing a&#13;
greater share of health care resources to less well-serviced districts within oblasts, helping more&#13;
vulnerable communities to gain access to quality care. Moving health care services down to primary and&#13;
secondary institutions will also facilitate ease of access and reduce associated costs (transport, time, etc.),&#13;
particularly for more remote towns and villages.&#13;
6.16          One of the project's more important benefits would be in creating the potential for more&#13;
significant benefits in the medium and long term as changes introduced by the project are built upon to&#13;
implement more comprehensive structural reforms. These longer term benefits of the project arise from&#13;
both diversifying sources of diagnostic and treatment services and shifting provision from inpatient&#13;
towards outpatient care. Major cost savings can be achieved if complementary steps are taken to reduce&#13;
the number of hospital beds and close tertiary care facilities which have been maintained through a system&#13;
excessively focussed on tertiary and specialized care.5 This project does not directly provide for such&#13;
restructuring, but will serve to shift orientation of health delivery and create an environment more&#13;
conducive to more systemic restructuring in five to ten years time.&#13;
6.17          As a further benefit the loan would also finance the creation of national health accounts.&#13;
A system of national health accounts is considered essential both to administering a national health system&#13;
and to effectively monitoring budget execution by national and regional authorities. It allows the&#13;
Government to monitor health expenditures in a detailed and timely manner, providing valid data for the&#13;
planning and management of health insurance and health care finance.&#13;
B. PROJECT RIs&#13;
6.18          Because of the project's simple design and structure, the considerable risks often identified&#13;
with complex health projects are avoided. The specific project risks relate mainly to the coordination and&#13;
implementation activities including including procurement and the logistics of delivering and installing&#13;
equipment in more than 1200 facilities-each with its unique selection of equipment-in 34 oblasts located&#13;
accross the 11 time zones of the Russian Federation. To avoid delays in implementation, a PPIU was&#13;
established and staffed early during preparation, and is being strengthened as the volume of project&#13;
activities increases. A procurement consulting firm was also engaged early, initially financed by a Project&#13;
Preparation Facility. The use of eight regional warehouses as intermediate delivery points and the&#13;
planned engagement of a consolidating and forwarding agent would address the logistical problem.&#13;
Agreement was reached with Government during negotiations that equipment meeting the agreed&#13;
specifications which require certification should be approved on an accelerated timeframe. This should&#13;
also expedite project implementation.&#13;
6.19          The achievement of project objectives is also contingent upon the availability of spare&#13;
parts, consumable supplies, and personnel trained in the use and maintenance of the equipment provided.&#13;
The risk that these requirements might not be met has been mitigated by the following features of the&#13;
project design: (a) a one year supply of consumables will be provided with all items of equipment&#13;
requiring such supplies; (b) participating oblasts will give an undertaking that the necessary resources will&#13;
' Based on the most cost-effective health care delivery experiences in OECD countries, it is estimated that there is scope&#13;
in the Russian health care system for reducing the cost of hospital care by up to 50 percent and the number of physicians by&#13;
up to 40 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                         Page 41&#13;
be provided to cover the cost of supplies in subsequent years; (c) participating facilities will be monitored&#13;
to ensure that equipment is installed in the facility for which it was ordered and that it is being utilized;&#13;
(d) in parallel with ordering equipment requiring skilled operators, participating facilities must designate&#13;
and certify the appropriate training of the operator; and (e) equipment suppliers would be required to&#13;
provide training on operating and maintaining the equipment supplied.&#13;
6.20          Finally, review of the project tentatively scheduled for late 1996 following completion&#13;
of the first round of procurement, would elaborate the activities and timing required to complete project&#13;
implementation in a timely and efficient manner.&#13;

Annex C: National Health Accounts&#13;
1.    Establishing a system of national health accounts is of critical importance to the development of&#13;
health policy in Russia during the current period of economic transition and beyond. Such a system&#13;
would provide adequate data to support analyses, not only of the structure and utilization of the resources&#13;
of the health care system, but also of the options being considered to reform the system of health care&#13;
financing.&#13;
2.     The term "national health accounts" refers to an accounting framework for health care spending&#13;
which classifies total health spending by source of funding and types of expenditure to which that funding&#13;
was applied. Such a framework is required to effectively plan and manage health programs; determine&#13;
appropriate resource allocations both within the health sector and among health and other sectors; evaluate&#13;
the causes of changes in health status; and facilitate comparisons with health care systems in other&#13;
countries. In most industrialized countries, national health accounts are prepared annually and serve as&#13;
one of the major tools supporting the development of health policy.&#13;
3.     Up to 1991, the vast majority of financial resources for health sector in Russia were provided&#13;
either by direct budgetary allocations through the Ministry of Health or indirect allocations through some&#13;
21 other agencies/ministries which operated health facilities for their employees and dependents in parallel&#13;
to those available to the general public. Accordingly, the normal budgetary reporting mechanisms were&#13;
able to capture the bulk of health spending by type of facility. With the subsequent decentralization of&#13;
the responsibility for health sector financing to the oblast level and introduction of the system of&#13;
compulsory health insurance, tracking of health expenditures has become increasingly complicated. As&#13;
the Government considers expanding the range of services for which full or partial payment is required&#13;
from patients, the prevalence of private voluntary health insurance increases, and private health care&#13;
providers enter the market, an increasing share of health financing is likely to be provided from non-&#13;
budgetary sources; the existing system of reporting on health financing will capture a decreasing share&#13;
of total expenditures.&#13;
4.    As the Government reviews options for restructuring health care in Russia, either by introducing&#13;
new structures and organizations for the delivery of health care services or by introducing new health&#13;
financing mechanisms, the information on sources and utilization of funds by the health care system will&#13;
be an important analytical tool supporting informed decisions. At present, budgetary resources, both&#13;
federal and territorial, and funds channeled through the mandatory health insurance system comprise the&#13;
two major sources of health financing. Other sources include enterprise spending either on direct&#13;
provision or procurement of health services for their employees, extra-budgetary funds and household&#13;
expenditures for items such as outpatient pharmaceuticals. It is estimated that budgetary allocations for&#13;
health plus the funds provided under the mandatory health insurance system may account for as much as&#13;
90 percent of total health spending in Russia. At present, good quality, comprehensive data exist on both&#13;
of these sources but the data are not compiled in a framework that facilitates analysis. In addition, less&#13;
detailed information on health spending by enterprises and extra-budgetary funds is reported to&#13;
Goskomstat, but these data are also not compiled in a way that would facilitate analysis.&#13;
5.    Russia has long collected and maintained a very comprehensive data base on health status and&#13;
capacity indicators. Annual reports are prepared by the oblast health departments and forwarded to the&#13;
Ministry of Health and Medical Industry for consolidation and analysis. The consensus among local&#13;
experts is that the existing reporting mechanisms could be modified to support the compilation of national&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 52                                   Annex C: Development of National Health Accounts&#13;
health accounts. As the system of reporting to MOHMI is already well established, it appears to be most&#13;
practical to enhance this system. The incremental effort should be minimal. However, consensus among&#13;
local experts is that voluntary reporting is unlikely to work in the Russian context, as existing statistical&#13;
reporting systems are all based on mandatory reporting. Health financing data would need to be collected&#13;
from each facility and aggregated at the usual levels, i.e., by oblast and federation wide.&#13;
6.    Because of the nature of the this task, which would cut across ministries and might eventually&#13;
create the need for additional mandatory statistical reporting on the part of both public and private&#13;
entities, a governmental decree sanctioning this work [would be] required. The decree [is] a condition&#13;
of negotiations of the proposed project. Compiling and publishing national health accounts on a regular&#13;
basis would involve the participation and collaboration of a number of stakeholders.&#13;
Stakeholders&#13;
7.    Ministry of Health and Medical Industry (MOHMI). MOHMI has an established reporting&#13;
structure with all health care providers. Although at present the data collected relates primarily to health&#13;
status and the capacity of facilities, it is anticipated that the most efficient means of obtaining the primary&#13;
data for national health accounts would be to mandate that all health care providers also report on their&#13;
sources of funding.&#13;
8.    State Committee for Statistics (Goskomstat). The role of Goskomstat would be primarily be&#13;
that of technical advisor. They would play a key role in helping to design the survey instrument&#13;
circulated by MOHMI and would develop mechanisms for cross-checking the primary data with data&#13;
collected in conjunction with compilation of the national income and product accounts.&#13;
9.    Ministry of Finance (MOF). The consolidated budget (federal, territorial and municipal/local)&#13;
still provides the bulk of health sector financing in Russia. So long as the health care system in Russia&#13;
remains mostly publicly financed, the executed budget reports, which are submitted annually to MOF,&#13;
provide another important source of information on health spending. These data would be used as&#13;
primary data until a detailed provider reporting mechanism is implemented and, thereafter, to assess the&#13;
reliability of data collected by health care providers reporting directly to MOHMI.&#13;
10.   Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (FMHIF). The second most important source of&#13;
health sector financing comes from the 3.6 percent earmarked payroll tax collected by the Territorial&#13;
Health Insurance Funds (THIFs). The THIFs submit quarterly and annual reports to the FMHIF which&#13;
will serve as a primary source of data until the detailed provider reporting mechanism can be&#13;
implemented.&#13;
11.   State Tax Service. Income tax returns of enterprises may serve as a source of data on health&#13;
spending by commercial (i.e., non-budgetary) enterprises, again as a primary data source in the near-term&#13;
and as a secondary source once a provider reporting system is in effect.&#13;
12.   Local Consultants. It has been proposed that the most expedient way to complete the design&#13;
work required to create a system of national health accounts would be to establish a task force staffed by&#13;
local consultants who are able to devote full time to this task. The task force would be guided by a&#13;
Steering Committee comprising representatives of all of the relevant agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                     Page 53&#13;
13.   Foreign Consultants. Foreign consultants would also be employed as needed to provide advice&#13;
and guidance on specific technical issues. A partial list of technical issues which must be addressed is&#13;
presented below.&#13;
National Health Accounts Format&#13;
14.   A preliminary format (attached) for national health accounts for Russia has been designed with&#13;
the assistance of local and foreign experts. The proposed format suggests an accounting system which&#13;
reflects the current configuration of the Russian health care system and the data reporting format which&#13;
is familiar to health care institutions.&#13;
15.   For types of health care spending, the rows of the table include:&#13;
a.    ten types of personal health care spending (1.1 through 1.10) which correspond to the&#13;
line items in the executed budget reports submitted by oblasts plus pharmaceuticals&#13;
(1.11), which appear to capture most personal consumption of health care goods and&#13;
services in the Russian system;&#13;
b.    five types of public health service spending (2.1 through 2.5) which also correspond to&#13;
line items in the territorial Executed Budget Reports and which capture the variety of&#13;
public health activities;&#13;
c.    medical research (3.0); and&#13;
d.    capital investments related to health care.&#13;
16.   This presentation was developed to reflect the existing structure of the health care system in&#13;
Russia. In addition, consideration should be given to including additional categories which may be&#13;
expected to represent and increasing share of health services provided in the future.&#13;
Issues&#13;
17.   Sources of Funding: Accrued debt as a source of payment for health care services - Actual&#13;
budgeted payments for incurred expenses related to health care services may be supplemented from time&#13;
to time by proceeds from short-term loans in order to pay incurred expenses not covered by actual budget&#13;
payments. Alternatively, actual budgeted amounts may exceed actual incurred expenses related to health&#13;
care services and this surplus budget amount may be used to retire loans previously incurred in periods&#13;
of budget shortfalls. Since the health accounts focus on incurred expenses for health services and sources&#13;
of funds used to finance those expenses in a particular time period, it would be preferable to include the&#13;
actual expenses incurred by type(s) of expenditure, the actual budgeted amount spent for the type(s) of&#13;
expenditure as one source of payment and any funding by proceeds from loans as a separate source of&#13;
funding (perhaps categorized as "Other") in the accounts. On the principle that the accounts should show&#13;
incurred amounts rather than cash flow amounts, any future surplus budget amounts that are not spent&#13;
on current expenses for health care but are used to retire loans would not be shown in the accounts.&#13;
18.   Types of Expenditures:&#13;
a.    Capital expenditures - Purchases of medical equipment (chapter 12 in the Executed&#13;
Budget Report) appear under each facilities category as a recurrent expense. Under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 54                                   Annex C: Development of National Health Accounts&#13;
generally accepted international accounting principles, these expenditures would be&#13;
counted as a recurrent expenses if they comprise relatively minor repairs or if they had&#13;
an expected life of less than one year, but would be counted as a capital expenditure if&#13;
the equipment had an expected life of one year or more. Durable medical equipment&#13;
(that is, with an expected life of one year or longer) should be reported under the&#13;
investment category in NHA.&#13;
b.    Construction of health facilities - Capital investments (paragraphs 140 in the Executed&#13;
Budget Report) should comprehensively include both buildings and fixed (that is, attached&#13;
to the building) medical equipment.&#13;
c.    Pharmaceuticals - Spending on outpatient pharmaceuticals may well be the most&#13;
significant item of household spending on health at the present time. Accordingly, it&#13;
would appear to warrant reporting as a separate category of expenditure. In order to&#13;
fully count total spending on pharmaceuticals, the amounts spent by hospitals and&#13;
ambulatory facilities would have to be deducted from these categories and added to the&#13;
pharmaceuticals category. Information on total turnover provided to the State Tax&#13;
Service might serve as one source of data for this category. However, retail pharmacies&#13;
may sell to both individual patients and institutions. Care must be taken to avoid double&#13;
counting of the pharmaceutical subsidies paid by polyclinics to retail pharmacies on&#13;
behalf of patients who are entitled to discounts (children, veterans, the elderly, diabetics,&#13;
etc.). In the OECD, Canadian and U.S. health accounts, the cost of pharmaceuticals&#13;
consumed during institutional care (e.g. by hospitals or ambulatory facilities) is included&#13;
as institutional care and is not counted separately as a pharmaceutical type of expenditure.&#13;
Only prescription drugs or non-prescription drugs (i.e. self-medication drugs) sold by&#13;
retail outlets (e.g. a pharmacy) are included as a separate pharmaceutical expense in the&#13;
accounts.&#13;
d.    Financial reserves of health insurance funds and health insurance companies -&#13;
Health accounts in some OECD countries, Canada and the U.S. display the difference&#13;
between incurred insurance premiums paid to private insurance companies (that is, non-&#13;
governmental insurance funds) and incurred benefits payable. The amount includes costs&#13;
for administration of the private health insurance plan and any net additions to (or&#13;
subtractions from) to health insurance reserves. In the U.S., regulation of private health&#13;
insurance reserves is usually under the jurisdiction of the states rather than the federal&#13;
government. The amounts for private health insurance administrative costs and net&#13;
additions to (or subtractions from) insurance reserves are added to administrative costs&#13;
for government insurance programs and reported in the health accounts as either "health&#13;
administration" or "prepayment administration." Territorial Health Insurance Funds and&#13;
private (voluntary) health insurance companies in Russia have also been accumulating&#13;
reserves and investing in the local securities market.&#13;
e.    Medical education is included as a type of health spending in national health accounts&#13;
in several of the OECD countries. The United States, however, does not include the&#13;
aggregate cost of medical education in its national health accounts. If Russia chooses to&#13;
include medical education, a primary data source would need to be identified.&#13;
f.    Federal Programs - It has been suggested that federal programs for health (for&#13;
example, maternal and child health, emergency medical care, etc.) might be presented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                   Page 55&#13;
as a separate expenditure category. In fact, these programs actually represent one of the&#13;
forms of direct federal budgetary support and the related expenditures would be for the&#13;
purchase of medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, support to specific hospitals or clinics,&#13;
etc. Accordingly, federal programs for health would appear as a source of funding under&#13;
the federal budget column of the national health accounts format, and expenditures would&#13;
be distributed over the categories for which the funds were actually used.&#13;
g.    Orphanages - One principal objective of the health accounts is to focus on spending&#13;
that relates primarily to health care. The boundaries between some types of social&#13;
welfare spending and health care spending are sometimes not clearly defined. For&#13;
example, although minimal health care may be provided in orphanages, the primary type&#13;
of care is custodial. Thus, spending for orphanages is excluded in most countries' health&#13;
accounts. The appropriateness of including orphanages in Russia's NHA needs to be&#13;
evaluated.&#13;
h.    Other long-term care - As noted above, custodial care is excluded from health care&#13;
spending in most countries' national health accounts. If the funding provided by off-&#13;
budget social funds includes such items as homes for the elderly or the poor which do&#13;
not include a significant component of nursing or other health care, consideration should&#13;
be given to excluding these amounts.&#13;
.     Terrltorial health networks -  Although the prevalence of this experiment with&#13;
integrated delivery systems is declining, territorial health authorities continue to report&#13;
expenditures in this category. In 1991, for example, 12 percent of health spending was&#13;
attributable to territorial health nietworks. If the amount continues to be significant, a&#13;
mechanism should be developed for estimating the amount of such spending attributable&#13;
to hospitals versus the amount spent for ambulatory care.&#13;
j.     Central bookkeeping and howebeeplng services are not in and of themselves health&#13;
services. Therefore, a methodology should be developed for allocating the costs of&#13;
budgetary spending on these categories to specific service groups.&#13;
k.    Administrative Expens - The administrative expenses incurred by specific health care&#13;
facilities would be included in their financial reports to MOHMI. However, the&#13;
administrative expenses of the FMHIF, THIFs and private insurers need to be captured.&#13;
19.   Other Isue.:&#13;
a.    Anidipated reforms - Any significant reforms expected in the types of health care&#13;
services provided (ie. introduction of free-standing family practitioners, private facilities,&#13;
etc.) should be considered and accommodated in the health accounts format.&#13;
Consideration should also be give to how related expenditures would be measured.&#13;
b.    National vs. regional health accounts - Although national health accounts are of&#13;
paramount importance, regional health spending estimates may provide important&#13;
information to policy makers which is not apparent in the national estimates. Two key&#13;
issues that emerge from regional analyses of health spending are:&#13;
L.    variations in health spending per capita among regions. Significant&#13;
disparities may require further analyses of health budget allocations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 56                                   Annex C: Development of National Health Accounts&#13;
and/or availability of health care resources, important considerations in&#13;
preserving equal access to comparable levels of health care.&#13;
ii.    variations in health care practices among regions. Significant disparities&#13;
in health spending by type of health provider may point to the need for&#13;
further analyses of distributions of the various types of health care&#13;
providers and/or variations in practices of health care providers in&#13;
different regions. Such variations in health care practices may indicate&#13;
more (or less) efficient use of health care resources, thus providing&#13;
models of health care that might be adopted (or avoided) elsewhere.&#13;
A potential difficulty in preparing regional health spending estimates is that the types of&#13;
information available at the federal level may not be available at the regional level.&#13;
c.    Adding a third dimension for expenditure data on inputs - The Executed Budget&#13;
Reports provide a breakdown of expenditures by input type (e.g., wages, food, etc.) and&#13;
type of service (e.g., hospitals, polyclinics). Consideration should be given to whether&#13;
collecting these data, when available, would be useful in terms of policy analysis. If so,&#13;
the system should be initially designed to include it, even if not available for all types of&#13;
service.&#13;
d.    Price deflators -  If good quality price deflators are not currently available for&#13;
converting nominal health spending into real spending in order to facilitate comparisons&#13;
over time, the process of developing national health accounts would provide a good&#13;
opportunity to fill this important gap.&#13;
e.    Time series - One of the major benefits of developing a comprehensive system of&#13;
national health accounts is to facilitate comparisons over time. Even though some prior&#13;
year data would not be totally comprehensive, consideration should be given to compiling&#13;
whatever data are available in the national health accounts format from 1985 to the&#13;
present date.&#13;
20.   Based on the advice and conunents of local experts, a two-pronged approach involving&#13;
compilation of existing data in parallel with the development of a more comprehensive system of data&#13;
collection on health financing, is recommended. The proposed approach is based on the understanding&#13;
that at present the Ministry of Finance has access to all budgetary data (both federal and territorial) except&#13;
for certain strategic agencies, such as the Ministries of Defense and Interior. Another significant data&#13;
base is maintained by the Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund. Goskomstat has access to less&#13;
detailed data on enterprise spending for health as well as expenditures from certain extra-budgetary funds.&#13;
21.   The proposed approach would involve compiling existing data for recent years in national health&#13;
accounts format and then improving the comprehensiveness of the data each year from 1996 to 1998 by&#13;
including data which are currently not readily available. The proposed scheme would represent an&#13;
evolutionary approach as follows:&#13;
1995 - compile existing data, beginning with 1994 in national health accounts format, creating&#13;
a time series back to 1985&#13;
1996 - compile 1995 data, including strategic ministries and agencies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                   Page 57&#13;
1997 - comnpile data for 1996 from all sources included in 1995 reporting, but based on direct&#13;
surveys of health facilities&#13;
1998 - compile data for 1997 based on new national health accounts methodology&#13;
A more detailed action program with a specific timetable would be agreed upon during negotiations.&#13;

Dear Sirs,&#13;
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation together with other interested ministries is&#13;
preparing a project on delivering medical equipment to particular health facilities in regions selected on&#13;
the basis of objective criteria which would be financed from an IBRD loan of US$ 300 million.&#13;
The intent is to use the loan funds for budgetary support of the health sector in regions in 1996-&#13;
1997.&#13;
The main objective of the project is to improve the operation of town and raion polyclinics,&#13;
women's consultations, feldsher stations, raion hospitals and maternity homes by providing them with&#13;
medical instruments and modem medical equipment to reorient service delivery toward outpatient care.&#13;
To coordinate the work of all organizations participating in preparation and implementation of&#13;
the project, a Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU) has been established. It operates on&#13;
the basis of the Regulations on PPIUs.&#13;
After assessing the state of medical service delivery system in the Russian Federation a&#13;
preliminary list of regions, which are intended to receive loan financing, was defined. Your region is on&#13;
this list.&#13;
Participating regions would be able to select from proposed lists of equipment for above&#13;
mentioned facilities. Necessary consumables are included to complement the equipment to be provided.&#13;
Training of medical and technical staff in use of the supplied equipment and instruments would also be&#13;
included in the project.&#13;
The project could also provide spare parts for existing equipment in any health facilities.&#13;
In order to participate in the project you should fulfill the following conditions:&#13;
1.    counterpart funding from the region budget up to 30% of the project costs to finance&#13;
transportation and storage costs inside the country, and expenditures due to the payment of possible&#13;
custom duties and taxes if there are any at the time of deliveries;&#13;
2.    the supplied equipment should be utilized strictly in the identified medical facilities which&#13;
will be listed by the region in its equipment orders. Regions will be expected to report on utilization of&#13;
the equipment for up to two years after delivery and installation;&#13;
3.    up to delivery time, premises for installation of equipment should be prepared, medical&#13;
and technical personnel should be selected, and conditions for training in use and maintenance of the&#13;
supplied equipment should be provided;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 66                   Annex G: Letter to Participating Regions from the Ministry of Finance&#13;
4.    ensure that during the specified period the region will finance from its budget purchases&#13;
of consumables and technical services required for normal operation of the supplied equipment; and&#13;
5.    to coordinate project implementation, the regional authorities would appoint a coordinator&#13;
who will work in close cooperation with the project preparation and implementation unit. The&#13;
coordinator would submit to the PPIU semiannually reports on relevant local staff training, operations&#13;
of the equipment and other aspects of the project under PPIU's requirements during two years after&#13;
installation.&#13;
Attached to this letter are preliminary equipment lists. Later on you will receive detailed&#13;
specifications and forms to fill in orders. Because it is important to involve head doctors and leading&#13;
specialists of the facilities receiving equipment, a sufficient number of forms will be provided, so that&#13;
each facility can place its own order.&#13;
You will receive additional information on how the counterpart funding will be organized.&#13;
Loan funds in the amount of US$_ million would be allocated to your region as budgetary&#13;
support and would not have to be repaid.&#13;
To discuss in detail questions connected with the project, the PPIU is going to arrange a&#13;
conference with representatives of the regions confirming their participation in the project in Moscow in&#13;
August.&#13;
Please notify the Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (Victor Pastoukhov, Director, tel.&#13;
(095) 246-7970, fax (095) 246-1537, address: Room 301, 3/5 Smolensky Blvd., Moscow) about your&#13;

Annex J: Project Implementation Plan&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.            The proposed project is designed to: (a) increase the availability, range and quality of&#13;
services provided by primary health care facilities and raion hospitals; (b) reorient service delivery toward&#13;
more cost effective health care; (c) decentralize decision making for capital investments to the facility&#13;
level; and (d) provide support for policy development in the health sector, by introducing a system of&#13;
national health accounts.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTON&#13;
2.            The proposed project would have three components: (a) medical equipment; (b) national&#13;
health accounts; and (c) project management.&#13;
Medical Equipment (US$300.0 million of total project costs)&#13;
3.            The project would address the lack of equipment in primary (polyclinics, women's clinics&#13;
and feldsher stations) and secondary (raion hospitals and maternity homes) health care facilities in 34&#13;
selected oblasts. Providing medical equipment to these facilities would increase the availability and range&#13;
of health services they are able to provide and would contribute to providing more cost effective diagnosis&#13;
and treatment. In the past, such facilities have been neglected in favor of more sophisticated facilities&#13;
such as oblast hospitals. This intervention would de facto redirect a significant part of the health sector&#13;
investment budget to lower level, more cost effective providers. Health care facilities in participating&#13;
oblasts will select equipment from an agreed list prepared to reflect the responsibilities and functions of&#13;
the facilities. To help ensure that the equipment would be fully utilized, the project would also finance&#13;
necessary consumnable supplies, technical training in the operation and maintenance of the machines, and&#13;
clinical training in the use of the more complex equipment.&#13;
Natdonal Health Accounts (US$3.0 milion of total project costs)&#13;
4.            With decentralization of the responsibility for health sector financing and the introduction&#13;
of mandatory health insurance in 1993, tracking of health expenditures has become increasingly&#13;
complicated.  The lack of reliable data on sources and uses of health finance has been a major&#13;
inpediment to the development of health sector policy during the economic transition. Accurate and&#13;
timely information on health expenditures is imnportant for many'reasons. It is an essential element in&#13;
providing the analytical framework that is needed to effectively plan and manage health programs;&#13;
determiine appropriate resource allocations both within the health sector and among health and other&#13;
sectors; evaluate the causes of changes in health status; and facilitate comparisons with health care&#13;
systems in other countries.&#13;
5.            The project would provide the necessary support to develop and implement a system of&#13;
national health accounts for Russia. This component would complement ongoing work financed under&#13;
an IDF grant to improve the quality of national income and product accounts for Russia. The approach&#13;
that would be followed is to develop a framework for national health accounts which is comparable to&#13;
those used in other industrialized countries but which respects the existing statistical reporting conventions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 76                                               Annex J: Project Implementation Plan&#13;
in Russia, inventory the sources of data that are currently available, arrange for existing data to be&#13;
compiled into NHA format by a designated agency (most likely MOHMI), identify gaps in available data&#13;
and propose least cost methods for obtaining the required data. The proposed loan would finance&#13;
consultant services for survey design and data collection, computer hardware and software to support this&#13;
effort and study tours of NHA systems in OECD countries.&#13;
Project Management (US$2.0 million of total project costs)&#13;
6.           A Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU) has been established as an agent&#13;
of the Ministry of Finance to administer and manage the proposed project. The PPIU would continue&#13;
in existence through project implementation to loan closing and would then be disbanded. The proposed&#13;
loan would finance the operating costs of the PPIU, including salaries of long-term consultancy staff,&#13;
office accommodation, supplies and equipment, utilities, staff travel and training, and consultant services.&#13;
Although the PPIU would not continue as an ongoing institution after project completion, staff trained&#13;
in procurement and project management would likely be absorbed into other institutions requiring these&#13;
skills and would continue to contribute to the successful inplementation of the Government's investment&#13;
program.&#13;
C. IMLEMENTATION RISKS&#13;
7.           Risks of delays in project implementation would be mitigated by the fact that a PPIU has&#13;
already been established and the staffing of the PPIU would be strengthened as the volume of project&#13;
activities increases. A procurement consultant has already been appointed and it is expected that contracts&#13;
would be ready to be signed around the time of loan effectiveness. Agreement will be reached with&#13;
MOHMI during negotiations that equipment meeting the agreed specifications which require certification&#13;
should be approved on an accelerated timeframe. This should expedite project implementation. A review&#13;
of the project tentatively scheduled for late 1996 following completion of the first round of procurement,&#13;
would elaborate the activities and timing required to complete project implementation in a timely and&#13;
efficient manner.&#13;
D. IMPLEMENTAToN ARRANGEmENTS&#13;
8.           The PPIU would be responsible for ensuring that the Agreement between the Government&#13;
and the World Bank would be carried out in a efficient and effective manner. Included would be&#13;
coordination among the various participating agencies to ensure a common and consistent approach in the&#13;
implementation of the project. Particular attention would be given to the carrying out of the agreed&#13;
procurement procedures while maintaining a very stringent schedule. Other responsibilities of the PPIU&#13;
would include administration of the Special Account, overall accounting and auditing of project accounts,&#13;
preparation of coordinated monthly and mid-term progress reports and a final Implementation Completion&#13;
Report.&#13;
9.           To assist the PPIU in the timely preparation and implementation of the project: (a) local&#13;
experts (consultants) would provide assistance as needed to develop or critique equipment specifications&#13;
and to provide other support as required; (b) a procurement consulting firm, financed initially under a&#13;
PPF, would assist the PPIU in all aspects of the administration of the procurement goods and related&#13;
services; and (c) each participating oblast would designate a liaison officer to specifically represent them&#13;
in all matters involving the implementation of their particular sub-component to ensure the timely and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Russian Federation: Medical Equipment Project                                      Page 77&#13;
satisfactory completion of the project. These liaison officers, located in each participating oblast, would&#13;
be responsible for representing the end-users in their respective oblast and would be responsible for&#13;
coordinating with the PPIU in all aspects of project implementation as appropriate to that particular&#13;
oblast.&#13;
10.           The PPIU would also work in conjunction with an inter-agency Working Group-headed&#13;
MOHMI and comprising representatives of the State Committee for Statistics (Goskomstat), MOF,&#13;
Ministry of Economy, the Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund and the State Tax Service-&#13;
established to coordinate the work on national health accounts.&#13;
Project Preparadon and Implementation Unit (PPIU)&#13;
11.           The PPIU has been established as an agent of the Ministry of Finance. Initial funding&#13;
from a grant from the Government of Japan and from a Project Preparation Facility will finance the PPIU&#13;
through the project preparation phase; the PPIU's costs during the implementation phase of the project&#13;
would be financed out of the proposed loan.&#13;
12.           The Director of the PPIU would be responsible for the administration of the project and&#13;
would act on behalf of the Government in all routine matters including the signing of contracts and&#13;
requests for authorized payments/withdrawals from the Loan proceeds and the Project Account.&#13;
13.          In addition to the Director, key staff of the PPIU would consist of: (a) a procurement&#13;
officer, who would assist the Director in the day to day management of the unit and would serve as the&#13;

F. MoNrroR]NG AND EVALUATION&#13;
Development Impact Indicators&#13;
24.           Because of the large number of facilities which are potentially eligible to participate in&#13;
the project (up to 700 hospitals and 10,000 polyclinics), the project proposes to monitor its impact on&#13;
development objectives by collecting utilization data, on a sample basis, for equipment delivered to each&#13;
of the participating oblasts and by establishing that all equipment has been delivered to and installed at&#13;
the designated sites. The sample utilization data would be transmitted from the selected beneficiary&#13;
facilities to the designated oblast coordinator who in turn would collect and provide the information to&#13;
the PPIU. The standard format for this report would be developed at the time of the project launch&#13;
workshop shortly after Board approval and the issuance of the tenders for the first round of procurement.&#13;
The terms of reference for the auditor engaged by the PPIU would include the responsibility to check,&#13;
on a sample basis, that equipment is installed at its intended facility and is in proper working order.&#13;
Progress Indicators&#13;
25.          Project implementation would be monitored by tracking the volume of contracts awarded&#13;
and signed, equipment delivered and loan disbursements.&#13;

Annex K: Supervision Plan&#13;
1.     Because of the short implementation period, project supervision requirements would exceed the&#13;
usual co-efficient. The Project would, on average, require between 35 to 45 staff-weeks of Bank&#13;
supervision per fiscal year during implementation, as reflected in the proposed supervision plan below-':&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The purpose of the Medical Equipment
            Project is to initiate structural reform of the health care
            system in Russia. Specifically, the project is designed to:
            1) increase the availability, range and quality of services
            provided by primary health care facilities and raion
            hospitals; 2) reorient service delivery toward more cost
            effective health care; 3) decentralize decision making for
            capital investments to the facility level; and 4) support
            policy development through the introduction of national
            health accounts. The project will have three main
            components: 1) medical equipment including related supplies
            and training, furniture, spare parts and maintenance
            equipment to targeted health care facilities - both primary
            (polyclinics, women's clinics and feldsher stations)
            and secondary (raion hospitals and maternity homes); 2)
            national health accounts; and 3) project management.
