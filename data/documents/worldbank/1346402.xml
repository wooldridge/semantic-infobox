            Private participation in port facilities :
            recent trends
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The private sector has become
            increasingly involved in the operation of common-user port
            facilities during the 1990s, following public sector
            dominance of the sector since the 1940s. During the past
            decade the reform of port administration has gained momentum
            in industrial and developing countries alike. Between 1990
            and 1998, 112 port projects with private participation
            reached financial closure in twenty-eight developing
            countries, with investment commitments totaling more than
            US$9 billion. Most projects are in East Asia and Latin
            America, and most are long-term concessions. This Note
            provides an overview of the emerging trends in developing
            countries and outlines the main issues for the future. These
            issues include sustaining competition at a regional level,
            across networks, and with other transport sectors, such as
            road and rail.
