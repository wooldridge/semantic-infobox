WHEREAS:&#13;
(A)    IFC and the Bank have agreed to coordinate their support in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya,&#13;
Morocco, Tunisia and West Bank and Gaza (collectively, the "Region") in the area of micro, small, and&#13;
medium enterprises ("MSME"), as a comprehensive package of technical assistance, analytical and&#13;
advisory services and policy support ("TA Facility"), under the umbrella of the MENA MSME Facility&#13;
approved by IBRD in 2011.  The Donor and IFC may later agree to add Syria to the definition of the&#13;
Region, subject to the approval that may be also required from any other donors also contributing to the&#13;
TA Facility through the same trust funds as the Donor. The objectives of the TA Facility are:&#13;
i.    to improve the business environment for MSME finance;&#13;
ii.    to build the capacity of financial institutions for sustainable financing; and&#13;
iii.  to support MSME business development services.&#13;
(B)    The TA Facility is not a separate legal entity, but rather is a coordination mechanism of IFC and&#13;
the Bank currently administered by IFC's Middle East &amp; North Africa Department and by the Bank's&#13;
MENA Finance and Private Sector Development Department. Nothing in this Arrangement is intended to&#13;
create or imply a legal partnership between or among the Donor, IFC and the Bank, and any other donor&#13;
and/or any other person.&#13;
(C)    The Donor has expressed strong support for the TA Facility and wishes to provide funding for the&#13;
activities undertaken by IFC and the Bank under such TA Facility.&#13;
(D)    Each of IFC and the Bank is prepared to utilize funds provided by the Donor for the purpose of&#13;
financing activities undertaken by IFC (the "IFC Activities") and activities undertaken by the Bank (the&#13;
"Bank Activities", and collectively with the IFC Activities, the "Activities") within the framework of the&#13;
TA Facility.&#13;
(E)    For the above purpose, IFC and the Bank will set up on the provisions set forth below two trust&#13;
funds, identified by: (i) the number TFO71837 (the "IFC Donors' Trust Fund") to administer the funds&#13;
allocated for the lFC Activities; and (ii) the number TFO71823 (the "WB Multi-Donor Trust Fund"; and&#13;
collectively with the lFC Donors' Trust Fund, the "Trust Funds") to administer the funds allocated for the&#13;
Bank Activities.&#13;
NOW THEREFORE, the Signatories hereto decide as follows:&#13;
1      The Contributions&#13;
1.1  The initial contribution of the Donor under this Arrangement is ten million Canadian dollars&#13;
(CAD10,000,000) (the "Contribution") of which:&#13;
(a)    five million Canadian dollars (CAD5,000,000) is for the IFC Activities and is to&#13;
be credited to the IFC Donors' Trust Fund TFO71837; and&#13;
(b)    five million Canadian dollars (CAD5,000,000) is for the IBRD Activities and is&#13;
to be credited to the WB Multi-Donor Trust Fund TFO71823.&#13;

1.2  The Contributions will be used to finance the Activities in the Region and the categories of&#13;
expenditure set forth in the "Description of Activities and Expenditures under the IFC Donors&#13;
Trust Fund" attached hereto as Annex A ("IFC Activities"), and in the "Description of Activities&#13;
and Expenditures under the WB Multi-Donor Trust Fund" attached hereto as Annex B ("Bank&#13;
Activities"), respectively. The "Coordination Arrangements" for the Trust Funds are attached&#13;
hereto as Annex C. While the Donor understands that the Contribution may not be earmarked for&#13;
specific Activities or specific allocations, the Donor wishes that the Contribution be applied to&#13;
fund Activities in Jordan, Morocco and Egypt as described in Annex A and B of this&#13;
Arrangement. However, since the Contribution will be commingled with the other donors'&#13;
contributions to fund all the Activities, each of IFC and the Bank will endeavor to apply an&#13;
amount equivalent to five million Canadian dollars (CAD 5,000,000) from each of the IFC's&#13;
Donors' Trust Fund and the WB Multi-Donor Trust Fund to finance the IFC Activities and the&#13;
Bank Activities, respectively, in Jordan, Morocco and Egypt in accordance with such preference&#13;
of the Donor. Neither IFC nor the Bank will be in a position to guarantee that the Contribution&#13;
will be used in accordance with the Donor's preference, and IFC and the Bank will have no&#13;
obligation to the Donor if such preference cannot be achieved&#13;
1.3  The Contribution will be administered by IFC in relation to the IFC Donors Trust Fund and the&#13;
Bank in relation to the WB Multi-Donor Trust Fund for the account of the Donor in accordance&#13;
with the provisions of this Arrangement including the "Standard Provisions Applicable to the&#13;
IFC Donors' Trust Fund (TF071837) and the WB MSME Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
(TF071823)" (the "Standard Provisions") attached hereto as Annex D.&#13;
1.4  The Donor may later decide jointly with IFC and/or the Bank to contribute additional funds to&#13;
support the IFC Activities or the Bank Activities, as the case may be, which will be governed in&#13;
all respects by this Arrangement unless otherwise decided jointly. Notwithstanding the provisions&#13;
of this paragraph, it is understood between the Donor, the IFC and the Bank that any additional&#13;
funding will be subject to an amendment to this Arrangement, written and signed between the&#13;
Donor, the IFC and the Bank.&#13;
1.5  Other donors are also expected to contribute to the Trust Funds on the provisions specified in the&#13;
Annexes to this Arrangement. When other donors contribute funds to the IFC Donors' Trust&#13;
Fund and/or to the WB MSME Regional Multi-Donor Trust Fund, the aggregate of all the&#13;
Donors' contributions to either Trust Fund will be commingled in each Trust Fund and are&#13;
referred to in this Arrangement as the "Contributions".&#13;

ANNEX A&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF IFC ACTIVITIES AND EXPENDITURES UNDER THE IFC DONORS'&#13;
TRUST FUND (TF071837)&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to, and form an integral part of, all agreements entered into between IFC,&#13;
the Bank and entities that provide contributions (collectively, the "Donors") (the aggregate of all&#13;
contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to be administered by IFC for the IFC Donors' Trust&#13;
Fund (TF071837).&#13;
IFC Activities will cover financial infrastructure improvements, advisory services to financial&#13;
institutions and corporate governance and training program for MSMEs&#13;
Financial infrastructure program&#13;
IFC will extend its work on credit bureaus, secured transaction reforms and collateral registries as well as&#13;
mobile payment in the Region with a focus on MSME finance. IFC has a dedicated team of 3 senior&#13;
experts for this program. The objective of program is to increase the private sector's access to credit in&#13;
the Region by strengthening lenders' rights in movable assets, supporting the development of leasing as a&#13;
new financing tool for SMEs, developing effective credit reporting environment and enhancing the&#13;
framework for effective branchless banking solutions. This objective is achieved through legislative&#13;
reform resulting in enactment/amendment of laws, and awareness raising and capacity building activities&#13;
to increase knowledge among stakeholders' (both government and private sector) about the benefits of&#13;
well-functioning financial infrastructure.&#13;
The program is expected to leverage IFC partnership with the Arab Monetary Fund to improve the&#13;
financial infrastructure for lending to MSMEs. IFC currently has a team of four staff fully dedicated to&#13;
this financial infrastructure program.&#13;
Advisory to Financial Institutions&#13;
IFC will lead on advisory services to financial institutions to strengthen their capacity for sustainable and&#13;
innovative MSME banking. Of particular emphasis is building capacity of financial institutions to better&#13;
serve women entrepreneurs and youth. IFC has hired an experienced gender specialist for marketing and&#13;
designing banking products serving women enterprises.&#13;
Over the course of the program, IFC expects to advise 15 to 20 Arab banks on market analysis and&#13;
product development, underwriting policy, risk management and women entrepreneur finance. This&#13;
program is expected to have a significant impact on the volume and quality of banking services to SMEs&#13;
in the Arab world.&#13;
IFC will also provide advisory services to at least 15 microfinance institutions in priority countries. It&#13;
currently has a portfolio of 5 microfinance projects in the region supported by a team of 5 microfinance&#13;
experts with good experience in the region and fluency in Arabic or French. This program is expected to&#13;
have an impact on the sustainability and quality of products offering of MFIs in the Arab world. IFC&#13;
technical support to MFIs will focus on three areas:&#13;
1. Strengthening the institutional capacity of MFIs with a focus on risk management to better cope with&#13;
the ongoing crises.&#13;
2. Diversifying products, most MFIs are still focusing on microcredit, while savings and insurance&#13;
services are very important and require scaling up in the context of MENA.&#13;

3. Responsible finance, by facilitating the integration of MFIs in credit bureaus (already ongoing in&#13;
Morocco and Egypt) and providing TA support to MFIs on responsible lending practices and&#13;
financial literacy programs to clients.&#13;
MSME capacity building&#13;
IFC will deploy its flagship management training program for SMEs (Business Edge) as well as its web&#13;
based SME training program in the Region. IFC will ramp up its existing corporate governance program&#13;
with a focus on the Region.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
IFC has built a strong in house management and evaluation system to monitor project performance and&#13;
evaluate impacts. Each project has clear outputs, outcomes and impact objectives and is supervised&#13;
biannually (June and December) by management and the M&amp;E unit.&#13;
Categories of Expenditures&#13;
Expenditures will include those of WBG's consultants and staff dedicated to the implementation of the&#13;
IFC Activities, equipment, workshops/training, grants, office space and furniture, travel and&#13;
communications, public relations and business development expenses, and any other costs, all to the&#13;
extent incurred for the implementation of the IFC Activities. IFC will utilize the Donors' Funds for the&#13;
payment of salaries and benefits for WBG's staff and consultants only to the extent that their work is&#13;
dedicated to the implementation of the IFC Activities.&#13;
Start of Implementation of the IFC Activities&#13;
Funds from the IFC Donors' Trust Fund may be used by lFC to pay for any expenditure incurred in&#13;
connection with the implementation of the IFC Activities on or after January 1, 2012 until the date&#13;
determined in accordance with paragraph 7.1 of the Standard Provisions (Annex D).&#13;
