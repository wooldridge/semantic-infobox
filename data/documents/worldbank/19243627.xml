This report was prepared by a team of World Bank staff and consultants working on sustainable development, environment and resource&#13;
efficiency, growth and liberalization of international trade in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region of the World Bank, under the leader-&#13;
ship of Michal Rutkowski, Country Director Russia and Kulsum Ahmed, Sector Manager and with support of John Kellenberg, Manager,&#13;
Sustainable Business Advisory, International Finance Corporation. The report is inspired by the opportunities which Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s accession to the&#13;
World Trade Organization and trade liberalization presents to drive fundamental change that could help reverse environmental damage in&#13;
Russia and demonstrate that environment and trade goals could be mutually supportive.&#13;
&#13;
The report is a synthesis of inputs of a wide range of contributors and the team would like to acknowledge all of them. The team comprise&#13;
Adriana Damianova, Lead Environmental Specialist and Task Team Leader, Craig Meisner, Senior Environmental Economist and Co-Task Team&#13;
Leader, David Tarr, Former Lead Economist, Development Economics (DEC), and Vladislava Nemova, Natural Resources Economist. A central&#13;
element of the analysis is the economic modeling carried out by a team of Loch Alpine Economics led by Prof Christoph BÃ¶hringer and Prof&#13;
Thomas Rutherford, and Natalia Tourdiyeva, Senior Economist from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, the New Economic&#13;
School. Natalia Geyts, Associate Professor in Environmental Law made important contribution to the report. A team from International&#13;
Finance Corporation (IFC) led by Kristina Turilova, Operations Officer, Clean Production, contributed to the development of case studies and&#13;
included Boris Nekrasov and Vadim Shcherbakov. Victoria Mishina and Josephine Kida provided administrative support. Ana Hristoslavova&#13;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sustainable development is about profound change of policies that drive systemic transformation of production, consumption and behav-&#13;
ioral patterns. Policies which promote energy efficiency, technology innovation, clean production in supply chains, and addressing climate&#13;
change are receiving increasing attention in Russian society, and nowadays, shape the economic modernization agenda of the Russian&#13;
political leadership.&#13;
&#13;
On many fronts Russian economic polices demonstrate a noticeable transformation. The Government adopted1 ambitious goals to modern-&#13;
ize and transform the economy into an â&#128;&#156;economy of leadership and innovationâ&#128;&#157; focusing on sectors that will enable Russia â&#128;&#156;to compete&#13;
economically and geopolitically in a globalized world.â&#128;&#157; The fundamentals of the Government Policy for Economic Development of the&#13;
Russian Federation until 2030, acknowledge as a key task â&#128;&#156;ensuring ecologically-oriented economy growth and introduction of eco-efficient&#13;
technological innovations.â&#128;&#157; As President, Dmitry Medvedev stated â&#128;&#156;environmental quality must become the most important indicator of&#13;
quality of lifeâ&#128;&#157; and thus one of the key determinants of socio-economic development. He also emphasized that achieving this, henceforth,&#13;
will become a measure of local government effectiveness.2 In its Climate Doctrine,3 Russia officially acknowledges the alarming effects&#13;
of global warming and the threat it poses to its security, and has committed to improve its energy efficiency and reduce emissions. The&#13;
Energy Efficiency Law adopted in November 2009 marks a significant step towards efficient energy use and supply. Yet, economic and&#13;
technical modernization of aging industry remains a major challenge to address as Russia implements its World Trade Organization (WTO)&#13;
commitments.&#13;
&#13;
This report is designed to provide senior Russian policy makers with recommendations on certain areas where national environmental pro-&#13;
tection policies can be complemented by the benefits of trade liberalization. Industrial leaders may also benefit from many of the reportâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
conclusions and recommendation.&#13;
&#13;
The report has several objectives. The first is to draw attention to the local impacts of air pollution impacting human healthâ&#128;&#148;which have&#13;
been previously estimated to be between 12 and 17 percent of all-cause mortality in Russia and costing the economy upwards of $14 bil-&#13;
lion annually (Strukova, Balbus and Golub 2007; Reshetin and Kazazyan 2004). Correcting for this â&#128;&#156;external costâ&#128;&#157; to society is not trivial and&#13;
has serious implications for sector reform. The second objective is about reducing global warming, and in particular CO2. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s commit-&#13;
ments to reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions have adjustment costs to the economy and the modeling undertaken in this report provides&#13;
some relative magnitude. The third objective is related to the technological modernization that needs to take place in order to realize cost&#13;
reductions (efficiency improvements) and what the associated environmental benefits would be. Finally, the report also demonstrates how&#13;
the Government can reduce the marginal cost of funds from Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s tax system. What this means is that money is currently being spent&#13;
(tax Rubles) in an inefficient mannerâ&#128;&#148;either through large subsidies or funding inefficient production and consumption. Modernization,&#13;

      induced directly or indirectly, would serve to promote better efficiency and would represent a cost-savings to the Government in subsidiz-&#13;
      ing this economic structure.&#13;
&#13;
      The core of the paper is an economic modeling exercise that informs each of the above objectives. The model investigates the impacts&#13;
      of trade liberalization through three impacts: the change in production output (the scale effect), sector mix (the composition effect), and&#13;
      productivity (the technique effect). The model highlights several areas where benefits could lead to better protection of the environment, and&#13;
      where liberalization measures could significantly enhance the effectiveness of national policies to address key environmental challenges.&#13;
      This report discusses Russiaâ&#128;&#152;s accession to WTO from this perspective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      How Does Trade Liberalization Affect Environmental Quality?&#13;
&#13;
      There are concerns that environmental quality in Russia could be potentially affected by the trade liberalization. Economic and physi-&#13;
      cal linkages between trade, environment and development are complex and interdependent. From an economic perspective, WTO&#13;
      accession and the environment are related because most economic outputs are based on inputs from the environment, including the&#13;
      energy for processing them, and waste discharged to environment. However, trade liberalization effects on the environment would&#13;
      vary and depend on the sector, country policies, markets, technologies and management systems. Change of environmental quality as&#13;
      a result of potential expansion of â&#128;&#156;dirty industriesâ&#128;&#157; (for example, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, chemicals) could be mitigated by effec-&#13;
      tive and transparent enforcement mechanisms. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s economic gains from trade liberalization which are estimated to about US$49&#13;
      billion annually, based on 2010 GDP. For these gains to be environmentally sustainable, it will be crucial to implement complementary&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;do-no-harmâ&#128;&#157; policies tailored to address environmental concerns. This, in the long run, will be pivotal for sustaining the sources of&#13;
      gains from WTO accession.&#13;
&#13;
      Trade liberalization could induce reallocation of resources within Russia with some sectors expanding and some contracting.&#13;
      If expanding sectors are more pollution-intensive than contracting sectors, the sector reallocation of output will be harmful to the environ-&#13;
      mentâ&#128;&#148;unless there are countermeasures to reduce pollution. On the other hand, access to global markets and growing trade cooperation&#13;
      may create national wealth that can be used for environmental protection measures.&#13;
&#13;
      Various countries have struggled through the process of implementation of WTO accession rules and Russia will be no exception to that.&#13;
      WTO gives great latitude to its members to restrict trade to protect the environment and realize national environmental goals. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s ac-&#13;
      cession to WTO represents an enormous opportunity to make strides and overcome environmental damaging development by lowering&#13;
      trade barriers on green products and technologies. On one hand, Russia could foster the effectiveness of its own environmental protection&#13;
      policies, and, on the other hand, reaffirm its commitments to international environmental regimes governed by multilateral environmental&#13;
      agreements (MEA) especially those focusing on global environmental goods. Furthermore national and international policy instruments if&#13;
      implemented with transparency and participation will reduce significantly potential conflicts between trade liberalization and environmen-&#13;
      tal protection.&#13;
&#13;
      Trade liberalization can expand the marketplace and wealth creation opportunities. There is also a positive relationship between&#13;
      trade and environment, as the wealth that trade liberalization creates tends to generate a demand for environmental improvements; and&#13;
      trade liberalization induces efficiency gains from more effective resource use and less waste generation. Therefore, establishing more explicit&#13;
      links between trade liberalization and environmental performance, and shaping national policies with this in mind, is a useful direction for&#13;
      both policy makers and industries to consider.&#13;
&#13;
      At the same time, the worldwide trade and environment debate has broadened to include concerns that open trade will induce the pro-&#13;
      duction of pollution intensive goods to shift away from countries with stringent environmental and safety standards toward countries with&#13;

less stringent controls. Further excessive demand for natural resource commodities could undermine long-term development prospects&#13;
of natural resource based economies. By adding an environmental dimension to the earlier research on the economy-wide impacts of&#13;
WTO carried out by the World Bank, the analysis of the study addresses a specific question at hand: what are the environmental prospects&#13;
of WTO accession and what policies could be implemented that will allow Russia to achieve the greatest environmentally sustainable&#13;
growth?&#13;

Modeling Economic and Environmental Implications from Trade Liberalization: Key Results&#13;
&#13;
The study investigates the economic and environmental implications of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s accession to WTO, by employing a single-country, multi-&#13;
sector, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Russian economy constructed to capture characteristics of regional production&#13;
and consumption patterns and links regions via bilateral trade flows. The CGE model was then further developed to quantify the changes&#13;
in economy-wide emission levels and selected pollutants of interest from a policy and regulatory standpoint. The CGE model formulation&#13;
adopted for the study integrates data on CO2 and non-CO2 emissions4 and the associated costs of these technologies. The model used na-&#13;
tional output-input data from the national statistics office of the Russian Federation with data expanded from 22 to 30 economic sectors in&#13;
order to include more details on service industries. Environmental data was taken from the SUST-RUS Project which developed an integrated&#13;
spatial-economic-ecological modeling approach linked to environmental effects on sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
In order to quantify the economic and environmental impacts associated with WTO accession seven policy scenarios were developed. Three&#13;
of these scenarios show the impacts of overlapping policy reforms using the central case WTO liberalization (WTOcrts) that is implemented&#13;
simultaneously with â&#128;&#156;greenâ&#128;&#157; policies which include: (a) WTO liberalization with a commitment to CO2 reductions (CO2); (b) WTO liberalization&#13;
with an energy efficiency target (EEF); and (c) WTO liberalization with CO2 reductions and EEF. Note that the results do not include health&#13;
benefits normally associated with pollution reductionâ&#128;&#148;which could be quite significant. So pollution reduction to sectors enters the model&#13;
as a cost, but the potentially-realizable health benefits (improved worker productivity and lower health expenditures) do not. What this&#13;
implies is that the (negative) impact on sectors may not be as high as the results suggest due to the omission of the positive feedback of&#13;
improved worker productivity and lower health expenditures. Future model extensions could consider this to form a more complete and&#13;
dynamic picture.&#13;
&#13;
To illustrate the importance of productivity effects, the scenarios are grouped in two scenario groups. The first CRTS5 group does not refer to&#13;
any technology shift through productivity effects. As has been elaborated, however, by Jensen, Rutherford and Tarr (2007) and Rutherford&#13;
and Tarr (2010), productivity effects from trade and foreign direct investment liberalization are central to the impacts of WTO accession of&#13;
Russia. We focus on our second group of scenarios as our central groupâ&#128;&#148;they feature increasing returns to scale (IRTS), with productivity&#13;
effects from trade liberalization and liberalization of barriers to foreign direct investment. Productivity effects imply non-negligible increases&#13;
in CO2, PM, CO, NOx, and VOC, although a decrease in SO2 and a small decrease in CnHm. The impacts of policy changes are shown mainly&#13;
in terms of percentage changes in key variables from the base year 2001, which is the last year for which economy-wide, disaggregate, trade&#13;
data at regional level is available.&#13;
&#13;
The table below provides a summary of CTRS and IRTS scenarios and the economic and environmental impacts of trade reforms and&#13;
environmental regulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4    In particular, the model includes information on: particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons&#13;
     (CnHm), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).&#13;
5    CGE models of constant-returns-to-scale (CRTS), where competitive markets capture the composition and scale effects triggered by trade liberalization&#13;
     policies. CRTS, however, omits potentially important productivity changes in sector production (that is, part of the technique effect).&#13;

&#13;
      The summary results show that if WTO accession is viewed in isolation of any other policies on energy or pollution reduction targetsâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
      impact looks to be quite positive for the economyâ&#128;&#148;as measured by its impact on income. However, largely due to a shift to â&#128;&#156;dirtierâ&#128;&#157; (more&#13;
      pollution-intensive) sectors, the environmental picture looks less positive. Similarly, if environmental policies are pursued without account-&#13;
      ing for the economically-beneficial aspects of WTO accessionâ&#128;&#148;the impact on income is negative. Crucially, the results from the economic&#13;
      modeling show that when WTO accession and environmental policies are combined (taking into account potential improvements in productivity&#13;
      from WTO accession (for example, the adoption of more modern technologies that are also more environmentally friendly) there is a substantial&#13;
      increase in income and an improvement in the environment as well.&#13;
&#13;
      For example, just looking at the case of CO2 emissions (scenarios without productivity spillover) indicates that applying uniform emis-&#13;
      sion standards across sectors would result in a loss of real income and does not constitute a cost effective measure for emissions&#13;
      reduction. The objective of reducing energy intensity should be pursued through a system of tradable efficiency permits across energy&#13;
      carriers, sectors, and regions rather than through specific mandates on all firms. A tradable scheme would achieve the same emission&#13;
      reduction objective, at a lower cost since some firms who will have higher marginal abatement cost could purchase permits from lower&#13;
      cost firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Why Does Trade Liberalization Present Signiï¬&#129;cant Opportunities for Environmental Improvements?&#13;
&#13;
      Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s WTO Accession presents significant opportunities for economy-wide improvements in economic output, productivity, and govern-&#13;
      ment revenues. Russia will also reap substantial gains from WTO accession with widespread benefits such as reduced poverty and greater&#13;
      economic gains in regions that establish a better investment climate. At the same, trade liberalization presents enormous opportunities for&#13;
      lowering the barriers for overcoming many environmental and human health consequences of localized industrial pollution by employing&#13;
      the policy synergies described in this report.&#13;
&#13;
      The impact of trade liberalization on the output of different sectors will be mixed, with some expected to expand and some&#13;
      expected to decline. There will be a negative impact on sector output from tariff decreases on the import-competing sectors. But there&#13;
      will be a positive impact from a decline in the price of intermediate inputs in goods and services. Export-intensive industries should see an&#13;
      increase in the prices they receive in rubles from a depreciation of the real exchange rate and improved treatment in antidumping. More&#13;

&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                                                                                                                XV&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
generally, export-intensive sectors such as ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals and chemicals are the manufacturing sectors are most likely to&#13;
expand, while light industry, food industry and construction materials are sectors that most likely to contract. Since the expanding sectors&#13;
are more pollution-intensive and natural resource using than contracting sectors, the sector reallocation of output could have a negative&#13;
impact on the environment (unless there are countermeasures to reduce pollution).&#13;
&#13;
The technology choices from WTO accession and from complementary environmental policies are more important than the&#13;
scale of production on the product mix of production induced by WTO accession. WTO accession will increase in emissions from the&#13;
scale effect (more output) and from a likely shift toward more polluting industries. But direct emission pricing or indirect emission pricing&#13;
through energy efficiency standards would cause price-responsive technology adjustment in production and consumption through fuel&#13;
switching or energy saving technologies that would dominate.&#13;
&#13;
Increased access to foreign suppliers of environmental goods and services6 would allow Russian enterprises to choose from&#13;
a wider set of technologies and management systems which will reduce the costs of producing in a more environmentally-&#13;
friendly manner. The potential gains from WTO accession affords substantial opportunities to improve environmental quality in many&#13;
regions by introducing energy efficiency standards, and emissions pricing levels that would push adoption of clean technologies. The&#13;
objective of reducing energy intensity should be pursued through a system of tradable efficiency permits across energy carriers, sectors, and&#13;
regions rather than through specific mandates on all firms. A tradable scheme would achieve the same emission reduction objective, at a&#13;
lower cost since some firms who will have higher marginal abatement cost could purchase permits from lower cost firms.&#13;
&#13;
Focusing on selected policy measures that can help recoup potential increase of industrial emissions and simultaneously in-&#13;
fluence behavioral change towards the use of more energy efficient and cleaner technologies, would be a win-win approach.&#13;
On one hand, it will help address the pending trade-offs between economic growth and pollution triggered by trade liberalization, and, on&#13;
the other, complement the effective implementation of WTO rules. In order to increase Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s environmental policy effectiveness while&#13;
modernizing industry and trade, of no lesser priority will be to neutralize the negative ecological consequences from past economic activi-&#13;
ties. Furthermore, an important step will be to align environmental policy and practice with international norms and standards as well as&#13;
to combine environmental and economic levers of influencing pollutersâ&#128;&#153; behavior. Several policy areas which if implemented consistently&#13;
could reinforce in a positive way the long term impacts on the sustainability profile of Russian industry. These include:&#13;
&#13;
    Â§ Reform the current system of pollution charges by introducing coefficients that capture meaningful economic incentives for adop-&#13;
         tion of best available techniques;&#13;
    Â§ Extend the opportunities for temporary tax breaks and privileges for industries that are fiscally neutral from public finance point of&#13;

&#13;
There are substantial opportunities for potential gains from WTO accession to improve environmental quality in many&#13;
regions by introducing energy efficiency standards, and emissions pricing levels that would push adoption of clean techno-&#13;
logies. Russia will reap substantial gains from WTO accession with widespread benefits such as reduced poverty and greater economic&#13;
gains in regions that establish better investment climate. Introduction of market-based instruments (MBIs) could create a platform for&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;greeningâ&#128;&#157; and win-win outcomes, thereby stimulating compliance and better environmental performance. In fact, Russian environmental&#13;
      protection policies refer to Best Available Techniques (BAT) as a way to make more effective pollution prevention and controls and improve&#13;
      industrial environmental compliance. Since, the framework for implementation of BATs is yet to be developed the analysis of the report&#13;
      suggests the adoption of market based instruments that allow firms with higher costs of abatement to trade with firms with lower costs to&#13;
      achieve the better level of environmental quality in a movement toward BATs. To address political opposition to environmental abatement&#13;
      policies among firms, mechanisms could be designed that are broadly revenue neutral, that is, there could be tax incentives provided for&#13;
      firms that adopt clean technologies at the same time there are charges for pollution.&#13;
&#13;
      Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to implement its Climate Doctrine, supported by the Complex Implementation Plan of Actions until&#13;
      20207, is another venue for operationalization of the modernization agenda in the industry, transport and housing sectors.&#13;
      Trade liberalization will increase the opportunities for innovation, using renewable and energy efficient technologies as well as the contri-&#13;
      bution of Russia to international efforts to mitigate climate change impacts. To address political opposition to environmental abatement&#13;
      policies among firms, mechanisms could be designed that are broadly revenue neutral, that is, there could be tax incentives provided for&#13;
      firms that adopt clean technologies at the same time there are charges for pollution. Transition to an effective system of incentives that&#13;
      promotes less resource use, cleaner and greener production would typically also improve competitiveness and increase access to export&#13;
      markets which demand efficient, low environmental-impact materials and products. By taking this avenue Russia could reaffirm its standing&#13;
      on its target of 25 percent announced at COP15 and 40 percent goal mentioned in Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s state program on â&#128;&#156;Energy Savings and Energy&#13;
      Efficiency Improvements until 2020.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
      There is evidence that Russian production sector can gauge the potential of cleaner, more efficient, technologies while ben-&#13;
      efiting from resource efficiency savings. Several recent studies, conducted by the International Finance Cooperation (IFC) in collabora-&#13;
      tion with the foundry and automotive sectors, have shown that enormous cost savings exist. For example, given the low costs of labor,&#13;
      energy, and raw materials, Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s ferrous foundry industry could potentially realize a 36 percent cost advantage over its international peers.&#13;
      The case study on the Russian foundries discussed in the report shows that more than half of the resource efficiency savings and benefits&#13;
      could be achieved through better management practices and various low-cost initiatives alone, with no need for major capital expenditure.&#13;
      However, due to poor resource efficiency, and a lack of focus on quality, means this advantage is entirely lost. Factory audits revealed that&#13;
      improvements in resource efficiency could result in a cost savings of up to $3.3 billion annually to the sector.&#13;
&#13;
      The main finding of this analysis is that productivity increases from Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s WTO accession and trade liberalization are substantial. While&#13;
      trade liberalization will induce more pollution, the real income growth is large enough to pay for greening of the industry in terms of CO2&#13;
      emission reduction and energy efficiency improvements, with the majority of real income growth remaining. Thus, WTO may be used in a&#13;
      manner that increased both real income and environmental quality in regions with high concentration of polluting industries. Trade and&#13;
      environment thus might not be viewed as antipodes but rather as mutually beneficial in the spirit of green growth.&#13;

     62 This is known as the Lerner Symmetry Theorem. It follows from the fact&#13;
        that trade liberalization increases the demand for imports and therefore&#13;
        the demand for foreign exchange. The home countryâ&#128;&#153;s currency must&#13;
        depreciate to reestablish equilibrium in its foreign exchange market; the             63 Decree of the President of the Russian Federation from September 30&#13;
        depreciated real exchange rate improves the incentives to exporters.                     2013, No. 752 â&#128;&#156;On Reduction of GHG Emissions.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

                          TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES 68&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Measures for environmental protection should be applied in alignment with the basic WTO rulesâ&#128;&#148;the nondiscrimination obligation and&#13;
the prohibition of quantitative restrictionsâ&#128;&#148;and should not constitute a â&#128;&#156;disguised restriction on international trade.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
 THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION                                                                                        PROHIBITION OF QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS&#13;
 If trade-related environmental or health measures are to be consistent with WTO rules, they            Certain environmental measures (such as bans) may violate the GATT Article XI, which provides,&#13;
 cannot result in discrimination:                                                                       among other things, that restrictions on the importation or sale of products from other WTO&#13;
  (i) between â&#128;&#156;likeâ&#128;&#157; products from different trading partners, and                                      members are prohibited.&#13;
 (ii) between its own and like foreign products&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A number of WTO Agreements have provisions for environmental measures:&#13;
&#13;
 The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)&#13;
 The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)&#13;
 GATT Article XX on General Exceptions lays out two exceptions of particular relevance to the protection of the environment: WTO members may adopt policy measures that are inconsistent with GATT&#13;
 disciplines, but are:&#13;
 â&#128;¢ necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health (paragraph (b)), or&#13;
 â&#128;¢ relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources (paragraph (g)).&#13;
 GATS Article XIV on General Exceptions, paragraph (b), allows WTO members to adopt policy measures that would normally be inconsistent with GATS if this is â&#128;&#156;necessary to protect human, animal or&#13;
 plant life or health.â&#128;&#157; This must not result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination and must not constitute protectionism in disguise.&#13;
 The Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)&#13;
 The TBT Agreement tries to ensure that regulations, standards, testing and certification procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade, while also providing members with the right to imple-&#13;
 ment measures to achieve environmental and health policy objectives. Among the agreementâ&#128;&#153;s important features are:&#13;
 â&#128;¢ nondiscrimination in the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures;&#13;
 â&#128;¢ avoiding unnecessary obstacles to trade;&#13;
 â&#128;¢ harmonizing specifications and procedures with international standards as far as possible;&#13;
 â&#128;¢ the transparency of these measures, through governments notifying them to the WTO Secretariat and establishing national enquiry points.&#13;
 The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS)&#13;
 The SPS Agreement allows countries to set their own food safety and animal and plant health standards. Regulations must be based on science and should be applied only to the extent necessary to&#13;
 protect human, animal or plant life or health. They should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between countries where identical or similar conditions prevail.&#13;
 The SPS Agreement allows members to adopt SPS measures for environmental purposes, but subject to such requirements as risk assessment, nondiscrimination and transparency. Member&#13;
 countries are encouraged to use international standards, guidelines and recommendations where they exist.&#13;
 The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS)&#13;
 The TRIPS Agreement refers explicitly to the environment in Section 5, which deals with patents (Article 27.2 and 27.3). The TRIPS Agreement allows members to refuse to patent inventions that may&#13;
 endanger the environment (provided their commercial exploitation is prohibited as a necessary condition for the protection of the environment). For ethical or other reasons, they can also exclude&#13;
 plants or animals from patentability, subject to the conditions described above.&#13;
 The Agreement on Agriculture&#13;
 In its preamble, the Agreement on Agriculture reiterates membersâ&#128;&#153; commitment to reform agriculture in a manner that protects the environment. Annex 2 explains the domestic support measures for&#13;
 which exemption from the reduction commitments can be claimed, if they meet the fundamental requirement that they have no, or at most minimal, trade-distorting effects or effects on produc-&#13;
 tion (so-called Green Box). Among these measures are expenditures under environmental programs (for example, research programs, infrastructure works), provided that they meet certain conditions.&#13;
 Plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement&#13;
 The Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) provides disciplines on nondiscrimination and transparency in procurement of covered goods and services by designated governmental&#13;
 entities. Article XXIII specifies that exceptions to the Agreement apply, if necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health. Parties may also evaluate offers received based on environmental&#13;
 characteristics set out in notices or tender documentation.&#13;

            Environmental perspective of Russia's
            accession to the world trade organization
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Russia's exports, imports, and
            ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) continue
            to grow. In December 2011, after eighteen years of
            negotiations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) invited
            Russia to join WTO on the basis of the negotiated protocol
            of Russian accession. Russia ratified the agreement in July
            2012. As part of its accession to the WTO, Russia agreed to
            a series of important commitments to further open its trade
            and foreign investment regimes. Russia will apply
            international standards on sanitary measures and technical
            barriers to trade. Policies which promote energy efficiency,
            technology innovation, clean production in supply chains,
            and addressing climate change are receiving increasing
            attention in Russian society, and nowadays, shape the
            economic modernization agenda of the Russian political
            leadership. This report is designed to provide senior
            Russian policy makers with recommendations on certain areas
            where national environmental protection policies can be
            complemented by the benefits of trade liberalization.
            Industrial leaders may also benefit from many of the
            report's conclusions and recommendation. The report has
            several objectives. The first is to draw attention to the
            local impacts of air pollution impacting human health which
            has been previously estimated to be between 12 and 17
            percent of all-cause mortality in Russia and costing the
            economy upwards of 14 billion dollars annually. Correcting
            for this "external cost" to society is not trivial
            and has serious implications for sector reform. The second
            objective is about reducing global warming, and in
            particular carbon dioxide (CO2). Russia's commitments
            to reducing greenhouse gas emissions have adjustment costs
            to the economy and the modeling undertaken in this report
            provides some relative magnitude. The third objective is
            related to the technological modernization that needs to
            take place in order to realize cost reductions (efficiency
            improvements) and what the associated environmental benefits
            will be. Finally, the report also demonstrates how the
            Government can reduce the marginal cost of funds from
            Russia's tax system. What this means is that money is
            currently being spent (tax Rubles) in an inefficient manner
            - either through large subsidies or funding inefficient
            production and consumption. The model investigates the
            impacts of trade liberalization through three impacts: the
            change in production output (the scale effect), sector mix
            (the composition effect), and productivity (the technique
            effect). The model highlights several areas where benefits
            can lead to better protection of the environment, and where
            liberalization measures can significantly enhance the
            effectiveness of national policies to address key
            environmental challenges. This report discusses
            Russia's accession to WTO from this perspective.
