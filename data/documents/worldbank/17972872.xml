&#13;
ZIEGLER: Today is March 3, 2006. My name is Charles Ziegler, a consultant with the World&#13;
Bank Group's Oral History Program. I am at the home of Mr. Jochen Kraske to conduct an oral&#13;
history interview.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Kraske began his distinguished World Bank career as an early member ofthe Young&#13;
Professionals Program [YP] in 1964. He was chief of the East Asia division dealing with Korea,&#13;
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, Papua and New Guinea and New Zealand between 1967 and&#13;
1971. He was chief of the India Division in the South Asia Department from 1971 to 1975;&#13;
twice chief of the Bank's resident mission in New Delhi, 1975 to 1979 and 1987 to 1991;&#13;
director of the Country Programs Department of the Eastern Africa Region from 1979 to 1987;&#13;
and director of the Country Department for Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka in the South Asia&#13;
Region, 1991 to 1992. He served as World Bank Historian from 1993 to 1997, and retired in&#13;
1997.&#13;
&#13;
Well, Jochen, thank you for having me here today. To begin things and put things in context,&#13;
when were you born?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I was born on Christmas Day, 1932, in Berlin, Germany; that is to say, a month&#13;
before Hitler came to power. My childhood and early youth was overshadowed by the events&#13;
taking place in Germany at that time, in particular the Second World War and the post-war years.&#13;
I was 6 years old when the Second World War started, 12 when it was over.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did you live in Berlin all that time?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: We lived in Berlin all this time, except for two years during the war, when there was&#13;
a move to resettle small children into the countryside. I think there was a similar program in&#13;
Britain.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In England, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: And so I went and spent the last couple of years of the war in the eastern part of&#13;
Germany with relatives, in the part of Germany which is now part of Poland, and returned to&#13;
Berlin almost on the last train that came from the east into Berlin. I then spent a couple of&#13;
months in Berlin during the increasing bombardment of the city, and left again in March of' 45&#13;
for Mecklenburg, a state north of Berlin, where my sister was living on a large farm. I stayed&#13;
with her and her family and many relatives, who had fled from further east ahead of the invading&#13;
Russian army. Following the take-over of the Russians in early May 1945, I stayed in&#13;
Mecklenburg for about a year before returning to Berlin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jochen Kraske&#13;
                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And you settled in the western part?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Our house happened to be in the American sector of Berlin. We stayed in Berlin&#13;
until 1948 and, during the blockade of the city, left Berlin for Freiburg/Breisgau, which was the&#13;
hometown of my father, where I finished high school. Subsequently, much of my further&#13;
education was at the University of Freiburg.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Where else did you go to university, then?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I started in Freiburg and studied economics. I went to Seville, Spain, early on&#13;
because I wanted to spend time abroad, far from horne and relatively warm in winter. So I spent&#13;
close to a year in Seville. Following my return to Germany in the spring of 1956, I spent a year&#13;
in Berlin attending the Free University. I returned to Freiburg to finish my exam, and later my&#13;
doctorate. In 1962 I accepted a scholarship and spent a year at Yale University, as a postgraduate&#13;
fellow.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And this was before you joined the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This is before joining the World Bank. In fact, it was at Yale that I learned about the&#13;
World Bank's new program to recruit university graduates.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You're referring to the Young Professionals Program?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This was the Young Professionals Program, which was then still called the Junior&#13;
Professionals Program.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were one of which group?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I was in the second group, which was really an appendage of the first group. We&#13;
joined ip January '64, and we were only 6 compared to, I think, about 15 in the first group, who&#13;
had joined three months earlier.&#13;
&#13;
In those days, the Bank still thought that we would benefit from some theoretical classroom&#13;
training, so we were sent to the EDI [Economic Development Institute] to take courses from the&#13;
staff at the ED I. But it soon turned out to be a mistake because the recruits had been brought up&#13;
on a diet of economics education at top universities, and hence tended to be as knowledgeable, or&#13;
more knowledgeable, than their teachers, which often proved embarrassing.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So this part of our training was quickly dropped. It was also soon decided to shorten&#13;
the training period. At the outset of the program, the expectation was that we would spend two&#13;
years as trainees. This was quickly reduced to one-and-a-half years, and later to one year, mainly&#13;
because it proved awkward to integrate trainees meaningfully into the operational work of the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jochen Kraske&#13;
                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I suppose you didn't have any work experience before joining the Bank. You pretty&#13;
much came right o_ut of university and went to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I had work experience in the form of a two-year apprenticeship after high school,&#13;
when I worked in a factory producing office equipment. This was a commercial apprenticeship&#13;
based on the German system of vocational training, and a good introduction into how&#13;
commercial organizations work. It was also an experience that convinced me that I needed to&#13;
upgrade my skills through academic training. So I went to the university and never looked back.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What induced you to apply to the World Bank's Young Professional Program?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, it was really-when I went to Yale, my objective was a career in the&#13;
university in Germany.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As an academic?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: As an academic. In Germany, at least at that time, this was a very protracted and&#13;
difficult process. So beyond your Ph.D. dissertation, you had to yet publish another major opus,&#13;
the so-called habilitation. And so, in thinking about this career, I was wondering what subject I&#13;
would want to pick for this purpose, and decided that I wanted to work on the issue of&#13;
international monetary reform, which was very topical at that time.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This was the early '60s?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This was in the early '60s, and there was at least one prominent proponent of reform&#13;
proposals teaching at Yale at the time. That was Robert Triffin, a Belgian economist. There was&#13;
also another economist, who had written a lot about German post-war economic policies, Henry&#13;
Wallich.&#13;
&#13;
But by the time I received the scholarship, I was informed that neither of these two professors&#13;
would be there. So I went to Yale really a bit at loose ends. I spent the year listening to a great&#13;
variety of people and working on various subjects. One ofthe topics on the agenda was&#13;
economic development, about which I knew next to nothing at the time.&#13;
&#13;
As I was of scanning the horizon and looking at the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the&#13;
World Bank-the IMF would have been the logical choice, given the topic I was interested in-I&#13;
ended up talking to the World Bank. In due course, I was offered an appointment, I accepted and&#13;
never looked back.&#13;
&#13;
I still remember my interview with Richard [W.] VanWagenen, who was a professor at the&#13;
American University in Washington, and had been hired to set up and administer the Young&#13;
Professional Program.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He passed away a few years ago.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He was well into his nineties.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In my interview with him, he asked me how long I thought I would stay with the World Bank&#13;
and I said, "Oh, a couple of years or so." He said in that case the Bank was not really interested&#13;
in hiring me, as the Bank was looking for people who wanted to make a career working for the&#13;
World Bank. I replied that if the work turned out to be attractive and stimulating enough, I would&#13;
probably stay longer. As it turned out, I spent 34 years working for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What were some of your early experiences in the Bank as a YP that would be worth&#13;
relating?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, our life as YP was in a way somewhat frustrating. As I said, we spent some of&#13;
our time in classroom activities, but we were assigned early on to the various departments in the&#13;
Bank. Now, I think it is correct to say that in those days the Bank was rather comfortably staffed.&#13;
In other words, the volume of staff time measured against the amount of work that had to be&#13;
performed by the institution was rather generous. So when we landed in the operating divisions&#13;
of the Bank-and this was an experience which seemed to be shared fairly universally among all&#13;
the members of these first two groups-we found that we weren't really needed.&#13;
&#13;
I would sort of periodically walk into the office of my supervisor, the division chief of the Near&#13;
East Division dealing with Iraq and Iran and a bunch of countries where the Bank wasn't active&#13;
at all; Iran happened to be the only country in this division where the Bank was making some&#13;
loans. I would ask him to give me something to do, and would find him squirming and not really&#13;
able to respond. Eventually, he would come up with something, but, you know, within a day I&#13;
would have dealt with this problem and would be back on his doorstep again asking for more.&#13;
Now eventually he had the idea of putting me to work on something that in some sense might&#13;
have been make work, but turned out to be quite interesting: He asked me to do studies of the file&#13;
history on various operational subjects.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So you had an early start on your later career as Bank historian.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It was an early start on my later work as a Bank historian. It was a research activity&#13;
which appealed to me-which involved going through the records and piecing together the story.&#13;
The first story was about what the Bank had ever said about feeder roads in Iran. I put together a&#13;
little paper, and I think several years later the Bank, in fact, did make a loan in support of&#13;
constructing feeder roads in Iran, presumably initiated by this effort.&#13;
&#13;
Since this turned out to be so successful, soon the India Division came and requested my services&#13;
and asked me to do a file study of the history of lending for the port of Calcutta in India. And so&#13;
I went through the records and eventually came up with a paper, the conclusion of which was&#13;
that the next step in our relationship with Calcutta should be lending for Haldia, an alternative&#13;
port site downstream from Calcutta on the Hooghli River.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I've heard of that project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jochen Kraske&#13;
                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Several years later there was a loan for the construction of the port ofHaldia, and I&#13;
suppose that port still exists, although the Hooghli River remains a problematic river as far as&#13;
navigation is concerned because ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: It silts up.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes, it is silting up very heavily and requires an inordinate amount of dredging.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, Jochen, as you know, I spent almost all my career in the Bank in the&#13;
Archives, so I'm interested in this research you were doing. This early research would have been&#13;
during the mid-'60s, I imagine.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I started in the Bank in January of '64, so this was in '64. It was essentially in '64&#13;
because in the fall of '64 I was drafted to go with the [Bernard R.] Bell Mission to India.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which we'll get to, as it's important. But my question here is: what was your sense&#13;
of the completeness of the files at that time? Did you find what you needed?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, whatever I found I pulled together, and then kind of knitted together a story. I&#13;
remember here a person who was at that time in charge of the operational files, and she was a&#13;
wonderful and extremely helpful person. Her name was Betty [E.] Kinsey.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, yeah, I worked with Betty.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: She was just wonderful. She knew where everything was, and she would unfailingly&#13;
point you in the right direction. I doubt whether I would have been able to complete this job&#13;
without her support.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: She later became the first supervisor ofthe Records Center, and that's where I&#13;
worked for her. We still exchange Christmas cards. She's, I think, around 88 now, living in&#13;
England, still doing well.&#13;
&#13;
You touched on the atmosphere ofthe Bank. I've heard it said that the pre- [RobertS.]&#13;
McNamara Bank exhibited, "a leisurely perfectionism and an afternoon tea atmosphere." Could&#13;
you compare that with your later experiences in the Bank, just in terms of the atmosphere and the&#13;
pace of work?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The way you put it, or the way this formulation puts it is of course negative in a&#13;
way. And I know that George [D.] Woods, when he came to the Bank, tended to be very critical,&#13;
and referred to the Bank as some sort of country club operation. But I think if you want to put&#13;
this in a more favorable light, the Bank was at that time more akin to an academic and&#13;
professional institution, it was not a corporate enterprise focused on producing maximum output.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: McNamara changed all that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jochen Kraske&#13;
                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes, the Bank changed when McNamara took over. Lending output had not been the&#13;
focus of the Bank at that time; the focus of the Bank was to understand what was happening in&#13;
the member countries, and to find ways and means for the Bank to be helpful in this still very&#13;
new field of economic development. The Bank staff was of the highest caliber, both as far as&#13;
academic and intellectual standards are concerned, and also as far as the integrity of people is&#13;
concerned.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So, when you joined, you found the staffvery impressive, I gather?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yeah. I also still remember the way the Bank functioned. You would go into these&#13;
meetings and it was not organizational rank that would establish the authority of people and the&#13;
respect they enjoyed, but their personal reputation as professionals. So you would have meetings&#13;
attended by some professional, who might not be anywhere on the organizational ladder, yet he&#13;
would totally dominate the meeting, and everybody would defer to this person, by virtue of his&#13;
experience. The bureaucratic structure ofthe organization was distinctly downplayed at that&#13;
time. This appealed to me a great deal.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Would you say then that this became somewhat less true as time went on?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This became less true, and it was clear that when McNamara took over that he&#13;
established a bureaucratic structure that allowed him, first of all, to control the organization; at&#13;
the same time it was designed to push people to exert themselves more, and to compete.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, yes. Your mentioning the quality of the staff makes me wonder: Was there&#13;
anybody who served as something of a mentor to you in your early days in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Not really. One person that sort oftook to me and took me under his wing was [G.]&#13;
Stewart Mason, who was at that time the chief ofthe Pakistan Division. In those days, the&#13;
Pakistan Division was important because it was dealing with the Indus Basin Fund, and therefore&#13;
administered a fairly large program of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That was a fairly new thing following the 1960 Indus Basin agreement between&#13;
India and Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Subsequent to the agreement, the Indus Basin Development Fund was set up to&#13;
provide the means needed to construct all the dams and canals that would allow India and&#13;
Pakistan to share the waters of the five eastern rivers.&#13;
&#13;
I remember, I lived up close to Dupont Circle and would walk down to the Bank, and he was&#13;
also walking. He lived in the same area, on N Street, and would walk to the Bank. He obviously&#13;
had observed me walking to the Bank, and at one point we were walking together. He decided&#13;
that he wanted to hire me into his division dealing with Pakistan. So once I finished my Young&#13;
Professional training, I joined the Pakistan Division under him. And he took a fatherly interest in&#13;
what I was doing. I can't say that he was shaping my career, but he was certainly a mentor that I&#13;
could tum to for advice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Jochen Kraske&#13;
                               March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Another person of similar importance was Gordon [M.] Street, who preceded me as division&#13;
chief in the East Asia area and who had a lot of experience concerning East Asia in particular. So&#13;
I worked to some extent under him and with him, and he helped me whenever I ran into trouble.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: When you joined, the YPs were basically a new staff category in the Bank. How&#13;
were they generally regarded by other staff?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, let me say first of all that I joined this program in all innocence. I had riot&#13;
really focused on the career aspirations inherent in this program, quite in contrast to some of my&#13;
classmates. I mean, people like Wilfried [P.] Thalwitz or Kim [Edward V. K.] Jaycox; from the&#13;
moment they entered the Bank, they were counting the days before they would become vice&#13;
president and God knows what.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was Kim Jaycox in your group?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No. He came a year later. He came, I think, in the fall of '64.&#13;
&#13;
I had little idea that the purpose of the program was to be promoted and to achieve higher&#13;
positions in the organization. I was interested in the problems that the Bank was dealing with,&#13;
and somewhat innocently dealt with the career aspirations.&#13;
&#13;
Now, inside the Bank organization I suppose there was a better understanding of this program as&#13;
a management training program. And professionals, especially the technical staff, the engineers&#13;
and agriculturalists and so on, suspected that this was a program that was going to create the&#13;
people who would organize and manage their lives down the road. Therefore they were&#13;
somewhat wary when these youngsters walked into the door and sat next to them and tried to&#13;
pick their brains; so they were reluctant in many cases to freely share what they knew, and what&#13;
made for the strength of their performance. So, if many of these Young Professionals initially&#13;
found themselves without challenging work, it was in part also because there was this suspicion&#13;
about what these people were going to become.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: When you say "without challenging work," you mean during your time as YPs?&#13;
You were saying before that you often found yourself somewhat at loose ends as to what to do.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right, yeah. I mean, people would just hold on to what they were doing, and not&#13;
delegating and sharing what was on their plate.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You became a division chief in the East Asia and Pacific Department, Division E.&#13;
You spent two years as a division chief with responsibility for China-that is, Taiwan-Hong&#13;
Kong, Japan, and Korea.&#13;
&#13;
From 1953 through 1966, Japan was the Bank's biggest borrower, with 31 loans for over $857&#13;
million. The cordial relationship established during its 13 years as a borrower was a factor in its&#13;
subsequent decision to become a lender to the Bank. The last Bank loan to Japan had been in&#13;
1966. What were your observations on the transition of Japan from borrower to lender?&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: When I took over this position, it was already clear that Japan was no longer a client&#13;
in need of Bank assistance, although we still at that time had, I think, two loans that were&#13;
disbursing. I like to tell people that I would still go to Japan on supervision missions. This was&#13;
quite an experience. You would arrive and be treated like royalty with all these people wearing&#13;
gloves and so on conducting you around the place.&#13;
&#13;
But it was clear that Japan was quickly moving from a position where it needed to import capital,&#13;
in particular from the Bank on concessional terms, to a position where Japan, in fact, had a&#13;
capital surplus. And in a short time, this surplus became quite embarrassing and a bit of a&#13;
problem to Japan. So it was natural for Japan to come to the Bank-this must have been in 1970,&#13;
I reckon-and propose that the Bank premature the loans that were outstanding to Japan.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You mean pay them off?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Pay these loans off, and then subsequently very quickly move into a position where&#13;
the Bank was increasingly raising funds in the Japanese capital market. This was one of the&#13;
achievements of McNamara early on, to develop the Japanese market for the Bank as a source of&#13;
funds.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Korea did not become a borrower from the Bank until the late 1960s, and indeed it&#13;
was initially poor enough to be eligible for IDA [International Development Association] credits.&#13;
However, considerable progress had been made since the end of the Korean War. The Bank&#13;
report entitled The Economic Situation and Prospects of the Republic of Korea, dated September&#13;
13, 1971, states, quote, "Korea will this year complete its second five-year plan of development&#13;
with one of the most impressive records among the developing countries of economic growth&#13;
during the 1960s. This year, the real growth rate of the economy will probably again be near the&#13;
12 percent average rate for the 1967 to 1971 plan period. Export achievements, starting from a&#13;
low base, have been even more outstanding, with a probable gain this year of about 25 percent,&#13;
and a 33 percent average annual increase in the five-year period." Could you relate some of your&#13;
impressions of what proved to be the early stages of Korea becoming one of the Asian tigers?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: When I started working with Korea, as I mentioned to you, my boss at the time, [1.]&#13;
Peter [M.] Cargill, suggested that Korea was a basket case. This was in 1967. At that time,&#13;
discussions had just started about an IDA credit in support of the Korean railways. The Bank had&#13;
made two IDA credits to Korea, I believe, in the early '60s-small credits-and these credits&#13;
were not successful. In fact, Korea's economic performance since the Korean War had been very&#13;
disappointing. This had much to do with the political turmoil in Korea; people couldn't get their&#13;
act together. Things began to change when Park Chung Hee, a military man, took over the&#13;
government and in his authoritarian way lined up people and organized economic policies.&#13;
Matters soon began to change; the new policies were unleashing the energies and the&#13;
entrepreneurial spirit of the Korean people.&#13;
&#13;
We had some striking examples of this kind in our experience. The Koreans had been asking us&#13;
for highway loans, and the Bank, based on its experience at that time, was convinced that if you&#13;
were lending money for highway construction, you better prepare these projects very carefully.&#13;
So-and since this was a time-consuming and costly exercise, usually Involving all kinds of&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jochen Kraske&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    9&#13;

foreign international consultants, the Bank would initially give small credits as engineering&#13;
credits. These would cover the cost of feasibility studies and eventually also the detailed&#13;
engineering of projects before the Bank would come in and give the much larger loan for&#13;
highway construction.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: There were a few of those "S credits," I think they were called.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Maybe they were called "S credits." And so, when the Koreans came and said,&#13;
"You know, we want to go into highway construction and would like you to help us," we said,&#13;
"Okay, great. Let's do one of these engineering credits." And we looked at a bunch of roads that&#13;
were included in the priority list of the Koreans and arranged for feasibility studies and&#13;
preliminary engineering. And every time, when we would go and look at the implementation of&#13;
this project, the Koreans would come and ask that other roads be included, or substituted for the&#13;
roads that were included in the credit. We were baffled and would ask, "Why do you want to do&#13;
this? Have your priorities changed?" Until it turned out that they had already constructed the&#13;
initial batch of roads. In other words, implementation was well ahead of the feasibility and&#13;
engineering studies.&#13;
&#13;
I still remember, at one point the government of Korea decided--especially because of the&#13;
always-pending threat of a North Korean invasion-that they needed to have a fast highway link&#13;
between Seoul and Pusan in the south.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: For a quick getaway, if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: For a quick getaway, if necessary. So within a year, and without our involvement,&#13;
they had built a four-lane, limited-access autobahn extending clear across the entire country.&#13;
Within a year, from scratch! Included in this highway were stretches where the highway would&#13;
suddenly expand to 12 lanes or so, to serve as improvised landing strips for airplanes.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, the next problem were disasters because nobody knew how to drive fast, nor was the&#13;
vehicle fleet of Korea in a position to sustain high-speed travel over extended periods of time.&#13;
So cars would just bum up and crash.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Probably the quality of the cars at the time was not very good.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The quality of the cars, many of pre-World War vintage, was adequate to the quality&#13;
of infrastructure at the time. But all this goes to show that the energy of the Koreans-their will&#13;
to move and to improve their position-was just unstoppable. The right set of policies and the&#13;
right set of economic plans had suddenly unleashed this energy, and we were just amazed&#13;
spectators of what was going on.&#13;
&#13;
Our program was developing very quickly, and very quickly Korea turned from an IDA&#13;
borrower into a Bank borrower. But the history-at least this early history of our relationship&#13;
with Korea-was always characterized by the Bank trying to tell the Koreans to slow down, to&#13;
stop and think.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
I remember at one point the Koreans had decided to build a steel plant. Now, one of the key&#13;
features of Korea was that they were copying everything Japan had done. Yet, at the same time,&#13;
they hated nobody more than Japan because of the colonial experience that they had with Japan.&#13;
But in every respect, whether it was planning the Olympics, planning the annual meetings of the&#13;
Bank, planning their industrial development, the various steps-steel plants, shipyards,&#13;
automobiles-they were following slavishly the Japanese example. And so at one point they&#13;
decided, "Now we must have a steel plant."&#13;
&#13;
We said, "For God's sake, why would you want to build a steel plant? There's a surplus in the&#13;
world. All the steel plants are ailing. There's no market for all the steel."&#13;
&#13;
But the Koreans insisted, "We want our steel plant." And sure enough, they went ahead. They&#13;
built this giant steel plant at Pohang. And by the time the steel plant was completed, it was the&#13;
most efficient, the most state of the art steel plant in the world, and they were able to sell their&#13;
steel all over the world.&#13;

&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay, Jochen, before I had to change the tape, you were talking about Korea, and&#13;
you told me you wanted to add one more item regarding Korea.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yeah. There's one point that I should add. This coincided with my taking charge of&#13;
the division and occupied some of my early contacts with the Koreans, and also with other&#13;
donors.&#13;
&#13;
After the Korean War, Korea had been exclusively dependent on the United States. The United&#13;
States had extended generous amounts of aid to the Koreans, but by the end of the 1960s the&#13;
United States were understandably getting a bit tired of doing this and were looking and advising&#13;
the Koreans to look for other alternatives. One alternative was to make greater use of the World&#13;
Bank; so the Koreans would come to the World Bank. The other alternative was, of course, to&#13;
draw more heavily on Japanese assistance. The Japanese had set up some fund that in part was&#13;
meant to compensate Korea for the damage that they had inflicted on the country.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Not formal reparations, as such.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It was not a formal reparations fund. I don't think the Japanese ever acknowledged&#13;
any misdeeds. It was just a kind of de facto fund for development assistance specifically for the&#13;
benefit of Korea.&#13;
&#13;
So we were launching a consultative group for Korea, and it was within the framework of this&#13;
group also that the United States began to pull back a bit, and the Bank and Japan and other&#13;
donors were moving out front.&#13;
&#13;
It is interesting to note, maybe, that Taiwan was also a member of this consultative group as a&#13;
donor, not as a donor of vast capital funds, but as a provider of technical assistance. And the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
representative of Taiwan, who was a close friend of mine and of many people, in fact, in the&#13;
Bank, would come and attend these meetings. He had been a student in France and spoke French&#13;
fluently, and was not able to go to France because the French had early recognized Communist&#13;
China as the legitimate representative of China. Thus, for him this was a unique opportunity to&#13;
visit Paris in the guise of a member of this consultative group.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What was his name, Jochen?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Marty Wong.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Martin Wong. I've heard ofhim, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He was the minister here in the Chinese-Taiwanese--embassy for many years, and&#13;
then later, in the final stages of Beijing taking over, he was ambassador in Brussels. He retired&#13;
and lived here in Washington, and he died here, also.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Somebody told me he threw great parties and was a good cook.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, he would take you out to these Chinese restaurants, and it was wonderful to&#13;
see him operate. He would engage in extended discussions with the chef about, you know, what&#13;
we were going to eat and how he was going to prepare this, and all this, of course, in Chinese&#13;
and with a lot of theatrics. I still remember, several times we would go to some ofthe places here&#13;
in Chinatown, in D.C., and would end up in some bare room with just a bulb hanging from the&#13;
ceiling, a kitchen table, a bunch of kitchen chairs. But we would be served the most exquisite&#13;
Chinese food that these people were able to produce.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well speaking of China, the Republic of China, which is to say Taiwan, was also&#13;
making very good economic progress. By 1971, it had graduated from IDA, after IDA had made&#13;
4 credits to China and 14 IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] loans&#13;
totaling more than $300 million. What were your observations ofT aiwan at this time?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, Taiwan was a star performer. While Korea was coming up fast, Taiwan was&#13;
always ahead of Korea. And in way, what you could see was happening in Taiwan would be&#13;
followed later in Korea.&#13;
&#13;
Taiwan was remarkable, in particular, because it had the most spectacular establishment of&#13;
economic leaders, economic policymakers, engineers. These were all people who had come from&#13;
mainland China with the Kuomintang, and settled in Taiwan and applied their talent to this small&#13;
island nation with great success.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: They would have been mostly American-educated?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, in fact, I think they were largely European-educated. I still remember there&#13;
were a number of Chinese who had gone to German universities and were speaking German.&#13;
French was also very common, and there were some American-educated people. But I would&#13;
think that, by and large, given the vintage of these people-they had been going to school in the&#13;
&#13;

                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
post-World War I period, and I think the majority ofthem had gone to European universities, and&#13;
particularly continental Europe. I guess there was some reservation as far as Britain and its&#13;
colonial links in China at the time.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As we know, on May 15, 1980, the People's Republic of China assumed&#13;
representation as China in the World Bank Group. By then, you had been gone from the Region&#13;
for some time, but had you experienced anything of the controversies that underlay this switch in&#13;
representation?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No, I didn't. Of course, at the time when I dealt with Taiwan, talking about&#13;
mainland China was anathema. You did not talk about mainland China. It was understood that&#13;
Taiwan was China, and in all our pronouncements and our behavior we were totally focused on&#13;
Taiwan.&#13;
&#13;
I still remember there are these small islands that belong to Taiwan that are just off the coast of&#13;
China ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Quemoy and Matsu.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: .. Quemoy and Matsu, and in those days the mainland Chinese would bombard&#13;
these islands. But they would bombard these islands every other day at specific times. I mean,&#13;
you knew exactly when they would bomb and when they would not bomb. And so people would&#13;
go there and visit these islands. They were also at one point trying to persuade me to go and visit&#13;
one of these islands, but I declined. People had described to me how you had to fly in there&#13;
practically skimming the surface of the water to avoid the radar. But life on these islands was an&#13;
active part of Taiwan. The way that China and Taiwan dealt with these islands epitomized the&#13;
relationship with mainland China.&#13;
&#13;
Many people would refer to their background and history in China. Martin Wong, for instance-&#13;
and, I think, especially his wife-came from fairly important families in mainland China. They&#13;
were quite uncompromising in their opposition to the Communists. They would never consider&#13;
visiting there. They just couldn't visualize any kind of relationship or understanding with China.&#13;
Martin Wong would always make sure that the restaurants that he would choose for our dinners&#13;
would be politically close to the Taiwan dispensation of government. But in his final years-I&#13;
don't remember now; this must have been in the late '70s or maybe early '80s-he actually took&#13;
us once to a restaurant which he knew and we knew was mainland affiliated. So I think even he&#13;
started to soften in his opposition to the mainland.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So while you were in charge of the program in Taiwan, did you encounter any&#13;
problems?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No. The Taiwanese were just spectacular in the efficiency and orderliness with&#13;
which they would implement our programs. I mean, you never had any problem at all with any&#13;
of these projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I think what is also noteworthy is that in 1970, or thereabouts, we made a loan for a power&#13;
project in Kaohsiung, which is the southern port of Taiwan. This loan financed a 500-megawatt&#13;
unit, and that was the first 500-megawatt unit the Bank financed anywhere in the world. Of&#13;
course, nowadays 500-megawatt units are fairly common. You have 1,000-, 2,000-megawatt&#13;
units. But in those days, a 500-megawatt unit was totally uncommon in developing countries.&#13;
And that this project should be built in a country with a population of 12 million people rather&#13;
than in India with, whatever at that time, 500 million people, 600 million people, I thought was&#13;
quite remarkable, and reflected the forward-looking nature of the government and the advanced&#13;
state of the economy of Taiwan at the time.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In September 1971 you moved to the South Asia Department. What occasioned this&#13;
change in responsibilities?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, it was simply that they were looking for a new division chief in the India&#13;
Division.&#13;
&#13;
I remember at the time Reg [Reginald A.] Clarke, the Personnel Department head, came and said&#13;
that there were two openings. One was chief of the India Division, and the other was chief of a&#13;
division in Bill [William] Diamond's Development Finance Companies Department dealing with&#13;
DFCs [development finance companies] in Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Look, I don't need to think about this much; I'll take the India job."&#13;
&#13;
And Reg Clarke said, "Well, you should at least talk to Bill Diamond and discuss the job in his&#13;
department."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did you know Bill at that time?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I knew Bill fairly well, and I knew that he had been very eager to get me involved&#13;
with his programs. But I had really had no experience with DFC work. I had worked closely with&#13;
Bill Diamond in Korea when we set up the Korean DFC. And there was a very active DFC in&#13;
Taiwan, headed by a very shrewd and very suave fellow called Felix Chang.&#13;
&#13;
So in the context of working with these institutions, and in the case of Korea setting up the&#13;
institution, I had worked fairly closely with Bill Diamond; he decided that he wanted to attract&#13;
me into his sphere. I sometimes wonder what might have happened if I had taken that job.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I would like to get your impressions of the contrasts in working with India in your&#13;
first phase of involvement in that country and your previous experience in East Asia. For&#13;
instance, in 1960 India and Korea were at the same level of income. Within the next 40 years,&#13;
Korea became 25 times richer than India. Japan and Taiwan were, of course, also notably&#13;
successful. How would you compare working with the government in India in the 1970s and&#13;
your previous experience in East Asia?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, to start with, I have to say that my involvement with India preceded my&#13;
assignment to the India Division.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, right. Shall we discuss the Bell Mission, because that's a significant chapter&#13;
in the Bank's history? Maybe we'll just backtrack for a moment.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right, yeah. This was in '64. As a Young Professional, I was drafted to join the Bell&#13;
Mission. That was a fairly sizeable, well-staffed mission which went to India in September 1964.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What occasioned the Bell Mission?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, the occasion for the Bell Mission was that the donors-in particular the&#13;
United States and in particular Lyndon [B.] Johnson, the president of the United States-had&#13;
become tired and frustrated with India and India's economic performance. India, after&#13;
independence, was a paragon of economic performance and a model for everybody as far as&#13;
administration and planned development is concerned. Everybody would flock to India to sit at&#13;
the feet of Indian policymakers and economists to find out what they did and how they did it.&#13;
The Indians were extremely smart. All these administrators were high-powered intellectuals,&#13;
often quite arrogant, who had been trained in Oxford and Cambridge and joined the ICS [Indian&#13;
Civil Service], which had been an elite service.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Indian Civil Service.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: An elite civil service established by the British in India. [Jawaharlal] Nehru, India's&#13;
first prime minister, was a charismatic leader of the Indian polity, and unfortunately somebody&#13;
also who thought that he knew more about certain things than he actually did. The economy was&#13;
one of the subjects which he felt that he knew much about but, in fact, really didn't. I think his&#13;
decisions have greatly retarded India's economic progress.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: By that, you would say the heavily socialist orientation?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The emphasis on pervasive government control and on public ownership of&#13;
economic enterprises. I think there was-and this was both an obsession of [Mohandas K.]&#13;
Gandhi and Nehru-there was a feeling that the boundless entrepreneurial spirit and energy of&#13;
the Indians, which is so manifest all over the world-wherever you run into Indians, you can see&#13;
this-that this was going to be a problem, that this was going to deepen income differentials&#13;
between rich and poor. And, hence, the efforts of the government needed to limit and contain&#13;
these entrepreneurial instincts. The whole system of regulations and policies was designed to&#13;
frustrate decision-making and to hold up matters.&#13;
&#13;
This-and the other aspect that has been a real problem in India is this litigious approach to life.&#13;
It has never been quite clear to me where this comes from. It is common throughout South Asia,&#13;
you know, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan-all former British colonies-they all suffer&#13;
from the same problem. Once you move further east to Thailand and so on, to where the Chinese&#13;
have played a dominant role, it disappears. But in India, every Indian somewhere has this instinct&#13;
that he has to stand up and fight for his or her rights and go to the brink. This is causing no end&#13;
of problems. It is most manifest, of course, in all these labor disputes, and disputes over land&#13;
ownership.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 15&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
By the late 1950s, India had started to run into difficulties. It had run out of foreign exchange&#13;
reserves, which it had inherited initially when it became independent from Britain. And it was, in&#13;
addition, facing a number of very poor agricultural years. So as a result, starting in 1958, the&#13;
Indian balance of payments was in real trouble.&#13;
&#13;
This was when the World Bank formed the India Consortium, initially on a sort of informal basis&#13;
when President [Eugene R.] Black was calling together the Executive Directors representing&#13;
donor countries and raising around the table money that could go to India to help cover the&#13;
country's balance of payments need. This soon became an institutionalized effort. Every year&#13;
donors would get together and look at India's performance, and cover India's projected needs.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Wasn't that the first Bank consortium?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This was the first Bank consortium, and it was the first consortium as distinct from&#13;
the more informal consultative groups which became a tool of aid coordination later on. Pakistan&#13;
followed suit very quickly. So there were only two consortia, India and Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
The characteristics of these consortia were that the participating donors underwrote the balance&#13;
of payments deficit of the client country. This put enormous pressure on the donor members of&#13;
these consortia. So when, later in the 1960s, the idea of aid coordination became more&#13;
prominent, and more prominent in a larger number of countries, donors absolutely refused to&#13;
follow the model that had been established for India and Pakistan, and instead opted for a more&#13;
loose form of consultations. Hence the name "consultative group," as distinct from&#13;
"consortium," which did not imply any commitment to provide certain amounts of assistance to&#13;
achieve certain objectives.&#13;
&#13;
But, as I said, by the early 1960s people were beginning to ask questions and were wondering&#13;
how much longer this was supposed to go on, and why did India's economic performance not&#13;
improve despite the generous amounts of aid that had been provided. There were many critical&#13;
stories about, you know, projects not being built, projects not working, aid funds not disbursing.&#13;
By 1964, this reached a climax, where donors just insisted they wanted some answers. It was, in&#13;
particular, Lyndon Johnson, who had at that time been called upon to provide, on an emergency&#13;
basis, increasing amounts of food to bail out India, in addition to large amounts of aid, and who&#13;
was getting very fed up.&#13;
&#13;
So there was the notion that the Bank, as an impartial observer, would mount a mission to&#13;
investigate what was happening, make recommendations as to what policies needed to be&#13;
changed, and make some prognostication as to what amount and form of aid was needed to&#13;
support the next five year plan. This mission had been explained to the Indians, but the Indians,&#13;
of course, were less than pleased by this development. The Indian papers were full of criticism of&#13;
the Bank and the attempt of outside interference. There was great sensitivity in India concerning&#13;
any foreign criticism, based on the colonial history of foreign interference. This proposed&#13;
mission seemed to be a striking example of this kind of unwanted interference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How did George Woods view this? Because he fancied himself, as I recall, as&#13;
something of an India expert. He had had some involvement in India, and felt himself to be a&#13;
friend oflndia, I think it's fair to say.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Oh, yeah. He was a-he was a real Indophile. This was based on his involvement in&#13;
India in the 1950s as a consultant for the World Bank. He had been there on two occasions. One,&#13;
in the mid-1950s, he had been sent to India by the World Bank to examine the entire steel&#13;
industry of India, in part with a view to indicating areas where the Bank might provide&#13;
assistance. Then, later, he was instrumental in the setting up of a development bank in India,&#13;
ICICI [Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation oflndia, Limited].&#13;
&#13;
Now, this bank soon ran into problems, and he went back in 1958 and devised the measures and&#13;
programs to reform the bank, and it was then that he came on the board ofiCICL He also&#13;
decided that the Bank should send an adviser to work with ICICI, and this was Bill Diamond,&#13;
who spent a year in Bombay wor~ing with ICICL Today ICICI is India's most important bank. It&#13;
has totally overshadowed all the other commercial banks, and it is operating on a global scale.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: But George Woods was well disposed towards the Bell idea?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: During his visits, he had met all these Indian industrialists and leaders, and was&#13;
absolutely charmed by them. There is correspondence in the Bank's archives, the letters that he&#13;
exchanged with his Indian friends-the Tatas and the Birlas-and you can tell there was a&#13;
warmth that you don't normally associate with Woods. But he took a very personal liking and&#13;
interest in them, in their lives and in their activities.&#13;
&#13;
So it was in a way ironic that when he became the head of the World Bank in 1963 that he would&#13;
be immediately confronted with this crisis. I'm sure it was not easy for him to accept this critical&#13;
role. Yet at the same time, he felt a sense of commitment to India, and saw the need that things&#13;
had to be done differently, and so he was supportive of this mission.&#13;
&#13;
In due course, this ruined his reputation as a friend India, and I'm sure it must have been very&#13;
painful for him to find himself kind of castigated by many of his Indian friends as a severe critic.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Neo-imperialist, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It was quickly decided that there was need for a high-caliber person to run this&#13;
mission. I don't know who the various people were that were considered. By the time I was asked&#13;
to join, Bernie Bell, who was then an economic consultant here in the Washington area who had&#13;
his own private firm, had been hired. I think his background was originally with the Export-&#13;
Import Bank here in the United States. He had spent quite some time in Indonesia in the 1950s,&#13;
and was very fond of Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He later became head of the Djakarta resident mission for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. I remember I had many conversations with him while we were on this&#13;
mission in India, and he would always compare the problems that he had in India with the&#13;
situation in Indonesia. He was obviously very frustrated by this experience in India.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, he had been appointed to head this mission, and started to form various groups that&#13;
would look at the different sectors of the economy. In particular, I might mention that he had a&#13;
very prominent and powerful agricultural team on this mission headed QY Sir John Crawford,&#13;
who was an Australian. He had had a great career in the Australian civil service and had been, I&#13;
believe, the father of the rationing system in Australia during the war.&#13;
&#13;
It also included a fellow called WolfLadejinsky, who was a land reform expert who had been&#13;
working with [General Douglas] MacArthur in Japan and designed the Japanese land reform,&#13;
which was considered a model. There was also [W.] David Hopper, who at that time was already&#13;
posted in India with the Rockefeller Foundation, who joined this group.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He later became a Bank vice president.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes. And then there was a fellow called Louis [M.] Goreux, who was a Frenchman&#13;
who came from FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization] and was dealing with the econometric&#13;
aspects of agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, in addition, there were a whole bunch of other people. There was Stanley Please, who&#13;
was looking after the fiscal side. There was Jean Baneth, who was a contemporary of mine,&#13;
although he was not a Young Professional. He took on the examination of the Indian system of&#13;
economic controls. There was a guy who was dealing with exports by the name ofDavid [G.]&#13;
Holland.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was Stanley Please at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He was in the Economics Department, dealing with fiscal affairs.&#13;
&#13;
It was fairly large group of people, and we moved to India in September of '64 and stayed in&#13;
India until about April the following year, and then came back to Washington to write our report.&#13;
By the end of '65 the report had been put together.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were you in New Delhi at the time, or did you travel all around?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: We were stationed in New Delhi, but we were, of course, traveling.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were probably the junior person on the team.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes, and since I was not an expert of any kind, I had to deal with the administrative&#13;
side of the mission, which largely consisted of going to the Ministry of Finance and trying to&#13;
extricate all kinds of documents and papers from the government. So I became acquainted with&#13;
all these officers in the Department of Economic Affairs. It was interesting, and characteristic of&#13;
their unhappiness with our mission, that they would hang on to everything they could possibly&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
hang on to. Sometimes we found that there were published documents, and they would make a&#13;
big song and dance about releasing those published documents to us.&#13;
&#13;
Everybody was clearly watching this whole mission with a sense of trying to minimize damage&#13;
and interaction. Willing cooperation was not what characterized this relationship. It was reluctant&#13;
acceptance.&#13;
&#13;
Now at the more seriior levels, the people that Bernie Bell would talk to--the various ministers&#13;
and secretaries--of course, these people understood that this mission was not an invention of&#13;
Bernie Bell or George Woods and their critical disposition, but was really something that was&#13;
intricately related to the aid flows that India needed and depended on.&#13;
&#13;
I, of course, left this mission activity after we had written the first draft of the report-this must&#13;
have been like in September or October of '65-and followed what was going on from a&#13;
distance, and from what I could later in my career as a division chief or as historian see in the&#13;
files.&#13;
&#13;
This whole exercise was really not very productive, precisely because there was no meeting of&#13;
the minds between the Bank and the Indian government.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Indians were reluctant in the first place, and resisted the whole idea of&#13;
economic reform.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: They were reluctant in the first place. And the key issues and the key reform&#13;
proposals were very serious and touching on axioms that in India at that time were considered&#13;
immovable, and related to the whole philosophy of Nehru which had been adopted by ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: By his successors.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: By his daughter [Indira Gandhi], who was then prime minister and who was not, you&#13;
know, an independent thiriker of her own. She was a very clever political manipulator, but she&#13;
was not a great intellect.&#13;
&#13;
In the end, the reform proposals were boiled down to certain key items, and devaluation was&#13;
clearly one of these signal items. The value of the currency at the time in India was still&#13;
considered kind of an emblem of national pride, and devaluation represented a loss of face in the&#13;
context in which it was discussed. So it was accepted most reluctantly. And, of course, all the&#13;
concomitant changes that were needed for the pricing system to work better and to achieve&#13;
greater efficiency didn't take place.&#13;
&#13;
So in the end, what happened was making no difference or little difference and left everybody&#13;
frustrated. It kept the aid flowing. One of the recommendations was quid pro quo for non-project&#13;
assistance. The Consortium would provide a certain volume of non-project assistance, that is to&#13;
say cash, once the government adopted the agreed reforms.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did I understand you to say that the reforms were not really implemented?&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, the currency was devalued, and wherever you could point to agreed specific&#13;
changes, those changes were made. But for these changes to make sense, what was needed was a&#13;
much more fundamental rethinking and reforming of economic policies of the kind which finally&#13;
took place in 1991. Of course, the Indian officials claimed that the promised assistance never&#13;
materialized and that this doomed the whole process.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, we were talking about the Bell Mission, and before that I had just touched&#13;
briefly on the differences between working in Korea and India. In 1960, India and Korea were at&#13;
the same level of income, but later, of course, Korea far outdistanced India in economic&#13;
development. So what I'm wondering is, are there some impressions that you might have had&#13;
about the differences of working with a country like Korea versus India?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, one of the differences clearly is related to the language. I mean, while the&#13;
people that you deal with in either country obviously are able to speak to you in English, English&#13;
in India is much more a common language than it would be in Korea. And much of what takes&#13;
place when you deal with Koreans takes place in a medium that you don't understand, that you&#13;
don't really have access to.&#13;
&#13;
And the same is also true as far as the culture is concerned between people in East Asia and in&#13;
South Asia. The Indians wear their hearts on their sleeves. They are always ready to share their&#13;
thoughts with you, especially if they disagree with you, they will make no bones about this and&#13;
be very up front.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, Amartya Sen's new book is The Argumentative Indian.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. And in a way, this is both a source of frustration-and I have seen many&#13;
people in the Bank becoming very frustrated, especially those technical people who are&#13;
expecting to see their recommendations accepted without argument. They become very frustrated&#13;
when they find that everything they suggest is being questioned and taken apart.&#13;
&#13;
Now, in East Asia people are very reticent and very polite. It is not polite to disagree with you. It&#13;
is their culture to be very reserved and to keep their own private sphere absolutely to themselves,&#13;
and not share this with you. So even when you know people over a long period of time and .&#13;
believe you have established a relationship of trust, you suddenly find on occasion that you're&#13;
actually miles apart, that the perceptions that these people have are totally different from your&#13;
own perception and that there is no real meeting of the minds.&#13;
&#13;
Typically, when you negotiate with the Indians, you have a very hard time to reach agreement,&#13;
but once you have reached agreement, you can be somewhat confident that everybody will stick&#13;
to the agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                   RESTRICTED&#13;
                                                                  WBG ARCHIVES&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  JUN 1 8 2012                      20&#13;
                                                             Exception 1'.' [~v-cz /;r,   Â·Â·A-dÂ·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I think the contrast between India and these East Asian countries is essentially one of culture.&#13;
I've always compared the Indians with the Americans. I think in many ways they're very similar,&#13;
and one of the similarities is that both are as sensitive to any criticism expressed about them as&#13;
they are insensitive about expressing criticism about others. The Indians, you know, are known&#13;
for standing up and disagreeing vigorously if they feel like it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Disagree?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: With other people, in public, which is one of the reasons. why the relationship with&#13;
the United States has been as rocky as it has been in the past. At the same time, the Indians are&#13;
extremely sensitive to any expression of criticism directed against them or their behavior. So this&#13;
has always encumbered the dialogue. Now, once you gain their confidence, and once they begin&#13;
to believe that you're not out take advantage of them, they will listen to you, they will trust you&#13;
and share their constraints with you. In that sense I felt working with India never frustrating. I've&#13;
always felt that my interaction .with Indians of all walks of life has been an enriching experience,&#13;
and has taught me a lot.&#13;
&#13;
One of the things that I've observed, going through my career in the Bank, was the affinity&#13;
people developed for certain countries. When people join the Bank, especially young people&#13;
coming from Western countries and first get exposed to the problems of developing countries,&#13;
they kind of get marked. So, Young Professionals, in particular, who went on their first missions&#13;
to Africa would become lifelong friends of Africa and have a particular affinity for African&#13;
problems and African experience. Likewise, people working with India, in particular, or China or&#13;
East Asia would be marked by that initial experience and see everything from the perspective of&#13;
those countries.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You had mentioned Peter Cargill. He had quite a history in the Bank. I believe he&#13;
was born in India, had something of an Indian background. What were your impressions of him,&#13;
because he was a fairly well-known figure in the early history of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I liked him. He was an exceedingly bright, very shrewd person. He was born&#13;
in Masoori, a hill station in Uttar Pradesh, not too far from Delhi. His father was an official in the&#13;
Indian railways. He went to Oxford, I believe, and joined the ICS. He was very British in many&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ways, but with the ability of humorous detachment. So he could be very funny, and could also be&#13;
very warm. I've always admired him and appreciated his friendship. He was also a bit of a&#13;
scoundrel, and recognized this very much himself. So one of his favorite books was Flashman by&#13;
[George MacDonald] Fraser.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Not the Flashman series.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yeah, the Flashman series. I think he likened himself a bit to Flashman. And there&#13;
were clearly elements in his character that were Flashman-esque.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was there anyone else in the Region at that time who made a particular impression&#13;
on you?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: When I first joined the South Asia Department, the head of it was a Canadian fellow&#13;
by the name of Escott Reid. He also liked to describe himself as an old India hand.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He had been Canadian ambassador in India.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He had been Canadian high commissioner in Delhi. He had also been ambassador in&#13;
Bonn at some point.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes. As an aside, he has written a book, Ambassador to Nehru [Reid, Escott.&#13;
Ambassador to Nehru. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981], which you would find&#13;
interesting. He was department director for South Asia for a few years.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: When I joined, he was the head of the department. He was kind man and interested&#13;
in what we were doing. But he was not a great development expert. I came to know him a little&#13;
better. After he retired, he would often come and visit Delhi for extended periods oftime; he&#13;
would come and visit the office in Delhi when I was the resident representative.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Escott Reid?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Escott Reid. He had a son, Pat [Patrick M. Reid], who later became Executive&#13;
Director in the Bank. I suppose he must have been in the Canadian government. I think Escott at&#13;
some point became president of some university in Canada.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Up in Canada. Yes, that rings a belL Well, he wrote an autobiography, too, which&#13;
is called Radical Mandarin [Reid, Escott. Radical Mandarin. Toronto: University of Toronto&#13;
Press, 1989]. So you might be interested in that one, too.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He also wrote a book about the Bank and how it should be reformed.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Strengthening the World Bank, I think, was the title [Reid, Escott. Strengthening&#13;
the World Bank. Chicago: Adlai Stevenson Institute oflntemational Affairs, 1973].&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
On July 1, 1975, you became chief of the Bank's resident mission in New Delhi. How did that&#13;
come about?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I had been chief of the India Division and, of course, had a close relationship with&#13;
India and with the people there. It was natural that I would want to go to India and live there for&#13;
a while, and become res rep [resident representative].&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: But were you offered the post, or did you ask for it?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I had asked for it. I talked to Peter Cargill about it, and I think he agreed with it and&#13;
must have persuaded McNamara to agree.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was it a division chief-level position at that time?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes, it was a division chief-level position. Later it was even above division chief&#13;
level, but I think as India Division chief, I was already in the front rank anyway. In any event,&#13;
going to Delhi did not involve promotion, as far as I can recall. It was really a wonderful&#13;
assignment, and I loved it. Of course, I was very friendly with my predecessor there, [William&#13;
M.] Gilmartin, a brilliant economist, who had been running this office before, and then had gone&#13;
back again. I was also very close to his deputy, Bilsel Alisbah, who then, in fact, came back to&#13;
Washington and took my place as chief of the India Division.&#13;
&#13;
The problem was that when I was given this job of heading the office in Delhi, there was also a&#13;
need of totally re-staffing the office. Gilmartin, who had been the principal economist, had left.&#13;
While I had studied economics, I had not worked as an economist. I had been a loan officer and&#13;
manager in the Bank but not an analyst, and was not in a position to write on my own economic&#13;
analyses and reports ofthe country.&#13;
&#13;
Then the deputy chief, Bilsel Alisbah, went back to take my post. The chief administrative&#13;
person from headquarters, Ursula Zieschang, decided to leave the Bank at the time.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: She was a friend of Betty Kinsey's, too.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, she left the Bank because she had become a devotee of [Jiuddu] Krishnamurti,&#13;
some religious guru in California. Anyway, within a year, she was disenchanted and came back&#13;
and, in fact, rejoined the mission for another year.&#13;
&#13;
Then there was an Indian staff member who was extremely effective both as an administrator&#13;
and a social secretary. Her name was Kuku Johri. Her husband, Madan [M.] Johri, who had been&#13;
with the Navy and then worked for the Ford Foundation in Delhi, wanted to have a job in the&#13;
Bank. Gilmartin and Cargill had engineered a loan officer position in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He was Indian?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes, he was Indian. As a result, his wife up and left and went to Washington. So&#13;
here I was, without an economist, without the support of an experienced deputy, without an&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
administrative manager, without the key Indian person to help me get in touch. I had to fill all&#13;
these positions.&#13;
&#13;
The first I found was the economist, and that was Oktay Yenal, who happily decided to come&#13;
and join.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He was already in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He was in the Bank. He was in the fiscal division of the Development Economics&#13;
Department, and he was a very experienced economist.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What country was he from?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I thought so, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: And at the time, he happened to be in Turkey, so we had to reach him somewhere by&#13;
telephone and negotiate this whole deal.&#13;
&#13;
After I got to India--! had cast around and find somebody who would handle the whole office&#13;
management and also my social relations. I came across Bim [Bimla] Bissell, and she happily&#13;
decided to come and join, and she was a great asset to the mission, not so much as a manager,&#13;
which was not her bag, but as a socially and politically astute person, somebody who knew what&#13;
was happening around the country in politics and in the government.&#13;
&#13;
Gradually the mission took shape. Eventually we also found a very good agricultural person,&#13;
Bengt [A.] Nekby, who was a Swede who was in the Bank, and he came and joined us. So we&#13;
had a wonderful team.&#13;
&#13;
One of the aspects of this first tour in India was that I was, of course, at that time still fairly&#13;
young, with little children who came with us and who started to go to the American Embassy&#13;
school. I was contemporary with most of the other members of the expatriate staff in the mission,&#13;
and so we were operating in a very collegial manner. We spent a great deal oftime together,&#13;
doing things together, traveling together, working and bringing up our kids. This was quite&#13;
different from my later assignment, when I came as an older and a more senior person in a way.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Backtracking just slightly, in February 1973 you wrote what I believe was the first&#13;
of what became a series of papers over the years on the role ofthe New Delhi office. What was&#13;
the genesis of that paper?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I suppose that must have been a question that came up. The role of the resident&#13;
mission has clearly evolved over time. When the office opened-this was in 1957-it was&#13;
clearly with a view to facilitating the annual meeting which took place in 1958 in Delhi. But it&#13;
also reflected the Bank's kind of engagement in India. So the Bank sent a Czech economist,&#13;
[Antonin] Basch. He was by himself, and was performing liaison functions. This pretty much&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
remained the role ofthe mission until the early '60s when Ben [Benjamin B.] King was there,&#13;
together with a young Italian economist, Romano Pantanali.&#13;
&#13;
Ben King, of course, is a brilliant economist. He delighted in having these acerbic exchanges&#13;
with the Indian economic gurus of the day. They respected him, but at the same time they also&#13;
resented his critical attitude. I remember, as part of this Bell Mission exercise he wrote a report&#13;
on planning in India, a scathing indictment of the relevance of the Planning Commission, which&#13;
was a hallowed institution in India at the time, with very powerful and prominent people on top.&#13;
The report was discussed, but in the end it was suppressed. It never saw the light of day. It did&#13;
not become part of the package of the Bell reports that were issued. That was Ben King who, you&#13;
know, in his position as res rep also participated in the Bell Mission.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Let me just mention one thing. The Indians weren't too thrilled about the&#13;
stablishment of the resident mission, as I recall. Is that pretty much correct?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I don't know that they had any problems with the initial resident mission. I suppose&#13;
they understood that it was needed to facilitate communications. After all, Â·the government&#13;
initially hosted the mission. It was providing office space in the Reserve Bank.&#13;
&#13;
But the situation changed very much in the aftermath ofthe Bell Mission, when George Woods&#13;
decided-and the Consortium at large decided-that it was important to have some eyes and ears&#13;
on the ground. In other words, what had been a representative office-liaison office-now&#13;
became an office that was supposed to gather intelligence, if you will; I mean, reporting&#13;
regularly on economic developments and policymaking.&#13;
&#13;
Gilmartin became the head of that office, and the office was staffed with a whole bunch of bright&#13;
economists. Jean Baneth was there, Ken [Kenneth A.] Bohr, [Robert] Picciotto, Bill [WilliamS.]&#13;
Humphrey. There was a whole host of experienced people, maybe as many as ten different&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
The size of the office, the number of staff members posted in Delhi, was very much a matter of&#13;
contention with the Indians. They recognized the character of this office, and were concerned&#13;
about the elevated profile of the Bank. The Indian bureaucrats were always extremely sensitive&#13;
to the risk of anything spilling into the press and causing major political flare-ups.&#13;
&#13;
This was not unrealistic. The Indian press, especially the left-wing press, were just waiting to&#13;
seize upon anything that indicated that control was not entirely in the hands of the government of&#13;
India, but in the hands of all kinds of foreign powers. This later took the form that whenever we&#13;
wanted to have more people in the resident mission, we had to go through an elaborate process of&#13;
negotiation with the bureaucrats in the Economics Affairs Department and explain why we&#13;
needed these people and what the India was going to gain by having these people.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, from the original liaison function the office became an economic watchdog-type office.&#13;
By the time I moved to Delhi in the mid-1970s, another shift took place, and that was that the&#13;
office became more project-oriented and more operationally relevant. We had increasing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
numbers of technical experts, agricultural people in particular, but also some industrial&#13;
economists. Later we added health and family planning people.&#13;
&#13;
I remember when I was there on my first innings, McNamara insisted that we had to have a&#13;
family planning expert. But I found at some point that this expert wasn't really fully utilized&#13;
because we had just one project there, and one person devoted to the supervision of this project.&#13;
As far as reporting on population issues, there was much that was published on family planning&#13;
in India that could be picked up by some of the other economists. Several times I tried to get that&#13;
position freed; McNamara wouldn't hear about it. It was his decision to have this one person&#13;
devoted to family planning.&#13;
&#13;
There was another change that took place the end of my tour in India, which had very profound&#13;
consequences for the size and the character of the office.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which one, which tour?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The first tour. This change was that we began to hire local consultants. And, of&#13;
course, you know, at that time the budget in the Bank became more of a constraint. The&#13;
resources that you were given to do your program were limited, and you had to sort of make&#13;
difficult choices. And, in particular, the number of positions that you had been given was strictly&#13;
limited. And so what I said was, "Look," I mean, "why don't we just get as much consulting&#13;
funds as we possibly can and then we go into the Indian market and we hire," you know, "as&#13;
many people as we want?" because, you know, in those days you paid maybe one-tenth as much&#13;
for Indian staff as you would pay for international staff.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And you found the requisite level of expertise, also?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: If anything, the expertise was better. We would hire retired senior government&#13;
officials who would be happy to come and work with us and get this salary on top of their&#13;
meager civil service pension. This worked wonderfully; not only did we get the expertise, but&#13;
also people who could work inside the government.&#13;
&#13;
In no time the Budget Department, or P and B [Programming and Budgeting], as it was called in&#13;
those days in the Bank, got wise and insisted that these people would have to be part of the&#13;
approved staffing complement. We were no longer free to just add long-term consultants funded&#13;
out of our consulting budget.&#13;
&#13;
So while this started as a short-lived matter of budgetary expediency, it transformed the nature of&#13;
the mission from one that was exclusively staffed by headquarters staff sent to India for a limited&#13;
period of time, to a mission that involved increasing numbers of native staff who were working&#13;
in the office on a long-term basis.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, were those people local hires as opposed to consultants, then?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: They would become local hires eventually, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: National staff.&#13;
&#13;
  KRASKE: Yes, national staff. They were particularly concentrated in the agriculture work&#13;
  program, which is where the Resident Mission had growing responsibility for project&#13;
, supervision. There was, for instance, a sizeable group of local staff dealing with procurement&#13;
 problems.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What was the role of local staff, primarily?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, at the time when I joined the mission in '75, we had, I think, two junior&#13;
economists, I mean, more like economic assistants. They would help our economists gather and&#13;
organize data. And other than that, all we had was local support staff and, I should say, excellent&#13;
support staff.&#13;
&#13;
We were able to attract a lot of women and housewives who were highly educated, very skillful,&#13;
who otherwise found it difficult to find work. Our pay scale was very attractive, and I think local&#13;
staff were also not taxed. So working for the World Bank was very attractive. So we had a whole&#13;
group of secretaries who were extremely competent and very devoted to their work. Unlike the&#13;
UNDP [United Nations Development Programme], with a very large local staff recruited in a&#13;
manner more like a government department, we never had any labor disputes whatsoever.&#13;
&#13;
Often, senior people would come from headquarters and try to recruit our staff. I remember at&#13;
one point Mahbub ul-Haq was visiting, and using my secretary. He was so impressed with her&#13;
work that he wanted to take her to Washington right away.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Ul-Haq was the Pakistani head of the Policy Planning and Program Review&#13;
department.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: When he was going home, he said, "I want to take your secretary with me. Would&#13;
you mind?" I said, "By all means, try." But in those days there were many obstacles to bringing&#13;
local staff into the organization and tum them into regular staff.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How would you characterize the relations between the resident mission and&#13;
headquarters, and did the character of these relations change between your first tour in New&#13;
Delhi and your second?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: During my two tours the resident mission reported to head of the department dealing&#13;
with India, and to some extent the vice president. This was in contrast to some other resident&#13;
missions. Indonesia is a prime example where, you know, Bernie Bell was reigning supreme&#13;
with direct access to the president of the Bank and often bypassing the entire bureaucratic&#13;
structure ofthe Bank. We always felt that we were part of the establishment.&#13;
&#13;
This, of course, has changed in the meantime; authority was delegated to the head of the resident&#13;
mission, and now the country director in India is running things from the field. But in those days,&#13;
both during my first and my second inning, decision-making was clearly reserved to&#13;
headquarters, and there was never any dispute about this, or any argument about this.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                               27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Of course, our relations were fine. The people that I reported to or worked with were people that&#13;
I always had much respect for, and also close friendship with.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So, basically, the relations were fairly smooth and consistent over time, you would&#13;
say?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I don't recall any occasion where we were at loggerheads over any issues.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How would you characterize the relations between the resident mission and other&#13;
aid donors, and with the IMF?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, the IMF in my days was non-existent. There was no IMF program in India,&#13;
and there was nobody stationed in India. So the IMF was never a contending partner&#13;
&#13;
As far as the other donors are concerned, I kept in touch with the various embassies there; we&#13;
would have occasional meetings. We would meet usually close to the meetings ofthe&#13;
Consortium, so that our colleagues in the embassies could brief their headquarters on what was&#13;
coming up. But this was also something that the Indians were very sensitive about. They were&#13;
always concerned about collusion and people ganging up on them. Any formal mechanism of aid&#13;
coordination at the local level, which would have to involve also the Indian bureaucrats to some&#13;
extent, was discouraged.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Today is March 13, 2006. My name is Charles Ziegler, a consultant with the World&#13;
Bank Group Oral History Program. I am at the home of Mr. Jochen Kraske in Bethesda,&#13;
Maryland, to conduct the second session of his oral history interview.&#13;
&#13;
Jochen, thank you for having me back. We were discussing India and your involvement there.&#13;
We were talking specifically about the relations between the resident mission, other aid donors,&#13;
and the IMF in India.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, as I said, there was little interaction with the IMF, simply because the IMF&#13;
was not involved with India at that time. India had been always very deliberate in trying not to&#13;
have a program with the IMF, with all the pertaining conditionalities and commitments to be&#13;
reviewed and discussed. So there was no IMF presence in India at the time. The IMF, of course,&#13;
participated in the Consortium, and kept a running brief on what was going on in India in line&#13;
with its Article 4, but India did not receive assistance from the IMF, and therefore the IMF&#13;
involvement in India was very peripheral.&#13;
&#13;
The Resident Mission, of course, maintained contact with the various embassies of donor&#13;
countries, and particularly with the embassies of the Consortium members. But there was no&#13;
formal system of interacting and coordinating with these other donors. That would have been&#13;
frowned upon by the Indian administration.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You told me last time they were pretty sensitive.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The Indians were really almost paranoid about the notion that donors could collude&#13;
and try to impose conditions. The coordination mechanism of the Consortium was something&#13;
that they tolerated just barely, because it facilitated the mobilization of needed assistance. But&#13;
any close contact among the donors, or between India and the donors when it came to discussing&#13;
policy matters, was clearly disapproved of. So while there was informal contact, of course, with&#13;
the representatives of the various donors ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's between you and the embassies?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes. Nothing like regular meetings, nothing like regular exchanges of information&#13;
about the state of the economy or progress of lending activities took place.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Everybody was more or less doing their own thing. Did that lead to a lot of&#13;
overlap?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No. I would have to say here that the Indians had a very well-functioning, well-&#13;
established administration, and they were really capable of coordinating whatever assistance was&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jochen Kraske&#13;
                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
coming to India. Within the Ministry of Finance, and specifically the Department ofEconomic&#13;
Affairs-which was responsible for all the aid receipts-there were the different divisions or&#13;
sub-heads that dealt with the various donors. Within the Ministry of Finance there was clearly&#13;
coordination about which sectors and which states the various donors were going to cover and&#13;
how they were going to work in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
You have to also understand that of course India was a federal country, and much of the&#13;
assistance provided by the donors did not go to the federal government-to Delhi-but to the&#13;
various states of the union. This presented a bit of a problem. Initially, the Indian government,&#13;
having its five-year plans and the corresponding plans to finance these investment programs, had&#13;
a system that was based on the notion that the totality of all the resources going to the states from&#13;
the center would be covered by these plans. In other words, if an aid donor came into India with&#13;
funds destined to be lent to a particular state, these funds were subsumed into the allocation of&#13;
plan resources from the center to the particular state.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So the center was aware of what was going to the states?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes, and what the states were getting from the donors was not additional, in the&#13;
terms of the parlance of the government of India at the time. It was part of the central plan&#13;
allocation to the states. Yet, the states had no particular reason to look for foreign assistance.&#13;
They would receive local resources from the central government regardless of whether a project&#13;
was aid-fmanced or supported by the central government because it formed part of the five-year&#13;
plan. Since aid resources inevitably are more complicated to handle because of the various donor&#13;
requirements that have to be met before funds can be disbursed, it was more cumbersome to&#13;
receive these resources in the form of some foreign assistance program-a loan from the World&#13;
Bank or USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development].&#13;
&#13;
The result was that states were reluctant to let donors get involved in the financing of their&#13;
projects. This eventually meant that large amounts of aid were not utilized, or even if they had&#13;
been committed, they did not disburse, and India did not receive the foreign transfers it needed to&#13;
cover the country's import requirements.&#13;
&#13;
The central government then had to devise a system to give incentives to the states to attract&#13;
foreign assistance. This was done by making increasing proportions of the foreign assistance that&#13;
went to the states additional to the approved level of central government plan financing. In other&#13;
words, if a state received X amount of resources from the center under the five-year plan&#13;
arrangement for investment, to the extent that the state absorbed foreign assistance, the state was&#13;
getting some extra money. This proportion increased as time went on, until at some point the&#13;
notion of additionality was given up altogether, and all foreign assistance absorbed by states&#13;
became additional.&#13;
&#13;
This, of course, created further complications because inevitably there are some very efficient&#13;
states, states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, or Punjab and Haryana, and some ofthe southern states,&#13;
like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and there are other states who are hopelessly behind, like Bihar&#13;
and UP [Uttar Pradesh], and West Bengal or Orissa. So, when the rules of the game started to&#13;
change, these states tended to lose out. It was the more progressive states that were able to take&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   30&#13;

advantage of the additional resources that became available and absorbed increasing proportions&#13;
of the foreign assistance that came to India. The government of India had to try to devise all sorts&#13;
of ways to channel additional funds into these more backward states.&#13;
&#13;
Needless to say that the Bank was in support of this allocation. Since one of our key objectives&#13;
was to alleviate poverty, you know, we were anxious to direct more of our assistance to the more&#13;
backward states. But it was one thing to commit these resources in those states, identify and&#13;
prepare projects that could absorb these resources, and quite a different thing to implement these&#13;
projects and actually disburse those funds.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which state was the one that had communists running it?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, West Bengal has usually been ruled by the communists. The other state that&#13;
has always been communist is Kerala.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, where were they in the hierarchy of efficiency?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Kerala is a peculiar state. Kerala is one of the more advanced states. Kerala has a&#13;
very high literacy rate, approaching 100 percent. And this is due some enlightened maharajahs in&#13;
the 19th century, who recognized the value of education and attracted, in particular, Christian&#13;
missionaries to come and establish a well-functioning schooling and education system. In the&#13;
medical profession and among the nursing community, you find people from Kerala all over the&#13;
world, who are extremely efficient and who have sort ofbrought back to their home state,&#13;
prosperity and experience. But the peculiarity of the state is that somehow within the state-and&#13;
I cannot explain this, it is almost like a sort of chemical process-there is no ability to focus the&#13;
energies of these people in a productive fashion. People in Kerala engage in totally&#13;
nonproductive argumentation. At any given day you wake up in the morning in Kerala and there&#13;
is mayhem in the streets, protest marches of one kind or the other up the street and down the&#13;
street.&#13;
&#13;
I remember we were there once with the vice president, [Attila] Karaosmanoglu, and were in&#13;
some meeting with government officials. You could hear from far the protestors coming, with an&#13;
ever-increasing level of noise. Eventually, they came into the building, up the stairs, into the&#13;
room where we had our meeting, and were shouting and marching around, waving placards&#13;
condemning the World Bank, seemingly just for the heck of it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was there a particular grievance?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: They had some slogans, but it was just a hilarious. Attila and his wife, who was&#13;
there also, were a bit frightened, I think. But the protesters were laughing, and just had a good&#13;
time. They were not angry. They were just carrying on, waving these placards. Mrs.&#13;
Karaosmanoglu was actually hit on the head by accident by one of these placards, which caused&#13;
a bit of consternation.&#13;
&#13;
Now, this is an example of the daily preoccupation in Kerala, and nothing gets done as a result.&#13;
As a result, Kerala is economically one of the more backward states.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Even with a high level of literacy.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Even with the high level of literacy. But it is a wonderful state, and people, I think,&#13;
by and large are quite happy. All these people coming back are very faithful to Kerala. They&#13;
want to live in Kerala. They all build houses in Kerala. All these returnees have wonderful little&#13;
houses there among the palm trees. But when it comes to production, economic growth,&#13;
indigenous prosperity, Kerala is one ofthe-I would hate to say backward states, but it's clearly&#13;
not a successful state.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What role was the India Consortium playing at this time? You touched on this&#13;
somewhat, but maybe just focus on that a little bit. I'm talking about your first time in Delhi.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, the Consortium, as I have described, played a very active role in the 1960s. It&#13;
started in '58, when India faced an acute foreign exchange crisis, and then it played a fairly&#13;
significant role throughout the 1960s as the source of the foreign exchange resources that India&#13;
clearly needed to make it from one year to the other.&#13;
&#13;
This continued into the 1970s, but the pressure clearly was less at the time, largely because the&#13;
Indian agricultural economy had started to grow. The Green Revolution, which in large part had&#13;
been supported and pushed by the foreign donors, had taken hold and was resulting in ever-&#13;
increasing output of food. There was no further need for agricultural imports and, hence, some&#13;
considerable relief on the balance of payments side.&#13;
&#13;
One ofthe problems, of course, was still that exports tended to be very low, and the whole&#13;
system of regulations and controls did not encourage exports. Incidentally, Martin Wolf's&#13;
focus was, when he was working on India as a country economist, to analyze what happened to&#13;
exports and what needed to be done to step up exports.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You arrived in New Delhi at just about the time of Indira Gandhi's Declaration of&#13;
Emergency. What was the general atmosphere in New Delhi like at that time?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, it was terrible, but it was also remarkable. It was remarkable in one sense&#13;
because, as in [Benito] Mussolini's Italy and [Adolf] Hitler's Germany, many things improved as&#13;
a result of greater discipline. Specifically, trains and airplanes were running on time. But at the&#13;
same time, there was this spreading atmosphere of fear. Open criticism of the government&#13;
became dangerous. People were arrested and interrogated. Many of our friends in the&#13;
administration found themselves at receiving end of some of the wrath of the leadership. There&#13;
was this-the son of Mrs. Gandhi, who was a terrible figure.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was this Sanjay?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This was Sanjay, yeah. He was an unfortunate figure. He had been a playboy, never&#13;
really finished school properly, never learned anything. But he had a fairly strong influence on&#13;
his mother. Because of his proximity to his mother and because he had very simplistic visions of&#13;
how you could solve problems afflicting India like, for instance, population growth or the lack of&#13;
&#13;

education, he got involved in a whole variety of programs which turned out to be complete&#13;
fiascos. The key program was this forced sterilization program, where in a whole variety of ways&#13;
he was pushing the federal and the state administrations to promote the sterilization of men, in&#13;
particular. And this, while it may have had some momentary effect, really discredited the whole&#13;
family planning effort in the long run, and did a great deal of damage.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did you have much interaction with Mrs. Gandhi herself?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No, none at all. I mean, I met her a few times, usually in the company of visiting&#13;
Bank presidents, but personally I did not go and visit her. That was also discouraged by the&#13;
bureaucrats in India, who also, incidentally, discouraged contact with the ministers. I would also&#13;
say that in most cases the contacts with these ministers were not very productive because the&#13;
ministers would not normally go off on their own, and would strictly abide by the brief that was&#13;
given to them by their bureaucrats.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: By the senior civil servants? Sort of like "Yes, Minister," that comedy program&#13;
from England?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Exactly. After all, India followed the British model of parliamentary government.&#13;
Our contact was strictly with the administration, with the bureaucrats, and the occasions when&#13;
we did talk to the political leadership were largely restricted to ceremonial occasions.&#13;
&#13;
I remember there was one incident when Sir John Crawford-who, as I have mentioned earlier,&#13;
had been a member, a prominent member of the Bell Mission and author of the seminal&#13;
agricultural part of that report. He continued as a consultant to the Bank, and would come in&#13;
particular to India on regular visits. He would come like two or three times a year, and then have&#13;
a round of discussions with the various departments in the Ministry of Agriculture. He would&#13;
also go off and visit some of our projects. At one point-and I forget now what the particular&#13;
problem was that he was concerned about-he insisted on talking to the Minister of Agriculture.&#13;
The Minister of Agriculture at the time was Jagjivan Ram, an untouchable, a real politician.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Untouchable, in terms of his caste?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: In terms ofhis caste. A fellow who had been an early member of the Congress&#13;
Party and involved in the freedom-struggle and therefore a venerated figure in the system.&#13;
&#13;
Now, we had this meeting with him, and Crawford explained to him whatever the issues were,&#13;
and gently suggesting that he should take some action. He just sat there behind his desk,&#13;
scratching his belly. He was one of those guys who would always be clad in his dhoti. I was&#13;
wondering whether he even understood any of the things Crawford was saying. He was making&#13;
grunting noises but did not articulate any particular response. But the next day there was a fiery&#13;
article in the press lambasting the World Bank for its attempts to try to impose its views. In other&#13;
words, the intervention of Crawford on this occasion with this fellow was well understood, but&#13;
was obviously resented. The funny thing was that this did not come through at the meeting, that&#13;
the minister preferred to let us know what he thought through his newspapers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: There is a saying to the effect that the British introduced bureaucracy into India and&#13;
the Indians perfected it. Is that pretty much in accord with your observations?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I cannot judge the perfection or lack of perfection of the British bureaucracy,&#13;
but the Indian bureaucracy clearly was a piece of art. It was clearly unique. The whole system set&#13;
up well, but how efficiently it worked remains very much a question.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was that true during your whole involvement in India?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This was pretty much true throughout my whole involvement in India. When I&#13;
started, there was this sense of integrity that one associates with the British bureaucracy that was&#13;
very clearly present in India. In the British days this integrity was well-rewarded. The civil&#13;
servants were making very good salaries. They enjoyed a comfortable life and were able to send&#13;
their children to British schools to keep up the tradition.&#13;
&#13;
But the salaries continually eroded, and by the time I was involved with working with the&#13;
Indians, the salaries of the Indian civil servants were pretty puny. They were getting usually&#13;
fairly decent housing at nominal rents, but beyond that their salaries, especially expressed in&#13;
foreign exchange terms, were very low.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I remember there is one section in New Delhi where there are old British&#13;
bungalows, and they have been taken over by the senior civil servants and political figures.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. But those were the top civil servants, secretaries to the government and senior&#13;
ministers. The lower ranks had to live in apartments which by our standards would be considered&#13;
squalid, but were extremely valuable in a market with severe housing shortage. Beyond that, the&#13;
salaries were just pathetic. That is why for many Indian civil servants, foreign trips and foreign&#13;
assignments were sought after, and were being given as a reward for good performance.&#13;
&#13;
But, you know, notwithstanding these poor salaries, I have always been impressed how people&#13;
have remained completely honest and maintained their personal integrity, often in circumstances&#13;
where at the political level corruption was rife, and where civil servants found themselves&#13;
sometimes forced to endorse deals which they knew were not proper, but had been cooked up by&#13;
the minister that they were serving. I know of cases where civil servants just resigned because&#13;
they were not going to play along.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I don't know what conditions are today, but I have the sense that, as time went on,&#13;
corruption has become more widespread. Corruption works somewhat like capillary action; it&#13;
starts at the bottom and eventually soaks up the entire system. However, that was not true in my&#13;
days.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: During the Emergency, the Indian government implemented a 20-point economic&#13;
program designed to increase agricultural and industrial production, improve public services, and&#13;
fight poverty and illiteracy. This obviously touched on many things that the Bank was trying to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
do in India. How was this economic program viewed by you, as resident representative at the&#13;
time?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I don't remember this 20-point program. I remember there were particular&#13;
aspects that preoccupied us a good deal. One of the aspects I mentioned already was the&#13;
vasectomy program, the forced sterilization program. We were involved in the population sector;&#13;
we had a project going there, and we were concerned about the impact that these ad hoc ideas-&#13;
vasectomy at the railway stations and so on-would have on our program.&#13;
&#13;
I remember we had a staff member in our resident mission who throughout his career always had&#13;
a strong moral perspective that he brought to his work. He was outraged by the population&#13;
program instituted by the government at that time and suggested that in our economic reports we&#13;
should strongly criticize this approach. In the end we did not do that; we didn't want to rock the&#13;
boat.&#13;
&#13;
In the end, the Emergency lasted for, what, two and a half years or so.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What happened? After two-and-a-half years Mrs. Gandhi called an election.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: She called an election. I thought this was one her more remarkable moves.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: She thought she would win, and she actually lost&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I don't know whether she thought she would win. I thought she was herself&#13;
uncomfortable with the emergency. The democratic instincts that had been implanted in her by&#13;
her father, and her tradition and upbringing seemed to prevail when she made that decision.&#13;
&#13;
I thought it was not too difficult to predict that she wasn't going to do well if there was going to&#13;
be an election. The unhappiness with what was going on was pretty widespread. I remember&#13;
traveling about the country, you would meet people with their stories about the abuses of the&#13;
Emergency and how terrible this experience was. So I thought that it was in many ways&#13;
predictable that she was going to lose. She must have also sensed that it was an uphill battle. But&#13;
she did go forward with this election and lost; lost, you know, by a significant margin. There was&#13;
no argument about the outcome of the election.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: No "hanging chads," or anything like that.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No "hanging chads," no Supreme Court decisions, nothing of the sort. The origin of&#13;
this Emergency was some law case that she had. I forget what the issue was.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I think it was some electoral dispute.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Was it electoral? Or it may have also been some financial or taxation matter.&#13;
Anyway, she had one of the top lawyers, a fellow by the name of [Nani] Palkhivala. Now,&#13;
Palkhivala, who as the name shows was a Parsi, was one of the directors of the Tata Company. I&#13;
knew J.R.D. Tata and Palkhivala, and whenever I was in Bombay I would go and meet with Mr.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Tata, and then there would also be Mr. Palkhivala and a whole group of the other directors of&#13;
Tata Sons. Palkhivala was initially representing her in this case, but then she cut short the whole&#13;
proceedings and declared this Emergency, and suspended the whole thing. Palkhivala, of course,&#13;
became one of her more prominent critics and opponents. In part, as a result, when the new&#13;
government came in, he became ambassador here in Washington for a while.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In a letter to Ernest Stem, the World Bank vice president for South Asia, dated&#13;
November 5, 1976, you note among other things the good relationship that then existed between&#13;
India and the World Bank. You wrote: "The background to the good relationship between the&#13;
Bank and the government is McNamara's personal popularity, and the trust and confidence he&#13;
enjoys as someone who is seen to understand the problems of the developing countries and&#13;
determined to do something about their solution. This feeling is shared especially by the prime&#13;
minister"-who in this case was Indira Gandhi-"who is very personally concerned with the&#13;
polarization of the conflict between the industrialized and the developing countries." Did&#13;
MeN amara maintain this popularity in India to the end of his presidency in 1981?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: In some sense, yes. He was always considered a friend of India, a defender of&#13;
India's needs. But, of course, politically he may not have been as popular with the [Morarji R.]&#13;
Desai government as he was with Mrs. Gandhi.&#13;
&#13;
During my first tour in India he came twice. The first time he came when Mrs. Gandhi was there,&#13;
at the height of her Emergency administration, and they clearly got on extremely well. He was&#13;
given the royal treatment. That is to say, he was put up in Rashtrapati Bhavan, which is the&#13;
president's house in India, he was using the prime minister's plane&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I've seen the presidential palace. It's quite impressive from the outside.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Where President [George W.] Bush also would be staying when he goes there.&#13;
&#13;
Now, when he came again after Morarji Desai had taken over, he was received with a great deal&#13;
of warmth, especially on the part ofMorarji Desai. But, you know, at the same time he was&#13;
treated much more as an important but also ordinary visitor. So instead of Rashtrapati Bhavan,&#13;
he was given some big suite in one of the government's leading hotels there.&#13;
&#13;
I was trying to persuade him to have a press conference, and to use this press conference to&#13;
project our satisfaction with the political changes that had taken place, and how we felt that this&#13;
would all work for the poor and for the common objectives that we had with the government. But&#13;
he was extremely reluctant, and William [D.] Clark, who was his information guru, supported&#13;
him. So he did not meet with the press at that time because he was never very comfortable in&#13;
uncontrolled settings, and concerned that he might be dragged into commenting on political&#13;
developments in India. I guess it didn't matter all that much, but I think it would have been&#13;
helpful to us if he had kind of gone out there and pressed the flesh, and dealt with some of these&#13;
press people.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay. Jochen, the Green Revolution in agriculture in India could be said to span&#13;
roughly the period from 1967-68 to 1977-78. You were dealing with India during most ofthat&#13;
time, first from headquarters, with numerous visits to India, and then as resident representative in&#13;
New Delhi. What were some of the observations that you made concerning how the Green&#13;
Revolution changed Indian agriculture, and the Bank's role in it?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: That there was scope for significant yield improvements had already become clear at&#13;
the time when the Bell Mission went to India. The report of the Bell Mission dwelt on these&#13;
issues to some extent, and dwelt on the need to introduce and proliferate the use of the new high-&#13;
yielding seed varieties. This was true both for wheat, especially in Punjab and in northern India,&#13;
and also for rice.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I don't remember exactly when these respective breakthroughs were made. The Indians&#13;
recognized the potential of these improvements. The minister of agriculture at t~e time,&#13;
[Chidambaram] Subramaniam, and the secretary of agriculture, B. Sivaraman, were both&#13;
extremely bright, and also very positive and interactive with the Bell Mission. The question was&#13;
how the Bank could effectively help in this area. The importation of seeds was not a major item.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Hybrid seeds?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Hybrid seeds had to be imported, and you had to multiply the seeds by establishing&#13;
seed farms. But the investment potential in those areas was fairly limited. So what the Bank&#13;
focused on fairly early on was the fertilizer requirements, which were of course part of that&#13;
Green Revolution.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Very fertilizer-intensive, I believe.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Once you introduced these high-yielding varieties, you also needed to have fertilizer&#13;
to make the whole thing work. And the government, being always very limited in terms of the&#13;
foreign exchange they needed to import things, was very keen to establish in the country the&#13;
industry to produce the amounts of needed fertilizer.&#13;
&#13;
In accordance with the philosophy that was prevalent at the time, these fertilizer plants had to be&#13;
in the public sector, which of course was difficult for us to swallow. But then, as in so many&#13;
cases, we did eventually accept the notion that these plants would be in the public sector, and we&#13;
proceeded to make a whole series of loans for the construction of ever-larger fertilizer plants in&#13;
India.&#13;
&#13;
There was close contact between the Bank and the international research establishments,&#13;
formalized in the early '70s in the international group that the Bank formed at the suggestion of a&#13;
variety of the institutional donors. The donors that had initially supported the research, both in&#13;
Mexico and in the ~hilippines, were private foundations like the Ford Foundation and&#13;
Rockefeller Foundation.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 37&#13;

&#13;
By the early 1970s it had become clear that the needs of this research exceeded what they could&#13;
mobilize, and that you had to bring in other sources of funding. The Bank stepped into the&#13;
breach. And this was clearly one of the more brilliant achievements ofMcNamara, who formed&#13;
the international consultative group which undertook to fund all these international agricultural&#13;
research institutions.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You are talking about the Consultative Group on International Agricultural&#13;
Research.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes. C-G-1-A-R. There was also a growing number of new research institutions&#13;
created and supported by this consultative group. One ofthe early creations was ICRISAT&#13;
[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics], a dry land farming&#13;
international research station which was located in India, in Hyderabad. Through the contact&#13;
with the international research community and through the particular involvement with&#13;
ICRISAT, there was also a great deal of interaction with India on this whole question of the&#13;
Green Revolution and how it could be extended.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, the Green Revolution was not only tied to the supply of seeds and fertilizers, but also&#13;
irrigation. So the Bank's contribution to the spread of the Green Revolution was, on the one&#13;
hand, through the support of investment in fertilizer production facilities, but also increasingly&#13;
through the support of irrigation projects.&#13;
&#13;
One ofthe obstacles that got in the way oflarge and growing support of irrigation investment&#13;
was some disagreement with the Indian government over competitive bidding. The Bank, of&#13;
course, insisted that all the major contracts financed by Bank loans and IDA credits had to be&#13;
open to international competition. But the Indians resisted this.&#13;
&#13;
I think they had been instrumental earlier-! mean in the 1950s-to persuade the Bank to&#13;
introduce a preferential margin of 15 percent for domestic manufacturers bidding for Bank-&#13;
financed contracts. Now, in the late '60s they were raising questions about the bidding for civil&#13;
works contracts. This was ridiculous, and a figment of some of the paranoia that prevailed in&#13;
India about foreign involvement because it was inconceivable that foreign civil works&#13;
contractors would be interested in executing these relatively small contracts, and that they could&#13;
be successful in bidding for these contracts, especially if they would have to bring in their own&#13;
staff.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: They would be hopelessly noncompetitive.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This dispute went on for quite some time and effectively barred the Bank from&#13;
supporting major irrigation projects. When I became India Division chief in 1971, this was one&#13;
of the key headaches that was making it exceedingly difficult to commit the amounts money that&#13;
we had available for India. This, of course, concerned McNamara a great deal. It was eventually&#13;
through the efforts of Ernie Stem that a compromise was negotiated where we were giving&#13;
domestic contractors a preference margin of 7 ~ percent. But, as I said, I don't think this was&#13;
really needed or very meaningful, but it did remove the blockage to our lending program, and we&#13;
were able to provide assistance to irrigation projects.&#13;
&#13;

                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Mentioning Ernie Stem, just to go off on a tangent slightly, what was your&#13;
impression of him, and did that change over time, because you obviously interacted with him&#13;
when he was South Asia vice president, and then perhaps later, as he rose in the ranks?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, he made a swift career in the Bank. He had come into the Bank relatively late.&#13;
He had been with USAID, but as USAID was increasingly cutting back; a number of the AID&#13;
staffhad started to drift over to the Bank. He was one of the later arrivals in the Bank. But he&#13;
had been involved with the Bank before as the deputy head of the staff working for the former&#13;
Canadian prime minister Lester Pearson on the report of the Pearson Commission.&#13;
&#13;
Ifi remember correctly, he carne to the Bank in '72 or '73, and was initially in the economic&#13;
complex of the Bank, working with Hollis [B.] Chenery. While there he was increasingly used&#13;
by McNamara to deal with difficult problems and recognized for his skill and intelligence. Other&#13;
people recognized his talent as well, in particular Peter Cargill in our Region. So at the time&#13;
when Peter Cargill left to become vice president in charge of finance [Senior Vice President-&#13;
Finance], it was natural that Ernie Stem would come and succeed him as vice president in South&#13;
Asia. He spent two or three years in the South Asia Region, and when Burke Knapp retired, he&#13;
moved up to become Senior Vice President-Operations.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Going back briefly to the Green Revolution, did you ever meet Norman Borlaug,&#13;
who was considered the father of the Green Revolution?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. No, I didn't. He was, of course, the person who developed the high-yielding&#13;
wheat variety at the research station in Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In the publication India: The Challenge of Development, a Country Assistance&#13;
Evaluation published through the Operations Evaluation Department in 2001, the author, Gianni&#13;
Zanini, speaking of the late 1960s and 1970s, notes: "Indian authorities, who feared Bank&#13;
interference in politically sensitive national programs, resisted the Bank's ambitions to support&#13;
the government's antipoverty programs. Policy advice and economic analyses, mostly produced&#13;
by resident mission staff in close consultation with government officials, had a modest impact.&#13;
Conditionality was used sparingly, and common ground between the Bank's objectives and the&#13;
government's was usually stressed."&#13;
&#13;
Later, on page 12, referring to the strong commitment to structural adjustment by the new Indian&#13;
government in 1991, the author writes: "Changing the mind-set of the principal counterparts in&#13;
the core ministries was not an issue anymore." And on page 15 of the same study, the author&#13;
notes that: "Bank reports have been cautious in presenting conclusions and policy options&#13;
because of the government's sensitivity to criticism, its resistance to policy advice from external&#13;
sources, and its view that Indian experts and officials should be left to draw their own&#13;
conclusions on policy issues. As a result, the dissemination of controversial analyses and&#13;
recommendations has often been restricted, and many Bank reports have not been processed for&#13;
final distribution to the Board."&#13;
&#13;
Given the role of the resident mission cited in the first quotation above, and your involvement in&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
India from 1971 onward, it would be interesting to hear of your own experiences with the&#13;
undoubtedly complex interrelationship between Indian authorities and the Bank and how it&#13;
evolved. Now, you have certainly touched on this to a significant extent earlier in this interview,&#13;
but is there anything else you would like to add to that? The Indians seemed extraordinarily&#13;
touchy, especially early on in the relationship between the Bank and the Indian government.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: As I have said several times, the Indian administration were almost paranoid when it&#13;
carne to perceived outside interference. This was an attitude that was fairly widespread&#13;
throughout India. It also had to do with the fact that the political center of gravity in India always&#13;
tended to be fairly far to the left. Yet Indian political leaders, I think, recognized that they had to&#13;
follow more capitalist policies in the interest of efficiency, but were also at the same time feeling&#13;
extremely vulnerable to being criticized by the left, and were politically dependent on the&#13;
support of the left.&#13;
&#13;
If there was the slightest suspicion of any influence from the outside, whether it was the Bank or&#13;
any other donor, the left wing press would immediately pick up the issue and make a big deal out&#13;
of it. For some bureaucrat caught in the middle of this, this meant no end of extra work, ofbriefs&#13;
that had to be prepared for the ministers, endless meetings, clarifications and so on. So there&#13;
were good reasons to avoid this.&#13;
&#13;
Now, another issue--and I don't know whether this is part of this particular quotation-&#13;
somewhere I think you also mentioned Martin Wolf and his criticism of the Bank. This is the&#13;
question: to what extent the Bank was enforcing the conditions it had included in its lending&#13;
operations? I think one has to remember that while these conditions were negotiated as part of a&#13;
loan contract, they were always looked at as safeguards that the Bank might rely on in case of&#13;
dire problems. Surely the question remained whether or not to invoke these conditions and to&#13;
apply the pressure implicit in those conditions. In any contractual relationship that you have, this&#13;
remains a problem. It is clearly nonsense to say that the moment any of the conditions that are&#13;
part of your contract is infracted upon, you call off the whole deal.&#13;
&#13;
What do you do? You notice that the borrower is not applying certain steps that were meant to be&#13;
taken by some deadline. You write a letter and say, "Look, fellows, you haven't done this."&#13;
&#13;
And they come back and say, "Well, sorry, you know, but we haven't been able to do this&#13;
because we had some unforeseen problem."&#13;
&#13;
In other words, you get engaged in some lengthy dialogue. It is rare that you have a situation&#13;
where you have to conclude the borrower is obviously unwilling to live up to the spirit of the&#13;
agreement, and hence the only solution that we are left with is to terminate the whole deal. I have&#13;
dealt with the question of who influenced whom in a paper entitled "India and the World Bank,"&#13;
which I wrote in 1997 when I was in the history office.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That will be included in the file.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Jochen Kraske&#13;
                               March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The topic that I was trying to address in this paper was precisely this question of&#13;
whether the Bank had really been a factor in influencing Indian policies and Indian economic&#13;
behavior. Or vice versa, was it India that has been influencing the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
There is no doubt in my mind that, if anything, it was India that has been influencing the Bank.&#13;
The Indian influence on the Bank's behavior in many ways was probably greater than even the&#13;
influence of the U.S., who is the principal shareholder in the Bank and the leading initiator of the&#13;
Bank. It was by virtue of the fact that for many years India was far and away the most significant&#13;
client of the Bank, that it played a very influential role in shaping the Bank's policies. It was not&#13;
because of the shareholding of India in the Bank, but because of its role as the Bank's most&#13;
significant borrower. I should also mention here S. Guhan and M. R. Shroff, both at one point&#13;
Alternate Executive Directors on the Bank's Board, who became close personal friends and&#13;
whose ready and sincere advice was invaluable throughout my career in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Initially, in the 1950s, when India was not the largest borrower-Japan in those years was the&#13;
largest borrower from the Bank-India did still exercise a very significant influence because&#13;
India was considered to be a model of developing countries. It was the kind of country that&#13;
exemplified what needed to be accomplished. When you talked about development it was the&#13;
country which seemed to hold many of the answers that you were looking for in order to address&#13;
development problems. In particular, India was a country that had perfected the art of economic&#13;
planning.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, they picked that up from the Soviet Union, I imagine.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: They picked it up from the Soviet Union, but it is worth remembering that in those&#13;
days economic planning was regarded as essential, even in the United States, in the most&#13;
capitalist and conservative circles. It was taken as a given that economic planning was essential&#13;
if you wanted to make progress in economic development. The notion that you would just let the&#13;
market take over and determine the allocation of resources was regarded as heresy. So when&#13;
Martin Wolf now says, "Oh, the Bank was misguided when it insisted on economic planning and&#13;
endorsed the notion of economic planning," he ignores the state of the art at the time. The&#13;
consensus in the 1950s was that economic planning, and particularly of five-year variety, was the&#13;
key to addressing the problems of economic development, and that you had to have detailed and&#13;
specific targets if you wanted to have any chance of making progress.&#13;
&#13;
Now, speaking of India's influence, India was then both the country that seemed to have the&#13;
most obvious needs for development assistance--when you talk about dealing with poverty in&#13;
the world, India clearly was the country that presented the most striking poverty problem-but&#13;
also when you mentioned the need to transfer resources to the developing world, you could not&#13;
possibly conceive of a World Bank without lending to India.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara's program of doubling and tripling lending, of increasing IDA resources by multiples,&#13;
clearly could not be realized unless India was absorbing aid commitments consistent with these&#13;
targets. The Indians, of course, knew this quite well. There is no question that the Indians were&#13;
emboldened in many of their demands-whether it was insisting that the public sector should&#13;
play a key role, whether it was insisting that competitive bidding should be circumscribed when&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
it came to India, whether it was insisting that various other conditions would not be acceptable or&#13;
would not be enforced-by the Bank's need to stay involved and to maintain an active lending&#13;
relationship with India. This only started to change when other countries began to join the Bank,&#13;
in particular when China claimed its share of the Bank's resources.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The People's Republic, mainland China.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: When the People's Republic of China became an active member of the Bank, and&#13;
later the Soviet Union and its various satellites. While India is still a major player today, it is&#13;
clearly one among many borrowers. If India were to decide to drop out and not borrow from the&#13;
Bank, life would still go on.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who were some of the Indians, both in and out of government, with whom you&#13;
interacted, and what were your impressions of them? You have referred to some of them in our&#13;
discussion here, but were there any Indians who stand out in your memory?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: As I have mentioned, I have been blessed to be able to see India over a long period&#13;
of years, decades. So while my actual assignments might have been fairly limited from time to&#13;
time, I have been able to refer back and connect with earlier experience.&#13;
&#13;
One dimension ofthis involvement over time was my relationship with people, especially in the&#13;
government. I initially worked with government officials at relatively junior levels, and many of&#13;
them became close friends. They would rise through the ranks over the years, and I stayed in&#13;
touch. Eventually, they would become secretaries, heads of departments, chairmen oflarge&#13;
enterprises and institutions, governors of the central bank, and even ministers and influential&#13;
politicians, in the case ofManmohan Singh, even prime minister.                     Â·&#13;
&#13;
So, there are a large number of Indians who I consider friends, and who I regard with highest&#13;
respect. Among them, as I mentioned, Manmohan Singh, the prime minister now; I. G.&#13;
[Indraprasad Gordhanbhai] Patel, who died last summer, unfortunately, here on a visit in the&#13;
United States, who was a prominent economist and administrator; Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who&#13;
worked as a staff member here in the Bank at one point, and published books and articles&#13;
together with Hollis Chenery, and who is now the planning minister and right-hand advisor of&#13;
the prime minister in India; Bimal Jalan, who is the only person alive who has been both a staff&#13;
member of the IMF and the World Bank, and also a member of the boards of IMF and of the&#13;
Bank at various times, and who most recently was governor of the Reserve Bank and is now in&#13;
the upper house of parliament in India, and a close friend of mine.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How would you characterize your own relations with the Indian government over&#13;
time, especially during your time as resident representative?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I have always been able to get along well. I also have to say that, unlike some of my&#13;
colleagues, especially colleagues in the technical departments, who would become very&#13;
frustrated when dealing with Indian-their Indian counterparts because of the arguments and&#13;
difficulties they would put up, I have always enjoyed the Indian propensity to question things&#13;
that we would suggest, and to raise objections when they felt they were not understood.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Interestingly enough, I have been talking to Dennis [N.] de Tray, doing interviews&#13;
with him about Indonesia in particular, and I remember him saying something about technical&#13;
colleagues who would become frustrated dealing with the Indonesians and their culture. I don't&#13;
know if the reasons were quite the same, but it's interesting that technical people, it would&#13;
appear, sometimes have difficulty relating to other cultures.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Technical people by their nature presumably come with an understanding of a&#13;
particular technical problem and its solution, and don't necessarily see that the solution has to be&#13;
applied in the context of a variety of constraints.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, we've mentioned briefly Martin Wolf-and of course you had seen some of&#13;
the questions for these interviews. Martin Wolf, the current Associate Editor and Chief&#13;
Economics Commentator for the Financial Times, was employed as an economist for about ten&#13;
years at the World Bank. In a 2004 commentary on the web site The Globalist, entitled "Martin&#13;
Wolf versus the World Bank," June 25, 2004, he writes: "I worked on India as senior divisional&#13;
economist for three years in the 1970s. During that time my chief function, so far as the Bank&#13;
was concerned, was to justify the provision of significant quantities of aid, even though this&#13;
money was helping the government of India avoid desperately needed policy changes. As it&#13;
turned out, those changes were made in the midst of a deep foreign exchange crisis in 1991,&#13;
almost two wasted decades late."&#13;
&#13;
With regard to the 1980s, an Operations Evaluation Department report on India: The Challenges&#13;
of Development, a Country Assistance Evaluation which I touched on before, says: "In the 1980s&#13;
transfer of resources was the overriding objective of the Bank, with little concern for the&#13;
effectiveness with which the resources were used. As lending expanded in the wrong direction,&#13;
however, the quality at entry of the Bank portfolio faltered. OED [Operations Evaluation&#13;
Department] rated Bank performance at the project appraisal stage satisfactory in only 26 of 57&#13;
operations, 52 percent by commitment approved in fiscal 1985 through '89 ."&#13;
&#13;
Given your extensive experience in India, I would be interested to hear your response to these&#13;
observations.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Obviously, in hindsight we would all agree that things could have been handled&#13;
differently. I have always maintained that if India from the moment when she became&#13;
independent had followed sensible and effective economic policies, India would long have&#13;
equaled Japan in terms of wealth and influence, but this was not to be. And it was not to be&#13;
because Indian leaders had their own perspective.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were more socialistic.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This, incidentally, was the perspective that unfortunately had been inculcated by&#13;
educators in the United Kingdom.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You said that LSE [London School of Economics] is guilty of a lot of Third World&#13;
underdevelopment.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It's not a joke. It is a fact that Fabian socialism proved a disaster. It is also a&#13;
legitimate question whether unfettered economic growth, and policies in support of unrestrained&#13;
economic grovvth without very active concern and intervention in support of distribution, could&#13;
have really worked very smoothly. So people like Gandhi and Nehru clearly were very&#13;
concerned with the potential for social tensions in India.&#13;
&#13;
But in retrospect, it is clear that India could have done much better than she actually did. It is&#13;
also a fact that in 1991 the acute foreign exchange crisis, which then forced the government to&#13;
change policies, did have very salutary effects on the economy. However, without the dire&#13;
emergency of impending bankruptcy, it would not have been politically feasible to take these&#13;
decisions.&#13;
&#13;
The question then is whether the Bank, by withholding its support and persuading, incidentally,&#13;
other donors to do likewise, should have forced India into this near bankrupt situation earlier.&#13;
This is clearly nonsense. It is inconceivable that the Bank would have done this, nor would this&#13;
have been tolerated in conditions of the Cold War, which was still pitting the United States&#13;
against the Soviet Union. Although India increasingly tended to lean towards the Soviet Union,&#13;
but if the Indians had felt that they had been totally written offby the Western countries, this&#13;
would have severely impacted on the global balance that was maintained at that time.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So for many reasons, cutting off aid or severely curtailing aid was just a non-starter.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It was just not on. Was there hypocrisy on the part of the Bank? I suppose there was,&#13;
but I have to admit that I didn't lose any sleep about the fact that we were lending money that&#13;
was not as effectively absorbed as it might have been.&#13;
&#13;
There is also the other question, that throughout the developing world there were poor&#13;
performers and there were good performers. India was somewhere in the middle, and if anything&#13;
closer to the better performers than to the poorest performers. Once you look at the global issue&#13;
of development, you have to look at things in this perspective. Are you going to cut off some of&#13;
your members on performance grounds? So you tend to be inclined to tolerate ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Sub-optimal performance.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: .. sub-optimal performance. So, while I appreciate what Martin Wolf has to say&#13;
now, I don't think that this is very relevant to what happened at that time.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Do you remember him from your time at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Oh, sure, I remember him very welL He became the economist in the division when&#13;
I was the division chief. We have had great economists in the India Division. Initially when I&#13;
became the India Division chief, we had a wonderful economist, Robert [H.] Cassen. I don't&#13;
know whether you remember him. He became a well known figure in Oxford where he became&#13;
the head of Queen Elizabeth House.&#13;

Another fellow who worked on India, but not in the India Division, rather in the field office&#13;
when I first started as the division chief was Tim [Timothy P.] Lankester, who, of course, later&#13;
came back to the Bank as Executive Director and then became secretary of education in the UK.&#13;

&#13;
ZIEGLER: You returned to headquarters in 1979 to be a department director in the East Africa&#13;
Region. However, you returned to New Delhi as chief of mission again in 1987. What induced&#13;
you to return?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, the answer to that is fairly easy. We had a major reorganization in 1987 in the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: It could be called a disorganization.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Or a disorganization. I was shafted when they had this wonderful children's game as&#13;
part of the reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, yes, musical chairs.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Musical chairs. I failed to find my proper seat when the music stopped, and so I had&#13;
to look for another opportunity. I was very happy to find that the India position was opening up.&#13;
The head of the India Department [Asia Country Department IV] was a close friend of mine,&#13;
Bilsel Alisbah, who was very happy to send me back to India.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So you weren't unhappy about going back.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I wasn't unhappy about going back at all. I had the fondest memories of India. And&#13;
as I said, throughout my Bank career and until now I have kept in touch with India and followed&#13;
developments there. So I was happy to go back to India and to renew my acquaintances. Of&#13;
course, circumstances had changed in many ways.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I was going to ask you, what were the most significant changes in continuities that&#13;
you saw, going back?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, on the personal side, of course, you know I had become older, and where on&#13;
my first tour in India, I had been sort of primus inter pares among colleagues of my generation,&#13;
all with small children who went to school in India, during my second innings, I was clearly an&#13;
older person dealing with people who were generally younger than I was. Our children had half&#13;
grown up. They were in college at the time when we went back, and were not with us while we&#13;
lived in India.&#13;
&#13;
As I said, many of the people that I knew in the government had risen to positions of greater&#13;
prominence, which in many ways made life easier. I had much more ready access to the&#13;
decision-making level.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jochen Kraske&#13;
                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, at the same time, technology had also evolved, and where during my first four years in&#13;
India I was pretty much left to myself-I still remember during the entire four years, I made only&#13;
one telephone call to Washington, and that was at the time when I had to discuss my&#13;
reassignment back to headquarters at the end of that tour. Otherwise, contact with Washington&#13;
relied exclusively on the exchange of telexes. One had developed a great skill in boiling things&#13;
down into telex form, both in terms of volume and also in terms of content that would hide&#13;
delicate and confidential issues.&#13;
&#13;
There was a code book which had been developed at the time of the Bell Mission. But this code&#13;
book was pretty silly, and furthermore I think you could be sure that the Indian equivalent of the&#13;
NSA [U.S. National Security Agency] would have copies of that code book, and would decipher&#13;
anything you were sending in code to Washington. So it became an art to write telexes in a way&#13;
that was conveying messages without necessarily spelling them out clearly for outsiders to read&#13;
and understand.&#13;
&#13;
Now, when I came back for my second tour, this had changed completely. In fact, one of the first&#13;
steps that I took was to negotiate with Washington and with the Indian telephone authorities the&#13;
installation of a dedicated telephone line that would link the resident mission to headquarters in&#13;
Washington. So I had moved from a situation where you were quite detached for all practical&#13;
purposes to a situation where you were in close touch with headquarters, and where you would&#13;
usually have several phone calls every day.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: A big time difference, though. Is it about 12 hours?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The time difference is, depending on whether you have daylight saving time or&#13;
standard time, it was either 10-and-a-half or 9-and-a-halfhours. But it effectively meant that you&#13;
would have to call in the evening to reach people here in the morning and vice versa. But still&#13;
you would use the telephone, and that changed the whole character ofyour existence. You were&#13;
much more closely tied into what was happening at headquarters.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Good, bad, or mixed?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It was a totally different feeling. Before, you had the feeling that you were out adrift&#13;
at sea somewhere, and had to rely on your own wits to survive and to manage. Of course, you&#13;
would get messages, and they would kind of keep you on some course, but there was not the&#13;
sense of being immediately tied into the decision-making process back home. Now you were&#13;
essentially an extension of the system here in Washington, and that, in some way, made life in&#13;
the resident mission less exciting.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, in the meantime changes have continued to the point where the actual center of&#13;
decision-making has been shifted to the field by putting the head of the resident mission in&#13;
charge of the country department.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The head of the resident mission became country director.&#13;
&#13;

                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: There were some particular initiatives which I remember. At the-in fact, at the&#13;
Annual Meeting prior to my assignment to New Delhi, the vice president, Attila Karaosmanoglu&#13;
at that time, met with the Indian delegation. There was criticism of the Indians because of the&#13;
slow rate of disbursements and the large amounts of undisbursed balances that had been building&#13;
up. But the Indian delegation came back and said, "Look, this is largely because your procedures&#13;
and conditions are just impossible to live with."&#13;
&#13;
So one of my first tasks when I returned to Delhi was to initiate a study of disbursement&#13;
procedures and disbursement conditions. For this purpose I hired two prominent Indian friends&#13;
and former senior government officials to conduct the study. They produced a report, and I&#13;
suppose there were a number of improvements introduced as a result of these findings.&#13;
&#13;
The second new initiative had to do with the relations with NGOs [non-governmental&#13;
organizations]. At that time, [Barber B.] Conable had become the president of the Bank. The&#13;
influence ofNGOs in the whole development dialogue had increased very significantly. Conable&#13;
was making an effort to accommodate the perspective of these NGOs wherever that was possible&#13;
and, in the first instance, to seek out the views that they had to offer.&#13;
&#13;
This was true especially in environmental matters. There were a number of cases that were very&#13;
prominent. There was the Polonoroeste project in Brazil, which had become a major&#13;
embarrassment, and in India there was the Sardar Sarovar project, an irrigation project on the&#13;
only west-flowing river in India, in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat.&#13;
&#13;
So I took the initiative to meet with the NGOs in India. We had regular get-togethers in the&#13;
office.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were these Indian NGOs?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: These were Indian NGOs. They represented a spectrum of the many hundreds of&#13;
Indian NGOs. I don't know how useful this was.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: For you or for them?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: There was a misunderstanding about the purpose of these meetings. Of course, I&#13;
talked to the people in the Department of Economic Affairs and told them, "Look here, I think&#13;
this is something that we ought to do. Everybody is talking about the NGOs and how we should&#13;
ascertain their views and keep in touch with them. Would you have any problem ifl were to&#13;
invite these people and discuss our lending program and the problems that we encounter in&#13;
implementing our projects with these people?"&#13;
&#13;
And my counterpart, Jagmohan Bajaj smiled, "Oh, by all means, you go ahead, be my guest. But&#13;
I can also tell you that this is going to be a highly frustrating exercise, and don't expect that&#13;
much is going to come of it." And in a sense I suppose that was true.&#13;
&#13;
The principal representatives of the NGOs approached these meetings and the contact with us&#13;
with the expectation that we would help them solve their problems with the government. Of&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jochen Kraske&#13;
                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006 Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
course, I had to make clear to them that that was neither possible nor really on our agenda. We&#13;
had a program with the government to implement a variety of projects, and we were keen to find&#13;
out what people thought of these projects, and how they thought it affected them, and what&#13;
needed to be done to improve the effectiveness of these projects. So while we had these&#13;
meetings, and while these meetings were usually pretty vocal and nois.y-there were large&#13;
crowds of people in various forms of dress and undress who were getting together-the outcome&#13;
of these meetings was pretty uninteresting.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You mentioned the Sardar Sarovar project on the Narmada-River. You were there&#13;
for part of the time when it was underway. Anything you care to say about that? As you well&#13;
know, it became very controversial. There was a big investigation initiated by Lewis [T.]&#13;
Preston, the president of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. It led to the introduction of the Inspection Panel, which has since become a&#13;
part of the organizational infrastructure of the Bank. This was the first project that the Inspection&#13;
Panel investigated and presented a report on to the Bank. But eventually the whole thing fizzled&#13;
out because the Indian government said, "Thank you very much. We want you to cancel this loan&#13;
and get out of this project."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: But they continued building the project.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I don't know what happened. I understand that the project is now completed,&#13;
but after long and costly delays. I think this was a great tragedy, and the environmental and other&#13;
concerns that were raised in criticism of this project were totally overblown, and also not very&#13;
relevant.&#13;
&#13;
This was a project whose history goes back way into the early days oflndia's independent&#13;
history. The project was inaugurated by Prime Minister Nehru, but stalled because of disputes&#13;
about the allocation ofthe waters ofthe Narmada River between the various riparian states,&#13;
Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. There were years and years of litigation, and it was&#13;
only in '79, just about the time when I left after my first tour in India, that the highest courts in&#13;
India had finally given an award and decided how these waters would be allocated among the&#13;
states, and therefore cleared the way for investments on this river to go forward.&#13;
&#13;
I remember when we went to Gujarat with McNamara on his last official visit to India, we&#13;
looked at this project. The chief minister at the time was making a presentation and saying, you&#13;
know, how important this project would be to the state of Gujarat.&#13;
&#13;
The project went forward, and the Bank supported it. And I should say, while it is quite common&#13;
to have controversies about projects among the different political parties, there was total&#13;
unanimity in the political arena about the importance ofthis project and the priority that should&#13;
be given to this project. In fact, it would have been political suicide for any member of the state&#13;
assembly to oppose this project.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So all the parties were united in favor of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It was then that these environmental activists started to raise all sorts of issues, and&#13;
to take their complaints to the international scene. The main Indian activist even testified before&#13;
Congress here in the United States. In other words, since the normal political process would not&#13;
respond to their complaints, they tried to put pressure on the Bank and on the government of&#13;
Japan-the other outside donor-through the network of international NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
They would paint a picture of a pristine natural environment that was being violated by the&#13;
construction of this darn. You were led to believe that there were tigers and happy indigenous&#13;
natives walking around undisturbed, whereas the area that was being flooded by the reservoir of&#13;
the dam was for all intents and purposes a wasteland. The trees had been chopped down a long&#13;
time ago by the poor tribal people who were living there and needed firewood.&#13;
&#13;
But the momentum kept building up, and eventually the whole project came to a grinding halt.&#13;
The outcome was the worst that you could possibly have, namely large amounts of money sunk&#13;
into this project and benefits limited and long delayed.&#13;
&#13;
The generators were supposed to be supplied by Japan. Of course, the Japanese came under&#13;
terrific pressure by their own group, the Friends of the Earth. So the Japanese refused to supply&#13;
the generators, even when the Indians said, "Never mind aid; we are going to pay cash for these&#13;
things." I don't know what kind of generators they were eventually able to install.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So is it fair to say that your conclusion would be that the NGOs were unsuccessful?&#13;
In other words, the project was built anyway, but not in the best possible way?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. The NGOs were also hurting the interest of the people whom they claimed to&#13;
represent, the people dislocated by the project. The Bank, under pressure from its environmental&#13;
critics, had insisted on fairly generous assistance for all those that needed to be resettled. When&#13;
the government decided to work without the Bank, those benefits were lost, and the people&#13;
negatively affected by the project received the standard compensation, if anything at all.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So the intervention by the NGOs was counterproductive?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes, I think it was totally counterproductive. The principal activist, Medha Patkar,&#13;
went on to reject the whole notion of economic development in favor of preserving some natural&#13;
state, totally ignoring that every year brings a net increase in the Indian population in the order of&#13;
20 million, who have to live somewhere and be fed. And the major international NGOs, focusing&#13;
on projects which allowed them to project themselves effectively, their motives had to do more&#13;
with their political role, their interest in establishing themselves as a major player, than with the&#13;
subjects whose interests they claimed to represent.&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, this was true with so many of these NGOs interventions. In Nepal I became&#13;
marginally involved in a similarly controversial project, the Arun project. This was a run-of-the-&#13;
river project which was supposed to be built up in the mountains. And, again, it became a major&#13;
problem, and eventually the Bank dropped out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I suppose by now much of the steam that was fueling this activism has dissipated. I don't think&#13;
nowadays this is as much a problem as it was at the time. In part, of course, it is also because&#13;
institutions like the World Bank are abiding by very strict standards when it comes to&#13;
environment and resettlement of people, and are less vulnerable to criticism. But in part it is also&#13;
simply because institutions like the Bank stay away from projects. One of the most&#13;
environmentally significant interventions in the world, the Three Gorges project in China, is&#13;
proceeding without the Bank's involvement, and therefore without any outside input on the&#13;
design and implementation of this gigantic project&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Chinese do whatever way they want&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The Chinese will do what they want, and nobody will have an opportunity to tell&#13;
them how they could do what they are doing better, and with less damaging effects.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: India entered the 1990s with a substantial record of achievement. Famine had been&#13;
eradicated and food self-sufficiency achieved. Social indicators had improved, with a rise in life&#13;
expectancy, a reduction in infant mortality, a moderated population growth rate, and increased&#13;
primary school enrollment However, a grave financial crisis put all in jeopardy. The finance&#13;
minister at the time, and now Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, summed up the crisis thus:&#13;
"India had an unsustainable fiscal deficit Our central government fiscal deficit was as high as&#13;
8.5 percent ofGDP. India had an unsustainable balance of payments deficit. The current account&#13;
deficit was close to 3.5 percent of GDP, and there were no foreign leaders who were willing to&#13;
finance that deficit. Our foreign exchange reserves had literally disappeared, so we were on the&#13;
verge of bankruptcy, and the nation faced an acute collapse of its economy."&#13;
&#13;
Were you and others in the Bank able to anticipate this financial crisis, or did it come as&#13;
something of a surprise? Now, this would have been toward the end of your second period in&#13;
New Delhi.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No, it did not come as a surprise, and it didn't happen overnight To some extent, it&#13;
was also disguised by the fluidity of political conditions in India at the time.&#13;
&#13;
There were different governments that came and fell. And because of the lack of political&#13;
stability it was impossible to introduce the discipline that was needed to bring the situation under&#13;
control, the fiscal problem in particular, which was the root cause of the deterioration. So, in that&#13;
sense, it was clearly necessary to hit the wall, in order to overcome the political lethargy and&#13;
indecision, and confront the fundamental economic problems.&#13;
&#13;
I forget now the exact sequence of events. It was the Congress Party that had come back into&#13;
power, with [Pamulaparti Venkata] Narasimha Rao, as the prime minister. He was not a very&#13;
distinct charismatic leader, but one of the babujis who had risen through the ranks. Confronted&#13;
with the acute economic crisis, he decided that he needed to have a finance minister who really&#13;
knew what needed to be done, rather than some political crony who had to be accommodated in&#13;
the cabinet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The first person he turned to was I. G. Patel, who was living in retirement in Baroda, and I. G.&#13;
Patel said no. He wasn't in good health and didn't have the stamina to take on the burden of this&#13;
task. So the next person Narasimha Rao turned to was Manmohan Singh, and he took the job.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What was Singh doing at the time? Do you remember?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He was at the time in semi-retirement. He was the head of the university grants&#13;
commission, which is an honorific position which provides you with an office, reflecting his&#13;
distinguished career and his experience.&#13;
&#13;
So he was put in the Ministry of Finance, and made it very clear to the people who appointed&#13;
him and to the rest of the cabinet that unless everybody was willing to support the efforts needed&#13;
to confront this situation, he wasn't going to waste his time with reforms. The parameters of the&#13;
reform program, and the politically difficult deCisions that it entailed, were quite clear to&#13;
everybody. Miraculously, everybody stuck with it, and it produced results virtually overnight.&#13;
The Bank came in. The IMF also at that point came in with a program.&#13;
&#13;
When I left there was a campaign underway for national elections. The front-runner was Rajiv&#13;
Gandhi. He was expected to win this election again and come back as prime minister. But during&#13;
the campaign he was assassinated, at the end of May or early in June 1991.&#13;

ZIEGLER: Today is March 20th, 2006. My name is Charles Ziegler, a consultant with the&#13;
World Bank Group Oral History Program. I'm at the home of Mr. Jochen Kraske in Bethesda,&#13;
Maryland, to conduct the third session of his oral history interview.&#13;
&#13;
Well, Jochen, when we left offlast time, we were talking about India, and we didn't quite finish,&#13;
so we'll take up with that today. It has been said that India has had a major influence on the&#13;
Bank's understanding of development. Given your extensive experience in and with India, it&#13;
would be interesting to hear what you believe those major influences have been.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: India in the 1950s was considered the key example ofhow economic development&#13;
needed to be understood and addressed. India was facing enormous problems. From the moment&#13;
India became independent, the political leadership of India was fully seized with the importance&#13;
of economic development, and focused on economic development. And the institutional&#13;
framework of India was well-geared to address problems throughout the various levels of the&#13;
economy.&#13;
&#13;
The notion at the time was to address economic development in the context of a development&#13;
plan. This, incidentally, was accepted throughout. It was not just because Mr. Nehru had been&#13;
influenced by the London School of Economics in his approach to economic thinking. It was not&#13;
because he was an early visitor and admirer of the Soviet Union and its approach to economic&#13;
development. There was a general belief that economic planning was a sine qua non to economic&#13;
development. So the Bank in its early missions was preaching the need for development&#13;
planning. The much touted economic survey missions, which the Bank organized in a number of&#13;
countries at their request-usually after they had joined the Bank-were designed to help these&#13;
countries to develop economic plans.&#13;
&#13;
So India, in a way, was ahead of the curve, had successful economic plans, and was studied not&#13;
just by the economists in the Bank but by development economists throughout the world as the&#13;
key example ofhow economic development should be approached. In that sense, India, from the&#13;
start, had a very strong influence on how the Bank approached economic development.&#13;
&#13;
As time went on, the priorities of economic development were also demonstrated by India.&#13;
Initially, it was the development of infrastructure and manufacturing industry which was the&#13;
focus of economic development in India.&#13;
&#13;
By the end of the 1950s, it became clear that agriculture had been neglected and needed to be&#13;
addressed. There were food shortages. Everybody was impressed with the colossal needs of food&#13;
required to keep the growing Indian population alive. So agriculture became a priority.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Next thing the population problem and, again, India was among the first countries that had an&#13;
active population program. Education was an area that India focused on very early. The need to&#13;
consider the distribution of income as a factor of effective economic growth was recognized&#13;
early in India.&#13;
&#13;
So India was always at the leading edge when it came to the perception of priorities in economic&#13;
development, and the Bank was eager to tap into the experience of India. There was also, of&#13;
course, a steady flow of Indian staff, of brilliant economists and administrators who would come&#13;
and join the Bank, and help shape the Bank's analyses.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You consider them to have been of high quality?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Very high-either at the level of the Executive Board of the Bank or on the staff of&#13;
the Bank and the Fund. One of the remarkable features was that these brilliant and well-educated&#13;
and experienced people would not just come to settle in the United States and have a comfortable&#13;
life and bring their children up in an environment of good education. They were people who&#13;
were very dedicated to India. After having made their contribution here, they would return to&#13;
India and resume positions of responsibility in the administration, or in some of the leading&#13;
institutions in India.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Would this Bank experience have been considered a plus in their careers? Are you&#13;
aware of whether that is the case or not?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I would think it was generally a plus. It was also for them an opportunity to interact&#13;
with economists from other countries, and to build up their own expertise.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who were the Bank staff, both in the resident mission and at headquarters, who&#13;
made the greatest impression on you during your involvement with India?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The people I worked with very closely at the beginning were the members of the&#13;
Bell Mission. There was Bernie Bell himself, and I came to know him fairly well because we&#13;
spent 7 to 8 months together in the same hotel in New Delhi in '64-'65. The members of the Bell&#13;
Mission, all fairly senior economists in the Bank: Stanley Please, Kenneth Bohr, Jean Baneth,&#13;
David Holland. There were the agricultural people like Sir John Crawford, whom I came to&#13;
know fairly well and worked with closely later on; WolfLadejinsky, an eminent land reform&#13;
specialist; David Hopper, who later became vice president in the Bank. India was always a&#13;
country that attracted great talents in the Bank. The res rep in India at the time of the Bell&#13;
Mission was Ben King, an old friend of mine to this day, and someone I have been in touch with&#13;
throughout the last 45 years. There was Gilmartin.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: William Gilmartin.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: William Gilmartin, who was a wonderful economist, and brilliant in his&#13;
understanding, and the way he could communicate his understanding of the economy. Peter&#13;
Cargill, who was the head of the department for many years. These were all people whom I came&#13;
to know fairly closely, and who obviously had a very strong influence on my own development.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: During the latter part of your second tour in New Delhi, plans were going forward&#13;
for a new building for the resident mission. What role did you play in the planning ofthis&#13;
structure?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: As resident representative, one of my responsibilities was to look after not only the&#13;
accommodation for the office but also of the staff that was transferred to the resident mission&#13;
from Washington. This was a real headache, and a headache that grew as time went on, as New&#13;
Delhi started to grow, and the international community in Delhi started to expand, and the&#13;
competition for available space became more fierce. It was agonizing to see how, as time went&#13;
on, we had to pay outrageous amounts of rent. So it had been obvious for some time to think in&#13;
terms of acquiring some buildings in New Delhi in order to save some money for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Now, it was curious to see that McNamara had been dead set against any suggestion that the&#13;
Bank should acquire real estate. He somehow thought that it was unethical for the Bank to be&#13;
seen to profit in the real estate market while supposedly there to help fight poverty. So he did not&#13;
want to hear that we should have our own office building.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You had been renting accommodations all along?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: When the resident mission was opened in New Delhi in '58, the government&#13;
provided office accommodation in the Reserve Bank building. But when the mission expanded in&#13;
the mid-1960s in the wake ofthe Bell Mission, the body of the mission grew larger, and the&#13;
government also was not necessarily in sync with the objectives of the mission any longer. The&#13;
Bank had to find its own accommodation, and we had to start renting space. We had rented first&#13;
some villa on Sadar Patel Road, and later there was some institutional building next to the Lodhi&#13;
Gardens which we rented.&#13;
&#13;
At the time when I arrived in New Delhi as res rep, we had found very nice accommodations in&#13;
the building constructed by the Ford Foundation. The Ford Foundation had been very prominent&#13;
in India, under the leadership of a fellow from Missouri, Douglas Ensminger, who had&#13;
introduced the concept of community development. He had a very close personal relationship&#13;
with Nehru, and had been there for many years. He had become an institution himself. I think he&#13;
had his own airplane. He had a horse-drawn carriage that he used to go back and forth to his&#13;
office. And he had persuaded the government to give him some land to build/construct an office&#13;
building which was very attractive, and designed by a leading architect5 Joseph Stein, an&#13;
American who had settled in New Delhi.&#13;
&#13;
When I came as res rep to New Delhi, the Ford Foundation and the United States had fallen out&#13;
of favor, and the Ford Foundation itself considered the opulence of the building as a drawback.&#13;
They were eagerly looking for somebody to take the building off their hands and was able to pay&#13;
for the upkeep of the building and the grounds. So there was an agreement that the building&#13;
would officially be handed over to the United Nations, but the UNDP, which had a large staff&#13;
and had to be accommodated by the government, didn't have much money. So the UNDP then&#13;
agreed to give half of that building to the Bank, in exchange for the Bank taking care of much of&#13;
the maintenance and the running of this building.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But the office staff grew. Soon, we had to rent other buildings to accommodate additional staff.&#13;
There was also increasing pressure from the United Nations to get hold of the extra space. The&#13;
idea of the Bank acquiring its own office building became a subject that was being discussed&#13;
with the government.&#13;
&#13;
In close proximity to the building of the Ford Foundation, the government was planning to&#13;
develop a whole block to accommodate a variety of institutions-religious institutions, cultural&#13;
institutions, governmental institutions, para-governmental institutions-Alliance Francaise,&#13;
UNESCO [United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization], UNICEF [United&#13;
Nations Children's Fund], the Islamic Center. The Bank, among these others, was allocated a&#13;
part of that piece.&#13;
&#13;
When I came back in 1987, these discussions had been going on and were continuing. Once&#13;
every two months or so I would go to some meeting in the Ministry of Housing where the&#13;
development of this whole complex was being discussed. In these discussions the various&#13;
participants in the scheme looked to the World Bank as the big spender who would not only take&#13;
care of its own needs but might also be pressurized into taking care of some of the common&#13;
facilities; there was talk of a plaza and a parking house. At one point, I remember, the Alliance&#13;
Francaise decided that they were no longer interested in their allocation. I was actually quite&#13;
eager to get that extra space. But the price for getting this allocation was that we would have to&#13;
take care of some ofthe common facilities, and this was turned down in Washington. Anyway,&#13;
by the time my second tour was reaching its end, things had jelled. We had been given formal&#13;
possession of a piece of land and, mind you, this was leased land. We were starting to look for an&#13;
architect to design the building.&#13;
&#13;
I was fairly involved in the effort to identify an Indian architect. We were successful in finding a&#13;
very attractive fellow, who came up with a beautiful design. Two or three months before my&#13;
departure, I presided over a groundbreaking ceremony, where a Hindu priest performed the&#13;
relevant rituals, blessing the ground, and shoveling some dirt around.      Â·&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You left before the building went up?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It was my successor, Oktay Yenal, who spent a great deal of his time seeing to the&#13;
construction and the proper decoration of this building. It turned out to be an attractive and nice&#13;
building, which in the meantime, unfortunately, again suffers because of overcrowding. The&#13;
resident mission has since expanded yet again, and there is now a multitude of different buildings&#13;
occupied by the resident mission.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I would agree with your assessment of the building. I was there for a couple days in&#13;
1997, and I was very favorably impressed by it. I thought it was a really beautiful structure, very&#13;
in keeping with the locale.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. It was one of the key considerations, to fmd an architect and a design that was&#13;
fitting into the local Mughal environment of the Lodhi Gardens, which are just in the back of that&#13;
building.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I should add for the record here that you wrote for Oktay Yenal in 1993, I believe it&#13;
was, a history of the resident mission in New Delhi, which I'm going to add to the file that will&#13;
accompany your interview. Along with it will be the paper you wrote in 1997 on the history of&#13;
the Bank's involvement with India. 1&#13;
&#13;
What were the issues in the planning and the construction of the new building? Yau talked about&#13;
going to meetings, but what were some of the major issues that came up?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: One of the problems was that the Housing Ministry, which owned and administered&#13;
this block of land, was trying to ensure that the whole scheme would come up in a sensible and&#13;
well-coordinated fashion. The problem they were facing was that there were many tenants who,&#13;
while very deserving, didn't really have the money to put up their building. I think when last I&#13;
visited there-about a year ago-there were still some buildings that had not been completed.&#13;
&#13;
But by and large demand for this kind of space had increased all the time, and as much as it did,&#13;
institutions were also able to mobilize the funds to construct whatever they wanted to construct.&#13;
The other issue that caused me at least some concern was the lease that the government was&#13;
offering at the time. I think it was something short of 20 years. The rent that we had to pay for&#13;
the land was nominal, but the investment in the building was quite substantial, around $6 million.&#13;
This amount of money had to be amortized over the rather short period of the lease because at&#13;
the end of the lease, the land and the building would revert to the government.&#13;
&#13;
I tried to negotiate some clause that at the end of this lease it would be understood that the Bank&#13;
would have some right to continue this lease. I think that was eventually agreed. The people in&#13;
the government felt that they had to insist on these terms because they had been adopted&#13;
generally by the government in deals with outsiders. The relationship with the Bank was&#13;
considered to be an ongoing relationship, as would be the lease of the land for the building.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, India clearly was an important part of your career, and you have an obvious&#13;
affection for the country and its people. Do you have any final comments to make about your&#13;
experience in India before we move on?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No, only to say that my work with the India program has clearly shaped my&#13;
understanding of economic development, my understanding of what needs to be done, and how it&#13;
can be done. And that has, to some extent, also carried forward into other assignments, in&#13;
particular the assignment that I took after I left my first resident assignment in India, when I&#13;
returned to headquarters and became the head of one of the East African programs departments.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's where we're moving to right now, because between stints in New Delhi,&#13;
from mid-1979 to mid-1987, you were director of the Country Programs Department I in the&#13;
Eastern African Region, with responsibilities for a considerable number of East African&#13;
countries. What occasioned this assignment?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I had spent four years in the resident mission.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In New Delhi.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: In New Delhi. In the early days of the Bank, resident assignments were usually for&#13;
two-year periods. As time went on, there was a tendency to extend these assignments, initially to&#13;
three years and eventually to four years. But four years was really considered to be the limit. So&#13;
it was clear in 1979 that I needed to be reassigned back to headquarters. I suppose there was&#13;
some concern that people, if they stayed too long in resident missions, would "go native" and&#13;
lose the detachment essential for your proper performance.&#13;
&#13;
What happened was that one of my colleagues, an early friend in the Bank and very good&#13;
economist who had become the head of the department dealing with India, Manfred [G.] Blobel,&#13;
all of a sudden died of a heart attack at the very young age of 47 or 48. So there was a revirement&#13;
of department heads at headquarters. One of these positions opened up. So I returned to&#13;
Washington and took over the Eastern Africa programs department, which dealt with all ofthe&#13;
Anglophone countries in East Africa, extending from Kenya in the north to Botswana, Lesotho&#13;
and Swaziland in south Africa. The department at that point did not yet include Zimbabwe or&#13;
Mozambique, who became members of the Bank later.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The new assignment must have been quite a contrast to India. What were the major&#13;
contrasts that you perceived?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, it was really a shock to move from India to East Africa. In a way, it was a&#13;
shock that I have never really quite been able to overcome and which, in the end, may have&#13;
contributed to my failing to secure an assignment at the time of the musical chairs&#13;
reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In 1987.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Because my then boss perceived that I had not sufficient empathy for Africa and for&#13;
Africa's problems, which I think was nonsense, but which was his perception.&#13;
&#13;
No, I was shocked to come to Africa. Africa, at the time when I joined, was beset by a multitude&#13;
of problems. There had been a certain euphoria when the African countries initially became&#13;
independent. Some of them had inherited quite substantial resources. There was this national&#13;
enthusiasm, which carried people forward.&#13;
&#13;
When I first visited East Africa, this had started to evaporate and given way to a lingering sense&#13;
of malaise. There were, all along, terrible weaknesses. There were no or weak institutions in&#13;
East Africa, quite in contrast to India, which had a centuries-old tradition of organized&#13;
government.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So, basically, the British institutions that were left behind hadn't really taken root?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Had not taken root and were not indigenized. The British had run these countries&#13;
like plantations. When they left, there was little left behind. The number of people that were well&#13;
educated and experienced was limited. In many of these countries there was only a handful of&#13;
people who you felt clearly understood what the problems of the country were. There was often&#13;
also a feeling that people were indolent; while you were concerned about the economic problems&#13;
the countries were facing, this concern was not shared by the officials that you dealt with. They&#13;
were interested in having a good time and traveling around, attending conferences all over the&#13;
globe, and buying what was not available at horne. There was also increasingly the sense that&#13;
each of these countries in their own way was exploited by an elite group of people who happened&#13;
to be in power.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, this would have been an indigenous elite?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Indigenous elite, of course, based on tribal origins or whatever, who were exploiting&#13;
the country for the benefit of their group.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: There were also real problems as far as the Bank's activities in these countries are&#13;
concerned. There was a host of projects scattered all over the landscape which were not being&#13;
implemented.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And this was the situation you saw when you arrived?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: There was also a particular problem that affected Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya,&#13;
which had been the members of the former East African Union, who owned a number of&#13;
assets-railways, airlines, ports-which were administered regionally. These countries had kind&#13;
of fallen out. There was enmity between Kenya and Tanzania; you couldn't even cross the border,&#13;
between Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda was in a complete mess with Idi Arnin [Dada]. So the&#13;
regional institutions had stopped functioning, but the Bank had lent quite a bit of money to the&#13;
East African Union, as had other institutions and donors.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now this was to the entity, as opposed to the individual countries?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Exactly. And the debts of the Union were, of course, guaranteed by the members of&#13;
the former East African Union, jointly and severally. In other words, each one was responsible&#13;
for the whole lot. You couldn't realistically expect to recover everything from just one member.&#13;
So since the Bank in those days was still terribly concerned about its record as a lender that was&#13;
not defaulted against, it was important for the Bank to collect these debts. This involved&#13;
complicated negotiations among parties which were not on speaking terms.&#13;
&#13;
In economic terms, the tide had turned against most of the East African countries, in the sense&#13;
that their terms of trade had deteriorated disastrously. In particular, coffee prices had dropped to&#13;
levels never seen before, and as a result, export earnings were severely depressed. So the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006 Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
countries were facing, in addition to their long-term backwardness, acute economic problems&#13;
which the Bank could not ignore.&#13;
&#13;
One of the particular examples was Tanzania, which was in deep trouble. It was run by a&#13;
charismatic Third World leader, Julius Nyerere, Mwalimu or "the teacher" in Swahili, who had&#13;
become prominent worldwide as an imaginative and dedicated leader.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He had been a teacher, hadn't he?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He had been a teacher, and had drunk from the same fountain that Jawaharlal Nehru&#13;
had Â·drunk from at the London School of Economics. He was a dedicated socialist and a&#13;
remarkable figure.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He was an honest leader?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He was totally honest. The only thing you can say was that he was corrupted by the&#13;
sense of his own importance, and that there was clearly a sense of arrogance that was quite&#13;
apparent when you met this fellow. I met him only once, and he was a charming and attractive&#13;
person. But his influence was devastating in economic terms. The focus of much of what he did&#13;
was political. He was interested in establishing a cohesive society in Tanzania and overcoming&#13;
the tribal differences within Tanzania. For this purpose he used the Soviet and East German&#13;
approach to community organization and party control. In fact, the country was always full of&#13;
East German political advisers, who were helping him set up this system of party control. When&#13;
it came to economics, the notion that the market should determine the allocation of resources&#13;
couldn't be further from his mind. He was obsessed with the idea of planning, rationing,&#13;
allocating.&#13;
&#13;
Now, McNamara had met this fellow, and was very impressed with his ideas. In particular, he&#13;
was impressed with the ideas Nyerere had about the need for and the way to stimulate rural&#13;
development in an integrated fashion; that is to say, address the needs of the rural areas in a&#13;
comprehensive way that would include education and health care and the whole gamut of&#13;
marketing and agricultural processing, in addition to production. McNamara had taken this on&#13;
board, and at the Annual Meeting of the Bank inN airobi, I think in 1973, this became the theme&#13;
of his presentation. At the time, it was the key to solving the poverty and development problems&#13;
that he foresaw.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And your view is that he got the idea from, or at least he was influenced by,&#13;
Nyerere?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He was clearly influenced by Nyerere. In Tanzania the Bank supported a whole host&#13;
of these area development projects. Since IDA resources were short-there had been delays in&#13;
IDA replenishment-and since this was considered an unfailing answer to the development&#13;
problems of the country, McNamara had even gone so far as to agree that we should lend Bank&#13;
money in support of some ofthese projects. So by the time I appeared on the scene there,&#13;
Tanzania was with its back against the wall, couldn't service the Bank loans, and didn't have the&#13;
export earnings and foreign exchange resources to continue functioning.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There were also signs that McNamara was disenchanted with what was going on. In the early&#13;
part of my involvement-that is to say late 1979 or early 1980-McNamara went on one more&#13;
visit to Tanzania. I was not involved in this visit. The Regional vice president, Willi [W. A.]&#13;
Wapenhans, handled this on his own. There were meetings with N yerere, but apparently these&#13;
meetings were much more frosty, and there was a recognition that things were not working the&#13;
way they were supposed to work. McNamara, I think, was very disappointed.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Even before you assumed your post in East Africa in 1979, relations between the&#13;
Bank and Tanzania had begun to deteriorate, yet lending rose from $315 million during 1974 to&#13;
1977, to $485 million during 1978 to 1981. Was this a reflection-even though that appears&#13;
counterintuitive, if relations were deteriorating-of increased lending for the rural development?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, no. That had happened earlier. There were a host of other projects in the&#13;
pipeline which you could not simply stop.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, I was confronted with this from the moment I stepped into this assignment. There was&#13;
a plea from all of the countries to give them program assistance; that is to say, to give them&#13;
foreign exchange resources which they could use to finance some of their import bills.&#13;
&#13;
The first Annual Meeting I attended in my new job was in Belgrade, in Yugoslavia, in 1979. At&#13;
that meeting the concept of structural adjustment lending was launched by McNamara and Ernie&#13;
Stem, who wrote the pre-requisite papers. While there was some hesitation initially on the part of&#13;
the major shareholders and the Executive Directors, eventually everybody agreed that this&#13;
needed to become part of the toolkit of the Bank. This involved lending money in the context of&#13;
a framework of sensible economic policy reforms. Those policy reforms entailed shifting from&#13;
controls of imports to a more kind of market-driven system of resource allocations and incentives&#13;
that would determine the allocation of resources. Looking at these various African countries, the&#13;
distance they would have to travel to achieve the conditions that would justify this form of&#13;
lending was often very great, in particular in Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
At the annual meeting in 1979, I had the first opportunity to meet the representatives of the&#13;
various countries in the department. One after another they all told me that they desperately&#13;
needed program-type lending, and that project lending wasn't answering their needs. They&#13;
pointed out that they had a big pipeline of projects under implementation, and loans that were not&#13;
disbursing. In other words, there was little point in adding more to this pipeline, and if the Bank&#13;
wanted to help, it should provide non-project assistance.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now this was a big change for the Bank, too, because according to the Articles of&#13;
Agreement, loans were supposed to be for specific projects, not for generalized aid.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Exactly, although the first loans the Bank made for European reconstruction were&#13;
program-type loans. But the whole concept of structural adjustment was somehow mal apropos&#13;
in Africa, because while the concept itself made sense, it required coherent and rational&#13;
economic management. So while the East African countries could benefit from structural&#13;
adjustment, they did not have the capacity to change their policy framework.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jochen Kraske&#13;
                             March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And make the necessary changes.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: When we approached the management with these proposals for structural&#13;
adjustment, Ernie Stern, in particular, kept saying, "Well, this was not really designed to help&#13;
Africa." Still we went ahead and introduced adjustment programs in some of these countries.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So Ernie Stem was against it?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He was skeptical.&#13;
&#13;
I remember Kenya, which was among the first countries that received one of these loans. Kenya&#13;
was in some ways also fairly relatively flexible with making changes, especially of the exchange&#13;
rate, that would help to make the case for structural adjustment lending.&#13;
&#13;
But in the course of events, all of these programs didn't really work. As part of the conditionality&#13;
for the loan, you picked out certain indicators that were supposed to tell you whether the&#13;
program of reforms was on track. But when you deal with the implementation of the program&#13;
itself, you needed a team of people who clearly understood what needed to be done and who, 24&#13;
hours a day, 365 days a year, implemented the program and made the necessary adjustments&#13;
succeed. But there was nobody who had the knowledge and authority to run the program. The&#13;
Bank had come and recommended what needed to be changed: subsidies had to be cut, prices&#13;
had to be freed, exchange rates adjusted, the budget deficit reduced, allocation to certain&#13;
activities increased. But the sum total of these measures still did not really mean that you had a&#13;
functioning program. The success of the program really was a question ofthe implementation,&#13;
and that required people who understood what needed to be done, why it needed to be done,&#13;
were committed to doing it, and had the means, politically and otherwise, to make decisions.&#13;
You had these people in India after '91, in Indonesia, in China and in Korea, but you didn't have&#13;
these people and these conditions in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, in Tanzania we never even got to first base because Nyerere simply said, "Look, this&#13;
won't do. I will not accept this." I remember the finance minister that I had met in 1979, a&#13;
sensible and very intelligent fellow from the Arusha area, had been persuaded by us, and also by&#13;
the IMF, that Tanzania really needed to do something about the exchange rate. The poor fellow&#13;
had gone and had argued with Nyerere, and tried to persuade him to devalue, only to be fired by&#13;
Nyerere on the spot. Nyerere simply refused to discuss the subject, and yet the pressure to&#13;
provide assistance in fast-disbursing form increased all the time.&#13;
&#13;
So at some point-that might have been to some extent my own idea-we decided that we&#13;
should find some other people who could persuade Nyerere to be more flexible. This was&#13;
discussed and agreed by Nyerere; there would be some panel of wise men, who would take a&#13;
look at the whole situation, and come up with recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So these would be external people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: External people. But now, Nyerere and his people-there was in particular this&#13;
finance minister who was a slippery fellow, Amir H. Jamal, an Ismaili.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This is a different one from the one you were talking about earlier?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes, he was a well known member of the inner circle, quite active internationally, a&#13;
member later of the [Willi] Brandt Commission [Independent Commission on International&#13;
Development Issues]. Anyway, they said, "Look, we agree to this panel, provided we can pick&#13;
the people who will be on it." After some back and forth, we finally agreed. The Tanzanians&#13;
picked some Swedish fellow, a trade union man with solid socialist credentials. He had been a&#13;
minister in the Swedish cabinet, but v.ith little experience in developing countries. The Bank&#13;
paid for this whole exercise, but none of the panelists was ready to bell the cat. They took a look&#13;
at the whole situation, but they didn't come up with any clear-cut recommendations. They were&#13;
browbeaten by the Tanzanians into endorsing, by and large, what they were doing, with minor&#13;
modifications. In any event, it was not sufficient to convince us that there would be the necessary&#13;
changes that would justify program lending. That only happened much later, after Nyerere had&#13;
left and gone into retirement.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: With the reservations that you had noted earlier about program lending, did these&#13;
reservations appear only later, or did the Bank proceed with program lending despite these&#13;
reservations? You said Ernie Stem was somewhat skeptical, but how about yourself?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: We proceeded with these programs despite our reservations. I have to say that, from&#13;
the beginning, I was not really convinced that this would work, but what else could we do to help&#13;
these countries? It was really essential for these countries to get infusions of foreign exchange, if&#13;
they were not going to fold up and go into complete bankruptcy.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Because project lending wasn't working?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Because project lending wasn't working. Project lending wasn't generating the&#13;
foreign exchange flows; in fact, the project disbursements themselves were tied up because the&#13;
foreign exchange resources to fund the complementary imports were not available. So we were&#13;
really in a bind.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So is it fair to say that your judgment was that the best thing to do, the best of a bad&#13;
bargain, would be to try the program lending and see what happens?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: To go along and to use the limited leverage that you had to correct some of the&#13;
worst problems. But, obviously, this was not very successful, and the economic conditions&#13;
continued to deteriorate. I don't think that a different approach would have brought about any&#13;
better results. It is inconceivable that the Bank would have stepped back and said, "Well, thank&#13;
you very much. You're in a mess now. Good luck. Come and talk to us when you're feeling&#13;
better."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 62&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There was also the fact that, in the 1960s and the 1970s, Africa had been a minor player. The&#13;
African countries were slowly emerging from a somnambule existence as colonies into&#13;
nationhood and political presence.&#13;
&#13;
Now, by the end of the 1970s and in the 1980s, there was a growing awareness that Africa really&#13;
was a looming disaster. Various donors, in particular the European Union which, of course, is&#13;
tied to Africa through association treaties, but also the Scandinavian countries, which had been&#13;
very active in Africa all along, the British and also the Americans. So there was a growing effort&#13;
to bring assistance to Africa.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank positioned itself very quickly in a central coordinating role. There was one event&#13;
which projected the Bank's role in Africa. The African countries, under the auspices of the&#13;
African Union, had adopted an ambitious investment plan: the Lagos Plan of Action.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the African governors, in their caucus meeting with McNamara, requested in 1979 an&#13;
analysis of Africa's economic problems in the hope ofleading to recommendations for increased&#13;
aid flows in support of the Lagos Plan. The Bank, in response, assembled a team made up largely&#13;
of Bank economists, led by an outside consultant, Elliot Berg. The "Berg Report" [Accelerated&#13;
Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Agenda for Action. Washington, D.C: The World Bank,&#13;
1981] came up with a devastating indictment of African economic policies, and&#13;
recommendations for wide-ranging economic reforms.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the Africans were terribly upset. There were many meetings and furious exchanges&#13;
between the Bank and devoted Africa supporters, especially on the left and in Oxford. But the&#13;
report, with some revisions, became the background to an increasing role of the Bank in Africa&#13;
as a coordinator of increased aid, and as an advocate of economic reforms.&#13;
&#13;
Now, for us in the trenches of the Bank's administration, this meant that we had consultative&#13;
groups for practically all countries. I spent much time going back and forth to Paris and attending&#13;
meetings with other donors to discuss the investment program and the necessary reforms. It was,&#13;
in fact, on one of these occasions when the Tanzanian group met in Paris that we finally achieved&#13;
a breakthrough to reform with the finance minister of Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You talked about the East African Community earlier on. Were you involved, in&#13;
any sense, with Victor Umbricht, who was the Bank's mediator for the East African&#13;
Community?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I was closely involved with him. He was working with me. His task was to identify&#13;
the assets of the former East African Community, allocate these assets, and then attribute the&#13;
liabilities associated with these assets among the three partner states. In the end, he was to&#13;
determine which debts had to be serviced by which country.&#13;
&#13;
This was a very tedious and long-term process. He did a wonderful job. He was as patient as Job.&#13;
He was spending countless hours and days sitting with the officials and going over all these&#13;
details. He had a host of accounting firms going through the books of the Community. He was&#13;
able to pull this off, and put together an agreement that was signed and ratified by the three&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    63&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
partner states, and that put this particular problem behind us. It is rare that you can say in history&#13;
that problems of this nature can be resolved, but this one was really resolved, and it was resolved&#13;
by Victor Umbricht.&#13;
&#13;
He had been a senior officer of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Ciba-Geigy. He had been in&#13;
the Swiss foreign service initially, and had wonderful stories to tell about his assignment to&#13;
Turkey during the Second World War. He joined the Bank in 1950, and spent a number of years&#13;
here. So he was well acquainted with the Bank and the UN.&#13;
&#13;
The only other noteworthy event that I might just mention was attending a meeting that had been&#13;
organized in 1980 in Harare--! guess at that point it was still called Salisbury. Zimbabwe&#13;
achieved independence after the fake independence, referred to as UD I.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Unilateral Declaration of Independence.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Unilateral Declaration of Independence of Southern Rhodesia. This had become the&#13;
real independence in 1979 at a conference in Britain, chaired by Lord Soames. Robert Mugabe&#13;
and his ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] Party gained a majority in parliament and&#13;
took over.&#13;
&#13;
In 1980, people recognized the needed to mobilize resources for Zimbabwe on a l?fge scale. The&#13;
government hosted a large gathering of friends and donors, which I attended as the head of the&#13;
Bank delegation. It turned out that this meeting was, in fact, more a political exercise than the&#13;
typical business-minded development finance exercise the Bank was usually involved in. This&#13;
meant that at this meeting it was especially all these other African countries who were sounding&#13;
off, congratulating Zimbabwe and pledging support. I still remember one of the countries that&#13;
was very vocal was Sierra Leone, which at that time was hopelessly in arrears in its debt service&#13;
to the Bank, but at this conference proudly pledged $1 million or $500,000. We spent the whole&#13;
day sitting in this meeting chaired by the fellow who was then the finance minister of Zimbabwe.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Bernard [Thomas] Chidzero?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Bernard Chidzero, yes. He was a wonderful character. He had been outside of&#13;
Rhodesia during much of the turmoil and had been, in fact, sheltered in some UN organization in&#13;
Geneva. He had come back to Zimbabwe and had become the finance minister. I dealt with him&#13;
on this occasion, and also over the next several years. He always addressed me as "comrade,"&#13;
because my name led him to associate me with the Russian comrades he had dealt with on other&#13;
occasions. He clearly felt rather a bit uneasy because he was not an insider in the clique of&#13;
Mugabe. He was not one of the people who had fought in the bush in Mozambique for the&#13;
independence of Zimbabwe. So he was a bit insecure.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So you were sitting among a lot of African supporters of Zimbabwe?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006 Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, they weren't only African supporters. I mean, there was the whole gamut of&#13;
donors and organizations gathered on this occasion, but the tone of the whole meeting was&#13;
distinctly political, and we were given short shrift. So our tum to speak came pretty close to the&#13;
end ofthe whole parade of donors and representatives. I had been authorized by Ernie Stem to&#13;
pledge what I thought was a fairly generous amount of assistance. Even though I came at the end&#13;
of this list, the amount of money that I pledged on behalf of the Bank certainly matched the sum&#13;
total of all the numbers mentioned before. I forget the number we were talking about, but it may&#13;
have been something like $100 million a year.&#13;
&#13;
Now, my colleagues in the [Eastern] Africa Region drafted a statement for me to make, which I&#13;
thought was an interesting statement; it was also somewhat aggressive because it kind of brought&#13;
into this meeting a sense of realism, a meeting which otherwise was so charged with all this&#13;
political rhetoric and full of self-congratulatory smiles. It projected some of the experiences other&#13;
African countries had made since independence, and expressed the hope that Zimbabwe would&#13;
be able to learn from those experiences and avoid mistakes made by these other countries and&#13;
focus, in particular, on a sensible policy that was dealing with land reform in a constructive way.&#13;
&#13;
There was a bit of a silence after I finished with this speech. Our friend Chidzero, rather than&#13;
expressing the encomiums he had expressed at the end of every speech and you would have&#13;
expected, given the amount of money that we were bringing to the table, simply said, "Thank&#13;
you very much. Now next, please." He was clearly concerned that what we had said could put a&#13;
damper on the festive mood of the gathering.&#13;
&#13;
I was somewhat amused when later that same afternoon I was ending up in the elevator with the&#13;
then secretary of the Commonwealth, Shridath Ramp hal. He went out of his way to comment on&#13;
my statement and to congratulate us for making this statement. But I have to say he was the only&#13;
one who did so on this occasion.&#13;
&#13;
The only other thing might have been that in the evening there was a reception, and Mugabe was&#13;
also at this reception. At some point I was passing through the line and shook hands with&#13;
Mugabe. He smiled a little and expressed his appreciation and gratitude. I had the feeling that he&#13;
must have been briefed on what happened.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, Jochen, we'll continue with your experiences with Bangladesh and Nepal. In&#13;
July 1991 you began an 18-month period as director of South Asia Country Department 1, which&#13;
included Bangladesh, Bhutan, and NepaL What occasioned this move?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I had spent, again, close to four years in New Delhi, and it was time for me to come&#13;
back to headquarters. This move was a bit of a rehabilitation. Barber Conable felt very badly&#13;
about the whole reorganization; it was an event that took place right when he joined the Bank,&#13;
really without his control, and yet under his name and with his blessing. He had come to see&#13;
some of the problems ofthe reorganization as he became more familiar with the Bank and its&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I was on the Executive Committee of the Staff Association at that time, and I heard&#13;
him say, "This is my reorganization." So he didn't try to fob it off. He took responsibility for it.&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yes. But he also came to recognize the shortcomings of this whole exercise.&#13;
&#13;
I had come to know him a little, both before the reorganization when I traveled with him to East&#13;
Africa, and then again when he visited India. I think he had seen what happened to me, and was&#13;
trying to make it up to me. No sooner did I come back to Washington to take on my new&#13;
assignment, when he invited me to lunch. While, of course, he didn't tell me that he felt sorry,&#13;
there was in this gesture, and the way he talked to me about the problems he experienced as the&#13;
president, a hint of an apology.&#13;
&#13;
So I took on this new position, and it quickly involved me in two major controversial projects.&#13;
&#13;
One was a big bridge Bangladesh tried to build across the Jamuna River. The river is very wide,&#13;
and the bridge had to be huge. It was to connect two halves of the country almost, which&#13;
otherwise were connected only by very cumbersome ferry services.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Fairly primitive.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: They were time-consuming, unreliable and difficult, especially for the movement of&#13;
trucks. There were many who were skeptical about the feasibility of this bridge because of the&#13;
difficult soil conditions in Bangladesh. There is no bedrock to put your pylons on; you have to&#13;
sink everything into the mud. Yet these pylons had to carry substantial weights because of the&#13;
length of the bridge and its span. We did go ahead and made a loan for this bridge. The bridge&#13;
was constructed, and, I believe, it proved a success.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the other project was the so-called Arun project in Nepal [Arun III hydroelectric project],&#13;
which was a relatively small, run-of-the-river power project which the Nepalis wanted to build in&#13;
a fairly remote area. The remoteness was one of the key problems; you had to build a 200-&#13;
kilometer stretch of road to bring in all the supplies and construction equipment. So there were&#13;
quickly all kinds of environmental concerns about this road.&#13;
&#13;
The other problem was that the cost of this project-including, in particular, the construction of&#13;
the road, which was, of course, charged to the project-was fairly large in relation to the GDP of&#13;
Nepal, the foreign exchange earnings of Nepal, etcetera. Whatever comparator you wanted to&#13;
use, in every respect this project seemed disproportionately large and costly. Apart from the&#13;
environmental concern of the road and the considerations of cost and economy, there were also&#13;
the people who opposed any kind of dam as a matter of principle. In other words, as time went&#13;
on, there was a coalition of critics from different quarters who objected to this project and started&#13;
to build up pressure on the Bank. When the new President [James D.] Wolfensohn came into&#13;
office and found himself confronted with this barrage of hostility he very quickly decided to drop&#13;
this project.&#13;
&#13;
I think this was a pity. I should say that I went to Nepal on a number of occasions and discussed&#13;
this whole question with the Nepalese. Nepal is in a very difficult situation as far as energy is&#13;
concerned. The country is full of the most spectacular potential for the development of&#13;
hydroelectric power. There is a severe shortage of electricity in Nepal. There are a few small&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
thermal power plants, but, by and large, people are driven to satisfy their energy needs by cutting&#13;
down trees. So, progressively, you can see throughout the country the hillsides denuded;&#13;
environmentally, the most disastrous consequences are plain to see. Here you find on the one&#13;
hand an environmental movement which gets totally bent out of shape by the attempt to&#13;
construct a project which was in itself a very innocent project. It was a run-of-the-river project,&#13;
which means there's no pending of water, or any significant impact on the environment.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So there was very little that environmentalists should be concerned about in this&#13;
particular project?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. And what I thought was particularly attractive about this project was that&#13;
there would be a surplus of electricity, and that surplus could be sold to India across the border.&#13;
It would establish a pattern of Nepal-India cooperation in the energy field, with Nepal generating&#13;
electricity and exporting that electricity to India. This would be the basis for the gigantic&#13;
schemes which have been talked about for a long time. They have not so far materialized, in part&#13;
because they're expensive, but also because, in order for these projects to become viable, there&#13;
would have to be a close understanding between Nepal and India about the sale of this&#13;
electricity, and of India assuming responsibility for servicing the debt associated with the&#13;
construction of these projects. I always thought that the Arun project could be a model/prototype&#13;
that might encourage people to look further and develop some other schemes.&#13;
&#13;
Now, in my discussions with the Nepalis I of course tried to explain to them that the Arun&#13;
project was going to give us disproportionate headaches and, furthermore, that it was very costly&#13;
and not really the answer to the short-term energy needs that they had. When looking at the&#13;
various alternatives, I said, the most sensible and rational idea was to import power from India. I&#13;
suggested that the Bank might be prepared to support the construction of coal-based power plants&#13;
in India for the express purpose of delivering electricity to Nepal. Bihar and UP in India had&#13;
these coal mines, and they could construct these power stations on top of these mines and&#13;
generate electricity relatively cheaply.&#13;
&#13;
The Nepalis were deeply offended and clearly suspicious, since I had a history of involvement&#13;
with India. They looked at me as some agent of the imperialist designs of the Indians, and that&#13;
pretty much shot my credibility. But I still believe that this would be the most sensible thing that&#13;
they could do in the short term. Nepal has to look at itself in cohabitation with India, and needs&#13;
to find a modus operandi to work with India, in particular in the energy field, but also in&#13;
irrigation and various other areas. But from the environmental point of view, I can see that if&#13;
they were ever to consider developing some of these hydroelectric sites, you would have the&#13;
entire environmental movement on your back, in total ignorance of the devastation that&#13;
environmentally is taking place in the country because of the lack of energy.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Speaking of Nepal, as I am sure you know, it has been, as oflate, undergoing&#13;
considerable turmoil from Marxist guerillas, and apparently now a rather autocratic king. Had&#13;
these difficulties arisen during your period in Nepal? .&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No. Of course, this Marxist movement has been a traditional movement in Nepal,&#13;
but it has waxed and waned. It would be more active, more virulent at certain times, and less in&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     67&#13;

&#13;
                                                       because of the political instability in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: But this was all after your time.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: This was after my time. It was a relatively quiet and reasonably orderly period of&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: With regard to Bangladesh, now of course that was a descendant of the old British&#13;
Raj, also. It had been part of British India. Did it inherit the civil service traditions that the&#13;
Indians did? You spoke of a very highly disciplined, organized, honest, non-corrupt civil service&#13;
in India. Was that tradition shared in Bangladesh?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: That tradition was shared in Bangladesh to some extent. But two things. First of all,&#13;
Bangladesh had been independent from the U.K., but the existence of Bangladesh had gone&#13;
through the Pakistan filter as one of the parts of Pakistan-East Pakistan-suffering&#13;
discrimination, which ultimately led to the breakup.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, Bengal-whether in India, West Bengal, or in Bangladesh, East Bengal-has always&#13;
been rather unruly. The Bengalis are wonderful. They are beautiful people. They are very&#13;
spirited, very interested in literature and music. Many prominent Indian writers and philosophers&#13;
are Bengalis. This tradition was very much shared both in the agricultural East [Bengal] and in&#13;
the more cosmopolitan West Bengal. When I first started to work in the Bank as a loan officer in&#13;
the Pakistan Division, I visited then-East Pakistan several times. But, it was a pretty hopeless&#13;
kind of place. It was, in many ways, comparable to the situation in Africa: institutionally weak,&#13;
and terribly poor.&#13;
&#13;
Nowadays, Bangladesh is considered a success story. Bangladesh has had a fairly consistent&#13;
record of steady growth. The only thing that is escaping them is political stability. There are&#13;
these two ladies who are taking turns running the country and sniping at each other. There is&#13;
constant squabbling and protesting and demonstrating, and a lot of wasted motion. But&#13;
notwithstanding these frictions and notwithstanding the topography of the whole country, which&#13;
makes it prone to the most devastating flood disasters, Bangladesh has made considerable&#13;
progress in the last 10 to 15 years.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: There was some contention over the eastern waters question between Bangladesh&#13;
and India. Did you get involved in that at all?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I was first exposed to this problem right after I joined the Bank. You remember I&#13;
mentioned that as a Young Professional I was asked to do some file studies.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               68&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I did one file study on the Calcutta port. The Calcutta Port is on the Hooghli River.&#13;
The Hooghli is a sidearm of the Ganges, and flows into the sea. The main problem of the&#13;
Hooghli and the Calcutta port is the silting, and the need for constant dredging. One of the&#13;
solutions to deal with the silting problem was "flushing the Hooghli," by diverting large water&#13;
flows from the Ganges. This required construction of a barrage on the Ganges River at the point&#13;
where the Hooghli takes off. The Indians had been considering this proposition for some time,&#13;
but for the downstream riparian-East Pakistan and later Bangladesh-this proposal was&#13;
anathema. I remember in my file study, when I came to this topic there was a black hole. The&#13;
topic was highly explosive and not to be mentioned or discussed by anybody because the&#13;
downstream concerns of Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
At various times, there were discussions between India and Pakistan, and later India and&#13;
Bangladesh, on this topic. But agreement on the releases of water that would be made by India,&#13;
especially during the dry season before the monsoon in the summer, was never reached. They&#13;
were close at one point. A close friend of ours, who was foreign secretary, was very proactive in&#13;
trying to settle this problem and reach agreement on the construction of the so-called Farakka&#13;
Barrage.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: A final question on this aspect of your career. How would you characterize the&#13;
relations between the government of Bangladesh and the Bank during your tenure?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Close. Khalida Zia was the prime minister during my tenure. Her finance minister&#13;
was a charming and dedicated person. He relied on the Bank, and appreciated the advice which&#13;
we offered. He had a very close relationship with our representative in Dhaka, Chris [Christopher&#13;
R.] Willoughby, so much so that at some point there were some of his underlings in the ministry&#13;
complaining that they were left out of the loop with the finance minister. In short, I mean, our&#13;
relationship was close, and there was agreement on what needed to be done to keep the economy&#13;
moving.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: With effect from January 1, 1993, you became the first-and, so far, only--official&#13;
historian of the World Bank Group, in charge of the World Bank Group Historical Office. How&#13;
did this appointment come about?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, two things. First of all, I had been interested in the Bank's history. After all,&#13;
by then I was part of the Bank's history myself. Secondly, I was closely acquainted with Bill&#13;
Diamond, who was the "father" of World Bank history, and who had been instrumental in the&#13;
launching ofthe 50-year history project [Kapur, Devesh, John P. Lewis, and Richard Webb. The&#13;
World Bank: Its First HalfCentury. Washington, D.C., Brookings Institution Press, 1997], which&#13;
was a copy ofthe 25-year history project [Mason, Edward, and Robert E. Asher. The World Bank&#13;
Since Bretton Woods. Washington, D.C., Brookings Institution, 1973], involving the Brookings&#13;
Institution, but of course a different set of authors. John Lewis was heading the project, with&#13;
Richard [C.] Webb from Peru and Devesh Kapur, who wrote his Ph.D. with John Lewis, as co-&#13;
authors. Bill Diamond had launched this project, and in that context he had written a general&#13;
report about the Bank's history. This report covered other aspects as well, including the need to&#13;
continue doing oral histories.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And about archives, also.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: About the archives, and the need to beef up the organization to cope with the&#13;
undigested material piling up. He also mentioned the desirability of appointing a person as the&#13;
historian of the Banlc&#13;
&#13;
I was then 60 years of age, and my active life in the Bank was approaching its end. At some time&#13;
I talked to my friend Bil Alisbah, who happened to be the Vice President for Personnel and&#13;
Administration, and mentioned to him that I would be interested in this job, ifthe Bank were&#13;
ever to create such a position. I had thought that I would continue in my present assignment until&#13;
about two or three years before retirement, and then shift into this history position, an assignment&#13;
of two or three years' duration. But then, much to my surprise-in fact in the middle of the night,&#13;
while I was traveling in Tokyo-! received a telephone call from Bil Alisbah, who told me that&#13;
they would like to offer me the position as a historian. I said, oh, that was wonderful, I'll think&#13;
about it. But Alisbah said could I think about it quickly because they needed to make various&#13;
decisions. In particular, they were anxious to kind of fill the position which I was then occupying&#13;
with somebody else. So I said, "Well, give me 20 minutes." So I rang off and talked to my wife,&#13;
and we said, "Okay, let's do it." So I called him back 20 minutes later and said, "Okay, I'll be&#13;
happy to do it."&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
ZIEGLER: We just talked about how you came to be appointed as historian of the Bank. How&#13;
did you go about setting up the World Bank Group Historical Office?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I came back from this trirr-this must have been in November or December 1992-&#13;
and in January of '93 I took over the Historian's Office. I had to go about finding some office&#13;
space, finding a secretary, in due course also finding an assistant. In all of this endeavor I was&#13;
greatly assisted by Bill Diamond, who was the spiritual father of this whole exercise, and was&#13;
clearly very interested in making sure it succeeded. So he became a consultant to the office&#13;
pretty much from the start. I think he was on a fairly regular basis at least two days a week with&#13;
me in this office.&#13;
&#13;
Through him I got in touch with a number of other people; in particular, Lou [Louis] Galambos&#13;
of Johns Hopkins University, a historian there who has written on industrial history in particular,&#13;
and Bill [William H.] Becker, who was a professor of history at The George Washington&#13;
University.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He was also doing oral history interviews.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So the three of them-Bill Diamond, Galambos, and Becker-became a supporting&#13;
framework of advice. We would have meetings fairly regularly, once a month or so, when we&#13;
would sit together and discuss what needed to be done.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20,2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  70&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now Galambos also was quick to supply us with somebody who could be my assistant in this&#13;
office. He was a Ph.D. student of his. I was perfectly willing to accept his recommendation and&#13;
to follow his advice. In retrospect, I think that was a mistake. The Ph.D. student was clearly&#13;
preoccupied with getting his Ph.D. done and, secondly, Galambos tended to look at him as one of&#13;
his resources, and therefore much of the time that this fellow had available was diverted in other&#13;
directions. He edited some of the oral history interviews we did. I don't think that this was a job&#13;
very well done.&#13;
&#13;
Now, to the work of the office. The first item of business was to get on top of what was&#13;
happening to the 50-year history project. This project had pretty much run aground.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: It eventually did come out as The World Bank: Its First Half Century.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. But this project had been launched in 1989, and the target for completion was&#13;
1993. When I appeared on the scene, the authors had yet to put pen to paper. There wasn't a&#13;
single page written of this history. There was a program of consultations proceeding at a&#13;
leisurely pace. John Lewis and Richard Webb would meet with all kinds of gurus, sometimes&#13;
invited under the auspices of the Brookings Institution. People like I. G. Patel would come from&#13;
afar to meet and sit around the table in the Brookings Institution and discuss. But all this had yet&#13;
to result even in a firmly agreed outline or table of contents of this history.&#13;
&#13;
The people in charge of this project at the Brookings Institution were becoming increasingly&#13;
frustrated and desperate. So my role in this project was to expedite it, even though it was not a&#13;
Bank project. It was expressly a project managed by the Brookings Institution, and separate from&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Part of the problem the project was facing was a growing sense of unease and suspicion on the&#13;
part of senior managers in the Bank because nothing was forthcoming. Nobody had seen&#13;
anything of this project. I tried to develop some mechanism, in conjunction with the management&#13;
of the Bank, to have regular consultations between top people in the Bank and the authors. This&#13;
didn't succeed very well, in part because everybody was so prickly.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: On both sides?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: On both sides, yes, on both sides. Because John Lewis and his fellows had the&#13;
suspicion that the Bank was trying to impose on them a particular script, trying to limit their&#13;
autonomy, and keeping them from writing what they felt they needed to write.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Would you disagree with that view?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I disagree. I feel still that the concept of this history was not well understood by&#13;
John Lewis, in particular. I think he was a poor choice for the job, because he was not a good&#13;
manager and writer. The fact that this project had been lingering, and that no progress had been&#13;
made, was attributable to the fact that he just couldn't bring things to closure. He himself was&#13;
never a prolific writer. He had picked a number of topics that he decided he wanted to work on. I&#13;
think he decided to pick these chapters because he had written on these topics before and felt he&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
did not need much work on them. I think he should have done exactly the opposite and picked&#13;
topics that he knew nothing about and assigned the topics familiar to him to some of his cohorts.&#13;
&#13;
The problems increased, and at some point Brookings just decided to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At Brookings-there had been a change in management at Brookings, and the new head of the&#13;
Brookings Institution, presented with this project, said, "What is this? This is nonsense. Let's just&#13;
drop it." So there was a good chance that the whole project might not have been completed.&#13;
&#13;
In the meantime, among them the three authors-in particular Devesh Kapur-sat dovvn and&#13;
vvTote chapters and chapters on topics that initially he knew nothing about; for instance, the&#13;
finance part of the Bank. These chapters were well done and well researched. But even this late&#13;
in the game-we're talking '95 or '96-there was nothing to show how this whole thing was&#13;
going to fit together. There were chapters that were in the outline, important chapters, like the&#13;
chapter dealing with Eastern Europe, and a chapter dealing with industry and infrastructure, that&#13;
ha,d not been written and were dropped. At some point, they did farm out a chapter on IFC to a&#13;
long-retired Bank staff member from Iceland.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, Jonas [H.] Haralz.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Haralz, yes.&#13;
&#13;
By '96 there were a bunch of chapters. There was a series of two or three chapters Richard Webb&#13;
had written on the idea of poverty, the Bank's identification of poverty as a key objective. There&#13;
were chapters on agriculture and program lending by John Lewis. And there were the chapters by&#13;
Devesh Kapur on finance. At some point they just decided let's just put it together, put a cover&#13;
on it, and publish it.&#13;
&#13;
When the discussion came up about what title they should pick for this exercise, I recommended&#13;
that they should call it "Essays in the History of the World Bank," rather than anything that&#13;
suggested that this was the definitive history of the institution over the first 50 years of its life.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now there are two volumes: one large narrative volume with Kapur, Lewis and&#13;
Webb, and then there was a second, smaller volume with something like a dozen essays on&#13;
various topics related to the Bank by individual authors from outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. So the 50 year history under the auspices of the Brookings Institution was&#13;
one item of preoccupation. A second item was my own pet project.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: For the record, this was a book authored by you, along with William H. Becker,&#13;
Â·william Diamond and Louis Galambos, and the title is Bankers with a Mission: The Presidents&#13;
of the World Bank, 1946 to 1991, published for the World Bank by Oxford University Press in&#13;
1996. So how did you start this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                               March 3, 13 and 20, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, it really started because, looking back, I was struck by the fact that people&#13;
always seemed to glorify the past. In the Bank there were many people who would talk in&#13;
glowing terms about how the Bank of old had been such a wonderful place, and that the&#13;
leadership of the Bank had been responsible for this wonderful state of affairs. In particular,&#13;
throughout my career in the Bank, people were always speaking in glowing terms about Eugene&#13;
Black, what a wonderful person he had been, and how he had created the Bank from nothing and&#13;
built it into this respected institution. I had never met Eugene Black. So I was curious, started to&#13;
kind of read up on him, and eventually began to write something about him.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now this was while you were the historian.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: While I was the historian. I started to write about him, and this developed into a&#13;
story which covered both his personality and also his coming to the World Bank, and his record&#13;
in the Bank. The paper I wrote was then reviewed by Galambos, Diamond and Becker.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, I know Bill Diamond knew Black. I mean, he had personal experience with&#13;
Black during his time in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: He did. Anyway, so then the idea came up that we should write something similar&#13;
about other presidents as well. So the next thing was a chapter on McNamara, which I wrote.&#13;
&#13;
I think it must have been at that point that we decided we should write about others as well, and&#13;
see if we can have a collection of biographies of all the presidents. Bill Diamond undertook to&#13;
write about [John J.] McCloy and Bill Becker agreed to write about [Eugene] Meyer, the first&#13;
president of the Bank. So it became more of an organized project.&#13;
&#13;
Subsequent to the work on the McNamara chapter, I wrote then the chapter on George Woods,&#13;
who in contrast to Black had been much disliked by many people in the Bank. Bill Becker wrote&#13;
the chapters on [Alden Winship "Tom"] Clausen, and on Conable. Eventually, we had the whole&#13;
collection to look at and to edit. We also shared our drafts with the authors of the Bank's&#13;
history, and got their input. In due course, the book was published by the Bank in 1996.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did you receive much guidance or interference from those to whom you reported in&#13;
the course not just of writing but just in your administration of the Bank's Historical Office?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No. I have to say that I was completely left to myself, which was one of the&#13;
blessings of this assignment. Organizationally, I was reporting to the Vice President for&#13;
Personnel and Administration, which initially was my friend Bil Alisbah. We met on a regular&#13;
basis anyway, so we may have discussed my work. I remember there were some issues that I&#13;
took up with him. For instance, I wanted to have access to the personnel files of the Bank, and&#13;
this met with some difficulty. There were restrictions, but eventually we worked out some&#13;
solution that allowed me to have this access, but I had to go through some procedural hurdles.&#13;
&#13;
Then, of course, he left the Bank. His successor became [S.] Shahid Husain, who had a&#13;
reputation for being not very easy to deal with. I had known Shahid, but I had never worked with&#13;
him. I had no problem getting along with him. I would go on a regular basis and talk to him&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    about what I was doing. I was giving him copies of what I wrote. He expressed interest in my&#13;
    work, but without trying to interfere.&#13;
&#13;
    ZIEGLER: So you were pretty much left alone.&#13;
&#13;
    KRASKE: So I was pretty much left alone. Then, finally, he left, and was succeeded by a&#13;
    Japanese lady.&#13;
&#13;
~   ZIEGLER: Oh, Dorothy [H.] Berry?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    When my p5th birthday approached everybody seemed to have forgotten me. I thought, "Well,&#13;
    what happens if I never talk to anybody about it? Perhaps, I would just sit there and continue&#13;
    until I drop dead."&#13;
&#13;
    ZIEGLER: You could still be there for all we know.&#13;
&#13;
    KRASKE: I could still be there.&#13;
&#13;
    ZIEGLER: Jochen, as you know, the IMF has had the post of historian for many years. It must&#13;
    be at least 40 years, going back to the mid '60s. Please compare and contrast the functions and&#13;
    resources of that position with yours, as you saw it.&#13;
&#13;
    KRASKE: Well, I mean, the IMF has gone about its history in a much more organized fashion.&#13;
&#13;
    The Bank's history is remembered only occasionally, and those occasions in the past have been&#13;
    the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Bank, and later the 50th anniversary. But history is&#13;
    ongoing, and is a process which, especially for an institution like the World Bank, is essential. I&#13;
    think it is critical that there should be a formalized way to record the history of the institution and&#13;
    the evolution of its policies. But, unfortunately, this function in the Bank has been considered to&#13;
    be of secondary importance, and has never been accepted into the organizational and budgetary&#13;
    plan of the institution.&#13;
&#13;
    As you remember, at the luncheon recently with [Paul D.] Wolfowitz, we drew his attention to&#13;
    this lacuna. He seemed to pick up the point, and promised to review the situation and declared&#13;
    that since he was a history buff himself, he would look at it favorably. But nothing, as far as I&#13;
    can make out, has happened since.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   74&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As an ear and eyewitness, I can say that you were quite eloquent in talking to him&#13;
about the importance of institutional history. And we gave him a copy of your book on the&#13;
presidents, and we're given to understand he's actually reading it.&#13;
&#13;
Is there anything else you'd like to say about your work in the Office of the Historian?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: The only thing I should say is that I thought that if the Bank were to adopt the&#13;
Fund's model, this would entail publishing historical records at regular intervals, recording and&#13;
analyzing what was happening in the institution, and how the institution was positioning itself in&#13;
a changing world. In the IMF this is being done every 10 years, and I thought this would also be&#13;
a sensible time period to cover in the Bank. I felt that the principal function of this office should&#13;
be to make sure that the material required to produce these histories was assembled and&#13;
organized properly, so that whoever would come along-and this might not be necessarily the&#13;
institutional historian himself; this could well be an outsider, or somebody who specializes in&#13;
this field-would have access to a digest of historical events. For this purpose, it would be good&#13;
to produce a chronology. I am glad to hear from you and to see that the Archives in the Bank&#13;
have taken this on, and that they are now producing a regular digest.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: There's a regular chronology. In fact, it's accessible on-line.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It is clearly important to go beyond this when vvTiting the history of the Bank, and to&#13;
reflect on the political circumstances that motivate the actions of the Bank. This would require&#13;
insight into the record of Board discussions. Unlike in the Fund, where these records are edited&#13;
and rewritten by the participants on a regular basis, in the Bank we have the great advantage of&#13;
an unexpurgated verbatim transcript of what was said at these Board meetings.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: But these are inaccessible for research.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: But these are, unfortunately, not accessible.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As Historian, were you able to get access to them?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I was able to get access. As a Bank staff member, you can have access to these&#13;
transcripts. They're kept in the Secretary's Department. But you are not allowed to quote the&#13;
transcript, or even refer to it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You've had a long and varied career in the Bank. How would you briefly&#13;
characterize what the Bank has meant to you?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: If I think about the role the Bank has played in my life, I have to go beyond&#13;
emphasizing job satisfaction and professional accomplishments: it was early on that I met a&#13;
fellow Young Professional, who became my wife and lifelong partner. Not only do I feel&#13;
indebted to the Bank for our introduction, I also must admit that much of what I accomplished is&#13;
due to her sacrifice and faithful support.&#13;

ZIEGLER: Well, Jochen, this brings to an end your oral history interview. You've had a long,&#13;
distinguished, and eventful career in the Bank, and I think this is going to be one of the&#13;
highlights of the oral history collection. So I thank you very much for participating in this&#13;
program.&#13;

KRASKE: You are welcome.&#13;

            On March 3, 13, and 20, 2006, Jochen
            Kraske was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group
            Archives oral history program by Charles Ziegler. During his
            tenure at the Bank from 1964 to 1997, Mr. Kraske worked in
            the following areas: as a young professional (1964); as an
            economist in the departments of South Asia (1965-1966) and
            Asia (1966-1967); as division chief in the departments of
            East Asia and Pacific (EAP), division E (1967-1971), the
            South Asia, division B (1971-1972), South Asia country
            programs, division 2B (1973-1974), and South Asia country
            programs, division A (1974-1975); in New Delhi, India as
            chief of resident mission (1975-1979, 1987-1991), in the
            eastern Africa region country programs department
            (1979-1987); in the South Asia region as director of country
            department 1 (1991-1992); and as historian to the World Bank
            (1993-1997). His transcript concerns his work in India. From
            the moment India became independent, the political
            leadership of India informed economic development throughout
            its various levels of economy.
