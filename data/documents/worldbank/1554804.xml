SUMMARY&#13;
Dominican Republic is an open economy with a relatively small&#13;
domestic market.    In the 1970s an external climate favorable to its&#13;
principal exports -- sugar and minerals together with a stable domestic&#13;
environment led to an average growth rate for GDP of 6.3% for the&#13;
decade.&#13;
Towards the end of the decade a number of external shocks on&#13;
oil prices, terms of trade and higher interest rates presented major&#13;
problems.     Historically   the  economy   largely  followed   an  import&#13;
substitution style of development.    Little effort was made to develop&#13;
exports  beyond  the  traditional   primary  goods.    Central  government&#13;
finances were heavily dependent on revenues from trade while among&#13;
public enterprises economic efficiency was not a paramount concern and&#13;
generally they produced deficits.&#13;
In the bouyant economic milieu of the 1970s this overall policy&#13;
approach led to a reasonable performance on price levels, external and&#13;
domestic balance with less success on employment.       However when the&#13;
situation began to deteriorate towards the end of decade and continued&#13;
downwards   to   the  present   time  weakness   in   policy  making   and&#13;
institutional structure began to surface.       Thus  there was a steady&#13;
deterioration in the debt situation as the Government borrowed heavily&#13;
for balance of payments support in 1981 and 1982 leading to the current&#13;
near crisis situation. Various investments financed by external sources&#13;
over the 'good' years do not appear to be fulfilling their promise so&#13;
that the overall strategy in that area must be open to question.       The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vii -&#13;
analysis in this paper suggests that under any reasonably likely&#13;
external scenario Dominican Republic will not be able to achieve an&#13;
acceptable per capita economic growth over the next decade without major&#13;
shifts in policy.&#13;
They should move towards a unified exchange rate. The phasing&#13;
of this is quite important.     On the export side manufactures, tourism&#13;
and non-traditional exports should be moved quickly to the parallel&#13;
market with most other exports being moved over a longer time period.&#13;
Most imports except for petroleum and essential foodstuffs could be&#13;
moved quickly while the exceptions could be phased in over a five year&#13;
period.   This phasing should be coupled with fiscal and institutional&#13;
changes; the former to ensure that at worst the net government revenues&#13;
should not suffer from the change, the latter to provide meaningful&#13;
support for exports at all levels. The employment situation requires a&#13;
major shift in factor pricing together with a rethinking of investment&#13;
strategy. For instance it might be more useful to seek a better balance&#13;
between   expenditures   on   capital   and   those  on   management   and&#13;
maintenance.   Where desirable substitution possibilities exist capital&#13;
goods should not be imported at preferential rates.&#13;
In the short term these policy initiatives will probably make&#13;
little difference but should lay the base for a more bouyant and&#13;
versatile economy over the medium- to long-term.&#13;
This paper develops an analytical framework to examine these&#13;
various policy alternatives.     The mathematics is deliberately designed&#13;
to be relatively transparent so that economic judgement can be&#13;
incorporated and yet the main macro accounts are consistent.&#13;

RESUMEN&#13;
La Repuiblica Dominicana es un pais con economia abierta y un mercado&#13;
interno relativamente pequefio. Durante la decada de 1970 su PIB aument6 a una&#13;
tasa media de 6,3%, gracias a un clima externo favorable a sus principales pro-&#13;
ductos de exportaci6n --azucar y minerales-- y a un clima nacional estable.&#13;
Hacia el final de la decada varias conmociones externas relacionadas&#13;
con los precios del petr6leo, los terminos de intercambio y los elevados tipos&#13;
de interes crearon graves problemas. Tradicionalmente la economia habia adop-&#13;
tado un tipo de desarrollo basado en gran parte en la sustituci6n de importacio-&#13;
nes. El pais hizo muy poco por incrementar sus exportaciones, limit&amp;ndose a&#13;
exportar productos primarios tradicionales. Las finanzas del Gobierno central&#13;
dependian fuertemente de los ingresos provenientes del comercio, en tanto que&#13;
las empresas publicas --en las cuales la eficiencia econ6mica no era un punto de&#13;
gran interes-- en general arrojaron deficit.&#13;
En el ambiente econ6mico pr6spero de los afios setenta esa politica&#13;
global dio resultados razonables en cuanto a niveles de precios y a la balanza&#13;
externa e interna, y menos favorables en lo que respecta al empleo. Sin&#13;
embargo, hacia el final de la decada, cuando la situaci6n se deterior6 y marc6&#13;
el comienzo de una tendencia desfavorable que dura hasta la fecha, empezaron a&#13;
quedar de manifiesto las fallas del sistema de adopci6n de decisiones y de la&#13;
estructura institucional. La situaci6n de la deuda empeor6 sostenidamente en&#13;
1981 y 1982, cuando el Gobierno contrajo grandes deudas para financiar la&#13;
balanza de pagos, y esto condujo a la actual situaci6n de casi crisis. Varias&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ix -&#13;
inversiones financiadas con recursos de fuentes externas durante los anios "bue-&#13;
nos" aparentemente no estan dando fruto, de modo que cabe poner en duda la&#13;
estrategia global en ese campo. El analisis que se presenta en este trabajo&#13;
sugiere que bajo cualquier hip6tesis razonablemente probable la Republica&#13;
Dominicana no podra lograr un crecimiento econ6mico per cApita aceptable durante&#13;
los pr6ximos diez afios si no efectuia grandes cambios de politica.&#13;
El pais debe avanzar gradualmente hacia un tipo de cambio unificado.&#13;
Las etapas de la unificaci6n del tipo de cambio son muy importantes. En lo que&#13;
respecta a las exportaciones, las manufacturas, el turismo y las exportaciones&#13;
no tradicionales deben traspasarse rApidamente al mercado paralelo, y la mayoria&#13;
de las demas exportaciones se deben transferir dentro de un plazo mas largo. En&#13;
lo que respecta a las importaciones, la mayoria de ellas --excepto las de petr6-&#13;
leo y alimentos esenciales-- se podria trasladar rapidamente y las excepciones&#13;
se podrian escalonar dentro de un periodo de cinco afios. Este escalonamiento&#13;
debe ir unido a modificaciones fiscales, para asegurar que en el peor de los&#13;
casos los ingresos netos del Gobierno no sufran con el cambio, e instituciona-&#13;
les, para que las exportaciones tengan un apoyo s6lido a todos los niveles. La&#13;
situaci6n del empleo requiere un importante cambio en la fijaci6n de los precios&#13;
de los factores y una reconsideraci6n de la estrategia de inversi6n. Por ejem-&#13;
plo, podria ser mas util tratar de lograr el equilibrio de los gastos entre los&#13;
de capital, por una parte, y los de administraci6n y mantenimiento, por la&#13;
otra. Cuando existen posibilidades de sustituci6n convenientes no hay que&#13;
importar bienes de capital a tipos de cambio preferenciales.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-x -&#13;
Probablemente estas iniciativas hagan poca diferencia, pero permiten&#13;
sentar las bases de una economia mas pr6spera y polifac6tica dentro de un plazo&#13;
mediano a largo.&#13;
En este trabajo se formula un marco analitico para examinar estas&#13;
distintas alternativas en materia de politica. Se decidi6 que la parte matema-&#13;
tica fuera relativamente clara, de modo que aunque se incorporen juicios&#13;
econ6micos las principales cuentas macroecon6micas sigan siendo coherentes.&#13;

La Republique dominicaine est un pays a economie ouverte et au&#13;
marche interieur relativement 6troit. Au cours des annees 70, gr&amp;ce aux&#13;
conditions favorables que ses principaux produits d'exportation (sucre et&#13;
minerais) ont trouve sur les march6s mondiaux, le pays a enregistr6 un&#13;
taux de croissance moyen du PNB de 6,3 % pour 1?ensemble de la d6cennie.&#13;
Toutefois, vers la fin de la d6cennie, plusieurs crises&#13;
d'origine externe, notamment la hausse des prix du p6trole, les&#13;
modifications des termes de 1'echange et l'augmentation des taux&#13;
d'int6r6t, ont cr6e pour ce pays de s6rieux problemes. Dans le passe, son&#13;
developpement economique s 'tait surtout appuy6 sur la substitution des&#13;
importations et peu d'efforts avaient et6 d6ployes pour developper les&#13;
exportations au-dela des produits primaires traditionnels. La situation&#13;
financiere du pays d6pendait dans une tres grande mesure des recettes&#13;
provenant du commerce exterieur et l'efficacite 6conomique des entreprises&#13;
publiques, presque toujours deficitaires, n'6tait pas un sujet de&#13;
pr6occupation prioritaire.&#13;
Au cours des ann6es 70, l16conomie mondiale 6tant tres active,&#13;
cette politique d'action a donne des r6sultats assez satisfaisants en&#13;
matiere de niveau des prix et de balance du commerce ext6rieur, avec des&#13;
r6sultats moins bons dans le domaine de L'emploi. Toutefois, quand la&#13;
situation a commenc6 a se d6t6riorer vers la fin de la d6cennie, ne&#13;
faisant que s'aggraver ces dernieres ann6es, les faiblesses sous-jacentes,&#13;
au niveau des prises de d6cision et de la structure institutionnelle, ont&#13;
commenc6 a apparaitre. La situation de la dette a progressivement empir6,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xii -&#13;
le Gouvernement faisant de lourds emprunts en 1981 et 1982 pour financer&#13;
le d6ficit de sa balance des paiements, ce qui a amene la situation&#13;
actuelle, proche de la crise. Plusieurs investissements financ6s par des&#13;
sources exterieures pendant les ann6es "fastes" ne semblent pas avoir&#13;
donn6 les r6sultats esp6r6s de sorte qu'une r6vision de la la strat6gie&#13;
globale s'impose. La pr6sente analyse indique que, dans aucune hypothese&#13;
raisonnable et probable que l'on puisse 6tablir a propos de l'evolution&#13;
future de la situation mondiale, la Republique dominicaine ne parviendra A&#13;
atteindre un taux de croissance 6conomique par habitant acceptable au&#13;
cours de la prochaine d6cennie sans une r6orientation profonde de sa&#13;
politique d'action.&#13;
I1 conviendrait que les dirigeants de ce pays adoptent un taux&#13;
de change unifie et, chose tres importante, le fassent progressivement.&#13;
Les exportations de biens manufactures ainsi que le tourisme et les&#13;
exportations non traditionnelles devraient, dans les meilleurs d6lais, se&#13;
voir appliquer le taux de change du marche parallele, la plupart des&#13;
autres produits d'exportation devant suivre A plus long terme. Pour la&#13;
plupart des importations, le taux de change en vigueur sur le march6&#13;
parallele devrait leur etre appliqu6 dans les meilleurs delais, A&#13;
l'exception du p6trole et des produits vivriers essentiels pour lesquels&#13;
la transition pourrait s'etaler sur une periode de cinq ans. Simultane-&#13;
ment, des modifications fiscales et institutionnelles devraient etre&#13;
adoptees, les premieres en vue d'assurer que les revenus publics nets ne&#13;
seront pas, au pire, affectes par le changement, les autres afin de soute-&#13;
nir v6ritablement les exportations A tous les niveaux. La situation de&#13;
l'emploi exige une modification importante de la fixation des prix des&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xiii -&#13;
facteurs, accompagnee d'une nouvelle strategie des investissements. Par&#13;
exemple, il serait peut-etre preferable d'essayer d'etablir un meilleur&#13;
equilibre entre les depenses d'equipement et les d6penses de gestion et&#13;
d'entretien. Dans tous les cas ou il existe des possibilites souhaitables&#13;
de substitution, les biens d'equipement ne devraient pas etre importes A&#13;
des taux preferentiels.&#13;
A court terme, de telles initiatives n'auront probablement que&#13;
des effets limites; toutefois, elles permettraient de jeter les bases&#13;
d'une economie plus diversifiee et plus active, A moyen et long termes.&#13;
Le present document offre un cadre analytique permettant&#13;
d'examiner ces diverses solutions en matiere de politique d'action. Les&#13;
chiffres et calculs ont ete deliberement simplifi6s pour permettre&#13;
d'incorporer une appreciation economique tout en assurant la compatibilite&#13;
des principaux comptes macroeconomiques.&#13;

THE MACRO-ECONOMIC SITUATION&#13;
1.0 Introduction&#13;
This paper analyzes the macro-economic situation in the&#13;
Dominican Republic. It falls in four principal sections. Recent events&#13;
are  first  reviewed.    In  particular   the  adjustment  to  the  shocks&#13;
experienced by the economy in the 1979-82 period.        The next section&#13;
discusses export prices and quantum forecasts and then proceeds to&#13;
review the present debt problem. In the following section a macro model&#13;
is developed to project a base case scenario. This is then complemented&#13;
by pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.    The final section discusses a&#13;
number of policy issues.&#13;
Under most scenarios given here the unemployment situation&#13;
deteriorates.    This will   require a major new initiative such as a&#13;
realignment of capital/wage costs because a reasonable growth rate alone&#13;
will not be sufficient.&#13;
2.0 External Economic Shocks and Policy Response&#13;
2.1 Nature of Shock&#13;
In recent years Dominican Republic has suffered from major&#13;
external shocks. These have been further exacerbated by the devastating&#13;
effect of the hurricane and the reconstruction needs in 1980.     Selected&#13;
indicators of the external shocks and the policy response are summarized&#13;
in Table 2.1.&#13;
Over the period 1979 to 1981 the adverse impact of these&#13;
yearly shocks is estimated at 8.8% of GNP. The shock is decomposed into&#13;
three components, terms of trade, export volume effects and interest&#13;

rate effects.    In 1979 and    1980 the main contributor was a sharp&#13;
deterioration in terms of trade when it accounted for 81 and 69%&#13;
respectively of the total shock in those years.      However in 1981 the&#13;
terms of trade change was highly favorable primarily due to a sharp&#13;
increase in world sugar prices. Export volume and interest rate effects&#13;
were  moderately   unfavorable  in  1979  and   1980 but were    strongly&#13;
unfavorable in 1981 when they more than offset the terms of trade gain&#13;
in that year.&#13;
2.2 Policy Response&#13;
Policy variables suggest that the government sought an even&#13;
keel policy for exchange rate but this began to deteriorate in 1982.&#13;
This is a little misleading, however, because the parallel market began&#13;
to play an increasingly important role after 1980.        The government&#13;
budget deficit began to grow in 1981 and this deterioration accelerated&#13;
in 1982.    On the positive side inflation rates were moderate while&#13;
significant attempts were made to increase domestic petroleum prices.&#13;
These rose from 55% of international prices in the period 1976-1978 to&#13;
over 100% by 1982.&#13;
The balance of payments effects of policy responses are given&#13;
under heading III in Table 2.1. One notes that the total effects sum up&#13;
to 100%.    For example in 1979 import substitution     (non-fuel) policy&#13;
response offset 51% of the balance of payments effect of the external&#13;
shock while the import effect accounted for a further 57.    Some measure&#13;
of import substitution was achieved by increasing domestic prices for&#13;
importables -- fuel in particular.    Under III.B in Table 2.1 one notes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
that the positive import substitution effort for fuel averaged 15% of&#13;
the  trend  (even keel   policy)  value for   the  1979-81  period.   The&#13;
performance on export promotion was minimal.    The principal effects of&#13;
the policy response was a slowing down of the economy and a sharp&#13;
increase  in  foreign  borrowing.    This  combination   of policies was&#13;
indicative of a rather weak domestic effort which was complicated by the&#13;
high political price required for any unpopular economic initiative.&#13;
This in turn laid the groundwork for the rather dismal economic&#13;
situation in 1983.    A continual sluggishness in the world economy and&#13;
higher   debt  repayment   obligations  currently   pose  very   difficult&#13;
problems. Perhaps even more serious is the fact that current policies&#13;
do not seem well poised to offer any relief in the next few years even&#13;
if  the global   economic outlook improves.     In the next section we&#13;
elaborate some of the perspectives.&#13;
3.0 Perspective: Economic Background&#13;
The external sector plays a major role in a small open economy&#13;
like the Dominican Republic.     Overall economic prospects are strongly&#13;
colored by the assumptions one makes on export and import prospects.&#13;
Price projections used in the study are given in Tables 3.3 and 3.4.&#13;
These are primarily based on the forecast provided by the Commodity&#13;
Division of the World Bank.&#13;
In order to evaluate the current situation a macro model was&#13;
developed.   The base year is 1980.   This has the advantage that data is&#13;
available for most economic variables and it allows a few years to tune&#13;
the model. The base year data set is discussed in Appendix A, while the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
model is described in Appendix B.    A set of assumptions were needed to&#13;
produce a base run.&#13;
Much of the analysis in this report takes as a reference a&#13;
base run.   The base run is discussed in Section 4.    The performance of&#13;
the economy is strongly affected by debt situation, external sector&#13;
prospects and domestic factor prices. Each of these are now discussed.&#13;
3.1 Debt&#13;
The total debt (medium and long-term) outstanding in 1983 is&#13;
estimated at US$ 2082 million. The distribution of debt outstanding and&#13;
disbursed as of December 31, 1982 indicates a balanced use of creditor&#13;
sources with 20.1% owed to private creditors, 21.5% to multilateral&#13;
institutions   and   58.4%  to   bilateral.     The  overall   percentage&#13;
distribution of total commitments by creditor sources for the period&#13;
1978-82 show a clear change of financial sources. The bilateral sources&#13;
increased to 74.1% by 1982 while no contracts were made with private&#13;
banks in the last two years.     This contraction in the use of private&#13;
sources also resulted in improvement in terms.       In 1982 the average&#13;
was: interest, 5.5%; maturity, 16.4%; and grace period, 4.4 years.&#13;
Renegotiation of Private Debt&#13;
Continued deterioration in the ability of Dominican Republic&#13;
to meet its obligations required renegotiation of the debt owed private&#13;
banks. While this is not yet finalized, it seems that a sum of US$ 660&#13;
million is involved. This is summarized in Table 3.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Table 3.1: RESCHEDULED DEBT&#13;

Financial institutions                        88.1&#13;
Non-guaranteed private and other             135.6&#13;
Note in particular that of the US$ 660 being renegotiated only&#13;
an estimated US$ 223.7 million is included in the US$ 2082 million&#13;
total.  In particular a sum of US$ 342.5 million for Cartas de Credito&#13;
were short-term debt (i.e. not included in the medium- and long-term&#13;
total) but because the payments were in arrears now become part of total&#13;
debt and are rescheduled.    It is further assumed that the CEA loan of&#13;
US$ 60.8 million is to be paid entirely in 1986 and carries an interest&#13;
rate of 12.81%.   The balance is rescheduled at 11% interest and will be&#13;
repaid in four equal payments beginning in 1985.&#13;
Thus in this analysis (model) the effect of rescheduling is&#13;
that all outstanding amortization on private guaranteed and non-&#13;
guaranteed debt is eliminated up to 1983. The sum total is treated as a&#13;
new commitment.   This requires new payments of principal and interest&#13;
but will not generate any new disbursements.&#13;
Thus the overall impact of the rescheduling is to provide some&#13;
reduction in debt service payments on the US$ 2082 million total&#13;
(because US$ 223.7 million of this is included in the rescheduling) for&#13;
1983 and 1984.  However by 1985 the rescheduling will result in a sharp&#13;
increase in debt service payments as amortization and interest on the&#13;
US$ 660 million is added to the overall burden.&#13;

3.2 External Sector&#13;
o    Prices.  Export and import prices are exogenous as provided by&#13;
the World Bank Commodity Division. The indices for current and constant&#13;
export prices are given in Tables 3.3 and 3.4.     The ratio between the&#13;
two is the international price index. The sugar price is the average of&#13;
the world free market price forecast and the U.S. quota price.&#13;
Dominican Republic is expected to sell half of its output under the&#13;
quota arrangement.    The U.S. quota price is projected to remain at&#13;
US$400 per ton in 1983 prices. Thus the average sugar price obtained by&#13;
Dominican Republic for its exports is projected to rise from US$300 per&#13;
ton in 1983 to US$621 in 1990 in current dollars.&#13;
The price prospects are developed by the commodities and&#13;
export projections division at the World Bank. 1/ The forecasts do seek&#13;
to incorporate commodity specific prospects for demand, supply and trade&#13;
and have underlying macro-economic assumptions for the global economy.&#13;
Thus the overall real GDP growth for the world economy is taken at 3.9%&#13;
p.a. between 1983 and 1990 for the forecasts used in this analysis.&#13;
o    Export Quantum Prospects.   The export quantum projections used&#13;
in this study are summarized in Table 3.5.     There are three principal&#13;
scenarios considered, base, optimistic and pessimistic.     For all three&#13;
the price projections used are those developed by the commodity&#13;
division. The differences in the projections arise from the assumptions&#13;
on the quantum indices. The prospects for exports of agricultural&#13;

B means projections given in Tables 3.3 and 3.4.&#13;
commodities are discussed in detail by Franklin.     For the base case no&#13;
volume growth is projected for sugar and cocoa; the former principally&#13;
because global forecasts are pessimistic 1/ and Dominican Republic&#13;
already enjoys the largest share of the U.S. import quota at 17.5% --&#13;
the latter because 1983 exports are already substantially above trend.&#13;
The base run forecast for coffee at 6% is largely influenced by recent&#13;
improvements in investments in that sector.       Tobacco has also shown&#13;
significant improvement partially due to increased demand in free zone&#13;
operations. The optimistic scenario sets sugar quantity growth forecast&#13;
1/   Ending stocks for 1982/83 are estimated at 37 million tons and for&#13;
1983/84 are expected to remain well above normal -- about 24&#13;
million tons.   Substitute sweeteners continue to make inroads into&#13;
the sugar marked in the U.S.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 1I -&#13;
at  2%.    This would   be  predicated  on favorable   production  in the&#13;
Dominican Republic together with problems in other major producing areas&#13;
-- such as the recent dry weather experienced in Australia, Indonesia,&#13;
Mexico, Philippines, Fiji, South Africa and Thailand or the untimely&#13;
rains in Cuba.    For the optimistic scenario coffee and tobacco growth&#13;
rates are projected at 12 and 10% p.a. respectively.&#13;
For mineral commodity exports all three scenarios assume&#13;
quantum outputs to remain at 1983 levels for ferronickel, bauxite and&#13;
gold. This is predicated on no new investment coming on line within the&#13;
analysis period which in turn does not appear unreasonable given current&#13;
global situation for demand,    stocks, and capacity utilization.      For&#13;
manufactures the base run projects annual growth rate of 5%. This value&#13;
reflects a compromise between the current (1983) depressed state of&#13;
manufactures export and the poor policy climate.        The former leaves&#13;
plenty of room for expansion while the latter exerts a restraining&#13;
influence.   The optimistic forecast of 10% annual growth is based on a&#13;
more bouyant global economy combined with a more sympathetic domestic&#13;
policy environment.&#13;
Non-factor service includes tourism.     This sector has shown&#13;
great  promise  in  recent  years.     Compared  to  its  competitors  the&#13;
Dominican Republic is still small but as it grows larger it will become&#13;
increasingly difficult to maintain strong growth rates.      For the base&#13;
case a growth rate of 5% is chosen while the optimistic scenario is set&#13;
at 10%.&#13;

3.3 Domestic Factor Prices&#13;
In the model domestic factor prices are assumed to adjust in&#13;
step with external inflation rates.     This has strong implications for&#13;
employment. Changes in exchange rate policy towards free market levels&#13;
would raise the relative cost of imported capital and intermediate&#13;
inputs. In certain sectors this would increase employment -- typically&#13;
higher pesticide costs in agriculture would result in more labor for&#13;
weeding.    However  the overall impact on employment     depends on the&#13;
elasticity of substitution between factors. There is some evidence that&#13;
factor input costs could be reduced in certain sectors by improved&#13;
productivity.   However to do this requires a socio-political commitment&#13;
that is not currently evident.     The model does not currently include&#13;
different types of labor which could be useful in analyzing labor&#13;
markets.     However  it  does   produce  rather  crude  projections   for&#13;
employment under different scenarios.    These are discussed in the next&#13;
section.&#13;
4.0 Economic Projections&#13;
In this section we develop a set of three economic projections&#13;
for the economy.   These are termed base run, optimistic and pessimistic&#13;
and provide a framework for discussing various policy options for the&#13;
Dominican Republic.    The approach is first to develop a unified data&#13;
base. This is done as a social accounting structure for 1980. A model&#13;
is then developed to incorporate most of the important variables and the&#13;
model is tuned using available data for 1981, 1982, and 1983. Finally a&#13;
set of projections are developed under the assumptions largely described&#13;
in the previous section.&#13;
&#13;

4.1 Social Accounting Structure - 1980&#13;
The basic data set used in this analysis is based on the&#13;
principal accounts for 1980.       It is then developed    into a social&#13;
accounting matrix (SAM) for 1980. The year 1980 was chosen for a number&#13;
of reasons.     The various   statistics  for that year are    relatively&#13;
reliable and yet it is not so far back that the general economic&#13;
structure has changed too much by 1983.     It also affords a few years,&#13;
1981-1983 to tune the model.&#13;
The layout of the SAM required a number of decisions. It was&#13;
deemed necessary to produce a working model in about 4 to 6 weeks.     It&#13;
was required to provide a set of basic projections amenable to&#13;
investigation for a number of policies.     These included the impact of&#13;
different export earning scenarios, changes in exchange rate, and the&#13;
interaction of alternate government budgets on employment.     Inevitably&#13;
there was a trade-off between the complexity needed to analyze a variety&#13;
of policies and the time available.      The structure chosen allows for&#13;
flexibility so that the model may be enriched as desired and yet it&#13;
succeeds in producing the basic information.&#13;
The basic SAM structure is shown in Table 4.1.      It has the&#13;
following principal features.&#13;
4 sectors            -  agriculture, manufacturing,&#13;
construction, and other (principally&#13;
services)&#13;
2 institutions       -  government (central), private&#13;
(includes all other)&#13;
3 capital accounts   -   private, government and depreciation&#13;
2 financial accounts - domestic, foteign&#13;

In Appendix A Tables A.2 to A.7 give the main accounts for&#13;
private, government, investment and external.&#13;
The   social  accounting   structure   provides  a   consistent&#13;
framework for the important economic accounting identities. For example&#13;
the GDP at market prices (in million RD pesos) is given by&#13;
GDPMP=         C    +         I    +      E            -M&#13;

Similarly most of the other identities may be obtained from&#13;
the structure.&#13;
4.2 Model of Economy&#13;
A simplified model of the economy was next developed.     It is&#13;
shown schematically in Table 4.2 and it works along these lines.&#13;
Consumption is determined endogenously.    This combines with exogenously&#13;
determined investment, exports and government consumption to provide&#13;
final demand.   Subject to technological assumptions this provides gross&#13;
production estimates. Domestic prices are determined by exogenously set&#13;
export, import and factor prices. The level of value added gives income&#13;
and labor demand estimates.     Total savings, S, has these components,&#13;
private, government (central) and foreign.      The model iterates until&#13;
this equals the level of investment I. Then the model computes the&#13;

current account, updates the debt module and estimates the additional&#13;
capital flows needed.&#13;
Finally capital stock and labor supply is adjusted and the&#13;
models proceeds to the next year.     Each year the shortfall in external&#13;
borrowing is computed to fill the gap and the debt situation is updated.&#13;
4.3 Base Run&#13;
The outcome for the base run is summarized in Table 4.3.&#13;
Overall GDP is projected to rise by 0.3% in 1984 and after a gain of&#13;
1.5% in 1985 to rise towards annual growth rates of 3.4% towards the end&#13;
of the decade.   For the external sector the current account deficit for&#13;
1983 is estimated at 232.3 million and rises to 527.3 million by 1990.&#13;
This is discussed in more detail in Section 5 under policy issue. This&#13;
in turn would result in debt outstanding (medium and long term) going&#13;
from US$2.0 billion to close to US$4.2 billion.&#13;
On the domestic front there would be a steady improvement in&#13;
government (central) finances but the unemployment situation would&#13;
deteriorate steadily until an anticipated 32.4% of the labor force would&#13;
be unemployed by 1990.&#13;
4.4 Optimistic Run&#13;
The optimistic run assumes annual real growth rates for&#13;
exports of sugar, manufactures and non-factor service of 2%, 10% and 10%&#13;
respectively from 1983 to 1990 while the price forecasts used in the&#13;
base run are retained.    The results are given in Table 4.4.     Here the&#13;
growth would level off at close to 6.0% by 1990.     In this instance the&#13;
current account balance would be about US$222 million by 1990 while the&#13;

total debt outstanding would be US$3.2 billion at that time.          The&#13;
government (central) finances are projected to show a surplus of close&#13;
to US$537 million by 1990.     Unemployment levels while high would show&#13;
signs of moderating at that time.&#13;
Capacity utilization would show substantial improvement but&#13;
the foreign share in that stock at 0.18 would be below the historic&#13;
figure of close to 0.24.&#13;
4.5  Pessimistic Run&#13;
The pessimistic run projects zero real growth for all&#13;
exports.  The results are summarized in Table 4.5.&#13;
It suggests a disastrous growth rate of -1.6% for 1984&#13;
followed by further negative growth in 1985 while annual growth rates&#13;
would tend to stabilize around 1.7% by 1990.       This would be further&#13;
compounded by a current account deficit in the neighbourhood of US$740&#13;
billion by 1990 and total debt outstanding in excess of US$4.9 billion&#13;
at that time. Unemployment levels would reach 37% and continued rising&#13;
(certainly a rather dismal prospect).      One can surmise that such a&#13;
disastrous situation would lead to widespread dissatisfaction.&#13;
4.6 Conclusion&#13;
The three scenarios outlined here provide some guidance on the&#13;
overall economic situation if no major policy initiatives are&#13;
undertaken. The pessimistic scenario seems unacceptable. The base run&#13;
suggests that the balance of payment deficits and concomittant borrowing&#13;
needs would not be sustainable under the current borrowing climate. The&#13;
optimistic run requires a sustained improvement in export performance.&#13;

Even then unemployment levels would remain high. There is serious doubt&#13;
that the needed borrowing would be forthcoming.         If there were an&#13;
unprecedented sustained surge in demand for Dominican Republic exports&#13;
such as for sugar then the economy would no doubt pick up and employment&#13;
would fall.   However under any reasonably likely external scenario the&#13;
prospects for a bouyant economy are not too good.         This then leads&#13;
naturally to the question of what can be done to improve the&#13;
situation. This is the subject of the next section.&#13;
5.0 Policy Issues&#13;
In this section a number of policy issues are discussed.      To&#13;
facilitate the exposition it is convenient to discuss the issues under&#13;
three broad categories:     external balance, domestic balance and then&#13;
employment and prices.    Inevitably these are closely inter-related and&#13;
policy instruments tend to affect all three in varying degrees. In the&#13;
previous section the analysis chose different external scenarios but did&#13;
not introduce any major structural changes.     From this it appears that&#13;
without significant new initiatives the Dominican Republic economy will&#13;
not be able to address major problem areas in balance of payments,&#13;
employment, price stability.    The recent renegotiation of private debt&#13;
does give a little breathing space to introduce such measures but future&#13;
borrowing should seek to move overall economic management towards more&#13;
desirable medium and long-term goals.&#13;
5.1 External Balance&#13;
The medium and long-term debt outstanding in 1983 is close to&#13;
US$ 2.0 billion. This is further augmented by US$342.5 million arising&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
from arrears or payments for cartas de cr4dito. The implication of the&#13;
renegotiation is that amortization payments on US$660 million of the&#13;
total debt will not     be made  in 1983.    Most of this sum is being&#13;
rescheduled at 11% interest and will be repaid in four equal payments&#13;
beginning in 1985.    Thus it is essential that the breathing space even&#13;
though limited be used effectively to prepare for the heavier repayment&#13;
burden in coming years.&#13;
In Table 5.1 the capital account situation is summarized.     In&#13;
Section I best estimates are given for expected net flows. In 1984 for&#13;
instance, from official sources net official capital flows are estimated&#13;
at US$ 49 million (disbursements are estimated at US$ 191 million with&#13;
amortization payments at US$ 142 million).    The "other" category at US$&#13;
22.6 million includes disbursements on grants at US$ 6.1 million and net&#13;
direct foreign investment at US$ 16.5 million. These expected net flows&#13;
are projected to reach US$ 194.9 million by 1990.     One could argue that&#13;
the figure is on the low side but it is based on best information&#13;
currently available.&#13;
In Section II the base case situation is summarized.        Note&#13;
that in 1983 the current account balance is estimated at US$ -282.3&#13;
million after adjusting by the expected net flows figure of US$ 234.6&#13;
million.    A  further US$   47.7 million is needed.      This  is termed&#13;
GAPFIL.   The terms for financing GAPFIL are three years maturity with&#13;
one year grace at interest rate of 9.3%.        Thus as current balances&#13;
continue their financing creates an ever increasing burden.       Note for&#13;
instance the rapid shortening in the average maturity.     In the base run&#13;
the current account deficit for 1990 is estimated at US$ -527.3 million&#13;
but the GAPFIL requirement is US$ 991.3 million.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
The pessimistic scenario summarized in Section IV is even more&#13;
untenable.   When one moves to the optimistic scenario the situation is&#13;
slightly better but GAPFIL requirements reach US$ 536.7 million by 1990.&#13;
In short the three scenarios all presage major problems for&#13;
debt management.    One can reflect on how the situation became so bad.&#13;
There are many factors; failure to adopt the correct policies, laxity in&#13;
paying bills; and inability to utilize the financing available under the&#13;
San Jose accord. During 1982 commitments at US$ 406.1 million showed an&#13;
increase of 36% over 1981.    Of these commitments over 40% were credits&#13;
for balance of payments support.&#13;
Similarly one may argue that the expected net flows in this&#13;
analysis should be greater.     To reflect the international price index&#13;
one could speculate on US$ 300 to 400 million (net) being available by&#13;
1990.   One could also argue that the terms for GAPFIL should be less&#13;
harsh. Some modifications in the assumptions could certainly project a&#13;
slightly better situation but in the end it is evident that major new&#13;
initiatives are needed to set the economy on a viable medium- to long-&#13;
term course.&#13;
The recent economic history of Dominican Republic suggests&#13;
that overall policy has had a strong import substitution bias with only&#13;
mild attempts at expansion and diversification of exports. In principal&#13;
the level of foreign exchange availability per se has not been a major&#13;
bottleneck. Rather the problem has been the ineffective use of foreign&#13;
exchange - the failure to direct it towards productive investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5.2 Changes in Exchange Rate&#13;
The section on exports suggests a number of sectors which&#13;
would benefit from an enlightened export policy -- these are primarily&#13;
for manufactured goods, non-factor service and certain non-traditional&#13;
agriculture   commodities.    Unfortunately   it  does  not   appear  that&#13;
Dominican Republic's principal exports, sugar, coffee, and minerals&#13;
would increase much in physical terms from a peso devaluation or other&#13;
export incentives. 1/&#13;
On the import side the categories enjoying more favorable&#13;
exchange rates are food, petroleum and intermediate goods and to a&#13;
lesser extent other consumer goods and capital goods.       The estimated&#13;
exchange rates by sectors are given in Table 5.2.&#13;
One may surmise the effect of a unified market clearing&#13;
exchange rate.    In the short term (two to three years) the impact on&#13;
most export categories would be minimal.     In the medium term one could&#13;
expect increases for manufactures and non-traditional agriculture&#13;
exports.    However  to capitalize on these gains     any change   in the&#13;
exchange rate would need to be accompanied by a comprehensive pro-export&#13;
commercial policy, i.e., a freeing up of prohibitions on various product&#13;
categories and in general removal of most exchange controls.&#13;
On the import side one might expect a more direct impact. In&#13;
the short term there would be a sharp rise in the cost of living.       In&#13;
urban areas, in particular, food prices would rise but this would be&#13;
1/   There are other arguments which support a devaluation cum windfall&#13;
tax levy -- see Selowsky.&#13;

partially offset by increased domestic production.     Increased costs for&#13;
other consumer goods import such as automobiles should mainly impact&#13;
higher income groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Higher prices for petroleum, intermediate and capital goods&#13;
import, would result in increased domestic production costs.       In the&#13;
medium-term one might expect improved opportunities for those producing&#13;
food for the domestic market.     For industry such significant changes&#13;
would  lead  to restructuring.     Higher  capital  costs  could  lead  to&#13;
increased employment opportunities in some areas.&#13;
A cursory analysis of the impact of a unified exchange rate&#13;
policy suggests that in the short term the current balance would most&#13;
likely deteriorate. Thus a more pragmatic approach might be to announce&#13;
a phased devaluation over say a five year period to allow for&#13;
adjustments.    In particular the exchange rate for most of the major&#13;
commodity exports might be moved rather slowly while those with better&#13;
prospects would enjoy a more favorable rate.      On the import side the&#13;
rate for other consumer goods and food might be adjusted relatively&#13;
quickly.&#13;
During the transition period viable export oriented ventures&#13;
would be gradually allowed to retain higher shares of export earning.&#13;
This could help alleviate the practice of underinvoicing.     This implies&#13;
a major overhaul of the foreign exchange system. While one may find it&#13;
politically impalatable to approach devaluation in such a de jure manner&#13;
it implies that one should adopt one means or another to achieve it de&#13;
facto.   The alternative is promulgation of mis-allocation of resources&#13;
and continuation of many of the abuses currently endemic. These include&#13;
overinvoicing on exports, underinvoicing and representation on imports&#13;
to avoid import levies and abuse of foreign exchange privileges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5.3 Domestic Balance&#13;
The base case scenario suggests that the central government&#13;
accounts will move into surplus in the near future.     Central Government&#13;
expenditure is projected to rise from DR$800 million in 1983 to DR$1352&#13;
million by 1990.    This is in line with providing a steady increase in&#13;
public expenditures particularly in the social sectors.       It will also&#13;
contribute to a tolerable level of effective demand.         Revenues are&#13;
projected to increase from DR$779.6 million in 1983 to DR$1645.7 million&#13;
by 1990. Revenue from exports and imports and direct taxes are expected&#13;
to rise slightly.     The main contributing factor is projected in the&#13;
"other" category.    The principal component here is expected in the&#13;
increase in receipts from value added taxes.     It is essential that the&#13;
administration of this taxation be improved and various "leakages" and&#13;
special exemptions be minimized.&#13;
If a unified exchange rate policy is pursued it is essential&#13;
that government revenues on exports of sugar and minerals be sustained&#13;
by alternate approaches such as tariffs.    Import trade receipts suggest&#13;
that average rates fall well below posted ranges.        It might be more&#13;
effective to have a broad based tax on all imports but at a considerably&#13;
lower rate in the region of 20%.    An exception could be lower rates for&#13;
various basic foodstuff (in the short term) and higher rates for various&#13;
consumer goods.&#13;
There is a major problem for various public operations outside&#13;
the central government.    This is discussed in detail in the chapter on&#13;
public enterprises. Proposed changes in exchange rate and import policy&#13;
imply a major change in INESPRE.     The electricity authority is a major&#13;

factor  in any   development  strategy.   Here  it seems   that after an&#13;
extended period characterized by poor performance major new initiatives&#13;
are called for.   In particular the productivity of investment needs to&#13;
be  improved.     This  involves   greater  emphasis  on  management   and&#13;
maintenance.    Similarly one may review each of the public services.&#13;
However most of these observations have been made in one form or another&#13;
in a number of previous reports so one much reach beyond conventional&#13;
economic analysis to understand why positive changes have been so&#13;
lacking.&#13;
5.4 Employment and Prices&#13;
Historically employment has been one of the more intractable&#13;
problems faced by policymakers in the Dominican Republic.     Their record&#13;
in this respect is not a happy one.      While it always is difficult to&#13;
define unemployment in a country such as Dominican Republic the general&#13;
estimates  tend to assess    it at about   20%.  1/   In this particular&#13;
analysis information on population, labor force and unemployment was&#13;
collected from various sources (see references) in an attempt to&#13;
estimate  employment   structures  and  sectoral  elasticities.    Because&#13;
appropriate employment data are not readily available, estimates were&#13;
made by (1) obtaining labor force estimates for 1960, 1970 and 1980; (2)&#13;
applying gross unemployment rates to these estimates; and (3)&#13;
distributing the resulting employment figures by sectors under the&#13;
1/   For example in the labor force survey of urban areas in June 1980&#13;
unemployed were defined as those who had not worked during the week&#13;
in question but were actively seeking employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
assumption that the employed were distributed in the same manner as the&#13;
labor force.   The analysis did not adequately take into consideration a&#13;
number of relevant factors affecting the labor market, such as Haitian&#13;
laborers who do much of the cane cutting, female participation, and the&#13;
large but poorly understood informal sector.&#13;
A final set of estimates are given in Table 5.3. The historic&#13;
figures are deemed to be reasonable based on comparisons with other&#13;
sources,  while   the   projections  are   derived  from   the  base  case&#13;
scenario.   Certainly one may agrue about the historic numbers used --&#13;
that perhaps 20% is too high -- that the definition of unemployment&#13;
fails to take into account many considerations about the informal&#13;
sector. But in the end it seems evident that the unemployment situation&#13;
needs much closer attention.     It also appears that without major new&#13;
policy initiatives there can be little improvement under any reasonable&#13;
plausible set of assumptions about the external situation.&#13;
The problem is quite difficult given the historic pattern of&#13;
development pursued by the Dominican Republic.    However there are a few&#13;
clues.   The elasticity of employment with respect to value added by&#13;
sector is also given in Table 5.1.       The value for agriculture seems&#13;
reasonable perhaps even a little high -- however for construction and&#13;
service sectors the value are low.       Similarly, values estimated for&#13;
capacity utilization have been low. This suggests that capital has not&#13;
been employed as effectively as possible.     Thus more emphasis might be&#13;
placed  on   more    labor   intensive  aspects  of   production  such  as&#13;
maintenance and    running costs    --   this   seems to be the case for&#13;
electricity and water supply. Another reason that capital has been&#13;

somewhat favored is the beneficial exchange rates given capital goods.&#13;
Finally one must look at various rigidities in the system to provide an&#13;
enabling environment for employment.    In agriculture improved access to&#13;
land and credit would inevitably increase employment opportunities.&#13;
Similarly expanded markets through exports would be beneficial.      This&#13;
latter would require more analysis given the lack of institutional&#13;
support for such activities.&#13;
However the good location, excellent land resources and&#13;
potentially high quality labor force should respond quite well once the&#13;
appropriate policies are in place.     This requires a genuine political&#13;
commitment.      In the current   situation there are few alternatives&#13;
available unless the Dominican Republic receives substantial amounts of&#13;
concessionary aid.     If the Government does not wish to pursue these&#13;
measures then one alternative would be to resort to the printing&#13;
presses.    This would buy some short term relief but at a heavy cost.&#13;
The parallel market rate would rise sharply and it would simply postpone&#13;
the need to come to grips with an even more intractible situation.&#13;

            Macroeconomic policy alternatives in the
            Dominican Republic : an analytical framework
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Dominican Republic is an open economy
            with a relatively small domestic market. Towards the end of
            the 1970s, a number of external shocks in oil prices, terms
            of trade, and higher interest rates presented major
            problems. This resulted in a surfacing of weakness in policy
            making and institutional structure that had not been
            apparent previously. The debt situation steadily
            deteriorated as the government borrowed heavily for balance
            of payments support in 1981 and 1982 leading to the current
            near crisis situation. The analysis in this paper suggests
            that under any reasonably likely external scenario Dominican
            Republic will be unable to achieve an acceptable per capita
            economic growth without major policy shifts. Policy
            alternatives include: (i) a move towards a unified exchange
            rate; (ii) fiscal and institutional changes; and (iii) a
            major shift in factor pricing together with a rethinking of
            investment strategy. These policy initiatives should lay the
            base for a more buoyant and versatile economy over the
            medium-to-long term. This paper develops an analytical
            framework to examine these various policy alternatives.
