        The World Bank Institute Evaluation Group (WBIEG) managed an independent&#13;
review of the Staff Learning Framework (SLF) during FY05 at the request of the Bank's&#13;
Chief Learning Officer (CLO). This evaluation report was prepared for the Knowledge&#13;
and Learning Board by consultant Dawn Roberts, principal author. Toni Hodges&#13;
contributed to the chapter on benchmarking.&#13;
&#13;
        Reviewing the history and current organization of staff learning at the Bank&#13;
represents an ambitious undertaking, and the author gratefully acknowledges the&#13;
guidance and support provided by Maurya West-Meiers, who served as task team leader.&#13;
She worked tirelessly to facilitate requests for data, locate documents, and identify&#13;
additional resources for missing information. In addition, the report benefited from input&#13;
and comments provided by the former, acting, and current managers of WBIEG:&#13;
Marlaine Lockheed, Nidhi Khattri, and Rich Tobin.&#13;
&#13;
        The author also gratefully acknowledges the members of the working committee,&#13;
who reviewed multiple drafts and provided thoughtful comments. These individuals&#13;
include Gail Davenport, Don MacDonald, Marsha Olive, Elaine Patterson, and Najma&#13;
Siddiqi.&#13;
&#13;
        Current and former members of the Knowledge and Learning Board and other key&#13;
learning stakeholders generously compiled materials about learning initiatives, combed&#13;
through archival documents, and offered candid reflections on their experiences. The&#13;
CLO, Phyllis Pomerantz, and her staff demonstrated their commitment to this review by&#13;
setting aside time for multiple interviews, responding to requests for information, and&#13;
explaining processes and issues related to staff learning data.&#13;
&#13;
        Finally, many others in WBIEG contributed to this report by explaining data&#13;
systems and discussing evaluations in progress. Diana Arango shared her knowledge of&#13;
staff learning and helped to identify key informants and resources. Daisuke Kakegawa&#13;
exhibited resourcefulness and persistence in scheduling the interviews, reviewing data&#13;
from the Learning Catalog, and assisting with graphics in the report. Humberto Diaz&#13;
contributed to document production.&#13;
&#13;
        WBIEG evaluates learning by Bank staff for the Knowledge and Learning Board&#13;
and activities of the World Bank Institute (WBI). The Institute supports the World Bank's&#13;
learning and knowledge agenda by providing learning programs and policy services in&#13;
the areas of governance, knowledge for development, human development, environment&#13;
and sustainable development, poverty reduction and economic management, and finance&#13;
and private sector development. The findings, interpretations, and conclusions expressed&#13;
in WBI Evaluation Studies are entirely those of the author and do not necessarily&#13;

                          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
        The World Bank Group adopted a new Staff Learning Framework (SLF) in late&#13;
FY01 to align learning with core business needs. At the request of the Bank's Chief&#13;
Learning Officer (CLO), the World Bank Institute Evaluation Group (WBIEG) managed&#13;
this independent review of the SLF to assess whether the new system has led to&#13;
improvements in the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of staff learning in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
  THE STAFF LEARNING FRAMEWORK: OBJECTIVES, ORGANIZATION, AND PROCESSES&#13;
&#13;
        The SLF promotes learning that is demand driven, aligned with business results,&#13;
supported through new forms of pedagogy, and systematically monitored and evaluated.&#13;
The SLF's objectives do not specify measurable targets but instead set priorities for&#13;
developing staff capacity and seek to promote a culture where learning is integral to the&#13;
Bank's business. The first four years of the SLF have focused on major organizational&#13;
and systemic changes.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Organization. The CLO oversees the SLF and chairs the Knowledge and&#13;
            Learning Board (KLB), which has representatives from the Bank's regions,&#13;
            networks, and other key learning providers. Strategic Learning Centers&#13;
            (SLCs) focus on priority content areas. Regions have a formal role in&#13;
            funding regionwide and country-specific learning events. A Learning&#13;
            Support Group provides support on instructional design and quality, and IEG&#13;
            monitors quality, identifies results, and provides formative feedback to&#13;
            improve design and delivery.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Resource Management. Learning funds are no longer embedded in the&#13;
            budgets of learning suppliers but are instead consolidated under the KLB.&#13;
            The CLO, in consultation with the KLB, recommends the Bank's budget&#13;
            allocation for staff learning to SFRRM. Internal fees for Bank-sponsored&#13;
            learning events have been eliminated to reduce transaction costs and to&#13;
            encourage staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Administrative Systems and Processes. The SLF is configured to improve the&#13;
            overall accountability for staff learning in the Bank. It has developed&#13;
            centralized functions to track learning activities and participation, to identify&#13;
            outcomes, and to use formative information to guide improvements. Key&#13;
            efforts to improve data quality and to link staff with appropriate learning&#13;
            opportunities have included revamping the Learning Catalog, creating a&#13;
            database for staff learning in Business Warehouse (BW), and designing a&#13;
            new learning management system (LMS).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             ix&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        The new organization and interrelated set of processes that have evolved now&#13;
serve key functions in the new framework, monitoring quality and assessing impact to&#13;
inform and improve the design and delivery of learning activities.&#13;
&#13;
                     RESULTS OF THE STAFF LEARNING FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
        The experience in achieving the SLF's objectives has been mixed. Progress can&#13;
be identified for providing high quality content in priority areas, clarifying accountability,&#13;
devolving decisionmaking for a demand driven structure, and creating a culture that&#13;
values learning. Little progress can be measured for changes in pedagogy and meeting&#13;
the specific needs of learners. Difficulties exist in assessing progress because of the lack&#13;
of pre-SLF data and measures and the lack of specific indicators against which to gauge&#13;
success. Notable findings of this review include:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Learning Objectives. The SLF espouses a shift away from focusing only on&#13;
             technical skills towards building capacity to create results. Learning plans&#13;
             link activities to work programs. WBIEG evaluations show that some&#13;
             participants use what they learned in their jobs, and three programs have&#13;
             resulted in operational impact in terms of better compliance to regulations,&#13;
             improved products, and higher quality assurance ratings. Not all types of&#13;
             activities have been evaluated.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Content Focus. New staff learning initiatives are in place to develop&#13;
             behavioral, integrative, operational, and managerial skills. Evaluation results&#13;
             are used to inform improvements.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Learner Focus. Administrative data are insufficient to assess whether the&#13;
             focus of learning programs has shifted away from headquarters staff. There&#13;
             have not been significant increases in the participation of country office staff&#13;
             and in the percentage of joint client/staff activities.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Pedagogy. No recorded, significant increases have occurred in the use of&#13;
             new forms of pedagogy as a percentage of all learning activities; however,&#13;
             new initiatives such as the Trust Fund Learning and Accreditation Program&#13;
             (TLAP) and the use of e-learning have modeled effective practices.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Structure. A new organization is now in place. This new structure was&#13;
            designed to increase accountability, with SLCs responsible for priority areas&#13;
            and IEG responsible for monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Culture. Interviews and staff surveys indicate that learning is becoming more&#13;
             valued within the Bank's culture now than it was during previous&#13;
             arrangements for staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
        This review identified few results of the SLF, perhaps because many of the early&#13;
efforts under the framework have focused on developing and refining administrative&#13;
systems and designing or piloting new initiatives. Results from the SLF are now&#13;
beginning to accrue, and further evaluations can provide evidence on progress towards&#13;
specific objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              x&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                       BENCHMARKING&#13;
&#13;
        The Bank is ahead of benchmarks for staff learning in terms of organization,&#13;
leadership, and evaluation, as determined through a literature review and interviews with&#13;
six large decentralized organizations. The Bank is comparable to benchmark&#13;
organizations for the alignment of staff learning with business needs, learning targets, the&#13;
process for budget allocations to staff learning, average expenditures, and implementation&#13;
of a LMS. The Bank is below the benchmark for the use of technology in learning.&#13;
&#13;
                          CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
        The SLF provides for central decisionmaking and monitoring at the Bank while&#13;
being responsive to the decentralized nature of the Bank's business. Centralized&#13;
functions such as administrative data systems and evaluation services support a cycle of&#13;
improvement to inform learning design and delivery. This review highlights key&#13;
accomplishments of the SLF but also identifies weaknesses and offers recommendations&#13;
to strengthen staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Governance.&#13;
&#13;
              o     The KLB is accountable for the success of the new framework, but&#13;
                    what constitutes successful staff learning has not been clearly defined.&#13;
                    The SLF's objectives reflect priorities rather than measurable targets.&#13;
                    Concrete objectives with associated indicators to measure success&#13;
                    should drive policies and plans for staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
              o     Confusion exists about how the Board sets learning policy. The&#13;
                    rationale for decisionmaking authority should link to concrete&#13;
                    objectives for staff learning, with a clear rationale for why Board&#13;
                    members receive only one vote regardless of the number of staff they&#13;
                    represent and why some vice presidential units (VPUs) have only&#13;
                    observer status.&#13;
&#13;
              o     Board members express confusion about their roles and concern about&#13;
                    the Board's ability to function effectively given its size and&#13;
                    composition. In some cases, competing interests lead to conflict&#13;
                    during Board meetings. Board dynamics are likely to be improved by&#13;
                    creating opportunities to honor members' areas of expertise, assigning&#13;
                    members more control of the Board's agendas, and using&#13;
                    subcommittees to address crosscutting institutional issues.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Resource Management.&#13;
&#13;
              o     Board members also express confusion about how resources for staff&#13;
                    learning are distributed among VPUs. A clear formula and process&#13;
                    should be established to allocate funds for staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
              o     A formal process has been established for VPUs to develop learning&#13;
                    plans linked to their work plans, but these learning plans are not&#13;
                    always based on an effective assessment of staff needs. A repository&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               xi&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        of tools and methods to determine staff needs should be available to&#13;
        VPUs, so that they can better identify the knowledge, skills, and&#13;
        behaviors that staff need to achieve business results. In addition,&#13;
        VPUs need information on outcomes and impacts to improve learning&#13;
        design and delivery, but some VPUs have not had any programs&#13;
        evaluated. More information about learning needs of staff and&#13;
        operational impact is needed to improve the alignment of learning&#13;
        activities with business results.&#13;
&#13;
Â· Learning Design and Delivery.&#13;
&#13;
   o    The quality of learning activities improved from FY03 to FY04 and&#13;
        has been maintained through FY05. However, despite the fact that the&#13;
        SLF has promoted the design and delivery of learning activities most&#13;
        appropriate for working adults, administrative data do not provide&#13;
        evidence of significant changes since FY03 in the proportion of&#13;
        activities delivered through new forms of pedagogy. Reliable&#13;
        administrative data are critical both for guiding staff participation and&#13;
        for tracking results. The KLB should monitor the LMS and ensure&#13;
        that it leads to improved data quality.&#13;
&#13;
   o    As the SLF matures, an increasing number of initiatives are launched&#13;
        or attempted, and systematic evaluation is yielding more information&#13;
        on results. A clearinghouse could offer useful direction to learning&#13;
        providers and other stakeholders on lessons learned. LSG and WBIEG&#13;
        could collaborate to develop this clearinghouse so that lessons gained&#13;
        from evaluation can be applied by learning providers.&#13;
&#13;
   o    Stakeholders identified LSG as a useful resource for information on&#13;
        learning tools and technologies and hands-on support for designing&#13;
        curricula. The KLB should clarify the process for enlisting assistance&#13;
        from LSG, so learning providers understand when to draw on this&#13;
        resource.&#13;
&#13;
Â· Monitoring and Evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
   o    Evaluations inform staff learning design and delivery but more are&#13;
        needed to provide evidence of what features contribute to impact for&#13;
        which learning objectives. A larger share of the learning budget&#13;
        should be dedicated to evaluation activities.&#13;
&#13;
   o    Programs designated for evaluation by WBIEG are typically high&#13;
        priority initiatives, but there is not a clear process for how programs&#13;
        are selected in any given year. A strategy should be developed to&#13;
        ensure that all types of activities in use for staff learning are evaluated&#13;
        over time.&#13;
&#13;
   o    VPUs have an interest in analyzing extant data as part of their own&#13;
        efforts to monitor trends and evaluate program results. Given the&#13;
        many difficulties with extracting BW data and the need for informed&#13;
        staff to monitor the accuracy of data files, the KLB should establish a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   xii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                    procedure for requesting data assistance on a trial basis to assess how&#13;
                    much technical assistance is needed.&#13;
&#13;
         The SLF is likely to optimize the learning available for Bank staff over time. The&#13;
findings of this review confirm that this new organization has started to clarify&#13;
responsibilities for staff learning and increased accountability--particularly through&#13;
monitoring quality and, in some cases, evaluating program impact. However, after the&#13;
SLF's first four years, it has not yet resolved some key challenges for staff learning.&#13;
Operational training still needs to be strengthened. A cohesive strategy for developing&#13;
effective managers should be developed. Many learning activities continue to rely on&#13;
tools and methods that are not aligned with adult learning needs. Incremental changes&#13;
are still warranted to strengthen the learning infrastructure, including further clarification&#13;
on the appropriate roles for regions and networks and a more systematic approach to&#13;
identifying opportunities for collaboration among stakeholders responsible for learning.&#13;
Going forward, the KLB must define the indicators of success, through which to set&#13;
corporate learning priorities and to gauge progress towards the SLF's objectives.&#13;

                              1.       INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
1.1     Staff learning is of central importance to the Bank's operations. Developing the&#13;
cutting-edge knowledge, skills, and behaviors to fight poverty and build client capacity is&#13;
critical to the Bank's success. In FY04, the Bank spent $81.7 million on staff learning.&#13;
Approximately half of this amount was expended on training received (supporting staff&#13;
participation in learning Â­ from both internal and external sources), while the balance was&#13;
spent on training delivered (development and delivery of 3,300 staff learning activities).&#13;
In FY05, $81.9 million was spent altogether on staff learning (training delivered&#13;
accounted for 2,861 learning activities) (World Bank 2004a, 2005).&#13;
&#13;
1.2     The Staff Learning Framework (SLF) was established in FY01 and includes a&#13;
Learning Board. The Chief Learning Officer (CLO), who reports to the vice presidents&#13;
of Human Resources (HRS) and the World Bank Institute (WBI), chairs the Board. This&#13;
independent review focuses on whether the SLF has led to improvements in the&#13;
relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of staff learning. The study addresses two&#13;
objectives:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· To inform on the progress in implementing the SLF's mandate (relevance and&#13;
              efficiency) and the outcomes/impact (effectiveness) of the SLF's overall&#13;
              strategy in advancing staff learning, as compared to the previous&#13;
              arrangements for staff learning; and,&#13;
&#13;
        Â· To provide recommendations on what the Bank and the SLF leaders must do&#13;
              to ensure that staff learning results in effective and efficient use of resources.&#13;
&#13;
1.3     Data sources included documents and archival data related to staff learning and&#13;
interviews with 74 Bank staff. In addition, a benchmarking consultant compared the&#13;
Bank's professional development systems and practices with those of six other large&#13;
organizations and reviewed data from industry standards. A description of the study&#13;
methodology with the evaluation questions is in Appendix A.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      2.         THE NEW STAFF LEARNING FRAMEWORK:&#13;
       OBJECTIVES, ORGANIZATION, AND PROCESSES&#13;
&#13;
2.1      The Bank adopted the SLF at the end of FY01 to provide staff with the&#13;
knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to perform their roles effectively. The&#13;
organizational changes designed to align professional development with core business&#13;
needs included devolving decisionmaking from the vice presidential level to the&#13;
managers responsible for learning, giving regions and other major operational users of&#13;
learning a greater role in the management of the learning program, creating a community&#13;
of practitioners with corporate accountability, and defining clear lines of authority. In&#13;
contrast to previous arrangements for staff learning, the new model emphasizes quality&#13;
rather than quantity and prioritizes the development of systems to support progress&#13;
towards new objectives. Not surprisingly, the major organizational and systems changes&#13;
envisioned for the SLF have required years to implement. Any assessment of the results&#13;
for staff learning (chapter 3) should occur with this understanding.&#13;
&#13;
                     A BRIEF HISTORY OF BANK STAFF LEARNING: 1996-2005&#13;
&#13;
2.2      Over the past decade, the World Bank Group has launched several initiatives&#13;
designed to link staff learning with business results.1 In 1996, an education and training&#13;
effort to raise staff professional standards and diversify skills was a key element in the&#13;
new commitment to become a "Knowledge Bank" (World Bank 1996). The Strategic&#13;
Compact followed in 1997 with a number of renewal strategies, including a&#13;
comprehensive reform of the Bank's human resource policies. This reform specified that&#13;
learning should be driven by business needs to enhance development effectiveness.&#13;
Under the Compact, the major provider for learning and training activities for staff was&#13;
the Learning and Leadership Center (LLC) and the one for clients was the Economic&#13;
Development Institute (EDI). The structure for learning and knowledge management was&#13;
streamlined in 1998 and 1999, with the merger of governance functions into the new&#13;
Knowledge and Learning Council (KLC) and the merger of EDI and LLC into the new&#13;
World Bank Institute (WBI).&#13;
&#13;
2.3      In FY01, a review of staff learning identified ongoing challenges for the KLC.&#13;
Some 60 learning stakeholders used the participatory "Accelerating Results Together"&#13;
(ART) process to develop recommendations for strengthening the impact and&#13;
effectiveness of staff learning. The SLF is an outgrowth of this effort. A summary of&#13;
this history is shown in figure 1, and a detailed history of staff learning during this period&#13;
is presented in Appendix B.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1Some initiatives focused not only on staff learning but also on client learning or knowledge sharing. The&#13;
focus in this report is limited to staff learning since that is the function analogous to the SLF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                                           effectiveness.&#13;
 The ART Process was used by stakeholders to identify&#13;
 steps for strengthening staff learning. The results&#13;
 contributed to the establishment of the Learning Board&#13;
 and chief learning officer (CLO) position.                                                                    Learning and Leadership Council (LLC)&#13;

&#13;
2.4           The new organization of the SLF called for a senior, full-time chief learning&#13;
officer (CLO) to oversee staff learning.2 The first CLO, who reports to the HR vice&#13;
president and the WBI vice president, was appointed in June 2001, and a Learning Board&#13;
was established with representatives from the regions, networks, other key learning&#13;
providers, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC).3 The manager of the WBI&#13;
Evaluation Group (WBIEG) was appointed to the Learning Board, ex officio--signifying&#13;
the formal role of systematic evaluation within the new framework. To support quality&#13;
learning better, the Learning Support Group (LSG) was created in the CLO's office.&#13;
Figure 2 illustrates the SLF's organizational structure at the time of its establishment, and&#13;
table 1 shows the current membership.&#13;

The new framework: learning and business results&#13;
&#13;
2.5      The SLF's overall objective is to link learning with business objectives through a&#13;
more effective process than the high-level learning calendar model used under the KLC.4&#13;
&#13;
2.6      The SLF was designed to strengthen the organization and accountability for staff&#13;
learning and to encourage changes in content and methodology. As shown in table 2, the&#13;
new model recognizes that the changing context of the Bank's work requires its staff to&#13;
have a broad set of knowledge, skills, and behaviors that go beyond narrowly defined&#13;
technical expertise. The SLF also emphasizes diverse learning tools and methodologies.&#13;

programs and action steps to align learning with business needs, are shown in table 3.&#13;

                                                                5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.8     At the center of the vision for the SLF is a strategic, transparent, and demand&#13;
driven framework for resource management. To link learning to business objectives, the&#13;
CLO and Learning Board introduced a process for developing annual vice presidential&#13;
unit (VPU) learning plans to set priorities for each year. Funds were allocated&#13;
strategically based on both corporate learning priorities as identified by new SLCs and&#13;
demand as presented in the VPU learning plans.&#13;
&#13;
Timeline&#13;
&#13;
2.9     Building the new framework required organizational changes. By the start of&#13;
FY03, most key pieces of the new architecture were in place, with the changes explicitly&#13;
designed to do the following:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Create a demand driven system with simplified funding arrangements;&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Foster a shift from monitoring dollars to tracking products and quality;&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Introduce clear accountabilities for different kinds of learning, cutting down&#13;
            on gaps and duplications;&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Provide more focus on operational, behavioral and interaction skills, and on&#13;
            learning at the operational and country team levels; and&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Strengthen learning support systems (World Bank 2002).&#13;
&#13;
2.10    Key pieces of the SLF were instituted from FY02 through FY05. A timeline of&#13;
the major milestones for change is presented in table 4.&#13;
&#13;
Table 4. Milestones in the implementation of the Staff Learning Framework&#13;
&#13;
 FY 2002       The Learning Board, chaired by the CLO, began regular meetings.&#13;
&#13;
               The Learning Support Group (LSG) was created in the CLO's office to support better quality learning.&#13;
&#13;
               An E-learning Working Group was established to coordinate with the Information Services Group&#13;
               (ISG) and other units to oversee pilots designed to show the potential of e-learning.&#13;
&#13;
               The process for developing VPU learning plans was instituted.&#13;
&#13;
               The Learning Board instituted a competitive funding process to support innovative learning proposals.&#13;
&#13;
               The Learning Board launched a Bankwide communications program to increase the awareness of&#13;
               managers and staff about responsibilities and opportunities related to staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
               The WBIEG was assigned responsibility for the systematic evaluation of learning activities.&#13;
&#13;
 FY 2003       The CLO began reporting to both the VP of Human Resources and the VP of WBI to increase&#13;
               synergy between the client learning and staff learning efforts.&#13;
&#13;
               Regions were given a formal role, with funds provided to design and deliver regionwide and country-&#13;
               specific activities as well as to pay for staff time to attend learning events.&#13;
&#13;
               Ten Strategic Learning Centers were designated to develop, deliver, and ensure quality in Bankwide&#13;
               learning.&#13;
&#13;
               WBI became responsible for LSG, learning facility management, and learning catalog services.&#13;
&#13;
               Internal fees for all Bank-sponsored learning events were eliminated, both to reduce bureaucracy and&#13;
               transaction costs and to encourage staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     (Table 4 continues on the next page.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(Table 4 continued.)&#13;
&#13;
 FY 2004            The Learning Board, WBI, and ISG started the Integrated Knowledge and Learning Environment&#13;
                    Program (KLE) to improve access to and use of the Bank's knowledge resources.&#13;
&#13;
                    The process continued (as part of KLE) to replace existing systems with state-of-the-art learning&#13;
                    management and learning content management systems (LMS/LCMS).&#13;
&#13;
FY 2005             LSG, staff learning facilities, the Learning Catalog/new Learning Management Systems and Services&#13;
                    were moved to the CLO's office.&#13;
&#13;
                    New Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were instituted for staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
                    The CLO's office was assigned oversight of the Bank's operational knowledge management and&#13;
                    sharing programs.&#13;
&#13;
FY 2006             The Learning Board was relaunched under expanded terms of reference as the Knowledge and&#13;
                    Learning Board in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      GOVERNANCE&#13;
&#13;
2.11      Responsibilities for governing and implementing the new learning agenda have&#13;
evolved with roles and changes in assignments noted in each of the Learning Board's&#13;
annual reports. Despite this documentation, interviews with major stakeholders revealed&#13;
some confusion about who could best serve a particular role or how to best implement&#13;
certain functions.&#13;
&#13;
Overall strategy and policy&#13;
&#13;
2.12      Final accountability for staff learning rests with the CLO. Each member of the&#13;
Learning Board, representing the respective SLC or region, has responsibility for the&#13;
design and implementation of their learning program. The terms of reference for the&#13;
Learning Board describe "a mix of oversight, advisory, and decisionmaking roles."5 Key&#13;
among these roles is establishing overall learning strategy and policy. In addition, the&#13;
Learning Board has formal operating agreements and procedures in place to specify the&#13;
membership process and the Board's composition. In contrast to the KLC, not all Board&#13;
members have been managers, so these specifications were designed to ensure that Board&#13;
members can participate effectively in strategic decisionmaking and implement policies&#13;
within their VPUs.6&#13;
&#13;
2.13      Several Board members expressed confusion or concern about the Board's&#13;
composition and functions despite the specifications documented by the Board's terms of&#13;
reference and operating agreements. Recurring issues include the following:&#13;
&#13;
          Â· Member Profile. Some members have an extensive background in learning;&#13;
                some have years of experience in Bank operations; and some have a balanced&#13;
                composition of both. In addition, some members are at more senior levels&#13;
                than others. Several of the stakeholders interviewed suggested clarifying the&#13;
                appropriate profile for a Board member to increase the Board's effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5The current roles, responsibilities, and operating agreements for the Learning Board are in Appendix D.&#13;
6In FY06, the Learning Board was reconstituted as the Knowledge and Learning Board--with members at&#13;
salary grade GH or higher.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                               7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
           Â· Size of the Board. Meetings often have 20 to 30 members and observers&#13;
                  present. Some members felt that this large size, combined with uneven&#13;
                  member profiles, made the Board too unwieldy to discuss issues effectively&#13;
                  or make decisions.&#13;
&#13;
           Â· Voting rights. Members want clear justification for why some VPUs have&#13;
                  voting rights and others do not. Some stakeholders also wondered whether&#13;
                  votes should be weighted based on the number of staff represented.&#13;
&#13;
           Â· Meeting Dynamics. Many members reported that Board meetings are at&#13;
                  times ineffective or even contentious. Most attributed meeting problems to&#13;
                  the diverse profiles of members and large size of the Board and&#13;
                  acknowledged that the CLO had the difficult responsibility of facilitating&#13;
                  these sessions.&#13;
&#13;
2.14       Board members and alternates expressed various levels of concern about the&#13;
Board's effectiveness as a body for staff learning. These stakeholders generally felt&#13;
empowered to advise their VPUs on setting learning priorities and aligning learning plans&#13;
with work programs, but some were not convinced that being a Board member augments&#13;
or complements their VPU-level role. Some were concerned that the Learning Board is&#13;
not empowered to set learning policy at the institutional level and address crosscutting&#13;
issues related to learning--despite evidence in meeting minutes that the Board did&#13;
establish learning policy. Recurring concerns expressed by Board members are presented&#13;
in table 5.&#13;
&#13;
Table 5. Issues cited in interviews about Learning Board's role and responsibilities&#13;
&#13;
                    Issue                                                 Examples of Concern&#13;
&#13;
 Staffing trends, including the             Due to staff turnover, some senior personnel have little Bank experience. In&#13;
 decrease of senior and experienced         addition, the Bank's organizational changes have included placing different&#13;
 staff in the field, cause challenges in    personnel in the field and decreasing the number of senior specialists. Both&#13;
 providing timely and appropriate           of these trends present challenges to learning, with less experienced staff&#13;
 learning opportunities.                    meeting with government ministers. One learning coordinator expressed a&#13;
                                            sense of "never being able to catch up" with the training needs of new staff.&#13;
                                            Another stakeholder asserted that the high turnover underscored the need for&#13;
                                            learning roadmaps to ensure that new staff receive core training to&#13;
                                            understand the Bank's business better.&#13;
&#13;
 Resource management needs to be            Some units have designed their own systems or methods for tracking&#13;
 strengthened and standardized.             learning allocations and expenditures because "existing tools are inadequate"&#13;
                                            (especially SAP).a&#13;
&#13;
 Sector week objectives must be             Members from SLCs and regions acknowledged that sector weeks are&#13;
 clarified.                                 controversial because they absorb a major share of regional staff time under&#13;
                                            training received and network human resources. Some suggested that&#13;
                                            decisions about sector weeks should be made at the institutional level, and&#13;
                                            that much of the tension could be resolved by better defining sector week&#13;
                                            objectives and identifying which components are learning activities.&#13;
&#13;
 The assessment of staff learning           Methods to assess staff learning needs vary widely. Some VPUs conduct&#13;
 needs should be more rigorous and          surveys and have formal coordination with sector boards, while some VPU&#13;
 systematic.                                representatives acknowledged that needs assessments are "not particularly&#13;
                                            systematic." A few suggested that the Board could help by identifying best&#13;
                                            practices on needs assessments or tools that could then be applied in other&#13;
                                            units.&#13;
&#13;
 aSAP (Systems, Applications, and Products) is the brand name of business-application software that supports many of the Bank's&#13;
 core administrative processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.15     Most stakeholders value the representative nature of the Board and did not argue&#13;
for a reduced size. However, several argued that using teams or establishing formal&#13;
subcommittees to focus on action items would increase the Board's effectiveness and&#13;
participation in decisionmaking.&#13;
&#13;
Resource allocation&#13;
&#13;
2.16     Funds provided for staff learning are used for direct costs (learning design,&#13;
delivery, and follow-up), learning received (staff time and related travel), and the&#13;
organizational structures to support staff learning. The allocation of resources for staff&#13;
learning occurs as part of the Bank's overall budget process. An overview of the&#13;
institutional processes and budget guidelines for staff learning is in Appendix C.&#13;
&#13;
2.17     With input from a strategic note prepared by the CLO, Bank senior management&#13;
and the Corporate Resource Management Group (SFRRM) first set the annual corporate&#13;
amount dedicated to staff learning, as administered by the Learning Board.7 The CLO,&#13;
with advice and input from the Learning Board, then recommends the allocation per VPU&#13;
and the amounts dedicated for evaluation, learning advisory services, and other costs&#13;
related to learning. The CLO follows a general formula which has been documented in&#13;
the Learning Board meeting minutes as shown in box 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Box 1. Example of FY05 budget allocation for staff learning&#13;
&#13;
 Allocations for FY05 were discussed at a meeting in March 2004 to gain Board advice given the high probability that&#13;
 funding would remain at the FY04 level. The general formula and assumptions used to allocate the budget for FY05&#13;
 were as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Â·    Regions would be funded at 4 percent of their net administrative budget if possible.&#13;
      Â·    P&amp;T Network SLC funds would be redistributed using a weighting system. Sixty percent would be&#13;
           weighted to business needs as measured by the percentage of sectors and themes in the regional work&#13;
           programs. Forty percent would be weighted to headcount, including the number of networked staff plus the&#13;
           number of anchor staff. In this redistribution, budget reductions would be limited to 15 percent, and&#13;
           increases would be limited to 10 percent.&#13;
      Â·    Management and Process and Interaction (P&amp;I) SLCs would be cut by 10 percent.&#13;
      Â·    The amounts for all other units would be held constant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.18     SLCs distribute funding across their programs according to business priorities,&#13;
and regions distribute funding based on team learning needs, regional priorities, and&#13;
individual needs. This happens as part of the process to develop VPU learning plans&#13;
(described below).&#13;
&#13;
2.19      Stakeholders reported that tracking costs is a challenge, in part due to complex&#13;
budget reports and procedures in SAP (the Bank's accounting system), other user and&#13;
system errors in data entry (including participant errors in assigning costs to staff&#13;
learning), and the lack of financial management experience of many Board members.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7Individual units and VPUs can dedicate additional resources to learning from other funds in their base&#13;
budgets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Abilities to track costs vary, with some VPUs doing this well and others doing it&#13;
inadequately. WBIEG is studying cost effectiveness for the Board.&#13;
&#13;
2.20    Many Board members expressed concern about the budget allocation process,&#13;
both because the formulas for allocating funds are unclear and because members have a&#13;
vested interest in the budget allocations to their own VPUs. Some members noted that&#13;
competing interests linked to negotiating funding impede the Board's development as a&#13;
community of practice. One recurring suggestion was to appoint an advisory board or&#13;
council with authority for policy and budget matters. Suggestions ranged from having a&#13;
few senior managers in the Bank meet on a quarterly basis to convening an external body&#13;
comprised of experts from the academic and private sector.8&#13;
&#13;
Communication&#13;
&#13;
2.21    The SLF's designers noted that "the Bank has never had a well-articulated&#13;
learning strategy in the past," and that a critical step for the new framework is "to&#13;
develop a clear vision and strategy for learning that is widely communicated, accepted by&#13;
all, and forms the basis for the design and delivery of the learning program" (World Bank&#13;
2001b). Developing a communications strategy was an early priority for the CLO and&#13;
Learning Board--with quarterly and annual reports, a new staff learning website, a series&#13;
of intranet "kiosk" announcements, a new brochure, briefings to key VPUs, articles in the&#13;
Bank's internal web news brief Today, and evaluation results posted on the staff learning&#13;
and WBIEG websites all part of a new strategy starting in FY02 (World Bank 2003a).&#13;
&#13;
2.22    Board members are expected to provide information and guidance to staff on the&#13;
Bank's learning initiatives, and individual VPUs have their own strategies for&#13;
communications on staff learning. As a general rule, the SLCs and regional learning&#13;
committees notify staff about upcoming learning opportunities by listing the activities in&#13;
the Learning Catalog and sending e-mail announcements of upcoming events. Board&#13;
members send e-mails to their VPUs announcing key policy decisions or new major&#13;
initiatives. The CLO's office sends notices on new developments and best practices&#13;
related to staff learning and has implemented communication activities such as hosting a&#13;
learning fair. Also, WBIEG circulates WBI Evaluation Briefs related to staff learning&#13;
evaluations to all Board members.&#13;
&#13;
2.23    When discussing communication strategies, several Board members noted that&#13;
efforts to inform personnel about staff learning should be further refined given the heavy&#13;
reliance on written notices that Bank staff are too busy to read. The most common&#13;
suggestions for improving communication included having a Learning Board&#13;
representative (e.g., a member of the CLO's staff) visit staff meetings within VPUs and&#13;
assigning managers formal responsibilities for informing their employees of appropriate&#13;
learning opportunities, changes that were already implemented during FY02-FY03.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8The newly established Knowledge and Learning Board will have a Governing Council to provide&#13;
corporate oversight. The Bank's Managing Director will appoint no more than five directors drawn from&#13;
various parts of the Bank. The council will meet at least twice yearly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                       ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS&#13;
&#13;
2.24      Intensive efforts to develop systems to track and support learning and link&#13;
learning activities to business objectives have marked the first phase of the new SLF.&#13;
Any assessment of the SLF's success or accomplishments thus far (chapter 3) must be&#13;
based on an understanding of the creation and refinement of the interrelated systems&#13;
designed to ground learning in results.&#13;
&#13;
Facilitating learning and knowledge sharing&#13;
&#13;
2.25      Over time, the CLO and Learning Board have developed and improved systems to&#13;
capture and track learning activity and cost data. These systems serve important&#13;
monitoring purposes but also work to link staff with appropriate learning opportunities&#13;
and provide data for WBIEG studies. Major examples include the following:&#13;
&#13;
          Â· Learning catalog: This central resource on learning opportunities was&#13;
                developed prior to the SLF but was improved since FY02.9 The online&#13;
                catalog allowed staff to search for activities and to register for those of&#13;
                interest. Providers were able to manage the registration process through the&#13;
                catalog and send records to PeopleSoft (the personnel data system) based on&#13;
                successful completion of course criteria. The catalog was criticized for many&#13;
                data inaccuracies (largely due to the uneven use by learning providers), but it&#13;
                served as the functional precursor to a full Learning Management System.10&#13;
&#13;
          Â· Business warehouse staff learning cube: The CLO and Learning Board have&#13;
                focused repeatedly on addressing the problems of inaccuracy in archival data&#13;
                on staff learning. Following the rollout of the revised catalog in FY03, the&#13;
                Learning Board has worked with ISG and SFRRM to develop a staff learning&#13;
                cube (a tool to manipulate data from databases including the Learning&#13;
                Catalog and SAP) within Business Warehouse (BW), the Bank's central&#13;
                database recording activity, personnel, and cost data. The Bank's learning&#13;
                community gained access in FY05 to data collection and reporting functions&#13;
                available through BW; however, data quality issues remain given problems&#13;
                with the Learning Catalog (discussed above) and difficulties linking costs to&#13;
                activities.11&#13;
&#13;
          Â· Learning management system: In early FY06 a full learning management&#13;
                system (LMS) was implemented, eliminating the need for the Learning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9The Learning Catalog, developed by WBI, was used for client learning until being revamped under the&#13;
Learning Board to serve staff learning needs.&#13;
10Learning activities in the field were often not reported in the Learning Catalog. In addition, learning&#13;
activities that are team-based or have coaching or other less traditional formats have been historically&#13;
underreported according to the Learning Board's annual reports and interviews with stakeholders.&#13;
Incremental enhancements have been made over time to improve data quality--for example, streamlining&#13;
the data-entry process to record one-time events.&#13;
11The CLO's office continues to recognize and address data issues for continuous improvement. Examples&#13;
of unreliable data fields include the one for the number of participants who actually attended an event&#13;
versus the number who were expected. Since some providers automatically enter the same number for&#13;
both, it is impossible to analyze accurately supply and demand issues using BW.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            Catalog. The LMS is expected to benefit staff learning in three ways. First,&#13;
            all the SAP and LMS links will be automated, so that when staff register for&#13;
            learning events, PeopleSoft will record the relevant data automatically.&#13;
            Second, the LMS will link directly to technology tools such as the Bank's e-&#13;
            learning platform. The system will therefore track all activities that use the e-&#13;
            learning platform and all participants who register for these events. Third,&#13;
            the LMS will include roadmaps or guidance on professional pathways for&#13;
            staff. This learning advisory service will use staff profiles to provide&#13;
            information on what knowledge and skills are needed to meet the objectives&#13;
            of an individual's work program and for career advancement. The&#13;
            development of the LMS is part of an initiative (the Knowledge and Learning&#13;
            Environment) to integrate the Bank's staff learning and knowledge&#13;
            management/sharing activities and ensure that these are directly relevant to&#13;
            operational staff.&#13;
&#13;
Aligning learning activities with business needs&#13;
&#13;
2.26    The CLO and Learning Board have also instituted processes across the Bank to&#13;
support business-driven staff learning. Key among these is the development of VPU&#13;
learning plans. Progress towards implementing the Bank's Strategic Framework is&#13;
monitored at the corporate level, and staff learning is recognized as a critical ingredient in&#13;
the twin pillars of the Bank's approach--building the climate for investment, jobs, and&#13;
sustainable growth, and investing in and empowering poor people to participate in&#13;
development (World Bank 2003b).&#13;
&#13;
2.27    Each VPU prepares a learning plan based on business priorities, staff learning&#13;
needs, and budget. Learning plans include details of planned activities, budgets, and&#13;
timetables. In keeping with a decentralized approach, procedures for developing the&#13;
VPU learning plans vary widely depending on the region, SLC, or other type of unit.&#13;
VPUs establish their own processes for assessing their priorities and for identifying staff&#13;
learning needs. These systems rely on formal bodies such as regional learning&#13;
committees and sector boards and draw on institutional processes such as individual&#13;
learning plans submitted by staff. Units typically gather additional information about&#13;
staff learning needs through staff surveys, focus groups, and informal conversations with&#13;
managers.&#13;
&#13;
2.28    Staff members in the CLO's office review the learning plans and monitor progress&#13;
against them through quarterly business reviews. The CLO and Learning Board have&#13;
established standard templates and processes for the development of VPU learning plans&#13;
and quarterly reports, facilitating the link between learning activities and business&#13;
objectives across all Bank units. Minutes from Board meetings indicate that these tools&#13;
have been improved based on member feedback, and new systems are developed to&#13;
streamline monitoring efforts. For example, the Board approved a monitoring process in&#13;
July 2002 wherein learning events that cost $20,000 or above require an Activity&#13;
Initiation Summary (AIS) in SAP. In FY06, the Board proposed increasing this amount&#13;
to $40,000. Data entered into the AIS then are recorded automatically in the Learning&#13;
Catalog.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                   MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
&#13;
2.29     The Learning Board is responsible for ensuring the systematic monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of learning activities. Since FY02, the Board has provided funds to WBIEG&#13;
for this function. In FY05, WBIEG costs represented 1.4 percent of the learning budget&#13;
of $69.5 million. A breakdown of funds from FY02-FY05 is found in table 6.&#13;
&#13;
               Table 6. Learning Board funds spent by WBIEG for monitoring&#13;
               and evaluation work (including overhead costs)&#13;

&#13;
                       02         696,861                          1.0%&#13;
&#13;
                       03         977,090                          1.4%&#13;
&#13;
                       04        1,035,026                         1.3%&#13;
&#13;
                       05         972,473                          1.2%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.30     This emphasis on evaluation distinguishes the SLF from previous arrangements&#13;
for staff learning, and WBIEG has refined evaluation practices and methods during the&#13;
first phase of the SLF.&#13;
&#13;
Level 1 evaluation&#13;
&#13;
2.31     Level 1 evaluations identify participants' reactions to learning activities. WBIEG&#13;
conducts these evaluations on a stratified random sample of staff learning events and&#13;
provides an on-line level 1 toolkit for learning managers to apply a similar process to&#13;
nonsampled courses. Current and former Board members generally characterized level 1&#13;
as a monitoring activity: favorable ratings by participants at the end of an activity do not&#13;
link directly to impact, but positive outcomes are unlikely to occur in the absence of basic&#13;
quality. WBIEG has improved the level 1 process and developed tools over time:&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Sampling: A rigorous stratified random sampling process has replaced&#13;
               volunteer and convenience samples. In FY03, courses were eligible for&#13;
               selection if (a) they were registered as formal events in the Learning Catalog&#13;
               two weeks before the activity's starting date, (b) Bank staff comprised at least&#13;
               half of the attendees, (c) the delivery mode was face-to-face or distance&#13;
               learning, and (d) WBIEG had not evaluated the course already in that same&#13;
               year.12 In FY04, selection was stratified by the sponsor VPU for the first&#13;
               time, ensuring that enough courses would be selected per unit to permit valid&#13;
               inferences regarding differences among sponsors.&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Toolkit: WBIEG provides materials for units to administer their own level 1&#13;
               questionnaires for nonsampled activities. Many learning stakeholders noted&#13;
               that this toolkit serves important functions in facilitating level 1 evaluations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12Problems with the timely administrator entry of activities in the Learning Catalog have provided some&#13;
challenges to this process. Ongoing systems improvements allow for a greater percentage of all learning&#13;
activities to be recorded, which supports more accurate sampling techniques each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            and maintaining consistent measurement across subunits. WBIEG provides&#13;
            technical assistance in this process, sending team members to speak at staff&#13;
            meetings, supporting providers in scanning their questionnaires, and helping&#13;
            with analysis.&#13;
&#13;
       Â· Quality reports and interactive website: WBIEG provides trainers with level&#13;
            1 results, usually within two weeks after the activity's completion. WBIEG&#13;
            recently launched an interactive website where course results can be viewed,&#13;
            aggregated, and compared with other results from the same or other course&#13;
            providers. This website generates reports comparing results across VPUs,&#13;
            across individual course providers, or across courses of the same provider&#13;
            over time. The system contains level 1 data from FY04 to the present.&#13;
&#13;
2.32   Since the Learning Board was instituted, WBIEG has established a standard&#13;
questionnaire to track level 1 results across years, increased the coverage of activities&#13;
(from 140 activities in FY02 to 307 in FY05), and added two questions to support&#13;
comparison with benchmarks from the American Society for Training and Development&#13;
(ASTD).&#13;
&#13;
Program evaluation&#13;
&#13;
2.33   In addition to assessing participant reactions, WBIEG establishes a work plan&#13;
with the Learning Board each year to determine whether participants acquired new skills,&#13;
knowledge, or behaviors and then used them on the job with a positive impact on&#13;
operational products or processes.&#13;
&#13;
2.34   The selection of programs for evaluation has focused on (a) "high priority"&#13;
programs of various SLCs, (b) regional programs, and (c) network programs. "High&#13;
priority" programs are those that have required a major investment of resources and are&#13;
designed to address specific challenges that precipitated the establishment of the new&#13;
learning framework (e.g., Introduction to Bank Operations, New Managers' Leadership&#13;
Program, and Multisectoral Teams Program). Regional programs comprise all learning&#13;
offered to or undertaken by regional staff (e.g. East Asia and the Pacific Regional&#13;
Program, South Asia Regional Program). Network programs comprise all learning&#13;
offered by the Network Anchors/Hubs (e.g. HD Staff Learning Program). Other studies&#13;
have examined the effectiveness of innovative approaches (e.g., the e-learning program&#13;
for Trust Fund Accreditation). Table 7 lists the evaluations completed to date for each&#13;
VPU.&#13;

&#13;
2.35      Since the start of the SLF, WBIEG efforts to refine evaluation methods and&#13;
practices have resulted in better tests of participant learning and improved evaluation&#13;
designs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Level 2 tests of learning&#13;
&#13;
2.36     WBIEG conducts level 2 evaluations to identify learning outcomes by&#13;
administering objective multiple-choice tests at the start and end of the learning activity.&#13;
Since the start of the SLF, WBIEG has tested learning for only two programs (IBO and&#13;
TLAP).13 Some Learning Board stakeholders expressed a strong interest in developing&#13;
and administering valid and reliable tests of learning outcomes for other programs, but&#13;
time and cost considerations and buy-in from course providers have limited these efforts.&#13;
Refinements in the measurement of learning since the SLF was established have included&#13;
better test forms and reliability.&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Parallel forms: Prior to FY02, pre and posttests were prepared from a single&#13;
               item pool, where questions were randomly assigned to test forms. This&#13;
               random assignment did not ensure that each test included items for all topics&#13;
               of a learning event or that item difficulties were comparable across both&#13;
               forms. To improve comparability, WBIEG developed a two-dimensional&#13;
               matrix covering content topics and levels of difficulty. This was further&#13;
               improved in FY03 when the evaluators issued guidelines for pairing items to&#13;
               improve the parallelism of pre and posttests.&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Reliability: WBIEG analyzed the internal reliability of tests and found that&#13;
               those administered in FY99-FY01 were well below professional standards&#13;
               (Lockheed 2004).14 The evaluators improved the reliability by using&#13;
               statistical item analysis of previous tests to clarify questions, increasing the&#13;
               number of items to make the test better represent the course content, and&#13;
               providing guidance on test development to training providers.&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation designs&#13;
&#13;
2.37     WBIEG has improved the designs of program evaluations to assess the outcomes&#13;
and impact of staff learning programs. These improvements include the use of&#13;
counterfactuals, multivariate analyses, and mixed methods (Lockheed 2004).&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Use of comparison groups or counterfactuals: WBIEG has used two types of&#13;
               counterfactuals or "control groups" to assess the effectiveness of staff&#13;
               learning. The evaluators have conducted postlearning matching of&#13;
               participants with nonparticipants through propensity-score matching or other&#13;
               types of trait-by-trait matching techniques and prelearning matching of&#13;
               participants with other similar nonparticipants scheduled for subsequent&#13;
               participation.15&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Analysis: The use of counterfactuals and scientific sampling has led to&#13;
               increasingly sophisticated analysis in contrast to the simple descriptive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13WBIEG conducts level 2 evaluations for client learning programs also.&#13;
14The average reliability coefficient was about 0.44 with a range of 0.10 to 0.70.&#13;
15Propensity score matching is possible when data exist for a large number of individuals, only some of&#13;
whom have participated in the learning event. This technique estimates the probability of an individual's&#13;
participation in a learning event.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             statistics used previously or the summaries of interviews and focus groups&#13;
             used for single learning events. Instead, multivariate analyses are used to test&#13;
             hypothetical models of the determinants of effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Mixed methods: Both qualitative and quantitative methods are integrated&#13;
             now into study design. Using mixed methods allows evaluators to confirm&#13;
             findings from multiple perspectives and data sources and to address a broader&#13;
             range of evaluation questions.&#13;
&#13;
2.38    Several current and former Board members noted that the evaluation practices of&#13;
WBIEG have evolved over time, and concerns expressed by individuals generally&#13;
focused on not being able to secure WBIEG services for evaluating the impact of specific&#13;
learning initiatives in their VPUs. WBIEG has declined to conduct evaluations for staff&#13;
learning in three ways: (a) by not evaluating all courses at level 1 and using a stratified&#13;
random sample instead, (b) by not conducting level 2 evaluations when there was no buy-&#13;
in from the course provider, and (c) by not conducting level 3-4 (outcome and impact)&#13;
evaluations beyond those financed through the Learning Board when neither staff nor&#13;
resources were available.&#13;
&#13;
2.39    In addition to focusing on individual programs, WBIEG conducts general studies&#13;
and metaevaluations to examine patterns across studies and to identify best practices to&#13;
inform learning design and delivery efforts. Some Board members observed that such&#13;
efforts to isolate factors for success or to describe effective learning design features are&#13;
especially helpful for planning "cutting-edge" network events that are unlikely to be&#13;
offered more than once.&#13;
&#13;
2.40    The overview and processes of the new framework described in this chapter do&#13;
not represent an exhaustive list of the systems and initiatives undertaken for staff learning&#13;
since FY01. The discussion has focused largely on key Bankwide initiatives, but it is&#13;
important to note that many other systems and approaches have been attempted or&#13;
implemented at the VPU level. In total, the interrelated set of processes that have&#13;
evolved over the past four years now serve key functions in the new framework,&#13;
monitoring quality and assessing impact to inform and improve the design and delivery&#13;
of learning activities.&#13;
&#13;

        3.      RESULTS OF THE NEW STAFF LEARNING&#13;
                                   FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
3.1     The new SLF emerged as a necessary corollary to the Bank's changing business&#13;
strategies. A broad set of competencies--beyond individual technical expertise--was&#13;
identified as integral to the success of the Bank's evolving work. The SLF's objectives&#13;
were not set forth as discrete measurable targets but instead represent conceptual shifts&#13;
that link learning to business results. The broad objectives lack clear definition by design&#13;
to accommodate the diverse needs of a decentralized system. For example, new forms of&#13;
pedagogy such as e-learning gain priority insofar as they comprise an effective means for&#13;
engaging staff in the field and providing high quality learning opportunities. The goal is&#13;
not to achieve a quota of e-learning activities but rather to increase the strategic use of&#13;
new forms of pedagogy to create effective learning activities for working adults.&#13;
&#13;
3.2     Any assessment of progress toward the SLF's objectives must acknowledge that&#13;
they are interrelated. Efforts to develop needed managerial skills, for example, focus not&#13;
only on prioritizing certain learning content but also on incorporating innovative&#13;
practices such as the use of coaching and mentoring. Despite the crosscutting nature of&#13;
each objective, some indicators can be identified to gauge progress, and these are&#13;
discussed throughout this chapter. VPU-level analyses to assess whether the SLF has had&#13;
an effect on the business results of the Bank were not possible within the scope of this&#13;
review.&#13;
&#13;
3.3     The SLF has had mixed experience in terms of achieving progress toward some&#13;
objectives (table 8). However, the new framework does represent a fundamental change&#13;
to ground learning in results, and measurable progress may therefore require more time&#13;
than has elapsed to date. Difficulties exist in assessing progress because of the lack of&#13;
both pre-SLF data and specific indicators against which to measure change.&#13;

                                   GROUNDING LEARNING IN RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
3.4       As described in chapter 2, the SLF's first phase focused on clarifying roles and&#13;
responsibilities and developing or refining systems and processes. Concrete&#13;
accomplishments to date can be accurately appraised only within the context of the new&#13;
paradigm: the various systems and processes do not just provide auxiliary support but&#13;
actually create the pathway to results. The framework (figure 3) tracks products and&#13;
quality rather than just monitoring dollars--with systems data, lessons learned, and&#13;
evaluation results all serving as part of a feedback loop for continuous improvement.&#13;

 3.5         A few of the stakeholders interviewed for this study emphasized that innovative&#13;
 and effective approaches to staff learning had been implemented well before the new&#13;
 framework but that they occurred largely as a result of learning specialists working in&#13;
 isolation. The current structure tracks efforts in the various VPUs and links expertise to&#13;
 promote outcomes over time. The cycle of processes to guide resource allocations&#13;
 represents a major distinction between the SLF and previous arrangements for training in&#13;
 the 1990s. Given this fundamental shift, current results cannot be compared with data&#13;
 from the previous system in most cases.&#13;
&#13;
                        MONITORING: INDICATORS FROM ADMINISTRATIVE DATA&#13;
&#13;
 3.6         Administrative data systems serve key functions in the new framework, tracking&#13;
 learning activities, guiding participants to relevant events, and capturing participant&#13;
 characteristics. These data inform course providers and support the evaluation of&#13;
 outcomes and impacts. The office of the CLO has worked to improve data quality since&#13;
 the SLF's inception and actively works each quarter to reconcile data reported by VPUs&#13;
 with those recorded in the administrative systems.&#13;
&#13;
 Numbers of events&#13;
&#13;
 3.7         In quarterly and annual reports, the Learning Board provides a snapshot of&#13;
 activities to date, often in the format shown in table 9. While this presentation focuses&#13;
 mainly on outputs (numbers of events and participants), it also provides an overview of&#13;
 how efforts are focused on the priorities identified at the start of the SLF, particularly the&#13;
 recommended shifts in content areas. For example, the need to develop core operational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
skills was a challenge noted at the end of the KLC, so the Learning Board specifically&#13;
identifies which activities have been created or redesigned in response and what the&#13;
respective participation levels are.16&#13;

Event types&#13;
&#13;
3.8      Several Board members and other stakeholders noted that one important step in&#13;
measuring progress towards the SLF's objectives would be to examine the overall&#13;
distribution of learning event types and identify whether the emphasis has shifted over&#13;
time. The new framework promotes new forms of pedagogy to better meet the needs of&#13;
working adults, so examining whether other delivery methods have replaced traditional&#13;
classroom learning is one method for gauging progress.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16In some cases, the data reported in the annual and quarterly reports are not in the administrative systems.&#13;
The CLO's office explained that "the data were simply never entered and therefore are not in the BW&#13;
reports." This was particularly true for language learning, communications, and some management&#13;
training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.9      Comparable data regarding event types from the pre-SLF era were not available&#13;
for this study, largely because a key accomplishment of the new framework has been to&#13;
establish the needed systems and processes to track these data over time. Information on&#13;
event types has been systematically recorded in BW since FY03, however, and the&#13;
Learning Board notes known discrepancies or inaccuracies in its reports along with plans&#13;
for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
3.10     Overall, the distribution of event types as recorded in BW has not changed&#13;
significantly over the past three fiscal years (figure 4), but the following caveats should&#13;
be noted: 17&#13;
&#13;
         Â· There have been some programmer errors in tracking e-learning activities.&#13;
              For FY03 and FY04, the 250 listings for e-learning offerings were reused&#13;
              instead of archived, meaning that these activities are now underreported in&#13;
              BW. Furthermore, in FY04 and FY05, only e-learning course completions&#13;
              were listed in BW. There are many more e-learning activities "on offer," or&#13;
              available, that are not reported. Historic data reported in the Learning Board's&#13;
              annual reports have been valuable in estimating activity levels.&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Learning events offered outside of Washington, D.C. were often not recorded&#13;
              in the Learning Catalog because they were intended to attract only local&#13;
              audiences. Data from these unrecorded events do not appear in BW.&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Less traditional modes of delivery are also likely to be underreported in BW.&#13;
              Interviews indicated that the coaching, mentoring, team-based learning&#13;
              events, and retreats may not be entered in the Learning Catalog, making it&#13;
              difficult to assess how frequently these modes are used and with what results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17The numbers reported here from BW are only at the aggregate level. An analysis by VPU conducted for&#13;
this study was deemed inaccurate due to problems with double-counting.&#13;
&#13;

  aThe "other" category includes conferences, meetings, retreats, sector weeks, study tours, coaching, team-&#13;
  based learning, and video conferences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.11        Traditional forms of staff learning (courses, workshops, seminars) still dominate&#13;
the mix of event types, but the Learning Board is working to increase on-the-job learning&#13;
opportunities through the use of teams, coaching and mentoring (captured as "other" in&#13;
figure 4). The Learning Support Group (LSG) has been supporting instructional design&#13;
and quality, assisting VPUs by identifying opportunities for developing customized e-&#13;
learning programs. Despite these efforts, according to the Learning Catalog, the share of&#13;
e-learning has declined slightly. This does not include the off-the-shelf e-learning&#13;
libraries that the Bank has purchased over the last several years (e.g., e-Tutor and the&#13;
Harvard Business Series). LSG worked with OPCS, HRS, the Management SLC, and&#13;
Client Engagement and Teams in FY05 to develop new e-learning modules, with a total&#13;
of 70 new modules scheduled for implementation by the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
3.12        The breakdown of event types provides a useful overview of staff learning&#13;
activities, but these numbers alone cannot be used to assess progress toward the SLF's&#13;
objectives. Effective practices using the new forms of pedagogy--such as e-learning and&#13;
team-based programs--have been identified though the new continuous feedback cycle,&#13;
and these activities are examined below.&#13;
&#13;
Participation&#13;
&#13;
3.13        One of the explicit challenges facing the SLF is how to deliver effective learning&#13;
events to staff in the field who, in many cases, are the ones working directly with the&#13;
Bank's partners in developing countries to achieve business results. Reaching staff in&#13;
country offices has become more important with the decentralization of the Bank's&#13;
business, and innovative practices have included the establishment of hub (region-based)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
trainings and offering learning activities in country offices targeting regionwide&#13;
audiences. Nonetheless, the percentage of learning activities held outside of North&#13;
America has not significantly increased since FY03.18 These data show a decrease in the&#13;
proportion of events held in the field, from 30 percent in FY03 to 16 percent in FY04 and&#13;
14 percent in FY05. However, these numbers do not accurately reflect the involvement&#13;
of country office staff. Many local learning activities in country offices have not been&#13;
recorded in the Learning Catalog.&#13;
&#13;
3.14     Reaching country office staff is one of the SLF's key objectives. The Learning&#13;
Board encourages the SLCs and regions to direct more resources to the field through&#13;
various means, including competitions to fund innovative learning initiatives. In its&#13;
FY04 annual report, the Learning Board noted that less than 10 percent of professional&#13;
and technical SLC learning events were located outside of the Washington, DC area or&#13;
delivered through distance learning. As a result, the Board asked that at least 20 percent&#13;
of each SLC's learning programs for FY05 be "in a form readily accessible to country&#13;
office staff, either through a decentralized location or some form of e-learning" (World&#13;
Bank 2004a). In FY05, 14 percent (414 of 2,861 activities) occurred outside the United&#13;
States, and 5 percent (137) were e-learning.&#13;
&#13;
3.15     The SLF objectives also specify that some events should target staff and clients&#13;
together, where such interaction makes sense. Increasing the activities offered jointly for&#13;
clients and staff is a priority for the Learning Board, but the overall percentage of joint&#13;
client-staff events decreased from FY03 (20 percent) to FY04 (11 percent) and FY05 (12&#13;
percent), according to data from the Learning Catalog. WBIEG recently examined these&#13;
data and found that many activities were mislabeled in the catalog as client-staff when in&#13;
fact they included no or few clients. According to this study, only 5 percent of learning&#13;
activities in FY05 involved interaction among clients and staff (Quizon, Gunnarsson, and&#13;
Rajakaruna 2005). Two possible explanations for the low figure include difficulties with&#13;
mixing separate budgets for staff training and client training and the lack of incentives&#13;
among course providers.&#13;
&#13;
3.16     The Learning Board tracks participation in learning events and recognizes that&#13;
trends in participation provide important information about the accessibility of activities&#13;
and the learning culture at the World Bank. In FY05, the Learning Board reported that&#13;
82 percent of Bank staff attended at least one formal learning event, up from 80 percent&#13;
in FY04, with staff attending three or four activities on average. Eighty-eight percent of&#13;
Washington staff attended at least one learning event, and about 71 percent of field staff&#13;
participated in at least one activity. While 88 percent of GF-GG (higher level) field staff&#13;
participated in at least one activity, only 56 percent of ACS (administrative) field staff&#13;
attended at least one learning activity.&#13;
&#13;
3.17     In FY05, the Learning Board established KPIs to measure progress. Two of these&#13;
track participation in staff learning activities:&#13;
&#13;
18The percentages included here are those reported in the Learning Board's annual reports. This annual&#13;
reporting involves an extensive review process, so these figures were assessed to be most accurate. They&#13;
are not necessarily the same as the numbers recorded in BW or the numbers reported by the Learning&#13;
Board on a quarterly basis, including the fourth quarter retrospective reports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         Â· Percentage of all staff participating in one or more learning activities over the&#13;
              last 12 months (by VPU), and&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Percentage of regional staff participating in two or more learning activities&#13;
              over the last 12 months (by region).&#13;
&#13;
Starting in the third quarter of FY05, these indicators are a part of formal reporting. The&#13;
data in the Learning Board's third quarter report show that an increasing percentage of&#13;
staff overall are attending at least one learning event per year, with nearly three quarters&#13;
(73 percent) having participated in the past 12 months. However, the percentage of&#13;
regional staff attending two or more events fell in FY05 to 41 percent (figure 5).&#13;

Joint-VPU offerings&#13;
&#13;
3.18     One key goal in creating a decentralized framework for staff learning is to break&#13;
down the "supply silos" that provided learning activities under pre-SLF arrangements and&#13;
foster collaboration to avoid the duplication of effort in addressing staff learning needs.&#13;
The number of jointly sponsored courses is potentially a useful indicator of whether the&#13;
previous silos are beginning to break down, but these numbers must also be placed in&#13;
context. The SLCs were designated to clarify accountability for specialized priority&#13;
areas. In many cases, collaboration in specialized areas may not make sense. As one&#13;
Learning Board member noted, "It is not enough for teams to be well-behaved and&#13;
culturally appropriate; they also need specialized technical expertise."&#13;
&#13;
3.19     Tracking the number of jointly sponsored learning activities across years relies on&#13;
data from the Learning Catalog.19 Revamping the Learning Catalog was a major&#13;
&#13;
19Joint offerings are problematic in the BW staff learning cube. There is a "joint offering" field, but this&#13;
must be manually entered and is considered unreliable by the CLO's office. Also, this field was not added&#13;
until FY04. The Learning Catalog offers more reliable data on joint sponsorship. Course administrators&#13;
have an incentive to list all VPU fields because the VPUs listed determine when the offering appears in&#13;
searches by participants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
accomplishment under the SLF, so no comparable data are available for joint VPU&#13;
activities under the KLC or previously. An analysis of entries in the Learning Catalog&#13;
shows that the overall percentage of jointly offered learning activities has not changed&#13;
significantly from FY03 (8 percent, or 196 of 2,546 activities) to FY04 (7 percent, or 220&#13;
of 3,298 activities) and FY05 (5 percent, or 150 of 2861 activities) (figure 6).20 However,&#13;
some collaborative arrangements have been formally established within the new learning&#13;
structure, most notably the assignment of a single learning coordinator for both EAP and&#13;
SAR (Asia Learning).&#13;

3.20    According to the Learning Catalog, more than three quarters (77 percent) of&#13;
jointly sponsored events in FY03 reflected collaboration between SLCs or other&#13;
nonregional VPUs--indicating that regional programs were not officially benefiting from&#13;
expertise outside of their regions. The major subset of FY03 collaborations were those&#13;
offered by PREM and DEC together (22 percent). Joint activities between regions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20Events listed with multiple VPUs were not counted if all of the VPUs included were identical.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
occurred only between EAP and SAR (15 percent) through the new structural&#13;
arrangement where they share a single learning coordinator. The remaining collaborative&#13;
activities were offered jointly by SLCs or other VPUs and regions (8 percent).21&#13;
&#13;
3.21      Between FY03 and FY05, there has been a shift towards increased collaboration&#13;
with or among regions. In FY05, regions were involved in half of all joint offerings,&#13;
marking a steady increase over FY04 (43 percent) and FY03 (23 percent).&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures&#13;
&#13;
3.22      The Learning Board has also started to track KPIs related to expenditures for staff&#13;
learning:&#13;
          Â· Staff learning expenditures (on a quarterly basis by VPU);&#13;
          Â· Expenditures for delivering learning as a percentage of salaries; and&#13;
          Â· Learning expenditures as a percentage of administrative budgets.&#13;
&#13;
Current spending levels for staff learning are in line with best practice learning and&#13;
knowledge organizations globally. As shown in table 10, and later in chapter 4 on&#13;
benchmarking, the Bank's investment has exceeded the average ASTD benchmark for&#13;
spending (learning delivery costs at 2.2 percent of salary costs) in all years since the&#13;
Strategic Compact (FY97) (World Bank 2005). Importantly, the Bank's FY05&#13;
investment of 4.1 percent of salary costs matches that of an elite group of 24 ASTD best&#13;
practice organizations, which have a 4.16 percent average. For FY03 through FY05, the&#13;
amount spent on staff learning exceeded the budget allocation--indicating that VPUs&#13;
were willing to dedicate funds from other sources.&#13;

                                                         EVALUATION FINDINGS&#13;
&#13;
3.23    The development and refinement of administrative data systems have supported&#13;
systematic evaluation, with course and participant data available for analytic purposes.&#13;
Program evaluation serves an important function for staff learning in monitoring quality,&#13;
providing formative feedback, and measuring outcomes and impact. Individual VPUs&#13;
can dedicate their own resources to evaluation activities when desired, but WBIEG&#13;
formally serves this role for the Board.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring quality&#13;
&#13;
3.24    As discussed in chapter 2, WBIEG conducts level 1 evaluations to gain&#13;
participants' feedback on course quality. The aggregate ratings for FY05 indicated that&#13;
learning activities were generally of high quality. Nearly all participants from the&#13;
activities sampled assigned favorable ratings for the overall quality (87 percent) and for&#13;
the activities' relevance for the Bank's mission (91 percent). 22 Eighty-seven percent&#13;
assigned favorable ratings for the activities' usefulness for their jobs (figure 7).&#13;

&#13;
3.25    WBIEG uses two standard Likert scale questions in its level 1 questionnaire for&#13;
comparison with ASTD's 2004 benchmarks:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· The mean rating for "my knowledge/skills increased as a result of this&#13;
                                    training" was 4.21, similar to ASTD's benchmark of 4.20,23 and&#13;
&#13;
        Â· The mean rating for "the knowledge/skills gained through this training are&#13;
                                    directly applicable to my job" was 4.16, below ASTD's benchmark of 4.23.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22High ratings include a 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale. The benchmark for quality observed by the Bank is for&#13;
85 percent of respondents to provide high ratings. This benchmark was established prior to the SLF and is&#13;
discussed in appendix B.&#13;
23Mean ratings are based on a 5-point Likert scale: where 1 is "strongly disagree" and 5 is "strongly&#13;
agree."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A baseline at the VPU level for these items was established in FY04 and will be useful&#13;
for gauging progress in the future.&#13;
&#13;
Outcomes and impact&#13;
&#13;
3.26    The Learning Board, SLCs, and regions now routinely use evaluation findings to&#13;
plan improvements. Individual program studies to date have largely concentrated on&#13;
initiatives of the SLCs, a pattern that is not surprising given that these centers were&#13;
specifically designated within the new framework to assign accountability for high-&#13;
priority areas. WBIEG's evaluation findings therefore provide evidence of how the new&#13;
results-driven model is shaping staff learning to link outcomes with business objectives.&#13;
Some key sample areas are presented below to demonstrate how the SLF is&#13;
systematically functioning to address the original challenges identified in the ART&#13;
process in 2001. The examples presented are key initiatives with associated evaluation&#13;
results; many other important programs that have been implemented to address SLF&#13;
priorities are not mentioned in this report.&#13;
&#13;
Management skills&#13;
&#13;
3.27    During FY98, a working group concluded that the Bank needed significant&#13;
changes in leadership competencies "from highly individualistic, overly&#13;
intellectual/technical attitudes with little accountability to competencies for&#13;
interdependent team work, actions for results meeting client needs, a more humble,&#13;
learning-oriented attitude open to gaining knowledge from others, and strengthened&#13;
accountability for quality and resource management" (see World Bank 2000a).&#13;
&#13;
3.28    The ART process identified the need for a managerial learning program as an&#13;
immediate and ongoing priority. In response, Leadership and Organizational&#13;
Effectiveness (HRSLO) and the associated Management SLC have developed a&#13;
curriculum focused on the five M's: managing self, managing others, managing work,&#13;
managing the organization, and managing change. Due to its high priority placed on&#13;
effective leadership skills and behaviors, the Learning Board has requested evaluations of&#13;
most major management learning events, and evaluation findings have informed program&#13;
improvements. Some major initiatives to date and the associated evaluation results&#13;
beyond level 1 are shown in table 11.&#13;
&#13;

                 WBIEG conducted an evaluation on the quality and impact of the individual coaching program, focused&#13;
                 on the 34 participants from 2000-02 (Prom-Jackson et al. 2002a). Ninety-five percent of the 19&#13;
                 respondents rated the quality of coaching services above average or higher; 100 percent would&#13;
&#13;
Results          recommend coaching to other managers; 75 percent indicated that they met their goals of becoming&#13;
                 better managers; and 87 percent rated coaching as an appropriate, effective, and efficient learning&#13;
                 method for managers. The greatest effects of coaching were identified in the areas of managing change,&#13;
                 managing self, and managing others. The study provided recommendations, including that the Bank&#13;
                 should continue to support the program.&#13;

                 WBIEG conducted an evaluation of three sessions of "Communication as Power: Listening, Inquiring,&#13;
                 Feedback," a workshop designed for managers in a new assignment (Zia, Stone, and Palmisano 2003).&#13;
                 Managers reported that they had changed many of their communication behaviors, including consciously&#13;
                 using the skills they had practiced in the workshop. They also reported that these changes improved&#13;
Results          their employees' behavior.&#13;
                 In FY04, the Learning Board reported that limited time and incentives for managers resulted in poor&#13;
                 attendance at workshops. Some workshops were cancelled and others averaged less than 10&#13;
                 participants.&#13;

                 WBIEG conducted an evaluation targeting all course participants from 2001, 2002, and 2003 (Zia and&#13;

&#13;
           WBIEG conducted an evaluation of NMLP by studying three types of data for cohorts 3 and 4: participant&#13;
           feedback (Level 1), feedback from participants three to four months after the program, and feedback from&#13;
           participants' direct reports (Zia, Hanson, and Gunnarson 2004). The study focused on 57 new managers and&#13;
Results    their 675 subordinates. Participants rated Modules 2 and 3 highly. Module 1 was not rated as well. The pre-&#13;
           and post- assessments of new managers by subordinates showed no significant changes. Nearly half (48&#13;
           percent) of the responding managers reported that they could use the skills and knowledge to a limited or&#13;
           considerable extent (4 or 5 on a 5-point scale), and 86 percent recommended the course to other managers.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
3.29    The evolving vision for management learning has focused on four types of&#13;
programs:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Separate core programs for new and experienced managers;&#13;
        Â· Role specific programs--such as peer learning, individual coaching,&#13;
             opportunities for discussion, on-the-job learning, and knowledge sharing;&#13;
&#13;
        Â· External programs--opportunities to attend short, cutting-edge external&#13;
             programs on management and leadership; and&#13;
&#13;
        Â· E-learning--Bank specific (e.g., resource and financial management) and&#13;
             Harvard e-learning (leadership transitions, managing virtual teams, difficult&#13;
             conversations, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
3.30    Many of these programs are now in place--the New Managers' Leadership&#13;
Program, peer learning events for country and sector managers, an individual coaching&#13;
program, and the establishment of an external course facility to name a few. In addition,&#13;
HRSLO has designed a spiral career development model for managers, task team leaders,&#13;
and team members to provide guidance on which learning opportunities to pursue at&#13;
various points in their careers. Other planned initiatives such as a program for&#13;
experienced managers and a Bankwide management forum have been delayed and are&#13;
now being tailored for FY06.&#13;
&#13;
3.31    WBIEG's impact evaluations informed improvements in management learning.&#13;
The overview of learning initiatives for managers presented in this report focuses on&#13;
those of the Management SLC which WBIEG has evaluated, but many other important&#13;
initiatives also exist such as those provided through Client Engagement and Team&#13;
Learning (CET), OPCS, and regions.&#13;
&#13;
Administrative and client support (ACS) skills&#13;
&#13;
3.32    ACS staff play a critical role in supporting effective management and project&#13;
implementation. When the SLF emerged, the key stakeholders understood that shifts in&#13;
learning content must focus not only on managers' behaviors and skills but also on those&#13;
of the support staff. A separate ART process specifically focused on ACS Learning was&#13;
therefore undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
3.33     The major challenge facing the ACS ART was to design a core curriculum that&#13;
would equip ACS staff with the knowledge, skills, and behavior training they need. The&#13;
guiding vision recognized that ACS staff need to contribute in a team environment and to&#13;
support the "office of the future." The development of an effective learning program also&#13;
needed to consider that roughly one half of ACS staff are based in country offices.&#13;
&#13;
3.34    A new agenda for ACS learning emerged from the ART exercise, as reflected in&#13;
box 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   Box 2. The new agenda for ACS staff learning&#13;
&#13;
                 ACS staff would have an improved sense of ownership for their learning agenda&#13;
&#13;
                 A core curriculum would be developed, focused on four areas:&#13;
                       o UnderstandinghowtheBankoperates&#13;
                       o SupportingBankbusinessfromdesktop&#13;
                       o Workinginateam-basedenvironment&#13;
                       o Organizingandtrackingworktasks&#13;
&#13;
                 A road map would be established for ACS learning to provide ACS staff with clear information to&#13;
                 develop their individual learning plans&#13;
&#13;
                 An evaluation and feedback strategy would assess how well ART objectives are being achieved&#13;
&#13;
                 Staff and managers would receive improved communication on ACS learning&#13;
&#13;
                 ACS learning would be a priority in VPU Learning Plans&#13;
&#13;
                 VPU learning committees would include an ACS staff member&#13;
&#13;
                 Clear accountability for ACS learning would be assigned to the ACS SLC and to the ACS Network&#13;
                 Learning Committee&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.35     In accordance with this new agenda, the ACS SLC was established in FY03.&#13;
Notable milestones in ACS learning are presented in table 12.&#13;

&#13;
3.36     To date, the ACS SLC and the Learning Board have worked effectively to meet&#13;
ACS learning objectives. A core curriculum is delivered to ACS staff through events in&#13;
country offices and through streaming video. The ACS SLC has integrated evaluation&#13;
practices to support continuous improvement. ACS learning has been prioritized in VPU&#13;
Learning Plans and, in addition to the ACS SLC, the regions and other VPUs have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             32&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
developed active ACS learning initiatives. In addition, WBIEG evaluated eight sessions&#13;
of "Building Your Skills for Working in a Team-Based Environment" (Bardini,&#13;
Gunnarson, and Palmisano 2003). This study focused on identifying effects on&#13;
workplace skills and behaviors of participating ACS staff. Participants rated the course&#13;
as relevant and useful, and they reported a perceived impact on strengthening ACS work&#13;
relations with Bank staff and clients.&#13;
&#13;
New operational learning&#13;
&#13;
3.37      High-quality Bank operations--particularly the compliance with safeguard and&#13;
fiduciary policies--are needed for the sustainability of development outcomes. Core&#13;
operational knowledge is therefore integral to the success of the Bank's business strategy&#13;
and was identified as an early priority for the SLF. An ongoing priority of the Learning&#13;
Board has been to establish effective operational learning programs for Bank staff. Key&#13;
operational programs include Multisectoral Team Learning, Introduction to Bank&#13;
Operations, and Trust Fund Learning and Accreditation, described below.&#13;
&#13;
Multisectoral team learning (MTL)&#13;
&#13;
3.38      Cross-sectoral and integrative professional skills are needed to identify and&#13;
address global public good priorities and corporate advocacy priorities and to deliver&#13;
cross-sectoral products and services. MTL is the only example of a cross-sectoral&#13;
initiative started under the SLF that has been evaluated in phases to identify outcomes&#13;
and impact.&#13;
&#13;
3.39      The MTL Program was introduced in FY02 to support the Bank's strategic goals&#13;
and the new approaches and lending instruments that recognize poverty as a&#13;
multidimensional problem. The program integrates learning into the operational work of&#13;
teams, rather than training staff in a classroom setting. The teams are responsible for&#13;
work products that cross traditional sectoral boundaries--such as Country Assistance&#13;
Strategies (CAS), Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), and community-driven&#13;
development to name a few. A small group of learning coaches, drawn from operational&#13;
staff and development specialists was established in HRS. Each team was given a&#13;
learning budget and worked with an experienced coach to create a team learning plan&#13;
focused on acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary to complete the team's work&#13;
assignment. An overview of the progression of the MTL Program is shown in table 13.&#13;
&#13;

                   MTL activities)                                           new teams in start-up phase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.40    In many cases, the MTL Program worked with clients and staff together. WBIEG&#13;
evaluated the success of the 29 pilot teams in achieving results, finding that the MTL&#13;
Program had made an important contribution to senior-level discussions on corporate&#13;
learning and team effectiveness (Prom-Jackson et al. 2002b). The evaluation identified&#13;
the key challenge facing the program as scaling up for a sustainable business model that&#13;
could support all operational learning.&#13;
&#13;
3.41    The MTL Program was reshaped in FY04 to address the need to become a&#13;
sustainable business model. The previous level of support was maintained with 40 teams,&#13;
and less intensive support was provided to additional teams to maximize effectiveness&#13;
and efficiency. Examples of this support included:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Training regional staff or MTL "graduates" to serve as learning coaches for&#13;
             other teams.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Working with teams preparing PRSPs or CAS to foster cross-learning among&#13;
             the teams.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Expanding the advisory services available through online resources,&#13;
             guidebooks for key activities such as PRSPs, and a new web-based "help&#13;
             desk" Quickcoach to provide just-in-time guidance for teams.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Tying the MTL Program to team leader workshops.&#13;
&#13;
3.42    The program's name was changed to the TEAMS Program in FY04 to reflect the&#13;
broader scope. Responsibility for the program was also moved into the Process and&#13;
Interaction SLC (renamed the SLC for Client Engagement and Teams), reflecting its&#13;
clear link to client engagement.&#13;
&#13;
3.43    After WBIEG had evaluated the pilot teams, the Learning Board requested two&#13;
additional evaluations of the MTL Program (Quizon 2004; Quizon, Ouchi, and&#13;
Gunnarson 2004). The first one indicated that MTL team-learning practices were&#13;
successful in building and improving multisectoral teams, but the results from a survey of&#13;
task team leaders did not provide evidence that the program improved the quality and&#13;
timeliness of final team outputs or products. The next (Phase III) evaluation indicated&#13;
that the MTL Program improved the overall quality of final Bank documents by about 10&#13;
percent. A team's use of certain program resources (e.g., team/TTL coach, Quality at&#13;
Entry Assessments, etc.) was positively and highly correlated with positive team ratings&#13;
for desirable characteristics, behaviors, and performance. Also, in the instances where&#13;
MTL-orchestrated Bank-client engagements happened, their overall effectiveness and&#13;
impact extended beyond the organized events themselves. Both the Phase II and Phase&#13;
III evaluations for MTL relied on stronger methodology than used previously by&#13;
WBIEG--notably the comparisons between MTL and non-MTL teams and the blind&#13;
review of products from both types.&#13;
&#13;
3.44    Results and comments from the evaluations have been considered in program&#13;
changes over time, particularly informing the efforts to "scale up." In FY05, coaching&#13;
relationships with 30 teams were completed or moved into a flexible arrangement. Five&#13;
thematic coaching/knowledge teams now manage most of the team coaching work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
These themes include CAS, Poverty Reduction Support Credit, Postconflict, Middle&#13;
Income Countries, and HIV/AIDS. A "virtual teams" video was completed in&#13;
collaboration with the Information Support Group (ISG). In the first quarter, three&#13;
regional "Foundations of Team Leadership" were delivered in ECA, AFR and EAP-SAR&#13;
with 57 participants.&#13;
&#13;
Introduction to Bank operations (IBO)&#13;
&#13;
3.45      The Learning Board asked OPCS to develop and deliver an operational core&#13;
curriculum with the first priority a focus on beginning operational skills. A new IBO&#13;
course was piloted in FY02 and rolled out in subsequent years as shown in table 14.&#13;
&#13;
3.46      Effective operational skills are key to achieving business results, and the Learning&#13;
Board has prioritized the evaluation of IBO and the use of results to inform&#13;
improvements. In FY03, WBIEG administered objective multiple-choice tests (level 2)&#13;
to measure learning gains and conducted an impact evaluation (Le Rouzic 2003; Liu&#13;
2003). These studies indicated that learning gains were high, the new knowledge levels&#13;
were maintained three months later, and that these gains were significantly higher than&#13;
those of a matched comparison group of Bank staff who had not taken the course.&#13;
&#13;

 piloted.                                                          interested networks, and OPCS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.47      The Learning Board continues to monitor this program's ability to address staff&#13;
needs. Waiting lists for IBO are long, and the Board reported at the end of FY05 that&#13;
only 34 percent of GE+ Operations staff in the Bank for six years or less had participated&#13;
in an operational learning activity (World Bank 2005). A recent review of the OPCS&#13;
core course found that the learning objectives were not clearly defined in terms of their&#13;
link to business needs and that the pedagogical design was not easily scaled up or&#13;
replicated in its current format. 24 The Learning Board is using these and other findings to&#13;
inform plans for improvements: OPCS has been offered assistance from LSG and funding&#13;
has been provided to develop a new blended IBO--a joint effort of regions, interested&#13;
networks and OPCS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24Jeannette Murray (Human Resources Learning Board), Marsha McGraw Olive (Europe and Central Asia&#13;
Vice President office), and Klaus Tilmes (Operations Evaluation Department Knowledge and Evaluation&#13;
Capacity Development) conducted the review and presented it to the Learning Board on December 17,&#13;
2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Trust fund learning and accreditation program (TLAP)&#13;
&#13;
3.48     TLAP has been an important initiative, demonstrating that high quality,&#13;
interactive e-learning can be successful in the Bank's environment.&#13;
&#13;
3.49     Trust funds are financial arrangements whereby bilateral and other external&#13;
donors provide grants to support the Bank's activities. These grants are used for project&#13;
preparation, technical assistance, advisory services, debt relief, postconflict transition,&#13;
and the cofinancing of investment projects. Bank staff often manage the appropriate use&#13;
of trust funds, and a comprehensive Trust Fund Process Review in FY01 identified the&#13;
need to enhance staff knowledge of the management and applications of trust funds&#13;
(Khattri et al. 2002).&#13;
&#13;
3.50     TLAP was developed in response to the FY01 review and comprises an e-learning&#13;
curriculum with 17 learning modules, a self-assessment test, and a 48-item online&#13;
accreditation exam based on the learning modules. The program was piloted in October&#13;
2002 and improvements recommended by a formative evaluation were implemented&#13;
before the program was launched Bankwide in December 2002. Beginning in FY04,&#13;
only accredited Task Team Leaders are allowed to manage and execute trust funds.&#13;
&#13;
3.51     WBIEG has evaluated TLAP, and results indicate that this is an effective program&#13;
that provides significant learning gains (Khattri et al. 2003; Shi, Khattri, and Han 2004).&#13;
Compliance with trust fund requirements improved after the TLAP was implemented.&#13;
This program has also provided valuable experience with learning accreditation--&#13;
demonstrating how a certification process can be useful where the business needs,&#13;
learning objectives, and knowledge to be acquired are clearly defined.&#13;
&#13;
Metanalyses: What contributes to learning?&#13;
&#13;
3.52     The new learning initiatives and respective evaluation results discussed&#13;
previously provide examples of how the Bank addresses key learning priorities and uses&#13;
results for continuous improvement. These initiatives represent but a few of the major&#13;
staff learning programs--many others have been developed or refined to provide other&#13;
professional and technical skills, address regional needs, and promote innovative learning&#13;
in other areas. Although WBIEG conducts a limited number of impact evaluations each&#13;
year, the group does produce general studies to inform the Bank's learning community&#13;
about what factors contribute to the effectiveness of learning activities.&#13;
&#13;
3.53     As part of the level 1 evaluation process, WBIEG provides an annual review of&#13;
staff learning, reporting on the results from participant feedback and then also conducting&#13;
an analysis of participants within courses to assess whether activity features and&#13;
participants' characteristics are related to quality (Chard, Arango, and Jha 2004).25 In&#13;
FY05, WBIEG reviewed the studies and impact evaluations completed under the SLF to&#13;
date to provide a comprehensive look at what activity features, participant characteristics,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25This analysis uses hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), a statistical modeling procedure that analyzes&#13;
hierarchically nested data such as participants within courses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
work conditions and other factors contribute to effectiveness. Which features are&#13;
effective depends on the objective(s) of the program (Lockheed and Arango 2005).&#13;
&#13;
        Â· For raising awareness, effective features include (a) networking opportunities&#13;
             (sector forums); (b) cutting-edge information (P&amp;T brown bag seminars); and&#13;
             (c) high-priority corporate information (such as wallet cards with the&#13;
             Millennium Development Goals).&#13;
&#13;
        Â· For building staff capabilities, influential factors are (a) content (including&#13;
             relevant case studies and concrete examples); (b) pedagogy; (c) instructor&#13;
             quality; and, (d) sufficient time.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· For building team effectiveness and developing leaders, behavioral changes&#13;
             can occur through action learning (including coaching).&#13;
&#13;
        Â· For achieving operational impact, good learning programs must be combined&#13;
             with institutional support. Key factors include the right participants, follow-&#13;
             up, and supervisory support.&#13;
&#13;
3.54    This study also reported on the pattern of findings compiled by impact evaluations&#13;
on staff learning initiatives to date. Over half the learning programs for which impact&#13;
evaluations have been conducted focused on whether participants used what they learned&#13;
in the program. In all cases, a substantial share of participants reported on-the-job use,&#13;
and in a few cases the use of learning by participants could be compared with the use of&#13;
similar types of knowledge by nonparticipants. In addition, evaluations of three programs&#13;
have confirmed operational impact in terms of compliance, product quality, and quality&#13;
assurance ratings.&#13;
&#13;
3.55    The information about what contributes to effective learning is a valuable&#13;
resource for learning coordinators and course providers, but another important function of&#13;
the study on the features of staff learning that contribute to effectiveness was to examine&#13;
the distribution of impact evaluations under the SLF to date and note the types of&#13;
activities that have not been evaluated thus far. For the new framework to ground&#13;
learning in results, the Learning Board will need to increase the support for evaluation to&#13;
gather more evidence about what works across learning objectives and activity types.&#13;
&#13;
                             SHIFTS IN THE LEARNING CULTURE&#13;
&#13;
3.56    Another major objective of the SLF is to transform the Bank's culture, to improve&#13;
the systemic conditions in which learning takes place. An independent assessment on the&#13;
status of learning in the Bank by the Society for Organizational Learning in FY00&#13;
underscored the need to build trust and promote accountability to foster a positive&#13;
environment for staff learning (Humphries, Hanig, and Senge 2000). Responses to the&#13;
Bank's periodic surveys of staff and interviews with staff conducted for this review&#13;
provide some evidence of how the learning culture has changed since the SLF was&#13;
established.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Findings from the staff survey&#13;
&#13;
3.57       The Learning Board and CLO use data from the staff survey to assess&#13;
improvements in or challenges to the Bank's learning culture over time. One positive&#13;
indicator regarding the culture for staff is the increased response rate to the survey: in&#13;
2003, 83 percent (9,560 staff) responded, compared to 76 percent in 2002, 55 percent in&#13;
1999, and 50 percent in 1997.26 No tangible incentives are offered to staff to complete&#13;
the survey, and the increased response rate reflects the recognition that senior&#13;
management takes the results seriously as being the pulse of organizational health.&#13;
Results from questions related to learning are found in table 15 below.&#13;

&#13;
3.58       Although cross-year comparisons are not possible on new questions, the analysis&#13;
still yields interesting differences across groups in the same year. The Learning Board&#13;
has analyzed these results as part of a larger strategy of continuous improvement. The&#13;
CLO's office examined responses by grade level, gender, location, length of service, and&#13;
other potential independent variables to see what factors influence responses. The&#13;
Learning Board has used these results to identify staff learning needs or trends.&#13;
&#13;
3.59       The Board also reviewed the common themes that emerged in response to the&#13;
open-ended item asking staff to identify one thing that would help them to achieve their&#13;
learning and development goals. Dominant themes were identified by region, and this&#13;
information was used in some cases to pursue regional solutions. For example, staff&#13;
&#13;
26The survey was first administered as a web survey in 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
survey results indicated that ECA staff were divided on learning issues, with country-&#13;
based staff giving more favorable ratings regarding learning opportunities than&#13;
headquarters staff. There were also notable variations among country units. In addition,&#13;
the most frequent write-in among ECA staff was that they needed time and budget to&#13;
improve learning and professional development. This feedback influenced ECA's&#13;
Learning Committee to institute a competition for professional development grants for&#13;
senior specialists in FY05 (World Bank 2004b).&#13;
&#13;
3.60    Asia Learning (East Asia and Pacific and South Asia regions) provided another&#13;
example of how survey results inform plans for improvement. This unit noted that&#13;
"learning is impeded by the current culture where all the incentives lie on the side of&#13;
operational work rather than learning" with EAP-SAR responses stating that the volume&#13;
of the workload was the single largest factor preventing staff from taking advantage of&#13;
the training offered (28 percent of EAP responses and 29 percent of SAR responses)&#13;
(World Bank 2004c). Asia Learning has used staff survey and other data to design a two-&#13;
year action plan focused on learning culture and behavior.&#13;
&#13;
How staff learn&#13;
&#13;
3.61    Twenty-eight Bank staff, nine based in Washington, DC and the remainder in the&#13;
field, were interviewed to provide an understanding of the experiences and perspectives&#13;
of staff. These individuals were not representative of the Bank's overall staff. Learning&#13;
Board members or sector managers recommended them for this study, usually because&#13;
they had been active in formal training.&#13;
&#13;
3.62    Respondents were asked to reflect on how they developed the knowledge and&#13;
skills needed during their current career. Six reported that mentoring, whether formal or&#13;
informal, plays an important role. A majority referred in general to hands-on&#13;
opportunities, indicating that they learn best by doing--either in a formal action-based&#13;
learning event or at their own jobs. Two noted that a help-desk model works well, where&#13;
there is a clearly identified person to call with specific questions as needed.&#13;
&#13;
3.63    A few staff had reflected extensively on how they developed the knowledge and&#13;
skills they needed, and they presented theories about Bank culture or suggestions for&#13;
improvement. One woman observed that staff in networks are academic and learn by&#13;
reading and writing whereas staff in regions are practitioners and learn by talking and&#13;
doing. A sector manager suggested that systemic changes are needed to encourage senior&#13;
specialists to participate in mentoring and knowledge-sharing activities. Illustrative&#13;
comments on how staff learn are in box 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              39&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Box 3. Sample quotes from staff about how they learn&#13;
&#13;
"I have thought about network reform for learning. There needs to be more resourcing of sector gurus.&#13;
These are senior operational people who are 100 percent booked on getting their own projects to the&#13;
board. They need some time allotted for sharing knowledge, giving brown bags for example."&#13;
SAR sector manager&#13;
&#13;
"Rotation or cross-support opportunities are the best--for example, if I could move from energy to&#13;
education. The big problem is to upgrade technical skills, and there needs to be a mechanism to get&#13;
exposure across areas. Since these opportunities are based on your contacts, those in country offices are&#13;
greatly disadvantaged."&#13;
INF financial analyst&#13;
&#13;
"I need access to experts. These need to be personal contacts so I am comfortable if I need to ask silly&#13;
questions. This is a problem especially for country officers because we are very isolated and do not have&#13;
that kind of proximity to our colleagues in Washington."&#13;
LCR country officer&#13;
&#13;
"We learn best with clients. The Bank should draw on local resources. Perhaps have 80 percent of us and&#13;
20 percent of the client [together in learning events], especially government agencies. This is a great way&#13;
for us to understand them and for them to understand us."&#13;
EAP PSD senior specialist&#13;
&#13;
"I learn best if I already need to know something. Then I can take the skills and immediately apply them.&#13;
Really, informal situations are better where a colleague can help me."&#13;
OPCS ACS staff member&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.64      Overall, few of those interviewed reported that they tended to learn the skills and&#13;
knowledge they needed through formal learning events. IT specialists were an exception,&#13;
however, in that they emphasized the value of attending formal training to maintain up-&#13;
to-date skills.&#13;
&#13;
Incentives for participating in formal learning opportunities&#13;
&#13;
3.65      Staff were also asked to identify what factors motivated them to participate in&#13;
formal learning opportunities, and sample responses are in box 4. By far, the most&#13;
common reason cited was that a colleague had taken a course and subsequently&#13;
recommended it. Staff in the field also expressed a strong motivation to learn more about&#13;
Bank operations--although in some cases they had been unable to enroll in desired&#13;
courses because they were full.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Box 4. Sample comments on incentives for staff to participate in learning&#13;
opportunities&#13;
&#13;
"I was suddenly speaking for the Bank, so I needed to know about the Bank. This was a big incentive."&#13;
LCR senior public sector specialist&#13;
&#13;
"The Bank is changing the way we operate. That really requires huge skills changes. I am very motivated,&#13;
but it needs to be compulsory for all to go through these trainings." EAP senior poverty economist&#13;
&#13;
"The Bank has done a lot in matching supply and demand. I go to increase my capacity and also to interact&#13;

3.66       Several of those in the field were motivated to attend sector weeks because they&#13;
provided a rare opportunity to network with others in their region or area of technical&#13;
expertise. Field staff saw these as important opportunities and noted that the learning&#13;
events had become more sophisticated over time. However, in cases where sector weeks&#13;
had been condensed--to two-day events for example--staff observed that they were no&#13;
longer worth the travel time.&#13;
&#13;
3.67       Staff tended to describe a positive learning culture where they often felt&#13;
encouraged to seek learning opportunities or viewed it as their responsibility. Those who&#13;
had worked in the Bank for many years reflected that there were many more appropriate&#13;
learning opportunities now than there had been a few years ago.&#13;
&#13;
Barriers to formal learning opportunities&#13;
&#13;
3.68       Respondents noted that the most common factor discouraging them from&#13;
participating in learning events was that they could not identify an appropriate event to&#13;
attend. In some cases, the Learning Catalog confused or overwhelmed staff. Those in&#13;
headquarters also reported being overwhelmed by e-mails announcing training, whereas&#13;
those in the field relied heavily on e-mail to learn about what opportunities were&#13;
available. Some individuals suggested the need for a designated learning advisor or some&#13;
other interactive system where one could find appropriate events.27 Illustrative quotes on&#13;
barriers for learning are in box 5.&#13;

"It is frustrating to find training. For example, I want an overview of procurement, but I don't want to do&#13;
procurement. If I type that in as my key word, it is impossible to sort through and figure out what I want.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.69       Some of those in headquarters also indicated that it was unrealistic to hold all-day&#13;
training sessions and expect people to stay throughout. One individual observed that he&#13;
could not ignore calls from clients while learning how to behave better towards them. In&#13;
contrast, those in the field asserted that they could not travel to Washington for a short&#13;
&#13;

27 Current initiatives of the Knowledge and Learning Environment (KLE)--including the new Learning&#13;
Management System in general and learning roadmaps in particular--are expected to address these&#13;
problems.&#13;

                  SUMMARY OF PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SLF OBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
3.70     This chapter provides some indication of how well the SLF is achieving its&#13;
objectives. More important, the chapter provides concrete evidence and many examples&#13;
of how a systemic change has occurred, with a centralized feedback loop to support and&#13;
monitor decentralized learning activities and ground learning in results over time.&#13;
Recommendations to improve progress are provided in chapter 5.&#13;
&#13;
3.71     Learning Objectives: From "Build Technical Excellence" to "Build Capacity to&#13;
Create Results." This overarching concept--building staff capacity--encompasses all of&#13;
the other SLF objectives. Evaluation findings show that participants in learning&#13;
activities use what they learned in their jobs. However, several types of activities have&#13;
not yet been evaluated and many of the studies completed have relied on self-reported&#13;
data on learning impact. Additional evidence on progress towards this objective is likely&#13;
to accrue as evaluation practices continue to evolve and lessons learned from studies&#13;
guide program design and improvement.&#13;
&#13;
3.72     Content Focus: From "Professional Sectoral Skills" to "More Behavior,&#13;
Integrative, Operational and Managerial Skills." The CLO and Learning Board have&#13;
prioritized the development of programs to address needs identified in the original ART&#13;
exercise, launching and redesigning many programs since the start of the SLF. In some&#13;
cases, evaluations have shown these initiatives to have learning or operational impact.&#13;
The feedback loop of the new framework regularly monitors new activities and highlights&#13;
challenges when needed. Current examples include the undersupply of appropriate&#13;
learning opportunities to develop core operational skills and the continuing need for an&#13;
effective, cohesive strategy for developing managers. The Learning Board discusses&#13;
such challenges and plans strategies to increase effectiveness, facilitating further progress&#13;
toward this objective.&#13;
&#13;
3.73     Learner Focus: From "Individual HQ Staff" to "More Teams, Country Office&#13;
Staff, and Joint Client/Staff Teams." Progress in shifting away from individual&#13;
headquarters staff is still in the beginning stages: administrative data do not yet show&#13;
significant increases in team-based learning, participation of country office staff, or joint&#13;
client/staff activities. However, the CLO and Learning Board have encouraged and&#13;
facilitated progress towards this objective. Examples include setting a target (20 percent)&#13;
for activities that must be accessible to country office staff, establishing a new&#13;
administrative data system to improve the tracking of team-based and country office&#13;
activities, offering joint staff-client activities such as the Innovativeness and&#13;
Competitiveness Workshop Series and Regional Seminar on Bank Insolvency for EAP,&#13;
and spotlighting best practices such as the MTL Program and regional initiatives among&#13;
others.&#13;
&#13;
3.74     Pedagogy: From "Classroom Learning" to "New Forms of Pedagogy (e.g., peer&#13;
learning, action learning, e-learning)." Administrative data systems also do not yet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 42&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
show significant increases in the use of new forms of pedagogy as an overall percentage&#13;
of learning activities. New innovative programs--both formal and informal--might be&#13;
underreported due to data issues. Measurable progress in this area is likely to occur with&#13;
the launch of the KLE (and more accurate tracking of e-learning in particular), increased&#13;
support from LSG, and formative guidance from successful programs such as TLAP.&#13;
&#13;
3.75   Structure: From "Little Accountability, Learning Silos" to&#13;
Ownership/Accountability Demand driven, Cross-Boundary." The SLF has established&#13;
SLCs to clarify accountability for high-priority content areas and moved resources to the&#13;
regions to respond to staff learning needs. The process for developing learning plans&#13;
requires learning coordinators and VPUs to strategize for effective resource use (rather&#13;
than the previous "just use or lose" approach), and the Learning Board brings VPUs&#13;
together for dialogue as a corporate learning community. These pieces of the framework&#13;
provide the foundation for breaking down the supply silos of the previous system. Data&#13;
from FY03-05 on learning activities do not show an increase in overall joint VPU&#13;
offerings, but there has been a steady shift towards increased Bank region collaboration&#13;
on joint client-staff activities. In addition, WBIEG is examining cross-sectoral learning at&#13;
the Bank, identifying best practices, and recommending improvements to better align&#13;
offerings with business needs (Shi, Cao, and Yang 2005).&#13;
&#13;
3.76   Culture: From "Side Line, I Don't Have Time!" to "Business Line, Learning&#13;
Matters!" Results from the staff survey and interviews with staff and sector managers&#13;
indicate that learning is valued within the Bank's culture and is perceived as important&#13;
for achieving business objectives. In addition, the learning plan and quarterly review&#13;
process sends a clear signal to VPUs that learning activities should be strategically linked&#13;
to work plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                             4.        BENCHMARKING&#13;
&#13;
4.1     Staff decentralization, diversification of learning technologies, and changing&#13;
corporate priorities all present challenges for efforts to "benchmark" staff learning. This&#13;
chapter compares the Bank's SLF with staff learning in other organizations, focusing on&#13;
both standard benchmarks and new indicators. With respect to both, the Bank's SLF is at&#13;
the leading edge of the industry.&#13;
&#13;
4.2     The World Bank is ahead of the benchmark for staff learning in terms of&#13;
organization, leadership, and evaluation. The Bank is comparable to benchmark&#13;
organizations for alignment of staff learning with business needs, learning targets,&#13;
process for budget allocations to staff learning, average expenditures, and implementation&#13;
of a LMS. The Bank appears to be below the benchmark for the use of technology in&#13;
learning.&#13;
&#13;
4.3     The principal organization that benchmarks staff learning, ASTD, provides a&#13;
number of key indicators in its annual state of the industry report; most of these&#13;
indicators focus on traditional practices while others adjust on an annual basis in response&#13;
to changes in the industry. ASTD's "benchmarking service" regularly collects data from&#13;
a volunteer sample of about 350 U.S. organizations (the BMS benchmarking group),&#13;
from about 25 large Fortune 500 companies and public sector organizations (the BMF&#13;
benchmarking group) and from about 25 organizations that were "honored for their&#13;
exceptional efforts to foster, support and leverage enterprise-side learning for business&#13;
results" (the BEST benchmarking group) (Sugrue and Kim 2004). ASTD selects the&#13;
BEST organizations according to evidence: (a) that learning has value in the culture; (b)&#13;
of a link between learning and performance; (c) that the organization has leveraged&#13;
technology in learning; and, (d) of innovative learning initiatives. ASTD does not provide&#13;
information regarding the nature of this evidence, but does summarize eight&#13;
characteristics of BEST learning organizations (see Appendix D).&#13;
&#13;
4.4     To supplement data from ASTD, this review included formal interviews with six&#13;
large and decentralized organizations (the B-6 group), as well as within the World Bank,&#13;
to explore topics not covered by standard benchmarks. These findings were supplemented&#13;
with (a) a study of how 72 organizations across 11 countries evaluate their learning&#13;
programs and (b) other recent relevant literature (KnowledgeAdvisors 2004). This&#13;
chapter is not a comprehensive benchmarking study that addresses all the issues that&#13;
affect staff learning; rather it is tailored to the specific interests of the Learning Board.&#13;
&#13;
                              ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP&#13;
&#13;
4.5      Large international organizations typically develop learning programs that&#13;
support staff in bureaucratically and geographically decentralized locations and that are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
aligned with overall corporate goals and priorities. The World Bank has responded to this&#13;
challenge by establishing the SLF.&#13;
&#13;
4.6      Most of the BEST benchmarking organizations have the functional equivalent of&#13;
the CLO, although only two of the B-6 organizations report having such a position (the&#13;
UNDP and the Bank of America) (table 16). Several of the B-6 organizations have, in&#13;
addition, the functional equivalent of the Bank's Knowledge and Learning Board, whose&#13;
members typically represent various "lines of business," functional units or sectors.&#13;
These boards typically serve an oversight and coordination function. Some adjudicate&#13;
learning priorities across units, but none have responsibility for allocating budgets for&#13;
learning programs, which is delegated to the CLOs.&#13;

                                      BUSINESS ALIGNMENT&#13;
&#13;
4.7      Most organizations, including the World Bank, are still determining the structures&#13;
and procedures that enable learning to be aligned with business needs. Most have&#13;
rationales for expenditures on learning that emphasize the contribution of learning to core&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
business goals, and success as a learning organization is often expressed as learning&#13;
aligned with business needs.&#13;
&#13;
4.8      The ASTD BEST organizations, in recognizing the importance of aligning&#13;
learning and business, have developed formal processes to align short- and long-term&#13;
business strategies with competency, learning, and performance needs and priorities. In&#13;
addition, they have mapped learning resources to competencies, individual development&#13;
plans, jobs, and corporate goals.&#13;
&#13;
4.9      The B-6 organizations note the importance of aligning learning with business. The&#13;
multilateral donor institutions seem to emphasize individual skills and competencies,&#13;
while the private sector organizations stress corporate objectives.              28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  INVESTMENT AND BUDGET PROCESSES&#13;
&#13;
4.10     Decisionmaking methods vary for how learning organizations invest in learning.&#13;
Some organizations follow historical precedents, basing proposed investments on past&#13;
budgets or past attendance at learning events while others respond to proposed&#13;
investments based on current needs and skills assessments. Other organizations appear to&#13;
have arbitrary methods. Consequently, considerable variation in the efficiency of these&#13;
investments can occur, and average expenditures may not provide suitable benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
4.11     Nevertheless, total spending per employee and share of learning in the corporate&#13;
budget are two indicators that are widely available, even though they do not necessarily&#13;
represent best practice. Table 17 presents comparative expenditures for the most recent&#13;
years; data were available for only two of the B-6, and are not reported.&#13;

&#13;
4.12     In terms of the share of the payroll, the BEST organizations spent, on average,&#13;
approximately twice as much as either BMS or BMF organizations. In terms of per-&#13;
employee expenditure, however, BEST organizations spent two and one-half times the&#13;
&#13;
28For example, IDB wants to allow staff to grow professionally, to better respond to country demands and&#13;
better influence country outcomes, while PriceWaterhouseCoopers wants learning units to be seen as&#13;
strategic partners and "financial players," with learning aligned to drive human capital and culture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
BMS average and nearly twice the BMF average. Some spent less on training than the&#13;
norm, but the BEST organizations maximized the efficiency of the learning organization&#13;
by centralization, internal process improvement, use of technology, and strategic&#13;
outsourcing. Only two of the B-6 organizations provided information on their annual&#13;
learning budget, so comparisons cannot be made with this group.&#13;
&#13;
4.13     Processes in budget allocation varied across the B-6 organizations, ranging from&#13;
the comparatively simple to the comparatively complex. For multilateral donor agencies,&#13;
for example, simplicity is reported for the IMF, where the HR department proposes an&#13;
annual budget with a business case justification and the IMF Office of Budget and&#13;
Planning allocates the funds. By comparison, the UNDP reported that many people are&#13;
involved in decisions and that there are many conditions for budget decisions. Private-&#13;
sector organizations are both centralized, for example with the office of the chief&#13;
financial officer of PriceWaterhouseCoopers managing the overall budget, and&#13;
decentralized, for example with each line of business making its own decisions at the&#13;
Bank of America. The World Bank's process for allocating resources for learning has&#13;
evolved over the past several years and is described in chapter 2.&#13;
&#13;
                                           LEARNING TARGETS&#13;
&#13;
4.14     Targets for learning cover budgets, delivery, effectiveness, efficiency, and impact.&#13;
ASTD does not report targets for its benchmarking groups, and two of the B-6&#13;
organizations noted that they do not set targets. Other B-6 interviews showed a range of&#13;
noncomparable targets. For example, two organizations mentioned learning expenditure&#13;
targets, four organizations mentioned satisfaction targets, two organizations mentioned&#13;
types of delivery targets (e-learning versus traditional classroom; lectures versus&#13;
seminars) and two organizations mentioned hours of learning targets. None of the B-6&#13;
mentioned setting targets in all areas.&#13;
&#13;
4.15     The World Bank reports six KPIs for learning but has not set specific targets for&#13;
them.29 The CLO's office monitors these indicators. In addition, existing databases and&#13;
the LMS should allow monitoring of the types of alternative delivery strategies (e.g., e-&#13;
learning, blended learning, team-based learning) and their comparative effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
                                    TECHNOLOGY AND REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
4.16     Learning organizations use technology in three important ways (a) to deliver&#13;
learning, (b) to monitor this delivery, and (c) to integrate both through learning&#13;
management systems (LMS). The ASTD benchmarking organizations provide important&#13;
information on the first, while the B-6 organizations are informative on the second and on&#13;
the LMS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29These indicators are: (a) share of staff participating in at least one learning activity over the past 12&#13;
months; (b) share of regional staff participating in at least two learning activities over the past 12 months;&#13;
(c) expenditures on staff learning; (d) expenditures on the delivery of staff learning as a share of staff&#13;
salaries and benefits; (e) learning expenditures as a share of administrative budget; and (f) share of courses&#13;
with average rating of 4 or better on level 1 evaluations.&#13;
&#13;

Types of learning opportunities&#13;
&#13;
4.17      Most organizations use multiple approaches to design and deliver learning&#13;
activities. ASTD now tracks seven types of delivery methods, which we summarized into&#13;
three main categories for purposes of comparison with the World Bank. Table 18 shows a&#13;
comparison of delivery methods.&#13;

aWorld Bank activities were categorized in the following manner: Exclusively Classroom - brown bag lunch, clinic,&#13;
conference, course, sector week, seminar, and workshop; Exclusively Technology Â­ online; Blended Â­ videoconference;&#13;
and, Other - coaching/mentoring, meeting, retreat, study tour, and team-based learning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.18      The share of technology-based learning in all learning is growing among&#13;
benchmark organizations, but the progress is not as rapid at the Bank. The BMS&#13;
organizations show an increase from 8 percent of learning hours provided by technology&#13;
in 1999 to 24 percent in 2003 (Sugrue and Kim 2004). In 2004, the BEST organizations&#13;
reported 29 percent of learning hours provided through technology. In comparison, the&#13;
World Bank offers 5 percent of its formal learning activities through technology. Of&#13;
those technology-based learning activities in the Bank, most are for IT topics, with ISG&#13;
offering 71 percent (96 of 137) of e-learning activities in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
4.19      Desk-top computing linked with the internet means that, as one CEO explained,&#13;
"The chief knowledge officer right now in many companies is Google" (Bingham and&#13;
Galagan 2005). The internet is leveraged as the "knowledge system" more and more.&#13;
The World Bank's knowledge site is available both internally and externally.&#13;
&#13;
4.20      The sharpest distinction between the BEST organizations and the other ASTD&#13;
benchmarking organizations is in their use of "blended" learning, which combines live&#13;
instructor-led learning with on-line and remote learning. For example, at IBM, staff take&#13;
courses that "seamlessly" involve web-based and face-to-face elements (Davenport&#13;
2005).While accounting for only 1 percent of learning activities for staff in FY05, the&#13;
World Bank's experience with blended learning for clients is extensive and uses&#13;
primarily distance learning through videoconference centers located in most country&#13;
offices and through the Bank-sponsored Global Development Learning Network&#13;
(GDLN). Opportunities exist for the Bank's staff learning programs to exploit the Bank's&#13;
videoconference networks.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Learning management systems and training scorecards&#13;
&#13;
4.21     LMSs incorporate a range of functions into a single unified database, and several&#13;
off-the-shelf LMSs are available.30 Most B-6 organizations recognized the need to have a&#13;
system that both provides a "portal" for staff learning and monitors learning delivery,&#13;
participation and costs. Such systems are only in the early stages of introduction, and&#13;
successes are coming from off-the-shelf systems.31 These need modifications to meet&#13;
specific organizational needs. To promote "one-stop shopping" for learning for staff, the&#13;
World Bank purchased an off-the-shelf system, which was customized and implemented&#13;
in August 2005, replacing the "home-grown" learning catalog system.&#13;
&#13;
4.22     Training scorecards, which link learning to performance and performance to&#13;
business, are used partially in several of the B-6 organizations. While the World Bank&#13;
does not use a training scorecard, the Bank's KPIs are similar to what other organizations&#13;
considered as part of a training scorecard. For example, several organizations track&#13;
participation and other quantitative indicators, and others have "incomplete" scorecards&#13;
(for management programs only, for example). Only the U.S. defense agency reported&#13;
having a balanced scorecard.32&#13;
&#13;
                                        EVALUATION STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
4.23     Evaluation of staff learning has been dominated by the "Kirkpatrick 4-level"&#13;
evaluation, recently extended to a 5-level system to incorporate measures of "returns on&#13;
investment" (Kirkpatrick 1998 and Phillips 2003). ASTD regularly reports on both the&#13;
share of organizations undertaking evaluations at the four levels, as well as the average&#13;
ratings of learning across benchmarking organizations. B-6 organizations also provided&#13;
information on their use of the 5-levels evaluation approach (table 19).&#13;

&#13;
30In one B-6 organization, a new LMS replaced at least 17 nonintegrated systems.&#13;
31For example, the Bank of America's off-the-shelf LMS includes 191,000 employees, with the only&#13;
difficulty reported being "learning how to utilize all its functionality." Cingular Wireless provides another&#13;
example of the successful implementation of an off-the-shelf LMS, which consolidated multiple existing&#13;
training systems. Only 29 enhancements were made to the off-the-shelf system, and 34,000 users were live&#13;
on the system on the first day, with full implementation within 100 days.&#13;
32The balanced scorecard is a management and measurement system that consists of four categories Â­&#13;
financial performance, customer knowledge, internal business processes, and learning and growth. It is&#13;
meant to help organizations guide current performance and target future performance measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.24      The World Bank's evaluation practice is in line with the BMS organizations and&#13;
ahead of the three multilateral development agencies in the B-6 group. Three-quarters of&#13;
the BMS organizations collect data on participants' responses to training (level 1), while&#13;
only a third assess learning gains (level 2), 14 percent examine transfer of learning to job&#13;
(level 3), and 8 percent attempt to link learning to corporate outcomes (level 4). Data&#13;
were not available regarding level 5 evaluations. By comparison, WBIEG conducts all&#13;
four levels of evaluation, as described in chapter 2.&#13;
&#13;
4.25      The B-6 organizations described their overall strategy for evaluating training, how&#13;
they determined which activities should be evaluated, where the evaluation function is&#13;
housed in the organization, and what their provisions are for independent evaluation. All&#13;
B-6 organizations use level 1 evaluations, and most apply these to all learning offerings&#13;
with a standardized form. None of the multilateral donor organizations reported using&#13;
level 2 tests to measure learning, but the private sector organizations reported using tests&#13;
for half or more of their courses. Only one of the multilateral donor organizations&#13;
evaluates changes in participants' behavior, and this is done only on a pilot basis. Level&#13;
3 evaluations are used in a higher share of the private-sector organizations. Aside from&#13;
the World Bank, none of the multilateral donor organizations use either level 4 or level 5&#13;
evaluations, while all three of the private-sector organizations do for about 25 percent of&#13;
courses. Level 5 evaluations are rare, with no use of this method among the multilateral&#13;
donor agencies and only limited use in private-sector organizations.&#13;
&#13;
4.26      The quasi-independence of the World Bank's learning evaluation function is&#13;
unique. Most organizations include evaluation in the design effort or locate it within the&#13;
line of business. Among the B-6 organizations, only the U.S. defense agency has a stand-&#13;
alone group, which has six full-time professionals dedicated to evaluation. However, this&#13;
unit does not carry out independent evaluations but instead provides templates, standards&#13;
and processes to the curriculum managers to conduct their own self-evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
4.27      A recent study surveyed 72 organizations from 11 countries in 17 industries to&#13;
identify practices in evaluating learning programs (KnowledgeAdvisors 2004). This&#13;
study did not look at evaluation practices from a technical perspective in terms of&#13;
evaluation design, reliability, and validity of instruments, or complexity of analysis. It&#13;
focused instead on other dimensions, and the World Bank compares favorably to the&#13;
organizations summarized in this study with respect to evaluation processes, organization&#13;
and budget, and communication of results (table 20).&#13;

4.28       Return on investment (level 5) has received considerable attention in the staff&#13;
learning literature, with increasing use reported for measuring returns to staff learning&#13;
(Phillips 1994 though 2005, Phillips 2002). Valid inferences regarding returns to&#13;
education investments require valid data on costs of learning. For the World Bank, such&#13;
detailed cost information at the "course" level has not been available, but WBIEG is&#13;
conducting a study on this topic. Benefit-cost analysis also requires monetized&#13;
information regarding outcomes. Where outcomes are not regularly monetized,&#13;
inferences must be made.&#13;
&#13;
                                              EMERGING AREAS&#13;
&#13;
4.29       Five new areas are emerging in the management of staff learning, but&#13;
benchmarking data are not yet available. The World Bank is exploring all of these new&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
4.30       Self-service Learning. Self-service learning automates learning business&#13;
processes and puts the staff in charge of their individual development (Van Dam 2005).&#13;
Staff members take online assessments that result in reports on training needs, which&#13;
automatically identify specific learning opportunities that meet staff members'&#13;
requirements. Learning programs are organized in easily accessible online curricula,&#13;
which might be mapped to a competence model. Staff members autonomously (or in&#13;
consultation with their manager) develop and maintain their learning plans online. Some&#13;
organizations create "learning portals" designed to offer users with a single consistent&#13;
interface Â­ tailored by job role Â­ to provide content, applications, business processes and&#13;
people, anytime. Because portals can be available throughout the organization, providing&#13;
on-demand learning is a strategic way to maintain consistency across the business, a key&#13;
reason why the Bank is making an investment in the LMS (Vona and Granelli 2005).&#13;
&#13;
4.31       Performance Support Tools. This term covers a range of tools typically available&#13;
electronically and often embedded in other tools. Performance support systems provide&#13;
access to specific information needed to perform a task, are used while engaged in doing&#13;
the task, and can be accessed whenever the need arises (Bersin and O'Leonard 2005).&#13;
The objective is often to provide a standard type of support to geographically dispersed&#13;
staff. Recent evaluations indicate that certain types of performance support tools are cost-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
effective, particularly in reducing calls to help desks and reducing the duration of training&#13;
programs.33 At the World Bank, TLAP employs a performance support system, as does&#13;
the "Money Matters" course that LSG and HRSLO deliver together.&#13;
&#13;
4.32    Outsourcing. This term applies to: (a) the traditional use of vendor services, (b)&#13;
the outsourcing of training technology (LMS, e-learning content development, content&#13;
integration, and the hosting of complex LMS and learning content management system&#13;
software); and (c) the outsourcing of business processes, which includes help desks,&#13;
vendor management, classroom administration and the training personnel themselves.&#13;
Forty to 60 percent of learning organizations use traditional vendor services. Research&#13;
suggests that this number will hold steady in the future. The area of huge growth is the&#13;
outsourcing of training technology. Forty-seven percent of companies surveyed in a&#13;
study conducted by a research advisory firm use hosted LMS services, and 70 percent&#13;
used hosted services for other learning technologies, such as virtual classrooms, content&#13;
management or collaboration (Bersin 2005). Far fewer companies do full business&#13;
process outsourcing. The World Bank uses the first two types extensively and has&#13;
outsourced certain learning opportunities in the third category.&#13;
&#13;
4.33    Impact Evaluation. In evaluation, metrics tied to the efficiency of learning&#13;
delivery and the effectiveness and impact of learning on performance are gaining&#13;
emphasis compared to metrics related to participant satisfaction. This change requires&#13;
new and better evaluation methodologies, including formal impact evaluations such as&#13;
those currently conducted in the World Bank for high-priority learning programs.&#13;
Improved data on staff learning costs will also permit more rigorous analyses of the rates&#13;
of return to learning.&#13;
&#13;
4.34    Training scorecards are being used to link learning to performance and&#13;
performance to business, by providing data that stakeholders at all levels can understand.&#13;
At present, the World Bank's performance management systems track only some of six&#13;
dimensions tracked by the ASTD BEST group (table 21).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
33For example, a large U.S. computer manufacturer deployed a "mentor performance support system" and&#13;
found that help desk calls were 35 percent below what they had predicted. DuPont estimates its&#13;
performance support system eliminated 500 help desk calls per week for a savings of at least $750,000 a&#13;
year. Aetna Insurance was able to cut its 13-week instructor-led training course for newly hired employees&#13;
by two weeks through the use of a performance support tool.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
4.35    The Bank's SLF is generally comparable to staff learning in the benchmarking&#13;
organizations discussed in this chapter. In two areas, the World Bank appears to be on the&#13;
leading edge. In five areas the Bank is comparable to the other organizations and in one&#13;
area the Bank needs to improve. See figure 8.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.36    The World Bank is ahead of the benchmark for aspects of organization and&#13;
leadership of staff learning and for its evaluation of staff learning. The organization and&#13;
leadership of staff learning in the Bank provides for central decisionmaking and&#13;
monitoring of learning while being responsive to the decentralized nature of the&#13;
organization. This structure was observed in only one of the B-6 organizations. The&#13;
quasi-independent evaluation unit that provides evaluation services to the World Bank's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Learning Board is unique among the organizations studied. It is also unique among the&#13;
multilateral development agencies conducting outcome and impact evaluations, and&#13;
unique among organizations generally in the impact evaluation designs used. When&#13;
systems for clarifying staff learning costs at the activity level are in place, WBIEG will&#13;
be able to undertake empirical benefit-cost analyses of staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
4.37    The World Bank is comparable to benchmark organizations with respect to&#13;
alignment of staff learning with business needs, learning targets, process for budget&#13;
allocations to staff learning, average expenditures, and implementation of a LMS. The&#13;
World Bank is among the majority of organizations that seek to have learning programs&#13;
aligned with core business goals. Like other organizations, the processes for ensuring&#13;
alignment are under development. Most organizations examined set targets for some&#13;
dimensions of learning, but the World Bank does not have formal targets. However, the&#13;
Bank monitors KPIs that other organizations list as their targets. Decisions for budget&#13;
allocations for learning are made centrally in the multilateral development agencies&#13;
examined and delegated to "lines of business" in the private-sector organizations. The&#13;
World Bank blends these two approaches with centralized decisions regarding the size of&#13;
the budget and decentralized decisions regarding allocations within this budget.&#13;
Measured as a percent of payroll, World Bank resources allocated for learning appear to&#13;
be on target with benchmark organizations. Finally, like most other organizations&#13;
examined, the World Bank is in the process of implementing a learning management&#13;
system that will integrate a number of existing functions related to staff learning and&#13;
provide a "learning portal" for staff to readily access learning.&#13;
&#13;
4.38    The World Bank appears to be below the benchmark for the use of technology in&#13;
learning. The World Bank has some innovative uses of technology in learning delivery&#13;
such as the e-learning in TLAP. However, the Bank delivers only 5 percent of all staff&#13;
learning activities through technology and uses a blended approach for only 1 percent.&#13;
Although the World Bank has identified using technology for learning as a priority, it&#13;
currently falls short in this area.&#13;

       5.      CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
5.1     Like the learning agendas pursued by the LLC and the KLC, the SLF prescribes&#13;
learning that is demand driven, aligned with business results, supported through&#13;
"alternative modes" or new forms of pedagogy, and systematically monitored and&#13;
evaluated. The ART conducted in 2001 that laid the groundwork for the SLF was&#13;
designed with the recognition that previous systems had not been effective in achieving&#13;
the needed results. The resulting framework therefore represents a systemic change from&#13;
previous arrangements for staff learning, and the first phase has focused on&#13;
implementation: defining a new structure to support demand driven decentralized&#13;
learning, establishing reliable administrative data systems, instituting review processes,&#13;
and evaluating programs to identify results.&#13;
&#13;
5.2     The scope of this study did not allow for a VPU-level analysis of how well&#13;
learning is linked to business objectives under the SLF; however, the findings presented&#13;
throughout this report do highlight key accomplishments and issues to guide future&#13;
changes. The central hypothesis of this review is that the SLF has led to improvements in&#13;
the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of staff learning for the Bank as an institution.&#13;
This hypothesis is based on a series of assumptions related to the governance, resource&#13;
management, design and delivery, and evaluation of staff learning. This final chapter&#13;
examines some of these assumptions in light of the issues discussed previously and&#13;
presents recommendations to strengthen Bank staff learning in the future.&#13;
&#13;
                                       GOVERNANCE&#13;
&#13;
5.3     The SLF reflects major organizational changes including the appointment of a&#13;
CLO and the establishment of a Board to govern staff learning. The CLO, in consultation&#13;
with the Knowledge and Learning Board, is accountable for promoting the effective and&#13;
efficient use of resources to equip staff with the skills, knowledge, and behaviors needed&#13;
to achieve the desired business results. While the new organizational structure has been&#13;
successfully instituted, the findings of this review raise questions about three key&#13;
assumptions:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Assumption 1. The Staff Learning Framework has clearly defined objectives&#13;
             with corresponding indicators. The Learning Board is accountable for the&#13;
             success of the new framework, but successful staff learning for the Bank has&#13;
             not been clearly defined. The current SLF objectives reflect priorities rather&#13;
             than measurable targets. To date, the Learning Board has gauged success by&#13;
             tracking the launch of new initiatives and staff participation in priority areas&#13;
             and associated evaluation results where available.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Assumption 2. The roles and responsibilities for establishing the overall&#13;
             strategy and policies for staff learning are clearly defined. Stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               55&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            expressed confusion about their roles as Board members and concern about&#13;
            the Board's ability to function as a decisionmaking body given its size and&#13;
            composition. In addition, some stakeholders reflected that the lack of clear&#13;
            roles and presence of competing interests led to conflict during Board&#13;
            meetings.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Assumption 3. The process for setting learning policy and making other&#13;
            decisions related to governance is clearly defined. Interviews revealed&#13;
            disagreement about how voting rights are assigned to VPUs and how the&#13;
            work plan and meeting agendas for the Learning Board are established.&#13;
            Board members were uncertain about when decisions would occur through a&#13;
            Board vote and when they would simply be made by the CLO.&#13;
&#13;
5.4     The SLF continues to evolve and to enact structural changes. Starting in FY06,&#13;
the Learning Board has been replaced with the Knowledge and Learning Board.&#13;
Stakeholders expect the composition of the new board to resolve some current issues&#13;
such as uneven member profiles and competing interests given the requirement that&#13;
members be at a senior level (salary grade GH or above) and the appointment of a&#13;
governing council for corporate policy and strategy issues. Roles, responsibilities, and&#13;
procedures have been drafted for the new Board that should clarify processes for setting&#13;
meeting agendas and establishing new policies. However, these new terms of reference&#13;
have not yet been approved despite efforts to do so.&#13;
&#13;
5.5     Findings from this review are likely to be useful to the new Knowledge and&#13;
Learning Board as it continues to institute changes. The top priority of the KLB should&#13;
be to address challenges related to governance. Suggestions to make the governance of&#13;
staff learning more effective and cohesive (without centralizing additional functions)&#13;
include:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Establish a definition of success for staff learning at the Bank against which&#13;
            to gauge progress. In keeping with the Bank's decentralized structure,&#13;
            objectives may vary by VPU according to different lines of business.&#13;
            However, policies and plans for staff learning should be driven by concrete&#13;
            objectives with associated indicators to measure success. These indicators&#13;
            must extend beyond participants' reactions to track outcomes and impact.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Provide clear justification for the assignment of voting rights. The rationale&#13;
            for decisionmaking authority should link to concrete objectives for staff&#13;
            learning. Issues that need clarification include why Board members receive&#13;
            only one vote regardless of the number of staff they represent and why some&#13;
            VPUs have only observer status.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Honor members' areas of expertise. Divisive dynamics during Board&#13;
            meetings could be minimized by recognizing the value of different&#13;
            stakeholders. For example, experts or "champions" could be identified for&#13;
            learning specialization, operations experience, innovative regional initiatives,&#13;
            or other areas of expertise. Openly identifying the value or role of each&#13;
            member would have both cultural and practical importance. First, members&#13;
            would understand their purpose for serving on the Board and feel more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             56&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            empowered to contribute their expertise. Second, members would know&#13;
            whom to consult for specific matters or challenges, a valuable orientation&#13;
            given the Bank's decentralized structure.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Assign members more control of the Board's meeting agendas. Members&#13;
            expressed an interest in having more power to own meeting topics, including&#13;
            presenting a promising initiative of their VPU; joining with colleagues on the&#13;
            Board to report on a collaborative effort; bringing in an outside speaker to&#13;
            address a relevant topic; or using the time to solicit ideas for addressing a&#13;
            current area of concern. Since the transition of the Learning Board to the&#13;
            KLB, opportunities have increased for members to propose items for the&#13;
            agenda.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Use subcommittees to address corporate challenges or to launch Bankwide&#13;
            staff learning initiatives. The role of subcommittees should be formally&#13;
            defined in the policies and procedures of the new Knowledge and Learning&#13;
            Board. The strategic use of subcommittees would allow for effective&#13;
            discussion and efficiency given the large size and diverse composition of the&#13;
            Board.&#13;
&#13;
                                 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
5.6     The SLF was designed to support demand driven learning aligned with business&#13;
results. Major organizational and procedural changes were designed to promote the&#13;
effective and efficient use of resources. Key changes include establishing an&#13;
accountability framework managed through the CLO's office, in consultation with the&#13;
Knowledge and Learning Board, consolidating learning funds under the Learning Board,&#13;
establishing a learning plan process for VPUs, and eliminating internal course fees (the&#13;
"chargeback" system). However, this review did not identify clear evidence that learning&#13;
resources are now used more effectively or efficiently than they were under previous&#13;
arrangements for staff learning. Issues related to resource management are linked to two&#13;
general assumptions:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Assumption 1. A formula has been established for allocating learning&#13;
            resources to VPUs. Many Board members expressed confusion about how&#13;
            resources for staff learning are distributed among VPUs. The description of&#13;
            the allocation process in Board meeting minutes does not convey a clear&#13;
            formula or provide justification for funding decisions.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Assumption 2. The allocation of learning resources is aligned with the&#13;
            Bank's business objectives. A formal process has been established for VPUs&#13;
            to develop learning plans linked to their work plans, and VPUs submit&#13;
            quarterly progress reports to ensure that funds are used as planned. However,&#13;
            VPUs use a range of methods to assess staff learning needs and some base&#13;
            their plans on anecdotal information or simply repeat learning offerings from&#13;
            the previous year. In addition, some VPUs have not had any of their&#13;
            programs evaluated except at level 1 (participant reaction), and information&#13;
            on outcomes and impact is critical for assessing whether learning contributes&#13;
            to business results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             57&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.7     Procedural changes instituted under the SLF provide clear opportunities to direct&#13;
learning resources toward corporate priorities. The issues noted above support the&#13;
following recommendations to strengthen resource management:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Establish a transparent process for allocating resources for staff learning.&#13;
            Board members, the CLO, and the governing council should work together to&#13;
            develop and institute this process. Board members need to understand how&#13;
            funding decisions are made and be able to communicate these decisions&#13;
            accurately to their VPUs.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Identify standard methods and tools for assessing staff learning needs.&#13;
            Needs assessments should remain decentralized to identify local demands&#13;
            accurately. However, the Learning Board or CLO's office (through LSG)&#13;
            could establish a repository of tools and methods to improve this process.&#13;
            Examples include how to gain information on staff needs from sector boards,&#13;
            how to conduct staff surveys, and how to conduct focus groups with&#13;
            managers.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Use evaluation results to inform learning plans. Plans for future learning&#13;
            activities should incorporate lessons learned from similar activities or content&#13;
            areas. VPUs should refer to relevant evaluation results in their learning plans&#13;
            where possible to justify initiating new programs or changing the design or&#13;
            delivery of previous ones. This recommendation is linked to the need for&#13;
            more evaluations (see below).&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Establish a working committee to examine whether the SLF has had an effect&#13;
            on business results. A study of this issue should include an analysis of VPU&#13;
            learning plans, learning actually delivered, work plans, and evaluation results&#13;
            on operational impact.&#13;
&#13;
                             LEARNING DESIGN AND DELIVERY&#13;
&#13;
5.8     Unlike the previous arrangements for staff learning, the SLF's emphasis is on&#13;
quality and results rather than on inputs and outputs. Overall, the quality of learning&#13;
activities improved from FY03 to FY04 and has been maintained through FY05. More&#13;
important, the development of a standard level 1 evaluation process has resulted in&#13;
accurate baseline measurement starting in FY04. This permits assessment of changes in&#13;
quality over time. Due to the ongoing improvements to administrative data systems,&#13;
limited information was available for this review regarding changes in the types of&#13;
learning activities delivered under the SLF, and this raised questions about a key&#13;
assumption:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Assumption. The SLF has promoted the design and delivery of learning&#13;
            activities most appropriate for working adults, which has led to a change in&#13;
            the types of learning events offered (i.e., more e-learning, peer learning,&#13;
            team-based learning, mentoring, etc.) Administrative data do not provide&#13;
            evidence of significant changes since FY03 in the proportion of activities&#13;
            delivered through new forms of pedagogy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.9     It may well be that not enough time has elapsed under the SLF to expect&#13;
Bankwide changes in staff learning. Promising developments related to learning design&#13;
and delivery so far have included a broad range of new initiatives targeting priority&#13;
content areas and innovative programs designed to address persistent needs. Several of&#13;
these programs to date have enhanced staff capacity, and according to WBIEG studies,&#13;
three have resulted in operational impact (e.g., MTL Program, TLAP, and the EAP-SAR&#13;
Learning Program).&#13;
&#13;
5.10    Improvements in learning design and delivery will require that SLCs and regions&#13;
initiate change, supporting new approaches to staff learning. Suggestions to promote&#13;
such changes include:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Establish a subcommittee to continue monitoring and improving the LMS.&#13;
            Reliable administrative data are critical both for guiding staff participation&#13;
            and for tracking results. The Knowledge and Learning Board should define&#13;
            roles and procedures for monitoring progress and ensuring that the LMS&#13;
            leads to improved data quality.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Establish a clearinghouse of best practices. As the SLF matures, an&#13;
            increasing number of initiatives are launched or attempted, and systematic&#13;
            evaluation is yielding more information on results. Several stakeholders&#13;
            reported being overwhelmed with information and lacking constructive&#13;
            guidance when they needed it. Establishing a clearinghouse could offer&#13;
            useful direction to learning providers and other stakeholders as needed. LSG&#13;
            and WBIEG could collaborate to develop this clearinghouse, so that lessons&#13;
            gained from evaluation can be applied by learning providers.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Clarify the role and availability of the Learning Support Group. Stakeholders&#13;
            identified LSG as a useful resource for information on learning tools and&#13;
            technologies and hands-on support for designing curricula. Nonetheless,&#13;
            some Board members noted that LSG has limited staff and cannot respond to&#13;
            all requests for help. These members observed that the Board needs to clarify&#13;
            the process for enlisting assistance from LSG, so learning providers&#13;
            understand when to draw on this resource.&#13;
&#13;
                                       EVALUATION&#13;
&#13;
5.11    A major accomplishment of the new framework has been to institute systematic&#13;
evaluation to monitor quality, provide formative feedback, and identify outcomes. The&#13;
methodologies used by WBIEG for program evaluation have evolved substantially since&#13;
the SLF was established and a growing body of evidence on results is now available to&#13;
gauge progress.&#13;
&#13;
5.12    Monitoring quality and tracking the results of decentralized learning are important&#13;
centralized functions of the new framework. This review has outlined the clear evolution&#13;
of evaluation practices under the SLF, but it has also highlighted issues related to two&#13;
assumptions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Â· Assumption 1. Evidence-based conclusions are used to inform staff learning&#13;
            design and delivery. More program evaluations are needed to provide&#13;
            evidence of what features contribute to impact for which learning objectives.&#13;
            Some VPUs have not had any of their programs evaluated beyond&#13;
            participants' reaction.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Assumption 2. Formal procedures exist for selecting the programs to be&#13;
            evaluated by WBIEG. Programs designated for evaluation by WBIEG are&#13;
            typically high priority initiatives that reflect a substantial investment in terms&#13;
            of the staff learning budget. However, stakeholders expressed some concern&#13;
            that there was no clear policy for which programs would be selected in any&#13;
            given year.&#13;
&#13;
5.13    The role of evaluation for the SLF has been a major focus of this review because a&#13;
results-based model for staff learning requires evidence from evaluations to drive&#13;
continuous improvement. To date, few studies exist that actually report on results linked&#13;
to the Bank's business objectives. Recommendations to strengthen the evaluation of staff&#13;
learning include the following:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Dedicate a larger share of the learning budget to evaluation activities. In&#13;
            FY05 WBIEG spent $972,000 of Learning Board resources for evaluation,&#13;
            representing 1.4 percent of the learning budget of $69.5 million. Because the&#13;
            use of evaluation results is likely to increase the effectiveness and efficiency&#13;
            of staff learning over time, more funds should be directed to WBIEG or&#13;
            others to assess outcomes and impact.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Evaluate programs across all types of activities and learning providers. A&#13;
            major design feature of the SLF is the feedback loop to ground learning in&#13;
            results. The Knowledge and Learning Board and WBIEG should be strategic&#13;
            in selecting programs for evaluation, ensuring that all types of activities in&#13;
            use for staff learning are evaluated and that all VPUs that are learning&#13;
            providers receive information on results for at least one initiative.&#13;
&#13;
        Â· Create a formal process for requesting assistance with administrative data&#13;
            extraction. Several VPUs expressed interesting in analyzing extant data as&#13;
            part of their own efforts to monitor trends and evaluate program results.&#13;
            They noted that the CLO's office handles requests for assistance with data&#13;
            issues on an ad hoc basis, but not all requests are met due to staffing&#13;
            limitations. The process of this review highlighted many difficulties with&#13;
            extracting BW data and a current need for informed staff to monitor the&#13;
            accuracy of the resulting data files. The Knowledge and Learning Board&#13;
            should therefore establish a procedure for requesting data assistance on a trial&#13;
            basis. This process could provide useful information about how much&#13;
            technical assistance is needed to conduct accurate analyses related to staff&#13;
            learning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              60&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                      STATUS OF THE SLF&#13;
&#13;
5.14    The SLF appears to be an optimal structure for staff learning at the Bank in that it&#13;
provides for central decisionmaking and monitoring while being responsive to the&#13;
decentralized nature of the Bank's business. Centralized functions such as administrative&#13;
data systems and evaluation services support a cycle of improvement where results can&#13;
be used to inform learning design and delivery. This results-based framework is likely to&#13;
optimize the learning available for Bank staff over time. The recommendations presented&#13;
in this chapter therefore suggest incremental improvements to the current system rather&#13;
than major structural changes.&#13;
&#13;
5.15    After its first four years, the SLF has provided important groundwork for&#13;
addressing the pressing business issues identified in the 2001 ART. The findings of this&#13;
review confirm that this new governance and organizational framework has started to&#13;
clarify responsibilities for staff learning and increased accountability--particularly&#13;
through monitoring quality and, in some cases, evaluating program impact. Initiatives&#13;
launched under the SLF have modeled the effective use of e-learning (e.g., TLAP) and&#13;
shifted the emphasis beyond a narrow focus on individual technical expertise (e.g.,&#13;
MTL). Interviews with selected staff and results from the staff survey provide some&#13;
evidence that the Bank's culture is transforming to support staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
5.16    This review also highlights important work yet to be accomplished. The&#13;
challenges put forth by the 2001 ART have not yet been successfully met. The Learning&#13;
Board must still prioritize the strengthening of operational training and the development&#13;
of a cohesive management curriculum to support managerial excellence. Learning&#13;
activities often still rely on tools and methods that are not aligned with adult learning&#13;
needs. Incremental changes are needed to strengthen the learning infrastructure,&#13;
including further clarification on the appropriate roles for regions and networks and a&#13;
more systematic approach to identifying opportunities for collaboration among VPUs.&#13;
Most important, the Knowledge and Learning Board must still define the indicators of&#13;
success, through which to set priorities and gauge progress towards the SLF objectives in&#13;
the future.&#13;
&#13;

                                  METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
        This independent review of the Bank's Staff Learning Framework was conducted&#13;
by Dawn Roberts, Lead Review Consultant, and Toni Hodges, Benchmarking Consultant.&#13;
The study relied on existing documents and archival data within the World Bank related&#13;
to staff learning and interviews with 74 Bank managers and staff. In addition, the&#13;
benchmarking component of this study included a review of ASTD data and interviews&#13;
with staff learning representatives of six large and decentralized organizations.&#13;
&#13;
                                 EVALUATION QUESTIONS&#13;
&#13;
        The CLO and the KLB have responsibilities in four areas: Overall strategy and&#13;
policy, resource allocation, communication, and monitoring and evaluation. The terms of&#13;
reference (TOR) tasked this review with assessing the organizational structure and&#13;
implementation of the SLF with respect to these four areas. The review compared the&#13;
SLF with previous arrangements for staff learning and identified recommendations for&#13;
improvements according to the following evaluation questions in the TOR:&#13;
&#13;
Summary assessment - Objectives and organizational structure of the SLF&#13;
&#13;
Objectives of the SLF&#13;
&#13;
    (a)     What were the SLF's documented objectives at the time establishment? How,&#13;
        when and why have objectives evolved since the establishment of the SLF? Are&#13;
        the current objectives appropriate for the institution? How clearly are the&#13;
        objectives defined?&#13;
&#13;
    (b)     Are the current objectives appropriate for the institution? How clearly are the&#13;
        objectives defined?&#13;
&#13;
             Â· How do the Bank's SLF and Business Plan align? Do key stakeholders&#13;
                 know about and/or share ownership in that alignment?&#13;
&#13;
             Â· If the SLF is the Bank's "learning and knowledge management plan" and&#13;
                 the Business Plan is its "doing plan," what opportunities are created to&#13;
                 integrate these SLF and Business plan so that the Bank can better learn&#13;
                 from doing?&#13;
&#13;
    (c)     How do original and current SLF objectives differ from those under the pre-&#13;
        SLF learning structure?&#13;
&#13;
    (d)     How should the SLF objectives be modified to better support staff learning?&#13;

      SLF?&#13;
&#13;
   (c)     What criteria were used in establishing/refiguring the LB and determining its&#13;
      membership? What are the operating, reporting, and monitoring arrangements?&#13;
      What mechanisms are in place to resolve differences among members and&#13;
      competing interests? Is the current LB structure an optimum one as a&#13;
      decisionmaking body?&#13;
&#13;
   (d)     How have SLF structures and processes helped the Bank meet key desired&#13;
      objectives of the FY01 reorganization and strengthened the Bank as a learning&#13;
      organization?&#13;
&#13;
            Â· Does the SLF structure/process create integrative learning strategies in&#13;
               support of the Bank's goals?&#13;
&#13;
            Â· Does the structure ensure that its trainers, consultants, and learning&#13;
               providers are grounded in the real world challenges and needs of the&#13;
               field?&#13;
&#13;
   (e)     How does the organizational structure and processes compare with other large&#13;
      organizations - especially those with diverse staff members who operate globally -&#13;
      in implementing broad-based learning for their staff? What are some best&#13;
      practices in staff learning at these organizations that the SLF might consider&#13;
      adopting?&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
    (d)    How should the SLF overall strategy, policies, and priorities be modified to&#13;
       achieve greater effectiveness?&#13;
&#13;
  Providing guidance to Bank units on corporate learning strategies and priorities&#13;
    (a)    What guidance (formal and informal) does the SLF provide to Bank units on&#13;
       corporate learning strategies and priorities? Is the received guidance sufficient&#13;
       and effective for Bank units?&#13;

&#13;
  (h)     How should the SLF adjust its existing review mechanisms?&#13;
&#13;
Resource Allocation&#13;
&#13;
  (a)     Is there a mechanism to ensure that the resources allocated are utilized&#13;
      effectively and efficiently?&#13;
&#13;
  (b)     What are the differences in terms of how resources are allocated and amount&#13;
      of resources allocated under the SLF compared to the previous staff learning&#13;

         and better used?&#13;
&#13;
     (f)      What steps has the Bank taken to ground learning in results?&#13;
&#13;
DATA COLLECTION&#13;
&#13;
         Qualitative interviews served two major functions in this review. First, they&#13;
oriented the lead consultant to available data sources. Second, they provided the&#13;
opportunity to explore the insights and experiences of a range of staff learning&#13;
stakeholders. The purposeful sample of individuals selected for interviews were those&#13;
most likely to have extensive knowledge about the Bank as a learning organization.&#13;
Within the World Bank, these key informants included 43 current or former Learning&#13;
Board members, observers, or direct support;34 and 8 individuals heavily involved in the&#13;
transition to the SLF.35 In addition, staff perspectives and experiences were explored by&#13;
first interviewing three sector managers and then interviewing 28 staff--9 of these at&#13;
headquarters and 19 in the field.36 Overall, a snowball sampling process was used, where&#13;
well-situated people (such as Learning Board members) identified others knowledgeable&#13;
about staff learning.&#13;
&#13;
         Interviews relied on an open-ended protocol but also allowed for stakeholders to&#13;
raise and explore issues they believed were critical. Most of the sessions with Learning&#13;
Board stakeholders lasted 45 minutes to an hour. In most cases, these interviews were in-&#13;
person, with the author meeting individually with the key informant. In four cases,&#13;
Learning Board stakeholders met with the author in pairs. The 28 interviews with staff&#13;
were conducted by telephone and lasted an average of 20 minutes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
34These include current and former members of WBIEG, HRSLB, and LSG.&#13;
35This list of Learning Board stakeholders is 46 since some current and former members were involved in&#13;
the transition and therefore appear in more than one category.&#13;
36Staff were at various levels: one individual interviewed in the field was also a sector manager.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      67&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        In addition to data from interviews, the authors reviewed and analyzed reports and&#13;
data related to learning activity design, delivery, participation, and costs. Reports from&#13;
the Learning Board and from WBIEG evaluations were also reviewed. Other documents&#13;
that provide information on previous arrangements for staff learning or specific staff&#13;
learning initiatives were identified and collected from individuals' archives during&#13;
interviews. In some cases, these documents contain important details (such as the topics&#13;
and teams of the 2001 staff learning ART) but lack authors and dates.&#13;
&#13;
        The author did not have direct access to Business Warehouse or PeopleSoft data&#13;
related to staff learning, but WBIEG facilitated requests for datasets to analyze trends in&#13;
staff learning activities and participation over time. WBIEG provided 12 files with BW&#13;
and/or PeopleSoft data during this review, but the analyses of these files revealed a high&#13;
number of unassigned or missing values (up to 40 percent of the fields) and a potential&#13;
problem with double-counting. Staff in the CLO's office provided clarification on data&#13;
issues. One set of findings in this review focuses on the improvement of data quality&#13;
over time (a major accomplishment of the SLF), and the data analysis contributed to the&#13;
understanding of data system issues rather than producing new information regarding the&#13;
type or quality of learning events delivered to World Bank staff.&#13;
&#13;
ANALYSIS AND REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
        Qualitative data from the document review and interviews were sorted and coded&#13;
according to major themes. As data gaps and discrepancies were identified, the lead&#13;
author drew on the assistance of the WBIEG TTL and staff learning key informants to&#13;
locate additional information. Recurring issues or themes that emerged from interviews&#13;
are included in this report if they are relevant to the evaluation questions and surfaced in&#13;
at least three interviews. In some cases, direct quotes convey the thoughts of Learning&#13;
Board stakeholders or staff, but these are presented only if they reflect a recurring theme&#13;
(among Learning Board stakeholders) or an interesting perspective on learning (among&#13;
staff) while preserving confidentiality.&#13;

                                      APPENDIX B:&#13;
    BEFORE THE NEW STAFF LEARNING FRAMEWORK: A BRIEF&#13;
                                         HISTORY&#13;
&#13;
        In FY96--the year of its commitment to become a "Knowledge Bank"--the&#13;
World Bank Group initiated a new education and training effort to raise the professional&#13;
standards and diversify the skills of its staff. The new programs were designed to "help&#13;
strengthen management capacity across the Bank, restore the Bank's skills base, and&#13;
ensure professional excellence at all levels, enhancing the Bank's awareness and&#13;
competitiveness" (World Bank 1996). The Strategic Compact (1997) then launched a&#13;
number of renewal initiatives, including a comprehensive reform of the Bank's human&#13;
resource policies.&#13;
&#13;
        As an expression of the Bank's business strategy, the Compact emphasized that&#13;
business needs should drive learning, that learning contributes to excellence, and that&#13;
learning alongside clients can enhance development effectiveness. A critical requirement&#13;
of the Bank's new vision was "to equip staff with the cutting-edge knowledge, skills, and&#13;
tools to fight poverty and build client capacity." As a result, the Bank Group formally&#13;
prioritized professional development and endorsed spending 5 percent of its net&#13;
administrative budget on staff learning, a benchmark based on comparable "knowledge"&#13;
firms (World Bank 1999a and World Bank 2000b). At this time, the major provider for&#13;
learning and training activities for staff was the Learning and Leadership Center (LLC)&#13;
while the one for clients was the Economic Development Institute (EDI). The Governing&#13;
Council for Learning and the Information and Knowledge Management Council shared&#13;
the governance of learning and knowledge management activities.&#13;
&#13;
        The learning agenda pursued by the LLC explicitly recognized the need to:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· "have users strongly influence learning services;&#13;
        Â· become a competency-based organization where learning is a business-driven&#13;
            responsibility of staff and managers;&#13;
&#13;
        Â· exploit the synergy between staff and client learning;&#13;
&#13;
        Â· support alternative modes of learning; and&#13;
        Â· monitor and evaluate learning activities for effective use of resources (World&#13;
            Bank 2000b)."&#13;
&#13;
        Despite these stated priorities, measures of success focused mainly on such&#13;
outputs as the numbers of learning events and staff training days. A snapshot of LLC&#13;
accomplishments for FY98 includes the following data on activities and participation:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· "Over 9,000 staff and managers attended more than 600 learning/training&#13;
            activities,&#13;
&#13;
        Â· 240 managers and potential managers attended the Executive Development&#13;
            Program (EDP),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               69&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         Â· 15 Sector Weeks, organized by the Bank's new professional networks&#13;
               brought together more than 3,300 staff and outside specialists,&#13;
&#13;
         Â· 39 staff undertook external development assignments, providing them with&#13;
               targeted learning opportunities,&#13;
&#13;
         Â· The Presidential Fellows Program brought 7 eminent specialists and scholars&#13;
               to the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
         Â· The LLC continued its partnership with the IMF Institute to offer courses for&#13;
               Bank and IMF staff; and&#13;
&#13;
         Â· The LLC offered 22 programs jointly with EDI where Bank staff and client&#13;
               country participants studied subjects such as managing capital flows, rural&#13;
               transport, and advance macroeconomic management (World Bank 1998a)."&#13;
&#13;
         The structure for learning and knowledge management was streamlined in FY99,&#13;
with the merger of EDI and the LLC into the new World Bank Institute (WBI), and the&#13;
merger of governance functions into the new Knowledge and Learning Council (KLC).37&#13;
&#13;
        THE KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING COUNCIL'S ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
&#13;
         The KLC was coordinated by a secretariat and consisted of a dozen Bank vice&#13;
presidents who met quarterly to promote coherence among the various learning programs&#13;
and to integrate them with the Bank's core work programs. The director of the newly&#13;
created WBI reported directly to the KLC, which--like a board of directors--oversaw&#13;
the implementation of the learning agenda.38 Key responsibilities for staff learning were&#13;
distributed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
         Â· The KLC was responsible for governance--including setting overall strategy,&#13;
               allocating resources for learning design and delivery, and monitoring&#13;
               performance and quality.&#13;
&#13;
         Â· WBI was accountable for the implementation of the learning agenda. WBI&#13;
               delivered client learning, staff training in functional skills, and general&#13;
               learning services.&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Networks provided professional and technical (P&amp;T) learning. WBI's&#13;
               director and the vice president of Operation Country Services (OCS) shared&#13;
               oversight for the P&amp;T program.39&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Human Resources (HR) was responsible for leadership development&#13;
               programs and behavioral learning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
37The KLC governed staff and client learning as well as knowledge sharing. The focus in this report is&#13;
limited to staff learning since that is the function analogous to the current Staff Learning Framework.&#13;
38WBI did not become a vice presidency until 2000.&#13;
39The World Bank Group pursues its work through vice presidential units (VPUs) that focus on a particular&#13;
region or sector to fight poverty and encourage economic development. Those VPUs focused on specific&#13;
sectors are known as "networks." The number and names of networks have evolved over time: Operation&#13;
Country Services (OCS) is now known as Operational Policy and Country Services (OPCS).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       70&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         Â· Regions and other vice presidential units (VPUs) funded staff time and travel&#13;
              for staff to attend learning activities and delivered their own events related to&#13;
              specific VPU priorities. The role of regions and other business units in the&#13;
              implementation of the learning agenda was not clearly defined, and regional&#13;
              programs tended to be small and informal.&#13;
&#13;
         Resource allocation under the KLC included a bureaucratic chargeback system&#13;
that would later be eliminated under the new SLF. Under that system, the KLC&#13;
embedded 80 percent of the funds allocated for learning in the individual budgets for the&#13;
networks, HR, and WBI. The remaining 20 percent was earned in the form of course fees&#13;
through an internal transfer from the budget of the trainee's unit to the supplier's. This&#13;
so-called "chargeback" was the mechanism by which a staff member's organizational&#13;
unit was charged for participation in a specific training event. All organizational units in&#13;
the Bank had a real or notional budget for staff training in their discretionary dollar&#13;
budgets that could be spent internally or externally on the direct costs of staff training,&#13;
including chargeback.&#13;
&#13;
                                    PRIORITIES OF THE KLC&#13;
&#13;
         In several ways, the KLC-administered system for staff learning served as a&#13;
stepping stone from previous professional development arrangements to the SLF now in&#13;
place. The Working Group on Learning under the KLC highlighted a series of priorities&#13;
in its first progress report (September 1998):&#13;
&#13;
         Â· "Focus should move from inputs to learning goals and results,&#13;
         Â· Users should have strong influence on learning services,&#13;
&#13;
         Â· There should be flexibility to support alternate modes of learning, and&#13;
         Â· Service providers must be responsive to users on quality, format, and cost&#13;
              effectiveness" (World Bank 1998b).&#13;
&#13;
During FY99 and FY00, the KLC and staff learning stakeholders took steps towards&#13;
system reform, linking learning activities to business objectives, developing new&#13;
monitoring and tracking processes, and beginning to evaluate results.&#13;
&#13;
Integrating learning and business planning&#13;
&#13;
         Among the governing principles for the learning agenda was the assertion that the&#13;
learning strategy had to be "business needs driven." As shown in figure 9, the KLC&#13;
worked to clarify how learning activities could be aligned systematically with business&#13;
objectives. The KLC was designed to be a "visible governance structure that signals an&#13;
acknowledgment that senior management is fully committed to staff learning," so that&#13;
units would work intentionally to ensure that staff have the skills and competencies&#13;
needed to achieve the Bank Group's business goals (World Bank 1999b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                71&#13;

    Note: This figure is provided to illustrate efforts under the KLC to align learning with business&#13;
    planning. PBD refers to the Programming and Budgeting Department and NW refers to Networks.&#13;
&#13;
        Despite increased emphasis on linking learning to business results, little evidence&#13;
was available for this review of which learning activities were being designed specifically&#13;
in response to staff needs to perform their work plans better. At the end of FY98, a task&#13;
force appointed by the KLC recommended establishing a three-year agenda to ensure that&#13;
business needs drive learning decisions and, in particular, to create greater transparency&#13;
in the deployment of regional learning resources to fill strategic gaps (World Bank&#13;
1999b).&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
        The KLC recognized the need for a comprehensive system to track learning. A&#13;
KLC working group developed the concept for this system to record all learning&#13;
activities, both formal and nonformal, that WBI, the networks, or external vendors&#13;
provided. A key part of this vision involved moving away from simply tracking staff&#13;
training days and the number of activities and instead using a learning scorecard focused&#13;
on five indicators:&#13;
&#13;
        a. Total learning investment as a percent of total budget: Training delivered&#13;
             and received would be captured separately. The cost of staff time would be&#13;
             included only for training received. The total learning investment would&#13;
             represent the sum of both training delivered and received.&#13;
&#13;
        b. Volume of training, formal and nonformal: The total number of training&#13;
             days by provider would be captured.40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40Formal learning activities include structured classroom training organized for the acquisition of new and&#13;
well-defined knowledge and skills. Nonformal learning activities are for continuous learning and cover a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      72&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         c. Cost per training day by program: Programs were defined within the broad&#13;
             categories of leadership, professional and technical, Bank skills, and external.&#13;
&#13;
         d. Who is being reached: The profile of participants (headquarters staff, field&#13;
             staff, external participants, salary grades 11-17, 18+, 25+, etc.) would be&#13;
             tracked by share of program costs.&#13;
&#13;
         e. Source of funding, including the Central Learning Budget (held by HR, WBI,&#13;
             networks), VPU discretionary budget, and the corresponding portion subject&#13;
             to chargeback, or external funding such as trust funds (World Bank 1998b).&#13;
&#13;
Limited documentation from the KLC period was available for this review, but the&#13;
evidence suggests that development of this monitoring system was deferred until plans&#13;
for new time recording and cost accounting systems could be implemented.&#13;
&#13;
         The new emphasis on monitoring quality rather than quantity was a major&#13;
component of efforts to improve staff learning under the KLC. In FY99, the KLC&#13;
requested the WBI evaluation unit to establish a method for monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Attention first focused on the quality of the design, content, and learning outcomes of&#13;
formal classroom training courses of the networks and nonnetworks through participant&#13;
ratings and comments (level 1) (Rist 1999; World Bank 2001a). A new standard&#13;
questionnaire was developed for evaluating participants' reactions with questions&#13;
focusing on relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, potential impact, and the quality of&#13;
training design and delivery. WBI established a benchmark for quality--consistent with&#13;
its system for client training--at 85 percent favorable ratings.41 Quality ratings from a&#13;
nonrandom sample of participants improved from FY99 to FY00, as shown in Table 22.42&#13;
In FY00, 83 percent of 5,473 participants provided a favorable rating for overall training&#13;
quality, slightly below the quality benchmark of 85 percent. There was a notable&#13;
difference between the ratings for network events (77 percent favorable) and those for&#13;
Bank skills training (e.g., IT ACS, and crossnetwork activities) provided by WBI Skills&#13;
Development (WBISD, 90 percent favorable).43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
wide range of events--including clinics, action-learning workshops, intact team work sessions, brown bag&#13;
seminars, and discussion group sessions. For a description of these activities, see Prom-Jackson et. al.&#13;
(2002).&#13;
41A favorable rating is a 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale. This benchmark was comparable to those set by well-&#13;
known education and training institutions such as Motorola University and Linkage Incorporated. See&#13;
Prom-Jackson et al. (1999).&#13;
42Because a level 1 questionnaire was launched in April 1999, this study is based on the responses of 60&#13;
percent of the participants who completed formal classroom training in the fourth quarter of FY99. Results&#13;
from the former LLC questionnaire were not available for this review. This explains the marked difference&#13;
in the number of participants between FY99 and FY00.&#13;
43The methodology for level 1 monitoring has evolved under the new Staff Learning Framework. Changes&#13;
to this system are discussed in chapter 2.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
        The KLC recognized the importance of evaluating the outcomes of learning&#13;
programs from the outset. In FY99, the Working Group on Learning noted that "serious&#13;
evaluation of learning programs beyond self-assessments at the end of a training course&#13;
has not been done in the Bank." The first formal efforts of the WBI evaluation group in&#13;
FY99 focused on quality (level 1), and in FY00, the KLC expanded the request to include&#13;
impact evaluations for formal trainings and the evaluation of sector weeks, conferences&#13;
designed to provide cutting-edge knowledge on critical issues and to create opportunities&#13;
for network staff to meet others facing similar challenges. Plans for these studies are&#13;
noted in KLC documents, but systematic evaluation beyond participant reaction was not&#13;
implemented for staff learning until after the new SLF was established.44&#13;
&#13;
                   THE KLC'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CHALLENGES&#13;
&#13;
        The KLC achieved much, but many challenges remained. A review of documents&#13;
and interviews with stakeholders indicated that several enhancements for professional&#13;
development were explored under the KLC. Interest was especially notable on rethinking&#13;
the appropriate measures of success. Despite the new evaluation framework and plans&#13;
for a comprehensive tracking system, the indicators reported by the KLC still emphasized&#13;
the number of training days (table 23).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
         The numbers in table 24 indicate the general distribution of training activities&#13;
across units and content areas, but it is important to note that these numbers cannot be&#13;
meaningfully compared to learning activities supported by the current system. The SLF's&#13;
objectives promote new forms of pedagogy, offer fewer formal training activities, and&#13;
apply performance criteria rather than just counting training days.&#13;
&#13;
         Little information on the results of training activities during this period was&#13;
available for this study, but the survey of all Bank staff periodically administered by HR&#13;
did reflect incremental improvement in staff perspectives on training between 1997 and&#13;
1999. Sixty percent of staff in 1999 responded favorably to "My manager has given me&#13;
the time to take advantage of training opportunities" compared to 46 percent in 1997. For&#13;
"My opportunities for training have increased," 49 percent responded favorably&#13;
compared to 41 percent in 1997.45 While these results represented positive changes, the&#13;
KLC recognized that the ratings remained low, one of many factors signaling the need for&#13;
improvements in the Bank's learning organization.&#13;
&#13;
         In FY01, the Bank launched a comprehensive review of staff learning designed to&#13;
evaluate the strategic direction of learning in the Bank and to identify high priority action&#13;
recommendations to strengthen the impact and effectiveness of the staff learning program&#13;
(World Bank 2001b). This exercise confirmed that progress had been achieved in&#13;
retooling the technical skills of staff since the Strategic Compact, but it also highlighted&#13;
some serious shortcomings of staff learning under the KLC:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
45These results cannot be directly compared to those under the SLF because the survey questions have&#13;
changed. Also, response rates on the staff survey were notably lower in 1997 (50 percent) and 1999 (55&#13;
percent) then in 2003 (83 percent). A discussion of later survey results and their relationship to these under&#13;
the KLC is provided in chapter 3.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
         Â· The emphasis on individual technical expertise was out of step with the&#13;
             Bank's strategy and business needs.&#13;
&#13;
         Â· The learning tools and methods in use were not aligned with adult learning&#13;
             needs.&#13;
&#13;
         Â· There was insufficient ownership and accountability for learning in the&#13;
             governance and organizational framework.&#13;
&#13;
         Â· Transformation of the learning program would require significant changes in&#13;
             the Bank's culture--particularly with regard to trust, accountability, and&#13;
             selectivity.&#13;
&#13;
         In response to these challenges, 60 staff representing all key stakeholders&#13;
(including country and sector directors, field and headquarters staff, ACS staff, internal&#13;
and external learning experts, and personnel from the International Finance Corporation)&#13;
met in March 2001 to identify key measures for strengthening the impact and&#13;
effectiveness of staff learning. The team used the participatory "Accelerating Results&#13;

&#13;
        In all of its endeavors the Learning Board seeks to provide an enabling&#13;
environment for effective staff learning. Based on changing business needs and the focus&#13;
on CDFs and PRSPs, a new staff learning framework has been developed. The Learning&#13;
Board is the driving force for its implementation, including the following key aspects:&#13;

                       OPERATING AGREEMENTS AND PROCEDURES&#13;
&#13;
Membership&#13;
&#13;
        The designated member needs to have sufficient seniority to decide things on&#13;
behalf of the VPU and communicate on learning matters throughout the VPU. The LB&#13;
representative should be the substantive focal point for learning in the VPU.&#13;
&#13;
        For each principal member, there should be a designated alternate. The policy will&#13;
be that the principal member should normally attend LB meetings.&#13;
&#13;
Composition&#13;
&#13;
        In addition to the CLO, there will be 18 voting members of the LB, one each&#13;
from:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· SLCs (11 total)&#13;
        Â· Regions (6)&#13;
        Â· WBI&#13;
&#13;
        Â· IFC&#13;
        Â· MIGA&#13;
&#13;
The following entities will be allowed one member with observer status:&#13;
&#13;
        Â· DEC&#13;
&#13;
        Â· LEG&#13;
        Â· RM (Resource Management)&#13;
        Â· EXT&#13;
&#13;
        Â· LSG, WBIEG, and KLE Program will be invited to attend each Board&#13;
             meeting (with observer status).&#13;
&#13;
Meetings&#13;
&#13;
        Meetings will normally be held once every other week, with longer intervals&#13;
between meetings during the summer and year-end holiday seasons. When needed, the&#13;
Learning Board will convene weekly.&#13;
&#13;
        Each meeting will be clearly designated as informational, decisionmaking, or in&#13;
limited cases, both.&#13;
&#13;
        If a powerpoint presentation will be discussed at a meeting, the powerpoint&#13;
presentation should be circulated via email to members no later than the evening&#13;
preceding the meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            79&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Decision making&#13;
&#13;
        Both voting and observer Board members will normally be invited to all&#13;
meetings. The usual mode of decision making will be by consensus or majority&#13;
agreement, preceded by discussion among all members present.&#13;
&#13;
        Occasionally, when required, there will be a more formal voting process with&#13;
voting limited to the 18 voting members (or designated alternates) of the Board. The&#13;
CLO, if needed, would cast the 19th (and deciding) vote.&#13;
&#13;
        In any meeting where decisions are required, at least 3 Regions and 5 SLCs must&#13;
be present.&#13;
&#13;
        If such a quorum is not present at a meeting where a decision is required, limited&#13;
discussion of the topic will take place at the meeting. After the meeting, the CLO will&#13;
contact via email those members who were not in attendance. Based on the discussion at&#13;
the meeting and the subsequent views via email, the CLO would then make the relevant&#13;
decision(s) and communicate this decision to the membership.&#13;
&#13;
Other&#13;
&#13;
        The Learning Board will create its own team learning plan.&#13;
&#13;
        On occasion, Board members will be asked to lead and/or participate in task&#13;
forces, and they agree to commit the time necessary to make such task forces successful,&#13;
with their time compensated for by the CLO's office, if necessary.&#13;

            Review of the World Bank Group's staff
            learning framework
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The World Bank Group adopted a new Staff
            Learning Framework (SLF) in late FY01 to align learning with
            core business needs. At the request of the Bank's Chief
            Learning Officer (CLO), the World Bank Institute Evaluation
            Group (WBIEG) managed this independent review of the SLF to
            assess whether the new system has led to improvements in the
            relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of staff learning
            in the Bank. The study addresses two objectives: to inform
            on the progress in implementing the SLF's mandate
            (relevance and efficiency) and the outcomes/impact
            (effectiveness) of the SLF's overall strategy in
            advancing staff learning, as compared to the previous
            arrangements for staff learning; and to provide
            recommendations on what the Bank and the SLF leaders must do
            to ensure that staff learning results in effective and
            efficient use of resources. Data sources in this report
            include documents and archival data related to staff
            learning and interviews with 74 Bank staff. In addition, a
            benchmarking consultant compared the Bank's
            professional development systems and practices with those of
            six other large organizations and reviewed data from
            industry standards. A description of the study methodology
            with the evaluation questions is also available in appendix A.
