Solutions for Reducing&#13;
Borehole Costs in Rural Africa&#13;
Approximately 256 million people in rural Africa live without access to safe water supplies, in areas that&#13;
could be appropriately supplied with water from hand-pumped boreholes. This field note contends that&#13;
the current cost of drilled boreholes in Africa can be halved by relaxing borehole specifications in favor of&#13;
smaller diameter bores drilled by more maneuverable, lower cost equipment.&#13;

Groundwater is generally a readily available source&#13;
of water throughout Africa. However, high borehole&#13;
construction costs are slowing progress on increased&#13;
access. Higher costs are largely a result of using&#13;
drilling equipment with specifications that are greater&#13;
than those required for the vast majority of boreholes&#13;
needed in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Using high cost machinery and support equipment&#13;
leads to high borehole costs, which in turn results in&#13;
fewer boreholes being drilled. The smaller volume of       Water supply&#13;

work per drilling rig creates inefficiencies in equipment&#13;
usage, and results in increased overheads, driving up                 0%­25%&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
This analysis of borehole drilling&#13;
techniques suggests that the following&#13;
measures could make possible a huge&#13;
increase in borehole construction, and&#13;
rural water supply coverage throughout&#13;
Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Relax the outdated national&#13;
standards that favor&#13;
conservative borehole designs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Smaller diameters holes should&#13;
be drilled to reduce the cost of the&#13;
construction equipment and the&#13;
infrastructure needed to support them.&#13;
Borehole designs need to embrace&#13;
variations in geology, the occurrence of&#13;
groundwater, and innovations in drilling&#13;
technology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Develop an effective small&#13;
business sector made up of&#13;
African drilling contractors,&#13;
based in rural areas, and spread&#13;
                                           A portable drilling rig with DTH capacity.&#13;
between the communities they&#13;
are required to serve                      However, lack of specialized technical       thresholds for all new or modified&#13;
                                           and business skills hinders the ability      borehole designs need to be developed.&#13;
&#13;
The alternative technology choice opens    of local enterprise to undertake such&#13;
&#13;
the door to huge cost reductions in        activities. Seed schemes that could          Provide continuity of work for&#13;
borehole drilling for water supplies, but  provide technical and business training      local business&#13;
this technology needs skilful operation    to entrepreneurs, linked with credit for&#13;
&#13;
based on both knowledge and                capital equipment purchase, would            Contractual frameworks that allow small&#13;
experience.                                improve the success rate of such firms.      practicing businesses some continuity&#13;
                                                                                        of work should be created. Advantages&#13;
An ideal world would see rurally based     Promote new, appropriate                     would include maximizing machine&#13;
small businesses operating drilling        drilling technologies                        usage and availability within a fixed&#13;
machines for local community water                                                      set of overheads, and increasing the&#13;
supplies. Such businesses would drill      Acceptable borehole constructions            confidence levels of commercial lending&#13;
new schemes, as well as have the           need to be established and then              institutions in the local drilling industry.&#13;
capacity to undertake well rehabilitation, broadened to the application of simple       Such confidence would be increased by&#13;
pump improvements, and maintenance         machines capable of achieving these          training and other methods designed to&#13;
duties.                                    standards. Minimum quality control           control quality of drilling construction.&#13;

            Solutions for reducing borehole costs in

        <abstracts>
            This field note contends that the
            current cost of drilled boreholes in Africa can be halved by
            relaxing borehole specifications in favor of smaller
            diameter bores drilled by more maneuverable, lower cost
            equipment. The average cost of drilling a borehole can be
            reduced from USD$6,000 to USD$3,000, and some technological
            applications could bring down the cost to less than
            USD$1,000. These sizable cost reductions have the potential
            to contribute to Africa's attainment of the Millennium
            Development Goals (MDGs) for water supply and sanitatio
