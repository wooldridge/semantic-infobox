regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a&#13;
Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1.   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and&#13;
shall be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust&#13;
Fund may be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its&#13;
capacity as trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2.   The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is the United States&#13;
Dollars (the "Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution&#13;
Currency other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the&#13;
accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding&#13;
Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where&#13;
deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations,&#13;
neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional&#13;
financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the&#13;
date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment&#13;
of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment&#13;
to the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to two:percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2.   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program&#13;
management and Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction&#13;
specified above as an administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the&#13;
Administration Agreements in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures&#13;
shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a maximum of two point seventy six&#13;
percent (2.76%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of&#13;
the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs&#13;
change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and&#13;
Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration&#13;
Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that&#13;
are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from&#13;
new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1.   The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
4.2.   The Bank shall furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all&#13;
commitments and liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been&#13;
closed, the final financial information relating to receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the&#13;
Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions shall be made available to the Donors via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
4.3.   The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center&#13;
secure website, within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single&#13;
audit report, comprising (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's&#13;
external auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting&#13;
for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the&#13;
single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4.   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to&#13;
whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the&#13;
appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and&#13;
terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit,&#13;
including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the&#13;
requesting Donor.&#13;
4.5.   The Bank shall make available to the Donors copies of all financial statements and&#13;
auditors' reports received by the Bank from Recipients pursuant to any Grant Agreements (as&#13;
defined below) in accordance with the Bank's Access to Information Policy.&#13;
5.     Progress Reporting&#13;
5.1    The Bank shall provide the Donors with semi-annual reports on the progress of activities&#13;
financed by the Contributions. Within six (6) months of the End Disbursement Date (as defined&#13;
below), the Bank shall furnish to the Donors a final report on the activities financed by the Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
5.2    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up&#13;
to six (6) months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank shall agree on&#13;
the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant&#13;
information within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated&#13;
costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that&#13;
any such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement: Cancellation: Refund&#13;
6.1.  It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the&#13;
Bank by June 30, 2016 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns&#13;
to Donors) after such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments&#13;
made to the Administration Agreements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement&#13;
Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding&#13;
Currency in the manner specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis&#13;
with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
6.2.   Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel&#13;
all or any Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions&#13;
(paid and not yet paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the&#13;
Bank and any consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration&#13;
Agreement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a&#13;
cancellation, the Bank shall return to the relevant Donor or Donors in the Holding Currency in the&#13;
manner specified by each such Donor in its respective Administration Agreement the pro rata&#13;
share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the Trust Fund, in accordance with any additional&#13;
terms that may be agreed between the Bank and each such Donor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿7.     Disclosure: Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1.   The Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this&#13;

Administration Agreements and such related information.&#13;
