            Management contracts and water utilities :
            the case of Monagas State in Venezuela
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The management contract for water and
            sanitation services in the Venezuelan state of Monagas,
            awarded in early 1997 to a Spanish firm, is one of very few
            signed and active management contracts in the water sector.
            Management contracts pose design challenges. Their built-in
            incentives do not include equity at risk, so surrogate
            incentives must be designed, such as a performance bonus.
            Deciding how to award these contracts is also a challenge,
            because they lie somewhere between technical assistance
            (which should be awarded on the basis of skill and
            experience) and a lease (which should be awarded on the
            basis of price). It is too early to say whether management
            contracts can evolve into a more high-powered form of
            private participation like a concession. But the early
            operational results are very positive, and the experience
            sheds light on when a management contract is the right
            choice, how it should be designed to introduce the right
            incentives for the contractor and the public
            representatives, and what steps to take in awarding it.
