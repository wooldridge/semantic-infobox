        <abstracts>
            In the past few years, state power
            companies in many countries have offered independent power
            producers (IPPs) the opportunity to tender for new or
            existing generation. Often unrecognized is what may be an
            unintended consequence of introducing IPPs: they plant the
            seeds for a top-to-bottom change in the structure and
            operation of government-owned utilities. The authors review
            the forces at work.
