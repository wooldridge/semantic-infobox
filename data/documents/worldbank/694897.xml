BANKING, ENTERPRISE AND LEGAL TECHNICAL&#13;
ASSISTANCE CREDIT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Over the past six years, Mongolia has made considerable progress in transforming&#13;
its economy into a market system. The country was plunged into economic turmoil in&#13;
1990 when the collapsing Soviet Union withdrew its subsidies, and the CMEA trading&#13;
system disintegrated. Within months, Mongolia lost 35 percent of its GDP and 95 percent&#13;
of its export markets. In response, the Government embarked on a program of economic&#13;
stabilization and structural reform, and implemented an impressive range of measures to&#13;
expand the scope of market transactions. These included price and trade liberalization, a&#13;
mass privatization program, establishment of a two-tier banking system, and enactment of&#13;
new laws and regulations favorable to private economic participation.&#13;
2.    After four years of decline, Mongolia succeeded in reducing inflation and restoring&#13;
economic growth. The growth was led by copper exports and increased agroindustry and&#13;
service sector activities. Mongolia achieved 2.5 percent GDP growth in 1994, and a&#13;
further 6.3 percent growth in 1995. Lower copper prices, however, disrupted growth in&#13;
1996, and the estimated GDP growth rate for 1996 is 2.6 percent. Inflation, which&#13;
reached 325 percent in 1993 fell to 53 percent by the end of 1995, and remained at that&#13;
level in 1996. During 1996, the Mongolian economy was hit by a succession of adverse&#13;
developments that reversed some of the progress painstakingly made over the past years.&#13;
Much of Mongolia's recent economic developments were the result of terms of trade&#13;
shocks. A 25 percent decline in world copper prices in 1996, a 10 percent fall in cashmere&#13;
prices, and further increases in world petroleum prices', induced a cost to the Mongolian&#13;
economy equivalent to 10.3 percent of GDP in 1996, compared to a windfall gain of 8&#13;
percent in 1995. Extensive forest and steppe fires in April 1996 resulted in lower&#13;
agricultural supplies and exports. While the agriculture exports and the copper, cashmere&#13;
and petroleum terms of trade problems are likely to self-correct, the problems in the&#13;
financial and enterprise sectors pose a longer-term threat to stabilization and growth.&#13;
3.    Current Status of the Banking Sector. Mongolia saw a major erosion of public&#13;
confidence in the banking system in 1996, with the collapse of a small private bank and the&#13;
closure of two large banks that held approximately 50 percent of total deposits in the&#13;
country. On December 13, 1996, the Government successfully closed two large insolvent&#13;
banks. The 1996 banking crisis poses severe implications for inflation, financial control,&#13;
and growth in the real sector. The authorities will have to further resolve the banking&#13;
crisis and consistently implement strict macroeconomic policies to restore stability.&#13;
iThe copper sector accounts for a quarter of GDP, half of export earnings, and about a third of overall tax&#13;
receipts. Cashmere is the second leading export item, accounting for about 15 percent of export&#13;
receipts. Petroleum and petroleum products account for 20 percent of its imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -                TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Mongolia's commercial banks are unable to offer effective financial intermediation due to&#13;
a combination of factors: a legacy of government intervention in credit allocation, poor&#13;
commercial banking skills, non-creditworthy borrowers and weak management. The&#13;
banking sector as a whole has become insolvent and illiquid. Many of its largest enterprise&#13;
clients consistently fail to service their debts. All banks have become heavily burdened&#13;
with bad debt, and in desperate need of relief from this debt in order to survive. Loan&#13;
recovery, including debt workout and financial restructuring of distressed enterprises, as&#13;
appropriate, is therefore a prerequisite for building a healthy banking system. A radical&#13;
bank restructuring and loan recovery strategy has been developed by the Mongolian&#13;
authorities, in conjunction with the IMF, ADB and IDA, in response to the crisis.&#13;
4.    Current Status of the Enterprise Sector. Structural reforms are needed to&#13;
enhance the credibility of stabilization, and to spur growth by increasing productivity of&#13;
the real sector. Mongolia's public and privatized enterprises face a variety of problems in&#13;
conducting business, ranging from liquidity shortages and limited access to long-term&#13;
credit, to diminishing markets and acute skills shortages at the micro-level. The&#13;
Government's proposes to implement a medium-term enterprise reform agenda focusing&#13;
on general hardening of budget constraints for enterprises, developing enterprise&#13;
infrastructure and management skills, and accelerating the ongoing cash privatization&#13;
program.&#13;
5.    The Legal Environment. Progress in banking and enterprise reform relies heavily&#13;
on the existence of a transparent legal framework, one which enjoys public confidence.&#13;
Rules of the game for economic activity (concerning property rights, entry and exit of&#13;
business vehicles, transactions, competition and dispute settlement) should be clear on&#13;
paper and implemented in practice by institutions equipped in human and material terms to&#13;
discharge their responsibilities. Since 1991, Mongolia has enacted an impressive set of&#13;
laws and regulations related to the operation of the emerging market economy. However,&#13;
the application of the new laws and regulations and their interpretation by the courts&#13;
remain problematic, largely because of inadequate institutional capacity. As a result, banks&#13;
and enterprises are seriously hampered by difficulties in such areas as contract&#13;
enforcement (including loan collection), secured transactions, and the failure of&#13;
bankruptcy procedures. Whilst legislative reform continues at full speed, Mongolia will, in&#13;
view of enforcement problems highlighted above, have to focus increasingly on the&#13;
difficult task of making its laws work in practice. This will require substantial and long&#13;
term investments in support institutions like the judiciary, ministry of justice, property&#13;
registries and legal education, as well as the dissemination of legal information (including&#13;
legislation and case law).&#13;
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
6.    The purpose of the Project is to facilitate the implementation of key components of&#13;
the Government's reform program in the banking and enterprise sectors, and to foster a&#13;
legal environment which supports financial intermediation. The primary focus of all the&#13;
proposed interventions is to develop effective and standardized procedures for default&#13;
resolution, debt workout and loan collection, and to support bank-led restructuring of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -               TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
distressed enterprises. This will create a valuable demonstration effect. The Government's&#13;
policy reforms in these sectors are being supported by IDA's proposed Banking and&#13;
Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (BESAC), and the Asian Development Bank's&#13;
Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL). Both of these projects are scheduled to become&#13;
effective in early 1997. BELTAC will support the core institutions executing the policy&#13;
reforms over the short term.  The Project is also designed to promote longer-term&#13;
institutional and technical skills development, so that the programs implemented under the&#13;
BESAC may be sustained. BELTAC will provide advisory support, training, and where&#13;
appropriate, materials and equipment for the Trade and Development Bank (T&amp;D bank), a&#13;
newly-established Debt Workout Unit (DWJU) in T&amp;D bank, the State Property&#13;
Committee (SPC), participating enterprises, MOJ, the judiciary and other legal support&#13;
institutions.&#13;
Coordination with Other Donors&#13;
7.    The Project design takes into account completed, ongoing and proposed technical&#13;
assistance activities financed by other donors. These are summarized in Annex I  The&#13;
importance of systematic and continuous donor coordination is one of the key lessons&#13;
learned in project development in Mongolia. Moreover, aid coordination and efficient&#13;
external resource allocation are priorities for the new Government.  Several donor&#13;
organizations, including NGOs, are currently active in the areas of banking, enterprise and&#13;
legal reform, most notably:&#13;
- IMF:  assistance to the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Mongolia in&#13;
macroeconomic management, fiscal and monetary policy, central bank&#13;
supervision, accounting and settlement, and payment systems;&#13;
* ADB: central bank supervision, commercial bank restructuring, equipment&#13;
upgrading and staff training, bank and enterprise accountancy development,&#13;
privatization support, legal reform including banking legislation and training of&#13;
legal professionals;&#13;
* GTZ: rural finance, commercial law development, revision of the Civil Code,&#13;
registration of property rights over immovable property;&#13;
* KFW:  commercial bank skills development; support to small and medium&#13;
enterprises;&#13;
* Other Bilaterals: EU/TACIS (enterprise development, financial, policy and legal&#13;
reform); OECF (financial and enterprise reform); USAID (banking skills&#13;
development and judicial training); UNDP (restructuring of privatized&#13;
enterprises); New Zealand (enterprise restructuring); Asia Foundation, Center&#13;
for Institutional Reform and the Informal Sector (IRIS) (legal training), and the&#13;
Netherlands, Denmark, Australia, Japan, and German NGOs (legal training).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -               TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Project Components&#13;
A. Commercial Bank Institutional Development ($0.6 million)&#13;
8.    This component is a highly targeted  intervention to  support long-term&#13;
development of a single financial institution, as a follow-up to TA provided by other&#13;
donors. This TA will focus particularly on building skills in loan accounting, loan workout&#13;
and restructuring functions of the selected institution, as this has been identified as a&#13;
priority area for external support. Further to a memorandum of understanding between&#13;
the Government, IDA and ADB agreed in May 1996, ADB is taking the lead in policy&#13;
discussion and provision of technical assistance in Mongolia's financial sector to facilitate&#13;
bottom-up restructuring of the banking system. ADB has developed restructuring plans&#13;
for the large commercial banks, and provided preliminary training in accountancy&#13;
development to Ardyn and ITI banks. In parallel with its FSPL, ADB proposes to finance&#13;
long-term advisory assistance and training for BOM's supervision department. This will&#13;
cover financial statement analysis, principles of accounting and auditing, and exercise of&#13;
authority under the recently-enacted Central Bank Law (October 1996). ADB also&#13;
proposes to assist major commercial banks in loan recovery, credit and risk management,&#13;
project appraisal, accounting and auditing, and development of operational strategies. In&#13;
addition, KFW is proposing a program of skills development to three commercial banks to&#13;
enable them to provide effective intermediation to small and medium enterprises.&#13;
Bank Twinning Arrangement&#13;
9.    Experience from several countries indicates that emerging banks may benefit&#13;
considerably from developing financial, business and institutional relations with foreign&#13;
banks integrated in international capital markets.  This arrangement may also assist&#13;
emerging banks in improving operational procedures through access to professional advice&#13;
from  banking professionals practicing in advanced market economies.  Twinning&#13;
arrangements are widely considered the most efficient and cost effective way to develop&#13;
long-term institutional development programs in the banking sector. This component&#13;
would finance the twinning, over an 18-month to 2-year period, of the Trade and&#13;
Development Bank with a reputable foreign bank, with a provision for a possible&#13;
continuing business relationship thereafter. T&amp;D bank is a fully state-owned commercial&#13;
bank, with three branches, and a total of 79 employees. It has the best financial position&#13;
of Mongolia's large banks, with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate safely and&#13;
efficiently. It would benefit substantially from long-term assistance in designing and&#13;
implementing business plans and operational strategies, defining the roles and&#13;
accountability of staff, and workflow.&#13;
10.   The foreign bank would provide long-term  advisory services and on-the-job&#13;
training in strategic planning and implementation, organizational structure and network&#13;
development, marketing plans and customer services, development of new products and&#13;
services, credit management and loan workout, treasury and asset/liability management,&#13;
internal audit, communications and effective use of human resources.  Given the&#13;
importance of transparent financial reporting, the foreign bank will also undertake to train&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -               TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
staff in general international bank accounting concepts and practices, preparation of&#13;
appropriate manuals, use of general ledger systems, and systematic preparation of financial&#13;
statements.&#13;
Debt Workout Capacity-Building&#13;
11.   A Debt Workout Unit (DWU) will be established in T&amp;D bank to recover&#13;
outstanding loans from UB carpet factory, Erdenet carpet factory, Domod carpet factory,&#13;
and Eermel textile company. T&amp;D bank is the sole creditor of these loans which amount&#13;
to 74 percent of its total loans outstanding, and 30 percent of all nonperforming loans.&#13;
The initial mandate of the DWU will be to recover the outstanding loans from these&#13;
companies, through a combination of changes in the terms of repayment with or without&#13;
concessions, sale of assets, and liquidation proceeds as partial satisfaction of the loan.&#13;
Under the terms of the contract for the T&amp;D bank twinning arrangement, short-term&#13;
consultants will assist the DWU in maximizing the recovery on each troubled loan. The&#13;
consultants will review the financial position of the selected enterprises to determine their&#13;
ability to meet the new terms of the loan based on projected cash flows, profitability and&#13;
other credit factors. Based on this analysis, T&amp;D bank will initiate bankruptcy procedures&#13;
and/or develop repayment schedules linked to enterprise performance, as appropriate. The&#13;
objective of these initial workouts, in addition to loan recovery, is to create a core group&#13;
of local experts that can replicate the restructuring/recovery exercise in the years to come.&#13;
The DWU will continue its operations as a permanent department within T&amp;D Bank, to&#13;
provide a model for other debt workout units to be established in other commercial banks.&#13;
Terms of Reference are in Annex 5.&#13;
B. Public Enterprise Financial Restructuring ($0.2 million)&#13;
12.   The Government's enterprise reform program, supported by BESAC, is being&#13;
managed by the State Property Committee (SPC), a high-level independent body of&#13;
Government, reporting to the Prime Minister. SPC has wide-ranging powers to initiate&#13;
and oversee privatization, and public enterprise enterprise restructuring or liquidation as a&#13;
respresentative of Government or dominant creditors. SPC will initiate workout exercises&#13;
for two large politically-sensitive enterprises, the Bagahangai Meat Company and the&#13;
Darkhan Mini-Metal Plant. These are among the largest defaulters to the banking system.&#13;
Under this financial restructuring program, they will be isolated from all sources of&#13;
financing except the budget which will finance limited working capital expenditures. A&#13;
moratorium will be established on their debt-service obligations. SPC will carry out&#13;
viability assessments and recommend liquidation or restructuring, to be implemented&#13;
within an 18 month period.&#13;
13.   BELTAC will finance two short-term advisors to assist SPC in preparing viability&#13;
assessments, restructuring or liquidation plans and debt restructuring programs for these&#13;
enterprises. Thereafter, the advisors would work with the companies to implement&#13;
priority actions identified in the restructuring plan, and with SPC to prepare loan&#13;
repayment schedules, so that the enterpriss can service their debts. The case of Darkhan&#13;
mini-metal plant presents particular difficulties. The plant was financed by a $30 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -                TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
commercial loan from Japan's EXIM Bank, guaranteed by the Government of Mongolia.&#13;
This loan therefore represents a contingent liability on the budget. Japan is continuing to&#13;
provide official development assistance to improve the plant's physical performance.&#13;
C. Legal Reform Program ($1.2 million)&#13;
14.   The Legal Reform Program consists of a series of subprojects, identified by local&#13;
stakeholders as addressing priority areas of reform that require external assistance. The&#13;
subprojects were designed and will be implemented by interinstitutional working groups,&#13;
comprising representatives of the Ministry of Justice, Bank of Mongolia, Ministry of&#13;
Finance, Supreme Court, Bureau of Foreign Investment, and commercial banks. Client&#13;
ownership and continuing participation will remain essential for effective implementation&#13;
of this component, given the broad-ranging and interinstitutional nature of proposed&#13;
reforms and interventions. The subprojects also take into account the TA activities&#13;
financed by ADB, GTZ and USAID, among others. The Program will be implemented in&#13;
stages, based on an agreed annual work program. An initial pipeline of subprojects has&#13;
reached an advanced stage of preparation (see paras 15-17). Further resources will be&#13;
allocated to additional subprojects (see para 18), based on initial outcomes and&#13;
performance indicators. All subproject proposals are subject to IDA's prior approval, on&#13;
recommendation of the Steering Committee.&#13;
Execution of Judgments&#13;
15.   The objective of this subproject is to strengthen the operations of the Bailiffs&#13;
Department under the MOJ with a view to improving enforcement of civil judgments.&#13;
Current problems have resulted in a widespread lack of confidence in the court system,&#13;
particularly on the part of banks. The subproject will finance a study tour to two foreign&#13;
jurisdictions to familiarize Mongolian bailiffs with enforcement procedures and operations&#13;
in other countries. On the basis of this study tour, recommendations for the improvement&#13;
of the Bailiffs Department will be prepared and submitted to the Minister of Justice for&#13;
implementation. In addition, a basic training course for bailiffs focusing among others on&#13;
loan recovery will be designed and held at least once in Ulaanbaatar. The design of the&#13;
course will emphasize sustainability by including a training of trainers module and ensuring&#13;
that the course can be replicated throughout the country. Course design will be based on&#13;
creative teaching methods including role playing and moot courts.&#13;
Collateral Registration&#13;
16.   Registration of property rights and secured interests facilitates and reduces the&#13;
transaction cost of financial intermediation. A functioning and credible collateral system is&#13;
essential to the long-term viability of commercial banking. A prefeasibility study (financed&#13;
by IDA in 1996 under a Norwegian trust fund) has confirmed the complexity of the&#13;
establishment/reform  of such registers in Mongolia.  A working group has been&#13;
established to provide guidance on this subject. In view of GTZ's involvement in the&#13;
registration of immovable property, the proposed subproject focuses on the registration of&#13;
secured interests in movable property. A workshop will be held in Ulaanbaatar to review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -               TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
all legal, technical and institutional issues involved, including the need for clear and&#13;
transparent procedures regarding the taking, perfecting and foreclosure of collateral, as&#13;
well as what is required to actually establish and operate a registry. Specific&#13;
recommendations resulting from the workshop will be followed by the development and&#13;
implementation of a business plan for the establishment of a registry for secured interests&#13;
in movable property. IDA will finance foreign advisors, hard and software required for the&#13;
establishment of the registry and training of operators.&#13;
Insolvency&#13;
17.   A revised insolvency law is under preparation. This process is being guided by a&#13;
working group established for this purpose. A first draft has been prepared and reviewed&#13;
by IDA. Submission of a revised draft to IDA for review is a Credit Effectiveness&#13;
condition for BESAC. The Government expects to submit a draft law to Parliament for&#13;
enactment during the 1997 fall session. The subproject focuses on training and a public&#13;
information campaign to familiarize the public and legal professionals with enterprise&#13;
restructuring and liquidation.. Training courses will be designed and held for trustees (a&#13;
new concept introduced in the draft law) judges and other legal professionals likely to be&#13;
involved in the implementation of the new insolvency law. Course design will promote&#13;
sustainability by including a training for trainers module and will be based on creative&#13;
teaching methods like role plays. The subproject will also finance part of a broader public&#13;
information campaign that is being planned by the MOJ.&#13;
Additional Subprojects&#13;
18.   BELTAC  would support additional subprojects identified by the Steering&#13;
Committee based on evolving needs and priorities, and the availability of funds under this&#13;
component.. In this regard, potential subprojects concern: (a) the development of model&#13;
loan, collateral and guarantee documentation: (b) the training of legal professionals in the&#13;
use of these documents and the application of relevant procedures; and (c) the training of&#13;
legal professionals regarding the recently enacted banking laws.&#13;
Performance Indicators&#13;
19.   Regular monitoring of TA inputs and evaluation of outcomes is essential for&#13;
sustainability of the reform  process.  It should be borne in mind, however, that&#13;
measurement of long-term impacts is less straightforward in an operation of this type,&#13;
particularly one which relies heavily on donor coordination. The performance indicators&#13;
established for BELTAC, subject to agreement with the Government on suitability and&#13;
monitoring responsibility, are detailed in Annex 3, and summarized below. In the case of&#13;
the Legal Reform Program component, performance indicators will be established for each&#13;
individual subproject to be approved by IDA.&#13;

III. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Cost and Financing&#13;
20.   The total cost of the project is $2.3 million, of which $2.0 million is in foreign&#13;
exchange. All costs have been subjected to price contingencies of 15 percent. The&#13;
estimates for consulting assignments, studies and training are based on typical current&#13;
costs for such assignments. The foreign exchange costs will be met by IDA. The local&#13;
currency requirements ($0.3 million) would be met by the Borrower from its own&#13;
resources and from available grant funding.&#13;
Project Implementation and Reporting&#13;
21.   The TA will be implemented over a two-and-a-half year period. Each component&#13;
will be managed by a designated counterpart institution:  (a) Commercial Bank&#13;
Institutional Development--Trade and Development Bank; (b) Public Enterprise Financial&#13;
Restructuring--SPC; and (c) Legal Reform Program-- Ministry of Justice, through the&#13;
Legal Reform Project Unit. Each counterpart agency will make available competent staff&#13;
in adequate numbers to be responsible for coordination and supervision of project&#13;
implementation. Each counterpart agency will monitor procurement and disbursement&#13;
under their component, and maintain records of all transactions, including supporting&#13;
documents for statements of expenditure, in accordance with sound accounting practices&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The counterpart agencies will submit quarterly progress reports in a&#13;
format acceptable to IDA within two weeks from the end of each quarter. In addition, the&#13;
counterpart agencies will submit a mid-term report on project implementation on or about&#13;
December 31, 1998. This report will integrate the results of the quarterly reports and set&#13;
out recommendations to ensure efficient implementation and achievement of project&#13;
objectives thereafter. Reporting requirements for consultants will be specified in Terms of&#13;
Reference.&#13;
Legal Reform Program: Special Conditions for Project Implementation&#13;
22.   MOJ will establish  and  maintain  a  Steering  Committee  composed  of&#13;
representatives of the public and private sector, including ministries of Finance and Justice,&#13;
BOM and commercial banks. The Committee will meet at least on a quarterly basis to&#13;
review component implementation. In addition, MOJ will establish a Legal Reform&#13;
Project Unit for the duration of the project. This Unit will be staffed on a full-time basis&#13;
by at least one lawyer and an administrative assistant, each with qualifications and&#13;
&#13;

The Steering Committee and the Project Unit will be established prior to Board&#13;
presentation. The Unit will be headed by a Program Coordinator; draft terms of reference&#13;
are in Annex 4. The Unit will prepare subprojects for review by MOJ, the Steering&#13;
Committee and IDA.&#13;
23.   Individual subprojects will be prepared according to a standard format, and&#13;
reviewed on the basis of the following criteria: purpose and scope, implementation&#13;
method, and budgetary requirement. The standard format for preparation of proposals is&#13;
based on the following core elements:&#13;
(a)   description of objectives;&#13;
(b)   analysis of key issues;&#13;
(c)   description of ongoing initiatives;&#13;

Project Accounts. All accounts will be audited within six months of the end of the fiscal&#13;
year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. MOF will retain all documentation for at&#13;
least one year after receipt by IDA of the audit report for the year in which the last&#13;
disbursement was made, and would make documents available for review by IDA&#13;
supervision missions and external auditors.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
25.   Selection and appointment of consultants for technical assistance and support of&#13;
project implementation will be carried out in accordance with IDA's Guidelines on&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997. All&#13;
contracts for consultant services valued at $50,000 and above, and for all contracts with&#13;
individuals, regardless of value, will be subject to IDA's prior review and approval.&#13;
Contracts with firms valued at less than $50,000 will be subject to selective post award&#13;

reviews by IDA. Procurement of equipment will be made in accordance with the&#13;
Guidelines for Procuirement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, published by the Bank&#13;
in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996. Procurement of equipment will&#13;
be made through International Shopping. Equipment estimated to cost less than $50,000&#13;
per contract, up to an aggregate amount not exceeding $150,000, may be procured under&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of National Shopping.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
26.   Disbursements will be restricted to the subcomponents outlined above, for&#13;
advisory services and training (100 percent of expenditures), and limited quantities of&#13;
related equipment and materials (100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local&#13;
expenditures--ex-factory cost- and 75 percent of local expenditures for other items&#13;
procured locally). Disbursements will be made on the basis of documented disbursement&#13;
applications, except for expenditures below $50,000 equivalent for goods, consulting&#13;
services, study tours and workshops which will be based on statements of expenditure.&#13;
These statements will indicate the services provided, invoice, customs declaration, and&#13;
evidence of payment.&#13;
27.   To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower will establish a Special Account&#13;
in US dollars at a bank acceptable to IDA to cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures.&#13;
The authorized allocation of this account would be $500,000 million equivalent. At the&#13;
request of the Borrower and, based on project needs, IDA would make an initial deposit&#13;
into the special account up to the amount of the authorized allocation. Applications for&#13;
replenishment of the special account would be submitted quarterly, or when one third of&#13;
the amount deposited has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation&#13;
requirements would follow the same procedure as described in para 26. In addition,&#13;
monthly bank statements of the special account, reconciled by the Borrower, should&#13;
accompany all replenishment requests.&#13;

            Mongolia - Banking, Enterprise, and Legal
            Technical Assistance Credit Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Banking,
            Enterprise and Legal Technical Assistance Credit Project
            (BELTAC) are two-fold. The immediate objective is to
            facilitate the project's implementation, in particular,
            the debt workout and loan recovery elements of the
            government's reform program. The longer-term objective
            is to promote institutional and skills development to
            sustain the reforms implemented under the parallel project,
            the Banking and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (BESAC).
            BELTAC's components are: (1) commercial bank
            institutional development, a twinning arrangement of the T
            &amp; D Bank with a reputable foreign bank, with special
            attention given to advisory assistance and training for debt
            workout capacity building, and advisors to help assess the
            banking institution viability; (2) public enterprise
            financial restructuring aided by four short-term advisors
            financed to help carry out financial viability assessments
            for the two largest public enterprise defaulters; and (3) a
            legal reform program based on a pipeline of subprojects
            covering (a) the execution of judgments, specifically,
            strengthening the Bailiff's office; (b) the
            establishment of a collateral registry for movable property
            to facilitate collateralized lending; and (c) a public
            information campaign focusing on enterprise restructuring
            and liquidation, and training of legal professionals.
