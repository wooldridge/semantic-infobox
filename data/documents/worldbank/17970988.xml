                          Collado, Emilio G.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by T. Wilson and R. McKinzie, Harry S. Truman&#13;
Library, on 1971-07-07&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The first half of the interview addresses Collado's background,&#13;
the various positions held while working for the U.S. Government (US&#13;
Treasury, Federal Reserve Bank, Department of State, and Export-Import&#13;
Bank), and his involvement in the ground work leading to the&#13;
establishment of the IMF and the World Bank prior to his appointment&#13;
in June'46 as first U.S. executive director in the Bank. While in the&#13;
State Department, as Chief of the Financial and Monetary Affairs and&#13;
Development division, he became involved in what eventually became the&#13;
Bretton Woods Conference in the summer of 1944. This, according to&#13;
Collado, was the culmination of a lengthy relationship between Lord&#13;
Keynes [U.K. Treasury] and Harry D. White from the U.S. Treasury as&#13;
well as others from the State Department in preparing plans for new&#13;
international monetary and financial arrangements for the postwar&#13;
world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Subsequently, and immediately prior to joining the Bank he became&#13;
director of the Office of Financial and Development Policy, dealing on&#13;
the 'monetary' side, and very much second to the Treasury, in the&#13;
eventual development of the International Monetary Fund and, on the&#13;
'development' side with what was to become the World Bank, and the&#13;
Export-Import Bank Collado was also involved in the proposal for the&#13;
development of the Inter-American Bank [1940] which failed&#13;
ratification in the U.S. Senate at the time and was eventually&#13;
established in 1958.&#13;
&amp;#12;     Collado stresses the importance of the U.S. Treasury's senior&#13;
role with regard to international financial affairs. The U.S.&#13;
Government's realization during World War II that it can play a much&#13;
bigger role in aid programs. The establishment [in '43] of the United&#13;
Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), due in large&#13;
part to the efforts of Dean Acheson [then Assistant Secretary of&#13;
State]. Lend-lease aid ['41-'45, exceeded $50 billion].&#13;
Underestimating the magnitude of postwar economic problems of&#13;
reconstruction and development bringing about the realization of the&#13;
need for a bigger aid program which in turn stimulated the Harvard&#13;
address [June'47] by Marshall [then Secretary of State George C.] thus&#13;
introducing the Marshall Plan in [April]'48. The U.S. Treasury's view&#13;
of postwar economic conditions and its handling of them, as well as&#13;
the State Department's view. The increasing political and economic&#13;
difficulties between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in light of the&#13;
Communist threat and the effects on aid programs. The Russians&#13;
declining to join the Bretton Woods organizations. The diminished&#13;
support for UNRRA, and Collado's involvement on the working level with&#13;
Lord Keynes et al, in the negotiations with the British.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In mentioning the death of Lord Keynes in 1946 just after the&#13;
Savannah meeting, Collado talks about Keynes the negotiator, and his&#13;
paper published posthumously in the Economic Journal as being one of&#13;
the great pieces of economic literature. And, he briefly talks about&#13;
the CED [Committee for Economic Development, founded in '42].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Collado talks of his tenure at the World Bank and its top level&#13;
leadership. His resignation as not being personal, but rather due to&#13;
the change in management. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act, the&#13;
ramifications of its application, and the troubles he encountered with&#13;
the foreign executive directors and with then President Eugene Meyer.&#13;
Also, the creation of the National Advisory Council on International&#13;
Monetary and Financial Problems under the Act, chaired by the&#13;
Secretary of the Treasury, and his role within. He expounds on the&#13;
anti-Bank and anti-Fund attitude in the U.S. banking community. Opines&#13;
&amp;#12;on President Truman's selection of Eugene Meyer as first President of&#13;
the Bank, as well as on Meyer himself. Gives a retrospective self-&#13;
assessment of his behavior after Meyer's resignation in December '46&#13;
as due to his youthful 36 years. In conclusion, he talks of a proposal&#13;
in the records to appoint him president of the Bank and, how he did&#13;
not consider himself to be an international figure fit for the post.&#13;
