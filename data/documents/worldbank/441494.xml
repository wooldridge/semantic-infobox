            Bankruptcy's role in enterprise
            restructuring : a hammer to turn a screw?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            State-owned enterprise restructuring has
            been slow in the transforming economies of Eastern Europe
            and the former Soviet Union, which some have blamed on the
            absence or inadequacy of bankruptcy laws and procedures. And
            when modeling bankruptcy laws on the best laws in Europe and
            the United States fails to accelerate enterprise
            restructuring, they call for more judges and training or for
            mandatory out-of-court settlements. These prescriptions may
            be based on faulty diagnosis. In fact, bankruptcy laws are
            necessary only if a firm has 1) going concern value and 2)
            multiple claimants within the relevant class creating a
            free-rider problem. Three questions determine whether a
            bankruptcy system needs fixing: 1) Are actual or potential
            value-adding firms getting the funds they need for sound
            investments? 2) Are confirmed value-subtracting firms being
            liquidated? 3) Are the costs of delays in financially
            reorganizing sound but overly indebted firms fairly low? The
            trick in an effective bankruptcy system is to have those
            facing the greatest risk of being "out of money"
            keep a finger on the bankruptcy trigger. These parties
            should know the firm's business, be adept at
            negotiations, and not be plagued by the free-rider problem.
            Such an ideal combination is rare, but laws often reorder
            the pecking order of claims to ensure that it is possible.
