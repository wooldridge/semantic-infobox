Project is designed to promote the development of the productive facilities and resources&#13;
of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and is in the interest of the Federal Republic of&#13;
Nigeria and of the members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said Project merits financial assistance&#13;

for such assistance.&#13;
