1. THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE POWER SUBSECTOR&#13;
The Energy Sector                                 expected to provide an increasing share of generation,&#13;
rising from 29% in 1994 to about 46% by 2000.&#13;
1.1    Country Setting. The Philippine archipelago&#13;
comprises over 7,000 islands with a population of    1.4    Resource Endowment.  Unlike some of its&#13;
about 66 million. The largest island is Luzon, about    ASEAN  neighbors, the Philippines is not well&#13;
104,000 sq. km., with a population of about 38    endowed with indigenous energy resources.  New&#13;
million; Mindanao is next with 94,000 sq. km. and 14    resources being developed (in addition to coal and&#13;
million people.  The only other island with an    hydropower) are geothermal energy and oil, which&#13;
appreciable population density is Cebu in the central    came into production in 1978 and 1979, respectively.&#13;
Visayas region. Philippine electricity networks are    Geothermal reserves are not yet fully evaluated, but&#13;
substantial, and there is scope for optimization by    could exceed 6,000 MW; 900 MW  are already&#13;
interconnection; however the terrain is rugged with    produced and another 800 MW  are expected from&#13;
ribbons of development along island perimeters. Most    projects under preparation or construction. Proven oil&#13;
of the other islands are small, so that efficiencies of    reserves amount to only 4 million tons and have been&#13;

95% of the population, have been until recently served    provide up to 4 trillion cubic feet; further exploration&#13;
by seven separate grids (five in the Visayas alone).   is needed to confirm the size of the field and determine&#13;
While Luzon and the eastern Visayas could be    its economic viability. Potential coal resources are&#13;
interconnected by 1998, interconnection of the western    estimated at about 1,500 million tons, but most of this&#13;
Visayas and Mindanao is not yet economically    coal is low grade and expensive to mine.  Hydro&#13;
justifiable.                                      resources are quite substantial, with a theoretical&#13;
power potential in excess of 10,000 MW, much of&#13;
1.2    Energy Consumption.  Commercial energy    which is in Luzon. In general, the better sites are&#13;
consumption in the Philippines increased from 93.7    distant from roads and transmission lines, and their&#13;
million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) in 1984 to    development has been hampered by intermittent&#13;

of energy demand, followed by transportation, with    primary energy sector institutions fell within the ambit&#13;
32%. Most of the energy consumed (75%) was and is    of the Ministry of Energy. The Philippine National&#13;

economic shocks when international oil prices increase    coal and oil-based products in addition to its primary&#13;

the proposed project. However, unless NPC can also&#13;
cover debt service from its tariff revenues, the financial    5.25    As previously indicated, NPC's approach to&#13;
recovery of the last few years will be lost. Thus, at    tariff setting is to cover as much of its cost structure as&#13;

In this context, if the imbalance thus introduced into&#13;

allowable return on rate base in 1997 and 1999, the       maximum in the range of 10-12%. NPC has a&#13;

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
6.1    The project is an essential part of the power   justification for both reinforcing the transmission&#13;
sector's least-cost expansion plan (PDP95-Annex 3),   network and investing in efficiency measures under&#13;
for which an economic assessment of investments to   circumstances of rapid generation expansion.  The&#13;
2000 indicates an overall internal economic rate of   estimate is based on the following two approaches&#13;
return (ERR) of about 12%. Further, the EHV line   rendering the lower and upper values respectively:&#13;
and the load dispatch center will facilitate the&#13;
expansion of system generation capacity, yielding (a)   (a)    an assessment of the northwest Luzon 500/230&#13;
the economic benefit of providing additional lower cost   kV transmission system where benefits are&#13;
energy to the system, and (b) an improvement in the       limited to the economic value of incremental&#13;
quality and reliability of supply.  In addition the       sales from  Sual, Masinloc and the initial&#13;
subtransmission components will reduce losses and         hydropower development (up to 2050 MW);&#13;
improve the quality of supply to consumers in the         and&#13;
northwestern Luzon and Visayas regions.&#13;
(b)    an evaluation of the overall transmission&#13;
6.2    The project will realize important capacity        interconnection   program   including   all&#13;
savings by reducing reserve requirements by about         components of the proposed project, plus the&#13;
10% (Table 2.4). While the benefit of low-cost power      first and second stages of EHV interconnection&#13;
from the Sual/Masinloc plants is directly attributed to   investments in Leyte and the Visayas.&#13;
the project, savings in reserve capacity are associated&#13;
with the overall EHV transmission grid interconnection    6.4    These two approaches were used because it is&#13;
program which includes, in addition to the 500/230 kV    difficult to separate reserve capacity savings from&#13;
transmission system in the proposed project, the first   interconnection investments.   The first approach&#13;
and second stages of EHV grid investments in Luzon    comprises the principal part of the proposed project&#13;
and the Visayas (para 4.3).  The EHV northwest   (85% of total investment) and part of its benefits, thus&#13;
extension will also facilitate development of hydro    providing a minimum measure of the project economic&#13;
resources in the north, initially San Roque (300 MW)   viability.  The second approach incorporates, in&#13;
and Casecnan (250 MW).  A technical study of   addition to the benefits stemming from the incremental&#13;
alternative  ways  of  evacuating  power  from    sales attributed to the proposed project, the reserve&#13;
Sual/Masinloc determined that the proposed 500 kV    capacity  savings  attributed  to  the  overall&#13;
design for the northwestern extension is the optimal   interconnection program.  Accordingly, the second&#13;
development for an EHV extension taking into account   approach encompasses the full magnitude of project&#13;
the hydro capacity expected to come on line after 2000    benefits and costs, plus additional non-separable&#13;
(para. 2.10).   The development of the NLDC    benefits and costs of other EHV  interconnection&#13;
component would protect consumers through cost-   investments. Estimates are based on the net benefit&#13;

Transmission Grid Reinforcement Project (TGRP)&#13;
Project Description and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
1.     The TGRP is designed to provide NPC by 1998 with the means of operating a major EHV transmission&#13;
grid facility serving over 80% of the electricity demand in the Philippines, by interconnecting over 5000 MW of&#13;
power station capacity in Luzon and Visayas. When the project is completed, EHV overhead transmission lines&#13;
will extend over 2000 km from the 1000 MW Sual power station in Northern Luzon through submarine cables to&#13;
the island of Panay in Western Visayas. Facilities will also be provided to manage grid operations from a National&#13;
Load Dispatch Center (NLDC) located in the new headquarters of the proposed NPC Transmission Company&#13;
(TRANSCO). The project comprises four components as follows: (i) the northwest Luzon 500 kV transmission&#13;
extension and associated system reinforcement component; (ii) the TRANSCO HQ, National Load Dispatch Center&#13;
(NLDC), communications and protection Facilities component; (iii) the Visayas subtransmission component; and&#13;
Techical Assistance to support (iv) implementation of the above, NPC privatization and MIS facilities. The&#13;
following provides a summary of the technical details and the scope of the project including implementation&#13;
arrangements as described in NPC's Project Implementation Plan of September 15, 1995.&#13;
North West Luzon 500 kV Transmission Extension and Associated EHV System Reinforcement Component&#13;
2.     The Bank financed 500 kV transmission line component is designed to complement new investment in&#13;
northwest Luzon of about US$ 2 billion for generation and transmission projects financed by ADB, KfW, Japan&#13;
Eximbank and the private sector. The line will be required to evacuate electricity from the first 300 MW unit at&#13;
Masinloc by end 1997; followed by a second 300 MW unit at Masinloc and a 1000 MW unit at Sual, both planned&#13;
for commissioning in mid 1998. Parallel financing has been arranged with ADB for the 230/500 kV substations,&#13;
and KfW for the 230 kV lines interconnecting Masinloc. During the period of construction of the 500kV northwest&#13;
transmission system NPC will also be reinforcing a number of 230 kV substations supplying the greater Manila&#13;
region subtransmission netwvorks to cater for the increase in demand. Expansion requirements for eight of these&#13;
substations will be financed under the project. In addition Bank funding will provide for additional resources to&#13;
support 500 kV development under the ongoing Leyte Luzon project (Loan 3646-PH) through supplemental&#13;
financing to cover the increased cost of the 500 kV Naga Tayabas line. The project, a schematic of which (showing&#13;
interfaces with components funded by ADB and kfW) is shown overpage. It is designed to be commissioned in time&#13;
for commissioning of plants about six moths ahead of the scheduled dates to evacuate power from the 600 MW&#13;
Masinloc and 1000 MW Sual Power plants details of which are summarized below:&#13;

3.     This US$ 577 million component will be implemented under various turnkey packages to ensure that the&#13;
responsibility managing each component of the project is clearly defined. Taking into account the specialized&#13;
nature of the work, the financing arrangements and the need for competitive bidding, the turnkey packages have&#13;
been grouped as follows:&#13;
(a)    Furnishing and installing about 225 km of 500 kV double circuit overhead lines from San Jose to&#13;
Labrador, and 10 km 230 kV double circuit lines from Labrador to Sual (Bid under three lots and&#13;
financed largely by the Bank loan);&#13;
(b)    Furnishing and installing 5400 MVA 500/230 kV transformer capacity in three substations&#13;
(including 540 MVAR reactors, and 55 switchbays) at San Jose, San Manuel, and Labrador,&#13;
(financed by ADB and Japan Exim Bank - which organizations are also the prime financiers of the&#13;
600 MW Masinloc plant);&#13;
(c)    Furnishing and installing 112 km 230 kV lines and 500 MVA of associated 230 kV substations&#13;
from Masinloc to Labrador (financed by kfW);&#13;
(d)    Consulting Services for Project Management for each component (financed by Bank loan, ADB&#13;
and KfW respectively);&#13;
4.     The scope of the US$ 165 million northwest transmission Bank component is covered under 3 turnkey&#13;
construction contracts and 3 engineering supervision assignments as listed below. Twenty companies were pre-&#13;
qualified during 1995 using the Bank's (May 1995 draft) model pre-qualification documents. Bid documents were&#13;
prepared by NPC with the assistance of Consultants (EBASCO) based on design criteria established under TMP&#13;
study. General conditions of contract are based on the Bank's model document issued as final draft in March 1995.&#13;
Provision is made for contract price variations due to: (i) delays in contract award (in accordance with Bank&#13;
Guidelines - para 2.56); (ii) Aluminum price increases; and (iii) bonus for early construction and penalties for&#13;
delays. One or more contracts will be placed with the lowest price complying bidder, at an estimated contract cost&#13;
including contingencies, as indicated below. Six consultants were shortlisted for supervision of the lines in&#13;
accordance with TOR approved by the Bank. The consultants are expected to be in place in time to assist in&#13;
preparing the project for construction by the successful T/L contractors.&#13;

Proiect Implementation&#13;
11.   The project will be implemented by the NPC PMO, which appointed a Project Director in 1994 responsible&#13;
for both project preparation and the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). At the time of Appraisal the status of&#13;
project preparation is as follows:&#13;
(a)    Consultants are being recruited to assist NPC with overall supervision, project management and provide&#13;
additional technical advice as necessary for checking designs and commissioning. The transmission line survey work&#13;
was completed and cleared by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, which issued an&#13;
Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC). All the land required has been obtained. Twenty contractors were&#13;
pre-qualified for the 500 kV transmission line to be bid in three approximately 80 km sections to facilitate greater&#13;
competition. Contracts will be for supply and erection (turnkey) basis to set a single responsibility for the completion&#13;
of each major component and thereby achieve faster and improved construction. Bids are expected to be evaluated&#13;
for the transmission lines, with contracts to be awarded by end of 1995.&#13;
(b)    The design for the nine 220/138 kV substations required to be reinforced under the project have been&#13;
completed by NPC Engineering and bid documents with bidding expected to take place in December 1996. The&#13;
conductors to be supplied for the Naga Tayabas 500 kV line will be provided to the successful contractor of the line&#13;
financed under the Leyte Luzon project, who is expected to be in place by the end of 1995. There are no resettlement&#13;
issues for the reinforcement measures which will be done in existing substation land owned by NPC. Likewise, since&#13;
the Naga Tayabas line is an existing facility, resettlement issues are not expected to be an issue but in any event will&#13;
be subject to the Bank policies under the Leyte Luzon project.&#13;
(c)    Planning for installation of the load dispatch, communications and protection facilities must necessarily&#13;
await completion of a design study which is expected to be completed in mid-1996. Consultants are being recruited&#13;
in accordance with TOR agreed with the Bank. They will be contracted to complete the investigation, design work&#13;
and bid documents while also verifying the scope and contract packaging of the communications, protection,&#13;
computer equipment and software for implementation. The consultants will also be retained to supervise the&#13;
construction of the NLDC facilities expected to commence about mid 1996. In addition, they will provide layout&#13;
information to NPC's architects who will design the building for the proposed new TRANSCO headquarters in which&#13;
the NLDC facilities will be housed.&#13;
(d)    The scope of the 138 kV line extensions and associated substation reinforcement have been identified with&#13;
arrangements for establishing rights-of-way (ROW) in progress. Implementation of detailed design and construction&#13;
will be handled by a specially trained Contract Administration (CA) groups to be established within the NPC regional&#13;
structure. Consultants have been employed under the Leyte Cebu project (Loan 3700-PH) and will establish the&#13;
standardized designs for contracting which are expected to be available in time for NPC to call bids for the&#13;
installation.&#13;
(e)    The program for Privatization and Restructuring of NPC, including establishment of the TRANSCO, has&#13;
been prepared to determine the needs and timing for further TA support beyond that provided by the ADB (Annex&#13;
17). A preliminary report by NPC consultants (Ontario Hydro / SNC lavalin was completed by appraisal which set&#13;
out the basis for further support for MIS development. Likewise the report by PTI was completed August 2 and will&#13;
form the basis for further technical support to enhance load dispatch operations.&#13;
NPC Proiect Organization&#13;
12.    . A project organization (Chart 5) has been defined to administer and manage the turnkey projects, with&#13;
staff from NPC's engineering department based on covenanted agreements in accordance with the procedures set&#13;
out in Annex 6. Overall direction and monitoring of the implementation will be coordinated by the PD's office using&#13;
NPC's existing Atemis software to consolidate information by contractors and NPC supervision staff. A summary&#13;

of the implementation plans for each of the subprojects is shown on the attached schedule. Quarterly reports will be&#13;
prepared for issue to the various agencies (e.g. IBRD, ADB, JEXIM, kfW, NPC Management, DOE, NEDA)&#13;
concemed within one month of the end of each quarter.&#13;
(a)    The northwest transmission system must be completed before July 1, 1998, to ensure commissioning&#13;
arrangements are ready for Masinloc and Sual plants to be tested. For the northwest Luzon subproject NPC have&#13;
established Project Management office with a total of 76 staff, under a Project Manager in Manila. He will head&#13;
three general divisions: Technical and Administrative Services (6 staff), A ROW unit (30 staff), Project Control and&#13;
Administration (8 staff), 230 kV Design and Construction (9 staff) together with consultants financed by kfW, 500&#13;
kV line construction (9 staff) together with consultants financed by the Bank, and Substations (12 staff) together with&#13;
consultants financed by ADB.&#13;
(b)    The NLDC project will be managed by a unit within the Systems Operations Division (SOD) with&#13;
support by consultants. SOD assignments will be as follows: Project Management including Administration and&#13;
Finance (10 staff), National Control Center Unit (10 staff), Telecommunications unit (14 staff), and Protection Unit&#13;
(14 staff).&#13;
(c)    Details of the management of the Visayas project are to be finalized pending completion of a study&#13;
of the formation of a Contract Administration Group (CAG) which will provide the basis for plans to concentrate&#13;
regional construction under a special local units. Final plans will be reviewed by the Bank during future supervision&#13;
visits.&#13;
(d)    Management of the TA component will be coordinated by the Network and Technology Services&#13;
Department within the Corporate Service group. This has established three units to undertake the recruitment of&#13;
consultants and coordination of their work with other affected NPC operational units. The TA assignments will be&#13;
managed respective under (i) a Technology Services Division (8 staff), (ii) Network Management Division(10&#13;
staff) and (iii) and Enterprises Systems Division (8 staff).&#13;

TRANSMISSION GRID REINFORCEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Economic Rate of Return&#13;
1. The main technical contributions of the proposed project are to increase the transfer capacity of the EHV&#13;
transmission of bulk energy to the major load center of Metro Manila and improve the reliability of the&#13;
transmission system as a whole. These technical improvements would provide economic benefits associated&#13;
with: (i) the evacuation of lower cost energy from the Sual and Masinloc plants and an initial hydropower&#13;
development in Northem Luzon; and (ii) important savings in reserve capacity requirements which would be&#13;
reduced by about 10% as system reliability improves. The first benefit is directly associated to the proposed&#13;
project. The second benefit is attributed to the overall transmission interconnection program which includes, in&#13;
addition to the 500/230 kV transmission system of the proposed project, the first and second stages of EHV&#13;
interconnection investments in Leyte and Visayas. As it is not possible to separate reserve capacity benefits for&#13;
different interconnection investments the project's economic rate of return is calculated for two approaches.&#13;
Namely:&#13;
A.    Northwest 500/230 kV. An assessment of the proposed northwest 500/230 kV transmission system&#13;
where benefits are limited to the economic value of incremental sales from Sual. Masinloc and initial&#13;
hydropower development (up to 2050 MW in total). The cost stream comprises investments in&#13;
transmission and substations of the proposed project, corresponding operation and maintenance costs&#13;
and the cost of energy evacuated from northem Luzon. Approach A comprises the principal part of the&#13;
proposed project (85% of total investment) and part of its benefits. In this respect, approach A&#13;
provides a minimum measure (lower bound) of the project's economic viability; and&#13;
B.    Interconnection Program. An evaluation of the transmission overall interconnection program, including&#13;
all components of the proposed project (i.e., the northwest 500/230kV transmission line and&#13;
substations, the load dispatch center and the Visayas 138kV grid extension) plus the first and second&#13;
stages of the EHV interconnection investrnents in Leyte and Visayas. Approach A is a subset of&#13;
approach B, in this sense approach B includes additional costs and benefits. It considers in addition to&#13;
the incremental sales benefits, the benefits stemming from a reduction in reserve capacity requirements&#13;
(which can be attributed partially to the proposed project but are not separable). Costs include&#13;
investments in the said components, corresponding operation and maintenance costs and the cost of&#13;
energy from northem Luzon.&#13;
2. For all cases costs are expressed in 1995 constant values. Financial flows are converted to economic costs&#13;
by: (i) netting out taxes and other domestic transfers, (ii) expressing import components at CIF prices, and (iii)&#13;
applying a conversion factor of 0.93 to local costs in order to express them in equivalent border prices.&#13;
3. The economic rate of return (ERR) is computed on the basis of the net benefit flow considering benefits and&#13;
costs as identified above. Incremental electricity sales are limited to the future generation of committed projects&#13;
and are valued at the current bulk energy tariff of US.cents 6.98 /kWh, ignoring consumers surplus. The cost&#13;
of energy evacuated from Northem Luzon is valued at US. cents 5.8/kWh. Investment savings from reduced&#13;
reserve requirements (in approach B only) are valued at US$750/kW, an estimate for the weighted average of&#13;
gas turbines and coal plants' capital costs. It is estimated that capacity savings will reach 2150 MW in a&#13;
period of six years, beginning in 1999. Average energy losses of the proposed transmission system are&#13;
estimated at 3.i%.&#13;
4. The intemal economic rate of return of the project is estimated to lie betveen 20.3% and 27.2%. This&#13;
range is based on approaches A and B which render the lower and upper values, respectively. The economic&#13;
viabilitv of the project was tested against three adverse assumptions associated with project risks: (i) 15%&#13;
increase in the investment cost; (ii) a delay of ninc moths in the implementation of the project, including the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

penalties associated to the Sual plant take-or-pay contractual provisions, and (iii) a lower demand growth. In&#13;
the latter case, part of the benefits of the first year are valued at US. cents 2.2/kWh, an estimate of variable&#13;
costs saved in existing plants. In addition, sensitivity analysis was also undertaken for the favorable case where&#13;
the proposed Northwest transmission is used at its full potential, estimated around 3,500 MW. The results of&#13;
the ERR computation and sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table 1. Details of the calculation for the&#13;
base cases of the two main approaches are given in Tables 2 and 3.&#13;

Transmission Grid Reinforcement Project&#13;
Recommended Program To Enhance Load Dispatch Operation&#13;
The following is a list of key recommendations arising from a study of contracting and economic dispatch&#13;
for power producers operating in the Philippines national grid system. The lists will be used by DOE and&#13;
NPC as a basis for formulating a strategy for the enhancement of system operations under the control of&#13;
the planned national Load Dispatch center (NB bracketed information refers to specific sections in the&#13;
Phase 2 Report No R71-95 by Power Technologies Inc. dated August 2, 1995). The list is in the&#13;
recommend chronological order, but does not imply priority of any specific item.&#13;
1. Revise Megallen Utilities Development Corps Transmission Service Agreement to improve contract terms;&#13;
remove explicit wheeling rate definition; and petition ERB to approve wheeling rate outside contract (5. 1).&#13;
2. Revise existing LDC scheduling and dispatch procedures to better accommodate contractual Minimum&#13;
Energy Takeoff Rate (MEOT) considerations (3.1&#13;
3. Implement telemetry and data acquisition capabilities for private producers which are not currently&#13;
monitored (3.5);&#13;
4. Formalize data registration and submission procedures for private producers (3.1.2);&#13;
5. Enhance and expand bid solicitation, evaluation and contracting staff; standardize contract terms and&#13;
conditions. Review MERALCO Power Service Agreement to improve contract terms in future PSAs (4.2)&#13;
6. Reactivate and enhance economic dispatch and automatic generation control capability (3.1.3);&#13;
7. Revise PDP planning procedures with respect to the treatment of hydro resources and MEOT constraint(&#13;
2.6.2)s;&#13;
8. Formalize operating procedures, connection conditions, scheduling and dispatch and metering requirements&#13;
for inclusion in standard contract provisions( 3.1.5);&#13;
9. Enhance performance monitoring capabilities; introduce automatic performance monitoring requirements in&#13;
bid solicitations (6.3);&#13;
10. Study requirements for ancillary services by private producers; implement these through contract&#13;
conditions and scheduling and load dispatch procedures (3.2);&#13;
11. Expand and enhance least cost planning aspects of the PDP process. No particular include a rigorous&#13;
analysis of the key risks as a key element of the decision process (2.6);&#13;
12. Undertake a detailed study of tariff requirements for transmission access and wheeling, select suitable&#13;
tariff structures and petition ERB for approval (5.4);&#13;
13. Organize working group for development of a Grid Code; Develop requirements and framework for a grid&#13;
code; Prepare Grid Code (3.6);&#13;
14. Promote the adoption of an indicative rather than normative generating expansion process; evaluate and&#13;
promote the modification of legal and regulatory restrictions in order to advance the indicative framework&#13;
(2.2).&#13;

Environment, Land Acquisition And Resettlement&#13;
A.    Environment&#13;
1. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) aims to establish baseline information on the existing&#13;
environmental conditions on the area to be traversed by the Project, identifies the significant environmental impacts&#13;
of the project, and prescribes appropriate environmental management measures for the identified adverse effects.&#13;
Topography/Terrain of North West Luzon Component&#13;
2. The proposed Northwestern Luzon EHV transmission project will be erected in the Northern (Region I) and&#13;
Central (Region 111) Luzon. For most of the route the proposed EHV line will be parallel to the existing 230 kV T/L&#13;
connecting Labrador S/S to San Manuel S/S to San Jose S/S. A 67.63 km section will emanate from the existing&#13;
Labrador S/S to connect with the existing San Manuel S/S and will compose of 179 tower sites. The 157.44 km&#13;
section will emanate from the existing San Manuel S/S to connect with the existing San Jose S/S and comprise of&#13;
413 tower sites. The area is divided into two major terrain categories namely gently elevated alluvial terrain. The&#13;
first section will traverse areas underlain by intrusive rocks, sedimentary rocks and alluvial deposits. A total of 17&#13;
tower sites are situated on intrusive rocks, one on sedimentary rocks and 161 on alluvium The longer section will&#13;
traverse areas underlain by pyroclastic rocks, sedimentary rocks and alluvial deposits. A total of 61 tower sites are&#13;
on pryroclastic rocks, ten on sedimentary rocks and 342 on alluvium&#13;
Meteorology&#13;
3. The prevailing climate in the area (Region I and Region III) is categorized under Type I of the Coronas climate&#13;
classification of PAGASA. It has two pronounced seasons: dry from November to April and wet during the rest of&#13;
the year. Rainfall is at a minimum during the months of January and February. Mountains along the proposed&#13;
route affects the local wind regimes throughout the year; thus, the prevailing wind at various synoptic stations is&#13;
different. The prevailing wind at Dagupan is southeast, east at Iba and northeast at Cabanatuan. The&#13;
climatological data gathered from PAGASA stations in Dagupan (1951-1985), Iba (1951-1985) and Cabanatuan&#13;
(1951-1976) indicate an annual mean temperature of 27.8°C, 27.0°C and 27.60°C, respectively. The mean annual&#13;
RH value is 77% at Dagupan City, 79% at Iba and 76% at Cabanatuan City. The transmission line right-of-way&#13;
will go through six (6) perennial rivers namely the Agno, Sinocalan, Talavera, Pampanga, Penaranda and Angat&#13;
and small creeks which are usually dry during summer. River water is used for washing clothes, irrigation,&#13;
quarrying, livestock watering and other general purposes.&#13;
Ecological Environrment&#13;
4. The proposed areas of expansion of the Labrador and San Manuel Substation is currently under rice plantation&#13;
(average yield of 3.02 mtlha, DA, 1993). Likewise, the expansion areas of the Labrador-San Manuel and San&#13;
Manuel-San Jose del Monte T/L route consist mostly of ricelands The vegetation at the proposed San Jose del&#13;
Monte substation expansion site on the other hand comprises mostly of grass shrubs and fruit bearing trees. Oryza&#13;
sativa (rice) is the main crop grown in the lowlands of Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija and Bulacan. Grassland and&#13;
patches of trees are found on the hills site, open lands and marginal lands along the T/L route. The dominant grass&#13;
species identified were Themeda triandra, Imperata cylindrica (cogon) and Saccharum spontaneum (talahib). A&#13;
total of seven (7) birds species, 5 mammals, 4 reptiles and 2 arnphibians inhabit the provinces of Pangasinan,&#13;
Nueva Ecija and Bulacan. Common bird species are Egretta garzetta nigripes, Haliastus indus, Passer montanus,&#13;
Corvus macrorhynchus, Collocalia troglodytes, Dendrocygna arcuata and Megalurus palustris. Sus sp., Cervus sp.&#13;
Rattus mindanensis, Suncus occultidens, and Ptenochirus jagorii were the mammalian species recorded. Common&#13;
amphibian species listed were Bufo marinus and Rana cancrivora. Hemidactylus frenatus, Gecko gekko, Varanus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Pafe 2 of 5&#13;
salvator and Brachymeles gracilis were the reptilian species observed along the proposed substations and&#13;
transmission line route. Five (5) common fish species and freshwater shrimp were recorded in six major rivers to&#13;
be traversed by the proposed EHV T/L namely: goby (Glossogobius sp.), murrel (Ophicephalus striatus), catfish&#13;
(Clarias sp.), dilis (Stelophorus sp.), eel (Synbranchus sp.) and freshwater shrimp (macrobrachium sp.).&#13;
Public Involvement&#13;
5. Information dissemination regarding the project was started in December 1993 prior to the commencement of&#13;
environmental and socioeconomic surveys (SES). Several consultations with local officials and informal dialogues&#13;
with the would-be-affected households were undertaken to answer queries concerning relocation and compensation&#13;
during the environmental inspection and SES survey in January and April 1994 respectively. The application for&#13;
the Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) was submitted to the DENR on February 7, 1994. A joint NPC-&#13;
DENR site inspection was then conducted in March. The ECCs for the project were released by DENR in April,&#13;
1994. However, changes in the S/S lay-outs were made after the actual staking of the T/L towers and additional&#13;
EIA studies had to be undertaken. The revised T/L route and SIS site and supplementary EIA were then submitted&#13;
to the DENR in September 1994 and revision of the ECC was requested. Subsequently, the DENR released a new&#13;
ECC for the project. In September 1994, mayors of all the 28 affected municipalities in the provinces of&#13;
Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija and Bulacan were advised about the project through correspondence.  Project&#13;
presentations were then conducted in 26 municipalities, 12 barangays and for 5 local NGOs. These information&#13;
campaigns/presentations resulted in the issuance of 5 endorsements from Pangasinan, 6 from Nueva Ecija and 2&#13;
from Bulacan. On September 22, 1994, a meeting was held with the landowners of the proposed San Manuel S/S&#13;
expansion site. The discussion focused primarily on the compensation for the affected land. Continuing&#13;
consultations with other affected households to discuss their respective concerns will be undertaken as needed.&#13;
Impacts and Management Measures&#13;
6. In order to minimize the visual impact that the erection of the line will cause, they will be built at an angle to&#13;
the existing highways and not be higher than the mountain range. Environmental guidelines to contractors covering&#13;
civil works including excavator and cutting/filling activities, will ensure that project construction will not cause&#13;
adverse impact on water quality. Spoils generated during construction shall be used as filling materials and the&#13;
surplus will be spread and compacted around the tower sites. All filled areas shall be compacted then revegetated&#13;
to make the area stable. Excess spoils shall be properly contained and deposited as described above away from&#13;
water bodies. Hazards from fire after clearing wvill be prevented by burying the cut vegetation such as dried&#13;
leaves/twigs/branches as mulch or compost materials and by giving away twigs and shrubwood to residents for use&#13;
as firewood.&#13;
Ecological Impacts&#13;
7. No critical habitats such as primary forests, national parks and wildlife reserves will be traversed by the&#13;
proposed line route and substations. Any ecological impacts from the project are expected to occur only during&#13;
erection and will be minor and temporary in duration and will involve ecologically common species of plants.&#13;
Construction of the substation and clearing of the easement corridor will certainly result in the loss of natural&#13;
vegetation and crop production. To mitigate the impacts of the proposed project, construction should be scheduled&#13;
after harvesting of major crops to avoid production losses. Landscaping and revegetation of open and exposed&#13;
areas shall be undertaken immediately after completion of the civil works. Erosion and sedimentation of nearby&#13;
river channels during construction of the project will disrupt biological and ecological processes of freshwater&#13;
organism. The impact however, is temporary and insignificant and construction shall he undertaken during dry&#13;
months.&#13;
&#13;

B.    Land Acquisition And Resettlement&#13;
1.    The project will involve land acquisition, payment of compensation for assets affected and payment of&#13;
easement fees for the right-of-way for transmission lines. About 966 households (4,730 people) will need to be&#13;
relocated. The four components of the project that will require land acquisition and/or right-of-way (ROW)&#13;
compensation are delineated below and are also summarized in Table 1.&#13;
(a)    The NW Luzon transmission component includes a 500 kV/225 km transmission line from Labrador to San&#13;
Manuel to San Jose, and one sub-station at each of the three locations. This component will involve relocation of&#13;
about 600 households. The costs for relocation and compensation are estimated at Pesos 586.6 million;&#13;
(b)    The Visayas subtransmission component includes: (a) Panay IV transmission line (123 kV/79 kIn); and (b)&#13;
Negros IV transmission line (138 kV/73 km). These components will, together, involve the relocation of 53&#13;
households. The estimated costs of relocation and compensation are about Pesos 54.4 million;&#13;
(c)    The Sual-Labrador 230 kV transmission line will affect 24 households.  Costs for relocation and&#13;
compensation are estimated at Pesos 9.6 million;&#13;
(d)    The Masinloc-Labrador 230 kV transmission line, financed by KfW, will affect 89 households. The&#13;
relocation and compensation costs are estimated at Pesos 41.2 million;&#13;

2.     The borrower (NPC) has prepared a consolidation Relocation/Resettlement Action Plan for the project as a&#13;
whole, acceptable to the Bank. The key aspects under this project are:&#13;
NPC has prepared a new Relocation and Resettlement Policy (Annex 15) for transmission projects that will be&#13;
piloted under this project. The proposed policy enhances the framework agreed for the Leyte Geothermal project; it&#13;
has been approved by NP Board;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                                     Annex 14&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
Technical assistance, to continue efforts to strengthen NPC's capacity, were initiated under the Leyte Geothermal&#13;
project. This capacity building effort focused on social impact assessment, preparation and implementation of&#13;
resettlement action plans and community development programs. In addition, the technical assistance will finance&#13;
hiring of consultants to assist with: (a) revision of NPC's right-of-way manual; and (b) development of the&#13;
framework and/or charter for NPC's proposed real estate subsidiary -- NPC Properties Incorporated.&#13;
3.     Proposed Policy Framework for Relocation and Resettlement. NPC's policy for transmission projects was&#13;
until recently limited to providing cash compensation for affected land, houses and crops and a fixed disturbance&#13;
allowance; it did not include measures for resettling the displaced or for restoring their incomes. Further,&#13;
compensation for land, houses, crops and trees was based on municipal "schedules of value" which are often well&#13;
below market and replacement values of these assets. Finally, only those that could demonstrate ownership were&#13;
eligible for cash compensation for land, houses and crops. This means, for example, that those who do not own the&#13;
land on which their house is built -- tenant farmers, households granted use rights by landlords, and squatters - did&#13;
not receive compensation for their house lots and were often unable to find house lots to relocate their houses. By&#13;
contrast, people displaced by NPC's power plants were and continue to be eligible -- irrespective of their tenure&#13;
status - for a resettlement package which includes a house plot with a core house in a serviced resettlement area&#13;
developed by NPC, or its cash equivalent. They are also eligible for livelihood development programs financed and&#13;
administered by NPC.&#13;
4.     To overcome the shortcomings of the existing policy framework, NPC and the Bank have agreed on a&#13;
relocation and resettlement policy for transmission projects (see Annex 15). This policy has been approved by the&#13;
Board of NPC and has been adopted as corporation policv. "Land for Land" compensation, will, however, be first&#13;
piloted under TGRL and other World Bank and ADB financed projects. Its incorporation into NPC's policyis&#13;
contingent on the results of the pilot project. The new policy will provide: (a) compensation at replacement value&#13;
for affected houses, eliminating the current practice of deducting depreciation from the assessed value; (b) to&#13;
affected people the option of obtaining equivalent replacement land or cash compensation at fair market value; (c)&#13;
compensation at market value for affected crops and at economic value for trees (such as coconut, mango and&#13;
bamboo); (d) assistance and/or loans for livelihood development to affected people; and (e) coverage for people&#13;
with weaker tenure status. In addition, to improve the mechanism for asset valuation and reduce complaints of&#13;
"unfair and low assessment" by affected people, NPC will hire competent private assessors.&#13;
Resettlement Action Plans - Key points.&#13;
5.     Entitlements. As per the policy delineated above, affected families will be entitled to cash compensation for&#13;
lost assets, and the costs for demolition, transfer and reconstruction of houses. In addition, they will receive a&#13;
disturbance compensation equivalent to at least two months of income to cover initial income losses. Displaced&#13;
families will have the option of receiving equivalent replacement land, from NPC, instead of cash compz2nsation for&#13;
their land. Finally, displaced families will be provided either a residential lot or its cash equivalent, irrespective of&#13;
their current tenure stature.&#13;
6.    Institutional Strengthening. Project delays caused by social opposition to NPC's projects and delays in&#13;
obtaining environmental clearances, have been principal constraints to NPC's development. This indicates the high&#13;
priority that needs to be accorded to strengthening environmental and social units in the organization. These units&#13;
are currently overworked and are in need of competent staff trained in environmental engineering and social&#13;
sciences. NPC has agreed to review the staffing of its Environmental and Social Engineering Departments and&#13;
advise the Bank of its plans for capacity enhancement. As a first step, technical assistance under the Leyte-Luzon&#13;
project will finance (through grant funds) consultants/advisors to assist NPC in re-assessing the existing&#13;
institutional arrangements for environmental and social assessment work. The second phase of the Leyte technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Paee 5 of 5&#13;
assistance grant will be directed towards building capacity in specific areas identified as priority areas in the first&#13;
phase of the work. As mentioned earlier, this project will provide additional TA to continue and complement on-&#13;
going efforts towards capacity building. In particular, this project will provide TA for: (a) revision of NPC's right-&#13;
of-way manual; and (b) development of the framework and/or charter for NPC's proposed real estate subsidiary.&#13;
7.     Implementation Arrangements. The Project Director will be assisted by Project Managers assigned to&#13;
specific project areas. A special Right-of-way task force will be set up to ensure timely and efficient land&#13;
acquisition and compensation.  Further, implementation teams of about eight persons will be assigned the&#13;
responsibility for every 30 km  segment of the transmission lines; they will support all activities related to&#13;
compensation and relocation. Internal monitoring will be the responsibility of the Project Manager and Director. In&#13;
addition, consultants will be hired to conduct external monitoring and evaluation and prepare reports on a periodic&#13;
basis - every six months during the implementation of the RAPs and a final evaluation report six months to one year&#13;
after completion of the resettlement program. These reports will be in addition to the updates on implementation of&#13;
the RAP that will be prepared by the PMO to be included in NPC's quarterly project progress reports to the Bank.&#13;
8.     Budget. The relocation and compensation costs which include compensation for lost assets and payment of&#13;
easement fees for the right-of-way, are estimated at about Pesos 691.5 million. One sub-project - the NW Luzon&#13;
transmission line - accounts for 91 percent of the entire outlay. Table 2 presents the budget disaggregated by sub-&#13;
project. Experience with other NPC projects indicates, however, that the budgets are not firmly fixed because the&#13;
final unit rates are determined by assessors during implementation and also because they are often negotiated with&#13;
affected people.&#13;

RESETTLEMENT/RELOCATION OBJECTIVES, POLICY FRAMEWORK, GUIDELINES,&#13;
ENTITLEMENTS/ELIGIBILITY AND DEFINITION OF TERMS&#13;
A.    Objectives&#13;
1.    To clear the right-of-way limit of houses/structures and crops/improvements beyond 3 m. In height and the&#13;
proposed substations expansion sites of the same.&#13;
2.     To smoothly and effectively resettle the affected families.&#13;
3.    To restore the economic life of the affected families or better yet to improve it.&#13;
4.     To satisfy the requirements of funding agencies for the humane and orderly transfer of affected families.&#13;
B.    Policy Framework&#13;
1.    Project Design. Transmission line projects and their components shall be designed in a manner to avoid or&#13;
at least minimize displacement and adverse impacts on incomes of the affected population.&#13;
2.     Compensation and Benefits. People to be displaced by land acquisition and/or right-of-way shall be&#13;
compensated fairly of their properties - land, houses/structures, crops and improvements based on the principle of&#13;
replacement value.&#13;
a.     Principles on compensation are as follow:&#13;
1.    Lands to be acquired as sites of substations, cable terminal and converter stations and residential lots within&#13;
the T/L right-of-way shall be paid based on fair economic and market values. The valuation shall be determined by&#13;
an independent appraiser hired by NPC or by government financial institutions (GFIs).&#13;
2.     Right-of-way (ROW) easement fee for agricultural lands shall be paid 10% of the fair economic and market&#13;
value arrived at similar to the process in item I above. However, the lands shall be acquired if the valuation is not&#13;
acceptable to the landowner. If this is still unacceptable, these shall be replaced in kind. Where the affected&#13;
households lose only part of their holdings such that their life style and means of earning are not affected adversely,&#13;
they will be paid compensation only for the affected property. However, where 25% or more of the property is&#13;
affected or where the remaining property becomes unusable or economically unviable, the affected households will&#13;
be entitled to surrender entire holding and ask for full compensation and resettlement benefits. All the affected&#13;
households entitled for relocation will also be offered land-for-land option in lieu of cash compensation. Under the&#13;
land-for-land option the location of plots will preferably be in the vicinity of affected property and/or acceptable to&#13;
affected households. In the case of residential plots it will be of comparable size and for agricultural plots it will be&#13;
of comparable size and of equivalent productive potential.&#13;
3.    Houses and structures shall be compensated based on their replacement value which is the cost of materials&#13;
and labor in the locality at the time of relocation. No depreciation cost shall be applied. The house-owners shall be&#13;
responsible for dismantling the affected house and shall own salvageable materials. However, if NPC does the&#13;
dismantling, salvageable materials shall be owned by the corporation.&#13;
4.     Crops and improvement shall be compensated at fair economic and market value as indicated also in item I&#13;
above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 3&#13;
5.     Tower occupancy fee equivalent to 100% of the fair economic and market value of the area within the ROW&#13;
width limit occupied by steel tower/pole/woodpole cluster, but not less than P600.00 shall be paid to agricultural&#13;
lands that were paid of easement fee only.&#13;
6.     Financial assistance to tenants on agricultural land shall be granted per provision of Executive Order 1035.&#13;
The amount shall be equivalent to the value of gross harvest for one year on the principal and secondary crops of the&#13;
area acquired based on the average annual gross harvest for the last three (3) preceding crop years, provided that in&#13;
no case shall the financial assistance be less than P15,000 per hectare. The tenants in the affected lands shall be&#13;
accredited by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR). Tenants not covered by EO 1035 will also be entitled for&#13;
compensation and other benefits similar to those offered for accredited tenants provided these are certified by land&#13;
owners/local authorities.&#13;
7.     Disturbance compensation shall be given to each affected household equivalent to the daily minimum wage&#13;
in the project-affected area multiplied by 60 days per Republic Act (RA) 7279 or the Urban Development and&#13;
Housing Act of 19921.&#13;
8.     Grant of cash equivalent of residential lot area of either 90 sq.m. (urban), 120 sq.m. (semi-urban) and 200&#13;
sq.m. (rural) with prices based on the fair economic and market value in the project area, or&#13;
Grant of residential lot if there are 10 or more affected households per group/cluster in a common place who&#13;
opt to relocate to an NPC relocation site.&#13;
C.    Compensation Package&#13;
Each affected households will be paid and/or granted the following compensation/benefits:&#13;
1. Payment of land&#13;
2. Payment of houses/structures&#13;
3. Payment of crops and improvements&#13;
4. Grant of disturbance compensation (DC)&#13;
5. Financial assistance to tenants per E.O. 1035, for agricultural land&#13;
6. Payment of easement fee&#13;
7. Payment of tower/pole/guy occupancy fees, if the TAL ROW has been paid of ease,ment fee only&#13;
8. Grant of applicable residential lot or cash equivalent&#13;
9. Participation in livelihood projects in accordance with Energy Regulation 1-94&#13;
3.     Negotiations procedures. Disagreements on the valuation of lands and crops and improvements shall be&#13;
settled by an independent Appraisal Committee composed of representatives from any of the GFIs such as Land&#13;
Bank, Development Bank of the Philippines and the Philippine National Bank and a private real estate expert.&#13;
Further negotiations will be based on the Committee's recommendations and will be finally decided/approved by the&#13;
NP Board.&#13;
All ROW negations for both power generation and transmission liens and substations projects maybe contracted to&#13;
an outside party.&#13;
lDue to the difficulty of ascertaining the monthly average family Income based on SES results (relocatees usually pad their Incomes upon learning of&#13;
compensation package after Information disseninatlon campaign or at times number of respondents are few/not sufficient to get correct figure), this&#13;
has been adopted. Data are taken from the Department of Labor and Employment.&#13;

4.     Re-establishment of Production System. To ensure the well-being of the displaced families, they shall be&#13;
given the priority to participate in livelihood projects per ER 1-94 to be implemented by the concerned local&#13;
government units.&#13;
5.     Existing Laws and Decrees. NPC shall adhere to existing laws and decrees in the grant of necessary and/or&#13;
additional compensation to displaced families.&#13;
6.     Participation of Displaced Families. The affected families shall be informed and consulted during the pre-&#13;
resettlement/relocation plan preparation on compensation package, relocation options and procedures for payment&#13;
and settlement of conflicts/disagreements. Subsequently, they will be regularly informed and consulted in every&#13;
stage of plan implementation. Any request for meeting/consultations with SED shall be coursed through the PMO or&#13;
they may personally come to the SED office as some of them are wont to do.&#13;
7.     Resolution of Conflicts, Appeals and Grievance Procedures. The PMO shall put up an Appeals and&#13;
Grievances Desk within the project site office to be manned by one of its staff to receive and manage/supervise the&#13;
resolution of complaints/suggestions/requests from the relocatees, affected landowners, NGOs, POs and LGUs.&#13;
Right-of-way cases requiring legal opinions/decisions shall be handled by the Land and Land Rights Department&#13;
(LLRD), Office of the General Counsel including legal problems arising from relocations. The Social Engineering&#13;
Department and the PMO will resolve all other relocation complaints.&#13;
8.    Implementation Schedule. The resettlement plan will have a clear implementation time frame. Affected&#13;
people will be compensated prior to resettlement and will be given sufficient lead time (2 months) to move before the&#13;
start of construction works on their properties.&#13;
9.     Monitoring, Internal and External. The implementation of the resettlement plan will be monitored by the&#13;
PMO with the assistance of the Social Engineering Department. A copy of the status of plan implementation will be&#13;
included in the quarterly project status reports to the funding agencies.&#13;
For external monitoring, the Project Director or Manager will recruit a third partly to check the implementation&#13;
results and to evaluate the effectiveness of the resettlement plan. The monitoring group will be hired prior to&#13;
relocation and will be retained until approximately six (6) months to one year after completion of resettlement. The&#13;
group will focus on developing indicators for ascertaining the adequacy and impact of the resettlement plan and on&#13;
establishing the extent to which the standards of living of the affected people have been restored or improved. It will&#13;
prepare and submit to the Project Director/Manager, with a copy to the Bank, a report every 3 months.&#13;

Institutional Support to the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB)&#13;
Basis for Technical Assistance:&#13;
1.     As the energy price regulatory body of the Philippines, ERB is responsible for the rates that may be charged&#13;
for electric power transmission, wheeling, stand-by, back-up or other related services of any public utility in the&#13;
Philippines, including of NPC. For example, ERB is responsible for NPC or other utility transmission and wheeling&#13;
rates and other related charges that would be implemented as a result of the recent DOE rule implementing EO 215,&#13;
which law itself opened the generation market for entry of IPP's. In the future, ERB would also control any such&#13;
charges of a spin-off company such as the proposed TRANSCO transmission entity contemplated by subsidiarisation&#13;
and privatisation of NPC.&#13;
2.     Many of these issues are new for ERB. Prior to 1993, the responsibility of ERB in the electric sector was&#13;
primarily for the retail rates and charges of private electric utilities. Responsibility for NPC rates was only added in&#13;
December of 1992. Staff to provide the necessary analysis was only available finally by late 1994. Most of the staff&#13;
hired, while professionally capable, were not experienced in utility regulation nor in electric transmission matters.&#13;
Other duties were also added to the ERB in the December 1992 reorganisation of government institutions in the&#13;
energy sector, and also only staffed by late 1994. Still further duties have since been added and others are presently&#13;
contemplated by the current session of Congress. Over half of the present staff is thus newly hired.&#13;
Purposes of PHRD Grant to ERB:&#13;
3.     Therefore part of the Philippines Transmission Grid Reinforcement Project is a Japanese Technical&#13;
Assistance grant under the Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) program for institutional development&#13;
and strengthening of the ERB. The TA will recommend and provide means to strengthen the institutional capacity of&#13;
ERB in general, and will specifically strengthen the capacity of ERB to evaluate transmission rates and charges and&#13;
related dispatch issues in particular. The TA completes these tasks through two projects: an institutional assessment&#13;
TA, and a transmission rates TA.&#13;
ERB Institutional Assessment Under PHRD Grant:&#13;
4.     An assessment of ERB institutional strengths and weaknesses has been completed, as to both staff and&#13;
facilities. The assessment of agency shows that the agency is constrained by government hiring rules and salary&#13;
schedules, making it difficult or impossible to hire and retain suitably qualified staff. Of 254 authorised positions as&#13;
of January 1, 1995, about 20 professional positions for attomeys, economists and engineers were unfilled due to&#13;
absence of qualified or in cases even any applicants, and 10 positions in information and data processing were&#13;
unfilled for similar reasons. Most remain vacant. The analysis showed that the minimum staff requirement of the&#13;
ERB for current duties in regulation (apart from antipilferage enforcement) is 300 professionals. Recruitment of this&#13;
level of staff may well be difficult at current salaries. Therefore, as part of a Revenue Fund Bill proposed by ERB to&#13;
Congress, ERB is requesting exemption from these government restrictions and the ability to establish its own salary&#13;
structure. The TA report strongly endorses this action.&#13;
5.     At the same time, using ESL funds allocated to ERB, a training program is being instituted to fill areas of&#13;
support identified by the TA study. This program is hiring at least eight different in-depth training seminars from&#13;
professional training organisations, to be given on ERB premises for local staff. These cover topics including electric&#13;
.utility rates method, regulatory analysis of electric power systems, management analysis of utility systems, utility&#13;
finance and accounting, legal issues, and other relevant topics. Research seminars from established organisations&#13;
with previously completed bodies of relevant research are being hired, and their collections of research purchased for&#13;
the ERB library.  Published sets of regulatory decisions of major foreign regulatory commissions have been&#13;
purchased for the ERB library.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                                   Annex 16&#13;
Paee 2 of 3&#13;
6.    The ERB presently has a main office in Pasig, Metro Manila, of 2500 square meters, and two remote offices&#13;
in Cebu City and Davao, of about 150 square meters each. The actual requirement of ERB, present and minimally&#13;
required future staff of 300, are at least 4500 square meters in Manila, and proportionate increases in the remote&#13;
offices. New space is also needed because the government property management of the existing structure makes it&#13;
barely habitable and non-functional. For example, although ERB pays the government P 1,000,000 annually added&#13;
to the rent for air conditioning, the air conditioning unit in the building has not worked for many years. Rats inhabit&#13;
the space and eat wiring of computers and other equipment, creating fire, health and other hazards, in addition to&#13;
damage to equipment. Lighting is grossly inadequate. The Institutional analysis therefore recommended that new&#13;
main office space be acquired, if possible also in the Pasig area for convenience of staff and public access.&#13;
7.    The Institutional analysis also assessed the equipment used and needed by the ERB, especially the number,&#13;
kind and uses of computers and related information management. The recommendations of a 1993 ERB study of&#13;
computer uses, sponsored by ESL funds, were reviewed and compared to the present condition. Essentially each&#13;
employee should have a computer. While the ERB presently owns 70 computers, it requires at over 200 computers&#13;
for the present staff levels. Every ERB position of government grade 6 or higher in the agency, which is all but 16&#13;
positions, relies on data input, data analysis, or other written documents, in a manner that is very much more efficient&#13;
when done on computer. The agency also presently owns 34 printers, most of the dot matrix type. These are&#13;
relatively slow, and are unsuited as local area network (LAN) servers. Use of a LAN increases efficiency of use of&#13;
attached equipment such as printers. The 1993 computer use study and this one both recommend that ERB install a&#13;
LAN among its machines. Therefore, future ERB printer purchases should be of laser printers, suited to LAN&#13;
application. Using a 4:1 ratio of networked computers to printers, ERB requires at least 50 laser printers for present&#13;
staff levels.&#13;
ERB Transmission Rates TA Under PHRD Grant:&#13;
8.    The larger portion of the PHRD TA is for assistance to ERB in understanding the framework for and&#13;
particulars, of how to assess and set transmission and related rates and charges, including how to properly assess&#13;
generation dispatch issues. ERB PHRD TA consultants will recommend a specific rate method or methods&#13;
applicable to Philippine electric power transmission system transmission rates and related charges. They will give&#13;
specific examples of how to apply these methods in particular rate cases using representative data from NPC and&#13;
Meralco or another representative utility. The Rates TA consultants will also provide training to ERB on how to&#13;
perform the actual computations to apply the rates method.&#13;
9.    As to dispatch matters, the ERB TA will provide ERB with institutional capability to appraise price and&#13;
efficiency effects of the eventual dispatch rules, grid code, and industry structure, that may be proposed for&#13;
NAPOCOR. (A separate TA was let by NPC to Power Technologies, Inc. for work on dispatch issues on behalf of&#13;
NPC under the Grid Reinforcement Project. Among other matters, the PTI work should result in recommendation of&#13;
a particular Grid Code for the operation of the dispatch system. Questions of industry structure are also to be treated&#13;
separately, in the process of privatisation of NPC. The ERB Rates TA will provide ERB the capability to evaluate&#13;
these actions). The Rates TA work will be completed before the end of 1995.&#13;
Related ERB Energy Sector Loan Projects:&#13;
10.   A $650,000 portion of the Energy Sector Loan originally allocated to DOE has now been reallocated by&#13;
DOE to ERB for projects related to ERB institutional development. These funds are being applied in diverse projects&#13;
as listed below:&#13;
Computer software training for ERB personnel in operating systems, data bases, spread sheets and word&#13;
processing;&#13;

SUMMARY OF NPC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (TA) COMPONENT&#13;
1.     ADB Funded Technical Assistance&#13;
(1)    Institutional Support - Accounting Services (US$1.2million)&#13;
This project will review NPC's present accounting system, and its planned restructuring and privatization&#13;
program, and recommend an accounting system which will be appropriate to its needs. The project will (i) design&#13;
a management information system and accounting system which is appropriate to the needs of the holding&#13;
company and subsidiaries; (ii) recommend the extent of centralization that is justified for the accounting services;&#13;
(iii) develop a uniform code of accounts for the holding company and subsidiaries; (iv) develop standardized&#13;
accounting manuals for the holding company and subsidiaries; (v) monitor the implementation of the accounting&#13;
systems; and (vi) train staff in the implementation and maintenance of the management information system and&#13;
accounting system;&#13;
(ii)   Institutional Support - Human Resources/Change Management (US$200,000)&#13;
The restructuring and privatization of NPC will require changes to its organization and use of human resources.&#13;
This will require the transfer of some personnel to subsidiaries, and may have to be accompanied by training to&#13;
impart new skills. The privatization exercise will lead to an optimization of its present human resources, and may&#13;
require reduction in staff. In the latter case, plans must be prepared to assist affected persons in obtaining gainful&#13;
employment. Assistance is to be provided in (i) drafting a policy statement on the principles and goals to retain&#13;
staff; (ii) determining staffing requirements after taking into consideration practices in similar utilities and the&#13;
need to avoid duplication; (iii) preparing a master plan for human resource deployment and the associated&#13;
training needs; (iv) determining remuneration levels; (v) determining mechanisms for the preservation of rights&#13;
and benefits of persons transferring to subsidiaries; (vi) establishing guidelines for an employee stock ownership&#13;
scheme; and (vii) recommending a system for human resource record keeping;&#13;
(iii)   Institutional Support - Valuation of Plant in Service (US$1.3 million)&#13;
Covenants with multilateral lending institutions require NPC to perform a full-scale valuation of its plant in&#13;
service every 4 years. The last full valuation was performed in 1992 therefore another valuation is due in 1996.&#13;
The 1992 valuation concentrated on power plants. Work on transmission assets was limited and no valuation&#13;
was performed for buildings. Since up to date valuations have a direct bearing on the valuation of a subsidiary's&#13;
equity, it is important that these values be correct. The valuation must also be suitable for establishing the rate&#13;
bas of each company, and must be acceptable to regulatory bodies and the Security and Exchange Commission.&#13;
The work to be performed would include (i) valuation of production plants; (ii) valuation of each transmission&#13;
line 69 kV or higher in areas served by NPC; (iii) valuation of each substation and switching station in the NPC&#13;
system; (iv) valuation of all NPC owned buildings; and (v) ensuring that values have been correctly recorded in&#13;
the books of account.&#13;
(iv)   Institutional Support - Wheeling Tariffs (US$l150000)&#13;
Initially the transmission subsidiary company (TRANSCO) will have to face high operating costs attributable to&#13;
the 69kV sub-transmission systems which represent over 70% of the circuit length of all transmission lines. It is&#13;
expected that a substantial part of the 69kV systems will eventually be transferred to distribution utilities. A&#13;
mechanism is needed to demonstrate transparently that wheeling tariffs to be charged by TRANSCO cover only&#13;
its cost and a fair return. Assistance is needed to (i) develop a transparent mechanism to calculate wheeling&#13;
charges; (ii) design a financial model to facilitate transparent calculations of tariffs which is suited to changing&#13;
conditions; and (iii) develop adequate programs to calculate load flows and losses, and a dispatch system that can&#13;
record all parameters pertinent to costs.&#13;
&#13;

Paze 2 of 5&#13;
(v)    Institutional Support - Tools for Financial Evaluations (US$25.000)&#13;
Assistance is needed in the development of a computerized financial model that will evaluate the financial&#13;
performance of each subsidiary company, and consolidate these results into the holding company. The model&#13;
should be flexible and capable of calculating several types of dynamic financial scenarios and tariffs, and should&#13;
be able to (i) compute rates of return on rate base and internal rates of return given various levels of loads, tariffs,&#13;
O&amp;M costs, fuel costs and amortization; (ii) compute revenue requirements for different returns; (iii) consider&#13;
differing borrowing and debt service scenarios; (iv) provide a cash flow analysis; (v) have means of recognizing&#13;
local and foreign exchange investments and costs; and (vi) be capable of checking important financial and&#13;
operating ratios and guidelines.&#13;
(vi)   Formation of Transmission Subsidiary (US$500,000)&#13;
As part of its restructuring and privatization program, NPC intends to convert its transmission operations into a&#13;
separate subsidiary company in two distinct phases. Phase I would involve forming a separate transmission&#13;
profit center within its organization, and transferring the functional responsibility for operation of the&#13;
transmission network to this new profit center. NPC envisages work in Phase I to include decisions regarding the&#13;
industry and business structure; organizational and staffing requirements and allocations; identification of asset&#13;
boundaries and compilation of asset records; review, amendment and implementation of operating procedures;&#13;
costs and revenue analysis and budgeting and the preparing of a preliminary business plan. NPC would execute&#13;
the work in Phase I with the assistance of consultants.&#13;
NPC has asked the Bank is consider providing technical assistance (TA) of about $500,000 equivalent for Phase&#13;
II of the exercise, which would involve the actual formation of the transmission subsidiary company. Phase II&#13;
would build on the work performed during Phase I, and would involve refining the organizational structure of the&#13;
subsidiary; drafting its detailed business plan; recommending technical interfaces with industry participants;&#13;
preparing financial projections and capital investment programs; ascertaining funding requirements and&#13;
recommending the needed debt/equity mix; developing the regulatory structure in which the subsidiary would&#13;
operate; and identifying other actions needed to enable the subsidiary to operate.&#13;
2.     Other Technical Assistance Funded by NPC&#13;
(i)    Stakeholders analysis - An evaluation of the NPC's Social Development Program - (US$100,000)&#13;
Social responsibility dictates that the NPC consider the different stakeholders in policy formulation and program&#13;
implementation.  This study shall therefore identify the different stakeholders of NPC and analyze their&#13;
relationship with NPC.  It shall also evaluate the existing community relations scheme to determine its&#13;
effectiveness and sustainability as a community based development strategy. The TA shall be used to assist in&#13;
the conduct of in-house seminar-workshop that will train local personnel in the stakeholder analysis process.&#13;
Principles as well as practical learning through case studies, as well as prescriptive tools for managing, will be&#13;
discussed. Workshops are focused on experiential learning and surfacing of stakeholder issues confronting the&#13;
Corporation. Given the nationwide scope of NPC operations, it shall limit its scope of analysis to the Head&#13;
Office and select plants in the three regional centers.&#13;
(ii)    Training Programs/Seminars/Workshops/Fact-Finding Missions - (US$ 300.000)&#13;
Select groups of NPC staff members will attend training programs/seminars/workshops being conducted by the&#13;
International Management Group, Financial Engineering Institute, Euromoney, among others. They will also&#13;
participate in fact finding missions, hands-on training, familiarization studies in selected electric utilities which&#13;
have undergone restructuring and privatization. The TA will provide them with vital and additional skills&#13;
&#13;

necessary to the various activities involved in the restructuring and privatization program of NPC. Consequently,&#13;
these will ensure its smooth, successful and cost-effective implementation.&#13;
(iii)   Energy Center Project Study - NPC Efficiency and Reliability Department - (US$400.000)&#13;
Energy demand by the year 2005 is estimated to increase to about 16,256 MW with 6.3 M households being&#13;
electrified nationwide. NPC's responsibility is to provide information on energy-efficient technologies accessible&#13;
through building an Energy Center which will showcase working displays of technologies such as advanced&#13;
lighting, air conditioning, glazing, building envelopes and system controls to aid architects, engineers, designers,&#13;
owners and developers as well as the household residents. The Center will realize the effectiveness through the&#13;
efficient utilization as well as the reduction of electricity consumption nationwide with considerable growth in the&#13;
country's GNP. It will also provide an energy resource library to serve as a market of new ideas and information.&#13;
The TA will finance consultants to provide the latest information as well as appropriate demonstration&#13;
methodology and to determine the energy-saving technologies and/or opportunities to be considered.&#13;
(iv)   Integrated Resource Planning Workstation - (US$500,000)&#13;
Significant structural changes being considered to the power sector in the Philippines will have profound effect on&#13;
the way the system is planned. The planning process has several areas for improvement ranging from&#13;
enhancements to the existing legal framework to changes to the specific system planning methods and procedures.&#13;
The TA will be used to finance consulting services together with system planning tools and softwares to expand&#13;
and enhance the capability of system planners to pursue a more in-depth analysis of least cost system expansion&#13;
plan as well as to allow the conduct of more sensitivity studies considering all resources available. A computer&#13;
model is required for analyzing bids between competing projects in order to demonstrate and document the factors&#13;
prompting the choice for generation additions. Besides being a tool for analyzing competitiveness and economic&#13;
value within power pooling environments, the model must also handle all types of thermal, hydro, and renewable&#13;
resources as well as all demand-side management programs such as direct load control, efficient lighting&#13;
programs and numerous others. It will be used to determine or illustrate the merit of building power generation&#13;
facilities to serve export markets or determine the benefits of imports (or establish the price for imports to be&#13;
economic).&#13;
(v)    Transmission Lines Reliability Improvement Study - (US$600.000)&#13;
The project is aimed at assisting NPC identify and determine shortcomings and weaknesses of the current T/L&#13;
operations and maintenance practices by conducting a comprehensive review of the existing O/M policies,&#13;
procedures, methods, techniques, and technologies being employed. Transmission line reliability is one major&#13;
area that is worth looking into with an outside assistance because of its implication on the operational and&#13;
financial performance of the Corporation. It is an area where major improvements will be substantiallv rewarded&#13;
in terms of savings and reduction in revenue loss due to unplanned line outages. The benefits that will be reaped&#13;
from this undertaking are so substantial that even a 50% reduction in unserved energy due to transmission line&#13;
outages will lead to the realization of $7.5M in additional revenue over the next five years. The TA will be used&#13;
to acquire expert services to look into the current methods, practices and technologies being employed to maintain&#13;
and operate our transmission system will give us an opportunity to view the system from the vantage point of an&#13;
outsider. The consultant should be able to determine and identify factors which cause unserved energy levels way&#13;
beyond our counterpart in other countries. Moreover, he should be able to recommend appropriate solutions that&#13;
will result in the reduction of unserved energy to the level of other utilities. The recommended solutions should&#13;
also result in the enhancement of the present system as well as the T/L upgrading program under the PDP&#13;
masterplan.&#13;

(vi)   Investor Relations Services - Privatization and Restructuring External Office - (US$3 10.000)&#13;
Under this TA, NPC will commission a consulting firm to provide crossborder investor relations services in order&#13;
to build the value of its securities that will be sold to the public and thus maximize the proceeds for the&#13;
Corporation. While these services will be timed to coincide with the schedule of public securities/offering, other&#13;
services such as building NPC's in-house expertise in capital markets by conducting training programs/seminars,&#13;
research and identification of opportunities and obstacles related to NPC's public equity and debt securities&#13;
offerings, will also be undertaken by the consultant.&#13;
(vii)   Property Appraisal and Titling of the Land and Land Rights of NPC - (US$200,000)&#13;
NPC presently holds clear titles to only approximately twenty percent of the land it owns. Normally, this would&#13;
not present any difficulty to a government corporation. However, with NPC's privatization progran, proper&#13;
documentation of its properties becomes necessary. In addition, maintenance of adequate records of these&#13;
properties should be developed, specially if it pursues its plan of creating a separate real estate subsidiary not&#13;
only to manage these properties but likewise to cievelop the same. The TA will be used to pursue two main&#13;
objectives: (1) to have all NPC land and land rights properly surveyed, appraised and titled; and (2) to develop an&#13;
adequate record of the land and land rights of NPC. This project shall cover all land and land rights which NPC&#13;
owns all over the Philippines. Among the requirements needed in the pursuit of these objectives are the following:&#13;
(a) identify, describe, locate and measure the land; (b) determine the more expeditious approach(es) to&#13;
obtain titles to the land and land rights and pursue the titling of the same; (c) make an assessment of the&#13;
fair value of the land through recognized valuation procedures; (d) develop and maintain a continuous&#13;
property record for the land and land rights related to NPC properties.&#13;
(viii)  Environmental Management Program - (US$250,000)&#13;
Environmental management programs will provide a framework for operating NPC power facilities in&#13;
compliance with corporate environmental policies and applicable regulatory requirements. The TA will&#13;
provide guidelines for establishing an environmental management program.  It will identify key&#13;
components of a comprehensive environmental management program as identified and established by&#13;
NPC.  It also will provide human resource requirements which are essential to the effective&#13;
implementation of the program.  Although NPC  has established a corporate policy prioritizing&#13;
environmental compliance, there are numerous practical reasons for implementing a comprehensive&#13;
environmental management program. The program might consist of all or several of the following&#13;
components: (a) environmental Management Policies and Programs; (b) minimizing Environmental&#13;
Liabilities; (c) emergency Response and Contingency Planning; (d) environmental Auditing&#13;
Program/Preparing for ISO 14000. The objectives will be to (a) help NPC recognize and understand the&#13;
strategic and operational reasons for implementing an environmental management system; (b) look at the&#13;
various tools and approaches NPC can use to develop an environmental management system; (c) identify and&#13;
establish attainable goals that are acceptable corporate wide and integrate them into daily operations; (d) ensure&#13;
that the Program at a minimum achieves regulatory compliance; (e) create a mechanism or system designed to&#13;
control costs of the program; (f) emphasize long range planning versus crisis response; (g) integrate a systems&#13;
approach which allows for measurement of Program success&#13;
(ix)   Project Management Professional Program for NPC Personnel - (US$300,000)&#13;
The objective of this program to be financed under a TA program, is to prepare a select group of Project&#13;
Managers (i.e. 10 NPC personnel) in meeting challenges of managing projects, both from within and outside the&#13;
organization, using state-of-the-art tools and proven management techniques. The program duration will be three&#13;
months at an institute offering training for certification under the US Project Management Institute. The program&#13;
&#13;

            Reinforcement Project

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Transmission
            Grid Reinforcement Project are to: 1) evacuate power from
            major generation plants at Sual and Masinloc, both expected
            to be operational in 1998; 2) reinforce overloaded
            substations and extend the extra high voltage (EHV) grid in
            Northwest Luzon and Western Visayas; and 3) strengthen the
            transmission system and load dispatch operations to support
            creation of an autonomous transmission subsidiary (TRANSCO),
            which may later be privatized. The project has four main
            components: 1) improvement of the trasmission in Northwest
            Luzon; 2) installation of a new National Load Dispatch
            Center (NLDC) including communications, metering, and
            protection equipment in Luzon and the Visayas; 3)
            reinforcement of the systems in Negros, Panay and Cebu ; and
            4) provision of experts services and equipment.
