1. ABSOLUTE POVERTY IN CHINA&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   China is widely recognized for its achievements in reducing absolute poverty&#13;
since the adoption of a broad program of rural economic reforms beginning in 1978. It is&#13;
estimated that, since that year, some 184 million Chinese escaped absolute poverty and&#13;
that the share of total population living in absolute poverty declined to less than 10&#13;
percent. The form of poverty also changed over this period, from large numbers of poor&#13;
spread widely across the countryside to pockets of poverty in remote resource-deficient&#13;
areas. This change in the form of poverty required a change in the Government's&#13;
approach to reducing poverty, and the Bank Group has been an active participant in the&#13;
design of the Government's new national strategy for reducing absolute poverty in the&#13;
1990s. As one of several means of operationalizing that new strategy, the Government of&#13;
China has requested Bank Group assistance in financing a poverty reduction project in&#13;
the poorest upland counties of the Qinba mountains area of Sichuan and Shaanxi and the&#13;
Loess Plateau area of southern Ningxia.&#13;
B. RURAL ABSOLUTE POVERTY&#13;
1.2   Background. Rural economic reforms, including the adoption of the production&#13;
responsibility system, the dismantling of the commune system, agricultural product price&#13;
increases and market liberalization, were associated with dramatic rural economic growth&#13;
during 1978-85. The 1992 Bank Group study, China: Strategies for Reducing Poverty in&#13;
the 1990s (hereafter, Strategies),' concluded that broad participation in that reform-driven&#13;
rural economic growth brought about the tremendous reduction in absolute poverty from&#13;
roughly 270 million poor in 1978 to about 100 million in 1985, or from one third to about&#13;
one tenth of total rural population. Average rural per capita income grew at an average&#13;
annual rate of 13 percent in real terms during this period, and increased a total of more&#13;
than 140 percent. The gross value of agricultural output increased by a total of 60 percent&#13;
in real terms, at an average annual rate of 7 percent, or more than double the total growth&#13;
and rate of the previous decade. Perhaps most impressive was the increase in township&#13;
and village enterprise (TVE) output and employment levels. TVE output values appear to&#13;
have increased fivefold in real terms during 1978-85 (though part of this increase is&#13;
explained by a broadening of the definition of TVE beginning in 1984), and employment&#13;
more than doubled from 28 to 70 million jobs. These trends in rural economic growth&#13;
and absolute poverty are summarized in Table 1.1.&#13;
The report, China: Strategies for Reducing Poverty in the 1990s (Washington, DC: The World Bank,&#13;
1992) is available to the public.&#13;

1.3   Correlates of Poverty. Absolute poverty in China is now concentrated in&#13;
resource-constrained remote upland areas. Since virtually all of China's rural population&#13;
received land use rights as part of the implementation of the production responsibility&#13;
system during the early 1980s, there are few if any landless laborers. Instead, the&#13;
majority of the rural poor are now concentrated in resource-deficient areas, and comprise&#13;
entire communities located mostly in upland sections of the interior provinces of&#13;
northern, northwestern and southwestern China. Although these poor have land use&#13;
rights, in most cases the land itself is of such low quality that it is not possible to achieve&#13;
subsistence levels of crop production. Consequently, most poor consume grain and other&#13;
subsistence foods beyond their own production levels, and are negatively affected by&#13;
price increases for these products. The poorest households are typically those further&#13;
disadvantaged by high dependency ratios, ill health and other difficulties. Minority&#13;
peoples are known to represent a highly disproportionate share of the rural poor.&#13;
Available evidence does not suggest that women are greatly overrepresented among the&#13;
poor, though poverty certainly does exacerbate societywide problems of lower rates of&#13;
female participation in education, higher relative female infant mortality rates, and higher&#13;
rates of maternal mortality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.4   The educational and health status of China's remaining absolute poor is&#13;
deplorable. At least 50 percent of the boys in some of China's poorest natural villages&#13;
and, particularly in some minority areas, nearly 100 percent of the girls do not attend&#13;
school and will not achieve literacy. The infant mortality rate and maternal mortality&#13;
ratio in very poor counties-which exceed 10 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively-are&#13;
at least 50 to 100 percent greater than the national average, and are much greater yet in&#13;
the poorest townships and villages. Incidence of several infectious and endemic diseases,&#13;
including tuberculosis and iodine deficiency disorders, is concentrated in poor and remote&#13;
areas. Roughly 50 percent of children in households at or below the absolute poverty line&#13;
are at least mildly malnourished (stunted), and iron, vitamin A, and other micronutrient&#13;
deficiencies remain a severe problem among the poor. As many as 90 percent of poor&#13;
children suffer chronic worm infections.&#13;
1.5   Recent Trends. A number of macroeconomic developments stymied concerted&#13;
government efforts to reduce poverty during the second half of the 1980s: (a) sharply&#13;
increased prices for grain and other subsistence goods adversely affected the real incomes&#13;
of the majority of the rural poor; (b) rapid growth of the working-age population&#13;
exceeded the expansion of employment opportunities, contributing to a temporary&#13;
worsening of rural underemployment (during 1989-90); (c) economic growth was greater&#13;
in the higher-income coastal provinces than in the lower-income inland northwestern and&#13;
southwestern provinces; and (d) rural income levels stagnated during the second half of&#13;
the 1980s (the average annual growth rate of real per capita rural income declined to only&#13;
1 percent during 1985-90).  In addition, given the limited revenues of poor-area&#13;
governments and in the absence of adequate levels of appropriately earmarked funding&#13;
from higher levels of government, poor-area local governments are unable to support&#13;
adequate social services.&#13;
1.6   The key obstacle to reducing poverty during 1985-90, however, was the absence&#13;
of meaningful levels of agricultural growth and rural enterprise development in the&#13;
upland areas. Many of the rural poor in 1978 resided in less remote and less hilly areas,&#13;
where increased application of fertilizer, irrigation, better seed and other modern inputs&#13;
could bring about rapid productivity gains, and so were able to participate in the rapid&#13;
agricultural growth of 1978-84. However, the quick reductions of poverty through&#13;
agricultural growth were largely exhausted by end-1984. Most of the residual poor have&#13;
remained trapped in more remote upland areas where agricultural productivity gains have&#13;
proven far more problematic. Measured on a per capita basis, output of grain and&#13;
subsistence foods in such areas failed to sustain any significant increase during the 1980s.&#13;
Although the agriculture sector did expand in real terms during 1985-89, increased output&#13;
of nongrain crops and animal and aquatic products, products that few of the poor either&#13;
produce or consume in significant quantities, accounted for virtually all of the modest&#13;
growth that did occur. By comparison, the very strong annual growth during 1978-84 of&#13;
per capita production of grain and oilseeds-which are the subsistence crops of most&#13;
immediate importance to the poor-tumed negative during 1985-89.&#13;
1.7   TVEs, an important source of employment in the rural economy as a whole, have&#13;
developed very slowly in China's poorest areas. In the early 1980s, TVE employment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
actually decreased in poor areas as the commune system was dismantled and workers&#13;
could no longer be paid in work points instead of cash. Employment rose only after a&#13;
1984 policy initiative supporting private rural enterprise opened opportunities for small,&#13;
family firms particularly suited to the small market niches available in poor areas.&#13;
However, by 1990 only 4 percent of the rural labor force in China's 120 poorest counties&#13;
had found employment in rural enterprises, in contrast to the 22 percent finding such&#13;
employment in the nation as a whole. Restraints on labor mobility were relaxed during&#13;
the 1980s, enabling an increasing number of the rural poor to share in national TVE&#13;
growth by migrating to employment opportunities where they occur. Unfortunately, after&#13;
tremendous growth during 1978-88, TVE employment declined in 1989 and 1990 in&#13;
response to the Government's strong deflationary measures implemented in those two&#13;
years. It is believed that the absolute poor were among the first to lose their jobs during&#13;
the temporary decline in TVE employment.&#13;
1.8    Current Status.  Official government estimates indicate that the number of&#13;
absolute poor declined to about 65 million, or about 5 percent of total population, by&#13;
1995. Very strong overall economic growth, coupled with a resurgence of rural income&#13;
growth and TVE employment during 1990-95, support the Government's reports of&#13;
continued declines in absolute poverty during the 1990s.? As shown in Table 1.2, the&#13;
growth rate of real rural income recovered from only 1 percent during 1985-90 to more&#13;
than 5 percent during 1990-95. TVE employment, having declined in 1989 and in 1990,&#13;
also increased sharply during 1990-95, expanding by more than 7 million jobs each year&#13;
on average. Grain production also increased strongly during 1990-95, leading to a&#13;
temporary decline in the market price of grain with consequential benefits for the&#13;
absolute poor.&#13;

2 Strategies estimated the incidence of absolute poverty for each year 1978 and 1980-90. A simple&#13;
extension of Strategies' methodology-viz., inflating the 1990 rural absolute poverty line (after&#13;
adjustment to account for changes in the State Statistical Bureau's (SSB) calculation of rural income&#13;
beginning in 1990) by the rural consumer price index-suggests that rural absolute poverty declined to&#13;
about 70 million in 1995. The Bank Group's Policy Research Departnent (Poverty and Human Resources&#13;
Division; PRDPH) has initiated work with SSB to establish an updated methodology for estimating&#13;
poverty in the 1 990s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. THE GOVERNMENT'S POVERTY REDUCTION PROGRAM&#13;
1.9  Institutions. The Chinese Government has a strong commitment to poverty&#13;
reduction, and most government ministries and agencies have special poverty reduction&#13;
responsibilities and projects. The Ministry of Civil Affairs provides disaster relief and&#13;
income maintenance support, and coordinates the distribution of relief grain through the&#13;
Ministry of Internal Trade's Grain Bureau system. The State Education Commission and&#13;
the Ministry of Public Health administer some special programs to improve the education&#13;
and health status of the poor. The recently established Agricultural Development Bank of&#13;
China (ADBC) offers subsidized loans for poor-area development through a variety of&#13;
funds administered by provincial bank branches and their networks of county- and lower-&#13;
level banks (until mid-1994, these funds were administered by the Agricultural Bank of&#13;
China and several other banks). The Regional Office of the State Planning Commission&#13;
administers a Food-for-Work Program, which assists with the building of roads and riverine&#13;
transport, drinking water systems, irrigation works and other capital construction in poor&#13;
areas. In addition, each of 27 central ministries and agencies has its own special poor-area&#13;
project and every province has its own specially-funded programs.&#13;
1.10 The State Council's Leading Group for Poverty Reduction (LGPR) was&#13;
established in 1986 in part to provide greater coherence to these many poverty reduction&#13;
initiatives and, in particular, to expedite economic development in the poor areas. Since&#13;
its establishment, LGPR and its executive agency, the Poor Area Development Office&#13;
(PADO), has emerged as the principal advocate of China's rural poor and is now the key&#13;
agency responsible for coordinating the nation's more than $1 billion in annual funding&#13;
for poverty reduction programs. The State Council funds another four poverty reduction&#13;
units that operate within the LGPR orbit: the China Development Foundation for Poor&#13;
Areas, the Cadre Training Center, the Training Center Office, and the Economic&#13;
Development Service Center. Provinces, prefectures, and counties have all established&#13;
Leading Groups and PADOs after the central model, and many townships have a&#13;
"designated person" to handle poverty reduction work.&#13;
1.11  Strategy. While continuing preexisting rural social and relief services, the&#13;
poverty reduction strategy adopted during the Seventh Five Year Plan (1986-90)&#13;
introduced a new emphasis on economic development programs in the poor areas. The&#13;
Government's commitment to sustained efforts to eradicate poverty also figured&#13;
prominently in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95). The Eighth Five-Year Plan&#13;
reconfirmed and extended LGPR's central role as the coordinating body responsible for&#13;
poverty measurement and research, project planning and monitoring, and management&#13;
not only of domestic funding but of bilateral and multilateral assistance for poverty&#13;
reduction. The poverty reduction strategy announced in the Eighth Five-Year Plan&#13;
highlighted (a) a continued emphasis on developing the productive capacity of poor-area&#13;
agriculture and rural enterprise through subsidized loans, (b) better targeting of assistance&#13;
to reach the poorest of the poor, and (c) improved management and coordination of&#13;
poverty reduction activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.12 The Government's poverty reduction strategy has been further defined and&#13;
substantially updated through the newly issued National Seven-Year (1994-2000) Plan&#13;
for Poverty Reduction (8-7 Plan). The 8-7 Plan recognizes that the significant reduction&#13;
and change in nature of absolute poverty (para. 1.1) makes it more practical and fiscally&#13;
less burdensome to target increased development and social services assistance to China's&#13;
remaining absolute poor. In near complete agreement with Strategies' recommendations&#13;
for reducing poverty in the 1990s, the 8-7 Plan calls for:&#13;
(a)   institution building and policy reform, including a strengthening of the&#13;
institutions responsible for implementing explicit poverty reduction projects&#13;
and programs, the establishment of an independent and objective poverty&#13;
monitoring system, the concentration of available funding in the poorest&#13;
counties (a number of relatively well-off counties and provinces have been&#13;
"graduated" from the new poverty reduction program), and improved access&#13;
of the poor to employment opportunities outside the poor areas;&#13;
(b)   greater investment in the development of human capital, including more&#13;
central government funding for health, education, and relief services in the&#13;
poorest areas; and,&#13;
(c)   continued investment in poor-area agricultural, rural enterprise, road and&#13;
other rural infrastructure development projects.&#13;
1.13  Officially Designated Poor Counties. In 1986, using Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
(MOA) county-level rural income data, LGPR developed a national roster of 331 poor&#13;
counties eligible for development assistance. A county was identified as poor if its 1985&#13;
average rural per capita income fell below poverty lines of Y 300, Y 200, or Y 150,&#13;
depending on other locational or political factors. Average per capita grain production of&#13;
less than 200 kg was also adopted as a second key indicator of poverty. In addition to the&#13;
national roster, 368 provincially designated poor counties, eligible for provincial funding,&#13;
were selected on the basis of poverty lines determined by the provinces. Province-&#13;
specific poverty lines used during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period ranged from Y 150&#13;
in Yunnan to Y 400 in Jiangsu. In addition to drawing up a roster of poor counties, most&#13;
provinces have identified townships in otherwise well-off counties as eligible for special&#13;
assistance. As evidenced by the wide difference in qualifying income levels (Y 150 to&#13;
Y 400), the provincial rosters include a number of counties that are relatively poor by&#13;
provincial standards but that would not qualify as absolutely poor by the national&#13;
minimum standard. That provinces created their own special programs testifies to a&#13;
concern with relative poverty and, in many instances, to provincial budgetary strength.&#13;
On the other hand, the provincial roster does, in some cases, compensate for the incorrect&#13;
exclusion of counties with average per capita income levels below the national minimum&#13;
standard. The Yunnan provincial roster, for example, includes all the counties that should&#13;
have received central government support for absolute poverty reduction (that is, 15&#13;
counties with average per capita income of between Y 120 and Y 150 in 1985).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
1.14  While a very large proportion of the rural population within the officially&#13;
designated poor counties must have been poor, this definition of poverty failed to capture&#13;
the poor in otherwise well-off counties.3 Based solely on 1985 income data, furthermore,&#13;
the method did not adequately correct for single-year aberrations in county rural income&#13;
levels. Strategies also observed that the regionalization of poverty evidenced by the&#13;
MOA county-level rural income data is significantly different from that indicated by the&#13;
State Statistical Bureau's (SSB) provincial rural income distribution data.&#13;
Notwithstanding these important issues, it is certain that the combined list of officially&#13;
designated poor counties captures at least half of the most severe remaining absolute&#13;
poverty in China. Furthermore, under the new 8-7 Plan, the list of officially designated&#13;
poor counties has been reduced from 699 to 592, and a number of relatively well-off&#13;
counties and provinces have "graduated" from the new poverty reduction program (para.&#13;
1.12).&#13;
D. ORIGIN OF THE PROJECT&#13;
1.15   Through the preparation of Strategies and its public release at the "International&#13;
Conference on Poverty Issues in China" (held in Beijing in October 1992), close&#13;
collaboration with the Chinese Government has been established and the Bank Group has&#13;
played an active role in the development of the new national strategy for reducing&#13;
absolute poverty in the 1990s (para. 1.12). At the conclusion of the conference, State&#13;
Councilor Chen Junsheng (the Government of China's senior policymaker for agriculture,&#13;
rural development, and poverty reduction) and senior Bank Group staff announced a&#13;
proposal to operationalize Strategies' recommendations for reducing poverty in the 1990s&#13;
through the Bank Group-assisted Southwest Poverty Reduction Project (SWPRP).&#13;
Consistent with SWPRP, the proposed Qinba Mountains Poverty Reduction Project&#13;
(QBPRP) would take a multisectoral approach to reducing absolute poverty in the worst-&#13;
affected upland counties of the Qinba mountains and Loess Plateau areas of Sichuan,&#13;
Shaanxi and Ningxia. Both projects strongly encourage community participation during&#13;
preparation and implementation. Supported by two generous Japan: Policy and Human&#13;
Resources Development Fund grants, preparation of the two projects has included local&#13;
and international consultants and more than 10 missions to China since July 1993.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.16   The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy in that it directly&#13;
addresses two of the Bank's top operational priorities in China, namely poverty reduction&#13;
and environmental protection. Bank Group participation in the project will greatly assist&#13;
3 Based on three-year (1981-83) average township-level rural per capita income data, the Research Center&#13;
for Rural Development (RCRD) had earlier identified 50 million absolute poor residing in about 7,000&#13;
townships, situated in 225 counties in 11 mountainous regions. While a preferred means of monitoring&#13;
poverty, the RCRD township-level methodology was not an operationally viable mechanism for targeting&#13;
China's poverty reduction programs. In 1986, LGPR switched to the county level for the purposes of&#13;
poverty reduction programs and monitoring.&#13;

the realization of the Government's 8-7 Plan and it is expected that, if successful, the&#13;
project will further highlight the potential of the multisectoral approach to the remainder&#13;
of China's poor areas and the overall poverty reduction program.  Bank Group&#13;
involvement in the project will also play a catalytic function in the establishment of an&#13;
independent national-level poverty monitoring system.  In addition, Bank Group&#13;
participation is helping to focus the project's rural development component toward the&#13;
development and provision of an integrated package of environmentally sound and&#13;
farmer-determined technologies for more productive upland agriculture.&#13;
F. BANK GROUP SECTOR WORK AND LENDING OPERATIONS&#13;
1.17  During the early and mid-1980s, the first Country Economic Report and the&#13;
Gansu Provincial Study devoted much analysis to China's income distribution and the&#13;
physical well-being of the Chinese population and the poor.4 A number of Bank Group-&#13;
supported projects during these years, including the Gansu Provincial Development&#13;
Project (Loan 2812-CHA and Credit 1793-CHA) and the Northern Irrigation Project&#13;
(Credit 1885-CHA), directly helped reduce poverty by providing opportunities for&#13;
voluntary resettlement to newly irrigated areas for hundreds of thousands of absolute poor&#13;
residing in rainfed upland areas of the Loess Plateau. The Gansu Provincial Development&#13;
Project also included a very effective rural education subproject that targeted the absolute&#13;
poor. More generally, the Bank Group's program of agricultural investments (about 40&#13;
projects in all), buttressed by projects supporting agricultural education, rural health care&#13;
and rural water supply, played a significant role in raising rural incomes and living&#13;
standards during the 1980s.&#13;
1.18  Completion of Strategies contributed to making poverty reduction a more explicit&#13;
focus of Bank Group lending in China in the early 1 990s. Bank Group-supported poverty&#13;
reduction activities, channeled to areas of concentrated poverty in central and western&#13;
China, now include poor-area health, education, rural water supply and hygiene, and&#13;
numerous agricultural projects and agricultural project subcomponents. The Rural Health&#13;
Workers Development Project (Credit 2539-CHA) aims at better-quality health services,&#13;
improved health status, and the development of new financing models for health services&#13;
in the poorest areas. The Comprehensive Maternal and Child Health Project (Credit&#13;
2655-CHA) addresses the malnutrition, epidemic disease and high maternal and infant&#13;
mortality rates that remain widespread among China's absolute poor. The Infectious&#13;
Diseases Project (Credit 2317-CHA) seeks to reduce the incidence and risk of infection of&#13;
two severe diseases (tuberculosis and schistosomiasis) that are most prevalent in poor&#13;
areas. The Disease Prevention Project (Credit 2794-CHA) will provide immunization&#13;
coverage and greater accessibility to health care in 10 poor provinces. The Education&#13;
Development in Poor Provinces (Credit 2339-CHA), Basic Education in Poor and&#13;
Minority Areas (Credit 2651-CHA), and Third Basic Education (Credit 2831-CHA)&#13;

and China: Growth and Development in Gansu Province (Washington, DC: The World Bank, 1988).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
projects are helping to improve primary and lower secondary education and schools in a&#13;
large number of poor counties and villages. By increasing coverage of safe water supply&#13;
and sanitation, health and hygiene services, the Rural Water and Sanitation Project&#13;
(Credit 2336-CHA) improves health and productivity of some of the poorest and most&#13;
needy inhabitants of rural China. The Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(Credit 2616-CHA) seeks to double real income levels for the 1.2 million rural poor in&#13;
the targeted watersheds by increasing agricultural productivity. The Gansu Hexi Corridor&#13;
Project (Loan 4028-CHA and Credit 2870-CHA) will reduce poverty by providing&#13;
opportunities for voluntary resettlement to newly irrigated lands for about 200,000 upland&#13;
poor in Gansu. The Shanxi Poverty Alleviation Project (Credit 2834-CHA) will raise&#13;
incomes for about 3 million poor through rehabilitation of an existing irrigation system,&#13;
terrace agriculture, smallholder livestock, and other activities. The Shaanxi Agricultural&#13;
Development (Credit 1997-CHA), Henan Agricultural Development (Credit 2242-CHA),&#13;
Tarim Basin (Credit 2294), Guangdong Agricultural Development (Credit 2307-CHA)&#13;
and Sichuan Agricultural Development (Credit 241 1-CHA) projects include poverty&#13;
reduction subprojects in several extremely poor counties. Attacking poverty through&#13;
single-sector programs, these projects and project components have made a real and&#13;
sustainable contribution to poverty reduction. SWPRP (Loan 3906-CHA and Credit&#13;
2744-CHA) is the first Bank Group-supported project in China to use a focused,&#13;
multisectoral rural development approach to attack absolute poverty in a severely&#13;
resource-deficient area where single-sector programs cannot achieve sustained poverty&#13;
reduction.&#13;
G. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREvIOuS BANK GROUP OPERATIONS&#13;
1.19 The Bank Group's experience with a large number of multisectoral rural-&#13;
development-cum-poverty-reduction projects has not been entirely successful in terms of&#13;
impact or sustainability. An extensive Operations Evaluation Department (OED) review&#13;
of two decades of Bank Group experience with rural development projects documents&#13;
that the complexity of project design and implementation and problems with institutional&#13;
coordination have been the principal causes of mixed results.5 This confirms the warning&#13;
of the Bank Group's 1975 Rural Development Sector Policy Paper that such projects tend&#13;
to suffer from a program design that is too ambitious and complex, calling for exceptional&#13;
leadership that cannot always be made available on a sustained basis. Recognizing that&#13;
these institutional difficulties are inherent to multisectoral projects, the OED analysis&#13;
favors the approach of "implementing separate project components in different ministries&#13;
as though they were separate projects, but with a coordinating unit located in a nonsector&#13;
ministry such as Planning or the President's Office" and emphasizes the importance of&#13;
long-term institution building. The OED report also highlights the importance of&#13;
(a) strong government commitment to the project and a favorable macroeconomic&#13;
environment, (b) relying primarily on locally proven technical innovations (the results of&#13;
research and trials were often not available in time to have an impact on concurrent&#13;
5 World Bank Experience with Rural Development, 1965-1986 (The World Bank, 1987).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
projects), (c) retaining flexibility in program design during implementation (i.e., after the&#13;
time of appraisal), and (d) supplementing the Bank Group's own inputs, during design&#13;
and supervision, to cover the full range of skills required by a multisectoral project. A&#13;
more recent OED review of the Aga Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP), on the other&#13;
hand, concludes that "rural development can be made to work" with proper project design&#13;
and implementation.6 Additional key lessons from the successful AKRSP experience are&#13;
the importance of (e) a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation process and (f) full&#13;
community participation.&#13;
1.20 The OED analysis of the Bank Group's rural development projects confirms that&#13;
the proposed project's two principal issues are its above-average complexity and its&#13;
requirement for above-average institutional capacity for project design and&#13;
implementation. Project design and plans for organization and management directly&#13;
address these two concerns. First, although the proposed project comprises a number of&#13;
diverse sectors, the project activities within each of these sectors together represent an&#13;
integrated package of proven technologies. Second, as recommended by the OED report,&#13;
the project will not be implemented by a sectoral agency. Instead, LGPR, which is a&#13;
nonsectoral office of the State Council, is responsible for coordinating project design and,&#13;
through the provincial and county Project Management Offices (PMO) and Leading&#13;
Groups (LG), for monitoring implementation. Per OED's recommendation, each&#13;
component has been designed at each operational level by the relevant specialized&#13;
sectoral agency as a "separate project." LGPR's Foreign Capital Project Management&#13;
Center (FCPMC) was established, with bureau-level status, for the preparation and&#13;
implementation of SWPRP. FCPMC is now staffed at levels sufficient for satisfactory&#13;
implementation of SWPRP and the preparation of the proposed Qinba Mountains Poverty&#13;
Reduction Project. In addition, the project enjoys strong government support and a&#13;
favorable macroeconomic environment, relies primarily on an integrated package of&#13;
proven technologies, and would establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation&#13;
process. It is believed that current Bank Group procedures provide adequate allowance&#13;
for changes to project design during the course of implementation. Lastly, the project&#13;
encourages community participation by enabling households to make key decisions&#13;
during project design and implementation.&#13;
1.21  The proposed project also builds on lessons from recent Bank Group loans to&#13;
China in the health, education, agriculture and rural infrastructure sectors. For social&#13;
services, specific lessons include the importance of increasing access to existing rural&#13;
facilities, improving teacher and health service worker technical skills, establishing&#13;
reliable financing mechanisms, and upgrading bilingual education in minority areas. In&#13;
agriculture, the experience of earlier Bank Group-supported projects suggests the need for&#13;
greater emphasis on crop diversification and marketing in order to avoid the risk of&#13;
oversupply, and to enhance sustainability by assigning responsibility for project&#13;
management to existing institutions (suitably strengthened). Since the Bank Group has&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
very little experience with labor mobility projects, the project builds on the early&#13;
experience of SWPRP's labor mobility component, and on lessons from the Ministry of&#13;
Labor's (MOL) recent experience in this area and ongoing rural research work.&#13;
1.22 SWPRP Poverty Reduction Model. SWPRP has been under implementation for&#13;
two years and, while careful review and evaluation of the project's individual&#13;
components can only begin in the latter years of project implementation, enough evidence&#13;
is already available to support some preliminary lessons.  First, the successful&#13;
implementation of SWPRP during 1995-96 has confirmed that the project's unique&#13;
organizational and management structure can satisfy its above-average complexity and&#13;
implementation capacity requirements. Second, the SWPRP model of poverty reduction&#13;
represents a significant advance over previous poverty reduction mechanisms in China&#13;
and is worthy of widespread adoption. Third, it is now clear which components have&#13;
been most successful. During intensive supervision work during the second half of 1996,&#13;
an organized exchange between SWPRP county PMO staff in Guangxi confirmed the&#13;
growing consensus that:  the education and health subcomponents and the rural&#13;
infrastructure component are the activities that are most warmly received by the project's&#13;
primary beneficiaries; the labor mobility component provides the quickest means of&#13;
overcoming poverty; the agriculture component's activities require an enormous amount&#13;
of preparatory work by county- and lower-level project staff; and project supervision and&#13;
poverty monitoring are the most difficult tasks to complete.  The success of the&#13;
education, health and rural infrastructure activities is closely associated with the fact that&#13;
project villagers actively plan and implement, and directly and immediately benefit from,&#13;
these undertakings. Bank Group supervision of the project has confirmed the county&#13;
PMO staffs views that the project's primary beneficiaries are extremely enthusiastic&#13;
about the education, health, drinking water, and other rural infrastructure activities, and&#13;
that labor mobility can quickly lift migrant workers and (through remittances) their&#13;
families above the poverty line. Supervision missions have also observed the payoff to&#13;
some successful upland agriculture activities and to effective project supervision and&#13;
poverty monitoring, but have noted the heavy demands these activities place on county-&#13;
and lower-level project implementation staff. TVE development is the only SWPRP&#13;
component that is performing poorly. Measures were taken during the second half of&#13;
1996 to overcome the key obstacles of (a) poor prospects for enterprise financial viability&#13;
and (b) lack of counterpart financing, and it is hoped that the component will move&#13;
forward quickly during 1997.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. NATURAL RESOURCES, LAND USE AND POVERTY&#13;
2.1   Location and Population. The project would take place in 26 mountainous and&#13;
remote poor counties of Sichuan (12 counties), Shaanxi (10 counties) and Ningxia (4&#13;
counties), all of which are nationally designated poor counties under the 8-7 Plan (para.&#13;
1.14). The project area comprises two distinct regions: 22 counties in northeast Sichuan&#13;
and southern Shaanxi, stretching east-to-west over 350 km along the Qinling and Daba&#13;
mountain ranges; and four counties in southern Ningxia in the Loess Plateau. Project&#13;
locations and area statistics are given in IBRD Map No. 27815 and Annex 1. Within the&#13;
26 project counties, the project area comprises the poorest 2,941 administrative villages (or&#13;
about a quarter of the total number of administrative villages in the project counties) with a&#13;
total rural population of 2.3 million people. The Sichuan and Shaanxi project area has 2.08&#13;
million beneficiaries, of which less than 1 percent are ethnic minorities. The Ningxia&#13;
project area has about 0.24 million people, nearly 80 percent of whom are Hui people,&#13;
distinguished from Hans chiefly by their religion (Islam). The Hui comprise 7 percent of&#13;
the total nurnber of project beneficiaries.&#13;
2.2   Topography, Soils and Climate. The mountainous part of the Sichuan and&#13;
Shaanxi project area lies within 500 to 2,950 meters of elevation. It is deeply dissected&#13;
into narrow, steep-sided valleys, with many rock outcrops and shallow soils that originate&#13;
from parent materials ranging from limestone to granite. Arable land comprises less than&#13;
10 percent of the total land area. The seven southern counties of the Sichuan project area&#13;
comprise hilly terrain, at elevations ranging from 200 to 600 meters, with purple soils&#13;
developed on sandstone parent material. In both the mountainous and hilly project areas,&#13;
soil fertility is generally low, with limited organic matter, phosphorus and potassium.&#13;
The climate is subtropical with warm, moist summers, and cold winters with low rainfall.&#13;
Spring and autumn droughts are common, while high-intensity summer rainfall often&#13;
causes flooding and waterlogging of soils. All result in unstable yields and severe crop&#13;
losses on nonterraced land. The number of frost-free days declines from 280 in the&#13;
Sichuan hills, to 220 in Shaanxi valleys, to only 170 days at elevations of 1,200 meters&#13;
and above. Households residing above 1,200 meters of elevation comprise a limited&#13;
portion of the project beneficiaries in Sichuan, but account for at least 30 percent of&#13;
project beneficiaries in Shaanxi.&#13;
2.3   The Ningxia project area lies within 1,500 to 2,950 meters of elevation and&#13;
contains a mix of landforms, including loess-mantled granitic hills and mountains in the&#13;
southern Liupan mountains, steep and heavily gullied loess hills in the central part of the&#13;
project area, and loess hills and sandy rolling terrain with dunes in the northern part.&#13;
Soils are mainly derived from loess, and have moderate fertility with thin eroded topsoil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Mean annual rainfall decreases from south to north from 650 to 250 millimeters (mm),&#13;
while annual evaporation increases from 1,200 to 2,300 mm. The climate becomes&#13;
semiarid in the lower-elevation northern project area, and in valleys throughout the&#13;
project area. Drinking water is severely constrained in these areas, and has to be stored&#13;
throughout the winter season. Moisture deficits for rainfed crops occur everywhere in the&#13;
project area. Moreover, spring drought-such as in 1992 and 1995-causes failure of the&#13;
wheat crop (the area's staple food). The frost-free period is only 130 to 180 days.&#13;
2.4   Land Use and Farming Systems. Current farming systems in all the project&#13;
villages strive to achieve basic food security and minimize income shocks through the&#13;
close integration of field crops (both subsistence and cash), animal husbandry and tree&#13;
crops. In Sichuan and Shaanxi, land use is dominated by forestry. In the mountainous&#13;
area, some 60 percent of the land area is covered by oak and coniferous forests.&#13;
However, with population densities of 400 inhabitants per square kilometer (krn2) in the&#13;
hills and 100 inhabitants per km2 in the mountains, such forestry can only provide a&#13;
limited source of income. Arable land per capita ranges from only 0.06 hectares (ha) in&#13;
Sichuan to 0.12 ha in Shaanxi. Application of cash inputs is very limited, and although&#13;
one third of existing arable land is terraced, average yields for the principal crops of corn&#13;
and wheat are only 1.5 to 2.5 tons per ha. Corn cultivation (on bush-fallowed hillsides)&#13;
has severely encroached upon the forest area in the mountains. A variety of relay-&#13;
cropping patterns-which include corn, wheat, potato, sweet potato, pulses, rice and&#13;
rapeseed-are employed on the arable land to increase production and reduce the impact&#13;
of climatic risks. The arable land area is also extensively interplanted with tree crops,&#13;
including mulberry (for silk production), tung and citrus at lower elevations, and nuts,&#13;
lacquer, paulownia, and tea at higher elevations. Most households raise pigs, which are&#13;
fed on local grasses, tuber crops, and bran. Pigs are the major source of cash income.&#13;
Fewer than half of project households raise a cow (used primarily for draft purposes). At&#13;
lower elevations, secondary sources of cash income include silk cocoons, edible fungi,&#13;
and occasional sales of cows, poultry, vegetables, fruit and nuts. At higher elevations, the&#13;
gathering of wild medicinal plants provides a limited source of cash income.&#13;
Commercial cattle and goat raising is being developed, using palatable shrubs and native&#13;
grasses as grazing resources.&#13;
2.5   In the Ningxia project area, livestock is the primary source of cash income for&#13;
farmers, with products including meat, leather and wool. Livestock sales are also the&#13;
primary means of buffering grain crop failures. Rangeland in much of the project area is&#13;
extensively grazed by herds of sheep, goat and cattle. Straw and alfalfa are also&#13;
important fodder sources. The long cold season and the variability of straw output cause&#13;
severe feed deficits during winter, and there is a consequent deterioration of animal health&#13;
and survival rates. With growing animal numbers, and a decreasing rangeland area due to&#13;
the extension of wheat, rangeland overgrazing has become common at lower elevations&#13;
and adds to fodder shortages. The cropping pattern is predominantly rainfed, and&#13;
includes mostly spring crops of wheat (rotated with peas) or summer crops of potatoes,&#13;
linseed, oats, millet and buckwheat. Until recently, corn has been only a minor crop in&#13;
the project villages. Arable land holdings average 0.6 ha per capita, but yields are limited&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
and highly variable. Wheat only yields an average 0.6 ton/ha. Terracing has created&#13;
distinctly higher fertility in areas with annual rainfall above 400 mm. Trees are hardly&#13;
present in the land use system. Despite previous plantation programs of fuelwood&#13;
bushes, there is a continued shortage of fuelwood. Available straw is also often used for&#13;
fuel, contributing to the shortage of animal feed. Fruit production is being developed on&#13;
a very limited basis.&#13;
2.6   Resource Constraints and Poverty. Topography, soil, and climate all pose&#13;
serious limitations to agricultural development in the project areas. Population densities,&#13;
which are well in excess of the carrying capacity of the agricultural resource base, are a&#13;
major factor in the ongoing environmental degradation. In the Sichuan and Shaanxi&#13;
project area, highly variable grain yields and cash crop production on unterraced land are&#13;
the major agricultural constraints faced by households. Households residing above 1,200&#13;
meters of elevation have limited options to improve food crop production. In addition,&#13;
settlements are scattered and remote from roads, and the majority of households&#13;
consequently have very limited access to markets, agricultural extension and other&#13;
services. The Ningxia project area faces a complex set of resource limitations. Water&#13;
resources are inadequate and unreliable for both crop production and human and animal&#13;
consumption. Insufficient biomass production results in fuel and feed deficits. Animal&#13;
numbers are too low to allow households to withstand drought years, but too high for the&#13;
declining rangeland resource.&#13;
2.7   These severe resource constraints in the Qinba project area are associated with&#13;
levels of grain production that are both below basic subsistence requirements and highly&#13;
variable, very limited cash income, and extreme poverty. In the Sichuan and Shaanxi&#13;
project area, annual per capita grain production during 1993-95 averaged about 300&#13;
kilograms (kg). Average annual per capita income during 1993-95 was about Y 525 (in&#13;
1995 prices), or just one third of national average rural per capita income. The resource&#13;
constraints and consequent poverty are most extreme in the Ningxia project area, where&#13;
annual per capita grain production averaged only 150 kg during 1993-95, and annual per&#13;
capita income averaged Y 470 (in 1995 prices) during 1993-95. Most of the project villages&#13;
suffer significant grain deficits, and on average between 10 to 70 kg per capita of relief&#13;
grain are brought into project counties annually. Even these quantities of relief grain are not&#13;
sufficient to raise per capita grain availability to the level necessary for basic subsistence,&#13;
and food shortages and malnutrition are common, particularly during the end of winter and&#13;
early spring. Since much of household income is in-kind and consumed on-farm, entire&#13;
households typically have cash incomes of only Y 150 to Y 300 ($15 to $35) per year.&#13;
Some farm households also obtain irregular off-farm income from activities such as local&#13;
mining, construction, and migrant labor in urban areas. Households with very limited land&#13;
area, with a high proportion of dependents, few livestock, or adversely affected by natural&#13;
disaster have significantly lower grain production and incomes than the average figures&#13;
given above.&#13;
2.8   Development Strategies. Despite these resource constraints, there are opportunities&#13;
to increase agricultural productivity and income through synergistic investments in fully&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
integrated farming systems. Most importantly, investments in land development (such as&#13;
terracing) and water resource development (such as microirrigation systems) will directly&#13;
boost production of grain and cash crops, and will also provide additional crop residues for&#13;
the expansion of livestock production and cash income for the purchase of fertilizer, better&#13;
seed, and other yield-increasing inputs. Expanded animal production augments cash&#13;
incomes over the short term, and provides more organic fertilizer for field crop production.&#13;
Over the longer term, expanded tree crop production and fodder resource development will&#13;
help to reduce upland environmental destruction, augment cash income, and provide feed&#13;
for expanded animal production and fuelwood for household cooking and heating. The&#13;
effectiveness of all of these investments should be augmented through increased and&#13;
improved support services at the village level-including training and extension, and&#13;
veterinary services-undertaken on the basis of full community participation. While no one&#13;
of these investment activities would lead to a major sustained increase in farm productivity&#13;
and incomes, together they should be sufficient to achieve a significant sustainable impact.&#13;
And while investments in upland agriculture alone cannot bring most of Qinba's poor above&#13;
the poverty line, together they comprise a key component of the package of multisectoral&#13;
investments that can lead to a sustainable reduction in absolute poverty.&#13;
2.9  In the Sichuan and Shaanxi project area, an appropriate integrated strategy would&#13;
be to help households enhance their land use systems through investments in terracing,&#13;
animal husbandry, and tree crops. Terraces nearby farmers' homes, which support grain&#13;
and cash crops, feed production, interplanted trees, and pig and poultry production, would&#13;
be expanded. Together with appropriate technology (such as basic tools and better&#13;
seeds), terracing would allow a sustained increase in soil fertility, and increased and more&#13;
stable crop yields. As a result, bush-fallow cultivation on steeper hill and mountainside&#13;
slopes would decline, allowing the development of tree crops and animal grazing on these&#13;
lands.  Households would not only undertake tree crop plantations on their own&#13;
wasteland area, which is limited and often less fertile, but also on contracted government-&#13;
managed forestry land. Substantial investments in tree crop development-which would&#13;
include provision of improved fruit and economic tree variety root stock, and soil&#13;
improvement, and be supported by tree crop management technical advice-would balance&#13;
households' short- and long-term benefits. Related marketing risks and long-term&#13;
technical risks would be minimized through the provision of appropriate technology,&#13;
farmer training, and improved market access.&#13;
2.10  In the loess hills project area, the strategy would emphasize increasing biomass&#13;
production.  The development of water-harvesting microirrigation systems and the&#13;
expansion of terraces would allow a gradual shift from wheat to crops with increased&#13;
biomass output, such as potatoes and corn, on part of the arable land. Increased biomass&#13;
would contribute to the reduction of animal losses during droughts and during winter and&#13;
early spring, and also help reduce households' cooking and heating fuel deficit. A&#13;
comprehensive improvement of feed resources, including corn and alfalfa, and the use of&#13;
rotational grazing and other improved rangeland management practices, would further&#13;
contribute to the resolution of existing feed deficits. The Ningxia government has&#13;
established and already initiated plans for these core investments in upland agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
These plans call for a massive buildup of water-harvesting and microirrigation systems,&#13;
terracing, afforestation, and fodder resource development. The effectiveness of these plans&#13;
will be greatly enhanced through a large-scale poverty-reduction-through-voluntary-&#13;
resettlement program, which will provide one third of the population of the project upland&#13;
counties with the opportunity to relocate to lower-elevation newly irrigated areas. These&#13;
government programs should be further complemented with support for soil improvement&#13;
on the newly terraced land, improved agricultural practices on lands serviced by new&#13;
microirrigation systems, and expanded animal production.&#13;
B. SOCIAL SERVICES&#13;
2.11   Education. In its 1995 " Education Law," the State Education Commission (SEdC)&#13;
established national implementation plans for achieving universal basic education (UBE) by&#13;
2000. Since local governments and communities are primarily responsible for financing&#13;
primary education, different targets and timetables have been determined for achieving&#13;
UBE in accordance with different regions' abilities and resources. Urban and better-off&#13;
rural areas, which comprise about 80 percent of the country's population, have already&#13;
achieved six-year UBE and expect to meet nine-year targets before or by 2000. Less&#13;
developed areas, on the other hand, have more modest UBE targets. The national plans&#13;
specify that, for the poorest 20 percent of China's population, 5 percent will achieve nine-&#13;
year UBE by 2000, another 10 percent will strive for five- or six-year UBE, and the&#13;
remaining 5 percent in poverty-stricken areas will seek three- to four-year UBE.&#13;
2.12   Despite impressive achievements at the national level, primary schooling in the&#13;
project areas is still marked by poor attendance and very low on-time graduation. Official&#13;
figures indicate a significant disparity between the national average and project county&#13;
average. For example, the net enrollment ratios (NER) for the nation and for the project&#13;
counties for the primary school-age cohort are 98 and 85 percent, respectively. Special&#13;
household surveys, undertaken during project preparation, document even greater&#13;
disparities at the project village level. For example, the special household surveys show&#13;
that the three representative villages in Zhenan County (Shaanxi) have an average NER of&#13;
79 percent and on-time graduation ratio (OGR)7 of 40 percent. The low OGR is mainly due&#13;
to the high dropout rate-an average of 35 percent for the three villages in 1995. Gender&#13;
disparity is even more severe at the project village level. The household surveys show that&#13;
girls comprise 60 percent of school dropouts and, consequently, that only 20 percent of the&#13;
15-year-old female cohort graduated from primary school. It is no surprise that many&#13;
adults, particularly women, do not achieve literacy.&#13;
2.13   Low educational status in the project areas is the result of the poor's limited access&#13;
to education and the inferior quality of primary education services in the poor areas. While&#13;
the central government provides financial transfers to the poor areas of China, these&#13;
7 OGR is the percentage of primary school graduates among the 15-year-old population. Higher&#13;
repetition and dropout rates usually result in a lower OGR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
resources are not adequate to meet all primary education needs, and financing of education&#13;
is mainly the responsibility of local governments and communities. As part of their cost-&#13;
recovery process, these local entities require that families pay for children to attend school.&#13;
The annual school fee per child, about Y 80 to Y 100, represents nearly 25 percent of&#13;
average per capita income in the project areas, and is therefore a major hindrance to many&#13;
poor children's access to school. Parents often have to pay additional boarding and&#13;
transportation for children in grades four and above, since these schools are usually located&#13;
far from home. This heavy financial burden is also often exacerbated by the perceived-&#13;
opportunity cost of forgone household labor, especially for girls. Limited government and&#13;
community financing has also contributed to a lack of primary schools, dilapidated school&#13;
buildings, and highly inadequate schooling materials such as books and instructional&#13;
equipment.&#13;
2.14 Along with limited access, inadequately planned and managed teacher training&#13;
programs, at both the preservice and inservice level, also hinder the quality of primary&#13;
education and the progress toward universalization in the project areas. Official statistics&#13;
show that, while 83 percent of primary school teachers meet the State-prescribed&#13;
qualifications at the national level, this percentage at the project county level ranges from&#13;
only 60 percent in Shaanxi to 74 percent in Sichuan. Current training courses focus on&#13;
content and pedagogical techniques appropriate for large urban schools, but few programs&#13;
offer teachers instructional methods and skills needed for the curriculum suited to small and&#13;
sometimes ethnically mixed rural schools. In addition, the lack of both management&#13;
personnel training and accurate education statistics and reporting has lowered the&#13;
effectiveness of education management.&#13;
2.15   Health. China has made considerable progress in enhancing the health of its&#13;
general population, but regional disparities in health status are in many cases extreme.&#13;
Infant mortality, maternal mortality, and nutritional status are far worse in project areas&#13;
compared to the national average and better-off rural areas (para. 1.4). The poor health&#13;
status of those in the project areas stems from a combination of limited access to health&#13;
services and the low quality of services provided.&#13;
2.16  In combination with inadequate government support and severe poverty, access to&#13;
health care in the project areas is hindered by the dilapidated condition and insufficient&#13;
number of health clinics, an inadequate quantity and flow of supplies and pharmaceuticals,&#13;
and the fee-for-service provision of most health services. Village health clinics exist in only&#13;
20 to 30 percent of project areas in Shaanxi and Ningxia. Village clinics do exist in 70&#13;
percent of the project areas in Sichuan, but nearly all are dilapidated. Most of the existing&#13;
village health clinics do not have an adequate operating budget for the pharmaceuticals,&#13;
syringes, needles, and sterilization equipment necessary to provide even basic health care.&#13;
Due to the lack of health facilities, most villagers in the project area must walk at least 4 km&#13;
to reach a village clinic or (in some cases) a township hospital. Following the elimination&#13;
of the cooperative health system during the 1980s, many rural families do not have health&#13;
insurance and must obtain care on a fee-for-service basis. The special household surveys&#13;
(para. 2.12) indicate that as many as 87 percent of the project population suffer from one or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
more of the following illnesses: acute respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, severe&#13;
colds, and neonatal tetanus, and annual treatments for such illnesses could cost a family as&#13;
much as Y 40. This amount is prohibitive for many poor families, and at present less than&#13;
20 percent of those suffering significant illness actually visit clinics.&#13;
2.17   The quality of the health services that reach the poor population greatly suffers&#13;
because of inadequate training on the part of providers, insufficient monetary incentives to&#13;
provide quality care, and poor planning and management. The care practices and skills of&#13;
health staff at all, but particularly at lower levels, is problematic. Compensation for health&#13;
workers is insufficient, resulting in low retention rates and in health workers splitting their&#13;
time between health tasks and other income-earning activities. (Since most project farm&#13;
families cannot afford to pay for clinical visits, village health workers rely on selling&#13;
pharmaceuticals-at an average retail markup of 30 percent-for much or all of their&#13;
income from practicing medicine.) Furthermore, reliable data on mortality, morbidity, and&#13;
nutritional status, which are important for designing and evaluating health and nutrition&#13;
interventions, are lacking.&#13;
C. RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
2.18 The Government's Food-for-Work Program (para. 1.9) was established in 1985 as a&#13;
means to improve basic infrastructure in rural China's poorest areas. The Program's&#13;
achievements have been significant, and by end-1995 a total of Y 19.8 billion in cash and&#13;
in-kind had been provided for the construction of rural water supply facilities, roads,&#13;
electrification, small-scale irrigation, drainage, soil conservation, terracing and other&#13;
infrastructure. However, despite these large expenditures, by end-1995 there were still&#13;
some 30 million inhabitants in the officially designated 592 poor counties without access to&#13;
potable water, some 214 townships without road access, and about 20,000 villages without&#13;
any form of electricity supply.&#13;
2.19   Despite the overall success of the Food-for-Work Program, environmental&#13;
degradation and the continuing lack of basic rural infrastructure in the poorest villages in&#13;
the project area make living conditions harsh and arduous. Inhabitants in these regions&#13;
often have to cover long distances by foot through steep terrain to reach the nearest source&#13;
of drinking water, and even there the water source may be contaminated or contain&#13;
dangerous levels of natural fluoride.  The expansion of water-saving techniques is&#13;
particularly urgent in the loess hills project counties where 83 percent of project villages&#13;
face seasonal drinking water shortages and only a very small proportion of project area&#13;
cultivated land is irrigated. Although paved roads reach all project county seats and dirt&#13;
roads reach almost all project townships in the project area, more than half of the&#13;
administrative villages in the Sichuan and Shaanxi project area, and about one third of the&#13;
project administrative villages in Ningxia, have no road access.  For most project&#13;
beneficiaries, the nearest dirt roads are reached only after some kilometers of steep climb&#13;
and descent over dirt foot trail, and considerable labor power is expended by villagers in&#13;
bringing their small amounts of agricultural and forest products to the nearest farners'&#13;
market. Half of the project administrative villages in Sichuan, and about one third of those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
in Shaanxi have no access to electricity. Overall, the limited access to safe water supply,&#13;
roads, electricity and telecommunications constitutes a severe constraint to the increased&#13;
productivity and improved health and well-being of the poorest communities in these&#13;
remote areas.&#13;
D. EMPLOYMENT, TVE DEVELOPMENT, AND MICROFINANCE&#13;
2.20 Labor Markets. Rural underemployment is a major challenge for the Chinese&#13;
Government, and agricultural job creation, which is expected to increase only marginally in&#13;
the 1990s (less than 1 percent per year at best), cannot solve the problem. For much of rural&#13;
China, the tremendous growth of employment opportunities in TVEs, coupled with large-&#13;
scale migration to emerging job opportunities in rural and urban areas, has provided a&#13;
solution to this underemployment. However, in the upland counties of Sichuan, Shaanxi,&#13;
Ningxia, and other western provinces, TVE development has been relatively slow, and&#13;
access to off-farm employment opportunities has been very limited. There are large pools&#13;
of surplus laborers in the western provinces, and more than one third of the rural population&#13;
in the project areas are chronically underemployed (i.e., classified as "surplus workers"). A&#13;
profile of the underemployed in project areas has identified a large pool of potentially&#13;
productive workers, provided they are offered rudimentary training. At least half of these&#13;
underemployed are illiterate or have only completed primary school education, and three&#13;
quarters are between the ages of 16 to 35.&#13;
2.21  TVE Development. The TVE sector has been one of the most dynamic elements of&#13;
the economic boom in China over the past 15 years. Nationally, TVE gross output value&#13;
amounted to Y 6.9 trillion in 1995, corresponding to a real increase of more than fourfold&#13;
since 1990. TVEs are a promising source of employment for the rural underemployed,&#13;
providing jobs to more than 129 million workers, or some 29 percent of the national rural&#13;
labor force, in 1995.&#13;
2.22 Measured by gross revenue, TVE development in China's western region has kept&#13;
pace with the national average during the 1990s. The growth of gross revenue of Sichuan's&#13;
TVEs has outpaced the national average during the 1990s. Measured by employment&#13;
growth rates, TVE development in China's western region has outstripped that of the nation&#13;
as a whole since 1990. Average annual TVE employment growth in Sichuan and Ningxia&#13;
was particularly strong during 1990-95, reaching 10.3 and 16.3 percent, respectively.&#13;
Shaanxi, at 5.3 percent, lagged the national average of 6.8 percent.&#13;
2.23  Unfortunately, TVE development has been relatively weak in the poor upland&#13;
project areas where significant barriers block the development of agroprocessing, mineral&#13;
processing, handicraft and other industries. Project county TVE and Labor Bureau staff&#13;
attribute slow TVE development to the lack of investment credit and working capital and&#13;
poorly developed infrastructure. While TVE managers may be attracted by relatively low&#13;
wage costs and the availability of agricultural and mineral raw materials, these advantages&#13;
are often not sufficient to overcome the lack of financing, roads, reliable electricity supply&#13;
and other basic requirements. Despite these obstacles and previous experience of slow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
development, the production and employment potential of selected enterprises in poor&#13;
counties should not be overlooked. The Zhenan County Nasha Embroidery Station in&#13;
Shaanxi is a good example. For the past 10 years, the Station has established marketing&#13;
channels with more developed provinces and now subcontracts embroidery orders to more&#13;
than 500 upland village women. These women, who first receive training by Station staff,&#13;
complete these work orders at home. Village women earn an average income of about&#13;
Y 300 per month from this activity, which alone is often sufficient to bring their entire&#13;
family above the absolute poverty line. The Station has large numbers of orders for their&#13;
products, but has been unable to fully satisfy demand and expand its business due to&#13;
insufficient investment credit and working capital. Other TVEs throughout the project area,&#13;
such as carpet weaving and silk reeling factories, have significant job creation potential but&#13;
remain underfunded.&#13;
2.24  The Government's "East-West Cooperation Program" was recently established as&#13;
a means of expediting rural enterprise development in western China by linking poor&#13;
counties with existing firms in China's coastal and other more developed regions. A&#13;
strategic alliance between poor counties and China's more developed areas offers the&#13;
possibility of more effectively matching the poor areas' surplus labor and often abundant&#13;
supplies of raw materials with more developed areas' advanced technology, better&#13;
management skills, greater market access, and available investment funds.&#13;
2.25  Labor Mobility. Local TVEs cannot create sufficient numbers of jobs for the large&#13;
number of rural surplus laborers in upland counties, and many unemployed people turn to&#13;
labor mobility as an alternative. However, poor households in upland counties suffer from&#13;
serious labor market barriers, which raise the risks of labor mobility and lower the returns.&#13;
Faced with limited local employment opportunities and little information about jobs in&#13;
distant markets, tens of thousands of surplus laborers from upland households use informal&#13;
labor mobility channels to find work. Households report having to liquidate assets or take&#13;
on additional debt from local sources to finance frequently unsuccessful job searches.&#13;
While Sichuan is recognized as China's leader in labor mobility, having developed a large&#13;
network of informal employment connections, the very poor in the project areas rarely get&#13;
employment opportunities from these networks.&#13;
2.26  Both government-organized and spontaneous labor mobility channels now exist.&#13;
However, existing government-organized channels have not focused on helping the millions&#13;
of underemployed poor upland migrants eager to find jobs in urban markets. (Until&#13;
recently, the priority of provincial Labor Bureaus has instead been the redeployment of&#13;
unemployed workers from urban state-owned enterprises.) Consequently, most rural&#13;
migrant laborers-and nearly all poor-area migrant laborers-use the riskier spontaneous&#13;
labor mobility channels. In Sichuan, for example, between 8 and 9 million people have&#13;
migrated to other provinces over the last decade in search of jobs. Government channels&#13;
facilitated the flow of about 2 million of these migrant laborers, but very few if any of these&#13;
were from the poorest and more remote Qinba mountains area. In Shaanxi, an estimated 1.5&#13;
million people migrated interprovincially to find jobs, with only 175,000 served by Labor&#13;
Bureau channels and another 74,000 using other employment agencies. Most of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
spontaneous labor migrants headed for Guangdong, Shanghai, Beijing, Hainan and&#13;
Xinjiang.&#13;
2.27  One reason for large-scale spontaneous labor mobility is that wage rate differences&#13;
between poor rural areas and prosperous urban and rural areas have grown, from a 300&#13;
percent difference in 1982 to about 600 percent at present. The large wage rate gap holds&#13;
the promise of large remittances as a source of cash income for upland poor households and&#13;
the local economy. MOL estimates that 37 million rural migrants in 23 large cities remitted&#13;
Y 75 billion to their farnilies in 1994, and the Sichuan Labor Bureau reports that that&#13;
province's six million migrant workers send home remittances of more than Y 16 billion&#13;
each year. Per capita remittances of Y 2,000 are far greater than per capita income for poor&#13;
households in upland counties (viz., Y 530 or less in 1995), and would alone be more than&#13;
sufficient to achieve the 8-7 Plan target for per capita income (of Y 500 in 1992 constant&#13;
yuan) for such families. Village interviews have revealed that, even without remittances&#13;
from migrants, the upland household benefits significantly from just the decreased demand&#13;
on its meager food supply.&#13;
2.28  The potential gains from labor mobility hide significant risks, which present special&#13;
challenges to certain groups of migrants from the project areas (such as women and poorly&#13;
educated migrants). Rural workers migrating through spontaneous channels often work in&#13;
coal mines, construction sites and assembly lines, and are increasingly vulnerable to illness,&#13;
accidents, sexual abuse, wages below legal minimums, and other forms of exploitation.&#13;
Accident rates, arbitrary payroll deductions and labor disputes are more likely, since&#13;
workers do not have the proper documentation and are poorly informed about their legal&#13;
rights. Growing urban labor markets in the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas do need large&#13;
numbers of low-skilled labor for new and expanding plants, but the presence of millions of&#13;
migrants also increases the already severe strains on urban housing, water, sewer,&#13;
communications, transportation and other services in these areas. While they recognize the&#13;
economic benefits of migrant workers, municipal authorities in many cities are concerned&#13;
with the risk of large and expanding slums in urban and periurban areas.&#13;
2.29  Microfmance. Despite the restructuring of the financial sector in the early 1990s,&#13;
China's mainstream rural financial institutions remain completely state-owned and offer a&#13;
narrow range of basic financial services to state agencies for mandatory crop programs,&#13;
rural collectives, and state-owned enterprises. Rural credit cooperatives collect savings, but&#13;
do not provide a significant amount of working capital, investment credit or consumption&#13;
loans. Informal financial arrangements are growing rapidly, but they remain expensive,&#13;
localized, and seasonally limited. Generally, due to their lack of collateral, low literacy, and&#13;
physical isolation, very poor households cannot obtain loans from formal providers.&#13;
Informal providers do offer loans to poor households, but at very high cost. In practical&#13;
terms, two elements of rural finance stand out: (a) the formal financial sector does not have&#13;
sustainable institutions serving rural areas, and (b) most rural low-income households and&#13;
microenterprises are (i) excluded from the formal financial system and (ii) inadequately&#13;
served by the informal financial system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
E. POVERTY MONITORING&#13;
2.30  An independent and effective poverty monitoring system is vital to obtaining an&#13;
accurate identification of the poor, in analyzing the accuracy of targeting benefits, and in&#13;
assessing the impact of poverty reduction activities. Unfortunately, much work has yet to&#13;
be done to establish reliable and comprehensive estimates of poverty. Strategies found that,&#13;
depending on the data source for per capita income, estimates of poverty incidence at the&#13;
provincial level can vary as much as 50 percent. While SSB administers a comprehensive&#13;
rural household survey that gathers data on provincial averages, it does not provide&#13;
infornation at the county level-an absolute necessity in identifying the poor and for&#13;
evaluating changes in poverty. It also does not include sufficient information on important&#13;
correlates of poverty such as household expenditures, education, health, labor mobility and&#13;
credit experience. While other sources of data exist that could augment information&#13;
obtained through the SSB rural household survey, some of that information is not collected&#13;
on a systematic basis and very little data exist on the characteristics of the bottom 5 to 10&#13;
percent of the income distribution.&#13;
F. SELECTION OF PROJECT COUNTIES, TOWNSHIPS AND VILLAGES&#13;
2.31  Selection Process. In order to be able to target meaningful levels of assistance to&#13;
the very poorest households in the project area, it was necessary during project preparation&#13;
to select only a limited number of project counties and a subset of townships and&#13;
administrative villages within those counties. All of the project counties are among the&#13;
nationally designated 8-7 Plan poor counties. Significant income disparities exist within&#13;
these counties, and a key activity during project preparation was to select the poorest&#13;
townships within the project counties for assistance under the project. The principal criteria&#13;
for the selection of project townships and administrative villages were below average per&#13;
capita income levels and grain production. As illustrated in IBRD Map No. 28214, an&#13;
effort was also made to select townships and administrative villages in continuous project&#13;
area blocks in order to improve ease of project implementation. Through this selection&#13;
process, the project will be able to concentrate an average investment of Y 1,300 per person&#13;
on the poorest fifth of the project counties' population.&#13;
2.32  Counties. About 6 million, or about one tenth, of China's remaining absolute poor&#13;
reside in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Ningxia. The 26 project counties are among the poorest of&#13;
the 8-7 Plan counties, with 1995 average rural per capita income levels ranging between&#13;
Y 586 and Y 634, and per capita grain production ranging between 206 kg to 365 kg in that&#13;
year. Poverty incidence, income levels and grain production for the project counties and&#13;
townships, the three project provinces, and China are shown in Table 2.1. These data show&#13;
that between one third to three quarters of the rural population of the project counties are&#13;
absolutely poor. This level of poverty is 6 to 10 times greater than the incidence of rural&#13;
poverty at the national level, and several times greater than the respective provincial&#13;
incidences. Average rural per capita income and grain production in the project counties are&#13;
also substantially less than the provincial and national averages.&#13;

2.33  Townships and Villages. The 26 project counties comprise a total of 1,285&#13;
townships and about 12,670 administrative villages. The project area includes the poorest&#13;
quarter, or some 361, of these townships, and about 90 percent, or some 2,941, of the&#13;
administrative villages in the project townships. (All natural villages in the project&#13;
administrative villages are included in the project.) The exclusion of nearly three quarters&#13;
of the townships in the project counties allows for the targeting of an adequate level of&#13;
investment to the very poorest villages (Box 2.1). The incidence of poverty in the project&#13;
townships ranges between 75 percent in Shaanxi and 88 percent in Ningxia, or between 9&#13;
and 12 times greater than the national average rate. The incidence of poverty within the&#13;
project townships is also several times greater than the respective provincial rates, and&#13;
significantly greater than the respective project county rates. Similarly, average rural per&#13;
capita income and grain production in these project townships are also substantially less&#13;
than the provincial and national averages.&#13;
&#13;

Box 2.1: PROJECT AREA SELECTION-THE POOREST OF THE POOR&#13;
Similar to the other nationally designated poor counties in Shaanxi, Zhenan&#13;
County's average rural per capita net income in 1995 was Y 686, and average rural per&#13;
capita grain production was 275 kg. This level of income was less than half the national&#13;
rural average (Y 1,578) for that year, and about 70 percent of the provincial rural average&#13;
(Y 963). Conditions are even less favorable in the Zhenan County project townships, which&#13;
are located in the more remote upland areas of the county and have only three quarters of&#13;
the county average rural per capita income (see Map IBRD No. 28214).&#13;
Yuquan is a particularly poor project township in Zhenan. Located about 90 km&#13;
away from the county seat, the township's four administrative villages comprise 361&#13;
households scattered in a mountainous area with elevations ranging from 600 to more than&#13;
1,800 meters. The arable land area is extremely limited, and the township average rural per&#13;
capita net income was only Y 429 in 1995-or about one quarter of the national average-&#13;
and average per capita grain production was about 253 kg. Some 80 percent of the&#13;
population lives below the poverty line, and 75 tons of relief grain-or 60 kg per capita-&#13;
are brought into the area annually. The township seat can be reached by a rough dirt road,&#13;
but the township's villages are accessible by foot only. One small hydropower station&#13;
supplies electricity to a quarter of the households.&#13;
One of the villages without road access or electricity is Qianjin Village. Nearly all&#13;
of Qianjin's population are absolutely poor, and the extreme scarcity of flatland has forced&#13;
villagers to extend grain cultivation to higher elevations and steeply sloped hillsides.&#13;
Despite having extended grain cultivation to environmentally fragile hillsides, the villagers&#13;
still depend on relief grain for their survival. Due to Qianj in's isolation, poor infrastructure,&#13;
and limited resources, off-farm income-generating activities are extremely limited.&#13;
Villagers derive their meager cash incomes, which are generally less than Y 100 per capita,&#13;
from raising silkworm cocoons, collecting forest products, and small-scale livestock sales.&#13;
The lack of healthcare workers and adequate medical supplies has resulted in a hygienic&#13;
delivery rate of only 25 percent and an infant and child mortality rate of 18 percent. The&#13;
1995 village survey showed that among the village's 15-year-olds, only one quarter&#13;
graduated from primary school. Not surprisingly, the adult illiteracy rate is close to 80&#13;
percent, and there is no agricultural or other technician in the village and few training or&#13;
extension activities. The village population stood at 1,317 people in 1994. Following 12&#13;
births, 10 deaths, and 9 out-migrations, the village population declined by 7 in 1995. Due&#13;
to the extreme poverty, few women are willing to marry village men and, as a result, the&#13;
adult male to female ratio is at present 2 to 1.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE&#13;
3.1   The principal objectives of the project are to: (a) demonstrate the effectiveness of a&#13;
focused multisectoral rural development project approach to poverty reduction, (b) facilitate&#13;
a "market-friendly" increase in labor mobility from the poor areas to better-off rural and&#13;
rapidly growing urban areas, (c) upgrade poverty monitoring at the national and local levels,&#13;
and (d) significantly reduce absolute poverty in 26 of the very poorest counties in the Qinba&#13;
mountains region. The project would also stabilize or even reverse upland environmental&#13;
destruction through land and pasture improvement and soil conservation works, and&#13;
encourage greater local community participation by enabling households to make key&#13;
decisions during project design and implementation.&#13;
3.2   At present, the LGPR system  at the central, provincial and local levels&#13;
(a) administers a large program of official development assistance (grants, credit and&#13;
standard loans) through the national banking system and (b) coordinates a very wide variety&#13;
of special poor-area projects and specially funded programs supported by each of 27 central&#13;
ministries and agencies (paras. 1.9 and 1.10). These existing poverty reduction programs&#13;
include nearly all sectors and known approaches to poverty reduction. However, the&#13;
various approaches have rarely been integrated at the local level, and the effectiveness of an&#13;
integrated multisectoral package of poverty reduction initiatives has only been tested on a&#13;
large scale in the very poorest upland areas of China through SWPRP. Though much&#13;
smaller in scale and more limited in content than the proposed project, a small number of&#13;
integrated multisectoral rural development projects have also been supported in China by&#13;
several international agencies including UNDP, IFAD, WFP and FAO. The successful&#13;
implementation and favorable impact of SWPRP and these smaller projects strongly&#13;
suggest that the proposed project's integrated multisectoral approach will, particularly for&#13;
the most severely affected resource-deficient areas, prove far more effective in achieving a&#13;
sustainable reduction of China's remaining absolute poverty than have most existing&#13;
unintegrated poverty reduction programs. The Bank Group-supported multisector rural&#13;
development project approach is now becoming the model for extension to China's other&#13;
poor areas and to the overall poverty reduction program.&#13;
B. DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.3   The project would comprise the following six components:&#13;
(a)   labor mobility, through a voluntary system of enhanced rural labor mobility&#13;
for the upland absolute poor, supported by skill training through an&#13;
enterprise reimbursement system, a computerized demand-driven job&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
placement system emphasizing local markets, monitoring of worker safety&#13;
and living conditions, and reporting of abuses and grievances;&#13;
(b)   rural infrastructure, including the labor-intensive construction of rural&#13;
roads, water supply systems, small-scale irrigation, agricultural drainage&#13;
works, biogas digesters, and rural electrification;&#13;
(c)   land and farmer development, using menus of crop and livestock activities&#13;
to increase upland agricultural productivity and reverse the trend of&#13;
environmental degradation through (i) extension of improved agriculture&#13;
and smallholder livestock management techniques and inputs, (ii) establish-&#13;
ment of tree crop nurseries and provision of saplings and tree crop&#13;
management extension, (iii) intensification of staple crop production on the&#13;
modest amount of available flatland, (iv) terracing for improved water and&#13;
soil conservation, and (v) the support of provincial and regional research;&#13;
(d)   TVE development, through support for TVEs consisting of investment&#13;
credit for labor-intensive commercially viable agroprocessing, mineral,&#13;
service and handicraft industries that have strong backward linkages to poor&#13;
households and meet environmental safeguards;&#13;
(e)   microfinance, through a cooperative structure organizing members into&#13;
five-member voluntary joint liability groups, to provide credit services to&#13;
poor households for production activities; and,&#13;
(f)   institution building and poverty monitoring, through (i) improving&#13;
FCPMC and PMOs' capabilities in project design and implementation,&#13;
procurement, accounting, and monitoring and evaluation, and (ii)&#13;
strengthening the poverty monitoring system for the project areas by using&#13;
improved SSB survey instruments to provide a credible and comprehensive&#13;
poverty profile, analyze the accuracy of the targeting of benefits to the&#13;
absolute poor, and measure and evaluate the impact of the project's&#13;
individual components.&#13;
In addition, two social services programs would be undertaken in parallel with the&#13;
project. The Qinba Education Program (QEP), supported under the Fourth Basic&#13;
Education Project (CN-PE-36952) that was presented to the Board in May 1997, would&#13;
increase the access and quality of primary education provided to the poor through facilities&#13;
construction, tuition payments, teacher and management training, and the provision of&#13;
textbooks and instructional equipment.  The Qinba Health Program  (QHP), to be&#13;
supported under the Eighth Basic Health Services Project (CN-PE-3566) that is scheduled&#13;
for Board presentation in FY98, would enhance the availability and delivery of primary&#13;
and curative health care to the poor through health clinic and township hospital renovation&#13;
and construction, the establishment of a village health cooperative fund, the strengthening&#13;
of public health programs in disease prevention and control and for improved maternal and&#13;
child health, and the enhancement of the management capabilities of health administrators&#13;
at the county and provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
C. DETAILED FEATURES&#13;
Enhanced Rural Labor Mobility&#13;
3.4   The project would establish a voluntary labor mobility system  to provide&#13;
employment to about 155,000 upland surplus laborers over six years, and provide an&#13;
important testing ground for assisting the organized flow of rural laborers into China's fast-&#13;
growing cities. Project activities build on existing institutional arrangements and systems&#13;
of the provincial Labor Bureaus, with adjustments to target upland poor surplus laborers.&#13;
The four elements of the labor mobility system are (a) village orientation, (b) on-the-job&#13;
training by enterprises on a cost reimbursement basis, (c) job placement, and (d) monitoring&#13;
worker rights, job safety and living conditions. County Labor Bureaus would target&#13;
project-area poor households with the most surplus labor. The county Labor Bureaus would&#13;
be encouraged to provide a representative share ofjob opportunities to women.&#13;
3.5   Special care would be taken to minimize the risks inherent to labor mobility (para.&#13;
2.28). Safety records and work conditions of joint ventures with fewer than 100 employees&#13;
would be reviewed before workers are placed, since these enterprises have the most&#13;
frequently reported cases of worker abuse and accidents. The provincial and county offices&#13;
of the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) would provide the project's female migrant&#13;
laborers with a special orientation on the risks of labor mobility, including sexual&#13;
exploitation. The China Western Human Resource Development Center (CWHRDC),&#13;
which has already established a highly effective monitoring system focusing on fair&#13;
treatment of workers and workplace safety under SWPRP, would work with LGPR,&#13;
provincial Labor Bureaus and ACWF to monitor and evaluate labor mobility activities.&#13;
Monitoring indicators would include (a) wage and remittance levels, (b) job safety records,&#13;
(c) dormitory conditions, (d) conditions faced by women workers, (e) resolution of labor&#13;
disputes involving migrants, (f) cost per job created, (g) contract completion rates, and&#13;
(h) cost recovery rates. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that (a) labor mobility&#13;
would be strictly voluntary and undertaken on the basis of a program acceptable to the&#13;
Bank Group, (b) a monitoring and reporting system satisfactory to the Bank Group (such as&#13;
that established by CWHRDC for SWPRP, focusing on fair treatment of workers and&#13;
workplace safety) would be finalized and implemented at the provincial and national levels&#13;
no later than September 15, 1997, and (c) the Borrower, as part of its overall project&#13;
monitoring (para. 4.17), would prepare and submit a detailed labor mobility component&#13;
monitoring report to the Bank Group by March 15 and September 15 of each year.&#13;
3.6   Cost recovery through payroll deductions and remittances would contribute to a&#13;
sustainable labor mobility system. The project would conduct village visits to ensure that&#13;
these mechanisms do not cause undue hardship on upland households. Provincial and&#13;
county Labor Bureaus estimate that costs will range from Y 1,100 per job for&#13;
intraprovincial placement to Y 2,000 for distant markets with slightly greater skill training&#13;
requirements. Fixed-cost investments would amount to only Y 100 per migrant for the first&#13;
six years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
3.7   The project would establish a computerized management information system to&#13;
match surplus laborers with job opportunities. This information system would enable&#13;
FCPMC and MOL to spearhead labor migration from the poor project counties to fast-&#13;
growing, highly competitive markets such as Shanghai and Guangzhou. County Labor&#13;
Bureaus and TVE Bureaus would ensure that TVEs supported by the project would hire&#13;
low-skilled workers through the labor mobility system. CWHRDC would be responsible&#13;
for developing a job placement system for interprovincial labor mobility, and would&#13;
provide semiannual analytical reports with statistical summaries, patterned after the&#13;
SWPRP labor mobility component's monitoring reports. Based on existing systems&#13;
already tested during implementation of SWPRP, CWHRDC would train project county&#13;
labor bureau staff in all necessary activities (from village promotion, with targeting of&#13;
poor households with the greatest number of surplus laborers, to data collection,&#13;
orientation, staff training and village-level household monitoring). The county labor&#13;
bureaus would be responsible for labor mobility placement and monitoring for surplus&#13;
workers sent to enterprises within the province, using the same standards and systems as&#13;
CWHRDC. The project would also provide for construction and equipping of office and&#13;
training facilities for this program.&#13;
3.8   A one-year pilot phase would test labor mobility strategies in provincial and distant&#13;
markets before large-scale operations are undertaken. The project would evaluate the use of&#13;
groups, alternative remittance channels to ensure the safe transfer of remittances, payroll&#13;
deductions to cover costs, and the effectiveness of monitoring techniques and remedies.&#13;
Rural Infrastructure&#13;
3.9   The project would support the construction of rural roads, water supply systems,&#13;
small-scale irrigation, rural electrification and biogas digesters.&#13;
3.10  Roads. The project would construct about 892 km of all-weather gravel roads in&#13;
order to link 780 administrative villages in remote mountainous areas to the existing&#13;
network of county and township roads. These roads would be constructed to Class IV road&#13;
standards, with a minimum formation width of 4.5 m and a 3.5 m wide carriageway&#13;
designed for 10-ton vehicular loading on bridges and culverts.&#13;
3.11  Water Supply. Low-cost water supply facilities would be provided to about&#13;
466,000 people in 1,680 villages.  The facilities would tap from  springs, utilize&#13;
groundwater, and divert or pump from streams, and would include piped systems with&#13;
public hydrants, rain collectors serving individual households or several households, and&#13;
shallow wells. Water storages would sustain supply for up to 60 to 70 days in Sichuan and&#13;
Shaanxi and for up to 100 days in Ningxia during the dry seasons. Facilities would be&#13;
designed to supply 15 to 35 liters of water per capita per day, and would meet current water&#13;
quality standards for rural water supply in China. Drinking water for animals would also be&#13;
provided in areas where water sources are sufficient and marginal construction costs are&#13;
reasonable.&#13;
3.12  Irrigation. The project would also construct and improve small-scale irrigation&#13;
works for 8,900 ha of existing and new rice paddy and upland grain crops in Sichuan and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Shaanxi. The irrigation works would include 1 small reservoir storage scheme, 530&#13;
irrigation ponds, 7 small pumping stations, 965 on-farm water cisterns, 43 diversion weirs,&#13;
and 640 km of lined canal. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that all dams&#13;
rehabilitated under the project would be maintained and inspected annually in accordance&#13;
with sound engineering practices, under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank Group. In&#13;
the semiarid areas of Ningxia, the project would construct individually operated&#13;
microirrigation systems with water supplies drawn from shallow wells and small cisterns.&#13;
About 15 tube wells, 2,000 shallow wells, and 21,600 cisterns for rain harvesting would be&#13;
constructed to serve about 5,355 ha of cropland. Some 650 ha of river beach land would&#13;
also be reclaimed in Ningxia for crop production.&#13;
3.13  Rural Energy. The project would also address the power needs of the project area&#13;
by increasing access to electricity and alternative forms of energy. To satisfy power&#13;
requirements for agroprocessing, other light industry, mining, and some household use,&#13;
75 km of 35 kilovolts (kV) and 669 km of 10 kV overhead power transmission and&#13;
distribution lines would be installed. Eight minihydro plants with a total installed capacity&#13;
of 2.2 megawatts (MW) would also be constructed. About 1,830 biogas digesters for&#13;
cooking and lighting would be provided to reduce dependence on scarce fuelwood in some&#13;
project counties in Sichuan.&#13;
Land and Farmer Development&#13;
3.14  Strategy and Farmer Participation. The primary objective of the land and&#13;
farmer development component is to create a substantial and sustainable increase in the&#13;
agricultural productivity and incomes of the 574,000 project households. This objective&#13;
would be reached through the improvement of, and investment in, integrated land use&#13;
systems specific to the Qinba mountains in Shaanxi and Sichuan and to the loess hills in&#13;
Ningxia. In Shaanxi and Sichuan, households would improve grain crop, cash crop and&#13;
feed production on their terraced land, and expand forestry and animal-raising activities&#13;
on their steeply sloped land. In Ningxia, project farmers would construct new terraces,&#13;
establish microirrigation facilities, and adopt appropriate water-saving technologies.&#13;
These and other investments would significantly reduce the adverse impact of spring&#13;
drought on wheat yields, and substantially increase grain and fodder resources for&#13;
livestock. In the context of these improved integrated land use systems, the project&#13;
would offer households in all three project provinces (a) the capacity to intensify&#13;
production on the terraced portion of their cultivated land, (b) a variety of alternative&#13;
income-generating activities in animal, crop and tree production, and (c) increased access&#13;
to training, extension and other agricultural support services.&#13;
3.15  Beneficiary villages and households have participated in the determination of a&#13;
"menu" of alternative land and farmer development component activities, and they will&#13;
play the key role in the actual selection of these activities during implementation. This&#13;
menu includes 62 different agricultural activities, 25 of which are adapted to more&#13;
difficult environments with higher elevation. The development of several activities by a&#13;
single household or in a single village would promote the improvement of households'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
integrated land use systems. The menu of activities includes both short-term and longer-&#13;
term investments, such as animal production and tree crop development (respectively),&#13;
and will help to better integrate animal production with crop production. The project&#13;
merges these activities into individual village development plans, and the design of these&#13;
village plans has reached an advanced stage of preparation. The average investment per&#13;
household is sufficient to give each household in each of the 2,941 project villages the&#13;
opportunity to take part in the component activities. An upper limit to the investment per&#13;
household has been established to further ensure access to project benefits by all&#13;
households.&#13;
3.16 Land Development and Microirrigation. Land development activities would&#13;
target all villages and most households, and would increase the proportion of arable&#13;
flatland from 28 percent at present to 47 percent at full development. The project would&#13;
build about 65,080 ha of new terraces, including 26,755 ha of stonewall terraces and&#13;
2,760 ha of earthwall terraces in the Sichuan and Shaanxi mountains, 15,580 ha of&#13;
earthwall terraces in the Sichuan hills, and 20,000 ha of mechanically built loess terraces&#13;
in Ningxia. In addition, the project would construct and improve small-scale irrigation&#13;
and drainage works for 8,300 ha of waterlogged paddy fields in the Sichuan hills. First-&#13;
year applications of phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer (and potassium in Sichuan) would&#13;
be provided on newly developed land.&#13;
3.17  Food and Cash Crops.  The project would promote improved technology&#13;
packages for the 73,390 ha of newly built terraces in the three provinces and the newly&#13;
drained paddy fields in Sichuan. These packages would support hybrid corn in Sichuan&#13;
and Shaanxi, microirrigated corn in Ningxia, and improved varieties and technologies for&#13;
the other major grain and oilseed crops. The project would supply households with one&#13;
year of quality inputs (seeds, plastic mulch, and pesticides) for corn (33,300 ha), wheat&#13;
(14,300 ha), potatoes (14,800 ha), linseed in Ningxia (1,800 ha), and rapeseed in Sichuan&#13;
(150 ha). Sets of basic tools, including hoes, sickles and manual cornstalk choppers,&#13;
would also be provided. The project packages would combine these external inputs with&#13;
the extension of improved practices to enhance long-term soil fertility and water&#13;
efficiency. Such practices include sowing along contour lines, and balanced applications&#13;
of organic manure and chemical fertilizers. Five species of medicinal plants and tubers&#13;
would be introduced in project villages on 8,630 ha (mostly in Shaanxi), and 1,500 ha of&#13;
commercial vegetables would be developed. Among these cash crops species, Shaanxi&#13;
plans to develop 5,500 ha of peltate yam, a tuber used by the pharmaceutical industry. It&#13;
is expected that 20 percent of project households would take part in the development of&#13;
these cash crops.&#13;
3.18  Animal Production. Nearly half of project households in Sichuan and Shaanxi,&#13;
and about 90 percent of project households in Ningxia, would invest in raising additional&#13;
goat and sheep (345,500 head), pigs and sows (312,500 head), cattle (62,100 head),&#13;
poultry and other animals. The investment would include young animals, simple&#13;
upgrading of animal housing, and feed additives for the first year. The expansion of&#13;
animal numbers would increase current animal feed requirements by about one third.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
Project-supported fodder development activities would focus on improving winter fodder&#13;
resources and feeding practices. In Ningxia, an increase of 2,800 ha in the area of cut-&#13;
and-carry alfalfa, and the introduction of corn on 7,100 ha, would provide 40 percent of&#13;
the requirements of additional animal numbers. The remaining 60 percent would be&#13;
provided by natural rangeland at higher elevations and by resources made available by the&#13;
expected out-migration of about one third of project-area households. In Sichuan and&#13;
Shaanxi, fodder development would comprise the introduction of cut-and-carry fodder&#13;
species, such as ryegrass and clover, on 6,500 ha, and the extension of hay technology&#13;
and cornstalk manual chopping. In the three provinces, a total of 60,400 ammoniated&#13;
straw tanks would help improve the efficiency of feeding systems based on straw and cut-&#13;
and-carry fodder. Incremental pig feed requirements would be met by increases in the&#13;
yields of sweet potatoes, potatoes and rice bran on newly developed land, and the&#13;
extension of arrowroot.&#13;
3.19 Perennial Crops. In Sichuan and Shaanxi, about 15 percent of households would&#13;
initiate the production of silkworm cocoons or expand their current production. They&#13;
would plant the equivalent of 4,100 ha of mulberry, and rehabilitate 800 ha through the&#13;
grafting of existing plantations. Most mulberry trees would be interplanted on terrace&#13;
edges. Some 5,200 ha of cultivated land, mainly lower-yielding land, would be converted&#13;
into plantations of tea (1,900 ha) and seven fruit tree species. About one third of project&#13;
households would develop nontimber forest product species on 19,200 ha. The 10&#13;
species to be developed are mainly chestnuts and walnuts (10,000 ha), and species&#13;
yielding medicinal products including Eucommia (3,800 ha) and gingko (2,500 ha).&#13;
Some 1,800 ha of timber (regeneration of oak, and plantation of timber species) would&#13;
also be developed. In Ningxia, some 700 ha of microirrigated orchard would be&#13;
developed by individual households. The equivalent of 1,200 ha of antierosion belts&#13;
would be planted along terrace edges. The main species would be Caragana microphylla,&#13;
a leguminous bush yielding both fodder and fuelwood. Technical packages for each&#13;
perennial crop variety comprising varieties, interplanting schemes, pruning, fertilizer&#13;
application rates, pesticides, on-farm storage and packaging have been designed in each&#13;
county (with provincial support) in accordance with local environmental conditions and&#13;
long-term market needs and risks. The project would closely supervise the provision of&#13;
certified quality seedlings, and provide annual requirements of quality chemical fertilizers&#13;
and pesticides until the first year of production (that is, for a period of 2 to 5 years).&#13;
3.20  Land Use Rights. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the project&#13;
provinces would ensure that project households would receive individual land use rights&#13;
for a term of not less than 30 years for the land they terrace, irrigate, drain, or plant to&#13;
perennial crops under the project. Land development would be a household-based&#13;
activity and would take place in locations that individual households consider to best fit&#13;
their land use systems. Plantations of perennial crops would be established and managed&#13;
by individual households. Households would retain the right to plant perennial crops&#13;
developed under the project either in their homeplots, on field edges, in their individual&#13;
forest and wasteland areas, or on forestland under the control of Forestry Bureaus. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
townships under the Yangtze watershed forestry program in Sichuan and Shaanxi, the&#13;
project would facilitate the implementation of this program on a household basis.&#13;
3.21  Training, Extension and Support Services. During the first years of the project,&#13;
more than 355,000 farmers would attend an average of four days of training. Training&#13;
contents would comprise a wide range of technical and economic management skills.&#13;
Activities would be specifically focused on illiterate women farmers in Ningxia. The&#13;
project would provide 166 small pickups, 182 motorcycles and 300 sets of extension&#13;
equipment to enable township technicians to increase their visits to project villages.&#13;
Township veterinary services would be strengthened, and a total of 130 sets of small&#13;
equipment would be provided for township and village veterinarians.  A budget&#13;
equivalent to one year of vaccination costs for all additional animals would be made&#13;
available to township veterinary stations. In Ningxia, township artificial insemination&#13;
services for cows would also be strengthened.&#13;
3.22  The project would promote greater household participation in agricultural&#13;
extension and support services. About 2,900 village farmer-technicians would join&#13;
annual five-day training sessions. In Sichuan and Shaanxi, farmer-technician training&#13;
would focus on training lead farmers, both young farmers and women farm heads. In&#13;
Ningxia, the project would build a network of demonstration sites located along&#13;
countryside roads, with two demonstration farmers in each project village. Other skilled&#13;
households would become suppliers of tree seedlings and grow a total of 237 ha of&#13;
nurseries (Sichuan and Shaanxi), provide services for pesticide spraying and portable&#13;
pumps (Sichuan hills), mechanized cornstalk shredding and husking (Sichuan and&#13;
Ningxia), potato starch extraction (Ningxia), crossbreeding of local pigs and goats with&#13;
improved breeds (Sichuan), and cash crop seed production (Shaanxi). In addition, seed&#13;
companies would expand their multiplication area of virus-free potatoes, corn, hybrid rice&#13;
and wheat seeds by 2,800 ha.&#13;
3.23 Applied Agricultural Technology Program (AATP). The project would&#13;
employ provincial research institutions to initiate applied agricultural research tailored to&#13;
the project area needs. Priority research needs have been selected by the provincial&#13;
PMOs (a list is provided in Annex 3) and research contracts are being drafted. The&#13;
transfer of research and technical assistance outcomes to extension agents and farmers&#13;
would take place during project implementation.&#13;
TVE Development&#13;
3.24  TVEs are a cost-effective means of creating stable jobs for unskilled workers and&#13;
spurring economic development in small towns and rural areas. All TVE investments&#13;
provisionally accepted for inclusion in this project were proposed, and are sponsored by,&#13;
local governments in the project provinces, counties, townships, and villages. They were&#13;
subjected to five selection criteria to maximize benefits to the poor: (a) cost per job created,&#13;
(b) commercial feasibility, (c) worker safety and environmental risks, (d) skills training, and&#13;
(e) backward linkages to products produced by project households. Selected TVEs would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
add significant local value to existing and planned agriculture and mineral production.&#13;
Commercial feasibility has been analyzed by reviewing trends in demand and prices in&#13;
local, regional and national markets. A number of proposed TVEs did not meet the five&#13;
criteria and were rejected, and others were modified during project preparation. TVE&#13;
subprojects to be implemented by enterprises (as opposed to government units) would be&#13;
financed under subloans made by the project provinces on ABC's standard interest terms&#13;
for similar activities. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that (a) the project&#13;
provinces would be required to complete appraisal of the TVE activities in accordance with&#13;
guidelines acceptable to the Bank Group, (b) these activities would be included in the&#13;
project subject to the Bank Group's final approval, and (c) for TVE subprojects&#13;
implemented by enterprises, the enterprise would have to demonstrate its creditworthiness&#13;
and Bank Group funds would be onlent on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group.&#13;
3.25  TVE Portfolio Composition. The TVE component is expected to support 171&#13;
enterprises, including the expansion or creation of 125 agroprocessing firms, 16 mining and&#13;
construction materials operations, 9 handicrafts manufacturers, and 21 farmers' markets,&#13;
creating about 33, 850 low-skill jobs in local towns. Agroprocessing activities include&#13;
forest products, tea, fruits and vegetables, animals, and a wide range of local food and&#13;
medicinal products. The average TVE investment would be Y 3.2 million, and would&#13;
provide employment for 225 upland migrants, at a cost of Y 15,000 ($1,800) per job.&#13;
Women would make up at least 80 percent of the labor force in some sectors, such as carpet&#13;
weaving, embroidery and fruit processing.&#13;
3.26  The farmers' markets would be established to provide poor farmers in project areas&#13;
with affordable access to inputs and profitable outlets for products. The location of farmers'&#13;
markets would be linked to rural road construction. Each province has selected three&#13;
farmers' markets for the one-year pilot phase, which would be evaluated based on the&#13;
following: (a) access to affordable inputs by poor households, (b) market prices for&#13;
products made by poor farmers, and (c) market occupancy rates and financial sustainability.&#13;
Based on an evaluation of the nine pilot farmers' markets, adjustments would be made to&#13;
the design, number and location of the remaining markets in latter years of the project.&#13;
3.27 Worker Safety and Environmental Risks. All TVEs would meet existing&#13;
national environmental standards for water, soil, and air quality and noise pollution. The&#13;
TVE feasibility studies include assessment of environmental risks and risk abatement&#13;
measures. The studies will be reviewed by the provincial and county Environmental&#13;
Protection Bureaus (EPBs), which must approve new and expanded TVE facilities under&#13;
national regulations. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that, as a prerequisite to&#13;
inclusion of a TVE activity, the provincial EPBs would (a) determine whether the TVE&#13;
would require effluent treatment facilities, (b) review and approve the final designs of the&#13;
necessary effluent treatment facilities prior to beginning construction, and (c) supervise the&#13;
plant's implementation and maintenance of effluent monitoring and treatment systems. Key&#13;
monitoring indicators include wage and remittance levels, enterprise profitability and&#13;
worker safety records. In addition, in cases in which land acquisition is required for TVE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
development, the payment of timely and adequate compensation will be monitored, based&#13;
on Chinese regulations and Bank Group policy. Food processing TVEs would be subject to&#13;
regular sanitary inspections by local health authorities.&#13;
Microfinance&#13;
3.28  The microfinance component would establish a sustainable financial system to&#13;
provide working capital loans to microenterprises run by poor households in project&#13;
areas. After initial support from the Qinba project, the loan portfolio would be largely&#13;
financed by loan installment repayments, available local funds (such as poverty&#13;
alleviation funds), fees and savings generated by poor households. The component would&#13;
finance loans made by two autonomous cooperatives in Langzhong County (Sichuan) and&#13;
Ankang City (Shaanxi), and provide technical assistance to these entities. Over a six-year&#13;
period, 16,000 households would receive working capital loans and establish savings&#13;
accounts.&#13;
3.29 Methodology and Organization. The cooperatives would apply an adaptation of&#13;
the Grameen Bank model, which uses a joint liability group lending methodology. The&#13;
branches would be profit centers, and loan officers would receive incentives based on the&#13;
performance of their individual and the branch loan portfolio. By the end of the sixth&#13;
year, the average loan officer would serve 300 clients. Loan officers would help the&#13;
group to obtain technical assistance from relevant county bureaus. The cooperative&#13;
would use "portfolio-at-risk" to track portfolio quality, classifying each loan with one&#13;
installment more than one day late as an overdue loan. There would be regular internal&#13;
and annual external audits.&#13;
3.30  The cooperative would encourage poor households to form voluntary groups of&#13;
five members, who provide a joint guarantee for working capital loans as an alternative to&#13;
physical collateral. Participating households that receive loans would already have&#13;
experience in at least one productive activity, be self-sufficient in grain production, and&#13;
be deemed creditworthy by other members in the group. The majority of group members&#13;
would be women. Groups would approve the loan application by individual members,&#13;
select the order in which members receive loans, maintain financial records on loans,&#13;
savings, and repayment, participate in production training sessions, and would be jointly&#13;
responsible for on-time repayment of loan installments. Average loan processing time&#13;
(from application to disbursement) would be less than two weeks. Larger loans would be&#13;
offered once all members have repaid every installment on time.&#13;
3.31  Financial Services. The cooperative would offer working capital loans based on&#13;
the cashflow generated by an activity, and the initial loan would be between Y 400 to&#13;
Y 700. Loans would be one year in duration, including a two-week grace period and 34&#13;
equal 10-day installments of principal, interest and compulsory savings. Borrowers&#13;
would select their investments based on a wide menu of technically viable productive&#13;
activities, such as agricultural processing (including oilseed and fodder), animal&#13;
husbandry (such as pigs, sheep, oxen), cash crops (such as traditional medicines and tea),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
small stores, trade, and small service businesses (such as food preparation, and electrical&#13;
and agricultural appliance repair). Group members would approve the application before&#13;
it is submitted to the loan officer. The loan officer would review the proposed activity to&#13;
ensure that it can generate adequate cashflow to cover the loan installments.&#13;
3.32  Based on local demand, up to 10 percent of a branch's outstanding loan portfolio&#13;
could be used for larger loans to established microenterprises in Langzhong and Ankang&#13;
project areas that need to purchase equipment. These would be individual loans with a&#13;
physical collateral guarantee, and would not exceed Y 8,000. Approval criteria for these&#13;
loans would include the generation of cashflow to cover loan installments, commercial&#13;
viability and jobs creation for surplus laborers from project-area poor households.&#13;
3.33  For both types of loans, the effective interest rate and application and other fees&#13;
charged would be sufficient to cover all operational costs and the unsubsidized cost of&#13;
funds. Poverty-related research expenses and social welfare services would not be carried&#13;
out directly by the loan staff of the cooperative and would not be included in the&#13;
calculation of the interest rate. Assurances were obtained that Bank Group proceeds&#13;
would be onlent to the cooperatives (a) by the project provinces for 15 years, including 5&#13;
years of grace, at an annual interest rate of at least 2.88 percent, and (b) on conditions&#13;
acceptable to the Bank Group, including that the cooperatives have adopted an&#13;
acceptable operating manual governing their lending operations.&#13;
Institution Building and Poverty Monitoring&#13;
3.34 Institution Building. With the exception of SWPRP, the LGPR system has only&#13;
limited experience with the detailed design and implementation of large multisectoral&#13;
projects. There is a need, therefore, to enhance the capacities of the LGPR system,&#13;
including the three project provincial PADOs and the county- and lower-level PMOs, in&#13;
project planning, design, management and monitoring. The institution-building component&#13;
will better equip the provinces and counties to meet the formidable challenge of integrated&#13;
upland area development.   The institution building component would include:&#13;
(a) institutional design, including the design of organizational setup, definition of functions&#13;
and establishment of project implementation and management procedures; (b) human&#13;
resource development, including training and technical assistance; (c) provision of facilities,&#13;
including office space, office furniture and equipment, and vehicles; and (d) development of&#13;
a computer-based information system to facilitate project management and monitoring.&#13;
Due to the program-lending nature of the project, special attention would be paid to&#13;
upgrading the PMOs' abilities in development planning, project selection and appraisal, and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of project implementation.&#13;
3.35  Research, Training and Technical Assistance. The project would fund research,&#13;
local and overseas training, study tours and technical assistance comprising both foreign&#13;
and local consultants. Each project component (except for rural infrastructure and TVE&#13;
development) includes research, training and technical assistance. An assurance was&#13;
obtained at negotiations that FCPMC would provide an annual plan to the Bank Group by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
December I of each year that would include a list of proposed research, training, study&#13;
tours and technical assistance under the projectfor the coming year.&#13;
3.36  Poverty Monitoring. The establishment of an objective poverty monitoring system&#13;
is essential to achieving the project's principal objective of demonstrating the effectiveness&#13;
of a focused multisectoral rural development project approach to poverty reduction. In&#13;
collaboration with ongoing Bank work with SSB (para 1.8), the project would develop such&#13;
a system for the project area using improved survey instruments based upon similar&#13;
activities under SWPRP. The system would provide a credible and comprehensive poverty&#13;
profile for the project areas, analyze the accuracy of targeting benefits to the absolute poor,&#13;
and measure and evaluate the impact of the project's individual components. It would&#13;
provide an important testing ground for assisting the establishment of a national poverty&#13;
monitoring system that would, in turn, serve as an important underpinning of the&#13;
Government's overall poverty reduction program.&#13;
3.37  The four main elements of this project component would be to (a) upgrade the&#13;
existing poverty monitoring system developed under SWPRP in order to adapt it to the&#13;
conditions of the Qinba mountains region and more fully exploit the potential of the survey&#13;
instruments for project evaluation, (b) undertake baseline and annual follow-up surveys,&#13;
(c) process and analyze the collected survey data, and (d) disseminate findings and&#13;
information. The project poverty monitoring system has been built upon SSB's existing&#13;
rural household survey instruments, with appropriate adjustments to cover the project area,&#13;
decrease the number of questions, and improve the individual and community modules to&#13;
incorporate important questions on household expenditure, education, health, labor mobility&#13;
and credit experience. For the baseline and annual follow-up surveys, SSB would design,&#13;
test and modify questionnaires during the first half of 1997. The baseline survey would be&#13;
undertaken in December 1997 and follow-up surveys would be carried out annually in&#13;
December for the duration of project implementation. FCPMC and SSB would collaborate&#13;
on data processing and analysis, and the publication of an annual summary report.&#13;
Social Services&#13;
3.38  In addition to the six project components, two social services programs would be&#13;
undertaken in parallel with the project (para. 3.3). QEP and QHP would facilitate the&#13;
development of locally funded and managed education and health systems for the absolute&#13;
poor at the village level. The education and health programs concentrate investment in&#13;
village-level basic infrastructure, upgrading the quality and reliability of services, and the&#13;
development of mechanisms to ensure access to social services by the absolute poor. QEP&#13;
and QHP include mechanisms to ensure sustainability.&#13;
3.39 Education Program. Consistent with national plans for six-year UBE by 2000 in&#13;
China's poor areas (para. 2.11), QEP would address low educational attainment among the&#13;
poor in the project areas by enhancing the delivery of primary education through&#13;
(a) renovation and construction of school buildings and facilities, (b) provision of tuition&#13;
assistance for poor students, (c) provision of textbooks, instructional equipment and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
furniture, and (d) teacher and management training. Due to the disproportionately low&#13;
levels of female enrollment and retention (para 2.12) in the project area, the project's target&#13;
of six-year UBE strongly favors girls' education. In addition, a special effort would be&#13;
made, over both the short and long term, to attract qualified female teachers who would&#13;
serve as role models to encourage the education of girls. The education program would be&#13;
funded and implemented under the Fourth Basic Education Project (CN-PE-36952). An&#13;
assurance was obtained at negotiations that each project province would implement an&#13;
education program acceptable to the Bank Group.&#13;
3.40 Health Program. QHP would strengthen the health network by increasing the&#13;
accessibility and enhancing the quality of health services provided to the poor at the village&#13;
and township level. This would occur primarily through (a) construction of health facilities,&#13;
(b) establishing a village cooperative medical fund, (c) upgrading and provision of essential&#13;
equipment, (d) enhancing the stability and quality of the rural health work force through&#13;
training and salary assistance, (e) strengthening public health programs in disease&#13;
prevention and control and maternal and child health care (MCH), and (f) increasing the&#13;
management capabilities of health administrators at the county and provincial level. The&#13;
health program is expected to be funded and implemented under the Eighth Basic Health&#13;
Services project (CN-PE-3566). An assurance was obtained at negotiations that each&#13;
project province would implement a health program acceptable to the Bank Group, and to&#13;
this end, they would furnish to the Bank Group by December 1 in each year (commencing&#13;
December 1, 1998) its annual plan for health activities for the following year (including a&#13;
budget and financing plan) and carry out such plan as would be agreed with the Bank&#13;
Group.&#13;
D. STATUS OF PREPARATION&#13;
3.41  Feasibility studies have been completed for the three provinces and all 26 project&#13;
counties, including representative designs for all the subprojects, and comprehensive&#13;
development plans for selected administrative villages. The three provincial studies and 26&#13;
county studies have been thoroughly reviewed by the Bank (6 counties) and by FCPMC and&#13;
the provincial PMOs (all counties) prior to and during appraisal. Extensive revisions have&#13;
been made in accordance with the recommendations of these reviews. Implementation of&#13;
(a) pilot programs for the labor mobility, microfinance, and social services components,&#13;
(b) several of the comprehensive village development programs in each county, (c) the full&#13;
range of project components in Wangcang, Xuanhan, Zhenan, Ankang, Xiji and Tongxin&#13;
counties, and (d) institution building at the provincial and county levels began in January&#13;
1997. During the early stages of implementation, and in accordance with the Government's&#13;
basic investment project review and approval process and Bank Group requirements,&#13;
detailed implementation plans and engineering designs for each project component would&#13;
be carefully reviewed by the PMOs at all levels and concerned technical departments.&#13;
E. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.42  The project would be implemented during a period of six years beginning in August&#13;
1997, with completion in July 2003. All components would take the full span of six years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
to implement. For the labor mobility component, orientation training would precede the&#13;
placement of workers in new jobs. Operations would be modest in scale in the first year,&#13;
but would increase in the second and following years. For the land and farmer development&#13;
component, due to the comparatively long growth period before maturation, fruit crops&#13;
would be established during the first four years of the project. Terracing would be followed&#13;
by crop establishment on newly terraced land.  Farmers' training would also be&#13;
concentrated in the first three years. Implementation of cash crop and livestock activities&#13;
would be undertaken over the full six-year period. For the rural infrastructure component,&#13;
rural energy in Sichuan and microirrigation systems in Ningxia would be completed in the&#13;
four years beginning 1997. All other subcomponents would scheduled over the full six-year&#13;
period. For the TVE development component, the farmers' markets subcomponent would&#13;
be implemented through a phased approach (para. 3.26). Other TVE subcomponents,&#13;
including agroprocessing and various light industrial development projects, would be&#13;
scheduled over a five-year period due to the flexibility needed to respond to the changing&#13;
market situation. The microfinance component will be implemented in several credit cycles&#13;
over five years.&#13;
F. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.43  Costs.  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is&#13;
estimated at Y 2.99 billion ($360 million). The foreign exchange costs are estimated to be&#13;
Y 896 million ($108 million), or 30 percent of the total. Taxes and duties are not included&#13;
in the estimated costs. The cost estimates are based on unit prices currently prevailing in&#13;
the project area and derived from typical designs. Base cost is expressed in late 1996&#13;
prices. Physical contingencies average about 5 percent of base cost. Price contingency&#13;
estimates average 25 percent of base cost, and have been calculated for both foreign and&#13;
local costs using the Bank Group's estimated annual escalation factors. Physical and price&#13;
contingencies amount to Y 683 million ($82 million).  Estimated project costs are&#13;
summarized in Table 3.1 and detailed in Annex 5.&#13;
3.44 Financing. The proposed IDA (ITF) Credit of SDR 108.5 million ($150 million&#13;
equivalent), which would be funded under the Interim Trust Fund (ITF) as administered by&#13;
IDA, and IBRD Loan of $30 million would cover 50 percent of total project costs and all of&#13;
the foreign exchange component. The remaining project costs would be financed by central&#13;
and local governments and the beneficiaries as detailed in Table 3.2.&#13;

and August 1996, will be applied to all Bank-financed procurement of goods and works.&#13;
The Model Documents that have been agreed between the Ministry of Finance (MOF)&#13;
and the Bank Group in July 1996 would be adopted for all international competitive&#13;
bidding (ICB) and national competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works and goods, and the&#13;
Standard Bid Evaluation Form would be used. Procurement of items to be financed out&#13;
of the proceeds of the ITF Credit would be subject to the special eligibility requirements&#13;
applicable to ITF Credits.&#13;

3.47  Works. Civil works worth about $197 million would be required for the project&#13;
including earth and stone work, structures for irrigation and rural water supply systems,&#13;
roads and rural energy, buildings, crop establishment and livestock maintenance. These&#13;
works would be scattered over 26 counties and carried out over five years, and would be too&#13;
dispersed to be of interest to international construction companies. As a result, no&#13;
procurement of works through ICB is planned. Instead, about $27.7 million of civil works&#13;
would be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank Group for rural&#13;
electricity, larger structures and buildings, and farmers' markets. The maximum size of&#13;
contract to be let through NCB would be no more than $2.5 million. Other civil works, not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
exceeding $100,000 each in value and with an aggregate value of about $84.9 million,&#13;
comprising land development, minor structures and buildings, and village roads, would be&#13;
too small, widely scattered and labor-intensive to be suitable for competitive contracting,&#13;
and would be undertaken with the Bank's prior consent through force account by local labor&#13;
forces (mostly farmers) mobilized by counties and townships. Crop establishment ($37.7&#13;
million) and livestock maintenance ($46.2 million) works would be undertaken through&#13;
force account by participating farmers.&#13;
3.48  Goods. Goods worth about $76.3 million would be required for the project. ICB&#13;
procedures would be used for fertilizer, plastic sheeting, vehicles, computers and office&#13;
equipment amounting to about $40.0 million, or more than half of all goods. Qualified&#13;
domestic bidders competing under ICB will be eligible for a 15 percent preference in bid&#13;
evaluation, or customs duties and import tax payable by a nonexempt importer, whichever&#13;
is less. ICB contracts would be grouped into packages of $200,000 or more. Pesticides&#13;
amounting to $3.2 million would be procured through limited international bidding as there&#13;
are only a limited number of suppliers of such specialized items who could offer&#13;
competitive prices.&#13;
3.49 NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank Group, in which foreign suppliers may&#13;
participate, would be used to procure contracts under $200,000 totaling about $24.2 million&#13;
worth of goods including office equipment, small agricultural and agroprocessing&#13;
machinery, equipment, and motorcycles. All contracts under $50,000 for goods would be&#13;
procured through national shopping in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group. National shopping would total $8.9 million and would cover small irrigation pumps&#13;
and pipes, and small quantities of equipment, instruments and miscellaneous goods.&#13;
3.50  Other Procurement. Labor training and placement ($43.4 million), and research,&#13;
training, and technical assistance ($11.0 million) would be carried out based on programs&#13;
agreed with the Bank Group. Goods and works required for microfinance subloans, which&#13;
would not be expected to cost more than $1,000 per subproject and total $3.6 million in&#13;
aggregate, would be procured by farm households at reasonable price and taking account of&#13;
quality and reliability. Certain incremental recurrent operating costs of project management&#13;
would be paid against an agreed schedule of costs. Consultants would be employed in&#13;
accordance with the Bank Group Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.8 All consultants&#13;
required for the project are expected to be individuals who would be employed in&#13;
accordance with the procedures applicable to individual consultants. In the unlikely event&#13;
that a firm were to be hired, Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) procedures would&#13;
be followed.&#13;
3.51  Review of Bid Documents and Contracts.  Bidding documents for works&#13;
contracts estimated to exceed $2.5 million in value and goods packages in excess of&#13;
$200,000 would be subject to prior review by the Bank Group. This would cover&#13;
8 "Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," January 1997 and&#13;
the Model Contract Documents for Consultant Services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42 -&#13;
approximately 20 goods packages over the six-year implementation period. Consistent with&#13;
the relatively small size and diverse nature of the goods, this would represent about 30&#13;
percent of total goods in value. Bidding documents for the first three works and the first&#13;
three goods contracts to be let through NCB in each province, and consultants' contracts&#13;
estimated to exceed $100,000 in the case of firms and $50,000 in the case of individual&#13;
consultants, would also be subject to prior review by the Bank Group. Other contracts&#13;
would be subject to ex-post review by supervision missions. During the first year of&#13;
implementation, the ex-post review target would be 1 in 20 contracts. Based on experience&#13;
in the first year, the target ratio would be adjusted. Standard bidding documents approved&#13;
by the Bank Group would be used.9 Other contracts would be subject to selective review&#13;
after bid awards. MIN-METALS International Tendering Company and the CNCCC&#13;
International Tendering Company have been appointed procurement agents for the project.&#13;
H. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.52  Proceeds of the IDA (ITF) credit would be disbursed as summarized in Table 3.4.&#13;
Disbursement for vehicles, computers, equipment for agroprocessing and other TVEs,&#13;
fertilizer, pesticides, and plastic sheeting would be at 100 percent of the foreign exchange&#13;
costs of imported items and 100 percent of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured&#13;
items. Disbursement for other goods procured locally would be 75 percent of local&#13;
expenditure. Disbursement for overseas and domestic training and study tours, technical&#13;
assistance, international and domestic consultants services, and applied agricultural research&#13;
would also be at 100 percent of total costs. Disbursement for labor training and placement&#13;
under the labor mobility component, and operating costs for project management and&#13;
supervision would be 50 percent of total costs. Disbursement for crop establishment,&#13;
livestock maintenance, terracing, rural roads, water supply, irrigation works and energy, and&#13;
other works would be at 35 percent of total expenditures. Disbursement for subloans under&#13;
the microfinance component would be 50 percent of amounts paid by the cooperative.&#13;
3.53  Disbursement for the first three contracts for goods and works under NCB for each&#13;
province, for works contracts of $2.5 million equivalent or more, for goods contracts of&#13;
$200,000 equivalent or more, and for consultancy contracts of $100,000 equivalent for&#13;
firms and $50,000 equivalent or more for individuals, would be made on the basis of full&#13;
documentation. Disbursement for contracts for works, goods, and consultant contracts&#13;
below those amounts, and all training would be on the basis of Statements of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs). Disbursements would also be made against SOEs in the case of labor training and&#13;
placement, subloans under the microfinance component, and research, study tours, and&#13;
works carried out by force account. SOEs would be supported by progress reports showing&#13;
physical quantities and unit prices (the latter would be updated annually by FCPMC and the&#13;
provincial PMOs and reviewed by the Bank Group). Supporting documentation would be&#13;
9 Includes prequalification, notice of invitation to bid, bid documents, bid evaluation forms, and contracts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
retained by the PMOs and made available to local audit bureaus and to Bank Group&#13;
supervision missions, which would both randomly field check such physical records from&#13;
time to time.&#13;

3.54  The project is expected to be completed by July 31, 2003 and the closing date would&#13;
be January 31, 2004. China enjoys a favorable record in project implementation and&#13;
disbursement that is superior to Bank Group and Asia averages. The project disbursement&#13;
profile is consistent with other rural development projects in China. The estimated&#13;
disbursement schedule is given in Annex 8.&#13;
3.55  Special Account. To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account will be established&#13;
in a bank acceptable to the Bank Group. The Special Account will have an authorized&#13;
allocation of $10 million, which is equal to its estimated four-month average disbursement.&#13;
Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or&#13;
whenever the Special Account is drawn down to 50 percent of its initial deposit, whichever&#13;
comes first.&#13;
3.56  Retroactive Financing.  Due to the need to establish implementation and&#13;
coordination procedures for this complex project in advance of full implementation,&#13;
retroactive financing is recommended for expenditures incurred for (a) initiating the labor&#13;
mobility, microfinance, and institution building components, (b) establishing tree nurseries&#13;
and terracing, and (c) commencing the full range of activities in selected "prototype"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
counties (para. 3.8) and the village comprehensive development programs in all counties.&#13;
Retroactive financing would be for expenditures incurred after February 1, 1997 and before&#13;
the date of signing of the Loan and ITF Credit Agreements. The total disbursable amount&#13;
would be up to SDR 13 million equivalent.&#13;
I. ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT&#13;
3.57  The provincial and county PMOs would maintain records of all project component&#13;
expenditures. These records would be forwarded regularly to FCPMC for consolidation,&#13;
review, and audit. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that consolidated accounts&#13;
would be maintainedfor annual auditing by auditors acceptable to the Bank Group and&#13;
that the audited accounts, including the Special Account, together with the auditor's report&#13;
would be submitted to the Bank Group within six months of the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
Audited accounts would include details on the use of the Special Account, withdrawals&#13;
from the Loan and Credit account made on the basis of SOEs, including actual physical&#13;
completion of claimed works to agreed standards, and the auditors' opinion as to whether&#13;
such withdrawals were made against expenditures eligible for Bank Group disbursement.&#13;
J. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT&#13;
3.58  Overall, the project is expected to have a favorable environmental impact. The land&#13;
and farmer development component would make significant contributions to the mitigation&#13;
of the existing environmental problems in the project areas of severe soil erosion and&#13;
degraded vegetative cover (AnnexI3). To limit any potential negative environmental&#13;
impacts of project activities, assurances were obtained at negotiations that (a) pesticides to&#13;
be provided under the project would be approved by the Bank Group and would be stored&#13;
and handled in accordance with guidelines satisfactory to the Bank Group, and (b) all&#13;
project activities would comply with sound environmental standards, and necessary&#13;
mitigation actions to fulfill the recommendations contained in the Environmental&#13;
Assessment Report would be included in the annual work programs forwarded to the Bank&#13;
Group.&#13;
3.59 Other components would take all necessary actions to minimize negative effects on&#13;
the environment. One of the five TVE selection criteria is the likely environmental impact,&#13;
and several proposed enterprises were eliminated on this basis. Project TVEs would&#13;
address environmental issues during the design stage, and would submit plans to the&#13;
provincial and county EPBs in conformance with national pollution control requirements.&#13;
During this review process, special attention has been and would be given to controlling&#13;
emissions and effluents, which are by-products of production processes. Food processing&#13;
TVEs would also be subject to regular sanitary inspections by local health authorities.&#13;
3.60  TVE establishment and expansion, road construction, and other project activities&#13;
would require acquisition of less than 130 ha of cultivated land. Under current land&#13;
acquisition plans, about 2,570 persons would be affected, though none would lose their&#13;
homes. Resettlement planning principles and policies, and a resettlement action plan (RAP)&#13;
acceptable to the Bank Group, have been prepared. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
negotiations that (a) resettlement required under the project would be carried out in&#13;
accordance with this RAP, and (b) any currently unanticipated resettlement would be&#13;
carried out in accordance with a RAP developed on the basis of these principles and&#13;
policies and approved by the Bank Group.&#13;
3.61   Social Aspects. The project components directly address the fundamental social&#13;
problems in the project area of grossly inadequate educational attainment, excessive&#13;
morbidity and mortality, severe underemployment, and the lack of access to roads, safe&#13;
drinking water and electricity. During project preparation, there has been careful targeting&#13;
of the poorest upland counties, townships and villages (paras. 2.31 to 2.33). The education&#13;
program includes the recruitment of women teachers and administrators and strongly favors&#13;
girls' primary education, and the health program would reduce maternal and child&#13;
morbidity and mortality.&#13;
3.62  The most significant social risks are related to the participation of large numbers of&#13;
women in the innovative labor mobility component. Special attention has been given to the&#13;
enterprise selection process and orientation of voluntary migrants, and an important role has&#13;
been defined for the ACWF in this process. In coordination with local Labor Bureaus, all&#13;
new low-skilled jobs created by project would be filled in large part with women. This&#13;
affirmative action approach would not have negative effects since many sectors, such as&#13;
handicrafts and agroprocessing, tend to have 60 to 80 percent female staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1   Summary. LGPR and its Foreign Capital Project Management Center (FCPMC)&#13;
would have principal responsibility for overall project implementation. At the provincial&#13;
level, Project Leading Groups (PLG) have been set up to (a) mobilize institutional,&#13;
technical and financial resources and support for the preparation and implementation of&#13;
the project, and (b) provide a critical coordination and monitoring function. In addition,&#13;
Project Management Offices (PMO) have been established to ensure effective and timely&#13;
implementation of the project. The complexity of the project requires that FCPMC and&#13;
the provincial PMOs be greatly strengthened. An institutional development program to&#13;
strengthen FCPMC and the provincial PMOs would be implemented as an integral part of&#13;
the project (para. 3.34). At the county level, PLGs and PMOs have also been set up. The&#13;
several county-level technical bureaus directly involved in the project would, in close&#13;
cooperation with the participating township governments and their offices at the&#13;
administrative village level, play a key role in the day-to-day implementation of the&#13;
project. At both the central and provincial levels, Technical Advisory Groups have been&#13;
set up to provide technical support for project implementation. The general organization&#13;
of the project is shown in Chart 1.&#13;
4.2   Central Level. The project is an integral part of the Government's 8-7 Plan, and&#13;
LGPR would be the decision-making body for the project with full responsibility for&#13;
coordinating the various government agencies involved in project implementation.&#13;
4.3   FCPMC would serve as the secretariat for LGPR on all project-related matters,&#13;
and would be responsible for the management of overall project implementation.&#13;
FCPMC would provide guidance and assistance to the PMOs at lower levels in subproject&#13;
selection and appraisal, and would have responsibility for overall project monitoring and&#13;
evaluation.  It would also be directly responsible for the implementation of the&#13;
interprovincial part of the labor mobility component and part of the institutional&#13;
development component of the project. FCPMC's other responsibilities would include:&#13;
arranging combined procurement under ICB and international shopping; reviewing&#13;
applications for withdrawals from the credit and loan proceeds; preparing consolidated&#13;
accounting, auditing and progress reports, including the implementation completion&#13;
report; coordinating institutional development aspects, particularly overseas training,&#13;
study tours and technical assistance; and providing liaison with the Bank Group. During&#13;
the course of SWPRP project preparation, FCPMC was established with bureau-level&#13;
status and approved for 30 professional-level staff positions. An assurance was obtained&#13;
at negotiations that FCPMC would be staffed at levels, and maintained with functions&#13;
and responsibilities, acceptable to the Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
4.4   Two Technical Advisory Groups (TAG) have been set up at the national level to&#13;
provide technical support to LGPR and FCPMC. Comprised of senior staff of the&#13;
Chinese Academy of Sciences, one TAG provides support on key technical issues for&#13;
project preparation and implementation. The other TAG, which is primarily staffed with&#13;
senior consultants with a great deal of experience in the preparation and implementation&#13;
of the Bank Group's projects in China, provides support on detailed technical issues and&#13;
issues related to the organization of project implementation. In addition, at least one staff&#13;
member of a provincial scientific research institution, university or college has been sent&#13;
to each of the 26 project counties to advise on project technical issues. In addition, in&#13;
close collaboration with FCPMC, SSB is directly involved in the design and&#13;
implementation of the project's poverty monitoring subcomponent (paras. 3.36 and 3.37).&#13;
Lastly, FCPMC's existing environmental assessment and monitoring unit (EU) would&#13;
orchestrate the work of the EUs to be established within the provincial PMOs. Prior to&#13;
the provision of funding for individual project TVEs, the provincial EUs would confirm&#13;
that the appropriate EPB has issued full environmental clearances for the proposed&#13;
enterprise.&#13;
4.5   CWHRDC and the provincial PMOs and related Labor Bureaus would manage&#13;
the labor mobility component. CWHRDC would (a) establish a job placement system for&#13;
interprovincial labor mobility, (b) provide provincial and county Labor Bureau staff with&#13;
management training, and (c) have responsibility for completing semiannual labor&#13;
mobility monitoring reports (para. 3.7). A separate consultative body, consisting of&#13;
representatives of the ACWF, the Public Security Bureau, the Ministry of Light Industry,&#13;
and external consultants, would be established to provide independent review of the labor&#13;
mobility component.&#13;
4.6   Provincial Level. PLGs have been established in each of the three project&#13;
provinces. The provincial PLGs are headed by a vice governor in charge of poverty&#13;
reduction and assisted by representatives from the provincial PADO, Planning&#13;
Commission and Finance Bureau, the several technical Bureaus directly involved in the&#13;
project (including the Agriculture, Forestry, Health, Education, Labor and Statistical&#13;
Bureaus), ACWF, and ADBC. The main responsibilities of the PLGs are to formulate&#13;
project-related policies and plans, approve subproject designs, and mobilize institutional,&#13;
technical and financial resources and support for the implementation of the project. The&#13;
PLGs would also provide a critical coordination function.&#13;
4.7   Similar to FCPMC at the central level, PMOs have been set up at the provincial&#13;
level. Under the leadership of the provincial PADOs, the provincial PMOs would&#13;
manage the implementation of the project in their corresponding provinces. The&#13;
provincial PMOs would (a) review feasibility studies prepared by the project counties,&#13;
(b) draw up annual work programs and budgets, (c) review and approve lower-level PMO&#13;
work plans, (d) review and forward disbursement of Bank Group and government funds&#13;
to local government accounts, (e) prepare and submit to the central project office detailed&#13;
project accounts, audits, withdrawal applications and progress reports, (f) arrange&#13;
common procurement, and (g) undertake project monitoring of physical and financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
progress and evaluations of project impact. The provincial PMOs would also directly&#13;
implement the provincial part of the institutional development component and coordinate&#13;
the research program of the land and farmer development component (para. 3.23).&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the provincial PMOs would (a) be staffed&#13;
at levels, and maintained with functions and responsibilities, acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group, and (b) prepare and furnish a detailed annual budget and work plan, including&#13;
training, acceptable to the Bank Group, by December I of each year, for project&#13;
implementation the followingyear.&#13;
4.8  In order to take full advantage of MOL's existing information network and&#13;
nationwide hierarchy of Labor Bureaus, the provincial Labor Bureaus would assist the&#13;
PMOs with the final preparation and the implementation of the labor mobility&#13;
component. Similarly, the provincial Health and Educational Bureaus would also take a&#13;
leading role in the preparation and implementation of the social services programs. For&#13;
the project's other components, the chain of command would directly link the provincial&#13;
PMOs with county-level organizations (instead of going through provincial bureaus) in&#13;
order to ensure adequate coordination at the county level and below. Support from all&#13;
provincial agencies would be secured through the function of the provincial PLGs. To&#13;
provide technical support to the provincial PLGs and PMOs, TAGs comprising experts&#13;
and senior consultants in various fields have also been set up at the provincial level.&#13;
4.9   County Level and Below. PLGs have also been established at both the county&#13;
and township levels in order to fully mobilize existing institutional resources and&#13;
guarantee coordination among various agencies and units. Chaired by the county&#13;
magistrate, the county PLGs would take full responsibility for project implementation in&#13;
their respective county. County PMOs, chaired by deputy county magistrates responsible&#13;
for poverty reduction, have also been set up. The county PMOs function as the&#13;
secretariat for the county PLGs, and serve as the contact with project organizations at&#13;
higher levels. The county PMOs would also be responsible for project monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, financial management, arrangement of common procurement and distribution&#13;
of goods and services procured, and common training components in conjunction with&#13;
line agencies at the county level.&#13;
4.10  County technical bureaus directly involved in the project would, in close&#13;
cooperation with Township Project Work Stations (TPWS) and Village Project Execution&#13;
Groups (VPEG), be responsible for the day-to-day execution of the project in their&#13;
corresponding area. Township Extension Stations would be comprehensive technical&#13;
units integrating crop production, animal husbandry, forestry and other technicians. In&#13;
addition to members of the village committee and the ACWF representative, VPEGs&#13;
would also include at least one household representative. Under the leadership of the&#13;
county PLG and PMO, the Health and Education Bureaus would be responsible for the&#13;
social services programs; the Labor Bureaus for the labor mobility component; the&#13;
Agriculture, Water Resources, Animal Husbandry and Forestry Bureaus for the land and&#13;
farmers development component; and the Power, Transportation, and Industry and&#13;
Commerce Administration Bureaus for the rural infrastructure component. Execution of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
the TVE development component would be the responsibility of the county TVE Bureau&#13;
and several other bureaus with responsibility for rural industry. These implementing&#13;
agencies' responsibilities include planning, financial management, procurement,&#13;
disbursement, quality control, monitoring and evaluation, and encouraging farmers to&#13;
participate in the project. Local nongovernmental organizations, such as ACWF, would&#13;
also be involved in the implementation of the project in activities such as farmers'&#13;
training and monitoring and evaluation. The project would provide the TPWSs and&#13;
VPEGs with a yearly budget of Y 3,600 and Y 480, respectively, to allow project staff to&#13;
carry out frequent follow-up activities for individual village development plans.&#13;
4.11  Various economic entities would be engaged in the implementation of the project.&#13;
In addition to individual project farm households, joint household entities with various&#13;
forms of ownership would be engaged in more commercially oriented agriculture and&#13;
forestry activities, e.g., fruit production. Joint ventures, between farmers and local&#13;
businesses, would also engage in conmmercially oriented production.  For project&#13;
activities in mining, manufacturing, processing and service industries, TVEs with various&#13;
forms of ownership would play a dominant role.&#13;
B. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.12 Flow of Funds. MOF would make the proceeds of the IBRD Loan and IDA&#13;
(ITF) Credit available to the governments of the three project provinces. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that (a) MOF would make the proceeds of the IBRD Loan&#13;
and IDA (ITF) Credit available to the three project provinces at 2 percent interest rate&#13;
per year with a repayment period of 17 years, including a 5 year grace period, and&#13;
(b) the foreign exchange risk would be borne by the provincial governments. A portion&#13;
of the Bank Group funds made available to the provinces would be used directly by the&#13;
provinces to cover the costs of institutional development, research, technical assistance,&#13;
training, equipment, management expenses and labor mobility activities. The provincial&#13;
Finance Departments, representing the provincial governments, would channel the&#13;
remaining funds successively to prefecture, municipal, county and township governments&#13;
through their internal financial system. Onlending to farmers and enterprises would be&#13;
only for activities that have been appraised and approved by the project implementing&#13;
agencies.&#13;
4.13  Reimbursement Procedures. MOF, FCPMC, and the PMO and technical bureau&#13;
staff at all levels would be involved in the preparation and review of reimbursement&#13;
applications. Reimbursement documentation would be prepared by the county PMO and,&#13;
with the review and signature of the county Finance Bureau, be sent to the provincial PMO.&#13;
At the provincial level, the documentation would be reviewed and approved by the&#13;
provincial PMO. With the review and signature of the provincial Finance Bureau, the&#13;
docunentation would then be sent simultaneously to MOF and FCPMC. FCPMC would&#13;
have a five-day review period to comment on, or object to, the documentation (except for&#13;
reimbursement documentation for labor mobility, which could take more than five days).&#13;
MOF would not process the reimbursement application until any FCPMC comments or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50-&#13;
objections were resolved. However, MOF would process the application if it does not&#13;
receive comments from FCPMC within the seven-day review period.&#13;
C. EXECUTION OF PROJECT WORKS&#13;
4.14  Construction of minor works would be undertaken by participating poor farmers or&#13;
contracted out to construction enterprises depending on the component and local&#13;
circumstances. Land development and crop establishment would also be carried out by the&#13;
farmers participating in the project. Work teams from participating villages would be&#13;
organized to carry out labor-intensive works such as terracing and some road construction.&#13;
Larger works, such as large structures for rural infrastructure and larger buildings, would be&#13;
contracted to construction companies. For the labor mobility component, employment&#13;
agencies of various kinds would carry out activities such as collection of employment&#13;
information, market promotion, and training and placement of the laborers. Provision of&#13;
initial training and monitoring of the employment conditions would be the responsibilities&#13;
of CWHRDC, FCPMC, the provincial and county PMOs and Labor Bureaus, and ACWF at&#13;
various levels. The institutional development component and the centralized training and&#13;
technical assistance (TA) activities would be carried out by FCPMC and the provincial&#13;
PMOs.&#13;
4.15  Prior to implementation, the provincial PMOs would further evaluate all the county-&#13;
level project feasibility studies (including representative designs for various types of&#13;
subprojects) to ensure that they are consistent with overall project objectives. Criteria&#13;
designed during appraisal would be followed in the evaluation. Provincial line agencies and&#13;
the TAGs would be mobilized to provide technical inputs in the reviewing process.&#13;
FCPMC would (a) provide overall guidance and undertake a final quality check as part of&#13;
the evaluation, and (b) present a summary of the outcome of the review process to the Bank&#13;
Group before September 1997. Detailed planning and design of subprojects would be&#13;
carried out by the respective implementing agencies and qualified design institutes at&#13;
various levels and reviewed according to domestic procedures. The provincial PMOs&#13;
would review at least two designs for each subproject in each project county. Annual work&#13;
programs and budgets would be prepared based on the detailed designs and sent to the Bank&#13;
Group for review before December 1 of each year. To achieve the necessary flexibility in&#13;
project design and implementation, an assurance was obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
Borrower, through FCPMC, and the project provinces, through their provincial PMOs,&#13;
would prepare for the Bank Group a mid-term report of the project by June 30, 1999.&#13;
D. PROJECT LAUNCH WORKSHOP&#13;
4.16  To organize and initiate project implementation, the Bank Group and FCPMC&#13;
would conduct a Project Launch Workshop in China for staff of the provincial and county&#13;
PMOs and related Bureaus. The purpose of the workshop would be to review the total&#13;
program for implementation and to clarify tasks and responsibilities at each level. Topics&#13;
would include Bank Group guidelines and procedures for procurement and disbursement,&#13;
financial management, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, computerized project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
planning and management, and inspection and acceptance procedures ("yanshou") for&#13;
project works.&#13;
E. MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND REPORTING&#13;
4.17  FCPMC and the provincial and county PMOs would monitor the project's overall&#13;
progress and impact, and evaluate the economic and financial benefits from each&#13;
component. Current accounts of physical and financial process for each component would&#13;
be kept to allow comparisons with management projections. The project's impact on the&#13;
incomes and physical well-being of project farmers would be systematically monitored&#13;
under the project's poverty monitoring component. Special attention would be given to the&#13;
effects of project activities on women. A vision of what a project community would look&#13;
like after project completion, a list of key monitoring indicators for physical progress and&#13;
project expenditures, and a plan for Bank Group supervision are given in Annex 10.&#13;
Reporting information would be submitted by county PMOs to the provincial PMOs, and&#13;
then to FCPMC, which would prepare consolidated semiannual progress reports for&#13;
submission to the Bank Group. In addition to routine reporting, FCPMC and the PMOs&#13;
would undertake on-site supervision at least twice a year. Findings of this on-site&#13;
supervision, including problems identified and corrective actions required, would be&#13;
presented in the semiannual progress reports. Project completion reports would be prepared&#13;
for each component as they are completed. FCPMC would prepare, and submit to the Bank&#13;
Group no later than three months following the closing date, a final implementation&#13;
completion report for the whole project based on the county and provincial completion&#13;
reports.&#13;
4.18  Performance Monitoring. Performance monitoring would include a detailed&#13;
baseline sample survey with annual follow-up surveys, and monitoring by FCPMC and&#13;
the three provincial PMOs of a detailed listing of performance indicators. SWPRP has&#13;
established models for both the survey work and the listing of performance indicators.&#13;
Throughout implementation, the Bank will focus on a subset of about 15 indicators,&#13;
including: inputs-counterpart funding, and staffing of the provincial and lower-level&#13;
PMOs; outputs-elementary school attendance rates, number of treatments provided by&#13;
village level health care funds, number of upland poor placed in off-farm jobs, kilometers&#13;
of rural roads built, land area adopting project agricultural activities, and jobs created in&#13;
project rural enterprises; outcomes-completion rate at sixth-grade level, migrant&#13;
laborers' income levels and remittances, and number of project beneficiaries with&#13;
improved access to safe drinking water; and impact-infant mortality rate, incidence of&#13;
absolute poverty in the project areas, knowledge of and access to off-farm employment,&#13;
and adoption of a focused rural development project approach to poverty reduction in&#13;
nonproject counties. The full list of key monitoring indicators is provided in Annex 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
5. PRODUCTION AND MARKETS&#13;
A. PRODUCTION&#13;
5.1   Incremental production under the project (Table 5.1) would derive from (a) more&#13;
intensive cropping with increased use of modem inputs (such as quality seeds and&#13;
fertilizers) on newly or improved terraced, irrigated and drained land, resulting in more&#13;
stable and increased yields and increased cropping indexes, (b) the introduction of new cash&#13;
crops, (c) the expansion of tree crops planted on underutilized lands and intercropped on&#13;
cultivated land, (d) greater livestock production through an increase in fodder resources, (e)&#13;
the design and extension of appropriate technology packages and the delivery to farmers of&#13;
training, veterinary and processing services, (f) increased labor productivity allowed by the&#13;
construction of rural roads and other infrastructure and the development and provision to&#13;
farmers of small tools, and (g) increased availability of financial resources and improved&#13;
technologies for TVEs.&#13;
5.2   Food and Cash Crops. The project would significantly increase yields and output&#13;
of grain, fodder, and cash crops. Terracing, supplementary irrigation, improved seeds,&#13;
fertilizers, and other inputs, and training and extension programs would be the main&#13;
contributors to the expected yield increases of 35 percent for corn, 40 percent for wheat, 20&#13;
percent for potato, 35 percent for cornstalk fodder, and 90 percent for cut-and-carry fodder.&#13;
These yield increases would more than offset a modest reduction in the area sown to grain&#13;
crops and, at full development, annual incremental output would comprise more than&#13;
70,000 tons of corn, 70,000 tons of wheat, and 190,000 tons of potatoes and sweet potatoes.&#13;
Increased corn production would also bring about a 40 percent increase in cornstalk for&#13;
fodder use-from about 260,000 to 365,000 tons. The project would also support the&#13;
development of more than 25,000 ha of annual cash crops, including medicinal tubers and&#13;
herbs, vegetables and oilseeds.&#13;
5.3   Economic Tree Crops. The project would assist about 16,200 households to plant&#13;
new or rehabilitate existing mulberry on 4,900 ha. Under the project, the quality of silk&#13;
cocoon would be improved and yields would triple-from 300 kg to 1 ton per ha. This&#13;
would be achieved by using improved mulberry graftings, improving household-level&#13;
management and silkworm-raising facilities and tools, and supporting sericulture training&#13;
for farmers. Most project households would take part in the development of a wide variety&#13;
of tree and bush crops on about 24,500 ha of sloped terrain. The introduction of higher-&#13;
quality seedlings, balanced fertilizer applications, supplementary irrigation, and improved&#13;
postharvest practices under the project would greatly increase yields of marketable&#13;
medicinal tree crop products, fruits, and nuts. At full development, annual incremental&#13;
production would include about 12,700 tons of medicinal tree products and resins, 44,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
tons of walnuts and chestnuts, and about 65,400 tons of kiwifruit, pomelo, apple, pear, and&#13;
other fruits.&#13;

(kg)&#13;
LA   Grain comprises wheat, com, rice, other grains and legumes, and potato/sweet potato. Potato and sweet potato are expressed as dry grain equivalent&#13;
(one fifth their wet weight).&#13;
5.4    Forestry and Fodder Development. Household-based timber afforestation would&#13;
take place on underutilized land with an estimated incremental output of about 12,000 cubic&#13;
meters (mi3) of timber. In Ningxia, fuelwood afforestation would help overcome the serious&#13;
shortage of fuel for heating and cooking, and protect the newly terraced land from erosion.&#13;
The newly developed cut-and-carry fodder area of 9,300 ha would yield about 133,000 tons&#13;
of forage annually.&#13;
5.5    Animal Husbandry. The project would support smallholder activities in breeding&#13;
or fattening of an incremental 62,000 cattle, 336,000 goats and sheep, and 312,400 pigs to&#13;
provide income, and organic fertilizer for crops, for nearly two thirds of project households.&#13;
About 70 percent of forage resources are to be produced on farm, including a wide range of&#13;
both local and introduced forage species, and more efficient use of crop residues (para.&#13;
3.18). Improving animal feeding practices-and reducing the winter deficit of feed&#13;
resources in particular-and using improved breeds and feeds, the incremental production&#13;
of beef, pork and mutton would reach about 12,500, 40,000, and 12,750 tons, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
In addition, the project would support the annual incremental production of 50 tons of sheep&#13;
wool or angora wool, nearly 1,000 tons of chicken and duck meat, and 74 tons of eggs.&#13;
5.6   Township and Village Enterprises. Under the project, agroprocessing plants&#13;
would produce about 32,500 tons per year of starch, wheat flour, dried mushrooms and&#13;
amorphophallus, and canned beans. Sixteen upgraded tea factories would process about&#13;
2,200 tons of high-grade teas, and 12 fruit processing plants would produce about 6,400&#13;
tons per year of canned fruit and juices, and dried or processed walnuts and chestnuts.&#13;
Another 35 TVEs would also process or produce 110,000 tons of ginkgo leaves, bamboo,&#13;
galinut and wood, 158,000 square meters of carpets, tapestry, and other products, and 70&#13;
tons of raw silk. Livestock processing plants would produce about 56,000 tons of meat&#13;
products, and feed processing plants would produce 600 tons of feed. In addition, 16 TVEs&#13;
would produce marble, granite, bricks and other construction materials for local sale. The&#13;
21 farmers' markets would provide improved market access to farmers in the project areas.&#13;
B. MARKETS AND PRICES&#13;
5.7   During the past decade, government reforms have greatly liberalized most&#13;
marketing channels. As a result, nearly all agricultural commodities produced under the&#13;
project are now largely deregulated and, at least in part, traded via relatively free markets.&#13;
Project farmers would be able to sell their products to (a) vendors and households at local&#13;
farmers' markets, (b) private traders, (c) agents from government marketing enterprises, and&#13;
(d) local agroprocessing industries.  The reforms have also freed many agricultural&#13;
commodity prices from State control, and increased the procurement prices of those goods&#13;
still subject to State marketing channels. Currently, most agricultural commodity prices in&#13;
the project area reflect market supply and demand and are broadly consistent with world&#13;
market prices.&#13;
5.8   The project would produce a large range of crops across a widely dispersed&#13;
geographic area, and the project's total incremental production of each crop would account&#13;
for only a fraction of total provincial production. Consequently, local demand is expected&#13;
to absorb all of the project's grain, fodder, and timber production, and most of the orchard,&#13;
livestock, and sericulture production. A small balance would be exported to other parts of&#13;
China.&#13;
5.9   Grain and Other Staple Crops. The project area is chronically deficient in the&#13;
production and availability of most basic food crops and products, including grain,&#13;
vegetable oil, and meat, and critically depends on continued government supplies of relief&#13;
grain (para. 2.7). Previous policies have emphasized food self-sufficiency, but have largely&#13;
failed to achieve the desired effect in poor upland counties where farmers attempt to&#13;
produce grain on unsuitably steep and rocky land. Therefore, local demand (for direct&#13;
consumption and for use as animal feed) will more than match the project's incremental&#13;
grain production of about 190,000 tons (or 73 kg per capita in the project area).&#13;
5.10 Cash Crops, Economic Tree Crops and Forest Products. The market prospects&#13;
for project cash crops, economic trees, fuelwood and timber are also favorable since (a) fruit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
and nuts have very high income elasticities of demand, (b) national shifts in the location of&#13;
orchard crops and mulberry favor production in the project areas (since urbanization and&#13;
industrialization continue to increase factor prices for production in coastal areas), (c) the&#13;
project area's climate and soil are well suited to temperate zone nuts, fruits, and medicinal&#13;
herbs and trees, and farmers are skilled in their cultivation as sideline crops, and (d) there is&#13;
a chronic shortage of fodder, timber, and fuelwood in the project area.&#13;
5.11  China produced 776,900 tons of silk cocoon in 1994, and is moving from heavy&#13;
reliance on raw silk exports to processed goods that capture additional value added from&#13;
domestic manufacturing. At present, China's total silk cocoon production accounts for&#13;
about two thirds of the world production, and Sichuan alone, about one fifth. As land and&#13;
labor are becoming more expensive in coastal areas, the increased market shares of silk&#13;
cocoon for inland provinces are consistent with their significant comparative advantage in&#13;
land and labor, and their long tradition of mulberry cocoon production and silk reeling&#13;
(particularly in Sichuan and Shaanxi). Project incremental production, which would&#13;
amount to less than 2 percent of China's current production, would be sold primarily to the&#13;
prefecture- and county-level branch offices of the China National Silk Import and Export&#13;
Corporation (CNSIEC), which in turn would sell most of the product to local silk reeling&#13;
factories.&#13;
5.12  China's chestnut accounted for about 22 percent of the estimated world production,&#13;
about 450,000 tons, in 1995. About 30 to 40 percent of China's production has been&#13;
exported mainly to Japan and other Asian countries. Due to rising domestic demand, the&#13;
average market price for dried chestnuts increased by more than 20 percent annually during&#13;
1986-96. Similarly, walnut has also enjoyed strong market demand. Its oil and fruit are&#13;
nutritious and can be processed into a variety of products, and its wood is highly valued for&#13;
furniture and other uses. Most walnut production would be sold on the domestic market for&#13;
processing, though a small share would be exported. At present, Sichuan and Shaanxi&#13;
produce about 4 percent of China's total chestnut and walnut output, and project production&#13;
would double current output in the two provinces. Although international and domestic&#13;
demand is increasing for both products, further market analysis should be carried out. Tea&#13;
production in the project area would target the high quality and specialty brands end of the&#13;
domestic market. No market difficulties are anticipated for these preferred teas, which are&#13;
currently in short supply. At present, annual world production of ginkgo nuts amounts to&#13;
6,000 tons, of which about 80 percent is produced in China. Given the estimated domestic&#13;
demand of 50,000 tons, all ginkgo nuts produced under the project would be sold on the&#13;
domestic market for fresh consumption and processing. Gingko leaves would be sold on&#13;
the domestic market for medicinal compound extraction, which would in turn be sold in&#13;
both domestic and export markets. Gingko wood, used for high-quality furniture and art&#13;
works, would be sold domestically. Incremental Eucommia production under the project&#13;
would amount to less than 17 percent of the total current production in the two provinces.&#13;
Although total supply is projected to increase quickly enough to reduce real prices over&#13;
time, it would still provide a reasonable margin for local growers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
5.13  A variety of project medicinal or nutritional cash crops would exploit market niches.&#13;
Extracts of Peltate yam-which is best grown in southern Shaanxi-are in high demand as&#13;
key ingredients for many pharmaceuticals. Due to increased export opportunities, the&#13;
domestic market price rose from Y 270,000 per ton in 1992 to Y 480,000 in 1995. Chinese&#13;
goldthread and Gastrodia are widely used traditional Chinese medicines. Project output of&#13;
these products would comprise a very small fraction of the total market. The starch from&#13;
Amorphophallus-used traditionally as a food supplement-has been exploited by both&#13;
domestic and other Asian markets for its nutritional value. Its price climbed from Y 8,000&#13;
per ton in 1992 to Y 13,000 in 1995. About half the project output would be marketed&#13;
domestically, and the other half would be exported to established markets overseas.&#13;
Shaanxi has a long tradition in cultivating edible fungi, which are highly preferred for their&#13;
nutritional and medicinal values. Under the project, farmers would also produce a wide&#13;
range of other cash crops (such as assorted medicinal herbs and vegetables) and tree crops&#13;
(including a wide variety offruits). The incremental production of these products would be&#13;
small, and mainly targeted at local markets. The incremental production of fodder,&#13;
fuelwood, and timber would be marketed within the project areas or consumed on-farm.&#13;
5.14  Livestock Products. Increasing demand for livestock products has accompanied&#13;
rising incomes, and China's livestock subsector has undergone rapid growth during the past&#13;
18 years. By world standards, however, current output levels remain modest when assessed&#13;
on a per capita basis. In the project areas, furthermore, current per capita production of&#13;
meat and eggs is only about half of the national average. Local demand is therefore&#13;
expected to more than match project incremental production of meats and eggs.&#13;
5.15  TVE Outputs. All agroprocessing feasibility studies would include a review of&#13;
commercial viability, and it is expected that incremental production would be absorbed&#13;
without difficulties through existing domestic and export markets. Given the high income&#13;
elasticity of demand for processed fruit, vegetables and meat, expected growth in per capita&#13;
income would lead to increased sales of processed goods from local TVEs. While most&#13;
TVE production will meet local demand, small amounts of fruit, silk and medicinal herbs&#13;
would be exported through existing channels. Construction materials would be largely&#13;
absorbed by strong local demand from the construction industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
6. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
6.1   The project would improve the income levels and well-being of about 2.3 million&#13;
absolute poor. The main project benefits would be (a) increased income levels by&#13;
improving upland agricultural productivity, (b) better access to off-farm employment&#13;
opportunities through the development of TVEs and labor mobility, (c) improved access&#13;
to social and other basic services by increasing access to markets, safe drinking water,&#13;
electric power, education, health and other social services, (d) stabilization and reversal of&#13;
upland environmental destruction through land improvement and natural resource&#13;
conservation works, and (e) improved (i) poverty project design and implementation&#13;
capacity and (ii) poverty monitoring at the project and national levels.&#13;
6.2  Increased Income and Employment. The project would directly increase&#13;
beneficiaries' incomes through (a) increasing production of grain, cash and tree crops and&#13;
livestock, and (b) providing greater opportunity for off-farm employment in local TVEs&#13;
and more distant job markets. Farm productivity increases would derive from the&#13;
combined effect of a variety of specific investments and improved technologies&#13;
implemented through integrated village development programs. Off-farm employment&#13;
opportunities would be provided to about 188,500 upland poor in rural enterprise within&#13;
their counties (33,850 jobs) through the TVE development component, and within&#13;
(36,000 jobs) and outside their provinces (118,700 jobs) through the labor mobility&#13;
component. These jobs would provide annual net incomes per worker of at least Y 900,&#13;
Y 1200, and Y 1800, respectively. In combination with expected increases in on-farm&#13;
family income, it is estimated that average annual per capita income in the project areas&#13;
would double in real terms at full development.&#13;
6.3  Improved Social and Other Basic Services. QEP would directly improve&#13;
primary education for most of the 330,000 school-age children in the project areas.&#13;
Tuition assistance would enable about 34,000 absolutely poor children per year to enroll&#13;
in schools and complete their primary education, leaving about 30,000 children without&#13;
access. Similarly, village health care funds under QHP would greatly augment the&#13;
delivery of basic health services to project area children and adults. It is expected that&#13;
infant mortality rates would be reduced from more than 10 percent at present to less than&#13;
4 percent at full development, and maternal mortality would be reduced by more than 50&#13;
percent. The incidence of endemic diseases, such as iodine deficiency and fluorosis,&#13;
would also be significantly reduced. Gravel roads would link 780 project villages to the&#13;
existing network of county roads. In addition to providing job opportunities to local&#13;
inhabitants, the construction of these rural roads would provide isolated villages much&#13;
improved access to markets, which will encourage and support higher levels of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
agricultural production and marketing. Provision of safe drinking water to some 466,000&#13;
project beneficiaries would reduce the incidence of diarrheal and other water-related&#13;
diseases, and would reduce the time and labor women are required to spend supplying&#13;
water for their families and livestock.&#13;
6.4   Enhanced Beneficiary and Community Participation. From the outset of&#13;
preparation, the project adopted a participatory strategy in which upland farmers helped&#13;
design a menu of options to address their development needs. By emphasizing integrated&#13;
village development and household training, the project would demonstrate and&#13;
strengthen the capacity of village organizations to manage their own resources and&#13;
development activities. The integrated village production system, once established,&#13;
should become a key factor in sustaining land and farmer development. Particular&#13;
attention has also been given to ensuring that women are actively involved in the project&#13;
and derive positive benefits.&#13;
6.5   Environmental Protection. The project would have a positive effect on the&#13;
environment through subproject investments in land terracing works, water storage,&#13;
agroforestry, and other on-farm soil conservation works. Most importantly, project&#13;
households would take part in planting and maintenance of tree, bush and pasture species&#13;
on more than 40,000 ha of steeply sloped hillsides and wastelands. Together, these&#13;
investments would reverse further degradation of the fragile ecosystem, reduce runoff and&#13;
soil loss, and contribute to the rehabilitation of degraded grassland and forest areas.&#13;
B. COST AND RENT RECOVERY&#13;
6.6   Cost recovery for the land and farmer development component would involve&#13;
several elements. The cost of chemical fertilizer, seeds, agrochemicals, animals, feed and&#13;
other agricultural and livestock inputs would be recovered by payments from&#13;
beneficiaries. Some of the costs of research and training would be recovered either by&#13;
fees levied directly on beneficiaries or through taxes paid on project production. Services&#13;
provided by veterinary and other agricultural services support staff would be recovered&#13;
through service fees. The costs for the labor mobility component would be recovered&#13;
through wage deductibles paid by those laborers successfully placed under the project.&#13;
The cost recovery analysis of the representative villages shows that, at present tax rates,&#13;
project charges would be sufficient to cover project costs with a recovery index of 100&#13;
percent.  Rent recovery averages 42 percent at full development and 78 percent&#13;
discounted over the life of the project (Annex9).&#13;
C. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
6.7   Financial and economic analysis for the project was undertaken on the basis of an&#13;
analysis of a representative village program (including labor mobility activities) and&#13;
selected representative TVE subprojects. The village program is representative of the&#13;
mountainous project area of Sichuan and Shaanxi. Financial and economic rates of return&#13;
were estimated for the village program and for individual project activities under the&#13;
program. Farm model analysis was also carried out to assess the financial impact of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
program on the farm households. The selected TVE investments include tea, potato, taro&#13;
and mineral processing subprojects.&#13;
6.8   Financial Analysis. The analysis indicates that the financial rate of return (FRR)&#13;
for the village program is about 38 percent, with FRRs for various activities ranging from&#13;
12 to 67 percent (Ann=.2). The financial return of the village program would provide&#13;
adequate incentives for farmers to adopt the strategies proposed by the project. Farm&#13;
model analysis for the program illustrates that with an average investment of about Y 500&#13;
per person, farmers' per capita annual grain production would increase to about 360 kg at&#13;
full development. During the same period, it is expected that farmers' annual per capita&#13;
net income would double in real terms. The farm model analysis also illustrates that the&#13;
project's village programs would be financially sustainable since, even in the early years&#13;
of the project, net cash income generated by the labor mobility, livestock and cash crop&#13;
activities would be more than enough to meet cash requirements of intensified grain&#13;
production.&#13;
6.9   The financial analysis indicates that the FRR for the labor mobility component is&#13;
about 34 percent, even after assuming a full year postponement of the revenue stream,&#13;
very conservative estimates of the job retention rate (viz., 60 percent by the fourth year of&#13;
employment), and generous living expenses (50 percent of the total wage income). The&#13;
strong FRR is consistent with the extreme wage rate differentials between poor rural&#13;
areas and more prosperous urban and rural areas (para. 2.27). For the TVE component,&#13;
enterprise FRRs range between 22 and 30 percent. These returns would be adequate to&#13;
meet interest and loan repayment obligations and guarantee attractive rates of return to&#13;
equity investors. Sensitivity analysis shows that most FRRs are relatively robust to wide&#13;
changes in input and output prices (Annex9).&#13;
6.10 Economic Analysis. Economic farm-gate prices are calculated for tradable&#13;
commodities and inputs using border prices as reported in the Bank Group's commodity&#13;
price forecasts, adjusted for transportation and marketing margins. For nontradable&#13;
items, financial farm-gate prices were assumed to represent economic prices where&#13;
markets are not regulated. The shadow wage rate for unskilled labor has been estimated&#13;
at Y 6 per day, reflecting high unemployment in the project area. Investment costs are&#13;
expressed in economic values through the application of conversion factors.  All&#13;
economic values are converted to local currency at the prevailing official exchange rate of&#13;
Y 8.3.&#13;
6.11  The projectwide economic analysis excludes the education, health, rural&#13;
infrastructure, institution building and poverty monitoring activities because it is&#13;
impractical to quantify their benefits. However, these activities are essential to the long-&#13;
term success and sustainability of the project and no doubt have very high economic and&#13;
social returns. Estimated economic rates of return (ERRs) for the project's other&#13;
activities are about 43 percent for the village program, 43 percent for the labor mobility&#13;
component, and 47 to 71 percent for the subprojects under the TVE development&#13;
component. For the project as a whole, the ERR is estimated to be at least 40 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
Sensitivity analysis indicates that the ERRs are relatively robust to wide changes in input&#13;
and output prices (Arn&amp;2).&#13;
D. RisKs&#13;
6.12  Complexity. The project addresses problems of chronic absolute poverty and&#13;
natural resource degradation in an area where previous single-sector interventions have&#13;
not led to sustainable reductions in poverty. The greatest strength of the project-its&#13;
focused multisectoral rural development approach-comes at the inherent cost of greater&#13;
than average complexity and greater difficulties in implementation. This risk was&#13;
acknowledged prior to the outset of project preparation, and has been effectively&#13;
countered by (a) the project's unique organizational and management structure, (b) a&#13;
strong institution and implementation capacity building program, and (c) the full&#13;
involvement of the beneficiaries and village communities in the design and&#13;
implementation of the project. In addition, the project relies on an integrated package of&#13;
proven technologies and interventions. County-level governments, where leadership&#13;
required for effective implementation is more sustainable due to the local importance of&#13;
the project, have extensive experience with these technologies and interventions.&#13;
Successful implementation of SWPRP during 1995-96 appears to have confirmed that&#13;
this unique organizational and management structure can overcome the concerns of above&#13;
average complexity and implementation capacity requirements.&#13;
6.13  Component-Specific Risks.  The individual project components also have&#13;
specific associated risks. For the land and farmer development component, there is a risk&#13;
of slower-than-expected adoption of improved farming practices, resulting in slower&#13;
realization of economic and environmental benefits. However, the improved techniques&#13;
would (a) be integrated with existing local farming practices, (b) require limited material&#13;
inputs, and (c) be introduced, in some cases, on a pilot basis. The project's emphasis on&#13;
strengthening the extension service through technical assistance and provision of required&#13;
subject-matter specialists, and training of farmer-technicians and demonstration&#13;
households is also designed to minimize these risks. The project's participatory approach&#13;
is designed to gain the trust and involvement of beneficiaries and to generate a sense of&#13;
ownership in project activities. There are significant market risks for several of the cash&#13;
and economic tree crops, but these risks are considered to be acceptable (paras. 5.10-&#13;
5.13). Several activities (such as terracing, etc.) under the land and farmer development&#13;
component would directly mitigate the risks of drought.&#13;
6.14 The labor mobility and TVE components face the risks of weak monitoring of&#13;
worker conditions and sudden changes in market conditions. CWHRDC, which has&#13;
already established a highly effective monitoring system, would work with LGPR, the&#13;
provincial Labor Bureaus and ACWF to monitor and evaluate labor mobility activities.&#13;
A pilot-phase evaluation would also identify operational issues, and make necessary&#13;
adjustments. The diversified portfolio of small-scale TVEs has been developed with&#13;
attention to commercial viability. While specific TVEs face higher demand and price&#13;

fluctuations (notably silk reeling and tea processing), the majority of products are&#13;
intended for use in growing local and provincial markets.&#13;
6.15  Sustainability. The conception and preparation of this project have benefited from&#13;
a high degree of Government commitment and from LGPR's experience with the&#13;
Government's poverty reduction efforts since 1985. Project planning and implementation&#13;
capacity of FCPMC and the PADOs in the project areas would be strengthened through the&#13;
institution-building component, which would also attach great importance to project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. The sustainability of the project would depend heavily on the&#13;
full participation of rural communities, including the integration of women in project&#13;
activities. By promoting and strengthening village-level organizations, putting more&#13;
emphasis on grassroots participation, and building local PADOs' project implementation&#13;
capacity, the project is expected to ensure sustainability. To assess progress toward&#13;
implementation, not only information from project monitoring and evaluation would be&#13;
used, but also the comprehensive poverty monitoring reviews organized by SSB using&#13;
annual surveys.&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
Rural Infrastructure Component&#13;
Background&#13;
1.     The Qinba Mountains and the Loess Plateau are two of the regions in which the&#13;
present 58 million absolute poor in China are distributed. The former includes the two&#13;
roughly parallel mountain ranges of Qinling and Dabashan within which are located the 12&#13;
project counties in Sichuan and 10 project counties in Shaanxi, while the four project&#13;
counties in Ningxia are situated in the western part of the Loess Plateau.&#13;
2.     Lofty mountains, with frequent rock outcrops and dissected by numerous deep&#13;
valleys, characterize the Qinba Mountains project area, and the rugged terrain is one of&#13;
considerable precipitousness. Arable land is scarce. A large part of the annual moderate to&#13;
high rainfall (700-1,600 mm) is concentrated in the months of June-September, and gives rise&#13;
to severe soil erosion. The Loess Plateau, on the other hand, is characterized by low annual&#13;
rainfall, low temperature and a short frost-free period, which all adversely affect crop yields.&#13;
In this ecologically degraded and resource-deficient environment, grain production often fails&#13;
to reach the level of subsistence requirements. This situation is exacerbated by inadequate or&#13;
complete absence of rural infrastructure such as water supply, road, electricity, and irrigation&#13;
facilities, as is the case for many remote and isolated villages in the project area: about 47%&#13;
of administrative villages are still not connected to the existing network of roads, 16% of&#13;
administrative villages are still not served by any form of electricity supply, and 30% of the&#13;
population have no access to safe drinking water. Less than 10% of cultivated land is&#13;
irrigated for stabilized grain production. The absence of basic facilities makes living&#13;
conditions harsh and arduous. To reach the nearest water source the villagers have to cover&#13;
long distances by foot and labour through steep terrains, and the nearest dirt roads are&#13;
reached only after some kilometers of steep climb and descent by jungle tracks.&#13;
Considerable labor and effort are thus expended by villagers to bring what small amount of&#13;
forest or agricultural products they produce to the nearest farmers' market. Furthermore,&#13;
there are only very limited means of obtaining help from the outside world in the event of an&#13;
emergency.&#13;
Component Description&#13;
3.     The rural infrastructure component forms an integral part of the multisectoral&#13;
developmental approach to attacking rural poverty and is formulated with the view to&#13;
ameliorating living conditions in the hitherto remote and isolated villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
Targets&#13;
4.     The specific targets for the rural infrastructure component would be to increase the&#13;
rural road coverage at the administrative village level to 80%; to extend potable water&#13;
facilities to cover about 90% of the population in the project area; to provide rural electricity&#13;
to meet the requirements of agroprocessing, mining and other industries in the project area;&#13;
and to construct irrigation and land reclamation works for about 13,900 ha of paddy and&#13;
upland crops.&#13;
Rural Roads&#13;
5.     To extend the coverage of rural roads in the project area, 892 km of all- weather&#13;
gravel roads would be provided, linking 780 administrative villages to the existing network&#13;
of county roads. Selection criteria would include: (i) roads which would serve a number of&#13;
villages with a sizable population, and (ii) roads which would serve areas with farmers'&#13;
markets, rural enterprises, and a concentration of project activities where sufficient&#13;
generation of traffic volume is expected. The roads would be constructed to Class IV road&#13;
standards, with the following minimum technical requirements:-&#13;
Design speed                          20 km/hr&#13;
Width of formation                    4.5 m&#13;
Width of carriageway                  3.5 m&#13;
Radius of road                        15 m&#13;
Stopping sight distance               20 m&#13;
Maximum grade                         11%&#13;
Minimum depth of roadside drain       0.6 m&#13;
Design Load for bridges/culverts      10 t&#13;
Rural Water Supply&#13;
6.     The rural water supply subcomponent would provide safe drinking water to 466,000&#13;
persons in 1,680 villages. Selection criteria would include: (i) villages suffering from&#13;
seasonal water shortages exceeding 60 days in duration, (ii) villages where the water source&#13;
is more than one km away or where the elevation difference between the water source and the&#13;
place where the inhabitants reside is more than 100 m; and (iii) villages where the existing&#13;
water source is unacceptable, such as water sources containing a high level of fluoride and&#13;
villages susceptible to epidemic and endemic diseases.&#13;
7.     Water supply systems would be low-cost. Systems would be designed for daily&#13;
consumption of 15 to 35 liters per person and would meet current water quality standards for&#13;
rural water supply in China. Facilities would tap from springs, utilize ground water, divert or&#13;
pump from streams and would include piped systems with public hydrants, rain collectors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
serving individual households or several households, and shallow wells. Water storages&#13;
would be provided to sustain supply up to 60-70 days in Sichuan and Shaanxi and 100 days&#13;
in Ningxia in the dry seasons. Shallow wells would be equipped with hand pumps to prevent&#13;
contamination. Where sources of supply are adequate and marginal cost within reasonable&#13;
limits, the facilities would also allow for drinking water for animals.&#13;
Rural Energy&#13;
8.     Seventy five km of 35 kV and 669 km of 10 kV overhead transmission and&#13;
distribution lines and eight mini-hydro power plants with an aggregate installed capacity of&#13;
2.2 MW would be installed to increase power supply to the project area. Power facilities&#13;
would meet primarily the requirements of agroprocessing plant and light industries financed&#13;
under the project, the needs of other non-project enterprises in the project area, and the&#13;
domestic requirements in villages located in the vicinity of power lines. About 116,000&#13;
households in 786 villages would be served by the project rural electrification schemes.&#13;
Technical criteria for selection of mini-hydro schemes would include (i) good hydraulic head&#13;
and dependable run-of-river flow; (ii) short distribution lines from plant to demand centres;&#13;
(iii) for stand-alone plants (that is, plants not connected to the power grid), compatibility of&#13;
characteristics of demand load and power generated. Electrical works would conform to&#13;
national technical standards currently in force.&#13;
9.    In some areas of Sichuan Province where there is a chronic shortage of fuelwood due&#13;
to land degradation and progressive depletion of vegetation and where forest is closed to&#13;
further exploitation, biogas digesters as a practical means of providing an alternate source of&#13;
energy would be provided. The rural energy subcomponent would include the installation of&#13;
1,828 units of biogas digesters.&#13;
Water Conservancy Works&#13;
10. A variety of small-scale irrigation works would be constructed in Sichuan and Shaanxi&#13;
to provide supplemental irrigation for about 8,900 ha of existing and new paddy and upland&#13;
crops. The proposed works would include one small reservoir storage scheme, 530 irrigation&#13;
ponds, seven pumping stations, 965 on- farm water cisterns, 43 diversion weirs and 640 km&#13;
of lined canals. In addition, the project would provide, in the semi-arid area in Ningxia,&#13;
individual household operated microirrigation systems with supplies drawn from wells and&#13;
small cisterns. 15 tube wells, 2,000 shallow wells and 21,600 cisterns for rain harvesting&#13;
would be constructed to serve about 4,300 ha. Some 650 ha river beach land would also be&#13;
reclaimed in Ningxia for crop production.&#13;
11. Schemes would be designed to meet irrigation requirements in three out of four years.&#13;
For storage schemes, runoff coefficients used for computing inflow should be based on&#13;
reliable data. Availability of ground water for shallow well and tube well microirrigation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex2&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
should be confirmed, and care taken to prevent over-exploitation. In canal schemes, offtakes&#13;
with simple flow measuring devices such as the "V-notch" would be provided for proper&#13;
water control and delivery at the farm level.&#13;
Preparation and Review of Schemes&#13;
12.  Proposals for the rural infrastructure schemes have been compiled by the three&#13;
provincial PMOs on the basis of submissions by county Water Conservancy and Electric&#13;
Power Bureaus (for water conservancy, rural water supply and rural electrification schemes),&#13;
county Electricity Supply Bureaus (for rural electricity schemes in Shaanxi) and county&#13;
Communication Bureaus for rural road schemes). The great majority of the schemes&#13;
proposed require further preparation and review prior to implementation. In order to insure&#13;
that each scheme proposed for implementation under the project is technically feasible and&#13;
economically viable, and that engineering designs for these are prepared to a uniformly high&#13;
standard, provincial PMOs should ensure that schemes prepared by county technical bureaus&#13;
are reviewed and approved for implementation. Project schemes should conform to the&#13;
selection criteria and technical standards.  Rural road, rural electrification and water&#13;
conservancy schemes should have a minimum estimated economic rate of return of 10%, and&#13;
unit investment costs for individual rural water supply schemes should not exceed RMB&#13;
Y350 per capita including contingencies. All dams rehabilitated under the project would be&#13;
maintained and inspected annually in accordance with sound engineering practices, under&#13;
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank Group.&#13;
Operation and Maintenance&#13;
13.  Adequate arrangements would be made for the operation and maintenance of rural&#13;
infrastructure schemes completed under the project to ensure that the facilities remain in&#13;
good serviceable conditions during the project implementation period and thereafter.&#13;
14.   Rural roads constructed to Class IV road standards and certified as such by&#13;
Communication Bureaus would either be included in the county annual road maintenance&#13;
programmes or be placed under the charge of township Communication Stations concerned.&#13;
In the latter case an annual routine maintenance subsidy would be granted by Communication&#13;
Bureaus with beneficiary villagers providing duty labour for periodical or major repair work.&#13;
15. Village committees would be responsible for organizing operation and maintenance of&#13;
rural water supply systems with full village participation. Normal upkeep and major repair of&#13;
the completed facilities, operation for daily water supply and water rationing in times of&#13;
shortage would be discussed by beneficiary villagers prior to implementation. Management&#13;
committees would be formed and persons appointed to be responsible for looking after the&#13;
facilities. A water fee would be collected either in cash or in kind to cover full operation and&#13;
maintenance costs. Villagers would contribute duty labour for major repair work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
16.   Rural electrification schemes, completed according to technical standards and&#13;
specifications, would be turned over to county Electric Power Companies. These electric&#13;
power companies operate as independent enterprises and would recover full costs including&#13;
costs of operation and maintenance, major repair and capital recovery through tariffs for&#13;
electricity supply.&#13;
17. Operation and maintenance of the water conservancy works completed under the project&#13;
would be arranged by county Water Conservancy Bureaus.  A water fee would be&#13;
progressively increased to recover full operation and maintenance cost.&#13;

Land and Farmer Development Component&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Land and Farmer Development. The common name of the agricultural components of&#13;
the Qinba and Southwest Poverty Reduction Projects underlines their common overall&#13;
objective. The project helps households in the project villages to create and maintain a&#13;
substantial increase in their agricultural incomes, through integrated improvements in land&#13;
use systems. The approach in both projects is (a) to ensure the targeting of the poor by&#13;
geographically concentrating the agricultural investment in project villages, (b) to integrate at&#13;
the administrative village level various development activities which government agencies&#13;
are experienced in, and (c) to improve poor farmers' access to markets and services.&#13;
2.    New Features in the Oinba Design. For the Qinba project, the SWPRP component&#13;
design has been refined in three areas: (a) a strategy for land use improvement has been&#13;
defined for Sichuan and Shaanxi mountains, and for Ningxia (paragraphs 2.8-2.10 in the&#13;
main report), (b) the component would be implemented in the form of individual village&#13;
development plans; these plans are not only planning tools which improve household&#13;
targeting, but also a set of community activities to support the agricultural development&#13;
process, and (c) an action plan has been set up to improve the design and delivery of&#13;
agricultural technology packages.&#13;
Improvement of Land Use Systems&#13;
3.    Strategy. The Qinba land use strategy for poor mountain households is based on three&#13;
principles.  First, the project does not design improved land use systems, but helps&#13;
households improve their own systems. Agricultural land use throughout the project area is&#13;
already centered around intensively managed terraces. As a result, the project's strategy is&#13;
based on expanding terraces. The investment includes terracing costs and one year of crop&#13;
production inputs. The integration of crops, trees and animals is also an existing feature in&#13;
land use. The project aims at enhancing current integration patterns. Second, small-scale&#13;
schemes, whether terracing, fodder development or tree plantations, would make better use of&#13;
soil and climate micro-level diversity, and generally increase the efficiency of household&#13;
labor. Households would be the main decision-makers for the location of these works, and&#13;
large scale ones would be avoided. Third, the strategy aims at reversing environmental&#13;
degradation trends on slopes.&#13;
4.    Expansion of Terraces in Sichuan and Shaanxi Mountains. Building stone-walled&#13;
terraces has long been recognized in project villages as a labor-intensive but low external-&#13;
input intensification means. With labor and soil fertility concentrated on terraces close to&#13;
houses, the productivity of both land and labor is boosted. Grain crop yields become more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
stable. Two or three crops are relayed-cropped every year instead of a single crop on slopes.&#13;
In addition, trees are interplanted on terrace edges, while more fodder is obtained from crop&#13;
residues. However, households need financial support to pay for skilled local workers for the&#13;
stone works, dynamite, cement and tools. Government organizational support is also useful,&#13;
since the amount of manual labor (more than 800 days per hectare) is often supplied through&#13;
large-scale labor exchange among farmers.&#13;
5.    Expansion of Terraces in Ningxia. In areas with more than 400 mm of annual&#13;
rainfall, terrace expansion is key to the proposed increase of corn in cropping patterns (and of&#13;
other high biomass-producing crops such as sorghum). Since it takes about 5 years for the&#13;
organic matter content to build up, corn would at first replace potatoes and other summer&#13;
crops on older terraces, while summer crops less demanding than corn would be grown on&#13;
new terraces. Water-harvesting cisterns will be built on part of the terraces. This will ensure&#13;
a more stable corn output, and may allow some farmers to shift to micro-irrigated cash crops.&#13;
During the last two decades, few terraces had been built in the project villages due to&#13;
insufficient labor (manual terracing can only take place after harvest and before the beginning&#13;
of in-depth soil frost). Mechanization now offers a new opportunity to expand terraces.&#13;
Actual construction works will be carried out in accordance with the precise specifications of&#13;
the Three "Xi" Commission (that is, the Sanxi Commission). Terraces would be completely&#13;
leveled. The more fertile topsoil would be preserved and put back into place. In the semi-&#13;
arid areas below 400 mm of rainfall, land development consists of building microirrigation&#13;
cisterns and wells. Small areas of flatland will be mechanically leveled and plowed.&#13;
6.    Slope Land Use in Sichuan and Shaanxi Mountains. The expansion of terraces would&#13;
reduce corn cultivation on steep slopes (which is often done by bush fallowing). Bush&#13;
fallowing is a non sustainable practice at 330 of North latitude, because of slow vegetation&#13;
growth during fallow, which farmers only retain when they have no other option for food&#13;
production. The reduction of cultivation on steeply sloped land would release a substantial&#13;
amount of household labor for more productive activities, and have a substantial positive&#13;
impact on the environment. The erosion hazards created by cultivation of steeply sloped&#13;
fields would be reduced. Encroachment on the forested area would be halted in a region&#13;
where timber has an important economic potential, and where current encroachment&#13;
particularly impacts the valuable spontaneous oak forest. Moreover, the project area in the&#13;
Qinling mountains surrounds several national protected forest areas (supported under World&#13;
Bank's Forestry Resource Development and Protection Project). As a result, some 30&#13;
hectares of abandoned fallows will grow on average in each project village, and form a mixed&#13;
grass and bush vegetation cover adequate for goat and cow grazing. This is equivalent to 10-&#13;
15% of the present grazing area. As far as tree crop development is concerned, the project&#13;
would develop an average 12 ha per administrative village. Two to four ha would consist in&#13;
mulberry and fruit trees in Sichuan, mostly planted on terrace edges. The remaining 8-10 ha&#13;
is a small area compared to the 150-200 ha of forest land awaiting afforestation and the 20-40&#13;
ha of barren individual wasteland. It would be planted on slopes on either type of land.&#13;
Finally, the development of cash crops on steep slopes (particularly those previously planted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex-3&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
to food crops) would be avoided. Tuber crops such as yam would be specifically located on&#13;
mild slopes. No processing facilities for commercial corn are funded under the project.&#13;
7.    Slope Land Use in Ningxia. Project area sloped land bears the combined pressure of&#13;
population increase which leads to the expansion of the wheat area, and of the rapid increase&#13;
of the goat and sheep population. Goat and sheep numbers have doubled since 1980, while&#13;
wheat has increased from one third to some 40% of the cropped area. The resulting&#13;
overgrazing is a factor triggering gully erosion in watershed heads, and creates annual feed&#13;
deficits in early spring. It will be difficult to reduce the current pressure on grasslands. First,&#13;
the expansion of terraces would not directly reduce slope cultivation. Intensive cash and&#13;
fodder crops would be developed on terraces, but the extensive cultivation of wheat would&#13;
only decline very gradually. Second, a 90% increase in goats and sheep raised by project&#13;
households is planned under the project. This is necessary to create herds of adequate size,&#13;
so that households derive cash income from animal sales on years of wheat crop failure while&#13;
retaining breeding animals for reproduction. A large-scale accompanying resettlement&#13;
program would partly compensate this expansion of animal numbers (the resettlement&#13;
program is not supported by the project). One third of the population of project villages is&#13;
planned to resettle between 1998 and 2001 to the Hongshibao irrigated area which is&#13;
currently under construction. Nevertheless, the overall animal pressure on grasslands would&#13;
still increase, whereas the reduction of grazing intensity is a prerequisite to improved&#13;
grassland management. Neither the allocation of grassland use rights to individual villages in&#13;
1986, nor the support of rotational grazing and other improvement measures by county&#13;
grassland stations have shown substantial impact on grassland rehabilitation in the current&#13;
context of excessive animal pressure. Reducing the grazing pressure would only be achieved&#13;
after households, in addition to devoting more fertile land to alfalfa, have adopted both corn&#13;
cultivation and in-shed feeding of sheep and goats.&#13;
8.    Fodder Development. Fodder resource balances have been carefully reviewed during&#13;
preparation in order to (a) prioritize fodder development actions, and (b) locate fodder deficit&#13;
problems. At full project development, pigs will consume 55% of overall fodder resources in&#13;
Sichuan, while cows will be the larger consumers in Shaanxi and even in Ningxia, where&#13;
they will consume some 50% of the resource. Fifty to 75 percent of the incremental fodder&#13;
needs would be fulfilled by straw and other grain by-products, 10 to 20% being brought by&#13;
straw ammoniation. In Ningxia, the key to maintaining fodder balance is, again, the&#13;
sustained adoption of corn production, and of corn stalk ammoniation. Expanded and&#13;
improved cultivation of alfalfa is expected to contribute equally with improved grassland&#13;
management, but these would altogether provide only 25% of incremental needs. In Sichuan&#13;
and Shaanxi, the increased use of straw (based on improved storage and simple chopping&#13;
tools) would make the main contribution to fodder resource development, followed by the&#13;
yield increases resulting from the adoption of hybrid corn varieties and of virus-free potato&#13;
seed. Both provinces would also need to extend cut-and-carry artificial pasture, and related&#13;
hay storage. Such technology has already been successfully developed but has remained on a&#13;
small scale. Through these various actions, the fodder resource surplus at full project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
development would remain stable compared to the present situation in Shaanxi, and decrease&#13;
but remain positive in Sichuan and Ningxia. However, current surplus margins in fodder&#13;
balances at the provincial level are assessed to be only 30%, 20% and less than 5%,&#13;
respectively in Shaanxi, Sichuan and Ningxia. This calls for careful implementation of&#13;
fodder development plans, and for activities focused on deficit areas. Neighboring villages&#13;
have highly variable fodder resources, and carrying out village resource surveys to assess the&#13;
fodder balance is not feasible since the fodder systems are too complex. These systems&#13;
include a range of by-products, and plots are scattered in a mountainous environment. As a&#13;
result, village conmmunities themselves might be in the best position to assess the optimum&#13;
numbers of animals they could raise (paragraph 13).&#13;
9.    Tree Crop Development. In Ningxia, an agroforestry design (tested by Beijing&#13;
Forestry University in Xiji county) would be extended. Terrace walls would be milder&#13;
gradient slopes, and would be planted with 2 rows of bushes and 1 row of trees. Households&#13;
would manage personally the perennials planted on the side of their individual terraces. This&#13;
would help solve the problem of non-sustainable collective management of fuelwood&#13;
plantations. In the semi-arid areas in Ningxia, newly micro-irrigated areas would be&#13;
surrounded by a network of mixed bush and tree hedges to create an oasis effect. Orchard&#13;
development would be limited to Haiyuan county which is getting involved in the fruit&#13;
market. In the Sichuan and Shaanxi mountains, the direct increase of tree crops in land use&#13;
would be modest, but significant indirect improvements might result from the village-based&#13;
nurseries, household training in practical skills, and township training in participatory&#13;
forestry planning supported by the project. In the present situation, households tend to&#13;
concentrate tree planting on fertile terraces even for forestry species, putting their food crop&#13;
balance at risk over the medium term. The project would both extend interplanting schemes&#13;
with reasonably low densities, and give households increased confidence to plant trees on&#13;
slopes.  During the project, close collaboration with the on-going Yangtze watershed&#13;
reforestation program would be sought. Village development plans would carefully balance&#13;
forestry with animal husbandry development. Village consultation would be a prerequisite to&#13;
any operation of forestry aerial sowing. Poor households would be given equal opportunity&#13;
in contract awards of new timber plantations.&#13;
Village Development Plans&#13;
10.   Targeting Tools. The project will allocate a total agriculture investment budget to&#13;
each administrative village. The average agriculture investment per capita is consistent with&#13;
the provincial average of Y 490, 430 and 790 respectively in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Ningxia&#13;
(in base cost, minus training, extension and services). The plan format is basic, with one&#13;
table for numbers of households and scale of activities, one map showing natural villages and&#13;
the location of activities, and one page of description of activities. This simple format has&#13;
several advantages. First, it draws attention to numbers of beneficiary households, and to&#13;
equity in the distribution of activities among natural villages, an important factor due to&#13;
income differentials between neighboring natural villages. Second, in most townships,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
project staff have been able to master this planning tool after initial training, and have taken&#13;
part in the design of plans (there are 5 to 10 administrative villages per township). Third,&#13;
maps and tables of on-going activities are openly posted at township project office, allowing&#13;
some public control. Finally, counties can easily assemble all planned and completed&#13;
village-level data. As a result, administrative village data is accessible to counties and upper&#13;
levels. This is an improvement compared to the traditional pyramidal reporting structure in&#13;
which each administrative level only obtains data from the immediate lower level.&#13;
11.  Investment Distribution to Individual Households. There is an investment ceiling of&#13;
twice the average investment for the total investment of participating households. All&#13;
households may take part in the agricultural investment if they are willing to, within this&#13;
ceiling and within the framework of the development plan. The actual investment of&#13;
individual households is best determined by their demand.&#13;
12.   Participatory Agricultural Development. Past government programs have advocated a&#13;
trickle-down approach, in which support is concentrated on a small number of focus villages&#13;
and farmers, often better-off ones.  In contrast, village development plans will be&#13;
implemented in each of the 2,941 project villages. They address the entire village population&#13;
in its social and gender diversity, both at collective and individual level. This should create a&#13;
positive dynamic and trigger farmers' capacity to take initiatives in their farming activities. A&#13;
variety of actions have been taken to enhance this positive dynamic. In addition, agricultural&#13;
extension workers would pay regular visits to each village during project implementation,&#13;
and more than half of households would take part in the agriculture component's training&#13;
activities. Finally, the potential for initiative taking of the few better-off, better-educated&#13;
households would be tapped. This category of farmers is a distinctive feature of Sichuan and&#13;
Shaanxi mountain villages. These farmers will have access to loans to develop service&#13;
activities within the village. Various types services have been identified so far, ranging from&#13;
tree nurseries to animal breeding or feed grinding.&#13;
13.   Community Resource Management. The component's land use strategy would require&#13;
a resource management approach, in which project staff would help village communities&#13;
improve the spatial distribution and balance of terraces, trees, fodder production and water&#13;
resources. Unfortunately, this approach would necessitate a level of outside technical support&#13;
incompatible with the large number of project villages, particularly in the complex mountain&#13;
environments in Sichuan and Shaanxi. The approach would be only tested in a few villages&#13;
under the AATP. Except for these villages, village communities would be the main&#13;
designers of their land use improvements (the only exceptions will be mechanized terracing&#13;
in Ningxia, and larger-scale paddy drainage works in the Sichuan hills). Project staff would&#13;
give villages some support to help prevent conflicts on resource use among households, and&#13;
avoid technically inadequate choices. For example, Ningxia villages would be asked to hold&#13;
annual meetings to decide how many animals their current fodder resources allow them to&#13;
purchase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

14.   Quality of Implementation. The implementation of village development plans will be&#13;
monitored by county and province project staff. Monitoring will consist of identifying and&#13;
addressing problems not only in household targeting (as is being done in SWPRP), but also&#13;
in the various aspects of village-level project work described above. Two monitoring tools&#13;
have been prepared. One county table shows completed total investment, subproject scale&#13;
and number of beneficiaries for each village, and sets of minimum quality requirements&#13;
would be used as checklists (see Attachment L to this Annex).&#13;
Agricultural Technology&#13;
15.   Selection of Technical Packages.  The identification of best-practice agricultural&#13;
technology faces important problems which reflect the lack of focus of research and&#13;
extension on mountain areas. First, basic data is often lacking. For exarnple, soils in the&#13;
Daba mountains are considered to be deficient in potassium in Sichuan but not in Shaanxi.&#13;
Interactions between traditional farming practices and the use of external agricultural inputs&#13;
are not well understood. In particular, crop and tree cultivars adapted to higher elevations&#13;
need to be further identified. Second, counties do design some appropriate technology, but&#13;
little exchange takes place between counties. The land and farmer development component&#13;
would use the following approach to address these problems: (a) all technical activities under&#13;
the component would focus on key technical issues; these issues are key ones both for the&#13;
technical viability of the investment and for the overall improvement of farming practices;&#13;
(b) counties' technical bureaus have designed their own technical specifications with the&#13;
support of provincial technical groups; (c) the component supports household-based&#13;
agricultural extension and on-farm applied research; extension agents and researchers would&#13;
not only provide technical back-up to villages, but also transfer back to the extension system&#13;
information useful to refine the technical recommnendations; (d) the adjustment of the initial&#13;
technical specifications would be organized regularly during the project, on the basis of&#13;
implementation results and of applied research outcomes.  Provinces are preparing&#13;
implementation quality requirements regarding each of these steps, as well as the quality of&#13;
works and agricultural inputs. (Attachment 1).&#13;
16.   Key Technical Issues. Five technical issues need further consideration for the three&#13;
provinces:&#13;
* increasing and sustaining soil fertilita on newly developed land. Only one year of&#13;
agricultural inputs is provided for new terraces. Successful development will&#13;
depend on a range of interventions, including organic fertilizer use or crop&#13;
rotations, during several years. Besides, improved seeds can only be used on the&#13;
first year after terrace construction if soil fertility is rapidly enhanced.&#13;
* developing winter fodder resources. Solving the winter fodder gap would not only&#13;
improve the condition of the reproductive and draft animals, but also develop the&#13;
more profitable winter and spring animal sales. The technical support system&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
- 86-&#13;
would shift its focus from veterinary and breeding to animal feeding, and from a&#13;
single innovation, straw ammoniation, to a range of improvements.&#13;
improving the quality of seeds, seedlings and animals. This includes strengthening&#13;
quality control of the inputs supplied by the project, refining recommendations on&#13;
varieties and breeds, and improving the quality of the seed production, tree nursery&#13;
and animal breeding services funded under the project.&#13;
* ensuring successful tree establishment. Technical packages from soil preparation&#13;
to post-planting management would not aim at shortening the number of years&#13;
before first harvest, but would ensure successful establishment and long-term&#13;
sustainability of yields.&#13;
*  ensuring the marketing viability of cash and tree crop products. Varieties need to&#13;
be selected and updated in accordance to market needs. Technical support services&#13;
would be extended to post-harvest, including on-farm storage, packaging, and&#13;
primary processing for some products as tea.&#13;
17.   Unit Cost Table. One unit cost table has been prepared jointly with each provincial&#13;
PMOs for each of its subprojects. The tables detail annual quantities of inputs and specify&#13;
purchased inputs and on-farm produced ones. These tables outline several important&#13;
recommendations: (a) inputs would be always provided in the form of complete technical&#13;
packages, (b) nitrogen and phosphate (and potassium in Sichuan) fertilizers would be applied&#13;
in balanced quantities; fertilizers would be supplied every year until the first year of harvest;&#13;
more would be applied at planting time than during pre-harvest years for tree crops; organic&#13;
fertilizer applications should not decrease following the increased use of chemical fertilizer;&#13;
(c) tree densities would be reduced, but additional plantings would take place on the second&#13;
year to actually reach these densities; (d) pesticides would be made available, but their use&#13;
would remain carefully limited, (e) balanced animal feed would be recommended, including&#13;
grain-by product, protein feed and minerals; the first three products would be primarily self-&#13;
produced, (f) animal sheds would be built by households using simple material, or existing&#13;
sheds would be used, and (g) each unit cost sets aside a small portion of the investment for&#13;
basic farn tools.&#13;
18.   Small Farming Tools. The investment in tools is very small, but it could play an&#13;
important role in the improvement of farming practices. First, households do lack tools. In&#13;
Ningxia, harrows are still made of woven branches, and no yoke is used to harness pairs of&#13;
draft cattle. In the Sichuan mountains, a household may possess as little as one hoe and one&#13;
knife for all farm operations. Second, awareness about the importance of tools as a&#13;
production factor would increase among government technical agencies. This could lead to&#13;
recommend improvements in the use of these tools, or in tool design.&#13;
19.   Training and Extension Network. The project primarily funds extension activities&#13;
carried out in project villages. County and township-level activities would be limited to&#13;
training the technicians which take part in village activities. Four types of extension channels&#13;
would be supported, because there are existing and potential human resources in each of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
- 87-&#13;
these channels: (a) county and township technicians paying scheduled visits to villages, (b)&#13;
fanner-technicians within project villages, (c) demonstration households, and (d) household&#13;
training. Technicians, from the village to the county level, would both carry out the daily&#13;
tasks of project implementation and provide technical back-up. A variety of extension&#13;
methods would be used in each of the three provinces. In Ningxia, with lower education&#13;
levels, but comparatively easier communication, and more technical recommendations&#13;
generated by the extension system, the core technical follow-up activities would be in the&#13;
form of frequent visits by township specialized technicians to a network of village&#13;
demonstration households.  Seasonal advice would be adjusted to annual climatic&#13;
circumstances. The seasonal visits of demonstration sites by township technicians would&#13;
also be the main media in household training. In Sichuan and Shaanxi, literacy levels in the&#13;
adult population are comparatively higher, but most villages are only accessed by walking,&#13;
and few mountain-specific technical recommendations are readily available for extension.&#13;
Technicians in township project stations would evolve into project staff with comprehensive&#13;
basic technical knowledge. The logistics of township staff undertaking work in project&#13;
villages, which is key to both the component's physical implementation and to successful&#13;
technical extension, would be carefully organized (paragraph 24 of this Annex). Sichuan has&#13;
larger villages (250 households per village or 2,300 per township, versus 150 per village and&#13;
1,200 per township in Shaanxi). In Sichuan, one demonstration household and two farmer-&#13;
technicians on average would be active in each village. In Shaanxi, three demonstration&#13;
households on average would operate in each township, and township technicians would be&#13;
the key technical staff. In both Sichuan and Shaanxi, household training methods would&#13;
combine field days and specific written material. Training would be prepared with domestic&#13;
technical assistance in adult training methods.&#13;
20.   Applied Agricultural Technology Program (AATP). The AATP research investment&#13;
aims to initiate applied on-farm research in the project area, and to support innovations into&#13;
project implementation. Priority research needs have been carefully analyzed, through&#13;
discussions involving project staff from the national and county levels, and with provincial&#13;
researchers (see Attachment 2 to this Annex). Following project appraisal, the provincial&#13;
PMOs have started to identify research teams interested in each topic. The contracts set up&#13;
would include several conditions, such as carrying out all field research on project household&#13;
farms and only undertaking short-term research. Research budgets would include the costs of&#13;
extending outcomes to at least one project county. The three provinces face different&#13;
problems in linking up with researchers. Research on rainfed agriculture relevant to southern&#13;
Ningxia is mainly carried out in neighboring provinces, or is limited to adaptive trials&#13;
undertaken by individual counties. The Sichuan project areas are and will remain marginal in&#13;
the provincial research system. The Sichuan mountain area would develop linkages with&#13;
Shaanxi (e.g., for potato varieties), while technologies primarily developed for the Sichuan&#13;
lowlands would be systematically screened in the project area. In Shaanxi, the program&#13;
would aim to involve provincial researchers in specific research for high-elevation areas,&#13;
which are not marginal in the province. One fifth of the AATP budget would be set aside for&#13;
technical exchanges between researchers of different provinces, for the larger extension of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex-3&#13;
- 88-&#13;
research outcomes, and for domestic technical assistance. The domestic technical assistance&#13;
program would be finalized during the first year of the project. Foreign technical assistance&#13;
would be extremely useful to the AATP in two fields: introduction of genetic material&#13;
adapted to mountain environments, and farming system research and extension. The latter&#13;
field includes economic and marketing analysis as well as appropriate technology design.&#13;
The establishment of direct links with foreign research teams would be sought.&#13;
21.   Technical Facilitation. Provincial project staff in charge of the component would&#13;
divide their time into first, planning, supervision and monitoring and, second, technical&#13;
facilitation. The latter would consist in (a) monitoring technical implementation through&#13;
regular field visits, (b) working with the project's province and county technical groups to&#13;
identify and address technical problems during implementation, and (c) facilitating&#13;
information flow on new technology, and coordinating extension and training activities.&#13;
Major Risks and Preventive Steps Taken&#13;
22.   Ningxia. Climatic risks, resource base imbalances and current poverty levels create&#13;
several major risks: (a) should a major drought year occur during the early years of the&#13;
project, households would have to sell the animals provided under the project for lack of&#13;
water and fodder, and in order to buy wheat, (b) any delay in the voluntary resettlement&#13;
program would slow down implementation of the animal husbandry investment, (c) the&#13;
project area is one of the last regions in northern China having retained a millet-based&#13;
summer cropping pattern despite 10 years of government-sponsored corn production&#13;
programs, so it is anticipated that the adoption of corn cultivation may be slow, (d) if wheat is&#13;
not readily available in remote markets, households will not transfer part of their wheat area&#13;
into summer crops, and (e) Hui indigenous farming practices may not be fully compatible&#13;
with some of the technology packages to be extended (e.g., intercropping). All these&#13;
problems have been thoroughly discussed during preparation. The provision of animals to&#13;
individual project villages would take place in spring, and be conditioned by both the&#13;
progress of the voluntary resettlement program, the amount of fodder stored at the end of&#13;
winter and the success of fodder development activities. Food crop improvement activities&#13;
have been balanced, with less corn, and more potatoes, wheat and linseed. Corn production&#13;
training would help households plan the yearly purchase of seed, fertilizer and plastic mulch.&#13;
Wheat prices on local markets would be monitored. The network of demonstration farmers&#13;
will operate at village level and be composed of Hui farmers in Hui villages. Finally, women&#13;
farmers will attend a specific number training days.&#13;
23.   Marketing. Marketing systems are underdeveloped in the project area, and the&#13;
awareness of market opportunities and risks for mountain agriculture is limited at all levels&#13;
from households to government agencies. A variety of steps have been taken to moderate&#13;
price and other marketing risks. Productions developed under the project will add diversity&#13;
to the existing production systems. The major tree crops to be developed, such as chestnut&#13;
and eucommia, are multipurpose trees, so that their secondary uses can buffer price problems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
- 89-&#13;
for the main product. Several of the productions bearing higher risks, such as silk cocoon,&#13;
tea and peltate yam, are promoted by private sector entities, which will provide inputs and&#13;
technical support, process the products and market them. Farmers' specialized associations,&#13;
which play a facilitating role in marketing for productions ranging from nuts to medicinal&#13;
plants, would be encouraged to become active in the project area. Enhancing the marketing&#13;
quality of tree and cash crop products has been made one of the key technical topics, and&#13;
would be addressed by several applied research topics. Technician and household training&#13;
contents would include market access and risks.&#13;
24.   Village Access in Sichuan and Shaanxi. Access from the road to natural villages is&#13;
difficult in both the Sichuan mountain area and hills. Managing village development plans&#13;
and providing technical services will be difficult to organize and costly. In order to&#13;
overcome this problem, township and village-level technicians and farmer-technicians are&#13;
being specifically trained, and will spend a substantial part of their time in village visits.&#13;
Village-level work schedules including project management, household training and&#13;
technical follow-up are being carefully organized with the help of provinces and counties.&#13;
The cost of intervention at natural village level has been fully taken into account in the&#13;
component budget. Pick-up cars based in township stations will reduce the use of human&#13;
force in transporting agricultural inputs. Full-scale implementation of village development&#13;
plans in several administrative villages in each county during the Retroactive Financing&#13;
Program will provide additional experience on how to organize project logistics. Finally, the&#13;
relatively better-off households developing private services are expected to take part in the&#13;
project's support service network.&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
Land and Farmer Development Component&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
GUIDELINES FOR ENHANCING IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY&#13;
A. QUALITY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VILLAGE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
PLANS&#13;
A.1 Household Investment.&#13;
&gt;The investment received by any beneficiary household for the overall component and for&#13;
the entire duration of the project should not exceed twice the provincial average household&#13;
investment (the county average investment is the component base cost minus extension,&#13;
training and services).&#13;
&gt;Remote natural villages within an administrative village should take equal part in the&#13;
project.&#13;
&gt;Each household in the village should have equal opportunity to take part in the component&#13;
(Shaanxi: the project's priority target consists in the 70% poorer households in project&#13;
villages). No household should be excluded from participating in tree crop or animal raising&#13;
activities because of insufficient education level, or of insufficient assets. No female-headed&#13;
household should be excluded due to insufficient labor.&#13;
&gt;Households participate in the project to undertake agricultural activities by themselves. No&#13;
subcontracting other than technical management contracts occurs between households. Any&#13;
contract must be consistent with standard contracts prepared by provincial PMOs.&#13;
A.2 Project Activities.&#13;
&gt;All project activities are consistent with the administrative village development plan: types&#13;
of activities are consistent with the village plan, and the scale should not exceed the village&#13;
plan.&#13;
&gt;The village project team organizes annual consultation of households on requests for&#13;
adjustment of activities and transmits these requests to township project station. There is full&#13;
flexibility in implementation to take into account agricultural time schedules. For example,&#13;
in case of delay in planting time, one crop may be replaced by another one. When&#13;
adjustments in project activities occur, the village total investment is maintained to its initial&#13;
level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Attachment I&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
&gt;Reporting tables for village plan implementation should note the 6-year target and&#13;
completed scale, both for scale of activities and for numbers of beneficiary households. They&#13;
are (a) collected by township project stations and transmitted to county PMOs, (b) posted in&#13;
township project stations, and (c) updated twice a year.&#13;
&gt;Only direct beneficiaries should take part in land development and tree planting works. No&#13;
labor contribution should be requested from non-beneficiary households. Work plans are&#13;
organized in order to minimize disturbance of farmers' seasonal off-farm migration.&#13;
A.3 Village Land and Resource Management.&#13;
&gt;PMOs at all levels are responsible for ensuring the implementation of county policies on&#13;
stable long-term land use rights for all land developed under the project (50 years).&#13;
Households have the right to request a formal contract title from the PMO.&#13;
&gt;The selection of optimum location within a village of newly developed land, of tree&#13;
plantations, of artificial pasture, and of water resource development involves both the&#13;
households, the village project team and the technicians in charge. Terraces are built on more&#13;
fertile land close to villages. Consensus on the management of animal grazing to prevent&#13;
damage to crops or trees should also be sought. Households should decide to include their&#13;
plots in land development or tree plantation activities on a voluntary basis.&#13;
&gt;The development of drinking or irrigation water facilities should be planned at the village&#13;
level. Infrastructure development for individual households should not have any negative&#13;
impact on the water resources of neighboring households.&#13;
&gt;Shaanxi: in villages under the Yangtze watershed reforestation program, tree crop&#13;
development by poor households should take place not only on wasteland and individual land&#13;
but also on forestry land. Animal grazing is regulated but not forbidden.&#13;
&gt;The township project station should undertake (before year 3 of the project) an assessment&#13;
of the carrying capacity for grazing animals and of fodder development needs during the&#13;
project (Ningxia: during year 1).&#13;
&gt;Ningxia: at the end of each year, the village project team should decide -- in consultation&#13;
with households -- the maximum number of animals to be purchased during the year on the&#13;
basis of fodder storage levels.&#13;
B. QUALITY OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY&#13;
B.1 Focus Technical Issues.&#13;
&gt;County technical specifications, provincial PMO technical support as well as training,&#13;
demonstration and extension activities should focus on the following five issues: (1)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
increasing and sustaining soil fertility on newly developed land, (2) winter fodder resources,&#13;
(3) the quality of seeds, seedlings and animals, (4) successful tree establishment, and (5) the&#13;
marketing viability of cash and tree crop products.&#13;
B.2 County Technical Specifications.&#13;
B.2.1 Review and Updating.&#13;
&gt;The component's unit cost tables describe average technical packages across the project area&#13;
in each province. Any substantial difference between county technical specifications and&#13;
these tables should be identified and reviewed by the provincial PMOs.&#13;
&gt;Annual updating of recommended technology should take place through technical wrap-&#13;
ups, which should include exchanges between counties, and dissemination to counties of the&#13;
results of on-going activities under the Applied Agricultural Technology Program. Technical&#13;
specifications will be updated at project mid-term review.&#13;
B.2.2 Contents of Technical Specifications.&#13;
&gt;Land Development. After terracing, the maximum slope of the planting area should be 1%&#13;
in Ningxia and 5° in Sichuan and Shaanxi. Key points in terrace design to insure long-term&#13;
viability (maximum height of wall, angle of wall, use of concrete in walled terraces, drainage&#13;
system) should be detailed. Ningxia: varieties and planting patterns of erosion control tree&#13;
and bush belts to be planted on the edge of all terraces should be listed. Yearly application&#13;
rates of organic and balanced chemical fertilizer, including N and P (and K in Sichuan) after&#13;
terracing should be specified.  Contour-line planting when using plastic mulch is&#13;
recommended.&#13;
&gt;Food Crops. Corn, potato and wheat varieties should be listed with their respective&#13;
optimum sowing time. Varieties should be adapted to the project area and to households'&#13;
needs. (These varieties are those recommended in current extension plans.)&#13;
&gt;Cash Crops. Varieties (cultivars) should be carefully selected for their commercial&#13;
viability. There should not be any negative impact of cash crop development on the&#13;
environment. Tuber crops should be planted on mild slopes. Neither planting material nor&#13;
harvested product should be collected from wild resources.&#13;
&gt;Tree Crops. Tree varieties, both rootstock and graftings, should be quality varieties adapted&#13;
to local soil and climate conditions, and to market needs. The proportion of pollinating trees&#13;
should be specified for relevant species. In order to minimize the risk of erosion, the area of&#13;
vegetation cover disturbed at planting should be as limited as possible, provided that&#13;
sufficient space around seedlings is maintained free of weeds. Seedlings should be planted in&#13;
alternate rows, and contour-line trenches should be dug when necessary to improve drainage.&#13;
Both organic and chemical fertilizer should be applied in the planting pit. Fertilizer&#13;
application rates at the time of planting will be substantially greater than for subsequent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
years. Two intercropping patterns should be described, one with normal tree density, and the&#13;
other with low density. Tree management from planting to first harvest should be described,&#13;
including one pruning method for each species and recommended micronutrient applications.&#13;
Types of trees or sites not suitable for rehabilitation of mulberry or tea should be excluded.&#13;
On-farm storage conditions should be specified. Primary processing of tea should be done by&#13;
the households in villages which are too distant from the tea processing plant.&#13;
&gt;Animal Raising. Households investing in animal raising must adequately develop their&#13;
winter fodder resources. A range of fodder resources (in addition to ammoniated straw)&#13;
should be recommended for each county. Species, harvesting calendars and yearly fertilizer&#13;
requirements of artificial pasture should be indicated. Balanced combinations of on-farm&#13;
feed resources, protein feed and purchased minerals and additives should also be quantified.&#13;
Sichuan and Shaanxi: the design of newly built animal sheds should allow for easy handling&#13;
of fodder. A design with earth ground floor and wooden upper floor is recommended.&#13;
Vaccination and preventive treatment schedules should be specified.&#13;
B.3 Timely Provision of Quality Inputs.&#13;
&gt;All Inputs. Provision of inputs to villages should be done in a timely manner based on&#13;
sufficient storage of the inputs at the township. Households have the right to have and&#13;
express reservations when they doubt the quality of the inputs or their timely delivery.&#13;
&gt;Fertilizer. The types of chemical fertilizers provided to households should be urea and DAP&#13;
(and potassium sulfate in Sichuan). Fertilizers should remain in their original bags which&#13;
should mention the certified nutrient content. Fertilizer quantities delivered to households&#13;
should be consistent with county technical specifications. Farmers should be provided with&#13;
fertilizer for tree crops for every year from plantation until: year 2 for Ningxia timber and&#13;
bushes; year 3 for mulberry and for Ningxia fruit trees; year 4 for other species except nuts;&#13;
and year 5 for chestnut and walnut.&#13;
&gt;Seeds and Seedlings.  Varieties should be those mentioned in the county technical&#13;
specifications, and seeds and seedlings should have received certification through pre-harvest&#13;
inspection in accordance with national quality standards (class I and class II). All potato seed&#13;
should be virus-free (except Sichuan, for which all potato seed will be virus-free beginning in&#13;
year 4). In Ningxia, all corn seed will be pesticide-coated. Seed companies receiving project&#13;
investments should make annual plans to supply their best varieties to several project&#13;
counties. For grafted tree species (fruit, mulberry, and nuts), only grafted seedlings will be&#13;
provided (except for chestnut which is partially grafted after plantation, and for which special&#13;
grafting teams will be organized by the project). Nurseries receiving project investments&#13;
must arrange technical support contracts with a specialized technician. Nursery managers&#13;
and workers should undergo specific training. Seedlings will be sold primarily within the&#13;
project area, with careful organization of rapid transportation from nursery to the project&#13;
village. Project households may come to the nursery themselves to obtain seedlings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex-3&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
&gt;Pesticides. Pesticides should be provided in their original containers, and must be covered&#13;
under the list approved by the World Bank.&#13;
&gt;Plastic Mulch. Plastic mulch provided to project households should be of standard quality.&#13;
&gt;Animals. In Sichuan, all pigs provided by the project should be Fl hybrids except in the&#13;
most remote (20%) mountain villages. For cows and goats, all animals provided to&#13;
households should be improved local breeds. For the pig and goat breeding service and for&#13;
Ningxia sheep/goats, male animals should be of pure improved breed. In Ningxia, artificial&#13;
insemination services should reach 80% of the number of cows provided by the project on an&#13;
annual basis. In Sichuan, animal breeders receiving project investments should primarily sell&#13;
their production to project households. Project animals should have been vaccinated at the&#13;
time of purchase. Lastly, the contents of mineral and feed additives and protein feed should&#13;
be specified on the bags provided to the households.&#13;
&gt;Tools. Farmers should select the small tools they wish to purchase through the project.&#13;
County PMOs should maintain a record of the types of tools needed by households and&#13;
recommended providers of adequate quality tools. Small mechanized tools should be&#13;
operated by private households and service project villages.  Fees charged to project&#13;
households for mechanized tool services should be reviewed by the county PMOs.&#13;
B.4. Quality of Works&#13;
B.4.1 Land Development.&#13;
&gt;Paddy drainage should follow the standards of the county soil and fertilizer station. The&#13;
station should prepare a detailed design map, and a copy of that map will be kept at the&#13;
township project station.&#13;
&gt;Terracing works should be overseen by one village cadre and one farmer technician in each&#13;
village. These two staff should have undergone specific project training. Stone works should&#13;
be carried out by skilled workers. In Sichuan, hilly area land terracing operations should&#13;
always include some stone works for drainage. In Ningxia, works should follow the&#13;
standards specified by the Sanxi Commission. The detailed design map should specify the&#13;
area where top soil has to be set aside (in order to be put back after terracing). Works should&#13;
be overseen during operation by the 'design representative'.&#13;
B.4.2 Tree Planting.&#13;
&gt;The adequacy of site (elevation, pH, drainage) should be checked by a township technician.&#13;
For each 50 to 100 hectares of plantations, at least one soil analysis should be made, and one&#13;
farmer technician should be trained in seedling handling and planting skills. The farmer&#13;
technician should take part in the planting operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex3&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
-95-&#13;
&gt;Adequate transport capacity for fertilizer should be organized for planting sites which are&#13;
distant from the village or the nearest road.&#13;
&gt;Pit digging and planting schedules should be organized independently from inspection-and-&#13;
acceptance.&#13;
&gt;All seedlings which have not survived should be replaced in the following year.&#13;
&gt;For mulberry rehabilitation in Sichuan, grafting should only be done by skilled workers. A&#13;
township technician should designate trees fit for grafting. For tea rehabilitation in Sichuan,&#13;
a village situation map demarcating areas where rehabilitation is feasible should be prepared&#13;
by the county tea rehabilitation specialist.&#13;
C. QUALITY OF TRAINING AND EXTENSION&#13;
C.A Household Training.&#13;
&gt;Training activities should be organized to cover a large audience in each village. Plans to&#13;
train a minimum of 30% of the households in each village and an optimum of 60% are&#13;
progressing on schedule (Ningxia: a minimum of 50% and an optimum of 100%).&#13;
&gt;Trainers should be trained township technicians or county technicians. One training day&#13;
lasts at least 5 hours, and no more than 50 people at a time should attend a training day. Each&#13;
trainee attends on average 4 training days. Training activities include both in-door sessions&#13;
and seasonal visits of demonstration sites.&#13;
&gt;Trainees should be provided with training materials. The training materials compiled by the&#13;
provincial PMO should be adapted to a semi-illiterate audience in its concepts, language and&#13;
sketch drawings. They should updated once at the project mid-term review.&#13;
&gt;In Sichuan and Shaanxi, at least 33% of trainees should be women. In Ningxia, women will&#13;
be encouraged to take part in technical training sessions, and specific additional sessions will&#13;
be provided for women in each county.&#13;
&gt;The county PMOs will keep records of training session attendance. These records will&#13;
include the time, duration, trainer, number of trainees, topics, training materials delivered,&#13;
and numbers of women trained.&#13;
C.2 Demonstration Households.&#13;
&gt;Demonstration households will be selected on a voluntary basis in each administrative&#13;
village, and a substantial number should be the project area's poorest households.&#13;
Households should organize informal extension activities in the village during each year of&#13;
the project.  In 'Sichuan and Shaanxi, women farmers and young farmers should be&#13;
encouraged to become demonstration farmers. Technology packages used by demonstration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex-3&#13;
Attachment I&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
households should be similar to that of their neighbors, and demonstration fields should&#13;
include new terraces.&#13;
&gt;Township technicians should visit demonstration households at least twice a year every&#13;
year.&#13;
&gt;The county PMO should keep a list indicating village and demonstration household names.&#13;
C.3 Extension.&#13;
&gt;Food crop, tree crop and animal raising extension activities funded by the project should&#13;
include: field visits of township and county technicians to villages and to households other&#13;
than demonstration households; preparation of and undertaking of visits by households to&#13;
demonstration sites (other than during household training days); soil analysis fees; and&#13;
printed materials distributed to households (other than training materials).&#13;
&gt;County PMOs should organize work plans for the township technicians. The work plans&#13;
should specify the numbers of days spent in village visits and the numbers of visits per year&#13;
to each project village. In Sichuan and Shaanxi, crop, animal husbandry or tree crop&#13;
township technicians should spend a total of at least 9 days (other than household training&#13;
days) in each project village every year. In Ningxia, seasonal extension field days (4 days for&#13;
food crops and 4 days for animal raising) should take place in each project village each year.&#13;
In all three project provinces, one county technician will pay at least one visit to each project&#13;
village during the project. In Sichuan, the silk production support service should provide&#13;
project villages with services equivalent to those in lowland areas.&#13;
&gt;Project vehicles will be small pick-ups for transportation of people and agricultural&#13;
supplies, and are to be used primarily for activities in the project villages. Individual items&#13;
for extension equipment remain below Y 1,000 (except refrigerators). No soil analysis&#13;
equipment will be procured (except simple pH measuring devices).&#13;

Land and Farmer Development Component&#13;
Attachment 2&#13;
Applied Agricultural Technology Program: Priority Research Needs&#13;
Land Development.&#13;
- Soil fertility on newlv developed land (Sichuan mountains and hills). Counties' technology&#13;
packages for newly-built terraces (in terms of soil tillage, chemical and organic fertilizer&#13;
applications, cropping patterns, types of varieties) need to be compared and improved to&#13;
ensure successful use of modern food crop varieties right after terrace construction.&#13;
- Micro-irrigation (Ningxia). The extension of micro-irrigation in the project area is just&#13;
starting. Water-saving irrigation practices, related crop technology packages and cropping&#13;
patterns need to be refined.&#13;
Winter Fodder Resources.&#13;
- Cows and goats (Shaanxi, and Sichuan mountains). Processing and storage methods other&#13;
than straw ammoniation need to be improved and extended. In Shaanxi, optimum species for&#13;
artificial pasture need to be identified. Animal feeding calendars would be studied in&#13;
Sichuan, fodder storage in both provinces.&#13;
- Non-grain pig diets (Sichuan hills).  Sweet potato leaves and tubers account for an&#13;
important share of pig diets in Sichuan. Alternative sources of non-grain fodder would&#13;
diversify and increase feed resources. A range of such sources have been identified among&#13;
which arrow-root, and enzymatic fermentation of paddy straw, but they need to be combined&#13;
with existing feed sources into balanced diets.&#13;
- Forage species (Ningxia). Artificial cut-and-carry pasture mainly consists in alfalfa and&#13;
fodder grain species (sorghum and oats) grown on fertile plots. Improved cultivars within&#13;
these species need to be identified. In addition, land is available to grow additional forage,&#13;
particularly on salinized soils around small gully checkdams, but tolerant varieties from both&#13;
China and abroad need to be introduced and screened.&#13;
Grain Crop Varieties.&#13;
- Corn and rice (Sichuan mountains and hills). Hybrid varieties are outdated, particularly in&#13;
terms of grain quality. The area is too marginal to justify specific variety selection. A&#13;
network of multilocal variety screening trials in the project area needs to be set up to&#13;
regularly test upcoming varieties.&#13;
- Com (Shaanxi). Available hybrids are too late-maturing for high elevations. A range of&#13;
existing commercial hybrids needs to be introduced and screened.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex3&#13;
Attachment 2&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
- Wheat (Sichuan mountains and hills). Modem varieties have not been adopted. Little is&#13;
known about the potential of modem varieties versus indigenous ones under the specifically&#13;
cold, damp but drought-prone local climate. Local and introduced varieties need to be&#13;
screened, and interactions between varieties, seed processing and fanning practices need to&#13;
be studied.&#13;
- Potatoes (Sichuan mountains). No virus-free seed multiplication network has been set up in&#13;
the province. Seeds could be supplied from neighboring Shaanxi. There is a need to link up&#13;
with southern Shaanxi potato seed system, and to screen available varieties.&#13;
Tree Crops.&#13;
- Gingko (Sichuan mountains). Yields are lower than in China's main production area. There&#13;
is a need to understand the relative impact on yield of site selection (soil and microclimate)&#13;
and of planting technology, and to identify optimum practice. This would require a&#13;
comparative survey of existing sites, locally and in main production area, and an assessment&#13;
of the impact of improved technology at planting time on early development (including&#13;
nursery quality, planting pattern, soil preparation and seedling handling).&#13;
- Chestnut (Sichuan mountains and Shaanxi) and walnut (Sichuan mountains). Existing&#13;
planting material has been selected for lower-elevation areas. In addition, there is no&#13;
established network for the selection and maintenance of quality planting material. There is a&#13;
need for introduction and early screening of material, and for technical assistance to set up a&#13;
parent material maintenance system.&#13;
- Eucommia (Sichuan and Shaanxi). Current bark peeling methods, as well as excessive&#13;
interplanting densities, reduce tree longevity. On-farm trials of short-term rotation and&#13;
regeneration are proposed Sichuan, while strip peeling would be tested in Shaanxi. There is a&#13;
need to design improved interplanting patterns.&#13;
Marketing Viability of Cash and Tree Crop Products.&#13;
- Peltate yam (Shaanxi). The economic viability of this crop is highly dependent on tuber&#13;
hormone contents. Interactions between these contents, parent material and crop technology&#13;
need to be better understood.&#13;
- On-farm fruit storage (Sichuan mountains or hills). The lapse of time between harvest and&#13;
delivery to purchaser justifies improved storage means.&#13;
- Silkworm production system (Shaanxi). The supply of healthy silkworms of improved&#13;
strains is essential to improve the quality of cocoons. This requires the introduction of&#13;
adequate parent material, and a multiplication support service adapted to mountain villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Attachment 2&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
Farming systems.&#13;
- Comparative assessment of technical recommendations (Sichuan mountain and hills). Past&#13;
extension programs have faced very low adoption rates by farmers. There is a need first to&#13;
compare yields obtained with recommended technology packages and those obtained with&#13;
farmers' traditional practices, then to identify other obstacles in the adoption of innovations.&#13;
This would require comparative on-farm trials, and household surveys.&#13;
- Appropriate technology for high-elevation villages (Shaanxi). Poor villages in high-&#13;
elevation areas feature specific farming systems, face specific and harder constraints, but&#13;
have not attracted attention from research programs. A comprehensive program of survey&#13;
and trials in one or a few villages would both provide benchmark information and allow&#13;
identification of a range of improvements. This would require a village-level research&#13;
program combining a comprehensive survey of present farming practices, and introduction,&#13;
design and test of improved technology.&#13;
- Reducing labor requirements of silkworm raising (Sichuan mountain and hills). Silkworm&#13;
raising is based on high inputs of female labor. Women's labor is limiting in poor&#13;
households, particularly as men increasingly outmigrate for off-farm work. Small tools and&#13;
other technology reducing labor requirements need to be researched (Sichuan mountains or&#13;
hills).&#13;
- Corn planting pattern (Ningxia). Plastic-mulch hybrid corn is the only technically feasible&#13;
package for corn with current varieties in the project area. The strategy in variety selection&#13;
has consisted in introducing later-maturing, low-density varieties. With these varieties,&#13;
plastic costs have become too high. There is a need to design lower-cost packages for&#13;
adoption by farmers. This includes intercropping corn under plastic mulch with another crop.&#13;
However, since intercropping may not be adapted to Hui farmers, other cost-reducing options&#13;
also need to be studied.&#13;
Other.&#13;
- Grain crop pests and diseases (Sichuan mountains). A few pests and diseases are specific to&#13;
the Daba mountains and have not been researched before despite their impact on yields.&#13;
- Potential cash crop and animal species (Shaanxi). Few agricultural income generating&#13;
options are available to high-elevation areas. Mushrooms and other wild plants, and wild&#13;
animals, are collected for sale, but resources are declining. The domestication of several&#13;
species would deserve research.&#13;
- Cultivation of edible mushroom (Shaanxi). Edible mushroom production is shifting from&#13;
the non-sustainable use of oak timber as substratum to substitute cultivation substratum.&#13;
Related technology needs to be refined.&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Qinba Microfinance Component&#13;
1.    This annex presents the following information concerning the microfinance&#13;
component: (i) background, (ii) objectives and legal status, (iii) methodology and&#13;
training, (iv) loan processing, interest rates and fees, (v) branch operations, (vi) financial&#13;
sustainability, and (vii) supervision.  These represent the central elements of the&#13;
operational manual provided by the cooperatives and the central project management&#13;
office in chinese to the Bank during appraisal. This operational manual includes policies&#13;
and procedures concerning provision of loans to groups of clients for specific types of&#13;
productive activities.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    Low income households in China's rural areas lack access to credit. The formal&#13;
financial system provides only basic credit and savings services to well-connected&#13;
households in county seats and nearby rural areas. Most credit is provided through state&#13;
agencies (for mandatory crop programs), rural collectives, and state-owned enterprises.&#13;
A small proportion is lent to better-off families with physical assets to use as collateral.&#13;
While the formal sector is unresponsive to the credit needs of low income and poor rural&#13;
households, informal arrangements are growing. However, they are expensive, often&#13;
seasonally limited, and tend to miss poor areas. This credit shortage is one feature of the&#13;
local economy which keeps the majority of poor households with potentially profitable&#13;
economic activities below the poverty line.&#13;
3.    The Chinese government views microfinance as a promising solution to this&#13;
problem, and has encouraged several donor-supported microfinance experiments to&#13;
contribute to poverty reduction. The largest experiment is the action research initiative in&#13;
Hebei and Henan Province operated by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Rural&#13;
Development Institute and supported by the Ford Foundation. The pilot in the Qinba&#13;
project will make an important contribution to these lessons, particularly through&#13;
demonstration of practices necessary to ensure financial sustainability of microfinance&#13;
institutions. The Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest (CGAP) has contributed to the&#13;
pilot design. Other microfinance pilots in nationally designated poor counties are&#13;
supported by the United Nations Development Program, GTZ, Canadian CIDA and&#13;
AusAid.&#13;
Objectives and Legal Status&#13;
4.    The pilot's primary objective is to provide credit and savings services to low-&#13;
income households with potentially profitable economic activities through two financially&#13;
sustainable cooperatives. The cooperatives have already been established in Ankang City&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
(Shaanxi Province) and Langzhong County (Sichuan Province) and are registered with&#13;
the County Bureau of Civil Affairs. Like other microfinance pilots, the cooperatives are&#13;
registered as "social organizations."&#13;
5.    Given the high minimum equity requirements and other regulations governing the&#13;
development of new Chinese financial institutions, the cooperatives would not become&#13;
full-fledged commercial banking institutions during the life of the project. However, it is&#13;
anticipated that the cooperatives could become trust and investment companies. The&#13;
cooperatives and the central project management office plan to actively pursue this&#13;
change in legal status. This change would subject them to formal regulation under rules&#13;
recently developed for non-bank financial institutions. Over a six year period, over&#13;
16,000 households would receive working capital loans and establish savings accounts.&#13;
Methodology and Targeting&#13;
6.    Methodolovgy. The cooperatives would be based on an adaptation of the Grameen&#13;
Bank (Bangladesh) model, which currently provides one-year working capital loans to 2&#13;
million poor borrowers using a joint liability group methodology. Joint liability groups&#13;
mutually insure the working capital loans of members, covering the payments of those&#13;
members who face unexpected repayment problems. This has proven to be an effective&#13;
substitute for physical collateral for low income households in a number of Asian&#13;
countries.&#13;
7.    Groups would be formed based on voluntary participation of low income&#13;
households with potentially profitable productive activities, reflecting microfinance&#13;
international best practice. Each group would consist of five members, who select a&#13;
leader. Group members would qualify for loans for productive activities in which they&#13;
have significant experience, and their creditworthiness would be judged by the group.&#13;
8.    Targeting. Households facing a chronic grain deficit would not qualify as group&#13;
members. Microfinance experiences show that placing such households in debt is&#13;
harmful for the households and endangers sustainability of the program. However, these&#13;
households would be eligible for other project activities to build assets so that they would&#13;
eventually qualify for group membership.&#13;
9.    The cooperatives held detailed discussions with a large sample of poor households&#13;
in project areas to identify production cycles, household cashflow patterns, and&#13;
transaction cost preferences. Based on these interviews, group meetings would be held&#13;
every ten days in the village to collect loan installments, interest and mandatory savings.&#13;
All requirements (such as the interest rate and fee structure, mandatory savings, and&#13;
group funds, which are a member-controlled form of collateral) would be presented in a&#13;
transparent manner to group members during orientation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
- 102-&#13;
10.  Interviews with poor households demonstrated the importance of keeping&#13;
transaction costs low. Training would be provided to groups in how to review loan&#13;
applications, conduct regular meetings, collect loan installments and interest, and enforce&#13;
loan contracts to lower these costs. Average loan processing time (from application to&#13;
disbursement) would be less than two weeks, thanks to group review of proposed member&#13;
investments. Significant participation of women in groups would raise the effectiveness&#13;
of the program. The number of groups is expected to expand slowly during the first two&#13;
years, providing the cooperatives time to understand clients' needs and group dynamics.&#13;
Loan Processing, Interest Rates and Fees&#13;
11.   The project would effectively target low income households by limiting initial&#13;
one-year loan to at most Y1000 (that is, an amount just less than twice the national per&#13;
capita poverty line of Y550/year). Subsequent loans would grow by no more than 30% at&#13;
the end of the one-year loan (that is, second loans would be at most Y1,300, and third&#13;
loans at most Y1,690). Loans will be repaid in 34 equal ten-day installments of principal,&#13;
interest and compulsory savings. Only groups with all members paying installments on&#13;
time and contributing mandatory savings would be eligible for subsequent loans.&#13;
12.    Productive investments would be decided by the households, based on a wide&#13;
menu of technically viable productive activities, such as agricultural processing&#13;
(including oilseed and fodder), animal husbandry (such as pigs, sheep, oxen), cash crops&#13;
(such as traditional medicines and tea), small stores, trade and small service businesses&#13;
(such as food preparation). Loan applications would be approved by the group members&#13;
and reviewed and approved by centers (consisting of 5-6 groups). Loan officers would&#13;
review the proposed activity to insure that it can generate adequate cashflow to cover the&#13;
loan installments.&#13;
13.   The nominal interest rate will be 8% (on the face value of the loan), with a 3%&#13;
upfront application fee, a mandatory 5% group savings fund, and installments every ten&#13;
days. This amounts to a real effective interest rate of 14. 1%. The interest rate would be&#13;
adjusted to reflect changes in the rate of inflation and commercial bank interest rates.&#13;
While this rate of interest may not be sufficient to cover all expenses during the set-up&#13;
stage, it would be adequate to insure financial sustainability with increased loan activity&#13;
in later stages of the project (after adjusting for the subsidized rate of interest set by the&#13;
ADBC and the Provincial Finance Bureau).&#13;
14.   Langzhong County will experiment with a specialized line of credit for existing&#13;
microenterprises, not to exceed 10% of the average annual outstanding loan portfolio&#13;
(with initial average loan size of Y1500 to Y2000). These microenterprises could provide&#13;
physical assets as collateral, and would be able to borrow individually or through joint&#13;
liability groups. Investment would be likely to include small scale transportation, service&#13;
and agricultural or mineral processing activities. Approval criteria for these loans would&#13;
include adequate cashflow to cover loan installments, demonstrated commercial viability,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
and the potential for jobs creation for surplus laborers from project area poor households.&#13;
The interest rate structure would be the same as the group-based loan system.&#13;
Branch Operations&#13;
15.   Mature branch offices would be staffed by a manager, an accountant, an internal&#13;
auditor, a cashier and six loan officers. Centers (consisting of 5-6 groups) would be&#13;
headed by a director elected by the groups. All directors, managers, accountants and&#13;
auditors would have formal banking experience. Loan officers should have experience&#13;
working with poor farmers, some knowledge of agriculture and animal husbandry, and&#13;
basic financial analysis skills.&#13;
16.   One of the strengths of a group-based system is the number of borrowers that a&#13;
loan officer can serve, which contributes to low operating costs. For Ankang and&#13;
Langzhong, an experienced loan officer is expected to provide financial services to 300 to&#13;
360 group members. This is consistent with loan officer to client ratios in Grameen Bank&#13;
and other group-based models in Asia.&#13;
Financial Sustainability&#13;
17.   After initial support from the Qinba project, the loan portfolio would be largely&#13;
financed by loan installment repayments, available local funds (such as government&#13;
poverty alleviation funds channeled through the ADBC), fees and savings generated by&#13;
poor households. Based on conservative average loan size and loan portfolio projections,&#13;
the cooperatives should be financially sustainable by the end of the project, and able to&#13;
turn to commercially priced sources of capital for expansion into new communities.&#13;
However, there are broader financial sector policy issues which could affect the long term&#13;
sustainability of the cooperatives.&#13;
18.  In the start-up phase, both cooperatives need sufficient grant funding to ensure the&#13;
demand for new loans can be met. The Langzhong credit cooperative has mobilized grant&#13;
funds from Sichuan Province to begin operations. The Ankang cooperative has only been&#13;
able to mobilize loans from ADBC and the Provincial Finance Bureau. In the long term,&#13;
the Ankang cooperative is considering selling internally tradeable shares to members to&#13;
bolster the equity side of its balance sheet.&#13;
19.  In accordance with microfinance best practices, the loan portfolio will comprise&#13;
55% to 70% of total assets. The loan loss reserve is set initially at 5% of the average&#13;
outstanding loan portfolio, but could decrease substantially as groups prove their ability&#13;
to enforce loan contracts. The portfolio at risk method of calculating overdue loan&#13;
balances will be used, classifying each loan with one installment more than one day late&#13;
as an overdue loan. Partial payments by groups to the cooperative would be discouraged&#13;
in order to encourage group members to enforce the loan agreement as problems arise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
20.   Key financial performance ratios to be used to monitor the cooperatives would&#13;
include the following: (i) adjusted rate of return on average annual assets, (ii) portfolio at&#13;
risk, (iii) cost per yuan lent, and (iv) average initial loan size (to insure appropriate&#13;
targeting). The cooperatives would be trained in the CAMEL system, which includes&#13;
indicators on capital adequacy, asset quality, management and staff systems, earnings&#13;
(profitability), and liquidity management.  Liquidity management would play an&#13;
especially important role, given the reimbursement system employed by the Bank (at&#13;
50% disbursement based on the standard statement of expenses system) and the&#13;
expectations of clients that larger loans would be available within two weeks of the on-&#13;
time repayment of the final loan installment. The CAMEL system is used by a number of&#13;
successful microfinance institutions.&#13;
21.   During project preparation, the project management team enhanced its knowledge&#13;
of microfinance best practices. The Sichuan and Shaanxi project management offices&#13;
visited Chinese pilot microfinance projects and reviewed technical materials on Grameen&#13;
Bank and AIM (the Malaysian replication of the Grameen model). The staff also&#13;
participated in a one-week Microfinance Conference sponsored by CGAP, the Ford&#13;
Foundation and UNDP, and have been advised by a number of microfinance specialists.&#13;
Cooperative managers and loan officers staff received extensive financial training from&#13;
the central project management office&#13;
Supervision&#13;
22.   Supervision will take place on various levels including periodic reviews by (i) an&#13;
external management team (representing county and provincial PMOs, the municipal&#13;
government, and ADBC), (ii) an internal auditor, (iii) audits by the Provincial Audit&#13;
Administration and (iv) an independent auditor with experience in banking operations.&#13;
23.   The Bank would regularly review the progress of the component, based on site&#13;
visits (to insure accurate targeting of poor households and the effective use of groups as a&#13;
means of delivering financial services) and a review of key financial indicators (along the&#13;
lines of the CAMEL system, described above) and the reports issued by internal and&#13;
independent external auditors.&#13;

Vision of a Community at Project Full Development&#13;
1.    After project completion, average annual per capita income in a typical project&#13;
community would increase to more than the nationally defined absolute poverty line of Y 320 (in&#13;
constant 1992 prices). At least 10 percent of project villagers would gain access to off-farm&#13;
employment opportunities through labor mobility programs and TVE development. About 780&#13;
administrative villages (or 57 percent of the remaining currently without access to road) would&#13;
be connected by a basic (Class IV) road to the existing network of county roads. About 116,000&#13;
households in 786 administrative villages would benefit by electrification schemes (all&#13;
administrative villages would be provided with electricity at the end of the project). The village&#13;
would most likely have access to one of the 34 strategically placed farmers markets which would&#13;
provide affordable inputs and profitable outlets for products. In four out of five households, one&#13;
member would master one or two new farming skills.  Terracing, irrigation schemes,&#13;
improvement of low-yield fields, and extension programs would be main factors contributing to&#13;
expected yield increases of about 40 percent for wheat, 35 percent for corn, 20 percent for potato,&#13;
and 40 percent increase in corn stalk for fodder use. Most project households would take part in&#13;
the planting and maintenance of tree and bush species on steeply sloped hillsides and wastelands,&#13;
and nearly two-thirds of project households would undertake animal breeding and fattening&#13;
activities. The capacity of village organizations to strategize and to manage their own resources&#13;
would be strengthened through the development and use of a participatory (including women and&#13;
minorities) integrated village development planning system.&#13;
2.   In addition, the health and education programs undertaken in parallel with the project&#13;
would complement the improvements in employment opportunities, infrastructure and&#13;
agriculture production techniques. Through the establishment and reconstruction of village&#13;
teaching points, primary school enrollment and completion rates would approximate the&#13;
provincial averages of that time. The existing village health care clinic would be strengthened&#13;
or, if none existed, one would be built. Each clinic would receive at least one new village health&#13;
aide and salary increments would be provided to qualified health aides. Infant mortality rates&#13;
would be reduced from more than 10 percent at present to no more than 5 percent at full&#13;
development, and the maternal mortality ratio would be reduced by more than 30 percent. Safe&#13;
drinking water would be provided to 60 percent of the 30 percent remaining population currently&#13;
without safe drinking water, thus reducing diarrheal and water-related diseases and decreasing&#13;
the time and labor women are required to spend supplying water for their families and livestock.&#13;

The Xihaigu Region of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which receives less than 400 mm&#13;
in annual rainfall on average, had sufferred three years of continuous drought at the time these&#13;
photos were taken. Crop production declined sharply, and the population would not have&#13;
survived without governrment assistance and relief grain.&#13;

EduIation: Only 30 of the 70 school age children in this extremely poor village in Tongxin&#13;
County (Ningxia) attend elementary school. One of the children in the photo stated that he had&#13;
walked five kilometers to school at 7:00 a.m. of the morning of the project preparation team's&#13;
visit to Tongxin County that day. He also stated that he would return home by foot that&#13;
evening at 5:00 p.m. and have his first and only meal of the day at home that evening. In&#13;
another village visited by the project preparation team in Tongxin County, none of the 50&#13;
school age children had attended school for the four years since the local elementary school&#13;
collapsed.&#13;

            China - Qinba Mountains Poverty Reduction Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The principal objectives of the Qinba
            Mountains Poverty Reduction Project are to: (a) demonstrate
            the effectiveness of a focused multisectoral rural
            development project approach to poverty reduction; (b)
            facilitate a "market-friendly" increase in labor
            mobility from the poor areas to better-off rural and rapidly
            growing urban areas; (c) upgrade poverty monitoring at the
            national and local levels; and (d) significantly reduce
            absolute poverty in 26 of the very poorest counties in the
            Qinba mountains region.  The project will also stabilize or
            even reverse upland environmental destruction through land
            and pasture improvement and soil conservation works, and
            encourage greater local community participation by enabling
            households to make key decisions during project design and
            implementation.  The project will comprise the following six
            components: 1) labor mobility; 2) rural infrastructure; 3)
            land and farmer development; 4) township and village
            enterprise (TVE) development; 5) microfinance; and 6)
            institution building and poverty monitoring.
