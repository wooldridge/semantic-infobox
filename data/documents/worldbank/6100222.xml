Alternative Technologies&#13;
for Water and Sanitation Supply&#13;
in Small Towns&#13;
&#13;
This document is an abstract of the Proceedings of the International Symposium on Alternative&#13;
Technologies for Water and Sanitation Supply in Small Towns held in Peru, in April 2004. It provides&#13;
technical information on costs and requirements for the operation and maintenance of alternative&#13;
technologies for small towns, as well as includes references to documents or web sites, where further&#13;
information on technological options can be found.&#13;

     In order to better respond to the specific needs of small towns, an International&#13;
     Symposium on Alternative Technologies for Water and Sanitation Supply in&#13;
     Small Towns was held in Lima, Peru, in April 2004.&#13;

            This document is an abstract of the
            Proceedings of the International Symposium on Alternative
            Technologies for Water and Sanitation Supply in Small Towns
            held in Peru, in April 2004. It provides technical
            information on costs and requirements for the operation and
            maintenance of alternative technologies for small towns, as
            well as includes references to documents or web sites.
