THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;

the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 13,730&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 25&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 28*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

tells only part of the story, so do changes in that ranking.          This measure shows how far on average an economy is&#13;
Yearly movements in rankings can provide some indication              from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

      NIP, Statistical Office and ZUS&#13;
&#13;
      After the latest reform of the Act on the National Court Register, the&#13;
      newly established companies are given tax identification number (NIP)&#13;
      and statistical number (REGON) automatically and within few days of&#13;
      court registration without submitting any additional forms concerning&#13;
      NIP and REGON. Additional required information should be submitted&#13;
      directly to the authorities after the registration.&#13;
&#13;
      During the company registration, the applicant can also obtain the&#13;
      statistical number (REGON) and the tax identification number (NIP).&#13;
      Since 1 December 2014, the applicant does not have to file separate&#13;
      motions for obtaining tax identification number (NIP) and statistical&#13;
      number (REGON) while filing the motion for registration of the&#13;
      company. It is sufficient that in the motion for registration of the&#13;
      company, the applicant indicates that it has not applied for NIP and/or&#13;
      REGON registration and the registration court would automatically&#13;
      assign such numbers to the company during registration process.&#13;
      Therefore, once entered into the National Court Register a company&#13;
      would hold also the NIP and REGON registration numbers, which&#13;
      shortens the registration procedure.&#13;
&#13;
      After registration of the company, the registry court would send the&#13;
      registration data to a newly established central register of tax payers                  PLN 500 for&#13;
      (Centralny Rejestr PodmiotÃ³w - Krajowa Ewidencja PodatnikÃ³w).                          registration and&#13;

                                                                                               PLN 100 for&#13;
      The applicant shall additionally file a NIP-8 form (which contains&#13;
                                                                                               publication&#13;
      supplementary information to those disclosed in the court registration&#13;
      form) with the competent tax office within 21 days from registration of&#13;
      the company in the National Court Register by the registry court. If the&#13;
      applicant wishes to register as the social security contributions payer&#13;
      with ZUS at the same time, it shall file the NIP-8 form within 7 days as&#13;
      of the date on which the registration obligation arose.&#13;
&#13;
      However, the electronic new registration is not used by the majority of&#13;
      firms for various reasons. For instance, the e-registration requires an&#13;
      electronic signature or ePuap as well as the presence of all the&#13;
      shareholders and management board members with electronic&#13;
      signatures or ePuap profile. They all must use the same computer as the&#13;
      same time in order to be able to submit the application. Also, the&#13;
      electronic systems of different agencies are not compatible yet. As per&#13;
      information from the Statistical office, when the KRS sends the&#13;
      information electronically, a clerk has to retype all the information in&#13;
      the system and there is a risk that some errors can happen. Therefore&#13;
      lawyers and entrepreneurs prefer to complete the registration step by&#13;
      step to avoid complications. After registration, they would file directly&#13;
      with the Tax agency a form NIP-8 where they will request the NIP, the&#13;
      REGON and the ZUS (social security). It is much quicker and more&#13;
      reliable than to request these numbers from the KRS&#13;

        Obtain current geodesic map&#13;
&#13;
        Obtaining a current geodesic map is necessary for preparing a&#13;
        building project. According to the Building Code, a building&#13;
        project should consist of an architectural project; a major&#13;
        planning scheme of the plot; declarations of energy, water and&#13;
        sewage, and other suppliers, if applicable; a declaration by the&#13;
        administrator of the public road about the possibility of&#13;
        connecting the plot to the public road; the results, if applicable,&#13;
        of the geological examinations; and a specification of the&#13;
        geotechnical conditions of the property.&#13;
&#13;
        One of these documents, the major planning scheme of the plot,&#13;
        should be corrected by an expert on a copy of the most recent&#13;
        geodetic map. Such a map is collected by the division of the&#13;
   1    County Office (Starostwo) or, as in Warsaw and some other cities,          21 days               PLN 2,000&#13;
        by the relevant division of the city administration. This map is&#13;
        valid for only about 6 months, which explains the need for it to&#13;
        be constantly updated. Once obtained, the map need to be&#13;
        updated by a private surveyor or by the and approved by the&#13;
        local administrative office of surveyors (Municipality of Warsaw).&#13;
&#13;
        In practice majority of companies hire a private surveyor who&#13;
        obtains the map from the municipality (or online) and makes the&#13;
        necessary corrections on the outdated map. This will cost around&#13;
        PLN 2000 which includes administrative fees payable to the&#13;
        municipality.&#13;

      The following documents should be attached to the application:&#13;
      â&#128;¢ Four copies of the building project, with all opinions,&#13;
      adjustments, permits, and other documents required by the&#13;

      The opinions, adjustments, and permits mentioned above should&#13;
      be acquired by BuildCo or its attorney. In practice, they are&#13;
      obtained by the architect who prepares the project.&#13;
&#13;
      The building project should be accompanied by a document&#13;
      certifying that the project designer is registered as a building&#13;
      expert. The decision on the conditions of building in a certain&#13;
      area is obligatory when the area is not covered by a binding&#13;
      special layout plan.&#13;

      to PLN 539.00 for issuance of a building permit (PLN 1.00 per sq.&#13;
      m., but no more than PLN 539.00) and PLN 47.00 for approval of&#13;
      the building project. PLN 2.50 is added for the cost of wire&#13;
      transfer. Thus, the total cost is about PLN 588.50. In case the&#13;
      application is to be signed and filed by an authorized&#13;
      representative, an authorization should also be attached.&#13;
&#13;
      The legally allowed time for making an administrative decision&#13;
      granting a building permit is 30 days (Administrative Code,&#13;
      General Administrative Regulations, Art. 35.3), but Article 35&#13;
      Section 6 of the construction law provides 65 days for resolving&#13;
      difficult cases. Even so, the administration frequently reviews a&#13;
      case for a few months as it can sometimes requests many new&#13;
      documents and an explanation from the applicant and can&#13;
      suspend proceeding with the application until these documents&#13;
      and explanations are submitted.&#13;
&#13;
      Formally, the time to validate the administrative decision is 14&#13;
      days from the date it was delivered to the parties. In practice, the&#13;
      investor should expect that other parties, such as neighbors and&#13;
      ecological organizations, will appeal against this decision. Appeal&#13;
      cases may take a few years.&#13;
&#13;
      Therefore, making an administrative decision can take from 60&#13;
      days (legally) to 365 days (in practice), while validation takes&#13;
      from 14 days (legally, and with no trouble arising) to 4 years (in&#13;
      case of appeals).&#13;
&#13;
      Since February 1, 2013, the Mayorâ&#128;&#153;s office must enter the date of&#13;

&#13;
        The application to the utility can be submitted online, however, the&#13;
        following documents are required: type of building, the service&#13;
        requirement, the commencement date (date this warehouse will starts its&#13;
        activity), the detailed information on the client (REGON/NIP/Bank&#13;
        account), and a copy of the building permit. No external inspection is&#13;
        required.&#13;
&#13;
        After processing the application, RWE will send the technical conditions&#13;
        and a draft contract showing the amount to be paid â&#128;&#147; the connection         30 calendar days       PLN 8,566.6&#13;

        fees (the connection fees include the cost of design, all the materials and&#13;
        labor cost). If the client agrees and signed this contract, then RWE must&#13;
        by law, send this contract to the regulator for approval of the connection&#13;
        fees. Once the regulator approves the connection fees, the contract is&#13;
        returned to RWE where it is signed as well and then it becomes a binding&#13;

      RWE hires an engineering company (surveyors, designers) to do the&#13;
      electrical design and to obtain all approvals and decisions required by&#13;
      law. This engineering company is usually different from a company / an&#13;
      electrician which is hired by customer to do the design of internal wiring&#13;
      in his building or on his plot. The designer will also contact the client to&#13;
      discuss where the collection box should be located (i.e. the work on the&#13;
      property itself is done by the client)&#13;
&#13;
      Once the design has been approved by RWE, the engineering company&#13;
      submits all documents related to the construction of connection to the&#13;
2     municipality. For instance, for a 140kVA power connection, an                  96 calendar days        PLN 0&#13;
      underground cable is necessary and in order to lay the cables, the&#13;
      engineering company needs to get municipal approval for the external&#13;
      connection works.&#13;
&#13;
      Meanwhile, RWE hires a construction company to build the connection in&#13;
      the field and construct the connection including excavation and the use&#13;
      of drilling machine (faster and recommended technology) to lay 150 m&#13;
      low-voltage cable in the ground.&#13;

      them to the connection box. All work on the property of the warehouse&#13;
      is to be done by the private contractor of the client that is pulling the&#13;
      cables from the warehouse to the connection box (installed by RWE, with&#13;
3     the connection box ready to receive those cables with stops to prevent          1 calendar day         PLN 0&#13;
      any further surge). Once this connection is done, RWE will give to the&#13;
      Owner a protocol that the connection is finished. This protocol is&#13;
      necessary to sign the supply contract&#13;

      owner has the protocol provided by RWE stating that the connection is&#13;
      finished. Once the signing is done, the supplier will inform RWE directly&#13;
      that they have been chosen by the client to be his/her electricity provider&#13;

and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;
qualitative information on the mechanisms put in           duration and frequency of power outages in the largest&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost&#13;
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary&#13;
requirements than does the number of documents required.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

 Indicator     Answer                                          Explanation&#13;
                                   Under Article 21 of the Law on Bankruptcy and Reorganization, debtor's&#13;
                              management is obligated to file for bankruptcy within 2 weeks of the date when&#13;
                                the debtor becomes insolvent. Although the bankruptcy law has provisions on&#13;
                              reorganization, in practice, such proceedings are very rare and most bankruptcy&#13;
Proceedin      liquidation&#13;
                              cases are resolved through liquidation. Once the hotel management commences&#13;
g&#13;
                               bankruptcy proceedings, the judge will have to decide whether to proceed with&#13;
                               liquidation or with reorganization. The judge will most likely order the opening&#13;
                                                          of liquidation proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Because the value of an operating hotel is higher than selling its assets&#13;
                            piecemeal, it is most likely that BizBank and Mirage management will agree that&#13;
Outcome       going concern&#13;
                            it is in both of their best interest for the hotel to continue operating, which will&#13;
                                                       enable sale as a going concern.&#13;
&#13;
                             It will take 2-3 weeks for Mirage to prepare the bankruptcy application. After the&#13;
                                 application is submitted, it will take approximately 2 months for the court to&#13;
                              appoint the judges and for the judges to review the case and issue a declaration&#13;
                              of bankruptcy. After the declaration is issued, it must be published in the official&#13;
                               gazette and at least one local newspaper (14 days). After the announcement is&#13;
                                  published, it may take up to 2 months to hold the first hearing with all the&#13;
                                  creditors present. The participants are likely to agree that the hotel should&#13;
                              continue operating and the court will appoint an administrator to supervise the&#13;
                                operations (up to 2 months). The creditors will then submit their claims to the&#13;
                                administrator, who will prepare a list of creditors to be approved by the court.&#13;
 Time (in&#13;
                   3.0       This process can take up to 11 months. After that, the court will likely decide that&#13;
years)&#13;
                             the company should be liquidated and will appoint a liquidator (up to 4 months).&#13;
                                   The liquidator must inventory and appraise the assets, which is a lengthy&#13;
                                   procedure and may take up to a year, because all participants can express&#13;
                              opinions on the value of the assets and several appraisers may need to be hired&#13;
                                  to satisfy the objections of the debtor and creditors. After all the assets are&#13;
                             appraised, the liquidator will organize an auction for the sale of assets. Usually, at&#13;
                               least two auctions will take place, because most buyers will wait for the second&#13;
                               auction, as the price at the second auction will be dropped by 30%. That is why&#13;
                               this process of auctioning off the assets may take up to 4 months. BizBank can&#13;
                                       receive its portion of the sale proceeds within 30 days of the sale.&#13;
&#13;
                              The costs will depend on how disputed the insolvency claims are. Attorneys' fees&#13;
 Cost (% of                     will be one of the main expenses (3-6%), as well as fees of the administrator&#13;

RESOLVING INSOLVENCY&#13;
A well-balanced bankruptcy system distinguishes                   change. Many recent reforms of bankruptcy laws have&#13;
companies that are financially distressed but                     been aimed at helping more of the viable businesses&#13;
economically viable from inefficient companies that               survive. What insolvency reforms has Doing Business&#13;

doing business ranking, which is based on the distance&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

practice across the entire sample of 36 indicators for 10     extreme outliers in the distributions of the rescaled data&#13;
Doing Business topics (the labor market regulation            for most component indicators (very few economies&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;
score for the total tax rateâ&#128;&#148;and therefore on the&#13;
distance to frontier score for paying taxesâ&#128;&#148;for&#13;
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Poland
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Poland.
            To allow for useful comparison, the profile also provides
            data for other selected economies (comparator economies) for
            each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the 13th edition in a
            series of annual reports measuring the regulations that
            enhance business activity and those that constrain it.
            Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business; for
            2015 Poland ranks 25. A high ease of doing business ranking
            means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the
            starting and operation of a local firm. Doing Business
            presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and
            the protection of property rights that can be compared
            across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over
            time. Doing Business sheds light on how easy or difficult it
            is for a local entrepreneur to open and run a small to
            medium-size business when complying with relevant
            regulations. It measures and tracks changes in regulations
            affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a business: starting
            a business, dealing with construction permits, getting
            electricity, registering property, getting credit,
            protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across
            borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency and labor
            market regulation. The data in this report are current as of
            June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes indicators, which
            cover the period from January to December 2014).
