As African economies face difficult global conditions combined with domestic challenges, Sub-Saha-&#13;

World Bank projections. The end of the commodity price super cycle â&#136;&#146; with a substantial drop in the&#13;
price of oil, copper and iron ore; a slowdown of the Chinese economy; and tightening global financial&#13;
conditions underpin the deceleration in growth.&#13;

                        The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Africa Pulse published in October 2015 highlights that continued&#13;
                        dependency on oil and commodity exports has left the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region&#13;
                        vulnerable to periodic shocks from the prices of international commodities. The region&#13;
                        remains a net exporter of oil, minerals, and agricultural commodities. Specifically, ener-&#13;

                                           go to China. Central Africa Republic, Eritrea, Mali, South Africa, and Zimbabwe have&#13;

                                           such as poor agricultural yields due to drought (e.g. Zambia), power supply bottlenecks&#13;

&#13;
                                           Weakening oil and mineral prices have propagated a deterioration of the terms of trade&#13;
                                           of oil-exporting and mineral-rich economies. This has led to weakened current account&#13;
                                           positions for most of these economies (figure 2). For example, in Nigeria, the current&#13;
                                           account deficit widened from 0.6% of GDP in Q4 2014 to 3.6% of GDP in Q1 2015. In&#13;
                                           Zambia, the current account deficit deteriorated to 3.4% of GDP in 2014 from 0.8% of&#13;
                                           GDP in 2013. Furthermore, in countries such as Angola, Nigeria, and Zambia, where oil&#13;
                                           and mineral exports contribute to part of the government revenue, the fiscal deficit has&#13;
                                           widened (figure 2). However, in other cases, fiscal imbalances have been worsened by&#13;

                                           iture on infrastructure, and high expenditure on subsides. In countries such as Ghana&#13;
                                           and Zambia, these fiscal deficits have been financed by borrowing in the international&#13;
                                           debt markets, resulting in substantial increases in the debt to GDP ratios.&#13;

                                           The medium-term growth outlook of the region is subject to several downside risks.&#13;

                                           large external and fiscal imbalances are expected to be the most vulnerable to these&#13;
                                           factors. In this regard, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms can potentially help&#13;
                                           countries to contain the effects of these shocks. Domestically, the risks include politi-&#13;
                                           cal instability in Burundi and South Sudan, and security risks caused by insurgency in&#13;

                                           ment investment in infrastructure and other built-in buffers to finance policy responses&#13;
                                           to enable growth. Overall, the analysis shows that before the current bout of global&#13;

B. THE STATE OF THE ZAMBIAN ECONOMY&#13;
Zambia faces its toughest economic challenges in at least a decade. The economy has come un-&#13;
der strain in 2015 as external headwinds and domestic pressures have intensified. Growth of the&#13;
economy is expected to drop beneath 4% in 2015 for the first time since 1998, resulting in only&#13;
marginal growth of per capita incomes. The external headwinds include slower regional and global&#13;
growth (crucially in China who purchase 40% of global copper production) and a US dollar that has&#13;
strengthened considerably against the kwacha. Domestic pressures include a power crisis impacting&#13;
on all sectors of the economy, repeat fiscal deficits that have reduced investor confidence, and low&#13;
and poorly-timed rains that have reduced the agricultural incomes of 62% of the population living in&#13;
poverty.&#13;
                        The Zambian economy grew at an average annual rate of 6.4% between 2010 and&#13;
                        2014, above the overall growth rate of SSA and on the back of high copper prices,&#13;

                                           borrowing and make it even harder for firms and individuals to access credit. In a 2013&#13;

                                           economy has slowed. Tax revenues will end the year around 13.8% of GDP, slightly&#13;
                                           above target, but non-tax revenues (that include royalties) will end 2015 at 3.5% below&#13;

                           In October 2015, the government presented its 2016 national budget, aimed at: â&#128;&#156;Fiscal&#13;
                           Consolidation to Safeguard Our Past Achievements and Secure a Prosperous Future for&#13;
                           Allâ&#128;&#157;. The Minister of Finance called for moderation of the expansionary fiscal stance&#13;
                           of the past four years given global economic conditions. Typically, fiscal consolidation&#13;
                           involves lower expenditure, but in this fiscal plan, expenditure was to increase to 25.8%&#13;
Substantial new            GDP, leaving all the hard work with improving domestic revenue collection. Plans to&#13;
expenditure&#13;
                           increase domestic revenue to 20.4% in 2016 (from 17.8% in 2015), perhaps possible&#13;
pressures have also&#13;
                           over the medium term, are extremely optimistic. Especially given the recent slowdown&#13;
emerged since the&#13;
budget, including&#13;
                           in the mining sector and deteriorating economic conditions in the second half of 2015.&#13;
increasing debt&#13;
service costs.             Substantial new expenditure pressures have also emerged since the budget, including&#13;
                           increasing debt service costs and a planned increase in emergency power imports. If&#13;
                           the government is to reduce the fiscal deficit in 2016, the framework will require close&#13;
                           review. At a press conference on November 26, 2015, the President of Zambia an-&#13;
                           nounced some â&#128;&#152;austerity measuresâ&#128;&#153; including expenditure reductions, and reiterated&#13;
                           the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to cost-reflective tariffs for electricity and to removing&#13;
                           the subsidy on fuel. The expenditure measures included now new capital projects, a re-&#13;
                           view of government emoluments and benefits (including cars), and restricted overseas&#13;
                           and domestic travel. No time frame was given, but the announced measures would&#13;
                           help in the move towards fiscal sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Box    Huge recent subsidy bills for government&#13;
 	1      When asked about fuel subsidies, many people respond that they are cost-reflective prices and no 	&#13;
 	       subsidies are in place in Zambia. However, a consequence of the rapidly depreciating kwacha has&#13;
 been a mismatch between revenues from electricity tariffs and pump prices (paid in kwacha) and the cost&#13;
 of supply of emergency electricity and fuel (paid in US dollar). This leaves the Ministry of Finance having to&#13;
 pay the difference.&#13;
&#13;
 The Energy Regulation Board (ERB) sets wholesale and retail fuel prices according to a formula that marks&#13;
 up the landed price of each shipment of oil as it arrives in Dar es Salaam by the cost of transporting, refin-&#13;
 ing, and distributing fuel in Zambia. The stated objective of ERBâ&#128;&#153;s cost-plus pricing model is to ensure that&#13;
 all costs relevant to procurement are recovered through sales of petroleum products.&#13;
&#13;
 Fuel pump prices were increased on July 13, 2015, but between then and end-November, the kwacha-US&#13;
 dollar exchange rate depreciated by 31%, and no changes have been made by the ERB. This meant that the&#13;
 government had to contribute US$50 million in October alone to cover the cost of supplying fuel. In Octo-&#13;
 ber and November, prices were less than US$1 per liter, an event that last occurred beyond the memory of&#13;
 most fuel consumers. These expenditures are not pro-poor and are arguably unaffordable as the economy&#13;
 slows down and the cost of borrowing increases.&#13;

                                           Public debt looms large&#13;
                                           Large exchange rate depreciations carry the risk of balance sheet effects, especially&#13;
                                           where there is substantial offshore foreign currency borrowing by the government and&#13;
                                           corporations. Foreign currency risks have become a reality in Zambia in 2015, as the&#13;
                                           weakening kwacha has increased the level of external debt and cost of servicing the&#13;
                                           borrowing.&#13;
The repeat fiscal&#13;
deficits of the past                       The repeat fiscal deficits of the past four years have been financed by external non-&#13;
four years have                            concessional borrowing. In July 2015, Zambia issued its third Eurobond for US$1.25&#13;
been financed                              billion (with an average tenor of 11 year) at a considerably higher cost (the yield at issue&#13;
by external non-                           was 9.375%). These Eurobond issues now total US$3 billion and have sharply increased&#13;
concessional                               overall debt levels. The recent and rapid depreciation has also pushed the kwacha cost&#13;
borrowing.                                 of repaying and servicing this external debt much higher. In consequence, public debt&#13;
                                           is now around 55% of GDP, representing a near doubling of debt levels (as measured in&#13;
                                           local currency) since 2012, raising important issues of debt sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
                                           In light of the economic difficulties and deterioration of fiscal metrics, Moodyâ&#128;&#153;s down-&#13;
                                           graded Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s government issuer rating from B2 to B1, and its outlook from negative&#13;
                                           to stable (25 September 2015), thereby aligning their rating with those of other rating&#13;
                                           agencies. The consequence of higher levels and lower ratings is that access to interna-&#13;
                                           tional debt markets, where opportunities are already narrowing for frontier markets,&#13;
                                           will be more costly for Zambia in 2016 and going forward.&#13;

                                           deficits. Trade deficits have been recorded in each of the first three quarters in 2015,&#13;
                                           led by a decline in the amount and value of copper exported to international com-&#13;

                        The BoZâ&#128;&#153;s November 2015 monetary policy statement highlighted a widening of the&#13;
                        current account deficit in Q3 to US$401.0 million from US$305.9 million recorded in&#13;
                        Q2, on account of higher import related service payments and the increase in income&#13;

The benefits of         The cost of imports increased in Q2 and Q3 2015, following the depreciation of the&#13;

                        fall below the poverty line) is far higher for the rural population than their urban coun-&#13;
                        terparts (20% and 3.7%, respectively, as of 2010). Real income growth between 2006&#13;
                        and 2010 was greatest among those with higher incomes and relatively weak for those&#13;
                        with lower incomes. Incomes of the poor have not been growing rapidly enough, or at&#13;

                        modest real consumption growth below 1%. As a result, although poverty rates were&#13;
                        declining until the mid-2000s, poverty in Zambia remains high, with an estimated 62%&#13;
                        of Zambians living on less than US$1.90 per day (2011 PPP). Forthcoming results of the&#13;

C. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, RISKS AND POLICY CHALLENGES&#13;
The outlook for 2016 has become more somber following announcements of expected mine clo-&#13;
sures, the severity of the power crisis and the rapid depreciation of the kwacha. Given the external&#13;
and domestic challenges, we expect GDP growth to drop to 3 to 3.5% this year and next, before re-&#13;
turning to potential (5 to 6%) by 2018, as copper prices stabilize and domestic pressures ease. Tough&#13;
action is required in 2016 to curb runaway expenditures, double digit inflation and growing twin&#13;
deficits. Fiscal policy should be put center stage and efforts made to shift the country back onto a&#13;
sustainable fiscal path.&#13;
&#13;
                        Medium-term outlook&#13;
                        The outlook for the Zambian economy is underpinned by three main trends.&#13;
                        i. The current low price of copper, on which the economy depends for revenue&#13;
                        and foreign currency, will pressure fiscal and current account balances. World&#13;
Reflecting the&#13;
                        Bank forecasts suggest commodity prices, including copper, are likely to stay in&#13;

                        the doldrums throughout 2016, but should start to pick up in 2017 and beyond.&#13;
and domestic&#13;
pressures, the&#13;
                        ii. There is huge uncertainty about whether persistent and growing fiscal deficits can&#13;
expectation is          be reined in. Zambia has been able to issue three Eurobonds in four years to fund its&#13;
that GDP growth         exuberance, but as markets tighten and Zambian debt levels have soared, the costs of&#13;
will remain in the      borrowing will remain much higher than when the Eurobonds were issued in 2012 or&#13;
region of 3 to 3.5%     2014.&#13;
in 2016.                iii. The severity of the power crisis, and the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ability to mitigate it by sourc-&#13;
                        ing emergency power and ensuring the cost is affordable via tariffs that better reflect&#13;
                        the rising cost of supplying electricity.&#13;
&#13;
                        Reflecting on the external headwinds and domestic pressures, the expectation is that&#13;
                        GDP growth will remain in the region of 3 to 3.5% in 2016, before reaching potential&#13;
                        (between 5 and 6%) in 2017 and 2018, as new power generation capacity comes fully&#13;
                        online and global copper prices stabilize. Despite the current problems, long-term in-&#13;
                        vestment in the mineral and non-mineral sectors in Zambia remains attractive.&#13;

                                                                                                                                            13&#13;

&#13;
                                           The government remains committed to a target of single digit inflation, set as part of&#13;
                                           the 2016 budget, but this appears ambitious given the recent rapid depreciation of the&#13;
                                           kwacha. However, given the extent of the recent depreciation, it is likely that prices will&#13;

external.                                  The outlook is subject to downside risks, both domestic and external. Externally, lower&#13;

                                           rates, would also likely add volatility to the exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The main domestic risks are threefold. First, that the power crisis will worsen. This could&#13;
                                           occur via delays in new generation coming online or a further reduction of generation&#13;
                                           capacity at the main hydropower plants, serving to reduce both mining and non-mining&#13;
                                           activity, increase joblessness and push the economy into contraction. Second, a dete-&#13;
                                           rioration of confidence in the economy, leading to further weakening of the currency&#13;
                                           and increased levels of inflation. This might result in the absence of measures to cur-&#13;
                                           tail runaway expenditure, especially in the run-up to the 2016 elections, that would&#13;
                                           make any substantial dent in the fiscal deficit. In this event, external financing would&#13;
                                           also become more costly and would put further pressure, via increased debt service&#13;
                                           obligations, on the 2016 budget and for years to come. Lastly, another bad harvest&#13;
                                           that serves to increase food prices and reduce rural and agricultural incomes, with the&#13;
                                           greatest impact falling on the poorest households.&#13;

the globe.                                 but in Zambia, no savings were made or stabilization measures carried out when the&#13;
                                           economy was prospering. Furthermore, debt levels have soared following repeat non-&#13;
                                           concessional borrowing making it more expensive to borrow from international debt&#13;

&#13;
                                           The 2016 budget puts all the pressure on revenue, but year-on-year increases to public&#13;
                                           expenditure, funded by borrowing, should be center stage. Large fiscal deficits and inef-&#13;

                                           macroeconomic and wider development objectives.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Any adjustment should involve a shift in spending priorities that supports both the ef-&#13;

                                           is difficult to achieve, there are obvious areas for attention including the growing cost&#13;
                                           of fuel subsides. Policy announcements have been made for cost-reflective electricity&#13;
                                           tariffs and fuel prices, but the reality is a huge outflow of subsidy from the Ministry of&#13;

D. THE ELECTRICITY CHALLENGE&#13;
&#13;
Economic progress since 2000, driven by mining production and services, has substantially increased&#13;
the demand for electricity in Zambia. A growing shortfall in supply has been exacerbated in 2015 by&#13;
a reduction in hydroelectric generation due to low water levels at the countryâ&#128;&#153;s main reservoirs. This&#13;
has increased power outages and impacted on all aspects of the economy, contributing to slower&#13;
economic growth in 2015 and higher production costs.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s economy has expanded by an average of 6.4% per year between 2010 and&#13;
                                           2014, and 7.4% over the last decade. This economic expansion has lifted the demand&#13;
                                           for electricity by 4% per annum over the same period. With very little new generation&#13;
                                           capacity being brought online in the past 30 years, Zambia has been experiencing a&#13;
                                           power deficit over the past 4-5 years, characterized by power outages commonly re-&#13;
                                           ferred to as load-shedding.&#13;
Approximately&#13;
95% of generation&#13;
                                           Approximately 95% of generation capacity is linked to hydropower plants, hence the&#13;
capacity is linked&#13;
to hydropower&#13;
                                           electricity supply is heavily dependent on hydrology. This puts the country at risk in the&#13;
plants, hence the                          event of drought, more so recently as the gap between generation and demand has&#13;
electricity supply is                      closed.&#13;
heavily dependent&#13;
on hydrology.                              The mining industry consumes the majority of Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s electricity (55%) using it not&#13;
                                           only for mining itself, but also processing (e.g. concentrating, smelting and refining) and&#13;
                                           other associated services such as water pumping. Most mines in the Copperbelt Prov-&#13;
                                           ince receive their power via the Copperbelt Energy Corporation (CEC) based on prices&#13;
                                           agreed in long-term Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) that run back-to-back with Bulk&#13;
                                           Supply Agreements (BSAs) between CEC and ZESCO Limited. For legacy reasons, these&#13;
                                           agreements are not overseen by the ERB. The ERB does however set tariffs for other&#13;
                                           consumer categories and provides its consent to ZESCOâ&#128;&#153;s other long-term bulk power&#13;
                                           agreements.&#13;
&#13;
                                           While installed capacity, measured in Mega Watts (MW), has been higher than existing&#13;
                                           peak demand, available energy generation, measured in Giga Watt Hours (GWh) and&#13;
                                           which has an approximate linear relationship to the water used, has remained below&#13;
                                           the countryâ&#128;&#153;s total energy demand (figure 11). This has been exacerbated in 2015 due&#13;
                                           to low water levels in the main reservoirs used for hydroelectric generation (box 2).&#13;

                                           mand, there has been very little improvement in generation capacity. Until 2006, Zam-&#13;
                                           bia had surplus power and this partly explains why prior to the 360MW Kariba North&#13;

  In the 1970s and following the commissioning of Kafue Gorge, Zambia experienced a period of power&#13;
  surplus, during which power was sold and exported to Zimbabwe and South Africa. Falling and low copper&#13;
  prices and a lack of investment (mines were nationalized in 1972) meant there was reduced demand for&#13;
  power. Mining firms are the biggest users of power and as production began to pick up in the late 1990s,&#13;
  and the economy grew robustly, the power surplus slowly decreased.&#13;

E. ZAMBIAâ&#128;&#153;S POWER CRISIS&#13;
Since July 2015, ZESCO has increased the extent of rolling black-outs (load-shedding) to at least 8&#13;
hours per day on a rotational basis for the majority of its household, commercial and industrial con-&#13;
sumers. And although they are not subject to rotational load-shedding, ZESCO has requested the&#13;
mining industry to curtail its load by 30%. This is in order to manage a power deficit of around 591&#13;
MW each month (September to December 2015), representing approximately 34% of demand.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The decision by ZESCO to limit electricity generation is due to the historically low wa-&#13;
                                           ter levels at the countryâ&#128;&#153;s reservoirs (including Kariba, Itezhi Tezhi and Kafue Gorge)&#13;
                                           that store water for hydroelectric generation. Prior to the start of the increased load-&#13;
                                           shedding in July, ZESCO generation capacity was in the range of 1,800 â&#128;&#147; 2,000 MW. The&#13;
The reason for the                         reason for the low water levels is a combination of lower rainfall (during the 2014-15&#13;
low water levels                           rainy season) and increased water usage.&#13;
is a combination&#13;
of lower rainfall&#13;
                                           Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s and Zimbabweâ&#128;&#153;s water allocation at Kariba dam is regulated by the Zambezi&#13;
(during the 2014-15&#13;
                                           River Authority (ZRA) and in both 2013 and 2014, ZESCO exceeded its allocation by 5%&#13;
rainy season) and&#13;
                                           and 22% respectively. The commissioning of the Kariba North Bank Extension project in&#13;
increased water&#13;
usage.                                     2014 contributed to increased water use at the Kariba reservoir and the reservoir has&#13;
                                           not reached its maximum retention levels since 2010. Water levels in the reservoirs will&#13;
                                           recover somewhat during the 2015 -16 rain season, assuming usage according to al-&#13;
                                           location, but it will take several years of rainfall and balanced usage for them to recover&#13;
                                           to maximum levels.&#13;
&#13;
                                           As of mid-November 2015, most areas of Zambia had experienced low rainfall and if&#13;
                                           this trend continues (the El NiÃ±o is expected to last into Q1 2016), there will be only&#13;
                                           limited recovery in 2016. If, however, reservoir levels continue to drop, ZESCO may be&#13;
                                           forced to curtail generation at the Kafue Gorge and at Kariba North Bank (including the&#13;
                                           extension) power stations even more.&#13;

F. MANAGING THE COST OF MITIGATION&#13;
Power is essential for the Zambian economy to function. Despite new generation projects, the mod-&#13;
elling of different hydrology conditions shows that even in a wet (above average rainfall) scenario,&#13;
current power shortages will continue through to at least 2018. For 2016, the authorities have made&#13;
the difficult choice to increase the import of expensive emergency options. This puts huge pressure&#13;
on the budget at current tariff rates, in tough economic conditions, and unless tariffs are revised&#13;
upwards, the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s subsidy of the sector will rise dramatically and will be unaffordable. At&#13;
November 2015 tariff rates, the government will need to provide ZESCO with an additional US$ 340&#13;
million in 2016 to meet the cost of emergency power. However, the financing requirement can be&#13;
substantially reduced if the average tariff is increased.&#13;
&#13;
                                           At present there are six power plants at various stages of preparation/development,&#13;
At present&#13;
there are six                              some of which have been in the pipeline for more than a decade. The total capacity of&#13;
power plants at                            these plants is about 1,730 MW (table 3). Generation of between 150 and 300 MW is ex-&#13;
various stages                             pected in 2016 from Maamba Collieries (depending on the speed of project completion&#13;
of preparation/                            and the quality of coal used), along with 70 MW from Itezhi Tezhi (60% of its potential&#13;
development, some                          capacity due to low reservoir levels) starting in early to mid-2016. The largest, Kafue&#13;
of which have been                         Gorge Lower (750 MW), has gone through several procurement/contracting phases,&#13;
in the pipeline                            and has recently been contracted at a cost of US$ 2 billion and is scheduled to be com-&#13;
for more than a                            missioned in 2020. The remaining three projects are negotiating power purchase and&#13;

&#13;
                                           In addition, there are good prospects for solar generation in 2016 and beyond (box 3).&#13;
                                           The International Development Corporation (IDC) has been working to attract private&#13;
                                           sector partners for two 50MW solar PV projects, with support from the World Bank&#13;
                                           Group as transaction advisor. These projects should provide a diversified form of gen-&#13;
                                           eration in early 2017.&#13;
&#13;
                                           There is also potential for thermal power generation by Independent Power Producers&#13;
                                           (IPP) for 200 MW worth of generation over the coming years, assuming the potential&#13;
                                           revenues, partly determined by the level of electricity tariffs, are sufficient to attract&#13;
                                           interest and that other constraints such weak management of the tendering process&#13;
                                           can be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The prospect of solar and thermal generation in the next few years will help diver-&#13;

                                            Despite these projects, the modelling of different hydrology conditions shows that&#13;
                                            even in a wet (above average rainfall) scenario, current power shortages will continue&#13;
                                            through 2018. In a dry (lower than average rainfall) scenario, power shortages may&#13;
                                            continue through 2020. It should be noted that the assumptions in these scenarios do&#13;

 Box    Scaling solar in Zambia&#13;
   3    Scaling Solar is an open, competitive and transparent approach that facilitates the rapid development&#13;
 of privately-owned, utility-scale solar PV projects in sub-Saharan Africa. It is capable of rapid implementa-&#13;
 tion support, and offers a â&#128;&#152;one-stop-shopâ&#128;&#153; package of advisory services, contracts, financing, guarantees and&#13;
 insurance. This enables governments and utilities to procure solar power transparently and at the lowest&#13;
 possible cost.&#13;
&#13;
 The government and IDC hope that this initial 100 MW procurement round for solar generation will ulti-&#13;
 mately lead to a rapid scale-up of solar PV capacity, forming a natural complement to Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s extensive&#13;
 hydro resources. If they and the other public sector stakeholders adhere to the risk allocation under Scaling&#13;
 Solar, it is hoped that these projects will qualify for WBG financing, political risk insurance and partial risk&#13;
 guarantees.&#13;

                           Emergency power imports in 2016&#13;
                           Notwithstanding the risk that ZESCO may be forced to curtail generation completely&#13;
                           at the Kafue Gorge and at Kariba North Bank, reduced generation is likely from these&#13;
                           sources (assuming water quotas are followed) for at least the first half of 2016 until&#13;
                           rainfall helps replenish the reservoirs. Maamba Collieries and Itezhi Tezhi, when com-&#13;

                                            Electricity tariffs&#13;
                                            The issue of electricity tariffs has been a longstanding one and there has long been&#13;
                                            discussion of moving towards costs-reflective tariffs. In 2008, the tariff was increased&#13;
                                            33% with the financial viability of the power supply in mind (Zambian tariffs were some&#13;
                                            of the lowest across the continent), but the prices have not been inflation linked and&#13;
                                            have reduced considerably in real terms.&#13;
&#13;
                                            On 1 July, 2014, ZESCO was permitted by the ERB to raise tariffs on all customer cat-&#13;
                                            egories except mining. Accordingly, commercial tariffs were increased by 15.4% and&#13;
                                            residential consumersâ&#128;&#153; tariffs by 24.6%. This followed a four-year period from August&#13;
                                            2010 where no adjustments were made despite cumulative inflation of 28%. Attempts&#13;
                                            have also been made to increase tariffs paid by mining firms to cover the actual cost of&#13;
                                            supply but many hurdles have been encountered.&#13;
&#13;
                                            The cost of emergency power in 2016 will substantially increase the cost of supplying&#13;
                                            electricity as it has in the second half of 2015. In July 2015, and to improve the financial&#13;
                                            sustainability of ZECSO, the government stated its intention to revise electricity tariffs to&#13;
                                            take the cost of supply into account. This government statement was repeated several&#13;
                                            times since July 2015, but as of end-November 2015, no action had been taken.&#13;
&#13;
                                            To move towards this goal, ZESCO applied to the ERB to increase most of the various&#13;
                                            non-mining tariffs and fixed charges from between 167 and 248%. Public consultations&#13;
                                            were held and as of end-November, no final decision had been made. Despite the large&#13;
                                            changes to some tariff lines, the proposal kept the R1 tariff (a â&#128;&#152;life-lineâ&#128;&#153; tariff aimed at&#13;
                                            providing lower pricing to low-income consumers) at US Cents (USc) 1.5 per KWh and&#13;
                                            increased the threshold to receive this tariff from 100 Kwh up to 300 KWh of consump-&#13;
                                            tion. The aim of this tariff is to protect low-income residential consumers, but the move&#13;
                                            to allowing up to 300 KWh will include many of the non-poor as well. In addition, ZESCO,&#13;
                                            CEC and the mining industry began discussions to renegotiate the agreements under&#13;
                                            which bulk power sales to the mining industry are governed in order that they include&#13;
                                            the full cost of emergency power imports.&#13;
&#13;
                                            A substantial increase in tariffs will be required to meet the cost of supply in 2016 and&#13;
                                            any gap between revenues and the costs of supply will need to be met by the govern-&#13;
                                            ment. Average tariffs, including both mining and non-mining, are currently (i.e. prior to&#13;
                                            any increase) estimated at between USc 5 and 6 per KWh. At this tariff rate, the govern-&#13;
                                            ment will need to provide ZESCO with an additional US$340 million in 2016 to meet&#13;
                                            the cost of emergency power. However, the financing requirement can be substantially&#13;
                                            reduced if the average tariff is increased and remains at that level (figure 13). For ex-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                      Key to note is that an increase in tariffs to reflective levels is necessary but not suffi-&#13;
                      cient to increase private investment in electricity generation in Zambia. There are many&#13;
                      other hurdles to overcome as well. Management and regulation of the sector have&#13;
                      been improving, but there is still substantial work to do. Particular efforts are needed&#13;
                      to improve sector planning and the procurement processes for large power projects.&#13;
&#13;
                      The impact of load-shedding&#13;

output and            growth in 2016. The impact of load-shedding is a key driver of the decline, along with&#13;
redundancies          the external headwinds and domestic pressures being faced.&#13;

industrial sectors.   factures are reporting increased costs of production, as they are forced to run costly&#13;
                      generators or switch shifts to when they have electricity (extra pay is often needed for&#13;
                      night shifts) and many declare they are only meeting between 30 and 40% of scheduled&#13;
                      production. Firms engaging in complex procedures (some machines are designed to&#13;
                      run 24 hours and require 3-4 hours of heating before use) and those requiring refriger-&#13;
                      ation are suffering particularly badly. The mining sector, already impacted on by lower&#13;
                      copper prices, has announced closures, laid-off 7,700 workers and postponed invest-&#13;
                      ment. Load-shedding of 30% and increasing costs of electricity have further weighed on&#13;
                      mine profitability and production.&#13;
&#13;
                      Added to the economic costs are the social and environmental impacts of the power&#13;
                      crisis. It becomes much harder to provide quality health care and education if hospitals,&#13;
                      schools, clinics and universities are experiencing electricity power outages. The For-&#13;
                      estry Department has reported an increase in land degradation as load-shedding has&#13;
                      become worse. The cost of replanting trees and soil degradation must be considered in&#13;
                      any assessment of impacts. In 2015, 32.9% of households in Zambia report using char-&#13;
                      coal for cooking and 50.7% report using firewood. Only 16.0% report typically cooking&#13;
                      with electricity, but a good proportion of those cooking on electricity will have switched&#13;
                      to using charcoal, or LPG where available, when load-shedding has denied them power.&#13;
                      Zambia produces LPG at the Indeni refinery, but 80% is exported. Encouraging and fa-&#13;
                      cilitating the use of LPG would help reduce the demand for electricity and help protect&#13;
                      the forest cover around urban areas.&#13;

G. GRADUATING TO SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY&#13;
The new generation capacity and emergency measures for 2016 will help in mitigating the impact of&#13;
the power crisis in the coming year, but global experience shows there is no substitute for effective&#13;
planning. Furthermore, Zambia may again face a similar crisis in the near future if structural weak-&#13;
nesses in the sector are not adequately addressed. There remains a need to shift from being reactive&#13;
to anticipatory or preemptive in dealing with reduced generation capacity. Additionally, the need to&#13;
increase access to electricity in the country should not be neglected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           The current power crisis, which impacts considerably on the economy, should be used&#13;
                                           to correct policy and regulatory anomalies that prevent the sector from achieving its&#13;

to ensure an&#13;

adequate, quality&#13;
                                           supply requires a robust planning function. Zambia should develop and update regu-&#13;
and reliable&#13;
electricity supply                         larly, e.g. every two years, a Least Cost Power Development Plan (LCPDP) that lays out&#13;
requires a robust                          the investments required in all the segments of the power sector i.e. generation, trans-&#13;
planning function.                         mission and distribution. For generation, the LCPDP should contain a pipeline of pro-&#13;
                                           jects ranked by cost i.e. the most economically and financially viable projects should be&#13;
                                           developed first. The LCPDP process should be anchored by a load-forecast that is also&#13;
                                           routinely updated and, given Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s dependency on hydro, the relevant hydrological&#13;
                                           modelling to guide the extent to which the generation mix should be diversified.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Planning on its own is however an insufficient condition for power sector sustainability&#13;
                                           unless its outputs lead to the procurement of new generation capacity and the related&#13;
                                           investments in the transmission network. A procurement framework that ensures the&#13;
                                           transparent and competitive delivery of new plants and which is linked to planning&#13;
                                           outcomes should therefore be established. Due to the existing structure of the power&#13;
                                           sector in Zambia, such a procurement framework should also have a mechanism for&#13;
                                           allocating new build opportunities between state-owned ZESCO and the private sector&#13;
                                           through Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The current procurement method by&#13;
                                           which developers enter into lengthy post-award negotiations with ZESCO and govern-&#13;
                                           ment should be reviewed in order to reduce implementation delays. This could include&#13;
                                           the development of template agreements (power purchase agreement, implementa-&#13;
                                           tion agreement etc.) and the establishment of indicative security arrangements.&#13;
&#13;

                                           revealed the importance of ensuring that the power sector has sufficient funds for&#13;
It is crucial that                         electricity service provision. Inadequate electricity tariffs limit the extent to which the&#13;

tariff framework&#13;
                                           capacity and network expansion by either ZESCO or private parties can be made. Elec-&#13;

                                           tricity tariffs that are lower than the cost of service only benefit those with existing elec-&#13;
costs of efficient&#13;

service provision&#13;
is established and                         reliability of supply. Furthermore, low tariffs slow down the rate at which those without&#13;
effectively applied.                       access, which is the majority of the population, can receive connections.&#13;
&#13;
                                           In addressing financial sustainability, it is crucial that an electricity tariff framework that&#13;
                                           reflects the costs of efficient service provision is established and effectively applied.&#13;
                                           ZESCO and other utilities in the sector should be allowed to collect revenues suffi-&#13;
                                           cient to cover efficient costs, through tariffs charged to all consumers able to pay them.&#13;
                                           These revenues should also be sufficient to fund a subsidy program (social safety net)&#13;
                                           aimed at those consumers whose ability to pay is lower than the level that reflects the&#13;
                                           full cost of supply. In the event that this is not possible wholly or in part, an affordable&#13;
                                           subsidy program should be provided through direct and transparent transfers from the&#13;
                                           government treasury.&#13;
&#13;
                                           iii. Increasing access to electricity: Given Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s low electrification rate (32%&#13;
                                           overall), it would also be important to complement the LCPDP with a strategy, complete&#13;
                                           with action plans to scale-up access to electricity. This should comprise the priorities&#13;
                                           for electrification, a definition of funding sources (e.g. grants, loans, national budget&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                         6 th Z A M B I A E C O N O M I C B R I E F - P O W E R I N G T H E Z A M B I A N E C O N O M Y&#13;

To complement                allocations, tariff levies etc.), technical options and implementation arrangements for&#13;

management                   candescent light bulbs, and was able to shed-off approximately 57MW of peak demand.&#13;
measures should&#13;
                             The possibility of a further large-scale distribution of CFLs should be considered. This&#13;
also be considered.&#13;
                             would require an assessment of how widespread the use of incandescent bulbs is. It is&#13;
                             also important to recognize that at low tariffs, there is limited incentive to use electricity&#13;
                             more efficiently.&#13;
&#13;

 Box     Diversification and demand-side measures in Ethiopia&#13;
 	4      Ethiopia suffered a similar power crisis to Zambia in 2009-10, prior to which diversification of electric-&#13;
 ity generation, away from hydro to some degree, was not among its priorities. However, after experiencing&#13;
 severe load shedding, Ethiopia started to diversify its generation portfolio by investing heavily in geothermal&#13;
 and wind energy to complement its hydro resources.&#13;
&#13;
 Ethiopia has also aggressively pursued demand side management activities to mitigate the impact of its&#13;
 power crisis and improve the countryâ&#128;&#153;s energy efficiency. Central to these efforts was an energy-efficiency&#13;
 program that distributed 350,000 compact fluorescent lamp bulbs free of charge, following lessons from&#13;
 similar interventions in the Philippines, Rwanda, Thailand, Uganda and Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
 A recent World Bank evaluation estimates the impact of the program to be about 45-50 kilowatt hours per&#13;
 customer per month, or about 13.3 megawatts of energy savings in total. The study finds that the majority of&#13;
 beneficiaries were low-volume customersâ&#128;&#148; mostly from among the poorâ&#128;&#148;although the program was not&#13;
 specifically targeted. It also suggests that energy savings were larger for the poor. On the downside how-&#13;
 ever, about 20% of the initial energy savings disappeared within 18 months of the programâ&#128;&#153;s completion,&#13;
 suggesting sustained efforts are needed to counter such rebound effects.&#13;

          A simple way of understanding the relationship between capacity and energy is equating this to a truck. In&#13;
          order for a truck to carry a certain load, its engine should at least be of a certain size (capacity). But to do so&#13;
          over a distance, say 100km, requires that the truck has sufficient diesel (energy).&#13;

            Powering the Zambian economy
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Zambia faces its toughest economic
            challenges in at least a decade. The economy has come under
            strain in 2015 as external headwinds and domestic pressures
            have intensified. The main domestic risks are threefold.
            Firstly, that the power crisis will worsen. Secondly, a
            deterioration of confidence in the economy, leading to
            further weakening of the currency and increased levels of
            inflation. Lastly, a bad harvest that serves to increase
            food prices and reduce rural and agricultural incomes, with
            the greatest impact falling on the poorest households.
            Commodity-exporting countries’ policy makers face increasing
            challenges across the globe. Zambia is no exception and must
            grapple with multiple challenges as the economy slows down.
            Strengthening the fiscal position and restoring fiscal
            buffers are necessary to increase confidence in the economy,
            reduce the need for costly borrowing, and build resilience
            against further exogenous shocks. Economic progress since
            2000, driven by mining production and services, has
            substantially increased the demand for electricity in
            Zambia. Key to note is that an increase in tariffs to
            cost-reflective levels is necessary but not sufficient to
            increase private investment in electricity generation in
            Zambia. The new generation capacity and emergency measures
            for 2016 will help in mitigating the impact of the power
            crisis in the coming year, but global experience shows there
            is no substitute for effective planning. Particular efforts
            are needed to improve sector planning and the procurement
            processes for large power projects.
