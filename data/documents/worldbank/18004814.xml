&amp;#12;                          Ibrahim Shihata&#13;
                            May 11, 1994&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I'm William Becker with George Washington University and&#13;
&#13;
the Business History Group.&#13;
Q:     I'm Jochen Kraske, the Bank's historian.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I am David Milobsky, the assistant to the historian.&#13;
&#13;
A:     I'm Ibrahim Shihata, General Counsel at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Mr. Shihata, it's a pleasure to meet you and we're&#13;
&#13;
pleased to have the opportunity to talk to you today.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I wonder if we could begin by asking you to talk a&#13;
&#13;
little bit about your educational background.&#13;
&#13;
A:     I received my first law degree from Cairo University in&#13;
&#13;
1957; then a diploma in Public Law from Cairo University in&#13;
&#13;
'58; a diploma in Private Law from Cairo University in '59;&#13;
&#13;
then a Master's in Law from Harvard Law School in '62; and an&#13;
&#13;
SJD, Doctorate of Juridical Science, Harvard Law School,      1&#13;
                                                                  64.&#13;
&#13;
I also have a seminar diploma from the Hague Academy of&#13;
&#13;
International Law.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     What influenced your decision to pursue a career in the&#13;
&#13;
law?&#13;
&#13;
A:     It has been in my mind since I was a child.   I've always&#13;
&#13;
wanted to be in the international legal area.     At the age of&#13;
&#13;
10, I wrote in a school essay that I wanted to be an&#13;
&#13;
international judge so that I could make peace in the world.&#13;
&amp;#12;. tj'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         Shihata, Page 2&#13;
        I remember that essay because the teacher laughed so loud&#13;
&#13;
        when he read it.     Now, of course, part of my job here is&#13;
        heading the International Center for Settlement of Investment&#13;
&#13;
        Disputes (ICSID), which allows me to appoint international&#13;
        judges every now and then.&#13;
&#13;
        Q:   We'd like to ask you about some of your experiences&#13;
&#13;
        before coming to the Bank.    You had a distinguished career&#13;
&#13;
        before arriving here.    One of your first experiences was your&#13;
&#13;
        work with the Council of State of the Egyptian Government&#13;
&#13;
        from 1957 to 1960.    What were your responsibilities there?&#13;
&#13;
        A:   The State Council or the conseil d'Etat is a system&#13;
&#13;
        borrowed from France.    It advises the Government on legal&#13;
&#13;
        matters and, runs a set of administrative courts which&#13;
&#13;
        resolve disputes between the government and public entities&#13;
&#13;
        on the one hand, and their personnel and third parties such&#13;
&#13;
        as contractors, suppliers, etc., on the other hand.    I worked&#13;
&#13;
        in the Legal Advisor's Office, which was divided by Ministry.&#13;
&#13;
        Each Ministry had a section in the Conseil d'Etat which&#13;
&#13;
        provided it with legal advice.    At that time, the Council&#13;
&#13;
        appointed the first five or six top law graduates of the&#13;
&#13;
        university.   I happened to be the top graduate in '57, so I&#13;
&#13;
        was appointed, even though my intention at the time was to&#13;
&#13;
        pursue post-graduate studies and a career in academia.&#13;
&#13;
        However, since I was appointed in the first month after&#13;
&amp;#12;. 'I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           Shihata, Page 3&#13;
&#13;
       graduation, I thought that I'd work at the Council until I&#13;
&#13;
       got a university position.        As luck would have it, I ended up&#13;
&#13;
       enjoying my work at the Council immensely.        The university,&#13;
&#13;
       in comparison, appeared less interesting, and since I could&#13;
&#13;
       work and pursue my post-graduate studies at the same time, I&#13;
&#13;
       decided to remain at the Council.        During my first year at&#13;
&#13;
       the Council, I worked in the Legal Advisor's Office for two&#13;
&#13;
       Ministries.        Following this, I was chosen to work in the&#13;
&#13;
       Office of the President of the Conseil d'Etat, the so-called&#13;
&#13;
       Technical Bureau.        After one year there, I was chosen to work&#13;
&#13;
       in the Technical Bureau of the President of the Republic.&#13;
&#13;
               At that time, 1959 (Egypt and Syria became one country&#13;
&#13;
       in '58), the President had offices in Cairo and Damascus, and&#13;
&#13;
       I was the most junior member of the office in Damascus.&#13;
&#13;
       While in Damascus, I applied to Harvard Law School.        I went&#13;
&#13;
       directly from Damascus to Cambridge, Mass. in September,&#13;
&#13;
       1960.&#13;
&#13;
               After my training at Harvard, I returned immediately to&#13;
&#13;
       Cairo.     Interestingly, just as I finished my doctorate at&#13;
&#13;
       Harvard in    1   64, I received a letter from the then General&#13;
&#13;
       Counsel of the Bank, Mr. Broches.       Mr. Broches, at that time,&#13;
&#13;
       was working on the establishment of the International Center&#13;
&#13;
       for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.&#13;
&#13;
               One of my professors gave him my name, and he wrote me a&#13;
&amp;#12;II   ,   It""&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  Shihata, Page 4&#13;
&#13;
                letter asking if I would be interested in joining the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
                work for ICSID.     I declined because I had previously made a&#13;
&#13;
                commitment to teach at Ain-Shams University in cairo.       At&#13;
                that time, I was planning to make a career in academia.&#13;
&#13;
                However, it didn't work out that way because, after two years&#13;
&#13;
                of teaching, a friend of mine at Harvard who was a student&#13;
&#13;
                working on his Master's in Political Science, Abdul-Latif Al-&#13;
&#13;
                Hamed, was appointed in 1962 Deputy Head of the Kuwait Fund&#13;
&#13;
                for Economic Development and became its Director-General in&#13;
&#13;
                1963.&#13;
&#13;
                        The Kuwait Fund was meant to be Kuwait's aid agency to&#13;
&#13;
                other Arab countries.     At that time, it was small and&#13;
&#13;
                provided development finance only to Arab countries.       In&#13;
&#13;
                1965, Al-Hamed contacted me and asked me to join his staff&#13;
&#13;
                after we met again in a conference of Arab economists.          I was&#13;
&#13;
                interested in international development issues (earlier that&#13;
&#13;
                year, I had written a paper on the legal aspects of Arab&#13;
&#13;
                economic cooperation), so I agreed to a one-year appointment&#13;
&#13;
                with the Kuwait Fund.     That's how I ended up in Kuwait in&#13;
&#13;
                September '66.&#13;
&#13;
                Q:      What were your responsibilities there?&#13;
&#13;
                A:      I was the Legal Advisor.   They had two Legal Advisors.&#13;
&#13;
                Before I arrived, they had one Legal Advisor who had come&#13;
&#13;
                from the World Bank, an Egyptian, El-Fishawi.      He spent four&#13;
&amp;#12;...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       Shihata, Page 5&#13;
      years at the Kuwait Fund and had to return to the Bank, so&#13;
&#13;
      they appointed me and a lawyer from Sudan to replace him.        I&#13;
      had originally planned to spend only one year in Kuwait.&#13;
&#13;
      However, I stayed for four years because it was more&#13;
&#13;
      interesting than I thought earlier.     After four years, I&#13;
&#13;
      returned to the university in Egypt.&#13;
&#13;
      Q:      What were some of the legal issues that you had to deal&#13;
&#13;
      with?&#13;
&#13;
      A:      All the responsibilities of a legal counsel of a&#13;
&#13;
      development finance organization from personnel matters to&#13;
&#13;
      international law issues.     In some ways, I had more&#13;
&#13;
      responsibility in Kuwait than here in the World Bank because&#13;
&#13;
      the institution was quite small, and the role of the lawyer&#13;
&#13;
      was much greater.     For instance, no mission would leave the&#13;
&#13;
      Fund without the Legal Advisor, and, quite often, the Legal&#13;
&#13;
      Advisor would be the spokesman for the mission.    He would be&#13;
&#13;
      the one who led negotiations.    That, of course, helped me a&#13;
&#13;
      great deal in developing my own negotiating abilities.&#13;
&#13;
           I was also responsible for two important initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
      One was the establishment of a regional fund, the Arab Fund&#13;
&#13;
      for Economic and Social Development.    Following the defeat of&#13;
&#13;
      the Arab countries in the '67 war, there was a meeting of the&#13;
&#13;
      heads of Arab countries in Khartoum, Sudan, and they decided,&#13;
&#13;
      on the suggestion of Kuwait, to establish a regional Arab&#13;
&amp;#12;,.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      Shihata, Page 6&#13;
      fund to promote economic development.   Many had cited the&#13;
     lack of development as one of the main reasons for defeat;&#13;
&#13;
     the Arab Fund was intended to help address this shortcoming.&#13;
&#13;
     The agreement establishing the Arab Fund was, I would say, my&#13;
     first work on a regional convention.&#13;
&#13;
          The other initiative for which I was responsible, was&#13;
&#13;
     the establishment of an Arab agency to insure investment&#13;
&#13;
     against non-commercial risks.   Such an agency seemed to be&#13;
&#13;
     necessary in the late '60s because the division between rich&#13;
&#13;
     and poor Arab countries was growing wider and wider.    Some&#13;
&#13;
     oil- exporters became much richer, while other countries&#13;
&#13;
     remained poor.   It made a lot of sense for the oil-producers&#13;
&#13;
     to invest in the neighboring territories, but there were&#13;
&#13;
     always fears of non-commercial risks, especially since, at&#13;
&#13;
     that time, nationalization, socialism, etc. were very much in&#13;
&#13;
     vogue.   The Kuwait Fund convened a meeting in Kuwait in 1966,&#13;
&#13;
     which was attended by Ministers of Industry and other&#13;
&#13;
     officials.   They agreed in principle to the Fund's proposal&#13;
&#13;
     to devise a code for inter-Arab investment, and establish a&#13;
&#13;
     center (like ICSID) for the settlement of inter-Arab&#13;
&#13;
     investment disputes, and a corporation to issue guarantees&#13;
&#13;
     against non-commercial risks.   Of course, we benefitted from&#13;
&#13;
     the work of the World Bank during this period.    The Bank had&#13;
&#13;
     just established ICSID and was working on establishing an&#13;
&amp;#12;''&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        Shihata, Page 7&#13;
&#13;
     agency for the guarantee of foreign investments against non-&#13;
&#13;
     commercial risks.&#13;
&#13;
            Historically, this is interesting because that agency&#13;
&#13;
     (MIGA) became a reality after I joined the Bank.       However,&#13;
&#13;
     while in Kuwait, I worked on a smaller enterprise for the&#13;
&#13;
     same purpose, a regional agency for the Arab countries.         The&#13;
&#13;
     agreement establishing this Arab agency was signed in 1971&#13;
&#13;
     and it became operational in 1974.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     So you stayed in Kuwait through 1976?&#13;
&#13;
     A:     No.   I left in 1970.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     Oh, I see.   And then--&#13;
&#13;
     A:     I went back to teaching.     I became an associate&#13;
&#13;
     professor.    Benefitting from my experiences, I taught&#13;
&#13;
     International Economic Law.       I taught a new course on that&#13;
&#13;
     subject for graduate students.      After two years of doing&#13;
&#13;
     that, I was asked to go to Kuwait to review the preparatory&#13;
&#13;
     work on launching the Arab Fund.      At that time, Al-Hamed&#13;
&#13;
     tried to persuade me to return and I returned to Kuwait in&#13;
&#13;
     '72.    I stayed there for four years.    This was during the&#13;
&#13;
     ''oil crisis'' period.&#13;
&#13;
            Suddenly, Kuwait became more important, both regionally&#13;
&#13;
     and internationally.     It became very active in the IDA&#13;
&#13;
     negotiations, in World Bank activities, and in the&#13;
&#13;
     establishment of the Development Committee in '74.      I was a&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       Shihata, Page 8&#13;
      constant member of the Kuwaiti delegation to the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
     annual meetings, so I would participate in activities of that&#13;
&#13;
     type.     I was also active in the establishment of all sorts of&#13;
&#13;
     institutions in the region, like the Arab Bank for Economic&#13;
&#13;
     Development in Africa--I remember writing the first draft&#13;
&#13;
     agreement establishing that; and the Arab Organization for&#13;
&#13;
     Agricultural Development in Khartoum.      I represented Kuwait&#13;
&#13;
     in the negotiations leading to the establishment of the&#13;
&#13;
     International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), where&#13;
&#13;
     I ended up being the chairman of the committee which wrote&#13;
&#13;
     the charter for that Fund.      Furthermore, I also represented&#13;
&#13;
     Kuwait in the negotiations for establishing the OPEC Fund,&#13;
&#13;
     where I was appointed as the first head of that organization&#13;
&#13;
     in 1976.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   Were you involved at all in the suez Canal negotiations?&#13;
&#13;
     A:      No.   I was only indirectly involved, because the Suez&#13;
&#13;
     Canal reopening was co-financed by the World Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
     Kuwait Fund.     The negotiations were completed by the time I&#13;
&#13;
     arrived, but, I was there when the loan agreement took effect&#13;
&#13;
     and during the implementation.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   This was after the '67 war?&#13;
&#13;
     A:   Right.     I visited the Suez Canal Authority a number of&#13;
&#13;
     times on that count, but I was not directly involved.     I did&#13;
&#13;
     become involved with the co-financing with the Bank of a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Shihata, Page 9&#13;
number of projects, like the Ar Rahad project in Sudan, a big&#13;
&#13;
irrigation project.     A more interesting one is the potassium&#13;
&#13;
project in Jordan, where we were here trying to finalize&#13;
&#13;
everything.     Both the IBRD and IFC were involved.     W. R.&#13;
&#13;
Grace, an American company, was to be the manager and the&#13;
&#13;
marketer of the project.       We were sitting in the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
offices on June 3, 1967, when a gentleman from     w.   R. Grace&#13;
&#13;
said, "Sorry, we can't go on.      There will be war in a few&#13;
&#13;
days."     We told him, No, this is just propaganda and unless&#13;
&#13;
Israel initiates an attack, there cannot be war.        He said,&#13;
&#13;
"No.     There will be war."   He left, and the whole thing&#13;
&#13;
collapsed.     In fact, I left Washington on June 4, and while I&#13;
&#13;
was in the air, Israel attacked and the war started.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     When you returned to the Kuwait Fund, you mentioned that&#13;
&#13;
you arrived along with the influx of oil dollars.        I was just&#13;
&#13;
curious if you noticed any changes in the organization after&#13;
&#13;
your return.     Did the structure change?   Did the outlook&#13;
&#13;
change?&#13;
&#13;
A:     The Kuwait Fund changed financially and geographically.&#13;
&#13;
Until 1974, it was an agency for financing development in&#13;
&#13;
Arab countries.     In '74, a new law was issued increasing its&#13;
&#13;
capital from 200 million Kuwaiti dinars--the Kuwaiti dinar at&#13;
&#13;
that time was 2.8 dollars--to one billion Kuwaiti dinars, and&#13;
&#13;
increasing its scope from Arab countries to all developing&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Shihata, Page 10&#13;
countries.    since that time, its capital has doubled, and the&#13;
&#13;
geographic scope includes also southern European and the new&#13;
&#13;
east European countries.&#13;
&#13;
      Meanwhile, the Saudi Fund was established in      1   74; the&#13;
&#13;
Iraqi Fund was established in    1&#13;
                                     74; and the Arab Fund's&#13;
&#13;
capital was increased.     The Kuwait Fund was involved, either&#13;
&#13;
as an advisor or otherwise, in all these activities.           In&#13;
&#13;
addition, as I mentioned, all sorts of regional and&#13;
&#13;
international initiatives were taken where funding from OPEC&#13;
&#13;
sources was needed.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Who was involved in getting you to move from the Kuwait&#13;
&#13;
Fund to the OPEC Fund?&#13;
&#13;
A:    As I said, I was representing Kuwait in the&#13;
&#13;
negotiations.     Arab countries having their own assistance&#13;
&#13;
funds were not very enthusiastic about the establishment of&#13;
&#13;
the OPEC Fund.     Iran and Venezuela, important members of OPEC&#13;
&#13;
which did not have national Funds for foreign assistance,&#13;
&#13;
were pushing hard for a common fund.       Iran came with a&#13;
&#13;
proposal, Venezuela with a detailed written proposal, and&#13;
&#13;
Saudi Arabia, finding that the trend was too strong, said,&#13;
&#13;
''Fine.   Let's have a one-year facility, to be administered by&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank."    The Saudis always had great confidence in&#13;
&#13;
the world Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      Kuwait really had no particular position except that, it&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     Shihata, Page 11&#13;
&#13;
     wanted to be sure that the OPEC initiative would be&#13;
&#13;
     technically sound so that it wouldn't fall apart.     In order&#13;
&#13;
     to balance all these different positions, I came up with a&#13;
     proposal to establish a facility to be funded by each country&#13;
&#13;
     through an agency designated by that country.     Each agency,&#13;
&#13;
     would keep the contribution of the country within its own&#13;
&#13;
     accounts, and the OPEC facility would just be the&#13;
&#13;
     coordinator.     It was a simple arrangement which gave a&#13;
&#13;
     prominent role for each country, and therefore was easier to&#13;
&#13;
     accept by the Arab members.&#13;
&#13;
             Since I took a leading role in the negotiations, Iran,&#13;
&#13;
     oddly enough, suggested my name as the first head of the&#13;
&#13;
     facility, and the others agreed.&#13;
&#13;
             I headed the agency during a critical period in OPEC's&#13;
&#13;
     history.     There was mounting pressure from developed and&#13;
&#13;
     developing countries on OPEC countries to give more money to&#13;
&#13;
     other developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
            As I said, the Arab countries were doing that through&#13;
&#13;
     their own initiatives, their own national Funds, etc., and in&#13;
     1&#13;
         74 they opened these Funds for all developing countries, not&#13;
&#13;
     just the Arab ones, so they did not feel they had to do&#13;
&#13;
     anything more.    Venezuela was concerned about pressure from&#13;
&#13;
     its neighbors in Latin America, while Iran wanted to play a&#13;
&#13;
     more prominent international role.    These factors led them to&#13;
&amp;#12;. 'Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       Shihata, Page 12&#13;
&#13;
       propose the formation of the OPEC Fund.    There was an attempt&#13;
&#13;
       to do something within the World Bank, that didn't work, so&#13;
       they suggested that OPEC take the initiative.&#13;
&#13;
            The OPEC Fund also played the other useful role of&#13;
&#13;
       coordinating the position of these countries.    For instance,&#13;
&#13;
       in IFAD, for the first time, an international financial&#13;
&#13;
       institution was created where two-thirds of the votes were in&#13;
&#13;
       the hands of developing countries, and half of that, that's&#13;
&#13;
       one-third of the votes, in the hands of OPEC countries.     You&#13;
       couldn't have gotten that without a very good negotiating&#13;
&#13;
       team and power.   The main source of this power was the fact&#13;
&#13;
       that, OPEC countries were able to contribute more than 40% of&#13;
&#13;
       the resources through the OPEC Fund.    The Western countries&#13;
&#13;
       were not keen to establish IFAD.    A conference was held in&#13;
&#13;
       Rome, the World Food Conference, which resolved that there&#13;
&#13;
       should be a Fund for Agricultural Development to be financed&#13;
&#13;
       by OECD and OPEC countries.&#13;
&#13;
            While I was in Vienna, I remained as Kuwait's&#13;
&#13;
       representative on the board of IFAD.   OPEC countries had six&#13;
&#13;
       seats there (and six alternates).   Since I was heading the&#13;
&#13;
       OPEC Fund, I was asked to coordinate the position of OPEC&#13;
&#13;
       countries within IFAD.   I hate to 'say this, but, I was&#13;
&#13;
       sitting there virtually with one-third of the votes, which&#13;
&#13;
       was a very prominent position.&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                               Shihata, Page 13&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   This seems to be moving you toward operational issues&#13;
&#13;
     and away from legal issues.&#13;
&#13;
     A:   Even in the Kuwait Fund, I was not limited to legal&#13;
&#13;
     affairs.    Becau_se of my close relationship with Al-Hamed and&#13;
&#13;
     the small number of the people in the Kuwait Fund, I was&#13;
&#13;
     exposed to all sorts of issues.       I represented Kuwait at many&#13;
&#13;
     meetings.     I twice accompanied Kuwait's foreign minister to&#13;
&#13;
     the meeting of Non-Aligned Countries.          The foreign minister&#13;
&#13;
     asked me to sit for him in the meetings on several occasions.&#13;
&#13;
          The OPEC Fund experience was a wide-ranging one.&#13;
&#13;
     However, I have never forgotten that I am a lawyer.               While in&#13;
&#13;
     the OPEC Fund, I was deeply involved in legal work.               I&#13;
&#13;
     appointed an assistant, but I did a great deal of the&#13;
&#13;
     technical legal work myself, mainly out of concern for my own&#13;
&#13;
     profession.    I don't consider management a profession.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   How, then, did you come to the World Bank in 1983?&#13;
&#13;
     A:   It started in   1&#13;
                              78, when I received a call from someone&#13;
&#13;
     in the Bank who said that Mr. McNamara wanted me to come to&#13;
     the Bank as Deputy General Counsel.          At that time, I had an&#13;
&#13;
     encounter with McNamara (perhaps in      1   77 or   1   78) where someone&#13;
&#13;
     told him that I was a great critic of the world Bank.                 He&#13;
&#13;
     started shouting at me and I admitted to criticizing the Bank&#13;
&#13;
     and offered to tell him why.      And at the end of that meeting,&#13;
&#13;
     I agreed to send him a letter detailing my proposals for&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           Shihata, Page 14&#13;
     improving the World Bank's legal work.           I later received a&#13;
&#13;
     detailed reply from Mr. Broches.           It was the typical defense&#13;
&#13;
     of what was going on.&#13;
&#13;
          In       1&#13;
                       78, someone else from the World Bank called.    It was&#13;
&#13;
     a strange call, because it wasn't McNamara.           It was someone&#13;
     saying that McNamara was thinking of asking me to serve as&#13;
&#13;
     Deputy General Counsel for a few months before becoming the&#13;
&#13;
     General Counsel.          I told her that if McNamara was interested,&#13;
&#13;
     then he should call me.          I was not really interested and&#13;
&#13;
     McNamara never called, so nothing happened.&#13;
&#13;
          Four years later, I met Mr. Clausen, through the&#13;
&#13;
     Tidewater meetings and he asked me to join the Bank.             This&#13;
&#13;
     was in    1&#13;
                   82.    I had just been reelected to another five-year&#13;
&#13;
     term in the OPEC Fund, so I declined Clausen's offer.&#13;
&#13;
     Clausen then talked, independently, to the Finance Ministers&#13;
&#13;
     of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.          Al-Hamed was then the Minister&#13;
&#13;
     of Finance in Kuwait, and he mentioned to me that there has&#13;
&#13;
     always been some concern about the fact that the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
     did not have an Arab citizen in its management corps.&#13;
&#13;
          Apparently, Clausen felt that if there had to be an Arab&#13;
&#13;
     in upper management, then I should be the one.          He talked to&#13;
&#13;
     the Ministers, and they felt that I should take the job.&#13;
&#13;
     After all, they had been asking for an opportunity like this&#13;
&#13;
     one for quite some time.          They talked to me about it, but I&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Shihata, Page 15&#13;
&#13;
     was reluctant to leave the OPEC Fund.    The Fund was very&#13;
&#13;
     successful, and I was clearly in charge.    The board would&#13;
&#13;
     meet three times a year, each time for one day.    All the real&#13;
&#13;
     power lay .in the hands of the DirectorÂ·General.   In short, I&#13;
&#13;
     was quite satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
          I wasn't very interested in a job at the Bank, but I&#13;
&#13;
     couldn't ignore the wishes of those people who had elected me&#13;
&#13;
     in the OPEC Fund.   I agreed to accept Clausen's offer, but I&#13;
&#13;
     wouldn't leave until they had found a successor.    Clausen&#13;
&#13;
     didn't have a problem with this, even after I told him that&#13;
&#13;
     the selection process could take up to one year.   That really&#13;
&#13;
     made it impossible for me to say no.    To keep a position open&#13;
&#13;
     for a year in order to get a person was just too flattering.&#13;
&#13;
     Clausen appointed Mr. Scott as Acting General Counsel, from&#13;
&#13;
     September'82 until I came on August 1, 1983.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   We want to ask about the issues that you had to deal&#13;
&#13;
     with when you first came here, but, briefly, could you tell&#13;
&#13;
     us about the criticisms you had made to McNamara in that&#13;
&#13;
     letter about the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
     A:   It is a typical criticism of the Bank which a lot of&#13;
&#13;
     people are still making today.   I told him that the Bank was&#13;
&#13;
     drowning in paperwork.   The loan agreements at that time were&#13;
&#13;
     thick documents that no one in the developing countries could&#13;
&#13;
     reasonably be expected to understand.   I questioned this.    I&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      Shihata, Page 16&#13;
     suggested that the Bank have a framework agreement and then&#13;
&#13;
     have a two- to five-page agreement dealing with each specific&#13;
&#13;
     project.   The goal was to end up with broad general&#13;
&#13;
     conditions and slim loan agreements.      I felt that a situation&#13;
&#13;
     like that would make it easier for the countries' parliaments&#13;
&#13;
     to approve the agreements.     There wasn't any need for the&#13;
&#13;
     Bank to do things that the government should do for&#13;
&#13;
     themselves.    The OPEC and Kuwait funds, on the other hand,&#13;
&#13;
     handled these matters quite differently.&#13;
          In the Kuwait Fund, a mission would go to appraise the&#13;
&#13;
     project on the ground.     We would stay two to three weeks,&#13;
&#13;
     appraise the project, negotiate it, and sign the initial&#13;
&#13;
     understanding.     After our return, we would then spend another&#13;
&#13;
     three or four weeks writing the fancy report to the Board and&#13;
&#13;
     preparing the loan agreement.     After the Board approved the&#13;
&#13;
     loan, someone from the borrowing country was invited to&#13;
&#13;
     finalize it.     It was very simple.   We didn't go through all&#13;
&#13;
     the hassle that went on in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
          Of course, the Bank can always argue that it is more&#13;
&#13;
     sophisticated, more technical, etc.     Experience, however,&#13;
&#13;
     shows that the difference is not worth it because sometimes&#13;
&#13;
     you spend four years working on a project, and then in real&#13;
&#13;
     life it is very different.     In short, I felt I had made a&#13;
&#13;
     good argument for simplifying loan procedures, acting more&#13;
&amp;#12;-~   ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             Shihata, Page 17&#13;
&#13;
          quickly, and doing more work in the field.&#13;
&#13;
          Q:   If you compared the Bank with the Kuwait Fund, or the&#13;
&#13;
          OPEC Fund today, how would you describe their differences?&#13;
&#13;
          A:   It was entirely a matter of attitude.        The Bank is a&#13;
&#13;
          very difficult place to change.    It's a heavy, heavy machine,&#13;
&#13;
          so adjusting it is not easy, especially for someone coming&#13;
&#13;
          from the outside.    That's why every President comes with a&#13;
&#13;
          lot of ideas and leaves with the ideas.        However, it is&#13;
&#13;
          changing, slowly but surely.    In the coming period, I believe&#13;
&#13;
          that you will see more changes.    Preston is different.        He is&#13;
&#13;
          more determined:    He put a large number of younger people&#13;
&#13;
          with no allegiance to inherited ideas in top positions, so&#13;
&#13;
          you are likely to find more change now.        Whether it will be&#13;
&#13;
          for the better is yet to be seen, but change is surely&#13;
&#13;
          coming.&#13;
&#13;
          Q:   When you arrived in August of    1   83, what did you see as&#13;
&#13;
          the key challenges of this new position?&#13;
&#13;
          A:   First, I discovered that the Legal Department was very&#13;
&#13;
          demoralized.   It was marginalized.       My predecessor was&#13;
&#13;
          practically asked to resign.   Then, there was an Acting&#13;
&#13;
          General Counsel for a year, whom nobody saw as a real equal&#13;
&#13;
          since he was not a Vice President.        Even spatially, the&#13;
&#13;
          Department was pushed outside to a separate building.          Morale&#13;
&#13;
          within the Department was extremely low.       When I first&#13;
&amp;#12;/0   ,"\&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           Shihata, Page 18&#13;
&#13;
           arrived, I asked Mr. Paijmans, the Vice President for&#13;
&#13;
           Personnel and Administration, to move the Department back to&#13;
&#13;
           a more central location.&#13;
&#13;
                Clausen, meanwhile, paid a lot of attention to the&#13;
&#13;
           General Counsel's role in the Bank.   In fact, a few months&#13;
&#13;
           after I arrived he offered to change my title to Senior Vice&#13;
&#13;
           President, and asked me to supervise the work of the Vice&#13;
&#13;
           President and Secretary in addition to my work.     I&#13;
&#13;
           respectfully declined his offer.   I did not think it was&#13;
&#13;
           appropriate for the General counsel to have an administrative&#13;
&#13;
           job of this type.&#13;
&#13;
                When Mr. Clausen left and Mr. Conable came, he promoted&#13;
&#13;
           me to the level of Senior Vice President.   Grade 30, that is.&#13;
&#13;
           Furthermore, he suggested, in the reorganization of     1   87, that&#13;
&#13;
           I head the Legal, Secretary and Administration and Personnel&#13;
&#13;
           Departments.   Conable wanted four Senior Vice Presidents, one&#13;
&#13;
           Operations, one Policy, one Finance, and one everything else.&#13;
&#13;
           In effect, he asked me to be that 'everything else.'        Again,&#13;
&#13;
           I told him that it was not right; that the General Counsel&#13;
&#13;
           should act as an independent legal authority.     If he appeared&#13;
&#13;
           to be part of the day-to-day management, his credibility as&#13;
&#13;
           the Legal Advisor to the Board would be greatly diminished.&#13;
&#13;
           Conable accepted that.&#13;
&#13;
                One of my main concerns was to place the Legal&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Shihata, Page 19&#13;
&#13;
Department at the center, where it belonged.     It is the only&#13;
&#13;
Department in the Bank which sees everything that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
does.    The rest were either geographically focused on the&#13;
&#13;
regions, or sectorally focused.     The Legal Department, on the&#13;
&#13;
other hand, deals with everything, whether it is borrowing,&#13;
&#13;
lending, administration, personnel, or other matters.       It can&#13;
&#13;
act as an independent advisor, free from the constraints of&#13;
&#13;
regional or sectoral concerns.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Were there particular issues that you had to deal with&#13;
&#13;
aside from the morale in the Department?&#13;
&#13;
A:      One big issue which remained unresolved since the&#13;
&#13;
abolition of the gold dollar was the issue of the standard of&#13;
&#13;
value of the Bank's capital.     In December 1983, I submitted&#13;
&#13;
to the Board a detailed legal opinion on that issue which led&#13;
&#13;
to the resolution of the problem.     this was the first in a&#13;
&#13;
series of detailed legal opinions which characterized my role&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank and came to be relied upon as the basis for&#13;
&#13;
policy decisions.     Examples include, the legal opinion on the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's lending limit (which preceded the Bank's issuance of&#13;
&#13;
guarantees in 1984), on the authorized purposes of Bank loans&#13;
&#13;
(which preceded the Bank's lending for debt and debt service&#13;
&#13;
reduction), on governance issues (which preceded the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
open involvement in this field), etc.&#13;
&#13;
        Aside from the Legal Work per se, the first other big&#13;
&amp;#12;..   â&#128;¢'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                Shihata, Page 20&#13;
&#13;
          assignment was MIGA.      When I joined in    1&#13;
                                                            83 the Bank was about&#13;
&#13;
          to permanently shelve the idea of establishing an&#13;
&#13;
          international institution for investment guarantees.               They&#13;
&#13;
          tried it in the Sixties, but it didn't work.            In the early&#13;
&#13;
          eighties, Clausen threw up his hands in frustration.               He&#13;
&#13;
          thought of scrapping the proposal entirely, but I suggested&#13;
&#13;
          that they   ~and   it over to me.   I only asked that no one&#13;
&#13;
          interfere with my work on the issue.         Clausen had no problem&#13;
&#13;
          with that since, he was told MIGA was a dead horse anyway.&#13;
&#13;
               I wrote a paper to the Board suggesting that we revive&#13;
&#13;
          the effort, and only one out of 22 members supported my&#13;
&#13;
          proposal.    Two years later, that same Board unanimously&#13;
&#13;
          approved the MIGA Convention.       It was a dramatic turn-around.&#13;
&#13;
          I was determined to get it done.       It was a simple matter of&#13;
&#13;
          listening to people's concerns and tailoring the proposal to&#13;
&#13;
          meet those concerns.&#13;
&#13;
          Q:   What were some of the concerns?&#13;
&#13;
          A:   Many developed countries had their own national&#13;
&#13;
          agencies.    They didn't see the need to create another one.&#13;
&#13;
          They relied on the advice of their national agencies.               The&#13;
&#13;
          bureaucrats giving that advice saw MIGA as a competitor, so&#13;
&#13;
          there was no enthusiasm on.their part.            on the part of&#13;
&#13;
          developing countries, support was even weaker.            They couldn't&#13;
&#13;
          see a beneficial role of MIGA for them.            On the contrary,&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Shihata, Page 21&#13;
&#13;
     they saw it as n instrument to strengthen the foreign&#13;
&#13;
     investors' position against them.&#13;
&#13;
          I, however, presented a new argument in favor of MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
     In the wake of the Debt Crisis, developing countries could no&#13;
&#13;
     longer rely on commercial loans.    The only potential for a&#13;
&#13;
     reasonable increase of private flows was direct investment&#13;
&#13;
     and portfolio investment.   These investments would not come&#13;
&#13;
     under the current conditions without some guarantee.       MIGA&#13;
&#13;
     would help in providing such guarantees, for funds which did&#13;
&#13;
     not increase the developing countries' debt.&#13;
&#13;
          We made it very clear to the developed countries that&#13;
&#13;
     MIGA was intended to complement, not compete with, their&#13;
&#13;
     national agencies.   I pointed out to them the fact that MIGA&#13;
&#13;
     would help to give the capital of their national agencies&#13;
&#13;
     more leverage.   For the same amount of money these agencies&#13;
&#13;
     could cover many more investments, so MIGA represented a&#13;
&#13;
     benefit for them rather than a loss.    A detailed draft&#13;
&#13;
     convention was prepared.    It reflected in-depth technical&#13;
&#13;
     work which attempted to balance the different interests&#13;
&#13;
     involved.   Then we went through regional consultations.      I&#13;
&#13;
     visited some countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia and&#13;
&#13;
     the Middle East, and then I chaired 30 sessions of the&#13;
&#13;
     "Committee of the Whole," an informal meeting of all the&#13;
&#13;
     Board members.   Eventually, we reached a consensus.&#13;
&amp;#12;''&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     Shihata, Page 22&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   Has MIGA lived up to your expectations?&#13;
&#13;
     A:   MIGA's main problem today is that it has committed all&#13;
     of its capital and is about to reach the limit of its&#13;
&#13;
     guarantee capacity authorized by its Board.     It needs an&#13;
     increase badly.    Otherwise, it has worked well.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   What about its impact on ICSID?&#13;
&#13;
     A:   Minimal.     It did create more work for the ICSID staff&#13;
     because, quite often, private sector clients ask MIGA to&#13;
&#13;
     review investment laws of countries, or give advice on how to&#13;
&#13;
     settle investment disputes.    since the real expertise on&#13;
     these matters is the ICSID staff, they refer them to ICSID.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   In your early years as General Counsel, you started&#13;
&#13;
     dealing with the office itself, and then MIGA.      Did you ever&#13;
&#13;
     get to look at the lending instruments?&#13;
&#13;
     A:   Of course.    In 1984, I introduced changes in the&#13;
&#13;
     standard general conditions and loan agreements which were&#13;
&#13;
     approved by the Board.    The purpose was to simplify these&#13;
     documents and to state clearly in very loan agreement the&#13;
&#13;
     borrower's commitment to the objective of the project.        (This&#13;
&#13;
     idea received much attention later on as the Bank became more&#13;
&#13;
     concerned with the "ownership" of projects by its borrowers.)&#13;
&#13;
     In May 1984, the Bank issued its first guarantee and a new&#13;
&#13;
     instrument (the guarantee agreement) was introduced, even&#13;
&#13;
     though the concept has been emphasized in the Bank's Articles&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Shihata, Page 23&#13;
from the beginning.     This led in time to the adoption of the&#13;
ECO program and is now being pursued further under the theme&#13;
of "streamlining guarantees" in Bank operations.     A number of&#13;
innovative loans which do not finance goods and services were&#13;
also devised, like the debt and debt service reduction loans&#13;
and more recently loans which provide contingent financing as&#13;
a back-up to strengthen the borrower's capital market&#13;
generally or the initial funding of a specific project from&#13;
private sources.&#13;
        In fact, I was involved in all policy issues because&#13;
these issues were discussed in the Managing committee of&#13;
which I was a member.     That was during Clausen's term.&#13;
During Conable's administration, we had the President's&#13;
Council.     Everything of importance would pass through the&#13;
Council, even the appointments to Director positions.       All&#13;
policy issues were discussed in the Council before they went&#13;
to the Board.     Both Clausen and Conable used to refer to me&#13;
as "the only one who reads all these lengthy documents."&#13;
They were probably exaggerating, but I used to read a great&#13;
deal.    That gave me a little advantage.&#13;
Q:      On the borrowing side, the McNamara years brought a&#13;
great increase in the instruments available to raise capital&#13;
for the Bank.     Did that present special legal problems that&#13;
you had to deal with?&#13;
&amp;#12;'Â·'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        Shihata, Page 24&#13;
&#13;
      A:      Not problems as much as issues.   Whenever you do&#13;
&#13;
      something new, you have to establish a sound legal framework&#13;
&#13;
      for it.     The real problem for the legal work here is the very&#13;
&#13;
      fact that we do not work within a well-defined legal system.&#13;
&#13;
      In many respects, there is a vacuum which we have to fill,&#13;
&#13;
      so, quite often, we have to make the rules, not just apply&#13;
&#13;
      them.     If you are a u.s. corporation, you work within a well-&#13;
&#13;
      defined legal system.     However, in the international arena,&#13;
&#13;
      if you want to do something that was not done before, you&#13;
&#13;
      have to set the rules.&#13;
&#13;
              The Bank was the first institution to perform currency&#13;
&#13;
      swaps.     We were also the first to establish trust funds for&#13;
&#13;
      developing nations.     In both cases there were no legal&#13;
&#13;
      precedents to guide us, so we had to write our own rules.&#13;
&#13;
      Q:      Are there any constraints or guidelines that help you to&#13;
&#13;
      make these rules.     Do you rely heavily on economic arguments?&#13;
&#13;
      A:      We use all the arguments we can muster.     If you act like&#13;
&#13;
      a strict lawyer you will not get very far.        You have to be&#13;
&#13;
      flexible.     Take the recent agreement between Israel and the&#13;
&#13;
      PLO, for example.     The Bank committed itself to finance&#13;
&#13;
      several projects in the Occupied Territories, but our&#13;
&#13;
      Articles stipulate that Bank funds must be used "exclusively"&#13;
&#13;
      for the benefit of the members.     Also, if a loan by the IBRD&#13;
&#13;
      is made to an entity other than a government, the Bank must&#13;
&amp;#12;..   .Â·Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          Shihata, Page 25&#13;
&#13;
           obtain a guarantee from the member country where the project&#13;
&#13;
           is located.    In other words, the Bank cannot make a loan&#13;
&#13;
           unless the Occupied Territories are part of a member, a&#13;
&#13;
           dependent territory of a member, or an associated territory&#13;
&#13;
           of a member.   However, the Bank can't say that the Occupied&#13;
&#13;
           Territories are part of Israel, nor can it say that they are&#13;
&#13;
           part of Egypt or Jordan.    In order to resolve this dilemma, I&#13;
&#13;
           proposed that we establish a trust fund for the Occupied&#13;
&#13;
           Territories.   We can't make a loan to the Occupied&#13;
&#13;
           Territories, but a contribution to a trust fund is a&#13;
&#13;
           different animal.    IDA administers the trust fund and makes&#13;
&#13;
           disbursements from the fund to the territories.    This&#13;
&#13;
           arrangement is legally sound.   The Bank has been making&#13;
&#13;
           grants in the interest of all its members since the 1960's.&#13;
&#13;
           we have made a number of grants to IDA, to CGIAR, and to&#13;
&#13;
           other facilities which are of common interest.&#13;
&#13;
           Q:   Are you saying that the Articles are flexible, or do you&#13;
&#13;
           see them as a constraint?&#13;
&#13;
           A:   Some people in the Bank see them as a constraint.       I see&#13;
&#13;
           them as a useful constraint.    If you have a free-for-all, you&#13;
&#13;
           end up in chaos.    That's why countries need constitutions and&#13;
&#13;
           institutions need articles of agreement.    The key is to&#13;
&#13;
           interpret the Articles so that they serve the common&#13;
&#13;
           interest, while preserving the integrity of the institution.&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     Shihata, Page 26&#13;
&#13;
     They are an important constraint.&#13;
&#13;
          I'll give you an example.    The Articles have very&#13;
&#13;
     explicit provisions saying that the Bank shall not interfere&#13;
&#13;
     in the political affairs of its members.     According to the&#13;
&#13;
     Articles, the Bank can take only economic considerations into&#13;
&#13;
     account.   That the Bank's decisions should be guided by the&#13;
&#13;
     efficiency of the economy, not by political considerations&#13;
     and influences.   Now, there are people both inside and&#13;
&#13;
     outside the Bank, especially in the u.s., who wish to use the&#13;
&#13;
     Bank as an instrument of foreign policy.     From their&#13;
&#13;
     viewpoint this is understandable, even if it means forgetting&#13;
&#13;
     about the Articles.     If your foreign policy is to punish&#13;
&#13;
     countries which do not respect human rights as you perceive&#13;
&#13;
     them, then the World Bank can be a very useful instrument.           I&#13;
     believe that this position is inconsistent with the Articles.&#13;
&#13;
     I see the Bank as a very good instrument for the promotion of&#13;
&#13;
     economic human rights, social human rights, cultural human&#13;
&#13;
     rights, but not of political human rights.     I didn't invent&#13;
&#13;
     these words, they were written when I was a child.        The U.S.&#13;
&#13;
     wanted the Bank to be an institution that was credible in the&#13;
&#13;
     financial markets, and they reasoned correctly, that it could&#13;
&#13;
     not have that credibility if it became subject to the&#13;
&#13;
     vagaries of politics.     Insulating the Bank from partisan&#13;
&#13;
     politics and from the short-term interests of its members,&#13;
&amp;#12;,Â·â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     Shihata, Page 27&#13;
&#13;
      was a very important pillar on which the institution was&#13;
      founded.    I consider it part of my job to maintain that&#13;
&#13;
      distance for the best interests of the institution.&#13;
&#13;
      Q:   So you have no problem with some of the decisions that&#13;
&#13;
      had been taken before you got here, like the question of&#13;
&#13;
      program lending, or the transfer of Bank profits to IDA?&#13;
&#13;
      A:   No.    Program lending is allowed under the Articles, but&#13;
&#13;
      as an exception.     There is a provision in the Articles which&#13;
&#13;
      says that the main business of the Bank is to make loans and&#13;
      guarantees for specific projects.    However, it does make&#13;
&#13;
      exceptions in special circumstances.     From the very&#13;
      beginning, the u.s. sought an interpretation that allowed the&#13;
&#13;
      Bank to make stabilization loans, and loans for other than&#13;
&#13;
      specific projects.    There is no legal quarrel with that, as&#13;
&#13;
      long as it does not become the main business of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      But that's not to say that the Bank can tell a country to&#13;
      follow a certain political line.    If the Articles have a&#13;
&#13;
      provision saying, "Do not interfere in political affairs,"&#13;
&#13;
      how can I interpret it to mean "do interfere in political&#13;
&#13;
      affairs?"&#13;
&#13;
      Q:   But, still, subtle changes have obviously taken place.&#13;
&#13;
      As you said, there are economic human rights and agency&#13;
&#13;
      considerations.    Quite often, these concerns are political in&#13;
      nature.&#13;
&amp;#12;''&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Shihata, Page 28&#13;
&#13;
     A:   Of course one has to make distinctions.     The best&#13;
     example is the paper I wrote to the Board on governance.        I&#13;
&#13;
     argued there that there are many governance issues which have&#13;
     direct economic effects, and that's what the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
     concentrate on.   In doing so, the Bank will be protecting&#13;
     human rights without getting involved in politics.     If you&#13;
&#13;
     advocate the rule of law (good civil service, accountability,&#13;
&#13;
     transparency in financial transactions), you will be&#13;
     promoting the basis of political human rights.     If you give a&#13;
&#13;
     country money to improve their civil service, to review their&#13;
     legal system, to improve their judiciary, etc., you are in&#13;
&#13;
     fact laying the groundwork for expanded human rights, but&#13;
&#13;
     without exceeding your legal mandate.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   In places where civil service is one of the few options&#13;
&#13;
     for the well-educated part of the population in an&#13;
&#13;
     underdeveloped country, to talk about reform or making the&#13;
&#13;
     civil service more efficient strikes me as being threatening&#13;
&#13;
     to whole classes of people in particular societies.     I guess&#13;
&#13;
     I'm asking, to put this into a question rather than a&#13;
&#13;
     statement, if there is opposition to your position in&#13;
&#13;
     underdeveloped countries.   I saw your very interesting speech&#13;
&#13;
     to a group of Latin Americans on this question of reform.           Is&#13;
&#13;
     there opposition in Latin America to civil service reform?&#13;
     A:   In Latin America much less than in other parts of the&#13;
&amp;#12;,,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Shihata, Page 29&#13;
&#13;
     world.   Most opposition stems from the fact that countries&#13;
&#13;
     and governments don't like intrusion from outside sources on&#13;
&#13;
     internal matters like civil service reform.    surprisingly,&#13;
&#13;
     many countries now are asking the Bank for help on civil&#13;
&#13;
     service reform.    Next month, we will hold a conference for&#13;
&#13;
     Latin America on the issue of judicial reform.      We deal with&#13;
&#13;
     these matters as technical issues relevant to economic&#13;
&#13;
     development.    The head of the Inter-American Development Bank&#13;
&#13;
     was telling me the other day that they have more requests&#13;
&#13;
     than they can meet in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     This question of governance obviously comes up in&#13;
&#13;
     different contexts.    one is the question of efficiency in the&#13;
&#13;
     Bank and its work.    The other issue, of course, is the&#13;
&#13;
     question of participation and to what extent should the Bank&#13;
&#13;
     involve its beneficiaries in the shaping of projects?&#13;
&#13;
     A:     That latter issue is under discussion now.    In my&#13;
&#13;
     governance paper, I said that participation of beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
     in the design and implementation of the project is a useful&#13;
&#13;
     thing and should be pursued.    However, participation as an&#13;
&#13;
     overall proposition is closely related to the democratization&#13;
&#13;
     of a society, and this is a political issue.     That's not our&#13;
&#13;
     job.&#13;
&#13;
            When the paper went to the Board, it was that particular&#13;
&#13;
     issue that was disputed by one or two members.      The paper as&#13;
&amp;#12;f'   â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          Shihata, Page 30&#13;
&#13;
           a whole was accepted by the Board, but I remember the Dutch&#13;
&#13;
           and the Canadian EDs saying that we should be an instrument&#13;
&#13;
           of democratization.   They did not seem to realize that&#13;
&#13;
           becoming an instrument of democratization places the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
           the heart of domestic politics.&#13;
                It's a difficult issue.   Where would you draw the line?&#13;
&#13;
           In fact, when you entered, I was reading a draft policy paper&#13;
&#13;
           on participation, and it's full of wishy-washy statements.&#13;
&#13;
           This troubles me because, unless you are clear, the Bank will&#13;
&#13;
           encounter trouble in this particular area.    There are&#13;
           countries which could see the Bank staff as coming to incite&#13;
&#13;
           the population against the government, and they would treat&#13;
           them like spies.   They would put them in jail, and so forth.&#13;
           Q:   In looking over the list of your publications, we noted&#13;
&#13;
           your continuing interest in the economic development in the&#13;
&#13;
           Middle East.   In the past, the Bank was criticized for not&#13;
&#13;
           providing enough aid to the Middle East.     Do you think that's&#13;
&#13;
           improved in the last twenty years?&#13;
&#13;
           A:   Not in volume.   In fact, the Bank is giving very little&#13;
&#13;
           to the Middle East nowadays.   In North Africa, the&#13;
           developments in Algeria have slowed down Bank lending to that&#13;
&#13;
           country.   Morocco and Tunisia received some funds.    The Bank&#13;
&#13;
           does not give much money to Egypt, partly because the&#13;
&#13;
           Egyptian government doesn't want to borrow IBRD money, and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Shihata, Page 31&#13;
&#13;
also because the government doesn't like the Bank's trend&#13;
&#13;
toward intrusion in its affairs.&#13;
&#13;
        In Syria, we don't lend because of accumulated arrears.&#13;
&#13;
Jordan and Yemen are small countries, and everything is on&#13;
&#13;
hold in Yemen for the moment.&#13;
&#13;
        Iran could be a large borrower, but unfortunately, we&#13;
&#13;
are not acting on new loans, mainly because of political&#13;
&#13;
considerations, which I'm against personally.&#13;
&#13;
        So, volume-wise, we are not doing much.    Happily, the&#13;
&#13;
Occupied Territories offer the opportunity for the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
play a visible role in the region, and it's taking full&#13;
&#13;
advantage.     Nevertheless, the Bank plays a lesser role in the&#13;
&#13;
Middle East than in any other region.     I'm not happy about&#13;
&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Looking at the changes that have taken place in East&#13;
&#13;
Asia, and more recently in Latin America, do you see anything&#13;
&#13;
like their higher growth rates taking place in the Middle&#13;
&#13;
East, or do you think that cultural factors will prevent this&#13;
&#13;
from happening?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Political stability, not culture, is the primary issue.&#13;
&#13;
It is difficult to generalize because, for instance, the Arab&#13;
&#13;
Gulf countries' economies are very different from the rest of&#13;
&#13;
the Arabs'.     Egypt's case, however, is a problematic one.&#13;
&#13;
Everyone was hoping that once they put the macroeconomic side&#13;
&amp;#12;Iâ&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       Shihata, Page 32&#13;
&#13;
     in order, then investment would pick up by itself.       It didn't&#13;
&#13;
     happen.       They reduced their budget deficit from over 20&#13;
&#13;
     percent to three percent in less than two years.       No country&#13;
&#13;
     in the world has done this.       The Central Bank of Egypt is now&#13;
&#13;
     sitting on 16 billion dollars of reserves.       Only a few years&#13;
&#13;
     back they would only have reserves covering three weeks'&#13;
&#13;
     imports.      The macroeconomic situation has changed, but the&#13;
&#13;
     rate of investment has gone down.       Per capita income has gone&#13;
&#13;
     down.     People don't eat Central Bank reserves.    They eat&#13;
&#13;
     food, and food comes from income.       The man in the street&#13;
&#13;
     doesn't feel that he is better off.       Hence, the political&#13;
&#13;
     situation is deteriorating and the less sophisticated&#13;
&#13;
     Egyptians see this decline as a result of too much contact&#13;
&#13;
     with the West, and subjecting Egypt's will to the will of the&#13;
&#13;
     Fund and the Bank.       In other words, the Bank and the Fund&#13;
&#13;
     have become the new colonialists in the eyes of the public.&#13;
&#13;
     They have a very volatile political situation there, and some&#13;
&#13;
     people are exploiting it.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      So it's larger than the religious differences that the&#13;
&#13;
     Western press tends to focus on?&#13;
&#13;
     A:      No.    In a place like Egypt, religion has always been a&#13;
&#13;
     very important factor.       After all, it was invented there.&#13;
&#13;
     That's nothing new.       What is new is the growing popularity of&#13;
&#13;
     religious political movements.       They are gaining because some&#13;
&amp;#12;,.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       Shihata, Page 33&#13;
&#13;
     people are exploiting the economic situation to project a&#13;
&#13;
     religious solution to Egypt's problems.     They say, "You have&#13;
&#13;
     tried socialism under Nasser and you've seen it didn't work.&#13;
&#13;
     You are now trying capitalism under the    u.s.   and the World&#13;
&#13;
     Bank and you see the disaster that is happening.       Why don't&#13;
&#13;
     you try, for Heaven's Sake, God's solution."       This argument&#13;
&#13;
     is very appealing to simple minded people.&#13;
&#13;
          Furthermore, when people accuse government officials of&#13;
&#13;
     corruption, and they say, "We are religious, we cannot be&#13;
&#13;
     corrupt," etc.     They also offer services (medical services,&#13;
&#13;
     social services) for free or at a very low cost.       In this&#13;
&#13;
     way, they gain credibility.     This phenomenon is not limited&#13;
&#13;
     to Egypt, however.     It is gaining ground throughout the&#13;
&#13;
     entire region.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   In Algeria?&#13;
&#13;
     A:   Yes, even in Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   Turning back to some questions about the management of&#13;
&#13;
     the Bank, we wonder if you would evaluate the workings of the&#13;
&#13;
     Board in regard to its relationship with the Bank staff and&#13;
&#13;
     to the President?&#13;
&#13;
     A:   It has always been, and probably will remain, a&#13;
&#13;
     difficult relationship.     Part of this is inevitable, and part&#13;
&#13;
     can be improved.     If you are a Board member, your job, by&#13;
&#13;
     definition, is to pass judgment on what management does.          If&#13;
&amp;#12;~.   '   '&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            Shihata, Page 34&#13;
&#13;
             you always say, "You are great," you will not be considered&#13;
&#13;
             successful.    That's the inevitable part, criticizing&#13;
&#13;
             proposals, because that's the EDs job.    At least that's what&#13;
&#13;
             they often see as their job.    This tendency becomes more&#13;
&#13;
             pronounced when you have a big title, a big office, and you&#13;
&#13;
             are deprived of the day-to-day power to influence what's&#13;
&#13;
             happening.    As a result, the EDs tend to be more aggressive&#13;
&#13;
             in their intervention.&#13;
&#13;
                  That's the inevitable part.    The rest can, of course, be&#13;
&#13;
             improved and a lot depends on the personalities involved.       It&#13;
&#13;
             also depends on the success or failure on the part of&#13;
&#13;
             management to give the Board members the feeling that they&#13;
&#13;
             are part of the decision-making process, because nothing&#13;
&#13;
             alienates them more than feeling that they are marginal.&#13;
&#13;
                  That's how I see the issue.    I have always explained it&#13;
&#13;
             to the Presidents.    I also wrote some legal opinions on the&#13;
&#13;
             respective roles.    In essence, the issue is not how to define&#13;
&#13;
             it legally, but how to see it working in practice.&#13;
&#13;
             Personalities count, procedures count, and just good sense&#13;
&#13;
             counts, because you can always get what you want if you know&#13;
&#13;
             how to present it, and how to give your interlocutor the&#13;
&#13;
             feeling that he's part of it.&#13;
&#13;
             Q:   How do you see the three Presidents that you have worked&#13;
&#13;
             with--Clausen, conable, and Preston--in negotiating this&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Shihata, Page 35&#13;
&#13;
relationship?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Each one had his good times and bad times.     Clausen, for&#13;
&#13;
instance, had a rough time on the budget issue because no&#13;
&#13;
matter what he said, the u.s., the U.K., and Australia voted&#13;
against him.    I think that was the main issue that caused the&#13;
&#13;
u.s. not to renew his appointment.&#13;
&#13;
     They got Conable in order to improve the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
relationship with the U.S. Congress.    He definitely improved&#13;
&#13;
the relationship with the congress, but not all the way.        The&#13;
&#13;
main source of the opposition has always been the u.s.     The&#13;
&#13;
u.s. takes the Bank much more seriously than other countries,&#13;
&#13;
and the American Administration is under a lot of pressure&#13;
from Congress and from NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
     The relationship between the u.s. and the Bank has not&#13;
&#13;
always been friendly.     Furthermore, the dichotomy between&#13;
&#13;
"Part I" and "Part II" countries also causes problems.     The&#13;
&#13;
developing countries which need money desperately, don't want&#13;
&#13;
to displease anyone.     They don't want to displease management&#13;
&#13;
or major shareholders.     EDs from developing countries must&#13;
therefore learn early on how to express their views without&#13;
&#13;
offending anyone.&#13;
&#13;
     EDs from the developed countries don't have to deal with&#13;
&#13;
that constraint but they often operate under strict&#13;
&#13;
instructions.   Quite often faxes come in from Tokyo, London,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Shihata, Page 36&#13;
&#13;
Stockholm, and other places.&#13;
&#13;
     All these behind-the-scenes considerations affect the&#13;
&#13;
relationship between the Board and management.     However, the&#13;
&#13;
quality of the relationship also depends on who is on the&#13;
&#13;
Board.   If you have strong personalities, it's different.     If&#13;
&#13;
you have obnoxious characters, it's different.     When I first&#13;
&#13;
arrived at the Bank, the Board generally was more cohesive.&#13;
&#13;
You had El-Naggar, who was a very strong leader, representing&#13;
&#13;
borrowing countries.   He would get different EDs (Part II and&#13;
&#13;
Part I) together on issues.    Although he did not represent&#13;
&#13;
strong countries, he was quite effective.&#13;
&#13;
     Many of the Part II EDs who followed El-Naggar lacked&#13;
&#13;
his fortitude and tact.     Occasionally, there were very strong&#13;
&#13;
EDs from India, but their main concern was India.     They&#13;
&#13;
didn't pay that much attention to cross-regional issues.&#13;
&#13;
Then Mr. Potter, from Canada, who caused a lot of tension in&#13;
&#13;
the relationship, not because he was bad (on the contrary, he&#13;
&#13;
was quite serious in his work), but he did not accept that&#13;
&#13;
management should have as much power as it did.     That created&#13;
&#13;
tension every now and then.&#13;
&#13;
     I think Mr. Preston had a hard time in the beginning&#13;
&#13;
accepting the role of the Board.     He didn't like dealing with&#13;
&#13;
Board members one-on-one.     This is changing now, and I see a&#13;
&#13;
big difference.   Nevertheless, there was a lot of tension&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Shihata, Page 37&#13;
&#13;
when he first carne.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What qualities does a World Bank President need to be&#13;
&#13;
successful?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The World Bank is a very "presidential" institution.          A&#13;
&#13;
lot of power is in the hands of the President, especially if&#13;
&#13;
he knows how to use his position well.      The Bank's reputation&#13;
&#13;
and future depends on the President's political standing, how&#13;
&#13;
much he listens, how much he takes initiatives, and how much&#13;
&#13;
he is capable of saying "No," when No is the right answer.&#13;
&#13;
     The choice of a President of the Bank is a very&#13;
&#13;
important decision, and it's in the hands of the U.S., for&#13;
&#13;
all practical purposes.   That's why the   u.s.   has to select&#13;
&#13;
their candidate carefully, because, despite everything we&#13;
&#13;
have said, the Bank serves a great purpose for the United&#13;
&#13;
States, in addition to its global purpose, both politically&#13;
&#13;
and financially.&#13;
&#13;
     Let's not forget that the   u.s.   pays very little capital&#13;
&#13;
to the IBRD, yet, huge amounts are spent in the U.S. to&#13;
&#13;
finance goods and services for Bank projects.       To be exact,&#13;
&#13;
the paid-in capital is less than ten billion dollars, while&#13;
&#13;
the total amount of loans so far,   is about 250 billion&#13;
&#13;
dollars.   Now, about 60 percent of the paid-in capital comes&#13;
&#13;
from so-called "Part I" countries, and the U.S. part is&#13;
&#13;
something like 17 percent, $1.7 billion at most.       From the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               Shihata, Page 38&#13;
&#13;
u.s. standpoint, the Bank is definitely a good investment.&#13;
&#13;
They put in a certain amount, and their returns are&#13;
&#13;
comparatively large.   The Bank spends roughly one billion&#13;
&#13;
dollars a year in the D.C. area alone.   Without the Bank, the&#13;
&#13;
D.C. would be a much poorer city.&#13;
&#13;
     In addition to the economic returns, the Bank also&#13;
&#13;
provides the u.s. with political benefits.    Through the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
the u.s. is able to do many things that it cannot do&#13;
&#13;
directly.   In short, the Bank plays a very useful role for&#13;
&#13;
the united States, and the u.s. should really take the&#13;
&#13;
question of choosing the head of that institution very&#13;
&#13;
seriously because, in the end, the powers of the institution&#13;
&#13;
are, to a great extent, in the hands of the President.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the&#13;
&#13;
various Presidents?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, they are all great men in their own way.     Each one&#13;
&#13;
has different characteristics.   I have not worked under&#13;
&#13;
McNamara, but I hear from those who did that he was a bit too&#13;
&#13;
strong, too pushy sometimes, yet he did have a lot of guts&#13;
&#13;
and determination to get things done.    There isn't any doubt&#13;
&#13;
that the Bank grew tremendously under him.&#13;
&#13;
     Clausen was.a very good manager.    He listened to people.&#13;
&#13;
He gave everyone the sense that he was important.     That's a&#13;
&#13;
very good quality to have.   He could get the best from his&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
'.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         Shihata, Page 39&#13;
&#13;
     people by giving each one the sense that he was important.&#13;
&#13;
     If you are judging people just as managers, I would rate him&#13;
&#13;
     to be the best in that respect.       Apparently, he was not very&#13;
&#13;
     successful in his relationship with the      u.s.   Administration.&#13;
&#13;
             Conable was a politician.    He could get things done as a&#13;
&#13;
     politician, but he would also sometimes accept compromises,&#13;
&#13;
     even if they were not the best thing for the Bank.         He got&#13;
&#13;
     the capital increases and IDA replenishments through&#13;
&#13;
     Congress.     Generally, his relationship with the Board was&#13;
&#13;
     very good, because he was good at forging compromises.&#13;
&#13;
             Preston is very different.    He is a "father type."&#13;
&#13;
     Interestingly, both he and Clausen headed large banks for a&#13;
&#13;
     long time, but their management styles were vastly different.&#13;
&#13;
     He was not used to the idea of a multinational board, a board&#13;
&#13;
     that really must set policies.       Now, he's beginning to accept&#13;
&#13;
     that and he's enjoying a better relationship with the Board.&#13;
&#13;
     In addition, Preston is a bit more abrupt in introducing&#13;
&#13;
     changes because he believes that talking too much spoils the&#13;
&#13;
     game.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      How important do you think it is to have at the head of&#13;
&#13;
     the Bank, somebody who really knows something about&#13;
&#13;
     development issues?&#13;
&#13;
     A:      Obviously, it is useful if you know more about the&#13;
&#13;
     business, but it is not necessary.       If you are intelligent&#13;
&amp;#12;' '"&#13;

&#13;
       you can learn the essentials quickly.     Conable was not a&#13;
&#13;
       professional at all.    However, he was very quick to&#13;
&#13;
       understand the issues and react to them.     More importantly,&#13;
&#13;
       the President should believe in the cause of the institution.&#13;
&#13;
       If you get someone whose real purpose is to cut it down, then&#13;
&#13;
       he will be in big trouble.    Secondly, a president has to be&#13;
&#13;
       very intelligent because of the complexity of the issues.&#13;
&#13;
       The Bank makes complex issues more complex by the way we deal&#13;
&#13;
       with them.    Grasping all these issues, understanding what's&#13;
&#13;
       said and written, and reacting quickly to them requires a&#13;
&#13;
       great deal of intelligence, exposure, and knowledge.     The&#13;
&#13;
       president must be strong because he must withstand a great&#13;
&#13;
       deal of pressure from all directions.     And, unless you are&#13;
&#13;
       able to say "No" when No is the answer, you fail.&#13;
&#13;
       Q:   Going back to the Board, again, would you say that the&#13;
&#13;
       role of the Board has become stronger?     Has the Board become&#13;
&#13;
       more intrusive?    Has there been a shift in power and&#13;
&#13;
       influence from management to the Board?&#13;
&#13;
       A:   I would say that most of the power remains with&#13;
&#13;
       management.    However, the Board's role on policy matters is&#13;
&#13;
       much more prominent now, if only because under new&#13;
&#13;
       procedures, project discussions take much less time.     Country&#13;
&#13;
       discussions, country strategy, and policy papers now occupy&#13;
&#13;
       most of the Board's time.    So the opportunity to express&#13;
&amp;#12;,.Â·,   ~'   . Â·' -,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    shihata, Page 41&#13;
&#13;
                      views on broader issues is much greater now than in the past.&#13;
&#13;
                           Furthermore, management instructions to staff in the&#13;
&#13;
                      form of policy statements on controversial matters are now&#13;
&#13;
                      issued only after they are discussed in a Board seminar.&#13;
&#13;
                      This procedure gives the Board a role in what used to be the&#13;
&#13;
                      exclusive domain of management.   In the past, although the&#13;
&#13;
                      Board was supposed to rule on policy, management issued&#13;
&#13;
                      instructions to staff on policy matters, under so-called&#13;
&#13;
                      "OMSs" (Operational Manual Statements) and later on "ODs"&#13;
&#13;
                      (Operational Directives), without involving the Board.     There&#13;
&#13;
                      were OMSs dealing with important policy matters which became&#13;
&#13;
                      operational directives, but were never discussed in the&#13;
&#13;
                      Board.   Today, you can't do that without going to the Board&#13;
&#13;
                      at least for a seminar, so the opportunity for Board&#13;
&#13;
                      involvement is much greater.&#13;
&#13;
                      Q:   Well, thank you very much.   You've been very helpful.&#13;
&#13;
                      A:   Thank you.&#13;

            In May 1994, Ibrahim F. I. Shihata was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by William Becker and David Milobsky. During
            his tenure at the Bank from 1983 to 2000, Mr. Shihata worked
            in the following areas: as vice president and general
            counsel (1983-1994); as a member of the policy committee
            (1983-1994); as senior vice president and general counsel
            (1994-1999); and as secretary general for the International
            Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
            (1999-2000). He discusses dealing with all the
            responsibilities of a legal counsel of a development finance
            organization from personnel matters to international law
            issues. His transcript also concerns the relationship
            between the board and management under the direction of the
            presidents Alden Clausen, Barber Conable, and Lewis Preston.
