Transition to competition&#13;
Competition, rather than price caps, was un-&#13;
doubtedly the primary impetus for AT&amp;T's mod-&#13;
ernization effort. When Sprint began to advertise&#13;
its all-fiber network in the mid-1980s, AT&amp;T per-&#13;
ceived an urgent need to improve its network&#13;
to maintain the company's reputation for qual-&#13;
ity. But price caps have eased the transition to&#13;
streamlined regulation. Under ROR regulation,&#13;
a detailed cost allocation manual would have&#13;
had to be developed to ensure that prices in&#13;
markets not subject to streamlined regulation&#13;
covered the costs allocated to those markets.&#13;

Because of the altogether favorable experience&#13;

telecommunications suggests that price cap&#13;
regulation works well during an industry's tran-&#13;
sition to a competitive structure.&#13;
Price cap plans have the additional advantage&#13;
of being indexed to inflation. But even though&#13;
they adjust automatically to unexpected&#13;
changes in inflation, as occur often in devel-&#13;
oping countries, the adjustments do not fully&#13;
compensate for the effect of inflation on capi-&#13;
tal costs. Thus, where inflation is unstable, an&#13;
additional adjustment factor may be desirable.&#13;
This comparison of regulatory performance&#13;
suggests that developing countries are well&#13;
advised to avoid ROR regulation altogether and&#13;
to leapfrog to price caps. By doing so, they&#13;
can benefit from the greater efficiency incen-&#13;
tives of price cap regulation while avoiding the&#13;
administrative costs and difficulties of ROR&#13;
regulation. Hybrid regulation incorporating&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Price cap regulation uses a formula, set
            in advance, to determine the price increases for a
            firm's services for a period of several years. During
            this period, the firm may keep all the benefits of its
            incremental productivity gains. Customers can also benefit
            because the price cap formula may cause prices to rise less
            rapidly during the period. The sharpened incentives created
            may encourage the firm to offer innovative new services.
            After the period ends, regulators may order price reductions
            that reflect productivity gains during the period. This Note
            presents the advantages of using price cap over
            rate-of-return (ROR) in regulating telecommunications
            carriers. It reviews the U.S. experience with price caps,
            focusing primarily on federal regulation. It then briefly
            discusses the lessons of this experience for developing countries.
