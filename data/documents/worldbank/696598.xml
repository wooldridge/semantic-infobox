Description:                  of small enterprises and labor-intensive works; and (b) support&#13;
community infrastructure and services in partnership with NGOs and&#13;
local groups. This will be achieved through building on the strengths&#13;
of the 1993-96 phase of the SFD by supporting various programs&#13;
during 1997-2000, including labor-intensive works; community&#13;
development projects; small and micro-enterprise development; and&#13;
support to workers made redundant by public sector reform or&#13;

Economic Rate of Return:      It is difficult to estimate an ERR given the difficulty of quantifying&#13;
benefits of upgrading public health, environment, literacy and other&#13;
services. Based on a sample of projects financed during 1993-96 under&#13;
the first project, the ERR for the project activities for which benefits&#13;
are quantifiable, accounting for some 75 percent of project cost, is&#13;
estimated to be 21 percent (see Annex 5 for details). These estimates&#13;
should be treated with caution given the subjective nature of many&#13;
assumptions.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
1. BACKGROUND AND ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRST PHASE&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    In response to a difficult economic situation caused by falling oil prices and the Gulf War, Egypt embarked&#13;
on a broad economic adjustment program with support from the World Bank and the IMF. The main stabilization&#13;
goals have been met and provide a basis for sustainable economic growth. The principal problems which still&#13;
persist are high levels of poverty and unemployment. Between 20-30 percent of Egyptians are estimated to live in&#13;
poverty, and a recent survey found the unemployment rate, when adjusted for underemployment, to be close to 21&#13;
percent. Eighty-five percent of the unemployed are between 19 and 29 years of age, and most are recent graduates.&#13;
1.2    The high level of poverty is not just a social and equity issue: those factors which cause widespread&#13;
poverty also contribute substantially to the lack of broad-based growth.  Egypt has the potential to develop a&#13;
dynamic and forward-looking small enterprise sector which could lead to both broad-based employment generation&#13;
and poverty reduction. Egypt also has age-old social structures and community groups which are close to the&#13;
people (particularly the poor) and can play a strong role in the country's economic development. Broad based&#13;
economic growth that harnesses the energies of Egypt's small entrepreneurs and community organizations can also&#13;
help reduce the attraction of extremist political movements, thus contributing to political and social stability.&#13;
B. SOCIAL FUND: EVALUATION 1993-95 AND PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE StISTAINABILITY&#13;
1.3    Social Fund for Development (SFD): The SFD was set up in 1991 at the height of the Gulf crisis. Its&#13;
activities between 1993-96 (referred to as Phase I while Phase 11 refers to 1997-2000) was supported by many&#13;
donors including IDA through Credit No. C2276-EGT approved by the Board on June 21, 1991. This credit is&#13;
expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1996. The SFD was conceived with three objectives: (a) to help&#13;
reduce poverty through supporting employment generation and community development efforts; (b) to help mitigate&#13;
the possible negative impact of the Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program (ERSAP); and (c) to&#13;
provide help to the Gulf returnees. These objectives were to be achieved through five programs: Public Works&#13;
Program (PWP) to support labor intensive construction projects; Community Development Program (CDP)&#13;
including support for microenterprise and community based social services; Enterprise Development Program&#13;
(EDP) to help new and on-going small enterprises; Labor Mobility Program (LMP) to help labor adjust to economic&#13;
reform; and Institutional Development Program (IDP) to support the SFD secretariat as well as poverty monitoring&#13;
through surveys and studies. A review of SFD performance by the Government (SFD-Mission Beyond 1996,&#13;
October 1994) concluded that the SFD has been very successful. A more recent evaluation was done by the World&#13;
Bank based on information collected using the following methods: (a) extensive in-depth field visits; (b) impact&#13;
survey in five govemorates; and (c) review of administrative data from the SFD and its partners. The World Bank&#13;
evaluation confirmed the previous positive assessment of 1994, though it found that some areas needed&#13;
improvement. The evaluation findings are summarized below.&#13;
1.4    The SFD met its first objective. It was able to create 50,000-70,000 jobs per year, i.e. almost 25 percent of&#13;
annual non-agriculture jobs created. The SFD did this without crowding out the private sector, primarily by&#13;
supporting small enterprises which previously had no access to banks. The second objective was to be met by&#13;
helping workers made redundant through public enterprise restructuring or privatization. This objective was only&#13;
partially met as the pace of privatization/restructuring was slower than expected. The SFD also partly met the third&#13;
objective by creating employment opportunities for Gulf returnees. The SFD met its employment creation objectives&#13;
with annual expenditures equivalent to only 0.2 percent of GDP, or about 6 percent of annual donor flows to Egypt.&#13;
This job-creation cost compares favorably with other countries, based on data from various units within the World&#13;
Bank (see Table 1.1). SFD's achievements are given in Annex 5, and an assessment of its various programs&#13;
follows.&#13;

Box 1: How the SFD has an Inmpact on the Poor&#13;
The small dusty village in Fayoum lies close to the edge of the cultivated area, where green gives way to desert. At&#13;
the tail-end of a water distribution system running from a canal bringing Nile water, the village receives a lot of&#13;
contaminated water which has already passed through other places. SFD helped residents to build a waste water&#13;
treatment plant constructed with :local materials. Labor accounted; for over 50 percent of the cost. The villagers&#13;
contributed almost 25 percent in:cash. In the same village, the SFD helped develop a community center and runs a&#13;
women's adult literacy program.  The literacy program has been helping young girls who have dropped out of&#13;
school due to family financial pressures to learn reading, writing and arithmetic. In another part of Fayoum, a&#13;
young businessman with support from SFD has created ernployment opportunities for 10 women by setting up a&#13;
smaIll business to clean and repackage agriculture products. The businessman himself is not from the poorest group&#13;
of residents but his employees are.&#13;
1.5    Public Works Program (PWP): The objective of this program was to transfer income while developing&#13;
local infrastructure by creating employment through the use of labor intensive but efficient public works. The&#13;
program has met the objective of generating employment while constructing quality works in collaboration with&#13;
local Governments and communities. The principal problem encountered during Phase I has been operations and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) of SFD financed infrastructure. Though local Governments have provided assurances of&#13;
supporting operations and maintenance and Governors have included this in budget requests, resources have not&#13;
been forthcoming due to fiscal constraints. The SFD is developing an approach to involve local communities in&#13;
operations and maintenance. The proposed approach calls for setting up users associations, which would collect&#13;
voluntary contributions in cash or kind from beneficiaries. To encourage these associations, the SFD would provide&#13;
matching funds for maintenance activities on a downward sliding scale. (Annex I, para.14 provides details).&#13;
Box 2: Restoring Pride in a Forgotten Community&#13;
Toad village lies close tolEgypt's great tourist attractions around Luxor, but a visit there reveals living conditions&#13;
hard to imagine outside the:worst refugee camp. A survey indicated that 73 percent of children under 12 in the&#13;
village suffer from: intestinal infections and diseases. lTe main causes for this were identified as a lack of sanitary&#13;
habits, poor sanitation andT waste disposal and an. excess: of flies surprising even in this poor corner of Egypt. The&#13;
local Community Development Association had very limited resources and appealed to the SFD for help. The&#13;
SFD's community. development program designed :a program including: health and environmental awareness&#13;
campaigns, spraying of flies, construction of septic pits, and establishment of a mechanism for solid waste collection&#13;
and disposal.  .The. village remains poor but conditions: have improved, and the villagers are proud of the&#13;
improvements they have brought about in their lives.&#13;
1.6    Community Development Program  (CDP): The objective of this program  was to help the poorest&#13;
communities, giving priority to their most vulnerable members. The range of activities supported by the CDP&#13;
includes: (a) social services such as literacy classes, health care, family planning, etc.; (b) micro-enterprises to&#13;
increase the income of the poorest households; and (c) community centers which provide a base for social services&#13;
and recreational activities. In the course of its operations, the CDP has adopted a very participatory approach and is&#13;
also supporting the development of NGOs. About 73 percent of direct beneficiaries were rural, and 66 percent were&#13;
female. Two issues persist and need to be addressed during Phase II (refers to SFD between 1997-2000). The first&#13;
issue is providing sufficient resources to support O&amp;M of SFD financed activities. This issue is being addressed by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Egypt: Second Social Fund Project                                                               Page 3&#13;
establishing users' groups, as in the case of PWP, for each of the financed activities. The second issue is the lack of&#13;
market orientation for the CDP microenterprise and training activities: the CDP has sometimes provided training for&#13;
skills which are saturated or have no market. This problem will be addressed by closely monitoring local market&#13;
conditions before approving support for enterprises (Annex 2, para.32).&#13;
1.7    Enterprise Development Program (EDP): The objective of the EDP is to help create employment through&#13;
support for new and existing small enterprises by providing a package of technical assistance, training and credit.&#13;
The difference between the CDP and the EDP lending activities is that the average CDP loan is US$500 and credit&#13;
is extended through NGOs, while the EDP's average loan is US$4,000 and credit is extended through banks. Bank&#13;
lending is complemented by technical assistance and is provided through NGOs. Banks take the full commercial&#13;
risk of their lending and hence have sole loan decision authority. The program has disbursed over LE 700 million to&#13;
intermediaries for on-lending and has spent substantial additional resources to develop and deliver technical&#13;
assistance packages. Over 60,000 sub-loans are outstanding, and 25 percent of the borrowers are female.&#13;
1.8    Given current interest rates to final borrowers, as well as the spreads that the banks can charge, the interest&#13;
rate on a loan to an existing small business is slightly above inflation (spread of 3 percent) while the interest rate on&#13;
a loan to a new business is slightly below inflation (spread of 4 percent). Interest rates to final borrowers are&#13;
reviewed on a yearly basis. Repayment rates appear good, although this conclusion is based on limited data as&#13;
many sub-loans are still in the grace period. The banks started their first repayments to the EDP last summer and&#13;
these funds will be re-lent. About 40 percent of loans were for start-up enterprises and thus, the EDP program&#13;
provided access to the banking system for borrowers who otherwise would not have received a loan. In total,&#13;
120,000 permanent jobs were created (measured as a job still in existence one year after its creation). Forty-three&#13;
percent of loans are for small industry, 21 percent for services, 23 percent for agriculture and animal production,&#13;
and 11 percent for trade. Unemployed graduates are a priority target group of the EDP.&#13;
Box 3: Harnessing Egypt's Talentfor Entrepreneurship&#13;
Galal (name changed) leaves the shop area and, despite the fact that he has lost a leg, goes rapidly up a set of steep&#13;
stairs to his workshop. His small business in the market area of Aswan is thriving: he employs ten people making&#13;
clothing. This would have seemed an impossible dream when he joined the handicapped training programn jointly&#13;
offered by the SFD and the Ministry of Social Affairs. He completed his training and qualified for a small loan&#13;
under the productive families sub-project supported by SFD's community development program. His business&#13;
continued to grow and he has expanded with a loan from a bank through SFD's enterprise development program.&#13;
SFD support has helped this determined individual, and through him helped also his ten employees.&#13;
1.9    The EDP was designed primarily as a "job-creation" mechanism to assist entrepreneurs and to disburse&#13;
loans quickly and efficiently without much regard for issues affecting sustainability of the SFD itself. It has&#13;
successfully helped thousand of borrowers while operating under a set of (often conflicting) donor demands and&#13;
constraints. The EDP in effect acts as a successful wholesale small business support and finance agency, delivering&#13;
loans to small businesses through banks and delivering business services through NGOs. During the assessment of&#13;
Phase I of the program, it was agreed that the issue of sustainability needs to be addressed in Phase 11. This would&#13;
require that: (a) SFD on-lending to banks carries an interest rate sufficient to maintain the value of SFD funds in real&#13;
terms; (b) the cost of the services provided by SFD staff is recovered in the long-term, directly or indirectly, from&#13;
the banks/beneficiaries; (c) the banks have a sufficient spread to cover their costs, including an allowance for&#13;
default; and (d) the EDP, while maintaining its social objectives, is managed as a self-standing commercial program.&#13;
A Task Force including SFD staff, banks and donor representatives has been established to identify means of&#13;
achieving these goals, and it has issued a preliminary report which has been made available to the World Bank and&#13;
other donors. Thefindings of the Task Force has been developed into a business plan which was discussed during&#13;
negotiations; its execution has been included as a covenant in the Credit and Project Agreement (para. 5.2).&#13;
1.10    Labor Mobility Program (LMP): The objectives of this program were to provide workers in restructured&#13;
or privatized public sector enterprises with financial assistance, training and placement services. The original&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4                                                             Egypt: Second Social Fund Project&#13;
program was intended to help 50,000 workers at a cost of US$90 million. Since the Government's privatization&#13;
program moved considerably more slowly than was expected, the demand for LMP activities was limited and&#13;
donors agreed to reduce the program to US$40 million (with the funds being reallocated to other programs),&#13;
implicitly reducing the target to 20,000 workers. So far the program has assisted 3,000 workers in three enterprises&#13;
and is currently working on assisting an additional 10,000 workers in seven enterprises.&#13;
1.11   Institutional Development Program  (IDP):  The IDP's objectives included support for (a) SFD&#13;
management; and (b) poverty monitoring in collaboration with researchers and CAPMAS (Central Agency for&#13;
Public Mobilization and Statistics). The management of the SFD has been efficient (overhead costs are 6 percent of&#13;
disbursements). CAPMAS/SFD completed a survey (living standards measurement) in 1993 which provides data&#13;
for poverty analysis. The survey includes data to update price indices and the GDP deflator.&#13;
1.12    Gender Targeting: The SFD targets women as a special group for assistance: 25 percent of EDP loan&#13;
beneficiaries were women, which is higher than would be expected given Egypt's entrepreneurship patterns, and&#13;
compares favorably to other enterprise development activities which achieve a 10 percent target of support to&#13;
women. Over 60 percent of CDP beneficiaries were women, including a third of the micro-entrepreneurs.&#13;
C. SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE SOCIAL FUND&#13;
1.13    Managerial Autonomy: The SFD's managerial autonomy in terms of decision making, procurement and&#13;
disbursements is a major factor behind its success. The Board of Directors (BOD) and its Executive Committee&#13;
(EC) set policy and leave day to day management to the Managing Director.&#13;
1.14   Role of NGOs: NGOs play a prominent role in SFD programs, particularly in the areas of community&#13;
development (CDP) and enterprise development (EDP). Up to July 1995, NGOs managed LE 100 million out of LE&#13;
192 million approved for CDP sub-projects (52 percent), and LE 609 million out of LE 1,406 million approved for&#13;
EDP sub-projects (43 percent). Thus, the SFD has also been able to attain its objective of working in partnership&#13;
with NGOs. NGOs provide an essential link to communities and are able to articulate community concerns well.&#13;
Their role will become even more prominent in Phase II. Initially the SFD had to rely primarily on government&#13;
sponsored NGOs, but it has been able to broaden the range of NGOs it deals with and thus to broaden its appeal to&#13;
communities. Close collaboration with the main religious NGOs as well as with the Egyptian Red Crescent and the&#13;
Family Planning Association has helped the SFD to work with smaller NGOs and community groups through the&#13;
use of a mentor system. Many of these smaller NGOs are now working independently, mostly in poor rural areas&#13;
(NGO-SFD relations are discussed in Annexes 1, 2 and 3 in the context of various programs).&#13;
1.15   Role of Donors: Donors have played a major role in supporting the SFD in the past. This strong support&#13;
can be attributed to donor interest in supporting Egypt's poor and unemployed and also to the SFD's demonstrated&#13;
efficiency. SFD effectiveness has been recognized by many donors who provided funding, including the European&#13;
Union, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the Arab Fund, the Kuwait Fund,&#13;
the Abu Dhabi Fund, China and India. Many donors have pooled their funds with the World Bank Group during&#13;
Phase 1. Others have worked in parallel. Without this vigorous and sustained donor support, SFD's initial progress&#13;
would not have been possible.&#13;
D. R4TIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.16   The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Egypt discussed by the Board on March 24, 1994&#13;
recommended a strong emphasis on poverty reduction through development of human resources (see paragraphs 37-&#13;
42 of Report No. P-6263-EGT) and using the contribution of Egypt's small entrepreneurs. The World Bank has&#13;
taken a broad based approach in the social sectors and has supported projects in basic health and education. The&#13;
support to SFD is providing a vehicle to help reduce poverty and improve living conditions by creating employment&#13;
and supporting community development.  The proposed project will support activities designed to reduce&#13;
unemployment and increase growth by harnessing the productive capacity of Egypt's small entrepreneurs and&#13;
community groups. It also provides an important vehicle to support World Bank/NGO partnership.&#13;

1.17    The Government of Egypt requested the World Bank to take the lead in developing the project and in&#13;
convening the donors meeting because of the World Bank's : (i) global experience with social funds, (ii) technical&#13;
and financial support for Phase 1; and (iii) experience in mobilizing donor resources. The donors meeting was&#13;
chaired by the World Bank and was held on April 16th through 17th, 1996. The meeting was hosted by the&#13;
European Union at their headquarters in Brussels. The meeting was able to raise US$775 million for Phase II&#13;
including US$174 million from Egyptian sources. The IDA Credit has been a catalyst for raising US$481 million&#13;
from other donors.&#13;
2.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECrIVES&#13;
2.1    The project objectives are to help: (a) create jobs through support of small enterprises and labor intensive&#13;
works, and (b) support community infrastructure and services in partnership with NGOs and local groups. These&#13;
objectives would be accomplished through building on the strengths of the first phase of the SFD. The issues raised&#13;
in paragraphs 1.5 to 1.9 will be addressed to assure that the SFD is more sustainable, more highly targeted and more&#13;
efficient during Phase II.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.2    The proposed second phase of the SFD will include the following programs:&#13;
(a)    Small-scale Labor Intensive Works Program: The SLWP will build on the public works program,&#13;
with an increased focus on community partnership and targeting. Sub-projects will continue to be&#13;
executed in close cooperation with Governorates. the local branches of the relevant technical&#13;
Ministries and the concerned community.&#13;
(b)    Community Development Program: The CDP would build on the current program and continue&#13;
to focus on (i) community and NGO participation, (ii) capacity building and (iii) targeting of&#13;
women, the poor, and the unemployed. CDP sub-projects will continue to be executed in&#13;
partnership with NGOs and the beneficiary communities, with involvement of local authorities at&#13;
the planning stage.&#13;
(c)    Enterprise Development Program: The EDP has evolved into a credit program providing loans&#13;
to banks for on-lending to entrepreneurs and a technical assistance program for entrepreneurs&#13;
through NGOs. During implementation of Phase II, the EDP would be restructured according to a&#13;
business plan (agreed with the World Bank) designed to assure long-term sustainability.&#13;
(d)    Human Resource Development Program: The HRDP would build on the public enterprise labor&#13;
mobility program but extend its mandate to support labor mobility in private sector companies&#13;
affected by trade liberalization. The program would also provide support on a matching grant&#13;
basis to small enterprises that wish to train their workers. Grants would be transparent and would&#13;
be larger for skills with higher mobility. The labor mobility program would be executed in&#13;
partnership with the enterprise concerned, while training services would be provided under&#13;
contract by the private sector.&#13;
(e)    Institutional Development Program: The IDP would support SFD management as well as poverty&#13;
monitoring and other studies linked to poverty and social safety nets.  During Phase 11,&#13;
decentralization of functions would increase through transfer of responsibility for programs to&#13;
SFD's regional offices when feasible. This would allow even closer association with local&#13;
Governments than is now the case.&#13;

C. COST AND FINANCING&#13;
2.3    Costs: The project will be implemented over a four-year period. The total cost of the project is estimated&#13;
at US$775 million net of taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange cost of US$27 million. As summarized in Table&#13;
2.1, it is expected that US$92 million (12 percent) would be allocated to Small Scale Labor Intensive Works,&#13;
US$208 million (27 percent) to Community Development, US$354 million (46 percent) to Enterprise Development,&#13;
US$80 million (10 percent) to Human Resources Development, and US$40 million (5 percent) to Institutional&#13;
Development. No contingencies have been applied as the project supports envelopes for programs rather than&#13;
specific activities. Detailed project costs are shown in Annex 9.&#13;

2.4    Financing: The financing plan for Phase 11 was finalized during a donors meeting held in Brussels on&#13;
April 16-17, 1996. During the meeting, contributions of US$526 million dollars were confirmed by donors in&#13;
addition to the Government contribution. The following donors formalized contributions during the meeting: the&#13;
Arab Fund, Denmark, the European Union, France, Germany, the Kuwait Fund, the Netherlands, the United&#13;
Kingdom, IDA, and the UNDP. In addition, other donors such as the Abu Dhabi Fund, the African Development&#13;
Bank, Korea and Switzerland have confirmed their interest and are expected to add at least US$75 million. The&#13;
Egyptian Government pledged the equivalent of US$120 million, double their Phase I contribution. Egyptian&#13;
NGOs and beneficiaries are expected to contribute at least $54 million, so that the financing of Phase II would&#13;
include $174 million (22%) from domestic sources, and $601 (78%) million from external sources. Ninety percent&#13;
of total financing is confirmed. The proposed IDA credit of US$120 million would cover 15 percent of total Phase&#13;
11 costs. Other donors are expected to provide parallel financing for Phase II with the exception of the Netherlands&#13;
contribution of US$20 million which will be in the form of joint-cofinancing with IDA and will be disbursed&#13;
through IDA. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2.2 (the Arab Funds category in Table 2.2 includes the&#13;
Abu Dhabi Fund, the Arab Fund and the Kuwait Fund).&#13;

D. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Operating Procedures of SFD&#13;
2.5     The project will be implemented by SFD in accordance with its established procedures.  These are stated&#13;
in its Operational Manual, which was developed in consultation with the Government and donors. The mission&#13;
found the manual to be acceptable though occasional revisions will be required to take into account changing&#13;
conditions on the ground. During negotiations the borrower and SFD gave assurances that the statutes, by-laws&#13;
and operating procedures of SFD will remain acceptable to the World Bank Group at all times (para. 5.2).&#13;
2.6     The SFD executes projects in partnership with development partners - Govemorates, NGOs, commercial&#13;
banks and Ministries. Proposals for a wide range of activities are submitted to one of the SFD programs by partner&#13;
agencies. For example, a proposal could involve several rural roads and water supply systems for a particular&#13;
region. The activities, each of which is referred to as a sub-project, would be executed by SFD in cooperation with&#13;
the proposing agency. The package of proposals (called a sub-programn) could include activities such as a waste&#13;
water plant in one village, a road providing access to a second and a community center in a third. Individual&#13;
proposals are screened to assure that they do not replicate activities undertaken by other agencies or include&#13;
activities with harmful social or environmental side-effects. Sub-program proposals as a whole are then subjected to&#13;
economic and environmental analysis. Full economic and environmental analysis is required when sub-program&#13;
size exceeds US$500,000. Due to their small size, it is not possible to carry out this level of economic and&#13;
environmental analysis for most sub-project proposals. In these cases, a screening process is used to determine cost-&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
2.7     Sub-project Cycle. The SFD initiates and accepts sub-project proposals submitted by sponsoring agencies&#13;
(SA) to any ten of the regional or six satellite offices. Selection of proposals is based on two sets of criteria. The&#13;
first is contained in guidelines focusing on regional allocations which are established in the Operational Manual.&#13;
These regional allocations are based on the distribution of poverty and are made for public works and community&#13;
development sub-projects only. For public works, the regional authorities set priorities on the basis of both poverty&#13;
within the region and demand from communities, while for community development, NGOs play a much greater&#13;
FThis report uses the following terms: project refers to the overall Second Social Fund Project, program refers to specific SFD programns&#13;
such as Public Works, Community Development etc., sub-program denotes the group of activities within a defined area carried out in&#13;
partnership with one implementing agency and the term sub-project is applied to specific activities such as a road or a community center.&#13;
SFD itself uses the word project for what is called a sub-program here and the word activity for what is called a sub-project here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

role in identification (see Annexes I and 2 for process and Annex 6 for criteria). After preliminary screening by the&#13;
regional and satellite offices, acceptable sub-projects are forwarded to the national office for a detailed desk and&#13;
field appraisal.  Sub-project appraisal at the national office emphasizes technical feasibility and social and&#13;
institutional analysis as well as simplified economic and environmental analysis. Two types of criteria apply. In&#13;
addition to meeting the criteria contained in the Operational Manual for regional allocations, proposals are evaluated&#13;
for cost-efficiency, level of community commitment as expressed by contributions in cash or kind, and geographical&#13;
balance (with a bias towards poorer areas). During Phase If the Operational Manual will be updated and revised&#13;
following periodic consultations with the World Bank Group and other donors. The objective of these revisions is&#13;
to refine SFD procedures in light of experience gained in Phase I so that the effectiveness of its operations may be&#13;
increased. Criteria which have been tested and proven to be effective will be added, while care is taken to avoid&#13;
adding so many of these criteria that rapid execution might be hampered. During negotiations assurances were&#13;
received that the SED Operctional MUanual will be periodically reviewed and updated in consultation with the&#13;
World Bank Group (para. 5.2).&#13;
2.8     The average time for sub-project processing, from reception of a sub-project proposal to approval, has&#13;
averaged about 4.5 months while the average implementation period for sub-projects has been 12 to 18 months.&#13;
Upon formal approval of a sub-project, a framework agreement is drawn up between SFD and each Sponsoring&#13;
Agency (SA) specifying the responsibilities of each party; procurement methods; implementation schedules;&#13;
financial terms and conditions, the SA contribution; supervision; and handover mechanisms.&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
2.9     Project monitoring indicators are provided in Table 2.3. Because the SFD is a demand driven institution,&#13;
actual outputs are subject to change: the estimates in Table 2.3 were derived from Phase I experiences. In addition&#13;
to the indicators in Table 2.3, the SFD's monitoring system (described in Annex 7) will generate a wide range of&#13;
information to provide SFD management and donors with the information necessary to measure progress, targeting&#13;
and efficiency. In addition to process monitoring, impact monitoring would be done through surveys, beneficiary&#13;
assessments, and complementary studies. This will provide continuous feedback on SFD impact on beneficiaries.&#13;
These surveys are done under contract by research institutes and not by SFD staff. The first impact surveys have&#13;
been completed.&#13;

sources of funds for each sub-project; (c) SFD staffing, indicating any changes that may have taken place; and (d)&#13;
operating costs. Annual financial and technical audits will provide independent information.&#13;

Planned Reviews&#13;
2.11   Impact assessments and related studies will be complemented by a mid-term review aimed at assessing the&#13;
administrative, financial and technical aspects of sub-projects as well as the institutional efficiency of SFD.&#13;
Specifically, the review will: (a) evaluate project performance during implementation; (b) provide management with&#13;
feedback on project achievements and shortcomings; and (c) document the status of project execution for the benefit&#13;
of the Borrower and the financing agencies.  Following the mid-term review, agreed corrective actions will be&#13;
implemented expeditiously. In addition to the mid-term review, Annual Implementation Reviews (AIR) would be&#13;
conducted by the SFD, donors and the World Bank Group. These reviews would analyze: (a) financial performance&#13;
and budget execution against projected targets; (b) workplan and budget proposals for the following year; (c)&#13;
recurrent budget implications of SFD investments; (d) adjustments required in project design and implementation&#13;
schedule; and (e) results of evaluation studies and indicators on sub-project quality and impact.&#13;
2.12    During negotiations the Government gave assurances that it and the World Bank Group will carry out an&#13;
annual review of project implementation not later than November 30 each year on the basis of appropriate&#13;
documentation prepared by SFD that would include the budget and work-plan proposals for the following year.&#13;
During negotiations assurances were also received that the World Bank Group and the Government would carry out&#13;
a mid-term review no later than November 30, 1998 to: (a) evaluate the impact of sub-projects on beneficiaries and&#13;
the sustainability of sub-projects; and (b) make recommendations on thefuture orientation of the SFD. Assurances&#13;
were given that the Government would implement all actions agreed with the World Bank Group as a result of the&#13;
mid-term review. It is understood that the mid-term review will replace the annual review in 1998 (para.5.2).&#13;
Assurances were also given that SFD would submit semi-annual progress reports to the World Bank Group, not&#13;
later than three months after the end of each semester (para. 5.2).&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
2.13   The SFD is now one of the most effective implementation agencies for World Bank/IDA projects in Egypt,&#13;
reducing the need for close supervision.  Supervision will focus on continuing program  assessment and&#13;
sustainability. Several key conditionalities would be monitored through World Bank Group supervision, including&#13;
implementation of the EDP business plan and periodic revisions of the SFD manual. The proposed project would&#13;
be supervised jointly by the Headquarters staff and resident mission staff with the latter being responsible for&#13;
routine procurement and disbursement matters. The Task Manager will provide support on policy matters and carry&#13;
out supervision missions. Due to the importance of EDP transformation, a World Bank specialist in enterprise&#13;
development will be used regularly. Supervision for Phase II is expected to be combined with that for Phase I until&#13;
the closing date. For the two projects combined, it is expected that during FY97 about forty staff weeks will be&#13;
needed to assist in the transfornation of the EDP, resolution of the O&amp;M issue and the revision of procedures for&#13;
CDP microenterprise development and training. The need for supervision resources is expected to drop to 20 staff&#13;
weeks in FY98. The European Union plans to place two international experts in Egypt to supervise Phase I.&#13;
E. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
2.14   Three aspects of the project need to be considered with regard to sustainability: the SFD as an institution,&#13;
its sub-programs, and individual sub-projects. Sustainability of the SFD as an institution in the intermediate horizon&#13;
is assured, as donor interest and support remain high. The SFD is proving to be an important vehicle to help the&#13;
central authorities work with regional authorities: it has shown very good results on the ground and in helping to&#13;
build capacity at the regional and local government level and has developed into one of the most efficient and&#13;
effective agencies in the country. Several Ministries, including Education, Health and Population and Public Works&#13;
have requested that it help execute their own programs. While many SFD activities can be transferred to local&#13;
authorities over time and parts of the SFD such as EDP can become financially sustainable, the World Bank's global&#13;
experience indicates that this will happen very slowly and the need for SFD will continue over a fairly long time.&#13;
The Government's long-term commitment to SFD is evident through the increase of its financing share for Phase I.&#13;
Strong donor support was confirmed by the successful donor meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 10                                                                   Egypt: Second Social Fund Project&#13;
2.15    During Phase 11, the SFD's enterprise development program is expected to gradually become financially&#13;
sustainable. The labor mobility support to be provided by the human resources program is designed to meet a&#13;
transitory need and would eventually be phased out. Activities included in the labor intensive works and&#13;
community development programs should eventually be moved to local and regional Governments, once Egypt&#13;
completes its decentralization process. The SFD supports the decentralization process by helping to build local&#13;
capacity to develop and execute projects of interest to communities. The sustainability of individual CDP/SLWP&#13;
sub-projects would be assured by selecting proposals which are both carefilly screened and have strong beneficiary&#13;
support manifested by contributions in cash or kind. During negotiations, the SFD gave assurances that it would&#13;
develop a program for improving O&amp;M of CDP/SLWP projects by December 31, 1997 (para.5.2). The&#13;
sustainability of the investments financed by EDP would be assured by the application of commercial financial and&#13;
business principles in their selection and approval.&#13;
F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
2.16    Procurement under the project will be carried out in accordance with World Bank Procurement Guidelines&#13;
using standardized local bidding procedures and contract forms developed by SFD and agreed with the Bank.&#13;
Procurement during Phase I has proven to be economic and efficient, and procurement during Phase 11 will build on&#13;
Phase I experience. The SFD and the Sponsoring Agency (local government and NGO) would jointly procure&#13;
goods and civil works for sub-projects. This approach, shown to be transparent and fair during Phase 1, results in&#13;
the selection of the lowest bidder. The SFD's procurement arrangements under the existing framework agreement&#13;
require packaging of sub-projects only when significant implementation efficiencies would result. Table 2.4&#13;
summarizes the project components, their estimated costs and the proposed method of procurement. Most activities&#13;
to be financed during Phase 11 are currently on-going and using Phase I resources. Phase 11 activities can start&#13;
immediately.&#13;

Egypt: Second Social Fund Project                                                         Page 11&#13;
2.17    Procurement for SFD Sub-Projects: Procurement under EDP loans will follow commercial practices.&#13;
These are relatively small loans (averaging under $4,000) and it is expected that the recipients would shop prudently&#13;
and according to their needs. Civil Works undertaken by the SFD will include: expansion of potable water&#13;
networks, construction of rural roads and cleaning public irrigation canals. Civil works contracts will include small&#13;
works usually not exceeding US$150,000 in dispersed communities. Due to the nature of the works and the&#13;
difficulty of large packaging, it is not expected that any work contract exceeding this amount will reach a size large&#13;
enough to justify ICB. Civil works between US$150,000 to US$3 million would be awarded through National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB), but foreign contractors will not be precluded. Contracts between US$50,000 and&#13;
US$150,000 will be procured through NCB with bid advertisement within the Governorate only. Civil works under&#13;
US$50,000 would be procured through community contracting and such contracts will not exceed an aggregate of&#13;
US$3 million. Goods and equipment to be financed by the IDA Credit include primarily materials for social&#13;
services, e.g. medicines, educational materials, etc. No contracts for goods and equipment are expected to exceed&#13;
US$300,000. Goods and equipment contracts with an estimated value not to exceed US$5,000,000 would be&#13;
purchased through International Shopping or UN Procurement agencies (as permitted under para. 3.9 of the&#13;
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits of January, 1995). Due to the efficiencies&#13;
achieved through using local shopping contracts under the SFD Phase I, continued use of local shopping during&#13;
Phase 11 will apply to contracts under US$50,000 up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $3,300,000.&#13;
2.18   Technical Assistance and Training: Technical assistance and training will cover services to help small&#13;
entrepreneurs, support for community social services and feasibility studies for sub-projects. Consultants will be&#13;
appointed following the World Bank's Consultant Guidelines and will be recruited locally through competitive&#13;
selection. Consultant assignments will include monitoring, evaluation and administrative support to the SFD. Egypt&#13;
has qualified local consulting firms with the expertise required to carry out these functions, including knowledge of&#13;
local dialects and traditions.&#13;
2.19    Procurement Review Thresholds: Bidding packages for IDA financed contracts above the threshold of&#13;
US$500,000 for civil works and US$250,000 for goods and equipment would be subject to prior review procedures.&#13;
The threshold for prior review of consultant services would be US$100,000 for contracts with consulting firms,&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals and all sole source contracts and terms of reference regardless of the contract value. All&#13;
other contracts will be subject to selective post award review. The SFD will be responsible for following&#13;
monitoring procedures and for maintaining proper records for easy review by IDA. It is expected that two thirds of&#13;
NCB contracts for civil works and one third of NCB contracts for goods and equipment will be subject to post&#13;
award review.&#13;
G. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
2.20   The proposed credit would be disbursed over a period of about four years and would be completed by&#13;
December 31, 2000, the project completion date. This disbursement pace is faster than other projects in Egypt but&#13;
consistent with Phase I experience. The last date for presentation of sub-projects by SFD to the World Bank Group&#13;
would be June 30, 2000. The closing date of the IDA Credit would be June 30, 2001.&#13;

2.21    Estimated disbursements by IDA fiscal year are shown in Table 2.5.  There would be only one&#13;
disbursement category: SFD sub-projects and disbursements would be 100 percent of amounts disbursed to&#13;
implementing agencies against statements of expenditures for all contracts up to the limits for prior review (para.&#13;
2.18). Contributions by the implementing agency and by entrepreneurs are expected to cover taxes and other costs.&#13;

2.22    To ensure that funds are readily available, SFD would open a Special Account in a commercial bank on&#13;
terms and conditions satisfactory to the World Bank. An initial deposit of US$12 million, corresponding to about&#13;
four months of expenditures under the project, would be advanced to the account from the IDA credit. The Special&#13;
Account would be replenished monthly, or after one third of the initial deposit amount has been disbursed,&#13;
whichever is sooner. During negotiations the Government agreed that the Special Account and the SOEs would be&#13;
audited in conjunction with the annual audit of SFD's accounts (para 5.2).&#13;
H. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
2.23   Independent external auditors, acceptable to the World Bank, would conduct annual financial and&#13;
functional audits of SFD. Functional audits would examine a sample of sub-programs and sub-projects, review&#13;
individual contracts and compliance with contract terms, inspect the progress of civil works, reconcile the physical&#13;
progress with the financial expenses incurred, and state whether procurement guidelines were being followed. The&#13;
reports would be submitted to the SFD Board not later than three months after the end of the fiscal year. Annual&#13;
audit reports would cover SFD's balance sheets and income statements and include the auditor's assessment of the&#13;
financial statements, as well as separate opinions on: (a) project accounts; (b) SOEs; (c) the Special Account; (d)&#13;
whether procurement of all contracts was carried out in accordance with agreed guidelines; (e) the adequacy of the&#13;
intemal controls system; and (f) the sample of sub-projects examined to see whether SFD guidelines are followed.&#13;
At negotiations, the Government gave assurances that: independent auditors, acceptable to the World Bank Group,&#13;
would conduct annual audits of SFD's accounts, and annual technical and managerial audits of SFD's operations;&#13;
and that SFD would submit certified copies of the annual audit reports, which would include any adverse material&#13;
findings and an annual summary of the quarterly functional audits no later than six months following the end of the&#13;
Government's fiscal year (para. 5.2).&#13;
2.24    The SFD would maintain consolidated accounts for the entire project, and detailed accounts for individual&#13;
sub-project grants. Sponsoring agencies would be required by the sub-project agreement to establish appropriate&#13;
accounting systems. The SFD would assist sponsoring agencies in developing appropriate accounting procedures.&#13;
3.  THE PROJECT EXECUTION AGENCY&#13;
3.1    The SFD was established by presidential decree in 1991. It is an autonomous agency with legal personality&#13;
as well as technical, financial and administrative flexibility. It reports directly to the President of the Republic. The&#13;
organization did not become fully operational until early 1993. The SFD Board of Directors (BOD) acts as a&#13;
technical steering committee. It is chaired by the Prime Minister, and is comprised of fifteen members, including&#13;
eight ministers and seven representatives from the private sector. Ministerial representation on the BOD eliminates&#13;
duplication of efforts and ensures adherence to sector priorities. The BOD sets SFD's operational guidelines,&#13;
prioritizes its annual budgets and financial contributions and authorizes disbursements.&#13;
3.2    The Executive Committee (EC), chaired by the chairman of the BOD, consists of eight members from the&#13;
private sector. The EC evaluates projects submitted to the SFD prior to presentation to the BOD, and is authorized&#13;
to approve projects from US$500,000 to US$3 million. Acting on behalf of the BOD, the EC also approves&#13;
guidelines for manuals and sub-projects, establishes guidelines for implementation of projects approved by the&#13;
BOD, delineates resource availability, and maintains regular contact with donors. Day to day operations of the SFD&#13;
are the responsibility of the Managing Director (MD), who is appointed by the Board. He approves sub-projects of&#13;
less than US$500,000, authorizes all disbursements and prepares progress reports and presents these to the BOD.&#13;
The MD heads a staff of 133 people, distributed into departments by sub-project themes, as well as administrative&#13;
and support services (see Annex 6 for details).&#13;
3.3    The SFD's well-defined administrative structure contributes to its efficient management. The current&#13;
structure will largely be retained, but will place a stronger emphasis on the demand driven approach and on&#13;
decentralization of authority and functions. The main office in Cairo sets overall strategy, prepares technical plans&#13;
and budgets for sub-projects, handles financial transactions, and provides operational support and guidance to ten&#13;
regional and six satellite offices outside of Cairo. These offices are the main point of contact between requesting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Egypt: Second Social Fund Project                                                                   Page 13&#13;
agencies and the SFD. They provide advice to communities, NGOs and regional governments on SFD procedures,&#13;
process applications, conduct appraisals, and support implementation.&#13;
3.4     SFD financed sub-projects have been implemented rapidly and efficiently, with operating costs averaging 6&#13;
percent of total disbursements. This figure compares favorably with other Social Funds (Senegal and Nicaragua are&#13;
at 5 percent, Bolivia at 5.5, and Honduras at 10 percent). Fifty percent of operating costs are allocated to the&#13;
enterprise development component, 22 percent to the community development component, 20 percent to the public&#13;
works, 6 percent to human resources development, and 2 percent to institutional development. Over a period of&#13;
three years, the SFD contracted 200 sub-projects for a total value of US$370.52 million, with an average of US$1.86&#13;
million per project.3 Of the US$204 4 million received from donors, US$191 has been disbursed, representing 94&#13;
percent of available funds.&#13;
3.5     The SFD's efficiency is explained by its: (a) effective management style; (b) status outside the civil&#13;
service; (c) administrative structure, which has clearly delineated lines of responsibility and accountability; (d)&#13;
partnership with local communities, close association with NGOs and local governments; and (e) use of&#13;
standardized project types, which simplifies project preparation and processing. The acceptance rate is 65-70&#13;
percent of proposals submitted, which is comparable with other social funds.&#13;
4. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT&#13;
A. BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
4.1     The project is expected to have significant benefits in terms of employment creation and in helping lower-&#13;
income families through enhanced income generation. Based on Phase I experience, it is estimated that the project&#13;
would create 200,000 permanent and 80,000 temporary jobs. The results of a beneficiary profile survey carried out&#13;
in five Governorates show that SFD beneficiaries are poorer than the population at large, thus confirming the&#13;
validity of the SFD's approach. Overall, it is estimated that the project would help raise the incomes of I to 1.5&#13;
million people.&#13;
4.2     In addition to its direct impact on poverty, the project would have two other significant benefits. First, it&#13;
would create significant social and economic infrastructure in the poorer communities. Second, the active&#13;
involvement of NGOs and local communities in all aspects of sub-projects through Phase I has given a strong sense&#13;
of empowerment to people who may otherwise have felt disfranchised. By continuing this in Phase II, the project&#13;
would contribute to social stability. In this respect, SFD has been a model for other programs in Egypt.&#13;
4.3     Economic Evaluation: It is difficult to calculate an ERR for the overall project given the difficulty of&#13;
quantifying the benefits of some of its activities, such as upgrading public health and the environment and providing&#13;
job-training. Nevertheless, the SFD attempts to quantify benefits wherever possible, using measures of willingness&#13;
to pay for community services; estimates of travel cost savings (roads); rental values (community buildings); and&#13;
enhanced prospects for earnings (technical training and enterprise development). A minimum threshold rate of&#13;
return of 12 percent is required for sub-project approval. Based on a sample of projects financed during Phase I,&#13;
and extrapolating across the entire program, the rate of return for activities with quantifiable benefits (which&#13;
account for 75 percent of project cost), is estimated to be 21 percent (see annex 5 for details). This estimate should&#13;
be treated with caution given that is based on subjective assumptions. Sensitivity analysis indicates a rate of return&#13;
of 15 percent would prevail even if the benefit estimates were reduced by 20%.&#13;
2&#13;
US$191 million have been disbursed through sponsoring agencies.&#13;
3&#13;
There is an active pipeline of sub-project requests totaling US$241 million.&#13;
4&#13;
Committed resources from the 17 donors is in the amount of USS613.1 million. However, the actual flow of funds to SFD started in March&#13;
1993 and reached USS204 million by September 30, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 14                                                                 Egypt: Second Social Fund Project&#13;
4.4     Besides ERR, the SFD also uses measures of cost-effectiveness to review sub-projects. It ensures that sub-&#13;
project costs and cost per beneficiary are within sub-sector norms. As indicated previously, the cost per job created&#13;
of UJS$1,401 compares favorably with other social funds.&#13;
B. RisKs&#13;
4.5     The main risks are that the SFD would: (a) become less efficient; and (b) lose its beneficiary orientation.&#13;
The first risk will be reduced by (i) increasing decentralization, (ii) continuing to rely on staff with performance&#13;
linked contracts; and (iii) continuing to increase transparency. The second risk will be reduced by (i) continuous&#13;
beneficiary assessments; (ii) establishing an independent client relations unit; and (iii) using frequent encounter&#13;
sessions with key partners including regional governments, NGOs and community groups.&#13;
4.6    The risks in the public works program include: (a) not targeting the poor; and (b) negative environmental&#13;
sidc-effects. The first risk will be mitigated by focusing on poor areas and requiring a labor intensive approach.&#13;
I'he second risk is mitigated by requiring environmental screening for sub-projects.&#13;
-I 2    I'he main risk in the communit, developnment program  is that the SFD could determine priorities for&#13;
communities and the program's key partners such as NGOs, rather than allow them to take the lead in identification&#13;
(f sub-programs and specific activities. This risk will be minimized by continuous application of participatory&#13;
processes as described in section "'C" below.&#13;
4i.8    The principal risk for the enterprise development program is one of sustainability at both the program&#13;
level and the individual enterprise level. Program sustainability will be assured by the structural revisions in the&#13;
.DP discussed in Sections 1 and 2. Individual enterprise sustainability will be assured through careful screening of&#13;
proposals and through appropriate provision of technical support and training to the entrepreneurs.&#13;
4.9     The main risk for the human resources development program is that training may not focus on labor&#13;
market needs. This risk is reduced by supporting only training requested by enterprises.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS AND PARTICIPATION&#13;
.4.10    Environment: The project has been rated category "B." The public works program and the community&#13;
development program will support community infrastructure through financing sub-projects requested by&#13;
conimunities.  These sub-projects range from  waste water treatment and rural roads to community centers.&#13;
Sub-projects in waste management may also be supported.  All sub-project proposals will be subjected to&#13;
environmental screening criteria and larger sub-projects will be subject to detailed environmental analysis.&#13;
Community participation and leadership is essential in approval of sub-projects. The project will work in close&#13;
consultation with NGOs and community groups.&#13;
4. 1I    Participatory Approach: Although the SFD has employed a participatory approach throughout Phase 1,&#13;
this approach has not been implemented systematically. This issue has been addressed through project preparation,&#13;
and systematic beneficiary assessments and focus group meetings are expected to be employed during Phase 11.&#13;
Extensive consultations with regional and local authorities now take place regularly. Sessions in which the SFD's&#13;
partners (such as NGOs and communities) can express their opinions freely will also be used on a regular basis.&#13;
5. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
Before negotiations, the Government and SFD  provided a draft business plan for the long-term&#13;
,,itainability of SFD's enterprise development program. The plan was discussed and agreed upon during technical&#13;
discussions preceding negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Egypt: Second Social Fund Project                                                         Page 15&#13;
5.2    During negotiations the following agreements were received:&#13;
(a)    The business plan for EDP transformation will be executed during Phase TI and will not be&#13;
modified without prior approval of the World Bank Group (para 1.9);&#13;
(b)    The SFD Operational Manual will be reviewed periodically with the World Bank Group and will&#13;
remain acceptable to the World Bank Group at all times (para 2.7);&#13;
(c)    The SFD will develop a strategy for improving operations and maintenance of public works and&#13;
community development projects by December 31, 1997 (para. 2.15);&#13;
(d)    The statutes and by-laws of SFD will remain acceptable to World Bank Group throughout project&#13;
implementation (para 2.5);&#13;
(e)    The borrower will carryout, not later than November 30 each year and jointly with the World&#13;
Bank Group, an annual review of project implementation on the basis of appropriate&#13;
documentation prepared by SFD that would include the budget and work-plan for the following&#13;
year (para. 2.12);&#13;
(f)    The borrower will: (i) carry out, jointly with the World Bank Group, a mid-term review not later&#13;
than November 30, 1998; (ii) submit to the World Bank Group a report by consultants not later&#13;
than four weeks prior to the review; and (iii) implement the recommendations of the mid-term&#13;
review (para 2.12); and&#13;
(g)    The borrower will submit to the World Bank Group, the following audit reports: (i) financial&#13;
audits annually, with the report to be submitted within six months of the close of the fiscal year;&#13;
and (ii) technical and managerial audits to be submitted within six months of the close of the fiscal&#13;
year (para. 2.19).&#13;
5.3    Recommendation: Subject to the above terms and conditions, the proposed project would be suitable for&#13;
a credit of SDR82.3 million (US$120.0 equivalent) to the Arab Republic of Egypt on standard IDA terms with a 35&#13;
year maturity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1: PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM&#13;
I.     Background. The Public Works Program component (PWP) of the Egypt Social Fund was designed to: (i)&#13;
initiate and stimulate a program of actions aimed at softening both the initial adverse effects of the reform process&#13;
and the negative impacts of the Gulf crisis on Egypt; and (ii) establish mechanisms to protect selected target&#13;
population groups (e.g., displaced public enterprise workers, households headed by females, and unskilled and&#13;
semi-skilled unemployed workers) in Egypt from the possible longer-term adverse effects of adjustment.&#13;
2.     In order to meet its mandate the PWP undertook construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of essential&#13;
municipal services in areas facing budgetary contraction, high incidence of poverty and unemployment. PWP sub-&#13;
projects were carried out by local private contractors using local labor, and included construction and rehabilitation&#13;
of water supply and sewerage systems, streets and rural roads, irrigation and drainage canals etc; and maintenance&#13;
such as cleaning canals, public buildings, solid waste collection and disposal. PWP sub-projects were able to&#13;
generate substantial temporary and permanent employment opportunities, provide essential basic infrastructure,&#13;
generate commitment and generate contributions, foster a collaborative working relationship between various&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
3.     PWP Targeting and Allocation of Resources. The PWP targeting was based on a social and economic&#13;
study carried out in 1991. The allocation of funds was based on population size and ranking of rural areas by means&#13;
of a combined index for poverty and unemployment. Based on total funds for PWP of LE 465.6 million, the&#13;
allocation to governorates ranged from LE 51.1 million for Sohag (the highest) to LE 1. I million for the Red Sea&#13;
(the lowest). Upper Egypt, which is the region of highest priority received LE 294.9 million (about 60 percent);&#13;
Lower Egypt, received LE 158.1 million (about 37 percent), and the Border Governorates, which due to their low&#13;
population base, received LE 12.6 million (about 3 percent).'&#13;
4.     The Main Results of the PWP Program. PWP activities were successful in meeting one of it's primary&#13;
objectives: employment generation in poor rural communities. By the end 1995, about 4 1 0,000 M/m temporary&#13;
jobs and about 2, 1 00 permanent positions were created in Upper Egypt (which correspond to contracted works&#13;
amounting to an estimated LE 337.48 million). 280,000 m/m temporary jobs and about 1,500 permanent positions&#13;
were created in Lower Egypt (which correspond to contracted works amounting about LE 206.84 million), and&#13;
16,000 m/m temporary jobs and about 80 permanent positions were created in the Border Governorates (which&#13;
correspond to contracted works amounting about LE 12.6 million). The average cost of creating temporary&#13;
employment opportunities, expressed in man-months, is estimated at about LE 820 in Upper Egypt, about LE 738 in&#13;
Lower Egypt and about LE 787 in the Border govemorates. The average cost of labor in public works is estimated&#13;
at about 30 percent of the total cost, which compares well with the average salary for unskilled or semi-skilled labor&#13;
(about LE 200-250/month).&#13;
5.     The principal conclusions of the program are as follows:&#13;
(a)   (i) Projects were demand driven; (ii) targeting of poor community groups within the govemorate was&#13;
undertaken; (iii) focus on the provision of essential infrastructure rehabilitation of public buildings was&#13;
accomplished (schools, clinics, youth centers and community development centers); (iv) operations and&#13;
maintenance costs were clearly spelt out in the framework agreement; (v) PWP activities have been labor&#13;
intensive; and (vi) community contributions (10 percent in cash/kind) have been an integral aspect of sub-&#13;
project selection;&#13;
(b)    Local employment opportunities have been invited as have local small size construction industries.&#13;
The labor component ranged from 30 percent (for rural roads) to 50 percent (for canal covering) of total&#13;
construction cost depending upon the nature of the works; the work was widely distributed among local small&#13;
contractors; and the average administrative cost ranged from 2 to 4 percent of the construction cost, which is&#13;
below the generally accepted figure of 5 percent. A comparison of average unit cost of construction of SFD&#13;
Since Alexandria does not include rural areas, funds for public works activities were not allocated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
funded versus Government funded projects of similar size and type of works, indicated that such costs are&#13;
about the same and minor difference may be due to quality control and extent of supervision;&#13;
(c)   It is difficult to measure the quantitative social, economic and environmental impact of SFD projects&#13;
in rural communities for two reasons. First, there is no base line data to determine the conditions prior to&#13;
project implementation. Second, it is costly and time consuming to survey the social, economic and&#13;
environmental conditions for each sub-project. Furthermore, the impact generated from the diverse types of&#13;
projects would produce varying and inconsistent results. Some data would depend on information obtained&#13;
from the beneficiaries and such data may not be reliable; therefore, the only objective assessment would&#13;
entail a qualitative evaluation to determine whether positive improvements would be enjoyed by&#13;
beneficiaries. To date, the SFD has conducted studies in ten governorates prior to project implementation,&#13;
and two studies following project completion (in Menoufiya and Gharbiya). The Gharbiya study, indicated&#13;
that beneficiary willingness to contribute to projects increased from 17 percent prior to project&#13;
implementation and 30 percent following project completion. The study farther indicated a change in&#13;
priorities as a result in a perceived changed in the economic benefits (beneficiary's satisfaction change to 87&#13;
percent for roads and 50 percent for water supply);&#13;
(d)    NGOs including local development associations (LDAs), are active participants in the PWP complete&#13;
sub-project cycle. The bulk of participating NGOs consist of social care (child and elderly) and social&#13;
development (women activities, literacy, and vocational training). The participation of NGOs and LDAs&#13;
ensure timely implementation of sub-projects, foster capacity building, and supervision of works; and&#13;
(e)    Theoretically, operations and maintenance are ensured within the budget of line ministries during&#13;
sub-project preparation and implementation. A similar commitment is obtained from the sponsoring&#13;
agencies and beneficiaries and spelt out in the framework agreement. In practice, the issue of sustainability&#13;
has not been tested. Nevertheless, given the current economic austerity being faced by the Government, the&#13;
availability of funds for O&amp;M has become questionable. Involving LDAs in O&amp;M should be encouraged&#13;
and incorporated into the framework agreements, in order to ensure community participation and stakeholder&#13;
commitment, especially given of the budgetary contractions.&#13;
PWP Procedures for Sub-Project Management&#13;
6.     The submission of the PWP sub-project proposal by a sponsoring agency marks the first stage of the sub-&#13;
project cycle. Govenorates develop a list of projects based on requests received from communities through district&#13;
offices. The SFD screens the list of projects and identifies eligible sub-projects based upon the established selection&#13;
criteria. The screening process involves an evaluation by a PWP Committee in the PWP department. Following&#13;
clearance, the proposal is presented to the SFD Executive Committee (SFD/EC) for final approval. The SFD/EC&#13;
approval is followed by a framework agreement signed by both parties, the SFD and the Sponsoring Agency. Prior&#13;
to sub-project implementation, the SFD appoints a project manager who assumes full responsibility for project&#13;
supervision (monitoring progress and making payments to Intermediary Agencies). Generally more than one&#13;
Intermediary Agency is involved at the governorate level (e.g., water supply department, roads department,&#13;
irrigation department, etc.) and agreements are established between each Intermediary Agency and the project&#13;
manager. The Intermediary Agency becomes the party responsible for contracting out the works to Executing&#13;
Agencies (local private contractors, NGOs, beneficiaries).&#13;
7.     The SFD tranches are forwarded directly to an account controlled by the project manager, who in turn&#13;
authorizes payments to Intermediary Agencies' accounts for payments to Executing Agencies (contractors).&#13;
Contractors are paid by Intermediary Agencies based on disbursement applications for works completed according&#13;
to the contractual agreements. Fund transfers are not made through the Sponsoring Agency (Govenorate).&#13;
8.     The SFD Regional Offices also monitor implementation and key sub-project implementation parameters&#13;
are recorded at SFD Headquarters by the Planning and Statistics Department. The PWP Department has developed&#13;
monitoring and evaluation indicators which recently have become operational. Substantial implementation of such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
monitoring and assessment systems would take more time and would be better tested with the new projects.&#13;
Sponsoring and Intermediary Agencies will play a key role in self-generating such data at sub-project design and&#13;
during implementation.&#13;
Recommendations for PWP Component during Phase 11&#13;
9.     PWP would continue to give priority to low-income rural communities (80-90 percent) and some urban&#13;
slums with an emphasis on communities in Upper Egypt (60 percent of reserves). Subprojects will be designed to&#13;
integrate infrastructure with community development activities.  Targeting of beneficiaries follow the same&#13;
approach already adopted in the first phase of SFD. Needs assessment studies will be carried out to screen and&#13;
improve the design of subprojects. Sponsoring and Intermediary Agencies will play an active role in the design of&#13;
infrastructure, identification and design of monitoring parameters, and identification and evaluation of impact&#13;
assessment indicators.  Such monitoring and impact assessment data will be given to SFD for review and&#13;
processing. The findings of monitoring and impact assessment indicators will be used to evaluate project objectives&#13;
and introduce design changes.&#13;
10.    Efforts will be made to ensure more participation of LDAs, Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) and&#13;
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), to ensure sustainability of sub-projects.&#13;
11.    The information provided below provides an estimate of fund allocation by sector for Phase 11 (SFD funds&#13;
would cover half of the requirements listed below, in which case allocation of funds would be pro-rated&#13;
accordingly):&#13;
(a)    environmental infrastructure LE 306 million (US$90 million) or about 43 percent;&#13;
(b)    potable water systems LE 170 million (US$50 million) or about 24 percent;&#13;
(c)    rural roads LE 119 million (US$35 million) or about 17 percent;&#13;
(d)    building rehabilitation LE 51 million (US$15 million) or about 7 percent;&#13;
(e)    O&amp;M fund of LE 34 million (US$10 million) or about 5 percent; and&#13;
(f)    project management &amp; supervision LE 27 million (US$8 million) or about 4 percent.&#13;
12.    Sewerage and sewage treatment systems, would focus on the provision of environmentally sound on-site&#13;
disposal of waste waters and domestic refuse. PWP staff will draw on the pilot biomass sub-project under design by&#13;
the Community Development Program which would be used in rural areas. This system consists of on-site&#13;
treatment of on-farm sewage, manure and organic food waste for biogas and sludge compost production for on-farm&#13;
use as fuel and fertilizer, respectively. The use of piped sewerage systems would be reserved for the exceptional&#13;
cases where ground water is shallow that precludes the use of on-site systems.&#13;
13.    Evaluation reports would be undertaken to assess the social and economic benefits, cost-effectiveness,&#13;
quality of supervision, technical aspects of design and quality of works, and adequate provisions for operation and&#13;
maintenance for sustainability. Future reports would review the technical aspects to a greater extent in order to&#13;
ensure conformity and suitability (i.e. verify materials quality and construction quality of roads, the design of&#13;
pavement and base for the traffic load, and drainage channels to protect the road embankment from erosion.&#13;
Furthermore, they would review the geometric design such as compatibility of slopes and curves with speed design,&#13;
and whether roads signs are adequate and strategically located to warn and inform the travelers).&#13;
14.    The SFD will explore the legal framework which would enable establishing O&amp;M units at the village level&#13;
to assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of public services provided by the SFD. Legally, only&#13;
voluntary contributions could be raised by an NGO but no taxes or tariff as cost-recovery mechanism could be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
raised as such charges can only be made by an Authority (under the authority law) or the Ministry of Finance (under&#13;
the tax law). The SFD will explore practical alternatives such as amending the law or just simply working under the&#13;
law for NGOs. The SFD has agreed to include three essential components within the framework agreement,&#13;
namely: (i) establishing an O&amp;M unit at the village level, such as the LDAs or an NGO, and providing training on&#13;
management of O&amp;M and fund raising and management; (ii) developing a service contribution or charge to&#13;
generate revenues for operation and maintenance to be collected and managed by LDAs or NGOs; and (iii)&#13;
providing seed funds under the SFD funded project (about 5 percent of project cost) to establish a fund for operation&#13;
and maintenance of the works. The actual maintenance may be contracted out and paid by responsible LDAs or&#13;
NGOs with funds from the O&amp;M fund. The SFD would supervise compliance with the agreement periodically&#13;
(such as every six months or annually) to ensure that such arrangements are sustainable. The fundamental principle&#13;
of this approach would be to make beneficiaries aware of their responsibility to ensure sustainability of&#13;
infrastructure through contributions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
Background&#13;
1.     The Community Development Program  (CDP), an integral part of SFD was designed to finance&#13;
improvements in: (i) productive activities focusing on income and employment generation; and (ii) social&#13;
development activities to improve the delivery of essential services to poor communities. These objectives have&#13;
been achieved to a large extent, with CDP evolving to respond to community needs, in some instances by utilizing&#13;
innovative approaches. Through its integrated project activities, CDP has infused communities with an enhanced&#13;
level of social awareness and self-esteem, especially women. CDP represents an important vehicle for mobilizing&#13;
the energies and resources of community groups, local governments, NGOs, and the private sector by using a&#13;
participatory approach, thus leading to more sustainable projects. Stimulating community involvement and active&#13;
NGO participation in Egypt can be regarded as a dramatic transformation and departure from the reliance of&#13;
communities on the public sector for the provision of services. The promotion of self-help activities can be seen as&#13;
the cornerstone of CDP projects and an effective mechanism for addressing poverty alleviation.&#13;
2.     CDP's flexibility and decentralized approach allows it to exploit the diverse strengths of different actors, to&#13;
benefit from the geographical coverage that multiple organizations might be able to provide, and to finance projects&#13;
simultaneously in multiple sectors.&#13;
3.     This report draws upon field visits, interviews, data, and various documents collected in the field.&#13;
A. Outputs of CDP Operations&#13;
4.     Community Participation. The active involvement of community groups is evident in CDP projects,&#13;
where they are involved in project selection and design. Once communities have developed a sense of ownership of&#13;
a project, they have proven to be more willing to share in its financing and to ensure that it is well maintained and&#13;
properly operated. This statement has been clearly represented in a myriad of CDP projects in the governorate of&#13;
Qena, especially in the Toad project where the community was willing to mobilize resources to implement projects&#13;
as well as provide contributions aimed at assisting marginalized families attain basic services.&#13;
5.     Provision of Basic Social Services. CDP projects have been able to distribute resources to communities&#13;
previously underserved by government agencies or private-sector organizations. CDP activities focus on the&#13;
provision of health, education and training services to poor population groups. Health activities represent 21&#13;
percent of CDP's overall project portfolio. Activities eligible for funding by CDP are: (i) provision of supplies,&#13;
equipment and personnel for primary health care centers; (ii) immunization campaigns; (iii) mother and child&#13;
nutrition programs; and (iv) provision of supplies and equipment for child care centers. Funds were allocated to&#13;
rehabilitate and equip 46 clinics, conduct 569 health awareness campaigns and train 820 health personnel.&#13;
Beneficiaries interviewed in upper Egypt and Alexandria, confirmed the need for the provision of such services and&#13;
the unavailability of alternatives.&#13;
6.     Education and training comprised 42 percent of CDP activities. Activities eligible for funding include: (i)&#13;
short-term literacy programs; (ii) practical training programs; and (iii) community organization and leadership&#13;
training. Due to its success in responding to unmet demand, 35 percent of the education budget has gone towards&#13;
financing adult illiteracy projects. The Education and Training component has helped rehabilitate 187 classrooms,&#13;
establish 9,123 illiteracy classes, and train 9,241 individuals to teach illiteracy classes. In the area of vocational&#13;
training and related training, 28 training workshops have been equipped, and 8,369 individuals have benefited from&#13;
such activities. Communities expressed satisfaction with the education and training services provided through CDP&#13;
projects, and requested a continuation of such services.&#13;
7.     The pilot survey undertaken in Beni Suef and Minya indicate that access to education has improved&#13;
through the provision of the adult education programs. These courses are attended by various members of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;

family, from all age groups. Discussions with beneficiaries highlighted their desire to enhance their income levels&#13;
and overall standard of living, a goal not deemed attainable prior to the introduction of the projects. The education&#13;
classes have afforded women the opportunity to learn basic skills such as mathematics, which in turn enabled them&#13;
to start small micro-enterprise businesses and supplement family income. Discussions with communities in upper&#13;
Egypt have indicated that vocational training has also played an important role in developing skills of young people&#13;
and afforded them employment opportunities.&#13;
8.      Employment Generation. Creating employment rapidly has been a primary objective of CDP projects.&#13;
The bulk of employment opportunities for low-income and unskilled labor have emerged as a result of labor-&#13;
intensive infrastructure projects. Infornation on the extent and cost of employment creation indicates that the 109&#13;
projects undertaken by CDP have generated 70,620 permanent jobs, and 18,152 temporary jobs both directly and&#13;
indirectly, at a cost of LE 147.5 million.' These figures reflect a close match between the expected outputs&#13;
(76,053 permanent and 35,000 temporary).&#13;
9.      The extension of credit, construction of schools, latrines or health centers stimulated demand for local&#13;
industry and absorbed a portion of the labor force in the selected communities. CDP encourages the use of labor-&#13;
intensive techniques in their projects, as well as the utilization of local resources. Communities visited in upper&#13;
Egypt emphasized the importance of employment generation activities that have materialized as a result of CDP&#13;
funded projects.&#13;
10.    Productive family activities have financed new and existing income generating schemes, involving the&#13;
establishment of small revolving funds for self-help productive activities and related training in management and&#13;
productive skills. To date, 29 percent of CDP funds have been allocated to the provision of credit programs given&#13;
to 27,657 direct beneficiaries- who would normally not have had access to funds or appropriate training required for&#13;
managing a business. Preliminary data from a pilot survey conducted in Beni Suef and Minya indicate that these&#13;
loans resulted in job creation and provided families with enhanced supplemental incomes.&#13;
11.    Credits have been used for working capital and equipment purchases, and range from LE 500 to LE 5,000.&#13;
With the average loan size averaging LE 1,000. At the inception of the project, interest on credits for productive&#13;
activities were 10 percent. Following discussions between the World Bank and SFD staff, a consensus was reached&#13;
on lowering the interest rate to 7 percent for the beneficiary. Repayment schedules vary depending on the size and&#13;
use of the credit, with two years being the typical repayment period. Collateral requirements require personal or&#13;
groups guarantees. Beneficiaries surveyed in the pilot projects in Beni Suef and Minya have expressed satisfaction&#13;
with the level of assistance established through this mechanism. Beneficiaries in Alexandria and upper Egypt and&#13;
have indicated a willingness to apply for future loans.&#13;
12.    Sharing of Information and Experiences. CDP projects have created avenues for cooperation between&#13;
various stakeholders.&#13;
(a)     Line Ministries. Projects proposed by line ministries are designed and prepared in conjunction with CDP&#13;
staff. This allows for a collaborative process and sharing of experiences. Furthermore, staff from the&#13;
public sector can learn and internalize CDP's partnership role with NGOs and local community groups,&#13;
thus leading to the adoption of a more participatory approach in project design and implementation. In&#13;
other instances, staff hired to work on CDP projects have been recruited to work in Ministries upon&#13;
completion of their assignments. It is envisaged that data collected by CDP can be utilized by the public&#13;
sector to allow for improved coordination, design and implementation of future projects.&#13;
(b)    NGOs. In order to respond to increasing demands, CDP has encouraged the formation of voluntary&#13;
clusterings. This approach aims at forging partnerships among large and small NGOs while expanding&#13;
These figures are provided by the CDP office in Cairo.&#13;
Loan applicants in many cases are members of large households. In many instances, the majority of family&#13;
members participate in productive activities, and thus the project has a positive multiplier effect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;

project reach and facilitating greater awareness of diverse views of stakeholders. The Red Crescent, Coptic&#13;
Evangelical Organization for Social Services, and CARITAS are some of the larger NGOs successfully&#13;
participating in this approach.&#13;
(c)    Communities. Meetings and visits among various community members aimed at sharing experiences and&#13;
establishing temporary twinning arrangements have resulted following the successful completion of CDP&#13;
activities in selected areas. This was evident in upper Egypt.&#13;
13.    Packaging of Projects. The design and implementation of standardized projects have facilitated quick and&#13;
efficient project implementation and has proven to be extremely effective in reaching the maximum number of&#13;
beneficiaries. This is particularly relevant in the adult literacy eradication projects which have been received&#13;
enthusiastically by 80 percent of the 26 govemorates. In fact, upon completion of Phase I of the program, requests&#13;
for additional programs have flooded the CDP office. These programs are well designed, and respond to community&#13;
needs in a manner that currently is not provided by the public sector. This is an instance where the Ministry of&#13;
Education can attempt to draw lessons in designing small and technically simple projects. Other packages to be&#13;
implemented by CDP include, upgrading PHC through the use of extension officers, development of health&#13;
emergency services, dental hygiene, and family programs.&#13;
14.    Stemming Rural-Urban Migration. The introduction of integrated projects within a community has a&#13;
positive impact in stemming rural-urban migration. Young people interviewed during the mission, expressed a&#13;
desire to remain in their respective communities given the availability of social services and employment&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
15.    Positive Externalities through Linkages of Projects (Integrated Projects). Combining a number of&#13;
components within a CDP project such adult illiteracy eradication projects with micro-enterprise activities has&#13;
resulted in increasing the level of awareness and understanding of communities, and afforded beneficiaries,&#13;
especially women, the opportunity to utilize basic reading and writing skills in managing their own business. An&#13;
improvement in the status of women also reveals their desire to have fewer children.&#13;
16.    NGOs. NGOs play a significant role in the operations of CDP activities (75 percent of the projects are&#13;
implemented by NGOs), the active participation of both national and international NGOs, as well as religious&#13;
organizations, in programs and projects sponsored and financed by the Govemment and external assistance agencies&#13;
is unprecedented. The CDP has developed a positive working relationship with several NGOs by overcoming their&#13;
initial lack of trust and skepticism, which was based in part on many NGOs' ideological opposition to the&#13;
Government's economic adjustment program. This was achieved by establishing transparent and efficient operating&#13;
methods, engaging in active, and continuous dialogue with the NGOs.&#13;
17.    Given the NGOs close association with community groups, involving them in the planning, preparation,&#13;
implementation and operation of projects has been essential to the success in implementation of CDP projects.&#13;
NGOs have also participated actively in project supervision, particularly in areas where the latter have been&#13;
involved for extensive periods.&#13;
18.    Due to the limited capacity of smaller NGOs, the CDP program has provided technical assistance. In&#13;
selected governorates in the Saiid, training NGOs in proposal preparation ranges from 3-5 months. The use of&#13;
"clustering NGOs" has been recently applied in order to meet the increasing demand being generated by&#13;
communities This method entails involving a primary NGO, with a cluster of satellite or smaller NGOs. The&#13;
philosophy behind this approach reflects CDPs emphasis on capacity building. Training is provided to the primary&#13;
NGO, as well as the smaller NGOs. Following completion of training, the primary NGO assumes responsibility of&#13;
monitoring and supervising the activities of the satellite NGOs. In this manner, accountability is maintained within&#13;
the context of NGOs, and dispersed projects are addressed through the outreach of satellite NGOs.&#13;
19.    Local Government Involvement.  CDP projects have laid the groundwork for decentralizing the&#13;
responsibility for small-scale infrastructure investment to local governments. This has been achieved by involving&#13;
local governments in prioritizing, preparing and supervising the execution of projects with inputs from their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
respective communities. As sponsors of projects, they have participated in contract management and assumed&#13;
responsibility for maintenance and operating costs of CDP projects. Some of the following factors have contributed&#13;
to the success in financing a relatively large program implemented primarily by the local government. First, most&#13;
projects financed have been small and technically simple. They were relatively easy to prepare and could be rapidly&#13;
appraised, contracted and executed. Second, CDP provided blueprints to the sponsoring local governments to&#13;
facilitate construction and ensure that projects met appropriate quality standards.  This is evident in health&#13;
awareness campaigns and adult illiteracy eradication projects. Third, CDP staff supervised project execution jointly&#13;
with representatives of the sponsoring local governments. Fourth, CDP through it's regional offices kept its lines of&#13;
communication with local government representatives open and provided them with information on the status of&#13;
CDP financed projects on a regular basis. Finally, while willing to provide technical assistance and advice,&#13;
especially to the poorest governorates, CDP has discouraged elaborate development planning exercises.&#13;
20.    By involving community groups in project selection and implementation, CDP has built local capacity for&#13;
municipal self-help efforts. Neighborhood funds groups for local improvement have been created to finance small&#13;
projects, such as drainage, health awareness campaigns, and the provision of some social services. Through its&#13;
innovative and flexible mechanisms, CDP stimulated the formation of partnerships between local authorities and&#13;
beneficiaries in the selection, implementation, and maintenance of these projects. This could lay the groundwork for&#13;
generating cost sharing and partial or full recovery on the part of the beneficiaries.&#13;
21.    The CDP could create the basis for local governments to assume more difficult functions, such as&#13;
stimulating local economic development and creating a broader local tax base. Given the high concentration of&#13;
poor communities in urban areas, the importance of strengthening local governments' capacities and increasing the&#13;
involvement of community groups in efforts to improve the infrastructure and delivery of social services and&#13;
encourage self-help efforts is critical.&#13;
22.    Sustainability and Cost Recovery. Soliciting agencies are requested to incorporate mechanisms to be&#13;
used for cost recovery, operations and maintenance in project proposals. The CDP evaluates the institutional&#13;
capacity of the soliciting agency and feasibility of the proposed mechanism to ensure proper operation and&#13;
maintenance. Operations and maintenance costs are allocated within each line ministries budget, therefore, projects&#13;
implemented by the public sector would be ensured a budget for such activities.  Projects involving direct&#13;
community implementation institute mechanisms to recover sufficient funds through modest fees and contribution&#13;
in kind to cover costs of operations and maintenance. CDP projects also include technical assistance for operations&#13;
and maintenance. This approach is successfully being implemented in certain villages in upper Egypt. Certain&#13;
projects such as adult illiteracy eradication do not require financial assistance beyond the life of the project. In most&#13;
other cases, it is imperative for CDP to monitor project sustainability beyond project implementation stage.&#13;
23.    Women's Participation. CDP activities have targeted and responded to needs which reflect the integral&#13;
role of women in poverty alleviation efforts in Egypt. As productive agents, women's participation in income&#13;
generating activities represent a crucial part of the survival strategy of poor households. Women have increasingly&#13;
shifted away from traditional agricultural into commercial activities, either in the selling of agricultural products or&#13;
in trading of urban goods and services. The status of women and their empowerment in their communities has been&#13;
dramatically enhanced through the use of a participatory approach and the provision of social and productive&#13;
services. CDP activities involve women representatives on the board of local committees. To raise the productivity&#13;
of women's activities, CDP has expanded access to basic education and training, credit and improved infrastructure&#13;
such as markets and roads. To date 50 percent of CDP projects have financed projects of these types to low-income&#13;
women.&#13;
24.    Apart from their increasingly important role in the economic well-being of poor families, women have&#13;
traditionally played the central role in the development of Egypt's human resource base. CDP's investments in&#13;
health and nutrition have addressed the precarious health conditions of Egyptian women and children, aimed at&#13;
complementing the Ministry of Health's efforts in reducing maternal and infant mortality. In addition, the provision&#13;
of safe drinking water and sanitation facilities has also improved the health status of women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
25.    Private Sector Involvement. Private contractors have carried out a large number of projects financed by&#13;
CDP. The significant involvement of NGOs in CDP operations is one way of involving the private sector. Staff&#13;
involved in CDP operations have been recruited from the private sector, a key element in the success of CDP&#13;
activities. In addition, private sector consultants have also been recruited to supervise project execution, secure&#13;
pertinent information in a cost effective manner, and audit CDP/SFD operations.&#13;
26.    Expeditious Project Processing and Flexibility. Given the flexibility inherent in SFD activities, project&#13;
processing and implementation time span have been very reasonable, especially in comparison to the delivery of&#13;
services through the public sector. The CDP interventions have helped promote incremental decentralization by&#13;
strengthening the role of regional representatives as project sponsors and has been instrumental in forging&#13;
partnerships with various members of society who traditionally have undertaken activities in isolation.&#13;
27.    Administrative Efficiency and Operating Costs of the CDP. Overall administrative costs of SFD&#13;
activities are 10 percent, comparable to most social investment funds which average 8 to 13 percent of their annual&#13;
commitments, upon achieving full output. CDP consumes I percent of administrative costs. At its peak, CDP has&#13;
approved 109 projects since its inception, worth about LE 226 million (LE 147.5 million have been disbursed).&#13;
This scale of operation has been achieved using a staff of 12 (CDP Cairo office). The speed, flexibility and&#13;
effectiveness with which CDP promoted and approved a large number of projects has helped it in rapidly&#13;
establishing its credibility.&#13;
B.     Next Steps - Challenges Facing CDP&#13;
28.    CDP should continue implementing its mandate and focusing on community and NGO participation with a&#13;
continued emphasis on capacity building and targeting of women, the poor, and unemployed. Increased donor&#13;
coordination during a second phase could serve to facilitate project implementation. The following points should be&#13;
addressed during Phase II of the Social Fund for Development Project in order to enhance its operations.&#13;
29.    Project Packaging. The adoption of project packaging and/or blueprint approach should be encouraged in&#13;
relevant projects (i.e. education and health), as should the integrated project approach. Information on successful&#13;
packaging approaches should be disseminated to the relevant ministries.&#13;
30.    Sharing of Experiences. Success stories should be documented and circulated among regional, satellite&#13;
offices, government agencies, NGOs and community groups in order to allow for replication of these activities&#13;
when relevant. This would allow for the development and transfer of effective methods for planning and project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
31.    Project Sustainability and Operations. The issue of project sustainability should be closely monitored&#13;
following the completion of project implementation. Mechanisms should be developed to respond to projects that&#13;
are meeting sustainability challenges. The CDP will start, initially on an experimental basis, a system of assuring&#13;
long-term sustainability of projects through setting up users groups to raise contributions towards long-term&#13;
operations. The SFD would start by providing matching grants to these users groups on a downward sliding basis,&#13;
eventually phasing the grants out. The success of this approach, which seems to be only one feasible, is not assured&#13;
because the CDP works in the poorest areas and the beneficiaries have little cash to offer - though they may be able&#13;
to make contributions in labor.&#13;
32.    Market Orientation for CDP Microenterprise Programs:  There have been cases where CDP&#13;
microenterprise programs have supported sub-projects which make little business sense, e.g. loans for handicrafts&#13;
for which the market is already saturated or training in skills for which there is little demand. This has led to default&#13;
in some microenterprise loan repayments and the situation needs to be corrected. It is recommended that during&#13;
Phase II, attention be given to marketability as is already done in the case of the EDP. This is already happening in&#13;
the case of the more experienced NGOs and should be generalized broadly.&#13;
33.    Supervision and Monitoring. The CDP has paid limited attention to supervision and monitoring. This&#13;
shortcoming can be attributed to the emphasis being placed on quick disbursements and the allocation of staff for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
this purpose. This issue is currently being addressed, and monitoring indicators are being included in the appraisal&#13;
and evaluation forms. With the existence of 10 regional and 6 satellite offices monitoring and supervision will&#13;
become a primary focus during Phase 11 of the SFD. Other aspects that require strengthening are impact evaluation&#13;
and beneficiary assessments. In addition, market studies as well as an evaluation of the fund's operations should be&#13;
undertaken to identify strengths and weaknesses of CDP and the conditions that facilitate or hinder performance.&#13;
34.    Targeting. Funding of community development activities has been targeted based on the original poverty&#13;
map developed by SFD in 1992. Efforts are underway for SFD to update its poverty map and targeting mechanism&#13;
in order to reflect the evolving nature of SFD, and the current patterns of poverty in Egypt. The poverty map should&#13;
be made available during the early stages of Phase 11.&#13;
35.    Decentralization. The SFD is reviewing its decentralization efforts and a delineation of responsibilities&#13;
between the main office and the field offices is currently being finalized. A more decentralized approach in the area&#13;
of project approval will allow for further flexibility in CDP operations given the increasing demand being generated&#13;
from communities.&#13;
36.    Resistance from Ministries to Work with NGOs. This has lead to temporary delays. In response,&#13;
innovative approaches are being developed to create modalities for collaboration between the public sector and&#13;
NGOs. These approaches should be documented and success cases should be circulated to stakeholders.&#13;
38.    Lack of Capacity in NGOs. Innovative training mechanisms are being developed to provide quicker&#13;
capacity building (i.e., creating apprentice programs, instituting a junior manager within an NGO with requisite&#13;
skills for capacity building), as are information-sharing and networking activities between larger and smaller NGOs.&#13;
These efforts should be evaluated in light of their sustainability and effectiveness.&#13;
39.    Limited Participation in Urban Areas. An emphasis on promoting a participatory approach in urban&#13;
areas needs to be encouraged. A review of success cases using participatory approaches in rural areas could provide&#13;
relevant examples.&#13;
40.    Coordinating Projects between different Departments in SFD. Coordinated efforts to synchronize&#13;
activities between various departments undertaking multi-sectoral projects needs to be streamlined.&#13;
41.    Limit Off-Budget Financing to Public Sector Agencies. CDP activities should provide temporary relief&#13;
to public agencies by financing priority projects while public agencies undergo structural reform. Off-budget&#13;
financing for ministries or public agencies should be gradually reduced, by placing a cap on the amount of funds&#13;
available to public agencies. This approach should be implemented in order to reduce public reliance on the social&#13;
fund for off-budget financing.&#13;
42.    Operating Manual. A revision of the Operating Manual should be undertaken to reflect lessons learned&#13;
and allow for future streamlining of activities between the CDP main office, regional and satellite offices.&#13;
43.    Conflicting Donor Interests.  Lack of synergy between donor objectives has resulted in sending&#13;
conflicting signals. There is a need for donors to streamline their objectives and their disbursement schedules in&#13;
order to allow for smoother operations .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3: ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROGRPM&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I.     The following Annex provides an overview of issues pertaining to the sustainability of the Enterprise&#13;
Development Program (EDP) of SFD. First, the current status and performance of the EDP is described followed&#13;
by a discussion of how sustainability and cost coverage could be achieved over time. This discussion includes an&#13;
overview of the basic premises underlying sustainability which were adopted by SFD during appraisal and which&#13;
need also be adopted by the Government of Egypt and donors. Finally, the steps to taken towards long term&#13;
sustainability of EDP are discussed. These include the establishment of a task force to work on a feasibility study&#13;
and business plan for EDP sustainability to be presented at the Donor Meeting in April 1996, and a redesign of&#13;
current features of the program that worked in the past but that will inhibit sustainability in the future.&#13;
Enterprise Development Program: Current Status&#13;
2.      The Enterprise Development Program is one of the core programs of the Social Fund for Development.&#13;
The objective of EDP is to create jobs for unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups through the&#13;
development and support of new and existing businesses. The EDP provides entrepreneurs with credit (mainly&#13;
through banks) and business services such as training, business counseling, support with business plan preparation&#13;
and marketing support. In addition, it is engaged in the development of new innovative sectoral programs such as&#13;
silk-production and fish-farms. Under EDP 120,000 permanent and 40,000 temporary jobs were created.&#13;
3.      Up to December 1995, the EDP credit department has lent over LE 500 million to 5 public sector banks&#13;
that on-lend to new and existing businesses. All loans were for low-income beneficiaries. Sub-loan repaymenit is&#13;
satisfactory and the banks started repaying the SFD (see table I for an overview of the performance of EDP's main&#13;
financial intermediaries). The banks recently signed on for another LE 250 million. In effect, the EDP credit&#13;
department has acted as a wholesale bank (APEX) that delivers credit to small businesses through retail banks.&#13;
4.      The success of EDP's credit program could not have been possible without the department for business&#13;
services that provided thousands of new and existing businesses with support. These services are delivered eith.r&#13;
directly by EDP or through selected NGOs receiving grants to deliver service packages. The staff of the EDP works&#13;
intensively with these NGOs to help them develop their institutional capacity to work with small businesses.&#13;
Entrepreneurs who use EDP services increase their chances of obtaining a bank loan and learn to better manage&#13;
their businesses. In effect, the EDP business services department has acted as a wholesale organization that delivers&#13;
valuable services to entrepreneurs through retail NGOs/PVOs.&#13;
The Opportunity&#13;
5.      The EDP is in an unique position to become sustainable and to achieve operational and possibly financial&#13;
costs coverage over the next few years by gradually charging fees for its services. The dynamics of this process are&#13;
described in the graph below. Currently the banks and the entrepreneurs do not pay any fee though they receive a&#13;
valuable service. Banks receive "bankable business plans" and the banks' clients are actively supported by EDP&#13;
(monitoring, problem solving) also after they receive a bank loan. This service delivery is implicit and the value is&#13;
not recognized. Like any other APEX type operation, the EDP could charge banks a percentage fee on costs of&#13;
loan funds to cover its costs of delivering these implicit services. On an outstanding portfolio of LE 750 million, a I&#13;
to 2 percent fee would generate LE 7.5 to 15 million on an annual basis. Also, the EDP could charge the&#13;
entrepreneurs a low flat fee for training and other assistance and a success fee if the entrepreneur receives a loan.&#13;

6       The unique opportunity exists to transform  EDP into a specialized small business support and finance&#13;
organization comprised of two complementary functions: the first focusing on project identification and definition,&#13;
offering technical support and marketing services; and the second specialized in offering financially engineered&#13;
credit packages. This organization would act like a wholesale agency providing loans for on-lending to banks and&#13;
technical service packages through NGOs/PVOs. The organization could have its own Steering Committee under a&#13;
common Board of Directors. It would be managed as a private sector organization but any surpluses would be re-&#13;
invested in the small business development programs.  During Phase 11, the organization would operate&#13;
independently but within the SFD structure. This would entail the operation of a separate cost and revenue&#13;
accounting system for EDP. The current MIS system appears capable to accommodate this change.&#13;
7.      Capitalization for this institution could come from the following sources of funds: (i) EU counterpart funds&#13;
currently allocated to SFD; (ii) untied donor funds currently allocated to SFD; (iii) re-flows i.e., the banks'&#13;
repayments of interest and principal; and (iv) new donor funds under Phase 11. Over time, this small business&#13;
support and finance organization could mobilize resources on local, regional, and international capital markets.&#13;
8.      The organization would keep its development mandate and could use surpluses from one project to finance&#13;
another core project to achieve certain development objectives. It could also negotiate donor funds -- based on&#13;
performance contracts -- to continue delivering services that are needed from a development perspective but cannot&#13;
generate (sufficient) surpluses to cover their costs.&#13;
9.      The corporate and organizational structure would be linked to the other programs of SFD; the Community&#13;
Development Program, the Public Works Program, and the Human Resource Development Program. Common&#13;
operational functions (i.e., office administration, personnel, accounting, MIS, treasury, legal and audit, and GM-&#13;
secretariat services) could be provided as contracted services by sections or secretariats within the EDP-&#13;
Organization for CDP and other units, which handle project-type business rather than uniform daily transactions.&#13;
Thus, the cost and quality advantages of specialized skills within the EDP-unit could be shared economically by the&#13;
other program units. As all units would probably operate under a joint Board of Directors and under partly&#13;
identically staffed Steering Committees, the normal policy and strategic and controlling instruments could ensure&#13;
the close cooperation of the management of all the Program units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
10.     The transformation of EDP towards sustainability could be achieved by an evolutionary restructuring&#13;
process of the current legal and organizational structure. Any restructuring and streamlining process would be&#13;
based on a thorough feasibility study demonstrating the viable options to prepare for the following decision steps of&#13;
SFD management, for proposals to the Government of Egypt, and for negotiations with the Donors. In the following&#13;
section, some of the basic premises of sustainability that would be incorporated in the feasibility study are&#13;
discussed.&#13;
The Basic Premises of Sustainability&#13;
11.    In order to achieve sustainability of the EDP and also enhance the prospects of a sustainable SFD&#13;
operation, the following basic premises were adopted by the SFD:&#13;
*    The EDP will use its current achievements (outstanding portfolio and beneficiaries reached) as an important&#13;
basis to develop sustainability now and in the future, which will go beyond the lifetime of Phase 11.&#13;
*    Sustainability cannot be achieved overnight; a medium term time frame of two to four years is needed to&#13;
enable the organization to cover its costs.&#13;
*    To achieve its development objectives, continued donor funding is required in the following areas: (i) funding&#13;
(on a decreasing basis) for the EDP overhead during the process of transition; this funding could be based on&#13;
EDP meeting certain performance standards that are raised over time; (ii) funding to enable the organization to&#13;
fulfill its socio-economic development mandate through transparent subsidies based on performance contracts;&#13;
and (iii) funding (on a decreasing matching grant basis) to enhance the viability, efficiency and outreach of&#13;
EDP's intermediaries (banks and NGOs) because the EDP's viability depends upon that of its intermediaries.&#13;
*   The organization will have a capital basis that is sufficient to serve its projected tasks now and in the future; an&#13;
initial capitalization of no less than LE 250 million is required. Preliminary calculations indicate that the&#13;
organization could leverage this capital and could possibly channel loans to small businesses up to LE 1.0&#13;
billion in two to three years.&#13;
*    The EDP needs to ensure (legally) that it has sufficient funds for initial capitalization to make sustainability&#13;
and independence feasible and realistic within the agreed time frame. The EDP would legally own these funds&#13;
irrespective of any developments which may influence the nature of SFD and/or its constituent core programs.&#13;
-   Since the viability of EDP is dependent on that of its intermediaries (banks and NGOs), the selection of (and&#13;
investment in) intermediaries would be based on their meeting performance standards of outreach,&#13;
creditworthiness, and financial soundness.&#13;
*    The EDP will over time charge fees for its services from banks, NGOs, and beneficiaries. Since EDP clients&#13;
will only pay for these services as long as they value them, this will constitute the basic test of market demand&#13;
and will ensure that EDP will deliver those services that are needed and tailored to demand.&#13;
*   The banks will only continue "purchasing" the EDP services if small business lending is financially attractive&#13;
for them. In this context, they should be free to negotiate the price of on-lending taking into account risk,&#13;
costs of small business lending, and a reasonable margin, without passing on costs of inefficiency to the final&#13;
borrower.&#13;
*   The EDP will need more flexibility in targeting and developing terms and conditions for its services (credit&#13;
and technical) to intermediaries and to new and existing businesses.&#13;
*    The EDP financial operations should preserve the real money value of its funds and it should hence charge at&#13;
least real positive interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
*   United donor support for and incentives to EDP and SFD are needed to help it become sustainable.&#13;
Steps towards Sustainability&#13;
12.    The following next steps are recommended: (i) establish a task force to develop a strategy and business&#13;
plan on how to reach sustainability and how to manage the restructuring process; (ii) legally ensure that EDP can&#13;
maintain already allocated donor funds; (iii) redesign certain current features of EDP that worked in the past to&#13;
"open up" the small business lending market but that may inhibit future sustainability; and (iv) set up an&#13;
independent cost and revenue accounting system for EDP within SFD's MIS.&#13;
I.     Task Force&#13;
13.    The SFD has established a task force, comprising of key decision makers in the Fund and external&#13;
consultants, to develop a strategy and business plan to achieve EDP sustainability within the context of a SFD&#13;
operation. This document will constitute the basis for Phase II and donor negotiations. A first draft is expected to be&#13;
ready by mid-February 1996 and the final version by the end of March 1996. Representatives of the EU and IDA&#13;
are advising this task force. See Attachment I for draft terms of reference for the task force.&#13;
14.    This feasibility study will include projections on the achievable targets within the main Programs or&#13;
activities of SFD:&#13;
(a)    Development of EDP loan business (credit volume targets for sectors and areas, budgets for&#13;
technical assistance and institution building, overhead costs, real value capital maintenance requirements&#13;
and risk analysis, volume of funds to be mobilized from donors, Governments, savings institutions, and&#13;
domestic or foreign banks, surplus to be generated to contribute to non-income generating social activities&#13;
of SFD, etc.)&#13;
(b)    Realistic funding volume generated or contracted with donors (grants, etc.) for subsidized social&#13;
functions and activities such as CDP, etc.&#13;
(c)    According to the current mission and functions and the achieved business volume in the EDP&#13;
field, the feasibility study should evaluate realistic options for a corporate and organizational structure that&#13;
incorporates future legal and bank technology requirements.&#13;
II.    Legally ensure that EDP can maintain already allocated donor funds.&#13;
15.    As mentioned earlier, EDP funding for capitalization could come from counterpart EU funds, untied donor&#13;
funds, and fund re-flows. Currently, over LE 750 million is on-lent to banks that are just starting to repay the fund.&#13;
Formally, the SFD has a repayment obligation for these funds to the Government of Egypt which could (partially)&#13;
free SFD from its repayment obligation and permit it to use the funds for capitalization of an EDP finance&#13;
organization.&#13;
III.    Redesign current features of the EDP&#13;
16.    At the time of design and implementation of EDP, the main (donor and government) emphasis was on&#13;
disbursement in order to create jobs without regard to sustainability. Hence, EDP is not at fault for some&#13;
weaknesses that were a result of the initial design; rather the staff of the EDP should be commended for its&#13;
achievements within such a short time frame and within a complex set of (often) conflicting (donor) demands. In&#13;
the future, the following characteristics of the EDP as it is currently operating may inhibit sustainability and hence&#13;
should be addressed:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
17.    Selection of Intermediaries. Currently, public sector banks are the main intermediaries for on-lending.&#13;
Their performance varies widely and they did not intrinsically change the way they do business. This is especially&#13;
apparent in the fact that they still require high collateral and that repayments schedules do not incorporate cash flow&#13;
dynamics. Banks will be the main income generator for the independent and sustainable EDP program, and they&#13;
will only continue "buying the EDP services and funds" if small business lending represents an attractive&#13;
opportunity for them. In this context, banks should be free to determine the price of on-lending without getting a&#13;
license to pass on costs of inefficiency to the final borrower (see below). Banks may also require institutional&#13;
support to help them become better and more efficient small business lenders.&#13;
18.    For Phase 11, the following changes are recommended: (i) widening the range of intermediaries to include&#13;
private banks, leasing companies and Islamic banks; (ii) selection of banks based on performance standards (or in&#13;
case of new intermediaries based on proven top management commitment to this field and a credible business plan&#13;
to serve this target group); (iii) provision of institutional support (on a decreasing matching grant basis) to enable&#13;
banks to become more efficient, reach volume and reduce risks.&#13;
19.    More flexibility in Targeting. It is strongly recommended that EDP reviews its targeting mechanisms.&#13;
Entrepreneurs that start or manage new and existing businesses do not necessarily have to be very poor or come&#13;
from certain disadvantaged groups such as graduates or unemployed public sector employees. The main objective&#13;
is that new businesses are created or that existing small businesses grow. Also, international experience indicates&#13;
that the unemployed do not necessarily make good entrepreneurs. More flexible target requirements will lead to&#13;
more potential entrepreneurs whose businesses will create jobs possibly employing number of disadvantaged&#13;
groups.&#13;
20.    More flexible Sub-loan design. Sub-loan terms and conditions should focus on enhancing flexibility to&#13;
better meet the entrepreneurs' needs and to ensure viability of intermediaries. Attention should be given to: (i) the&#13;
definition of micro and small businesses, taking into account sectoral differences; (ii) broadening the permitted&#13;
purposes (uses) of the sub-loans; (iii) increasing the loan ceiling (for instance up to 10 percent of the banks' SFD&#13;
portfolio) to accommodate growth of existing EDP clients and to allow for increased demand for larger loans of new&#13;
clients; loan ceilings could be changed yearly according to inflation; (iv) varying grace periods and maturities&#13;
according to the project cash flow and purpose of the loan; (v) pricing of the sub-loans according to project risks&#13;
and costs of making the sub-loan; (vi) providing incentives to banks to accept more flexible collateral; and (vii)&#13;
recognizing subsidies whenever to ensure they are transparent to banks, entrepreneurs, and donors.&#13;
IV. Set up an independent cost and revenue accounting system for EDP&#13;
21.    The current SFD MIS appears to be capable to account for EDP cost and revenues separately within the&#13;
SFD structure. Establishing an independent system will enable EDP to better understand its cost and revenue&#13;
dynamics. It will be linked to an annual (or bi-annual) budgeting process that will be used as a management tool for&#13;
strategic and operational decision making.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
Attachment 1: Terms of Reference Task Force&#13;
Develop a model to determine financial dynamics and minimum capitalization needed as well as non-financial&#13;
interventions and entrepreneurial needs and their costs. The following steps are considered essential to&#13;
determine the model:&#13;
*   Current costs and revenue flows. Analyze the current direct and indirect (overhead) costs of EDP. Make a&#13;
distinction between costs incurred for investment in intermediaries, development of services packages and&#13;
service delivery (credit and non-financial services). Identify those services that could generate revenues,&#13;
making a distinction between services that could (i) fully recover their costs of delivery, (ii) partially recover&#13;
their costs of delivery and services, and (iii) services that should be considered as non-recoverable investment&#13;
in development for which the costs incurred should be considered overhead.&#13;
*   Assessment of future development needs. Analyze the future social economic development objectives that&#13;
EDP wishes to achieve within the next five years; identify specific programs to be undertaken (or continued)&#13;
and the expected costs of doing so.&#13;
*   Assessment of banks' demand for sources of on-lending. This analysis should include the demand from&#13;
current and potential new intermediaries. It should also include a cash flow analysis of funds re-flowing that&#13;
can be re-lent and new funds needed for on-lending. The absorption capacity of the intermediaries should also&#13;
be taken into account. Determine the costs of EDP's delivery of these financial services and fees that can be&#13;
charged for the delivery.&#13;
*   Assessment of entrepreneurs demand for non-financial services. Analyze the entrepreneurs' demand for&#13;
non-financial services, assess costs of the delivery of these services and determine a possible fee structure.&#13;
*   Assessment of institutional development needs of NGOs and banks. Assess the needs for institutional&#13;
development of EDP's intermediaries to enable them to increase efficiency and outreach. Assess cost of these&#13;
needs.&#13;
Development of the model based on scenarios. Use the information obtained above as input for a financial model&#13;
to determine optimal capitalization needed and financial dynamics for a period of five years. The model should&#13;
incorporate varying assumptions on: (i) fees that can be charged over time; (ii) risks of non-repayment by financial&#13;
intermediaries of funds for on-lending; (iii) demand for financial and non-financial services; and (iv) inflation. The&#13;
model should also show increased cost coverage and sustainability over time and should identify the financing gaps&#13;
for each year. The financing gap should make a distinction in financing needed for overhead coverage, investment&#13;
in intermediaries, investment in service development and delivery of services that cannot be fully recovered.&#13;
Assess the needs for continued donor funding for next five years. Based on the outcomes of the financial model&#13;
under different scenarios, make an assessment of donor funding needed for the next five years identifying in detail&#13;
for what categories donor funding is needed (overhead, investment in intermediaries, services that cannot fully&#13;
recover their costs, certain programs to achieve social and economic development objectives). For each category&#13;
determine monitoring indicators that could be used as a basis for performance contracts with donors.&#13;
Organizational and legal structures. Determine the optimal organizational and legal structures of EDP. This&#13;
would include: (i) the optimal legal form required for the small business development and finance institution; (ii)&#13;
description of management instruments such as Board of Directors, Steering Committees, executive management,&#13;
their respective tasks and responsibilities; (iii) staffing requirements; (iv) reward and incentive systems; (v)&#13;
operational procedures; and (vi) budgeting process (as control tool).&#13;
The transition process. Prepare a phased-in transition plan. For each phase, describe in detail objectives to be&#13;
achieved, how these will be achieved and how progress will be measured and monitored.&#13;

ANNEX 4: HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
A. Background and Phase I - Labor Mobility Program&#13;
Background&#13;
I.     In recent years, the growth rate of employment in Egypt has not kept pace with labor force growth leading&#13;
to increased unemployment. A recent survey indicates that the unemployment rate was about 20.5 percent in 1993,&#13;
and more than 80 percent of those unemployed were graduates from university and technical secondary schools,&#13;
whose levels of skills were not relevant to the market needs. This skill mismatch was largely due to the poor quality&#13;
of both training and education.&#13;
2.     Egypt has a large number of public sector enterprises, and many of which continue to make losses, partially&#13;
due to over-staffing. Research shows that the level of redundant workers in public sector enterprises ranges from 30&#13;
to 40 percent. Based on the results, it has been projected that these redundant workers would be laid off as many&#13;
more public sector enterprises are expected to be privatized in coming years.&#13;
3.     In order to absorb these redundant workers and to provide job opportunities to unemployed graduates, the&#13;
expansion of the private sector is indispensable. Domestic enterprises will soon face strong competitive pressures&#13;
from the trade liberalization resulting from Egypt's accession to the World Trade Organization and its Free Trade&#13;
Treaty with the European Union.&#13;
Phase I - Labor Mobility Program&#13;
4.     The main objective of Phase I of Labor Mobility Program (LMP) was to focus on redeployment of workers&#13;
in public sector enterprises through technical assistance. The technical assistance included: (i) upgrading workers'&#13;
skills through retraining; and (ii) preparing workers for alternative jobs. In addition, the program also aimed to&#13;
provide retraining and placement of unemployed graduates.&#13;
5.     In order to facilitate labor mobility of public enterprises, LMP worked with three public sector enterprises,&#13;
and SFD provided assistance to 3,000 workers of these companies. For example, in Alexandria Shipyard, LMP&#13;
helped in retraining redundant workers. Those workers were retrained as certified welders, and their productivity&#13;
increased as much as 300 percent. The cost for retraining was LE 3,500 per worker.&#13;
6.     Currently, SFD has been authorized to work on the labor mobility programs of additional seven public&#13;
sector enterprises (total of 10 enterprises) from January 1996. The SFD will assist public sector enterprises through&#13;
programs such as retraining, early retirement, spin-offs of its business, and self-employment. The total number of&#13;
workers receiving SFD assistance by the end of 1996 is about to be 10,000 at an estimated cost of LE 110 million.&#13;
7.     To match workers to employment opportunities, LMP implemented 15 demand-led training projects&#13;
through private sector/union owned training facilities. Primarily, the training institutions identified jobs and then&#13;
requested SFD help to train workers for these jobs thus, all graduates are employed. In these activities, SFD&#13;
finances the fees for trainees and the cost of up-grading the training modules and equipment in both public and&#13;
private training centers.  These projects helped place about 2,000 unemployed graduates in permanent job&#13;
opportunities at an average cost of LE 1,500 per trainee.&#13;
B. Phase 11 - Labor Mobility Program&#13;
Phase 11 Objectives&#13;
8.     During Phase 11, LMP would be revamped into a broader Human Resources Development Program which&#13;
would assist: (a) labor mobility in public enterprise being restructured or privatized; (b) redeployment of workers in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
private enterprises which would facing new competitive pressures due to the trade liberalization; and (c) help small&#13;
and medium size (under 50 employees) private sector enterprises to improve their workers' skills. To achieve these&#13;
objectives, the program would expand the mandate of LMP to support labor mobility of private sector enterprises.&#13;
Phase 11 - Description&#13;
9.     In order to achieve the above objectives, Phase 11 of the program will have two components:&#13;
(a" Labor Mobility Component&#13;
10.    This component will assist labor mobility activities in public sector enterprises and in private enterprises&#13;
facing competitive pressures due to trade liberalization. Labor mobility would include an early retirement program&#13;
(not IDA funded), financial assistance to start new businesses, and retraining of redundant workers. A major&#13;
activity of this component would be retraining of redundant workers in public sector enterprises, so that it can help&#13;
these workers to find new jobs in private sectors. Private enterprises wishing to benefit from this program would&#13;
need to demonstrate that their competitive situation was altered by trade liberalization. This support to private sector&#13;
enterprises would start on a pilot basis and expand based on the results.&#13;
(b) Small and Medium Enterprise Skills Development Component:&#13;
11.    This component will provide financial assistance to train workers in small and medium size enterprises on&#13;
a matching subsidy basis. The main areas of training would be marketing, maintenance, quality control, and&#13;
technical skills, which are essential to expand their businesses. The matching subsidies would be transparent and&#13;
the proportion of subsidy would vary with the mobility of that particular skill. This component will not finance&#13;
stipends of trainees and salaries of trainers. In order to prioritize the area of training, the component would support&#13;
the periodical informal labor market survey (twice a year to be undertaken under contract by a private research&#13;
institutes) to assess the recent skill requirements in the regional market.&#13;
12.    The entrepreneurship skills training offered by this component are different from similar training provided&#13;
by other programs of SFD activities; i.e., Enterprise Development Program and Community Development Program.&#13;
The major difference is that the component limits finance to only skills training with high inter-firm mobility. It&#13;
would be mainly targeted to small and medium sized enterprises with 50 employees or less.&#13;
13.    A follow-up survey will be carried out for those who receive training in order to determine the cost-&#13;
effectiveness of the proposed program in terms of job creation.&#13;
C. Labor Mobility Phase II Costs&#13;
(a) Labor Mobility Component&#13;
14.    Compensation costs of early retirement program (not funded by IDA) are estimated to range from LE&#13;
2,000 to LE 7,000 per person. Financial assistance to start to new businesses would cost around LE 2,000 per&#13;
worker. The average cost for retraining redundant workers in public sector enterprises is estimated to be US$1,000&#13;
per trainee, while the cost for training workers in private sector enterprises would range from US$1,000 to&#13;
US$5,000. Target number of workers trained in this component would be 15,000 and 5,000 workers for public and&#13;
private sector employees respectively. For both public and private enterprises, the maximum training period per&#13;
worker would be six months. Estimated total program cost for this component would be US$30 million.&#13;
(b) Small and Medium Enterprise Skills Development Component&#13;
15.    The enterprise skills development training is estimated to cost US$1,000 per person. It is expected that&#13;
cost would vary according to the type of skill training. Duration of training would not exceed six months for any&#13;
type of skills training. The target number of participants for this training component would be 7,000 workers over 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
years. The program would also include a labor market survey which would cost around US$3,000 per governorate.&#13;
Thus, the estimated total program cost for this component would be US$10 million. Overall, the total cost for&#13;
Human Resources Development Program is estimated to be US$40 million.&#13;
D. Monitoring Indicators&#13;
16.    The monitoring indicators of the program would be the number of workers who received training or the&#13;
number of workers received assistance under this program. Proposed monitoring indicators for Phase 11 Human&#13;
Resources Development Program are shown in the table below:&#13;

17.    In addition to above target indicators, the impact of the proposed program would be measured by other&#13;
indicators such as the number of new jobs created by this program, number of workers acquired the required level&#13;
of skills after training, and the number of new businesses created by this prograrn.&#13;
E. Stage of Preparation&#13;
18.    This LMP part of this program is already on-going and needs to supported as an accompaniment to Egypt's&#13;
industrial restructuring process. The same approach will be applied in supporting the private sector affected by&#13;
trade liberalization with one major difference. The program will fund only training costs and not stipends. The&#13;
same rule will apply to small and medium enterprise training.&#13;
19.    The Government of France is currently providing technical assistance to SFD to help assess the quality of&#13;
Egypt's public and private training institutes. The consultants will also be looking at the proposed human resource&#13;
development program and provide guidance to SFD.&#13;
20.    The next step is to carry out informal surveys on labor mobility by skill in Egypt and use the results to&#13;
calibrate the proportion of subsidy to be given to the private sector.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 5: SFD ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE AND ECONOMIC ANALySIS FOR PHASE 11&#13;
A.      Achievements to Date&#13;
I1.     Despite a slow start due to the need to find proper staff and put in place proper procedures, SFD has made&#13;
considerable progress and has achieved significant results. Tables I and 2 show disbursements and employment&#13;
generation achieved by SFD. Note that there is a slow-down in the productive families program after 1993. This&#13;
was due to the need to assimilate properly the large number of families brought in during year 1993. More modest&#13;
and steady annual targets have been established for Phase 11.&#13;

B. Economic Rate of Return Analysis for Phase 11&#13;
3.      While the formal targeting indicators developed for Phase 11 are given in Table 3.1 in the main report, the&#13;
data in Annex 1, Table 3 show a wider range of indicators which will be used to guide operations during phase II.&#13;
These have been developed based on experience of the on-going phase. However, as SFD is a demand driven&#13;
operation these figures are subject to change. They are primarily meant to give SFD guidance. The sub-project&#13;
distribution underlying the indicators in Annex 5, Table 3 were also used as the basis for economic analysis of&#13;
Phase 11.&#13;

4.      Economic Evaluation: It is difficult to calculate an ERR for the overall project given the difficulty of&#13;
quantifying benefits of some of its activities such as upgrading public health, environment, job-training, etc.&#13;
Nevertheless, SFD attempts to quantify benefits wherever possible using willingness to pay (for community&#13;
services); estimates of travel costs savings (roads); rental values (community buildings); and enhanced prospects for&#13;
earnings (technical training and enterprise development). A minimum threshold rate of return of 12 percent is&#13;
required. These estimates should be treated with caution given that they are based on subjective assumptions.&#13;
5.      Table 4 shows the phasing of the different costs and benefits for every thousand Egyptian Pounds of&#13;
investment. The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) analysis excludes health and literacy projects as well as&#13;
institutional development projects. It also excludes microenterprises even though they are subjected to financial&#13;
sustainability tests. The ERR analysis therefore covers almost 75 percent of project funds and can be considered&#13;
good representation of the project.&#13;
6.      Based on a sample of projects financed during Phase I and extrapolating rates of return across the entire&#13;
program, the rate of return for the activities with quantifiable benefits which account for some 75 percent of project&#13;
cost, is estimated to be 21 percent. A sensitivity test was carried out by reducing benefits by 20 percent while&#13;
constant cost showed the ERR to be about 15 percent. These estimates should be treated with caution given that they&#13;
are based on subjective assumptions.&#13;

ANNEX 6: PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND CRITERIA FOR SUB-PROJECTS&#13;
A.     Project Management&#13;
1.     The SFD was established by a presidential decree issued in 1991, as an autonomous agency with legal&#13;
personality and technical, financial and administrative flexibility which reports directly to the President. The&#13;
autonomous nature of SFD is govemed in accordance with the provision of its Articles of Agreement, By-laws, and&#13;
the Framework Agreement between SFD and the government. The SFD's autonomous nature, which includes&#13;
authority to enter into contracts, establish its own operating procedures, including those for procurement and&#13;
disbursement, facilitates its ability to work with regional governments, private sector contractors, community&#13;
organizations and NGOs in an efficient and effective manner.&#13;
2.     The SFD Board of Directors (BOD) acts as a technical steering committee. It is chaired by the Prime&#13;
Minister, and is comprised of fifteen members, including eight ministers and seven representatives from the private&#13;
sector. Ministerial representation on the BOD eliminates duplication of efforts and ensures adherence to sector&#13;
priorities. The BOD is responsible for establishing SFD's guidelines for project approval and follow-up, operational&#13;
guidelines and prioritization of projects. In addition, to having policy making functions and approving SFD's&#13;
Operating Manual and annual budgets, the BOD accepts financial contributions and authorizes disbursement of&#13;
funds.&#13;
3.     To allow for efficiency and flexibility in implementation, an Executive Committee (EC) chaired by the&#13;
chairman of the BOD was created with eight members from the private sector. This is consistent with the&#13;
institutional set-up and autonomy of other successful social funds. The EC evaluates projects submitted to the SFD&#13;
prior to presentation to the BOD, and is authorized to approve projects in the amount of US$500,000 up to US$3&#13;
million. The EC has also been designated to act on behalf of the BOD and approve guidelines for manuals and sub-&#13;
projects, establish guidelines for implementation of projects approved by the BOD; delineate resource availability;&#13;
and maintain regular contact with donors.&#13;
4.     Daily operations of SFD including the hiring and management of national and regional staff (a total of 133)&#13;
are the responsibility of the Managing Director (MD), who is appointed by the Board. The MD prepares the work&#13;
programs; approves sub-projects under US$500,000; authorizes all disbursements; prepares progress reports and&#13;
presents them to the BOD.&#13;
5.     The SFD's well-defined administrative structure contributes to its efficient management of operations, as&#13;
well as its ability to absorb an increased volume of projects. It is envisaged that the current structure will be&#13;
retained for the most part, with a stronger emphasis being placed on a demand driven approach, as well as more&#13;
decentralization of authority and functions to the field and satellite offices.&#13;
6.     The national office is comprised of five departments headed by individual Director Generals reporting&#13;
directly to the MD. (Refer to Annex -- for an organizational chart , and Annex -- for a detailed description of the&#13;
roles of respective departments)  They are: (i) Finance, Administration and Personnel, (ii) Public Works; (iii)&#13;
Community Development; (iv) Enterprise Development; and (v) Human Resources.  These departments are&#13;
supported by five units which in turn report directly to the MD and serve to facilitate the overall objectives of SFD.&#13;
7.     The supporting units are: (a) Management Information Systems (MIS) responsible for maintaining the MIS;&#13;
(b) Credit responsible for determining the credit worthiness of projects involving intermediary agencies and/or&#13;
beneficiaries for both the Community Development and Enterprise Development Programs; (c) Projects and&#13;
Planning office, (includes a monitoring targeting evaluation and studies unit), with requisite skills to plan and&#13;
review SFD activities, as well as appraise and evaluate projects; (d) Legal mandated to prepare framework&#13;
agreements and handle related legal matters: (e) International Cooperation Affairs and Information for Public&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
8.      The Cairo office provides support to the regions, prepares technical plans and budgets for sub-projects,&#13;
deals with financial transactions of the sub-projects, assists with procurement, plans and coordinates training. The&#13;
SFD is represented outside of Cairo through ten regional and six satellite offices.' The regional and satellite offices&#13;
are the main point of contact between requesting agencies and SFD, they provide advice to communities, NGOs,&#13;
and regional government on SFD procedures; receiving completed application forms; coordinating sub-project&#13;
appraisal committees; and conducting field appraisals and launch workshops. The regional and satellite offices are&#13;
linked to the national offices through telephones and facsimiles. An emphasis on a more decentralized role for the&#13;
regional and satellite offices during Phase 11 will be encouraged. This will allow for improved synergy between&#13;
different programs, speed up the approval process, and help improve the impact of SFD activities on the intended&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
9.      Sub-project Cycle. The SFD initiates and accepts sub-project proposals submitted by a sponsoring agency&#13;
(SA) to any ten of the regional or six satellite offices,2. The selection of SA proposals for loans or grants3 are based&#13;
on specific guidelines established in the Operational Manual. SFD accepts sub-project proposals submitted by SAs&#13;
to the national, regional and satellite offices, based on clearly articulated guidelines established in the Operational&#13;
Manual. With assistance from trained university students (technical training is provided to the students for this&#13;
specific task) regional and satellite offices provide SAs with assistance in proposal preparation when needed.&#13;
10.     A preliminary screening is conducted by the regional and satellite offices which is then forwarded to the&#13;
national office for a detailed desk and field appraisal. As reflected in the Operational Manual, the basic elements of&#13;
sub-project appraisal are guided by: technical feasibility; social and institutional analysis; as well as simplified&#13;
economic and environmental analysis. Contributions in kind or cash will also be determinants of sub-project&#13;
eligibility, especially during Phase II.&#13;
Il.     Depending on the amount of financing requested from SFD, sub-projects can be approved either by the EC&#13;
or the MD based on precise selection criteria detailed in the Operational Manual. Upon the formal approval of a&#13;
sub-project, a framework agreement is drawn up between SFD  and each SA.  These agreements specify&#13;
responsibilities of each party: procurement methods; implementation schedules; financial terms and conditions;&#13;
and SA contribution; supervision, completion and handover mechanisms.&#13;
12.     The SFD financed sub-projects have been implemented rapidly and efficiently. Several factors explain&#13;
SFD's ability to process and approve projects rapidly. Paramount among these is the effective management style&#13;
displayed by the MD and his staff. Furthermore, SFD's status as a statutory organization outside the civil services&#13;
has helped contain political pressure. A sound administrative structure, and the clear delineation of responsibility&#13;
and accountability to staff in charge of promotion and appraisal of sub-projects is another factor contributing to&#13;
SFD's success in implementation. As does the partnership with local communities, close association with NGOs&#13;
and local Government and the use of standardized project types, which considerably simplifies project preparation&#13;
and streamlines project processing. This, combined with extensive screening, has led to an acceptance rate of 65-70&#13;
percent of the proposals submitted, a figure comparable with other social funds.&#13;
B.      Operational Manual/Sub-project Selection Criteria&#13;
13.     As is the tradition of all social funds, SFD is governed by a set of clear guidelines and operating procedures&#13;
approved by the Government and IDA.  It details SFD's organization, staffing, administration, financial&#13;
Satellite offices were established in order to provide better coordination with activities carried out in govemorates, and to&#13;
allow for closer monitoring and follow-up.&#13;
2    SAs include ministries, the public or private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities.&#13;
Grants are targeted towards infrastructure projects in rural communities as well as poor urban neighborhoods, and loans&#13;
towards income generating activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;

arrangements and operating procedures and sub-project selection criteria (discussed in length in the following&#13;
paragraphs). The fundamental rules governing the operational manual will be retained and strengthened, and other&#13;
elements will be revised to assure that the organization retains its dynamic nature.&#13;
Sub-project Eligibility Criteria&#13;
14.    Proposals funded under the Egypt Social Fund (SFD) project fall within a typology of subprojects (SPs)&#13;
encompassing public works, enterprise development, community development programs and more recently, human&#13;
resources development (this component is new and the SP selection criteria are currently being developed). These&#13;
components were designed with a view to: (i) a reduction in the levels of poverty through supporting employment&#13;
generation and community development efforts; (ii) mitigating the negative impact o the Economic Reform and&#13;
Structural Adjustment Program; and (iii) creating employment opportunities for the Gulf returnees as well as&#13;
unemployed youth.&#13;
15.    Selection and evaluation of SPs as well as Sponsoring Agencies (SAs) are guided by transparent evaluation&#13;
and selection criteria delineated in the Operating Manual of the SFD. The principal elements of SP selection&#13;
procedures emphasize: (i) general criteria; (ii) social criteria; (iii) technical feasibility; and (iv) sustainability,&#13;
including financial and institutional analysis. These selection criteria apply to all components within the SFD&#13;
program. It should be noted that for the Public Works program, Enterprise Development and Microenterprise&#13;
programs, additional criteria have been developed to reflect the specific needs of those sectors.&#13;
General Selection Criteria&#13;

geographical areas, so that project components represent community priorities&#13;
* The participation of women should be an integral component, especially in the CDP and EDP SPs, either as&#13;
targeted beneficiaries or in project management and execution&#13;
* The proposed SPs must not be included in any government action program in order to avoid duplication of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
* Banks must be willing to establish special units for the utilization of SFD funds. These units would evaluate&#13;
and monitor loans, and generate reports requested by SFD and allow for external auditing of SFD transactions&#13;
* Assessment of the bank's absorptive capacity of loan officers&#13;
* SFD credit terms with respect to the average loan size, simple collateral, interest rates should be adopted&#13;
SA 's Inmlementing Credit Programs&#13;
*  The implementing SA must be a non-profit organization or development foundation with experience in credit&#13;
delivery&#13;
*  Organizational structure should be decentralized to ensure rapid delivery of credit and management support to&#13;
the target groups&#13;
*  The implementing agency should demonstrate tan effective loan monitoring system that relies on close contact&#13;
and follow-up with loan beneficiaries through an established extension system&#13;
Selection Criteria of a Sponsoring Agency&#13;
* It should have an independent legal status and be certified to receive grants or loans and to implement activities&#13;
* Technical capacity is required for SP project preparation, supervision and monitoring. If capacity is lacking,&#13;
SFD can provide the relevant training to build up local capacity&#13;
* Past experience in implementing similar SP(s) is preferred&#13;
- Financial accounts are reviewed&#13;
SFD funds allocations should be carefully recorded&#13;
- Permission should be obtained from the respective ministry and related agencies to operate in a particular sector&#13;
- Technical personnel assigned to carry out activities in the specified sector (health, education, PW) should be&#13;
qualified and officially certified in their area of responsibility, and have at least two years of experience&#13;
C Community representation and direct links with the communities is required&#13;
- Provide assurances of operations and maintenance of SPs.&#13;
16.    Revisions of SFD's operational manual will reflect the evolving nature of the organization as well as&#13;
recommendations emerging from studies and evaluations conducted on all aspects of management and organization.&#13;
It is envisaged that revisions would highlight: (i) the fund's more decentralized role; (ii) participatory and demand-&#13;
driven approach; (iii) the merging of income generating activities as well as re-designing its current methodology;&#13;
(iv) improving synergy between different interventions; and (v) providing transparency through "two-way-&#13;
communication". These revisions were discussed during the appraisal mission and it was agreed that any revisions&#13;
to the operating manual affecting project implementation would require prior approval from IDA.&#13;
C.     Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Structure&#13;
17.    The SFD enjoys a sophisticated computer based management information system (MIS) designed to&#13;
monitor the physical and financial progress of sub-project implementation and evaluate SFD's overall performance.&#13;
As a monitoring device, it provides transparency and accountability of SFD activities, maintains data on targeting,&#13;
and facilitates contracting and payment. The MIS tracks SFD activities through the sub-project cycle, including&#13;
sub-project data, supervision, and identifies cost overruns and potential bottlenecks. MIS generated performance&#13;
reports are an integral part of the monthly report submitted by SFD management to the BOD for their review, and&#13;
the quarterly reports and annual reports submitted to donors. For the most part, SFD Phase 11 will build and extend&#13;
the monitoring system currently in place. Modifications will be aimed at enhancing monitoring and allowing for a&#13;
widespread desegregation of information. Specifically, improvements are aimed at: (a) enhancing information&#13;
dissemination on approval and disbursements at the SFD secretariat level; and (b) introducing a more participatory&#13;
approach in sub-project monitoring, by actively involving sponsoring agencies (SAs) in the process and thus&#13;
minimizing gaps in data reporting and recording requirements, which may lead to delays and discrepancies, which&#13;
undermine the usefulness of the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
18.    In order to address the first issue, the Planning and Programs Department will be responsible for collecting&#13;
information from the various operational departments (i.e., Finance, Community Development, Public Works,&#13;
Enterprise Development) and generating detailed information on approval and disbursement rates This will&#13;
facilitate and enhance SFD's tracking system and thus allow for a more transparent and accountable assessment of&#13;
financial flows required for day-to-day management decision-making.&#13;
19.    The second revision is crucial as it provides the baseline information for beneficiary and impact&#13;
assessments, and provides the bulk of the input for MIS project portfolio tracking. Currently, gaps exists in data&#13;
reporting and recording requirements, which have led to an ineffective and inaccurate application of the monitoring&#13;
system.&#13;
20.    In order to resolve this shortcoming, and to be consistent with SFD's participatory nature, SA's will receive&#13;
proper training which will enable them to become actively involved in monitoring progress on sub-projects output&#13;
delivered indicators. Information pertaining to outcome indicators and beneficiary assessments will be contracted-&#13;
out to specialized agencies possessing the necessary statistical capability, except in the cases where SFD regional&#13;
staff have the capacity to undertake beneficiary assessment. Information generated from the various indicators will&#13;
be forwarded to the Planning and Programs Department at SFD on a quarterly basis, which will allow for the&#13;
generation of a quarterly report following SFD spot checks. This approach ensures consistency with the intended&#13;
use of resource allocation and will safeguard SFD's role of poverty and unemployment reduction.&#13;
21.    In the case where SA's lack the technical or financial skills required for monitoring output delivered&#13;
indicators, SFD regional staff will provide training and/or assistance to fill the managerial and financial gaps, and&#13;
work in collaboration with SA's to fulfill their mandate.  This approach will serve as a springboard for&#13;
systematizing the delivery of training to address common constraints encountered in monitoring, and enhance&#13;
information dissemination, as well as prioritization and identification of community needs. More importantly, this&#13;
approach will assist in developing local capacity.&#13;
22.    A strengthening of ex-post evaluation, to be carried out by private firms and NGOS including beneficiary&#13;
assessment is being proposed and will provide critical information relating to inputs required to improve&#13;
intervention with the target population and determine the relationship between currently utilized methods in sub-&#13;
project cycle as well as beneficiary satisfaction. Improving client relations and enhancing communications between&#13;
SFD and its partners is actively being pursued by a separate unit "the International Cooperation Affairs and&#13;
Information for Public Relations unit". Staff from this unit will be assigned to all regional and satellite offices and&#13;
would report directly to the MD. The unit would address problems arising from poor communications and&#13;
recommend corrective actions, as well as organize information dissemination carnpaigns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEx 7: MONITORING DURING PHASE 11&#13;
1.     Egypt's Social Fund for Development (SFD) 11 builds on and extends the monitoring system already in&#13;
place under SFD 1. The enhanced monitoring system under SFD 11 will help to answer two key questions about&#13;
SFD's impact: first, what benefits is SFD providing; and second, to whom are these benefits provided.&#13;
A.     Some Concepts&#13;
2.     Impact monitoring is defined here to include three types of monitoring: (i) implementation progress&#13;
monitoring; (ii) outcome monitoring; and (iii) targeting effectiveness monitoring. These concepts are discussed&#13;
below.&#13;
* Implementation Progress Monitoring. Implementation progress monitoring tracks the extent to which the&#13;
intended goods and services (inputs and outputs) are being delivered.&#13;
* Outcome Monitoring. Outcome monitoring tracks the extent to which the development objectives which&#13;
underlie the delivery of the specific goods and services are being achieved.&#13;
* Targeting Effectiveness Monitoring. Targeting effectiveness monitoring tracks the extent to which the groups&#13;
and individuals intended to benefit are actually benefiting.&#13;
B.     Significance of Systematic Monitoring and Targeting&#13;
3.     Importance of Monitoring. The main purpose of monitoring the implementation progress and outcomes&#13;
of SFD interventions is to be able to make adjustments in design and implementation as warranted. Effective&#13;
monitoring is a useful management tool and can provide early warning signals about impending problems.&#13;
4.     There are two levels at which it is important to monitor SFD operations: (a) at the level of the SFD&#13;
headquarters; and (b) at the level of the subprojects undertaken by SFD's sponsoring agencies. Monitoring the&#13;
overall functioning of the SFD secretariat can highlight opportunities for improving its efficiency (e.g., increasing&#13;
operational speed), and informing SFD policy (e.g., the need to focus resources on Governorates with high&#13;
poverty/unemployment indices that may have received lower resources than their allocation). The importance of&#13;
monitoring the progress of subprojects undertaken by sponsoring agencies emerges from the fact that SFD differs&#13;
from traditional projects in that it does not design or implement subprojects itself, but relies, instead, on a large&#13;
number of small and widely dispersed organizations to do so; monitoring the extent to which the various activities&#13;
of these organizations are consistent with the intended use of the resources allocated to them is critical.&#13;
5.     Importance of Targeting.  Given scarce resources and the unlimited needs of the poor and the&#13;
unemployed, the chances of SFD achieving its goal of providing an effective safety net for the poor and the&#13;
unemployed would be enhanced by improving the targeting of its resources to these groups.&#13;
6.     Cost of Monitoring. Monitoring has definite costs in terms of staff time and the budget. But, these costs&#13;
should be weighed against its longer term benefits. While no precise calculations have been made here of the cost&#13;
of the proposed monitoring system, three factors indicate that these costs are not likely to place an undue burden on&#13;
the SFD headquarters. First, SFD's existing monitoring system already systematically records and regularly updates&#13;
information on SFD approvals and disbursements, the total number of beneficiaries, and the number of temporary&#13;
and permanent jobs created by each SFD component. Hence, the marginal cost of compiling the additional&#13;
information that the proposed monitoring system entails should be relatively low. Second, the responsibility for&#13;
collecting the required information on Implementation Progress will vest with the sponsoring agencies -- not SFD.&#13;
The sponsoring agencies will report this information regularly to SFD which will record the information in its&#13;
database after spot checks on its accuracy. Third, with regard to data on Outcomes and Targeting Effectiveness, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
sponsoring agencies will again be responsible for their collection, but in those cases where the sponsoring agencies&#13;
lack the capacity to collect this information and for whose collection SFD has to assume responsibility, this&#13;
information will be collected only on a sample basis -- not for all SFD subprojects or beneficiaries. Nevertheless,&#13;
the new monitoring system will entail some costs and these should be factored into SFD's costing process. It is&#13;
recommended that the cost of the new monitoring system be closely monitored as soon as it begins operation and&#13;
adjustments made in its scope as necessary.&#13;
C.      Indicative List of Performance Indicators for SFD&#13;
7.      Based on the three types of impact monitoring discussed above, indicators are divided into three categories:&#13;
* Outputs Delivered Indicators. These indicators provide an overview of the goods and services actually&#13;
delivered by the various SFD components -- they reflect implementation progress;&#13;
* Outcome Indicators. These indicators provide an indication of whether the purposes for which the various&#13;
goods and services are being delivered are being achieved -- they reflect outcomes; and&#13;
* Beneficiary Profile Indicators. These indicators help to determine whether the actual beneficiaries of SFD are&#13;
indeed the ones that it intended to benefit -- they reflect targeting effectiveness. '&#13;
D.      Data Collection and Reporting Methodology for the Identified Indicators&#13;
8.      Pyramidical Data Collection and Reporting Structure. The Projects and Planning Department of SFD&#13;
will be responsible for managing the new monitoring system. It will maintain a central database and update the&#13;
information on each of the identified performance indicators every quarter. The data collection and reporting&#13;
structure is outlined below.&#13;
9.      The Approval and Disbursement indicators as well as the Operational Speed indicators will be directly&#13;
under the charge of the Projects and Planning Department with this department calling upon information from SFD's&#13;
Finance Department and the SFD operational departments (i.e., CDP, EDP, and PWP Departments, and the Credit&#13;
Department for information on SFD loans) as needed. Many of these indicators are already systematically collected&#13;
and updated by the Projects and Planning Department.&#13;
10.     For the Outputs Delivered indicators, the Projects and Planning Department will receive systematic inputs&#13;
relating to the identified indicators every quarter from the operational departments. The operational departments&#13;
will, in turn, receive information on these indicators from the sponsoring agencies, also every quarter. The&#13;
sponsoring agencies will maintain records of the outputs they deliver to their beneficiaries and report these data to&#13;
the operational departments. Staff from the operational departments will confirm the accuracy of the Outputs&#13;
Delivered data provided by sponsoring agencies by regularly conducting checks during supervision visits to the sub-&#13;
project sites.&#13;
11.     The responsibility for collecting data on Outcome indicators and Beneficiary Profile indicators will also lie&#13;
with the sponsoring agencies who will provide this information to the relevant SFD operational department, who&#13;
will in turn, provide it to the Projects and Planning Department every quarter after spot checking its accuracy. The&#13;
sponsoring agencies should design the performance monitoring system for their subprojects from the earliest stages&#13;
of sub-project conception and regularly collect data on the selected indicators for all subprojects as soon as their&#13;
I/ Beneficiary Profile indicators can provide an indication of the Type 11 error in targeting (i.e., the extent to which unintended groups, for&#13;
example, the non-poor are benefiting from the program), but they cannot capture the Type I targeting error (i.e., the extent to which some poor&#13;
people are being missed).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
2&#13;
implementation begins. However, it is possible, that for presently ongoing subprojects, the sponsoring agencies&#13;
might find it difficult to collect the required Outcome and Beneficiary Profile data since no system was put in place&#13;
for their collection when the subprojects began implementing. There might also be some sponsoring agencies who&#13;
simply lack the necessary technical capacity to routinely collect this information and to maintain systematic records.&#13;
In either case, the Projects and Planning Department will assume responsibility for the collection of this information&#13;
-- on a sample basis -- through SFD's Regional Offices with the assistance of the concerned sponsoring agency. For&#13;
Beneficiary Profile indicators, data will be collected by administering simple questionnaires to beneficiaries, and&#13;
staff from the SFD Regional Office will record the responses of the beneficiaries. Collecting data on Outcome&#13;
indicators will be more complex and in most cases it will be cost-effective to contract-out its collection to&#13;
specialized agencies possessing the necessary statistical capability. These agencies would be able to conduct control&#13;
group analysis in selected cases to separate the effect on outcomes of factors un-related to SFD. Where appropriate,&#13;
these agencies would also be able to undertake systematic Beneficiary Assessments and qualitative studies for&#13;
specific SFD subprojects.&#13;
12.     Four-tiered Sampling Methodology.   Data on the Approval and Disbursement indicators, and the&#13;
Operational Speed indicators will be collected for all SFD subprojects. The Outputs Delivered indicators will also&#13;
be collected for all SFD subprojects. With regard to Outcome and the Beneficiary Profile indicators, these&#13;
indicators will be collected by the sponsoring agencies for all subprojects, but, in cases where the sponsoring&#13;
agencies lack the capacity to do so, the Projects and Planning Department (or specialized agencies contracted by it)&#13;
will take on this responsibility and collect these data for a saanpl of SFD subprojects. The sample will be chosen&#13;
using a four-tiered sampling methodology as below.3&#13;
? Tier I The Projects and Planning Department will select a random sample4 of 30-50 percent5 of the sponsoring&#13;
agencies (stratified by type of sponsoring agency) for each of the three components to which at least 25 percent&#13;
of the allocated resources have been disbursed.°&#13;
*   Tier 2  The Projects and Planning Department will then request each of the chosen sponsoring agencies to&#13;
provide a list of the Govemorates in which they are operating. From this list of Governorates, the Projects and&#13;
Planning Department will select randomly 20-30 percent' of the Governorates.&#13;
*   Tier 3  The Projects and Planning Department will request the sponsoring agency to provide a list of&#13;
subprojects supported in each of the selected Govemorates. From this list of subprojects, the Projects and&#13;
2&#13;
I For example, in the illiteracy prograw, the sponsoring agency could request the Beneficiary Characteristics data at the time of enrolling&#13;
the students.&#13;
3&#13;
/ It may be noted that monitoring Beneficiary Profile indicators may be less relevant in cases where SFD supervision missions to sub-&#13;
project sites confirm that the sponsoring agencies are delivering services in impoverished geographic locations, or that they are providing&#13;
services which are "basic" (e.g., adult literacy training) and which are, therefore, likely to be self-targeted to the poor. In the absence of&#13;
systematic recording and analysis of these factors during SFD supervision missions, monitoring Beneficiary Profile indicators will be useflul&#13;
even in these instances.&#13;
4&#13;
/ A standard statistical technique for choosing random samples will be used.&#13;
5&#13;
/ These percentages are indicative; an appropriate absolute number of observations should be chosen for the sample.&#13;
/ This tier of sampling is relevant in the case of the EDP component where SFD operations are listed by the sponsoring agencies, e.g.,&#13;
Banque du Caire instead of a listing of each of the subprojects financed by Banque du Caire. For components for which a list of each of the&#13;
subprojects is available, this tier would be omitted.&#13;

Planning Department will select randomly 20-30 percent' of the subprojects. The SFD Regional Office with&#13;
the assistance of the sponsoring agency will collect the Outcome indicators for this sample of subprojects and&#13;
report them to the concerned SFD operational department.&#13;
* Tier 4 For the Beneficiary Profile indicators one more stage of sampling will be required; for the identified&#13;
sample of subprojects, the Projects and Planning Department will request a list of beneficiaries from the&#13;
sponsoring agency. From this list of beneficiaries, the Projects and Planning Department will select randomly&#13;
20-30 percent of the beneficiaries9. Again, the SFD Regional Office with the assistance of the sponsoring&#13;
agency will collect Beneficiary Profile data on the selected beneficiaries and report it to the concerned SFD&#13;
operational department.&#13;
13.    Format for the Projects and Planning Department's Database. Data on Outputs Delivered, Outcomes, and&#13;
Beneficiary Profile will be compiled by the Projects and Planning Department in a format that includes: name of&#13;
sub-project; acronym of the SFD component that the sub-project falls under; the type of beneficiaries to whom the&#13;
data pertains (e.g., in a public works program whether the beneficiary data relates to those who are employed on the&#13;
public works, or to those benefiting from the use of the infrastructure); month and year during which the data was&#13;
collected; month and year when this data is being reported; name of sponsoring agency; name of Governorate in&#13;
which the sub-project is operational; rural or urban coverage of the sub-project; sub-project start date; planned&#13;
sub-project completion date; and percentage of total sub-project allocation disbursed to date. The database should&#13;
allow producing separate print-outs by Component, by Governorate, by RuralUrban, or by Sponsoring Agency.&#13;
The database should also permit the production of print-outs for SFD-wide informnation, e.g., it should allow us to&#13;
answer questions such as what percentage of SFD beneficiaries are women, or, what percentage of SFD&#13;
beneficiaries are rural.&#13;
14.    Interpretation of the Data. The data collected in the above manner for the specified indicators will not be&#13;
combined into a single index, but rather the information will be used as a matrix that provides an overview of the&#13;
different aspects of SFD's performance. Data on the different indicators in the matrix will not, by itself, enable us to&#13;
arrive at firm conclusions about project performance; such data can only point to areas that need further&#13;
examination and it should be examined in the light of the goals of the intervention and the location-specific&#13;
conditions.&#13;
15.    An evaluation of the monitoring system will be undertaken to ensure effective implementation and allow&#13;
the system to evolve and reflect the changing environment.&#13;

ANNEX 8: PARTICIPATION AND TARGETING&#13;
Participation&#13;
1.     In addition to creating employment and delivering social services through a demand driven approach, the&#13;
Egypt Social Fund for Development (SFD) has been successful in fostering a participatory approach to sub-project&#13;
design, implementation and evaluation. SFD has also created complementary relationships between the objectives&#13;
of the fund and those of line agencies and the final beneficiaries. This in turn has catalyzed beneficiary participation&#13;
in decision making and unleashed the latent energy of people, leading to a more sustainable development approach&#13;
in comparison with the more traditional project approach.  Specifically, the involvement of beneficiaries in&#13;
consultation, cost sharing and decision making has improved the outcomes of sub-projects by: (a) ensuring that sub-&#13;
projects are relevant to beneficiary needs; and (b) generating commitment to sustaining project activities.&#13;
2.      Beneficiary participation strategies are imperative to ensure the sustainability of the a large number of&#13;
dispersed sub-projects. These include: (i) transferring participatory approaches to government agencies and&#13;
intermediaries; (ii) decentralizing management; (iii) sharing information with stakeholders; (vi) training staff in&#13;
participatory approaches; and (v) training beneficiaries. Each approach is discussed in detail below.&#13;
(a)     Transferring Participatory Approaches to Government Agencies and Intermediaries. Incorporating&#13;
mechanisms to transfer the participatory elements to regular government ministries, as well as other sponsoring&#13;
agencies (i.e., NGOs) is being pursued by the fund. During Phase 11, SFD is planning a training program for&#13;
ministry staff in management information during sub-project appraisal and execution. Given the important role&#13;
delegated to NGOs/intermediaries, SFD has allocated resources for assessing and strengthening their capacities, in&#13;
terms of beneficiary representation and development effectiveness. NGOs are evaluated during appraisal of a sub-&#13;
project, on the basis of criteria which indicate where training might be required. In response to the training needs&#13;
required by NGOs, a one year pilot program is being initiated in six governorates to benefit twenty NGOs with the&#13;
goal of building their institutional capacity.&#13;
(b)     Decentralizing Management.  The existence of ten regional and six satellite' offices facilitates the&#13;
implementation of a participatory approach throughout the sub-project cycle by allowing for close community&#13;
consultation. This has fostered a collaborative decision making process and forged links between community&#13;
organizations engaged in joint development activities.&#13;
(c)     Sharing Information with Stakeholders. The SFD employs a variety of mechanisms and strategies aimed at&#13;
fostering a participatory dialogue, which include information sharing and consultative sessions and workshops with&#13;
stakeholders (governorates, NGOs, and communities) during the promotion, and appraisal stages. In addition, these&#13;
efforts are complemented by beneficiary assessment, sub-project ex-post evaluations, and participatory rural&#13;
appraisal methods designed to evaluate and constantly improve project design in order to target the intended&#13;
beneficiaries more precisely, involve them in the sub-project cycle, and define the characteristics of the least&#13;
advantaged groups.&#13;
(d)     Training Staff in Participatory Approaches.  Involving staff (NGOs, and religious leaders) who have&#13;
worked with beneficiaries, has demonstrated success in designing and implementing sub-projects. Familiarity with&#13;
the cultural milieu, ability to communicate with the poor are assets which allow the fund to operate more&#13;
effectively. Fund staff receive training in participatory intervention methods in order to enable them to become&#13;
more responsive to the needs of the beneficiaries. During Phase 11 of the SFD, efforts should be made to introduce&#13;
an incentive structure that rewards staff for adhering to participatory procedures.&#13;
(e)     Training Beneficiaries In the case where beneficiaries do not have the requisite skills to prioritize, and/or&#13;
prepare proposals and/or technical designs, SFD provides technical assistance to help beneficiary groups prepare&#13;
The number of regional and satellite offices is not expected to increase over the life of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

proposals and carry out technical design. In such instances extensive training and institutional strengthening&#13;
programs are provided to the stakeholders, with an emphasis on local planning, prioritization of needs, management,&#13;
monitoring, as well as operations and maintenance. This empowers beneficiaries to identify and prioritize their&#13;
needs to develop strategies to meet them.&#13;
Targeting&#13;
3.      Given it's mandate to mitigate the impact of economic adjustment on the poor and marginalized groups,&#13;
the SFD has fulfilled its aim at extensive coverage across the country. Priority target areas were selected based on a&#13;
targeting map prepared by SFD in 1992. The amounts of financing extended were weighed according to the relative&#13;
poverty rankings of each governorate. Data generated from the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and&#13;
Statistics (CAPMAS) has been used to occasionally supplement the original poverty map. Efforts are underway for&#13;
SFD to update it's poverty map and targeting mechanism in order to reflect the evolving nature of SFD, and the&#13;
current patterns of poverty in Egypt.&#13;
4.      Currently, SFD's geographic and sectoral resource allocations reflects both a demand and supply driven&#13;
nature.  It does not identify potential sub-projects but responds to proposals generated by beneficiaries or&#13;
intermediaries. Thus, those groups with the greatest ability to generate proposals are better positioned to benefit&#13;
from SFD funds, though typically they are not the neediest. SFD is attempting to reconcile the discrepancies&#13;
between demand and supply by streamlining targeting and promotion efforts in order to better respond to the poor.&#13;
During Phase I, SFD's activities focused on the disbursement of funds, and targeting was relegated to a secondary&#13;
role. Therefore, except for a recent pilot survey, limited data exists on SFD's targeting effectiveness. This situation&#13;
is quickly being revised, and staff at the fund are in the process of remedying this short-coming. Data on targeting&#13;
will be collected during promotional campaigns as well as desk and field appraisals using participatory approaches.&#13;
5.     Pilot Survey-Targeting. A recent pilot survey conducted in two Governorates (Minya and Beni Suef) to&#13;
assess the effectiveness of SFD's targeting mechanism was undertaken by the Project and Planning Department.&#13;
This was done to test some of the recommended Beneficiary Profile indicators in collaboration with the Community&#13;
Development Program and the Enterprise Development Program. Seven sub-projects (three in Beni-Suef and four&#13;
in Minya) out of 19 sub-projects were chosen based on the accessibility of sub-project sites. Varying numbers of&#13;
districts in which these sub-projects were operating were chosen for each sub-project. A sample of 5 percent of the&#13;
beneficiaries (100 percent of the beneficiaries, where the total number of beneficiaries was small) was chosen in&#13;
each selected district for each sub-project (amounting to a total sample of 903 beneficiaries). Beneficiary Profile&#13;
data were also collected for a sample of beneficiaries for two additional sub-projects (sample of 583 beneficiaries).&#13;
6.      The results of the CDP pilot highlighted that a large segment of beneficiaries in the literacy program in&#13;
Beni-Suef were women (54 percent); 68 percent of the beneficiaries of the Giza literacy program were illiterate and&#13;
the rest were drop-outs as opposed to 63 percent illiterate and 37 drop-outs. 42 percent of beneficiaries participating&#13;
in the Productive Families Project had assets of less than L.E.500 (US$150); and six of the 9 projects had&#13;
beneficiaries roughly of whom came from households with 7 or more members; and 20 percent of the beneficiaries&#13;
in the seven sub-project did not have access to sanitation facilities, indicating they were very poor.&#13;
7.      The methodology used for determining the beneficiaries from the Enterprise Development Program (EDP),&#13;
was taken from a total of 18 EDP sponsoring agencies that had been contracted and had received disbursements&#13;
from SFD. A sample of 8 agencies were chosen, A random sample of 10 percent of the loan recipients were&#13;
selected which amounted to 347 out of a total of 3480 loan recipients. The results indicated that in several&#13;
governorates, more than half the beneficiaries were women, and in other govemorates, most of the beneficiaries&#13;
were located in rural areas. In select cases, 33 percent of the beneficiaries had been unemployed prior to receiving&#13;
the EDP loan.&#13;
8.     The above information would require complementary data collected through BA, or a Needs and Capacity&#13;
Study. Nevertheless, in broad terms the results from the pilot indicated that specific SFD sub-projects are reaching&#13;
individuals who could be classified as "needy", suggesting that SFD's current targeting mechanism could be&#13;
achieving its intended beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
9.      Given the evolving nature of SFD, target groups will have to be redefined to guide the design of each of&#13;
SFD's components. The existing socio-economic data which focuses on the governorate level needs to be narrowed&#13;
to the district, village, or community level, thereby enabling SFD to concentrate resources on those specific&#13;
locations that have the highest poverty/unemployment rates.&#13;
10.    Priority Ranking. Assigning a three-layered targeting and ranking methodology for the selection of sub-&#13;
projects for financing by SFD is being explored. This methodology used in other social funds, assigns priority ranks&#13;
of 1, 2 etc.. to: (a) intended target groups; (b) different types of sub-projects; and (c) the Governorates. The target&#13;
group rank would be regarded as the overriding rank; if two sub-projects had the same target group rank, the rank&#13;
for the sub-project type would determine which sub-project is chosen for financing. It two sub-projects had the&#13;
same target group rank and the same sub-project type rank, the rank for the governorate would determine the choice&#13;
of the sub-project for financing. The objective of the ranking exercise is to learn how the fund is doing in meeting&#13;
community needs. In addition to the above recommendation, it is imperative for SFD to apply targeting criteria&#13;
throughout the sub-project cycle, starting with promotion through implementation and supervision. During each&#13;
stage, using participatory methods for collecting data will also allow for a diagnostic self-assessment.&#13;
