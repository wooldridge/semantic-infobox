DEVELOPMENT UPDATE&#13;
October 2015&#13;
&amp;#12;Preface&#13;
&#13;
          The Afghanistan Development Update is published twice a year, covering recent&#13;
          economic developments and the medium-term outlook for Afghanistan. A focus&#13;
          topic, with a more in-depth analysis, is included in each publication. While lack of&#13;
          high-frequency data in the country make detailed analysis somewhat difficult, efforts&#13;
          are made to use reliable sources of data as comprehensively as possible. The&#13;
          Afghanistan Development Update is intended for a wide audience, including policy&#13;
          makers, the donor community, the private sector, and the community of analysts and&#13;
          professionals engaged in Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s economy.&#13;
&#13;
          This report was prepared by Omar Joya, Claudia Nassif, Aman Farahi (all GMFDR)&#13;
          and Silvia Redaelli (Senior Economist, GPVDR). Useful inputs were received from&#13;
          Deepak K. Mishra and the wider country team. This report was prepared under the&#13;
          overall guidance of Shubham Chaudhuri (Practice Manager, GMFDR) and Robert&#13;
          Saum (Country Director). The authors also gratefully acknowledge the cooperation&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Executive summary&#13;
               More frequent incidences of violence in Afghanistan, as well as delays in the elections&#13;
               process and cabinet formation, continued to fuel uncertainty and affected investor&#13;
               confidence in 2014 and the first half of 2015. Economic growth slowed to 1.3 percent&#13;
               in 2014, down from 3.7 percent a year earlier. Unlike in previous years, agriculture did&#13;
               not contribute much to growth in 2014. Production levels were high for a third year&#13;
               in a row but did not supersede the strong output in 2013. Growth was mainly driven&#13;
               by services and a slight expansion of industries where an increase in construction&#13;
               activities outweighed lower production in manufacturing. Private investment activities&#13;
               showed strong signs of slowdown in 2014, evidenced by a drop of nearly 50 percent&#13;
               in new firm registrations since 2012.&#13;
&#13;
               Growth, projected at 1.9 percent in 2015, will likely remain sluggish in light of a&#13;
               further deterioration in security over the first three quarters in 2015. The number of&#13;
               new firm registrations in the first six months of the year, which is a proxy for investor&#13;
               confidence, remained at the same level as in the first half of 2014.&#13;
&#13;
               Fiscal developments in Afghanistan point to some headway on revenue mobilization&#13;
               in 2015. Domestic revenue increased over the first 8 months of 2015 as a result of&#13;
               improvements in the customs and tax administration. New revenue measures,&#13;
               implemented in September 2015, will likely lead to an acceleration of revenue&#13;
               collection in the remainder of the year. The most recent projections indicate that&#13;
               domestic revenues will reach Af 114.2 billion (equivalent to 9.8 percent of GDP) by&#13;
               end 2015, falling much behind the initial target of Af 120 billion.&#13;
&#13;
               However, recurrent expenditures are also projected to increase in 2015, due to&#13;
               growing security costs. Substantial, additional discretionary donor grants this yearâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
               agreed under the New Development Partnership Agreement with the United States&#13;
               and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) Incentive Programâ&#128;&#148;will&#13;
               likely help to balance the budget this year. Nevertheless, the budget may run a deficit&#13;
               if the Government fails to meet the agreed commitments that trigger fund&#13;
               disbursements under these programs. Moreover, the weak cash reserve position at the&#13;
               beginning of the year exposes the budget to larger fiscal risks.&#13;
&#13;
               With declining global food and fuel prices and weakening domestic demand, inflation&#13;
               is projected at â&#136;&#146;1.7 percent (period average) for 2015. The depreciation of the&#13;
               Afghaniâ&#128;&#148;around 8 percent vis-Ã -vis the U.S. dollar in the first eight months of the&#13;
               yearâ&#128;&#148;has partially offset deflationary pressures stemming from the decline in food&#13;
               and nonfood prices. Imports amount to around 40 percent of GDP and tend to have&#13;
               a large impact on domestic prices through imported inflation.&#13;
&#13;
               The medium-term outlook points to slow post-transition recovery. Real GDP growth&#13;
               is projected to increase to 3.1 and 3.9 percent in 2016 and 2017 respectively,&#13;
               conditioned on improvements in the security environment and strong reform&#13;
               momentum, which could help restore confidence in the economy. Nevertheless,&#13;
               much higher growth rates are required to counter population growth at 2.5 percent&#13;
               and an estimated 400,000 entrants into the labor force each year. Good performance&#13;
               of the agriculture sector and declining food prices could mitigate the upward pressure&#13;

                                                                                                     I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  Afghanistan Development Update&#13;

&#13;
               on poverty stemming from negative growth in per capita GDP in 2014 and 2015.&#13;
               However, poverty is expected to remain consistently higher than its pre-transition&#13;
               level due to the contraction in off-farm labor demand and security-related constraints&#13;
               in service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
               The National Unity Government has embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to&#13;
               revitalize the economy, tackle corruption, and improve investment climate. However,&#13;
               it will take time for these reforms to have an impact, and it is yet unclear how much&#13;
               they will mitigate the high risks stemming from the fragile security environment.&#13;
               Growing trends in security and pension and wage spending over the medium term&#13;
               require immediate attention. Afghanistan faces significant financing shortages for&#13;
               both civilian and security spending. Therefore, securing continued high levels of&#13;
               donor financing over the coming years is of critical importance for fiscal stability in&#13;
               the country. The fragile security environment and financing constraints, compounded&#13;
               by weak governance capacity, pose serious challenges to service delivery in&#13;
               Afghanistan. Any setback in reform implementation would further slow down the&#13;
               pace of human capital accumulation in Afghanistan and reduce future prospects of&#13;
               growth and poverty reduction.&#13;

&#13;
  A. Recent Economic Development&#13;
&#13;
                     1. Background&#13;
&#13;
Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s                     Afghanistan emerged successfully from a security transition that was marked by the&#13;
economic and social               withdrawal of most of international military forces under the NATO-led International&#13;
development is                    Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission. Responsibilities for security operations&#13;
overshadowed by                   were fully shifted to the Afghanistan National Security Forces. Presidential elections&#13;
tumultuous events at              were held in 2014â&#128;&#148;for the first time without an incumbent candidate since emerging&#13;
the political and                 out of conflict. However, disputes over the election outcomes and the formation of&#13;
security front.                   National Unity Government (NUG) prolonged the political transition. Since in office,&#13;
                                  the NUG has embarked on a new, ambitious reform program centered heavily around&#13;
                                  initiatives to fight pervasive corruption. The NUG has also taken a number of bold&#13;
                                  steps to reshape internal and external political organization and restore peace. These&#13;
                                  steps were impeded by a change in the leadership of the Taliban and reports of the&#13;
                                  emergence of militant activities by the ISIS.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Security continues to be a critical threat to personal safety, public service delivery, and&#13;
                                  private investments. Incidences of conflict and violence increased, resulting in nearly&#13;
                                  3,700 civilian deaths in 2014, higher than any level in recent years. Between January&#13;
                                  and June 2015 the number of civilian deaths was slightly lower than over the same&#13;
                                  period last year, but the surge of large-scale insurgent attacks over the summer combat&#13;
                                  period has led to an extraordinarily large number of additional victims.&#13;

                     2. Real Sector Activity&#13;
&#13;
Recovery from the                 Real GDP growth slowed to 1.3 percent in 2014, down from 3.7 percent a year earlier.&#13;
impact of transition              More frequent incidences of violence and growing uncertainty in the after-math of&#13;
is slower than                    the transition process continued to affect business and consumer confidence. Unlike&#13;
anticipated                       in previous years, agriculture did not contribute much to growth in 2014. Production&#13;
                                  levels were high for a third year in a row but did not supersede the strong output level&#13;
&#13;
October 2015                                                                                                  THE WORLD BANK&#13;
                                                                                                                            1&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               in 2013. Growth was mainly driven by two factors. First, there was slight growth in&#13;
                               industries (2.4 percent), where an increase in construction activities (7 percent)&#13;
                               outweighed lower production in manufacturing (â&#136;&#146;2.5 percent). Second, services grew&#13;
                               by 2.2 percent in 2014, mainly on account of government and telecommunication&#13;
                               services.&#13;

Expansion of                   Industries grew overall by 2.4 percent in 2014. However, manufacturing and mining&#13;
construction                   contracted by â&#136;&#146;2.5 percent and â&#136;&#146;2.2 percent respectively. This was offset by strong&#13;
activities offset an           growth of 7 percent in construction. These trends are likely to be a result of lower&#13;
overall decline in             domestic demand due to weaker consumer and business confidence. Manufacturing&#13;
industry growth                was particularly hard hit. Except for carpets, which are to a large extent exported, all&#13;
                               manufacturing products are marketed domestically. On the other hand, construction&#13;
                               activities are less prone to transitory shocks, because construction projects typically&#13;
                               span several years and demand for construction stems largely from the public sector.&#13;

Inflation slipped into Declining prices for global commodities, as well as weakening domestic demand, have&#13;
negative territory     lowered the prices and exerted deflationary pressures. Consumer price inflation&#13;
                       dropped to â&#136;&#146;4.8 percent in July 2015, down from 1.4 percent in December 2014. This&#13;
                       is much more moderate than the decline in global price trends in commodities. World&#13;
                       prices of grains and energy, for instance, plunged by â&#136;&#146;40 percent and â&#136;&#146;21 percent&#13;
                       respectively (on a 12-month comparison basis in April 2015). The impact of declining&#13;
                       global prices has been countered to some extent by the depreciation of the exchange&#13;
                       rate for the Afghani. Imports amount to around 40 percent of GDP and tend to have&#13;
                       a large impact on domestic prices through imported inflation.&#13;

nonfood prices                                           Prices for vegetables, which are the second largest food item, fell by â&#136;&#146;21 percent.&#13;

                                                         have also been falling. Property prices have plummeted over the past two years as a&#13;

Official exports have                   Official exports in the first half of 2015 were 15 percent lower than exports over the&#13;
dropped                                 same period in 2014 in spite of a weaker exchange rate and strong agriculture output.&#13;
                                        In fact, as exports in Afghanistan are agriculture-related products and commodities,&#13;
                                        years with strong agriculture production normally see increases in exports. Dried&#13;
                                        fruits, medicinal plants, and carpets represent the three major export items for&#13;
                                        Afghanistan. The limited effect of the exchange rate depreciation on exports implies&#13;
                                        large competitiveness challenges in production and supply chains in export sectors.&#13;

Risks to balance of                          The current trend of currency depreciation is not expected to cause external&#13;
payments in the                              imbalances in the immediate future. At the moment, the high level of imports are&#13;
immediate future are                         predominantly financed by the large foreign aid inflows. The flexible exchange rate&#13;
low                                          regime further safeguards the stability of the external accounts because it allows the&#13;

                                             one would typically expect. This has important implications for macroeconomic&#13;

B. Outlook and Medium-Term Prospects&#13;
The growth outlook             Growth, projected at 1.9 percent, will likely remain sluggish in light of the&#13;
for 2015 remains               deterioration in security over the first three quarters of 2015. Investor and consumer&#13;
sluggish                       confidence in the nonagricultural sectors show no signs of picking up over 2015. With&#13;
                               declining global food and fuel prices and weakening domestic demand, inflation is&#13;
                               projected at â&#136;&#146;1.7 percent (period average) for 2015. While currency depreciation will&#13;
                               offset to some degree the effects of declining global commodity prices, weakened&#13;
                               domestic demand will continue to exert deflationary pressure through prices of&#13;
                               nontraded, nonfood items. Fiscal vulnerabilities will continue to be high. Revenues&#13;
                               recovered somewhat in the first half of the year, but they may remain below the initial&#13;
                               target of Af 120 billion. In light of the current revenue performance, the revenue&#13;
                               target for 2015 is revised to Af 114.2 billion (equivalent to 9.8 percent of GDP).&#13;
                               Recurrent expenditures are projected to increase in 2015, due to growing security&#13;
                               costs. The budget could potentially run a deficit of US$100â&#128;&#147;US$150 million this year.&#13;
                               However, if substantial, additional discretionary donor grants materialize under the&#13;
                               New Development Partnership Agreement with the United States and under the&#13;
                               ARTF Incentive Program, the government should be able to balance the budget and&#13;
                               build up depleted cash reserves.&#13;
Post-transition      Real GDP growth is projected to increase to 3.1 and 3.9 percent in 2016 and 2017&#13;
recovery is expected respectively, conditioned on improvements in the security environment and strong&#13;

                     Nevertheless, much higher growth rates are required to counter population growth at&#13;

                     performance of the agriculture sector and declining food prices could mitigate the&#13;
                     upward pressure on poverty stemming from negative growth in per capita GDP in&#13;
                     2014 and 2015. However, poverty is expected to remain consistently higher than its&#13;
                     pre-transition level due to the contraction in off-farm labor demand and security-&#13;
                     related constraints in service delivery.&#13;

The growth outlook       Agriculture and services will likely be among the key drivers of economic growth.&#13;
is contingent upon a     Agriculture accounts for about a quarter of GDP and is also linked closely to other&#13;
relatively stable        parts of the economy, such as food and beverages (which account for almost all of&#13;
political and security   manufacturing), and parts of transport and retail. Afghanistan has the potential to&#13;
environment              build on this foundation by reviving its historical position as an important exporter&#13;
                         of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and other higher value-added products. This will require&#13;
                         investments in irrigation and extension services to improve capacity, as well as efforts&#13;
                         to build and improve downstream agro-processing activities. On the other hand, the&#13;
                         government also has the option to tap into large potential for developing extractive&#13;
                         industries, which currently account for a very small share of GDP. Unlocking this&#13;
                         potential will require progress on the legislative framework as well as securing&#13;
                         financing for the necessary infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
The medium-term          The fragile political and security environment has been a considerable constraint to&#13;
growth outlook is        private investment and growth. Continued violence, economic crime, and systemic&#13;
subject to serious       corruption also have often undermined progress in Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s governance and&#13;
risks, which will        state-building agenda. Much will depend, therefore, on Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s success in&#13;
need to be carefully     achieving peace, stability, and reconciliation. A number of factors are exposing poor&#13;
managed                  and vulnerable households to more risks. First, the sharp slowdown in growth during&#13;
                         2013â&#128;&#147;15 puts pressure on underemployment and thus consumption across the board.&#13;
                         Second, although agriculture experienced a bumper year in 2012 (growing by 18.2&#13;
                         percent, likely postdating the 2011â&#128;&#147;12 household survey), subsequent growth in the&#13;
                         sector during 2013â&#128;&#147;14 remained relatively flat, and unfavorable weather conditions&#13;
                         point toward a contraction in 2015. Poverty incidence in 2015 is thus projected at 39&#13;
                         percent. In the medium term, Afghanistan faces headwinds from declining aid and a&#13;
                         demographic youth bulge. In this context, making progress on poverty reduction will&#13;
                         require a combination of factors, including a pickup in overall growth, achieving&#13;
                         steady growth in the agriculture sector, reducing underemployment, mitigating&#13;
                         climactic shocks, and addressing regional disparities.&#13;

Restoring fiscal         Revenue reforms have picked up momentum in the second half of 2015, with the&#13;
stability will require   implementation of new tax measures and commitments to important institutional&#13;
accelerating revenue-    reforms in the customs and revenue administration. Nevertheless, the fiscal crisis in&#13;
enhancing reforms,       2014 exposed the Government to larger fiscal risks in the medium term. The weaker&#13;
additional               cash position and larger stock of arrears at the beginning of 2015 mean that there will&#13;
discretionary            be more need for adjustment moving forward. In the medium term, contingent on&#13;
assistance, and          the successful implementation of revenue-enhancing reforms, revenues are projected&#13;
prioritizing             to improve from 8.7 percent of GDP in 2014 to 11.6 percent by 2018â&#128;&#148;which is&#13;
expenditures             about the level of revenue in 2012. While the projected increase in revenues is&#13;
                         ambitious, it will still leave Afghanistan with a currently unfinanced fiscal deficit of&#13;
                         1â&#128;&#147;2 percent of GDP during 2015â&#128;&#147;18. The fiscal deficit (excluding donor grants) is&#13;
                         forecast to reach 22.2 percent of GDP by 2018. If additional resources are not&#13;
                         forthcoming to cover this gap, more aggressive expenditure consolidation efforts&#13;
                         would be needed, which would compromise development prospects and social&#13;
                         outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Raising fiscal           Recent analysis shows that with considerably greater effort to reduce leakages and&#13;
revenue will require     improve administration of the tax regime, revenues could be raised up to 16 percent&#13;
larger reform efforts    of GDP. This is grossly inadequate to finance Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s current level of spending,&#13;
and promoting new        which is at 30 percent of GDP and does not yet fully account for liabilities that are&#13;
sources of economic      currently financed off-budget, especially in the security sector. But raising revenue&#13;
growth                   above its current potential would require tapping into new sources for economic&#13;
                         growth. The natural resources sector would be a good contender, with its large&#13;
                         potential to contribute to revenues in the medium and long term. However, the&#13;
                         timeline for new developments in extractive industries has become more uncertain in&#13;
                         light of strategic reorientation in policy decisions and slow progress in reforms over&#13;
                         the past year.&#13;
&#13;
Budget expenditures      Total budget expenditures are projected to rise from 26 percent of GDP in 2014 to&#13;
are projected to rise,   30 percent in 2016. This increase is largely a result of more security spending moving&#13;
with higher security     on budget, while it was previously undertaken directly by international partners.&#13;
and social benefit       Moreover, Afghanistan has considerable public expenditure needs in the areas of&#13;
spending                 service delivery, building essential infrastructure, and operations and maintenance.&#13;
                         For example, delivering on goals to improve education outcomes will require hiring&#13;
                         increasing numbers of teachers. Developing new sources of growth will require much&#13;
                         better infrastructure. Prioritizing these expenditure needs within the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                         limited resource envelope will be critical to maintaining a pro-development stance.&#13;
                         With social benefits for martyrs and disabled increasing significantly in 2014, the&#13;
                         Government will need to consider reforms in the pension and social benefit scheme&#13;
                         going forward. Although more detailed analysis of public expenditures in needed,&#13;
                         there appears to be limited space to adjust expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
Donors have              At the December 2014 London Conference on Afghanistan, the international&#13;
committed to             community reaffirmed its Tokyo commitment of providing US$16 billion in&#13;
considerable             development assistance for Afghanistan over 2012â&#128;&#147;15, sustaining support through&#13;
assistance for           2017 at or near the levels of the past decade, and providing continuing but declining&#13;
Afghanistan              support through the transformation decade. These funds, contingent on satisfactory&#13;
contingent on            reform progress under the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF), would&#13;
satisfactory reform      allow Afghanistan to progress toward sustainability and meet its development and&#13;
progress                 infrastructure targets. Together with earlier pledges on the security side, this means&#13;
                         annual aid of about US$8 billionâ&#128;&#148;roughly equally divided between civil and security&#13;

An ambitious reform       The National Unity Government has initiated a number of bold measures since it&#13;
agenda is already in      took office. Consistent with its strategy for greater self-reliance presented at the 2014&#13;
hand                      London Conference, the Government put forward an ambitious reform plan at the&#13;
                          Senior Officials Meeting in September 2015. The plan is anchored in programs such&#13;
                          as the ARTF Incentive Program, the IMF-supported Staff Monitored Program, and&#13;
                          the Mutual Accountability Framework (see Box 1).&#13;

Three measures      The new reforms will take time to have an impactâ&#128;&#148;as will the current efforts to&#13;
complement the      achieve peace and stability. Meanwhile, given the current economic outlook, poverty,&#13;
Government reform   unemployment, and fragility will continue to increase. Three measures could help to&#13;
program for the     strengthen the impact of the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s reforms:&#13;
short- and medium       ï&#130;·   Restore private sector confidence to stimulate investment. In the short term&#13;
term&#13;
                            necessary reformsâ&#128;&#148;such as the recent ones in procurement and tax policyâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
                            can be viewed as increasing uncertainty. To mitigate this perception, closer&#13;
                            dialogue with the private sector would be key for building support for reform.&#13;
                            Providing greater clarity on the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s economic policy stance could&#13;
                            further enhance investment predictability.&#13;
                        ï&#130;·   Enhance the poverty impact of public expenditure. The fiscal space is very&#13;
                            narrow and without additional financing, the only way to mitigate poverty in&#13;
                            the short term is to reprogram the existing portfolio of development&#13;
                            interventions. In this context, opportunities for expanding direct household&#13;
                            transfers, insurance schemes, and adult literacy programs could be explored&#13;
                            to complement existing service delivery efforts. Our experiences show that&#13;
                            such measures could improve mobility and productivity, and enhance&#13;
                            participation of the poor in the growth process.&#13;
                        ï&#130;·   Rearticulate the needs for security and development assistance. Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                            security strategy and commitments need to be revisited in light of the changes&#13;
                            in the security situation. Achieving greater self-reliance will critically depend&#13;
                            on how realistic and affordable the countryâ&#128;&#153;s security will be in the long term.&#13;
                            Commitments for development financing will likely need to remain at least&#13;
                            at current levels in order to meet Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s extraordinary development&#13;
                            needs. A new National Development Strategy could provide a clearer sense&#13;
                            of direction and vision for donor financing.&#13;

C. Focus Section: Poverty&#13;
Growth without                                   Strong economic growth in Afghanistan during the pre-transition period has not&#13;
poverty reduction                                reduced poverty. Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s per capita GDP grew at an average annual rate of 6.9&#13;
                                                 percent between 2007â&#128;&#147;08 and 2011â&#128;&#147;12. In 2007â&#128;&#147;08, 36 percent of Afghans were&#13;
                                                 poorâ&#128;&#148;that is, more than one in every three Afghans did not have the buying power&#13;
                                                 to satisfy basic food and nonfood needs. Four years later, in 2011â&#128;&#147;12, 36 percent of&#13;
                                                 Afghans were still poor.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 Economic growth, while necessary, is not in and of itself enough to reduce poverty.&#13;
                                                 The problem is in the distribution of the gains. Patterns of growth contributed to&#13;
                                                 widening inequality. Average per capita consumption grew at an annual rate of 1.2&#13;
                                                 percent between 2007â&#128;&#147;08 and 2011â&#128;&#147;12, but growth in consumption was not uniform,&#13;
                                                 thus increasing inequality. While the poorest 20 percent of the population saw a 2&#13;
                                                 percent decline in real per capita expenditure, the richest 20 percent experienced a 9&#13;
                                                 percent increase. Widening inequalities are reflected in an increase of the Gini index,&#13;
                                                 which moved from 29.7 in 2007â&#128;&#147;08 to 31.6 percent in 2011â&#128;&#147;12.&#13;
Characteristics of&#13;
Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s poor:                              Data shows that the characteristics of the poor did not change (Figure 17). Poverty&#13;
rural, agricultural,                             in Afghanistan strongly correlates to geographyâ&#128;&#148;that is, to where people live. Four&#13;
underemployed, and                               out of every five poor people live in rural areas. The mountainous East, Northeast,&#13;
heavily vulnerable                               and West-Central regionsâ&#128;&#148;where almost half of inhabitants are poorâ&#128;&#148;have the&#13;
                                                 lowest per capita consumption and highest likelihood of poverty.&#13;

                                                 Education, type of job, and access to basic services clearly contribute to Afghan&#13;
                                                 poverty. Poor people tend to be illiterate (75.6 percent), and often lack opportunities&#13;
                                                 to educate their children. Poor people face higher unemployment1 (8 percent) or are&#13;

                                                 1   In Afghanistan, as in most developing countries, labor is the most critical asset for poor&#13;
                                                     households. For individual living in poorer households, being engaged in some sort of&#13;
                                                     income-generating activity is a necessity to make ends meet. Poverty, together with the&#13;
                                                     widespread availability of poor-quality jobs in the informal sector, make open&#13;

                      underemployed (41 percent). When employed, poor people are more likely to have a&#13;
                      vulnerable and informal job (84.3 percent), most likely in agriculture (43.6 percent).&#13;
                      Poor people are much less likely to have access to basic services such as electricity&#13;
                      (63.8 percent), safe drinking water (40.3 percent), and sanitation (2.8 percent).&#13;
&#13;
                      Poverty in Afghanistan closely intertwines with natural and manmade risks.&#13;
                      Approximately 84 percent of Afghan households experienced at least one economic&#13;
                      shock in 2011â&#128;&#147;12, and 53 percent suffered from three or more. Due to mountainous&#13;
                      terrain, poor connectivity, and greater reliance on subsistence and rain-fed agriculture,&#13;
                      the poorest regions in the East, Northeast, and West-Central are particularly exposed&#13;
                      and vulnerable to shocks, especially natural hazards. Poor people are among the most&#13;
                      vulnerable, because they are exposed the most to a wide array of risks, and because&#13;
                      they lack means to cope with hazards. Poor households are more likely to use harmful&#13;
                      risk coping mechanisms that may protect them in the short term, but at greater long-&#13;
                      term cost, reducing the likelihood of escaping from poverty in the future.2&#13;
&#13;
International         International spending did not benefit Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s employment sectors, regions,&#13;
spending is an        and people equally. International spending on military and civilian assistance drove&#13;
effective driver of   economic growth in Afghanistan, but growth did not reach the poor. International&#13;
growth, but gains     spending contributed to growth and job creation in the service sector. However, while&#13;
not distributed       the service sector growth created good-quality jobs, especially in the public and in&#13;
equally               health and education-related services, 80 percent of new jobs were in informal day&#13;
                      labor arrangements. Lacking education, the poor could not compete for these jobs,&#13;
                      and moved from vulnerable employment in agriculture to vulnerable employment in&#13;
                      the service sector. On the other hand, aid did not contribute to raising productivity&#13;
                      of the agriculture sector, where most of the poor find employment. While losing its&#13;
                      GDP primacy, the continued importance of agriculture in the Afghan economy&#13;
                      contributed to economic growth volatility due to the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s high reliance on rain-&#13;
                      fed production and vulnerability to weather-related shocks.&#13;
&#13;
                      Tilted towards military operations, international spending benefited high-conflict&#13;
                      areas most, leaving behind the poorest West-Central, Northeast, and East regions.3&#13;
                      Moreover, while in the rest of the country a thriving service sector created new and&#13;

                      agriculture. Greater incidence of and greater vulnerability to natural hazards&#13;
                      contributed to widening inequality between the poorest regions and the rest of the&#13;
                      country.&#13;

                          counterbalanced by the severity of underemployment.&#13;
                      2   Lacking proper means to cope with risk, poor households face extremely unfavorable trade-&#13;
                          offs when hit by a shock and may resort to â&#128;&#156;harmfulâ&#128;&#157; coping mechanisms. These include&#13;
                          things like selling livestock or assets that may affect future productivity and livelihood;&#13;
                          increasing the use of child labor, which leads to intergenerational poverty; or reducing&#13;
                          consumption and going hungry, which affects health, human capital accumulation, and&#13;

                      3   Aid increased in nonlagging regions by 79 percent over the period compared to only 31&#13;

               to improved sanitation all improved, growing annually by approximately 14 percent&#13;
               each. While these achievements have been significant, it is important to note thatâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
               at its pre-transition pace of progressâ&#128;&#148;it will take the country from 20 to 25 years to&#13;
               achieve the same level of adult literacy of other low-income or conflict-affected&#13;
               countries. Further, it would take Afghanistan from 11 to 15 years to achieve the same&#13;
               level of youth literacy, and from 12 to 23 years to achieve the same level of primary-&#13;
               school enrollment.&#13;
&#13;
               Afghanistan is still a long way from closing the widening gap between poor and better-&#13;
               off Afghans. Between 2007â&#128;&#147;08 and 2011â&#128;&#147;12, the gap in education between poor and&#13;
               nonpoor Afghans widened. Children in poor households have significantly lower&#13;
               school enrollment rates than their counterparts in nonpoor households. While urban&#13;
               areas and nonlagging regions saw significant improvement in school enrollment,&#13;
               education outcomes stagnated in rural areas and in lagging regions, mostly due to&#13;
               negative impact of shocks and conflict on girlsâ&#128;&#153; enrollment.&#13;

               Lessons learned&#13;
&#13;
               While economic growth is necessary to reduce poverty, the poor must receive benefits&#13;
               from the growth. For any given rate of growth, the extent of poverty reduction&#13;
               depends on the ability to distribute income, assets, and access to opportunities to the&#13;
               poor. For Afghanistan, the implications of our analysis are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
               ï&#130;§    Strengthening agriculture remains a top priority in Afghanistan to sustain&#13;
                    growth as aid dwindles, and for accelerating poverty reduction. As 75.6 percent&#13;
                    of poor aged 15 and above are illiterate, they cannot take advantage of better&#13;
                    employment opportunities requiring high skills. Thus poverty reduction should&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                              Afghanistan Development Update&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                   benefit the most from growth in sectors like agriculture, where the poor&#13;
                   concentrate.&#13;
&#13;
               ï&#130;§   Afghanistan needs sustained investment in human development to support&#13;
                   economic growth, reduce poverty, and bridge gaps in these areas between&#13;
                   Afghanistan and other countries in the region. While continuing to expand the&#13;
                   supply of education, health, and basic services, the country should devote greater&#13;
                   attention to improving access in underserved areas and among traditionally&#13;
                   underserved groups such as girls and the poor.&#13;
&#13;
               ï&#130;§   Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s poor households need help to manage risk. Geography&#13;
                   (which can increase exposure to natural hazards), economic structure, and high&#13;
                   incidence of poverty (which limits householdsâ&#128;&#153; ability to cope with shocks)&#13;
                   require coordinated assistance to prevent and mitigate risks, and to help people&#13;
                   coping with the impact of shocks. In particular, greater attention should be&#13;
                   devoted to the development of an efficient system of safety nets to promote&#13;
                   poverty reduction, and to complement and improve the effectiveness of&#13;
                   investments in human development and agriculture.&#13;

&amp;#12;APPENDIX: WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM IN AFGHANISTAN&#13;
1. The World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s program in Afghanistan is governed by the joint Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for&#13;
   FY 2012â&#128;&#147;FY 2014, which focuses on three themes: (i) building the legitimacy and capacity of institutions;&#13;
   (ii) equitable service delivery; and (iii) inclusive growth and jobs. The process for preparing the next country&#13;
   strategyâ&#128;&#148;the Country Partnership Framework for Afghanistanâ&#128;&#148;has been launched, and work on the&#13;
   Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) is in progress.&#13;
&#13;
2. Since 2002, the International Development Association (IDA) has committed a total of US$3.12 billion in&#13;
   grants (86 percent) and credits (14 percent) in Afghanistan. Thirty seven development and emergency-&#13;
   reconstruction projects and four budget-support operations have been committed as of end-August 2015.&#13;
   In addition, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) has generated US$7.99 billion from 33&#13;
   donors, and committed US$3.61 billion for the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s recurrent costs and US$3.79 billion for&#13;
   government investment programs. At end of August 2015, the active IDA portfolio was worth US$725.98&#13;
   million and the active ARTF investment portfolio was worth US$2.5 billion.&#13;
&#13;
3. The Bank also administers the ARTFâ&#128;&#148;the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s largest single-country multi-donor trust&#13;
   fund. The ARTF provides grant support to Afghanistan based on a three-year rolling financing strategy.&#13;
   Together, the IDA and the ARTF provide close to US$1 billion per year in grant resources (about US$150&#13;
   million from IDA and about US$800â&#128;&#147;US$900 million from the ARTF). The ARTF is a key vehicle for&#13;
   providing the Government with predictable and transparent on-budget financing and provides a platform&#13;
   for policy dialogue between Government and donors.&#13;
&#13;
4. In FY 2015, the World Bank Board approved additional financing for an existing projectâ&#128;&#148;the Second&#13;
   Customs Reform and Trade Facilitation Projectâ&#128;&#148;in the amount of US$21.5 million. No new projects were&#13;
   approved under the ARTF during the political transition period. Funds were, however, allocated to ongoing&#13;
   projects for a total of US$450 million, which includes US$50 million for the National Horticulture and&#13;
   Livestock Project, US$100 million for the National Solidarity Program III, US$100 million for the Rural&#13;
   Access Program, and US$200 million for the System Enhancement for Health in Transition Project. In FY&#13;
   2015, US$419.56 million was disbursed under the Recurrent Cost Window, including the baseline financing&#13;
   (US$125 million), Incentive Program (US$132.5 million, of which US$65 million was through the O&amp;M&#13;
   Facility), and additional donor grants of US$146.9 million through ad hoc mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
5. The World Bank continues to engage in rigorous analytical work and places large emphasis on policy&#13;
   dialogue. These nonlending activities have been supportive of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending program and have played&#13;
   a crucial role in informing government of its strategic choices and advancing dialogue between the&#13;
   Government of Afghanistan and its international development partners. In recent years, four pieces of&#13;
   analytical work stand out: Transition Economics, Resources Corridors, Poverty Analysis, and the&#13;
   Agriculture Sector Review. The Bank also prepared Policy Notes on key sectors of the economy to help&#13;
   guide its policy dialogue with the new administration and launched the preparation of a comprehensive&#13;
   revenue analysis.&#13;
&#13;
6. The portfolio of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Afghanistan has more than doubled since&#13;
   FY 2008â&#128;&#148;from around US$8 million to about US$135 million to date. IFC is following an integrated&#13;
   advisory and investment strategy. It is focused on improving the investment climate, building capacity, and&#13;
   supporting selective investments in sectors with high development impact and job creation. Currently,&#13;
   IFCâ&#128;&#153;s portfolio includes two investments in the telecommunications sector and two operations in the&#13;
   financial markets. Going forward, IFC is looking to expand its investment program in Afghanistan, in the&#13;
   areas of infrastructure, finance, manufacturing, agribusiness, and services.&#13;

&amp;#12;7. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has US$154 million of gross exposure in&#13;
   Afghanistan, supporting telecoms and agri-business projects. In 2013 MIGA launched its Conflict Affected&#13;
   and Fragile Economies Facility, which is supporting the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s exposure in Afghanistan. MIGA is&#13;
   currently supporting three projects in Afghanistan, of which one is a joint effort with IFC in the telecoms&#13;
   sector (supporting telecom operator MTN). The other two operations are MIGA-only dairy and cashmere&#13;
   production projects.&#13;

            Afghanistan development update (October 2015)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            More frequent incidences of violence in
            Afghanistan, as well as delays in the elections process and
            cabinet formation, continued to fuel uncertainty and
            affected investor confidence in 2014 and the first half of
            2015. Economic growth slowed to 1.3 percent in 2014, down
            from 3.7 percent a year earlier. Unlike in previous years,
            agriculture did not contribute much to growth in 2014.
            Production levels were high for a third year in a row but
            did not supersede the strong output in 2013. Growth was
            mainly driven by services and a slight expansion of
            industries where an increase in construction activities
            outweighed lower production in manufacturing. Private
            investment activities showed strong signs of slowdown in
            2014, evidenced by a drop of nearly 50 percent in new firm
            registrations since 2012. The National Unity Government has
            embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to revitalize the
            economy, tackle corruption, and improve investment climate.
            However, it will take time for these reforms to have an
            impact, and it is yet unclear how much they will mitigate
            the high risks stemming from the fragile security
            environment. Growing trends in security and pension and wage
            spending over the medium term require immediate attention.
            Afghanistan faces significant financing shortages for both
            civilian and security spending. Therefore, securing
            continued high levels of donor financing over the coming
            years is of critical importance for fiscal stability in the
            country. The fragile security environment and financing
            constraints, compounded by weak governance capacity, pose
            serious challenges to service delivery in Afghanistan. Any
            setback in reform implementation would further slowdown the
            pace of human capital accumulation in Afghanistan and reduce
            future prospects of growth and poverty reduction.
