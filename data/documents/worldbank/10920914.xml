&#13;
The Environment and Natural Resources Division of EDI (EDIEN) conducted an International&#13;
Workshop on Community-Based Natural Resource Management in Washington, D.C., from&#13;
May 10-14, 1998. The 5-day workshop was intended for policy-makers, practitioners, and&#13;
disseminators from developing countries and transition economies who are engaged in some&#13;
aspect of institutional reform to improve the community-based management of natural&#13;
resources. The workshop had 4 specific objectives: 1) to facilitate a learning dialogue among&#13;
participants from all over the world; 2) to identify and promote awareness of key institutional&#13;
issues; 3) to generate information and learn about viable institutional options; and 4) to&#13;
enhance the capacity of participants to bring about positive institutional reforms. Two&#13;
hundred participants from 60 countries attended the workshop, primarily from the public&#13;
sector, private sector, and academic institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The workshop was evaluated by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) using an end-of-workshop&#13;
questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 93 respondents (46.5%). Twenty-eight&#13;
respondents work for international organizations (30.1%), 41 (44.1%) for national&#13;
organizations, 10 (10.8%) for regional/local governments, 7 (7.5%) for non-governmental&#13;
community organizations, and 5 (5.4%) for other institutions. Two respondents' affiliations&#13;
were unknown. Twenty-five out of the 93 respondents (26.9%) were women. The end-of-&#13;
workshop questionnaire consisted of 2 sections. The first section asked respondents to rate&#13;
the extent to which the workshop met its performance objectives. The second section asked&#13;
the level of respondents' knowledge about the themes presented in the workshop, before and&#13;
after completing the workshop. A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1 = minimum to&#13;
5 = maximum was used to rate respondents' answer to each question. Following is a&#13;
summary of the evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The relevancy of the workshop to respondents had the highest overall workshop&#13;
        performance rating (mean=4.17). About 78% of the respondents rated 4 or 5 on a 5-&#13;
        point scale for this question. Respondents from the regional/local governments (N=10)&#13;
        felt that the workshop was particularly relevant to their work, giving this indicator a&#13;
        mean score of 4.45.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The workshop presented a total of 20 case studies covering all geographical regions&#13;
        and 4 specific workshop themes. The overall mean score for the usefulness of the&#13;
        case studies was 3.90 out of 5.0. Respondents whose scope of work are at the&#13;
        national level (N=41) gave this indicator 3.79, while those who work at either the&#13;
        international (N=28) or regional/local and community level (N=17) had a mean score of&#13;
        4.0. Results also indicated that the respondents who participated in the working group&#13;
        for the East Asia and the Pacific region (N=17) found the case studies more useful&#13;
        (mean=4.0) than the 6 respondents who attended the working group for the Europe,&#13;
        Central Asia, and the Middle East region (mean=3.67).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
lAmong the 4 workshop objectives, the workshop particularly helped respondents&#13;
 identify key institutional issues of community-based natural resource management.&#13;
 This objective received one of the highest ratings of the four objectives, 3.79 out of 5.0.&#13;
 Seventeen respondents from the regional/local governments and community&#13;
 organizations felt that the workshop helped them most in their learning about&#13;
 programs that enhance community-based resource management (mean=3.71).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lWhen asked about the overall usefulness of the workshop, 70% of all respondents&#13;
 rated 4 or 5 (mean = 3.78). The rating was particularly high among those from the&#13;
 regional/local governments (mean=4.0).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lRespondents' opinions about the workshop were mixed on two issues. These were&#13;
 the degree to which various options presented in the discussions could help alleviate&#13;
 poverty in respondents' countries (mean=2.95), and the usefulness of the field trip&#13;
 organized during the workshop (mean=2.78). These were the only items that fell below&#13;
 3.0. The mean scores of the 41 respondents from national organizations were the&#13;
 lowest among all subgroups on these two indicators, 2.88 and 2.73, respectively. The&#13;
 content and delivery of these areas need to be reviewed as to how to increase their&#13;
 relevance and usefulness for future workshops.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lPre/post self-assessment of knowledge showed positive increases in the level of&#13;
 respondents' knowledge about the 4 major themes of the workshop. The mean scores&#13;
 of the 4 issues were in the range of 3.0-3.61 before the workshop and the 3.62-3.94&#13;
 range after the workshop. The percentage knowledge gains among all respondents&#13;
 varied from 9.3% (the participatory process of organizing community-based groups) to&#13;
 20.6% (alternative approaches to managing conflicts in the use of natural resources).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe theme on effective operational linkages between public, private, and community-&#13;
 based groups in managing natural resources had the largest post-workshop gains&#13;
 among respondents whose scope of work are at the regional/local or community level.&#13;
 The mean score increased from 3.28 to 4.06 (23.8%). Results indicated that women&#13;
 (N=25) also had the largest increase on this theme (17.6%). Men (N=68) had the&#13;
 largest percentage increase on the alternative approaches to conflict management&#13;
 (21.9%). Respondents working at the national level also learned most from the&#13;
 workshop on the alternative approaches to conflict management theme. They had a&#13;
 relatively low knowledge of the theme before the workshop (mean = 2.83). The post-&#13;
 workshop knowledge level increased by 25.8% (mean = 3.56), the largest percentage&#13;
 for this group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe information obtained from pre/post self-assessment should be interpreted with&#13;
 caution. It reflects the degree to which respondents believed they learned the issues,&#13;
 but does not measure how much they actually learned.&#13;
