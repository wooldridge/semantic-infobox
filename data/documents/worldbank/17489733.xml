Administration Arrangement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donor,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Arrangement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   The Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to&#13;
finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donor acknowledges&#13;
that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset&#13;

Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept&#13;

2.3    Donor agrees to deposit its Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in the Administration&#13;
Arrangement. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the Holding Currency,&#13;
promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall&#13;
convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate&#13;
fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional&#13;
financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;

Contribution, an amount equal to five percent (5%) as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.3    The Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions significantly&#13;
differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration Arrangement,&#13;
or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a&#13;
change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments&#13;
made to the Administration Arrangement and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions&#13;
that are provided as amendments to supplement existing Administration Arrangements.&#13;
