A. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
1.        Country Background. The Maldives i s a chain o f Indian Ocean islands spread over a&#13;
distance o f 900 kilometers, and located between northern latitude 4 to slightly south o f the&#13;
equator. The land area, which covers about 26 geographic atolls, i s grouped into 20&#13;
administrative atolls. The population o f the Maldives i s about 300,000. The country faces two&#13;
main geographic challenges: (a) the absence o f a significant land mass, which has resulted in a&#13;
highly dispersed population, and (b) the low altitude o f the existing islands. The country has&#13;
1,190 islands, o f which 198 are inhabited. Of these islands, only 33 have a land area greater than&#13;
one square kilometer. One third o f the inhabited islands have a population o f less than 500 and 70&#13;
percent o f the inhabited islands have a population o f less than 1,000. This extremely low&#13;
population density makes the Maldives unique, even among small island archipelagic states. It&#13;
also raises the cost o f delivering social services and of public administration, as there i s hardly&#13;
any scope to generate economies o f scale. The altitude of most o f the islands in the Maldives i s&#13;
very low, just above sea level. As a result, rising sea levels cause many islands to disappear and&#13;
new ones to appear. This has rendered some inhabited islands ecologically vulnerable, while&#13;
other islands have become too densely populated to sustain their communities. The greater Mal6&#13;
area, already home to 70,000 people or almost a quarter o f the population, is o f specific concern,&#13;
with increasing strain on social and public services caused by continuing in-migration from other&#13;
parts o f the archipelago.&#13;
&#13;
2.        The tsunami and its effect. The tsunami traveled at over 700 kilometers per hour and&#13;
reached Maldives at 9:20 AM on 26 December 2004. Tidal waves ranging from 4 to 14 feet were&#13;
reported in all parts o f the country. More than 1300 people suffered injuries; 82 people are&#13;
confirmed dead and another 25 are missing and feared dead. Unlike other countries affected by&#13;
the tsunami, Maldives experienced a disaster o f national proportion. Thirty nine islands were&#13;
significantly damaged and nearly a third o f the Maldives' 300,000 people were severely affected.&#13;
Fourteen islands were completely destroyed and had to be evacuated. Nearly 12,000 people have&#13;
been displaced from their islands, (initially 28,000 were displaced) and another 8,500 people are&#13;
temporarily relocated to other places on their own island; thus 7 percent o f the population o f&#13;
Maldives were displaced. The force o f the waves caused widespread devastation o f shelter and&#13;
infrastructure inthe atolls. Flooding caused by the tsunami wiped out electricity on many islands,&#13;
destroying also their communication links.Water supply was disrupted in about 15 percent o f the&#13;
islands and 25 percent had major damage to the essential infrastructure such as jetties and harbors&#13;
that links these islands with Mal&amp; Electricity supply in many affected islands has yet to be&#13;
restored. The impact on an economy largely based on tourism, fisheries, and agriculture will be&#13;
substantive. Livelihoods o f thousands have been undermined and will continue to suffer.&#13;
&#13;
3.        The socialfabric o f the tsunami hit islands inthe Maldives has been seriously impacted&#13;
by extensive physical damage, loss o f life and livelihoods, and displacement o f people. Most&#13;
affected people lost savings kept in cash in the house. The affected communities have a&#13;
heightened vulnerability to poverty. The impact o f the losses has been exacerbated by the shock&#13;
and fear caused by the tsunami. Although traumatized, island communities have demonstrated a&#13;
strong sense o f independence, resilience and cohesion in mobilizing themselves into groups to&#13;
remove rubble, initiate small scale reconstruction activities on mosques and houses, distribute&#13;
relief supplies, and sheltering those made homeless. In a country o f many small islands,&#13;
community organizations have traditionally played an important role in providing public and&#13;
collective services and inmany other areas o f local life. The capacity o f communities to mobilize&#13;
themselves represents one o f the most important assets for the reconstruction work ahead.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 4 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Community mobilization and self-help needs to form a cornerstone and a key organizing&#13;
principle for demand-driven local recoveryprograms.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Country Vulnerability. The main risk factor for the country i s the extremely low&#13;
elevationwith the average elevationbeing 1.5 meters above sea level. This increases the risks o f a&#13;
tsunami and vulnerability to the potential effects o f global warming. O f the 198 inhabited islands,&#13;
88 face perennial beach erosion. Wide dispersal o f population across very small islands and their&#13;
remoteness and inaccessibility creates diseconomies o f scale hampering both development and&#13;
relief efforts. Maldives has been spared from natural disasters and i s generally not affected by&#13;
cyclones which affect other areas o f the Indian Ocean. Consequently, Maldives has focused on&#13;
what it saw as its main risk: global warming and consequent rising sea-levels. Nevertheless, the&#13;
natural risks are compounded by the extremely high economic dependence on tourism and&#13;
imports.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Ongoing effort. The Government responded within hours by creating a National&#13;
Emergency Center which groups all government departments including decision makers under&#13;
one roof and which also coordinates the relief efforts by donors and non-government&#13;
organizations (NGO). The Government has been characterized by transparency and a strong&#13;
desire to avoid overlap and waste o fresources.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Risks. The Maldives has a good track record o f governance and implementation o f&#13;
programs. Nevertheless, given the emergency nature o f this operation, certain risks do exist: (a)&#13;
the Government may be overloaded by different projects requiring different procedures from&#13;
various donors. (b) income and livelihood support could be imperfectly targeted. (c) Government&#13;
assistance, whether in cash or kind, could create a dependency syndrome and undermine private&#13;
financial markets. (d) the urgency o f providing support under the different components could&#13;
undermine community consultation processes.&#13;
&#13;
7.       Mitigation Measures. (a) The creation o f a one-stop Tsunami Relief and Reconstruction&#13;
Fund (TRRF) will help to mitigate the first risk. (b) inter-Ministerial task forces with army and&#13;
auditor involvement, transparent auditing o f the TRRF, active participation o f island-level&#13;
Women's Development Committees, and Island Development Committees will act as strong&#13;
deterrent to abuse o f government support; (c) upfront announcement o f transparent criteria for&#13;
eligibility o f government support under the livelihoods component will prevent expectations o f&#13;
and reliance on public support in the future, contributing to mitigating the risk o f dependency&#13;
syndrome; (d) the strong tradition in Maldives o f grass root level community action in consort&#13;
with local government will, it i s hoped, continue, even in times o f distress imposed by the&#13;
tsunami.&#13;
&#13;
B. IDA RESPONSESTRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
8.       Damage and needs assessment. Immediately after the tsunami, the World Bank sent a&#13;
teamjointly with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the UNsystem to assess the damages.&#13;
Total damages are estimated to be about US$470 million, close to 62 percent o f GDP. About&#13;
$298 million o f this are direct damages to physical assets, representing about 8 percent o f the&#13;
replacement cost o f the national capital stock. The rest are indirect damages (such as lost tourism&#13;
income). The largest source o f direct damages i s the housing sector and the largest source o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 5 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
indirect damage i s the tourism sector, stemmingfrom a sharp drop intourist arrivals'. The cost o f&#13;
restoring the economy to pre-tsunami levels i s estimated to be US$406 million. Government&#13;
revenues, which depend heavily on tourism, are expected to drop by US$60 million, equivalent to&#13;
about 25 percent o f total revenues. The decline in revenues will impair the capacity o f the&#13;
government to finance the reconstruction program. Table 1 in Appendix 1provides an overview&#13;
o f the damage and reconstruction costs estimates arrived at by the joint World Bank-ADB-UN&#13;
mission. Table 2 o f Appendix 1 matches the sector specific estimated recovery needs with the&#13;
foreign financing that has been identified to date.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Governments long term strategy and its linkage to the tsunami response. The principal&#13;
impact o f the tsunami on the Government's development strategy will be to accelerate the process&#13;
of population concentration. The tsunami lent new urgency to the policy o f population&#13;
concentration, which will go a long way to reduce diseconomies o f scale in service provision and&#13;
will provide protectionagainst sea-level rise. Another impact o f the tsunami has beena rethinking&#13;
o f environmental measures neededto defend focus islands-a         new plan for creation of safe focus&#13;
islands has been proposed. The proposed safe island design would involve elevated zones, high&#13;
buildings, special drainage zones, and sloping revetments for environmental protection. The&#13;
Government's population consolidationpolicy rules out forced resettlement. The Government has&#13;
re-stated its policy against forced resettlement ina recent communication to donors.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Regional development strategies. The government has developed a two pronged strategy&#13;
to distribute the benefits o f economic growth to all parts o f the country. The first element o f the&#13;
strategy i s to develop two regional centers, one in Addu Atoll in the far south and the second in&#13;
Haa Dhalu Atoll in the far north. These centers are designed to have airports, good ports and&#13;
other social and infrastructure facilities. The regional centers are to be complemented by safe&#13;
islands on different atolls to act as atoll service hubs and growth centers. The government i s also&#13;
seelung to distribute the benefits o f tourism to all atolls by allowing new resorts to be opened in&#13;
the atolls which currently lack resorts. The opening o f the new international airport and&#13;
internationalport inAddu Atoll will bringtourism and other economic opportunities within reach&#13;
o f the more isolated southern atolls. The government expects these developments to reduce&#13;
regional differentials and promote growth and employment opportunities outside o f Male.&#13;
&#13;
11.      The provision of social services in the Maldives poses special challenges given the&#13;
dispersion o f its population. The country's public expenditure, in line with other small island&#13;
economies with dispersed populations, i s high at 40 percent o f Gross Domestic Product (GDP).&#13;
Consequently, public expenditure management poses a major challenge to the Government. The&#13;
Government's previous strategy to widen access to services across the archipelago consisted o f&#13;
creating facilities and providing services on all islands, including those with small populations. In&#13;
the education and health sectors, this approach has ledto the establishment o f a primary school, a&#13;
primary health post, and other social infrastructure on each inhabited island. Establishing and&#13;
maintaining secondary schools and more advanced health facilities on each island would be&#13;
extremely expensive. Inaddition, public expenditure o f 40 percent o f national income currently&#13;
supports a basic level o f local government services to atolls, with advanced services concentrated&#13;
only inthe central Mal6 region. Widening access to highquality local government services to the&#13;
atolls i s also likely to be extremely costly. Hence, the government needs to maximize cost&#13;
effectiveness in developing strategies to improve access and develop the quality o f education,&#13;
health care and local government services inthe outer atolls.&#13;

' The indirect damage estimates need to be treated with caution particularly when it comes to tourism and&#13;
livelihood damages.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
12.      Communications. The development o f a nationalbroad-bandnetwork to provide access to&#13;
internet based public services within atolls i s also an important element o f the government's&#13;
strategy to improve the coverage and quality o f local government. Currently, the cost o f intra-&#13;
atoll and inter-atoll communication and information transmission i s severely constrained by the&#13;
high cost o f telecommunications and the absence o f adequate transmission capacity. The&#13;
Government strategy o f developing a broad-band network would enable focus island hubs to&#13;
supply services to the primary islands within their atolls more cheaply and effectively. In&#13;
addition, a broad-band network would facilitate inter-atoll communications by substantially&#13;
reducing costs and increasing the volume o f information that can be transmitted.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Linkage to the WorldBank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). A major element inthe&#13;
last CAS for the Maldives has been to support the Government's population consolidation policy&#13;
as a protection against rising sea-levels and to improve public services. The next CAS will most&#13;
likely continue this support.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Rationalefor IDAfinancial support. The tsunami which hit Maldives on 26 December,&#13;
2004 was a nation-wide disaster which caused severe damage to the physical infrastructure o f&#13;
many islands. The tsunami has set back the highlevels o f social progress and prosperity achieved&#13;
in recent years. The physical damage has led to severe human suffering inasmuch as large&#13;
segments o f the population have lost their dwellings, lifetime assets, savings, and sources o f&#13;
livelihood. IDA support would meet an urgent need for reconstruction finance and, by providing&#13;
resources in a timely and transparent manner through the Government's TRRF, IDA would help&#13;
set an example in terms o f harmonizing donor procedures and avoid over-burdening the limited&#13;
managerial resources o f the Government.&#13;
&#13;
C. PROJECTOBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
15.      The project objectives are to support the efforts o f the Government o f the Maldives to&#13;
carry out a program o f rehabilitation and reconstruction related to the damages caused by the&#13;
tsunami o f 26 December 2004.&#13;
&#13;
D. PROJECTDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
16.      This operation will be implemented over a period o f three years, with much o f the work&#13;
expected to be completed during the first year. IDA support will be routed through the Tsunami&#13;
Relief and Reconstruction Fund (TRRF) established under the aegis o f the Ministry o f Finance&#13;
and Treasury with the purpose to assure transparency in the use o f funds. The operation will have&#13;
the following components:&#13;
&#13;
Component 1:Restorationof livelihoodsconsists o f (a) safety net cash transfers to the affected&#13;
population for their subsistence needs, and (b) a program to restore lost or damaged assets o f&#13;
affected enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
         Sub-Component a: Safety net cash grants to households affected               by the tsunami&#13;
         (US$5.6 million fi-om the IDA grant). The Govemment has begun providing one-time&#13;
         cash grants to families seriously affected by the tsunami2. Under this program, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  This program is ongoing and an amount of Rf. 30 million has been disbursed to the affected population&#13;
with an estimate o f additional Rf. 20 million to be disbursed shortly. GoM has used budgetary funds for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 - 7 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Govemment has started distributing Rf.1,500 (US$117) per capita to families whose&#13;
        houses were completely destroyed; Rf.1,000 per capita to families whose houses were&#13;
        partially damaged; and Rf.500 per capita to families whose houses are intact but&#13;
        household items swept away. This amount i s intended to help affected families cover&#13;
        immediate expenses on food and household essentials. The Govemment i s also preparing&#13;
        a follow-up safety net program targeting the poorest and most vulnerable among the&#13;
        affected population; this new programwould provide a small monthly cashpayment for a&#13;
        limited period o f 10 months to poor and heavily affected families. The purpose o f&#13;
        limiting the period and narrowly defining the target groups is to avoid developing a&#13;
        dependency syndrome.&#13;
&#13;
        Sub-Component b: Restoration of Livelihoods Program (RLP) (US$3 .O million from&#13;
        the IDA credit). The government has decided on a policy o f urgent support for livelihood&#13;
        restoration, the Restoration o f Livelihoods Program. This program would provide sub-&#13;
        grants for restoration o f assets (e.g. fishing vessels, fishing gear, fish processing&#13;
        equipment, agricultural tools, and other). The RLP i s targeted to micro and small scale&#13;
        enterprises in the affected islands who lost or suffered damages to their income&#13;
        generating assets. The support under this program will help these enterprises restart their&#13;
        businesses, and thereby kick start economic recovery and employment at the local level.&#13;
        The eligibility criteria for assistance under this program cover enterprises whose assets&#13;
        were damaged or lost from the tsunami, and which were not insured.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2: Increase school capacity on islands receivingthe populationdisplaced by the&#13;
tsunami (US$5.0 million from the IDA Credit). The tsunami has made at least seven islands&#13;
uninhabitable. The population displaced from these seven islands needs to be resettled&#13;
immediately. The receiving islands will need additional schools and facilities to accommodate the&#13;
increasing student population. Temporary classrooms erected to accommodate the students will&#13;
need to be converted into permanent classrooms. Moreover, certain islands including Lamu Gan&#13;
are expected to receive a substantial population increase and at least one new school will be&#13;
needed here. The proposed assistance will finance additional permanent classrooms and the new&#13;
school. The component will be implementedby the line Ministry.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: ImplementationSupport to the Post-tsunamiReconstructionProgram.($0.4&#13;
million). The post-tsunami reconstruction program currently under planning will add&#13;
considerably to the normal workload o f all levels o f government. Since this increase inwork load&#13;
i s temporary, it does not justify additional permanent staff. This component will temporarily&#13;
increase the capacity o f implementing Ministries to manage the additional workload by financing&#13;
project management specialists.&#13;
&#13;
17.     Justzjkation of the project and emergenq procedure. The project will help to start the&#13;
process o f recovery after the tsunami. Urgent support i s needed because o f the scale o f damages,&#13;
and because the Government's ability to respond has been impaired by the adverse impact on its&#13;
revenues from import and tourism related taxes. Tables 1 and 2 o f Appendix 1provide sector-by-&#13;
sector details o f the damages, reconstruction needs, and foreign financing already identified.&#13;
Large gaps exist in all sectors; IDA support would help close those gaps, and by routing support&#13;
through the TRRF in a transparent and streamlined manner, it would also have a catalytic impact&#13;
on other donor support. The sectors to be supported were chosen, in part, because o f previous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
these payments, which will be retroactively financed by IDA. Once complete, this program will have&#13;
reached approximately 63,000 beneficiaries.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
World Bank experience through investment lending or analytical work inthe sectors; the urgency&#13;
o f support needs and the soundness o f the government's reconstruction strategy; and the absence&#13;
o f commitments from other donors to the given sector.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Lessons from Previous Emergency Operations. The World Bank experience in&#13;
emergency operation shows that the first element o f response should focus on restoring&#13;
livelihoods so that people can earn incomes and help themselves. This i s covered by the first&#13;
component o f the project. Another element to consider i s to avoid overburdeningthe Government&#13;
with multiple, additional donor imposedprocedures and processes. This is addressed by worhng&#13;
through the integrated structure o f the TRRF and a consolidated project Operations Manual used&#13;
by all participating donors. Finally, it is very important to design the program in a flexible&#13;
manner, as new or unforeseen issues may arise which will need response. This need is addressed&#13;
by keeping the project objectives quite broad, which would allow the borrower flexibility to&#13;
address unanticipatedneeds.&#13;
&#13;
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTAND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
19.      Tsunami Relief and Reconstruction Fund (TRRF). The Government of Maldives (GoM)&#13;
has set up a TRRF under the aegis of the Ministry o f Finance and Treasury (MoFT) by way o f&#13;
presidential decree (equivalent to an Act in Maldives) dated January 9, 2005. The TRRF will&#13;
receive resources from local and intemational sources, and channel these resources to&#13;
expenditures for relief, reconstruction, and management activities. Inaddition, it will also account&#13;
for and report on in-kindgrants and funds passed on directly by donors. The TRRF will operate&#13;
as a separate fund under the budget o f G o M and will enable G o M to transparently delineate and&#13;
account for tsunami related assistance and ensure effective usage o f funds.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Financing Plan. A joint team from World Bank, ADB, and UNhave recently completed&#13;
a needs and damage assessment, estimating the total public financing needs for reconstruction at&#13;
about $304 million. The TRRF i s in the process o f tying up resources and matching them with&#13;
projected sector usage. A financing plan i s under preparation by MoFT which will identify the&#13;
sectors and activities in which reconstruction financing i s needed and the probable funding&#13;
sources a~ailable.~ the donor commitments and modalities are yet to be firmed up, the&#13;
                      As&#13;
financing   plan will need to be dynamic and subject to periodic revisions (bi-monthly).&#13;
Arrangements would be put in place at the government accounting bureau at M o F T to track the&#13;
actual expenditures to collate and report against the plan.&#13;
&#13;
21.      Staffing and functions of the TRRF, The TRRF will be operated by M o F T using their&#13;
regular staff, with oversight provided by the TRRF monitoring Board appointedby the President.&#13;
This board comprises seven members: three senior civil servants (including the Auditor General&#13;
o f Maldives as Chairman), three representatives from the private sector, and one representative&#13;
from the international donor agencies. The Board's functionalities include ensuring effective&#13;
implementation o f the relief and reconstruction work; monitoring and supervising the approved&#13;
activities; reviewing the operational reports including expenditures; and maintaining transparency&#13;
inthe operations bycollating anddisseminating information onthe utilizationo f funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The donor funding is in the process o f being negotiated. To avoid delays in implementing its&#13;
reconstruction program, GoM i s proposing to match its prioritized program for Tsunami Relief and&#13;
Reconstruction in various sectors with the donors available to commit funds, through a dynamic business&#13;
plan. This will mitigate any fiduciary risk o f donor overlap and will enable GoM to continue with the&#13;
momentum o frelief andreconstruction work, without waiting for all-donor consensus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 9 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22.      Operations Manual of the TRRF. The management, organizational structure and&#13;
implementation arrangements including procurement and financial management will be detailed&#13;
inthe operations manual of the Fund, currently under finalization. The operations manual of the&#13;
TRRF lays out the decision making structure for the TRRF. It also details all implementation&#13;
issues includingprocurement and financial management procedures.&#13;
&#13;
23.      Implementing component l(a), targeted cash assistance to people whose houses were&#13;
damaged by the tsunami. The G o M i s in process o f distributing cash grants to the affected&#13;
population to meet basic subsistence and livelihood support needs. Multi-sectoral task teams&#13;
(including the island committees and local groups) have been formed for distributing the cash&#13;
entitlement determined as per the scheme. These task teams include a representative from the&#13;
office o f Auditor General (who performs a pre-audit function on the team), one from the National&#13;
Security Service4 (defense service of GoM) and 4-5 senior functionaries from other line&#13;
ministries, who visit the affected islands, survey the affected properties and individuals, scrutinize&#13;
and verify the beneficiaries with the data made available from the repository, register them, and&#13;
make the payments. Receipts are obtained through signatures and finger imprints from the&#13;
beneficiaries and the list i s prepared at the end o f every day, where it i s signed by each of the task&#13;
team members to establish intemal control and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
24.      Beneficiaries are being identified and verified ina process that involves: (a) the atoll and&#13;
island administration, (b) community groups which are strong inthese small island communities,&#13;
(c) visual damage inspection by the task teams, and (d) the Ministry o f Gender, Family&#13;
Development and Social Security. The latter has the experience with targeting cash assistance&#13;
programs in the past. The task teams after returning from the islands hand over the duly signed&#13;
and verified lists to the National Security Service (NSS) along with the balance cash. The data&#13;
(from the lists given by the task teams) are currently being compiled at the disaster management&#13;
centre with the help o f the Auditor General's office and would ultimately be updated on a web&#13;
site for the general public (social audit). This design could be improved further by ensuring better&#13;
dissemination by posting the lists o f payment immediately in the offices o f the local island&#13;
committees.&#13;
&#13;
25.      Follow-up cash assistance (also component 1(a)). Additional assistance will be required&#13;
to the poorest and most vulnerable o f the affected population. The disbursement and&#13;
implementation arrangements o f this safety net program will be similar to the assistance offered&#13;
to those whose houses sustained damages, with the following exceptions: (a) the target group will&#13;
be much smaller (approximately 4,000 individuals); (b) the targeting criteria will emphasize the&#13;
poor and vulnerable such as the elderly, the disabled, and single parents with many children&#13;
among the affected population; (c) the amounts disbursed will depend to some extent on family&#13;
size, and will not depend on the extent o f damage sustained to the house, and (d) this assistance&#13;
will bepaid out on a monthly basis for a period o fupto 10months.&#13;
&#13;
26.      Implementation of Component 1(b): Restoration of Livelihoods Program (RLP). The&#13;
Livelihoods Restoration Programwould be implemented by the Ministryo f Finance and Treasury&#13;
over a period o f 10 months from the effectiveness date o f the ERL. The eligibility criteria for&#13;
grant support under RLP would be micro and small scale enterprises (MSEs) affected by the&#13;
tsunami that have lost or suffered damages to income generating or business assets which were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  National Security Service has a very strong reputationo f assisting insuch emergencies. It is also handling&#13;
the warehousing, maintaining inventory and transportation for the physical aid that has been received&#13;
during the Tsunami emergency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 10-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
not insured. MoFT will receive IDA funds for the I2LP and would be responsible for providing&#13;
the cash grants directly to the beneficiaries. The government would verify MSEs receiving the&#13;
sub-grants against the eligibility criteria and would maintain a record o f the name and address o f&#13;
the MSEs and the type o f business, estimated value o f the damaged business asset, and the&#13;
amount o f grant provided to them. At the end o f the program, MoFT would also carry out an&#13;
impact assessment o f the grants provided and would have the accounts o f the RLP audited by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
27.     Implementation of Component 2: Increase school capacity on islands receiving the&#13;
population displaced by the tsunami. This component will be implemented by the Ministry of&#13;
Education with support from the existing Program Monitoring and Coordination (PMC) section&#13;
which has extensive experience with implementing IDA projects. The needs for reconstruction&#13;
assistance have already been identified in detail by school and by island.&#13;
&#13;
28.     Implementation of       Component 3:Implementation         Support to the Post-tsunami&#13;
Reconstruction Program . The Ministryo f Finance and Treasury with input from the concemed&#13;
line Ministry will decide on whether there i s a need for temporary additional support to the line&#13;
Ministryfor implementingthe Post-Tsunami programand whether the work could easily be done&#13;
by existing permanent staff. If the need is determined to exist, the need would be fulfilled by&#13;
national or international experts worlung for the period o f the Post-Tsunami reconstruction.&#13;

&#13;
Summary of Financial ManagementAssessment&#13;
&#13;
29.     The Government o f Maldives (GoM) i s in the process o f finalizing the implementation&#13;
arrangements for the Tsunami Relief And Reconstruction Program with various donors, which&#13;
will ensure transparency and efficient fiduciary arrangements. The IDA financing, along with&#13;
other donor finance, will be routed through the TRRF operated by the Ministry o f Finance and&#13;
Treasury (MoFT), which, subject to meeting the conditions for disbursement, i s inthe process o f&#13;
establishing a financial management (FM) system that will be adequate to account and report for&#13;
project resources and expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
30.     Ithas been identified that IDA credit and grant will support safety net cashtransfers, sub-&#13;
grants to small businesses for restoration o f assets and livelihoods, education sector&#13;
reconstruction, and support for program management. Total IDA assistance up to an amount o f&#13;
US$14million i s envisaged. All the payments from TRRF would be made on the basis o f duly&#13;
certified and verified invoices and other supporting documents, per detailed operational and&#13;
business procedures as described inthe Operations Manual. These payments would be made on a&#13;
centralized basis by the government accounting bureau at MoFT. The proposed arrangements o f&#13;
routing all fund flows through TRRF under MoFT will: i)significantly reduce the risk o f delays&#13;
inthe availability of funds at the operational level, ii)increase transparency, speed, accuracy, and&#13;
reporting for operations, iii)enable TRRF to disburse funds in a timely manner for smooth&#13;
implementation, and iv) replenishthe accounts quickly to maintain program momentum.&#13;
&#13;
31.     All activities, projects and other expenditures would be approved and authorized by a&#13;
high powered Ministerial council. Urgent relief activities will be approved by the Chief&#13;
Coordinator (currently the defense minister, as the nominee o f the president) o f the disaster task&#13;
force, which groups all senior bureaucrats including decision makers under one roof and&#13;
coordinates the relief efforts by donors and NGOs. Detailed appraisal processing and monitoring&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
and evaluation criteria are specified in the Operations Manual. The arrangements will be built&#13;
around existing country systems to the extent possible, with upgrades designed to improve&#13;
effectiveness and accountability. At the outset, the donors are expected to harmonize and&#13;
coordinate: overall TRRF priorities, project evaluation criteria, sector-specific operations,&#13;
payment mechanisms, initial funding amounts and replenishment schedules, and reporting&#13;
requirements.&#13;
&#13;
Currentflow of funds and other arrangements&#13;
&#13;
32.      A Bank Account for the TRRF, managed by MoFT, has been set up with the Maldives&#13;
Monetary Authority (MMA; the Central Bank o f Maldives), to receive funds from various&#13;
domestic sources for the tsunami disaster.       Checks and cash received locally are deposited&#13;
directly into this Bank Account. Up to now, the G o M has been meeting relief and reconstruction&#13;
expenses including the operational expenditures from an initial amount made available from the&#13;
budget (approximately Rf.82 million or US$6.4 million have been spent till February 5, 2005).&#13;
Another two Bank accounts have been opened with the Bank o f Maldives (BoM) to receive&#13;
international contributions, one account for Rufiyaa contributions and another account for foreign&#13;
exchange. Total cash receipts and commitments o f US$25.45 million and o f Rf.16.892 million&#13;
had been received by the TRRF up untilFebruary 6,2005, amounting to a total o f US$27 million.&#13;
It is proposed to transfer all the amounts from B o M to the bank account at MMA, in line with&#13;
other government departments and agencies for the purposes o f spending on the p r ~ g r a m . ~&#13;
Separate records are being maintained for aid received in-hnd. The inventory list o f supplies&#13;
received and supplies made i s being periodically updated. Adequate physical and administrative&#13;
controls are being maintained over these by the National Security Service (NSS)6, by way o f&#13;
maintaining intake registers, periodic inventory counts, requisition slips, release slips, segregation&#13;
of duties etc. The initial accounts for the TRRF are being inspected by the Auditor General who i s&#13;
also helping in setting up the FM arrangements for the fund. MoFT is in the process o f revising&#13;
its budget for the current year (calendar year 2005) to include the TRRF related expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
Strengths and weaknesses of thefinancial management system&#13;
&#13;
     (i)     A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) camed out in late 2000&#13;
             concluded that although public financial management and accountability inMaldives&#13;
             i s at a nascent stage, there i s an understanding and commitment within the&#13;
             Government to modernize in this area. Important steps have already begun to reform&#13;
             public financial management arrangements.&#13;
     (ii)    The government o f Maldives has prior experience in handling IDA-financedprojects&#13;
             with satisfactory FMarrangements.&#13;
     (iii)   The TRRF i s in the process o f establishing a sound financial management system&#13;
             incorporating financial arrangements, control processes, and funds flow arrangements&#13;
             based upon the best government practices currently inuse and with the possibility o f&#13;
             tailoring them to more closely meet the needs o f tsunami recovery operations.&#13;
     (iv)    Fund flows will be routed through the government budget and will facilitate&#13;
             integration with government finances, allow budgeting, and enable accurate tracking&#13;
             o f expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  As per GoM financial rules, the departments are allowed to spend only from bank accounts kept at the&#13;
central bank (MMA).&#13;
  NSS has beenmandated to monitor &amp; control the movement o f in-kindaid by controlling the warehousing&#13;
and transportation arrangement.&#13;

33.      The TRRF Board, led by the Auditor General, includes three private sector&#13;
representatives and a joint representative o f the international donor agencies. The Board will&#13;
provide overall oversight and strategic direction to the fund. In addition the day to day&#13;
management o f the fund would be entrusted to the government accounting bureau at MoFT. This&#13;
team will be headed by Financial Controller and would consist of a chief accountant (accounts&#13;
payable) and other senior personnel from procurement, revenue, banking, accounting,&#13;
warehousing, inventory management, IT and internal audit. Technical inputs, follow up and&#13;
supervision would be provided by the designated personnel o f the line ministries. The Financial&#13;
Controller, who has more than two decades o f experience in MoFT and the financial sector, i s&#13;
already in place. The other members in the Accounting and Finance team include a professional&#13;
accountant with requisite experience with government systems and best practices. Recruitment&#13;
for other staff has begun and i s likely to be complete bythirdweek o f February. Inthe meanwhile&#13;
support i s being provided by other senior functionaries o f MoFT.&#13;
&#13;
Fund Flows under the Bankfinancedproject (IDA Credit and Grant)&#13;
&#13;
34.      Similar to procedures followed in other World Bank financed operations, the Government&#13;
o f Maldives will open a bank account in the name o f TRRF (designated special account, in&#13;
accordance with the requirements) with the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA). This Bank&#13;
account will be administered by the TRRF. An advance aggregating US$5 million to meet the&#13;
anticipated expenditures for the initial four months will be provided by IDA through this bank&#13;
account. All project related payments to suppliers and contractors will be made on a centralized&#13;
basis, directly by the TRRF and later reimbursed from this special account. Replenishments&#13;
would be provided to this Bank account by IDA on the basis o f withdrawal applications&#13;
evidencing the project related expenditures.&#13;

Operations Manual&#13;
&#13;
35.      Government o f Maldives (GoM) i s fully aware o f the importance o f establishing and&#13;
adopting a strong financial management system to account for and monitor the utilization o f&#13;
funds for the emergency through the Fund, and is in this process of preparing an Operations&#13;
Manual which will lay down the ground rules for activity / project evaluation, appraisal and&#13;
approval, procurement, flow o f funds, financial reporting, accounting including accounting for&#13;
intermediarieddepartments, financial reporting standards, and audit arrangements including the&#13;
TOR o f the auditors. This will be based upon existing government financial regulations and will&#13;
attempt to amplify the internal and financial controls that should be established in such a&#13;
situation. In case o f any inconsistency between existing government financial rules and the&#13;
Operations Manual, the latter shall prevail.' Inputs are being provided by various stakeholders&#13;
including the Auditor General, Ministry o f Finance and Treasury and departments coordinating&#13;
the disaster mitigation activities. This manual will serve as a guide to the operating staff in the&#13;
project and a suitable accounting system i s being installed at MoFT to ease preparation o f the&#13;
financial and other reports.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
&#13;
36.      The TRRF will be responsible for funding all project expenditures, accounting for them,&#13;
and reporting on financial and physical progress. The Fund will comply with the applicable&#13;
international accounting standards and policies, which will be captured inthe Operations Manual.&#13;
For this purpose, assistance will be provided by the professional accountants worlung at the&#13;
TRRF.&#13;
&#13;
FMand other information systems&#13;
37.      The TRRF i s in the process o f establishing an adequate financial management system at&#13;
the government accounting bureau in MoFT. This includes documenting and establishing&#13;
financial arrangements, control processes, and funds flow arrangements, based upon the best&#13;
government practices currently in use, with the possibility o f tailoring them to more closely to&#13;
meet the needs o f tsunami recovery operations while ensuring adequate and robust controls.&#13;
Initially, an off-the-shelf accounting software i s beingusedby the Fundwhich will be augmented,&#13;
according to the program requirements during implementation. All required books o f accounts&#13;
will be kept by the TRRF. This accounting system will be voucher based, computerized and&#13;
based on double entry accounting system. This system will be able to generate expenditure&#13;
information along the lines o f the expenditure classification in the government budget, while also&#13;
identifying the fundingsource (donor).&#13;
&#13;
Financia1Reporting&#13;
&#13;
38.      The government departments involved in the supervision and monitoring o f the activities&#13;
to be funded through the TRRF will provide the physical reporting and other documentation, that&#13;
may be required from an accounting and audit perspective, on a monthly basis to the Fund.The&#13;
IDA related reporting requirements and the formats will be spelt out inthe Operations Manual,&#13;
and will include as a minimum the physical and financial information necessary to enable&#13;
progress monitoring. The Fundwill submit quarterly financial monitoring reports (FMRs) to IDA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'For this purpose, the final Operations Manual will be approved at an appropriate level for adoptionby the&#13;
T W .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 14-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
within 45 days o f the end o f the quarter, starting from the end o f the first calendar quarter after&#13;
effectiveness. The Operations Manual will provide details on the reporting mechanisms that&#13;
should be adopted by the project.&#13;
&#13;
I nterna1 Controls&#13;
&#13;
39.     The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) o f Maldives concluded that&#13;
basic controls over budgeting, disbursements, receipts, accounting, and reporting are in place.&#13;
Key aspects include controls over the operation o f bank accounts, a budget appropriation and&#13;
release process overseen by MoFT, requirements for basic accounting records, certification and&#13;
authorization controls over Govemment payroll and other expenditures, and preparation o f&#13;
monthly accountingreports for MoFT. Special attention will be paid to distribution o f cash grants&#13;
to the beneficiaries, which carries an inherent fiduciary risk, which will be mitigated by&#13;
implementing a designthat uses existing govemment controls &amp; systems, i s fully transparent, and&#13;
ensures adequate community and local government involvement. The Govemment Financial&#13;
Regulations Act, last consolidated in 1992, set out the requirements for the intemal controls and&#13;
recording o f public revenue; government expenditure including payroll; government assets&#13;
including cash in custody, property and equipment, consumable items and items printed for sale;&#13;
procurement and contract management. These Regulations reflect the manual accounting systems&#13;
o f the Govemment and are in the process o f being updated as part o f the modernization and&#13;
computerization o f the public accounting system. Additional internal control procedures will be&#13;
specified in the Operations Manual to bridge any gaps and to promote outcome/output focused&#13;
accountability.&#13;
&#13;
40.     Internal Audit. In addition to the regular financial statement audit, the TRRF will be&#13;
subjected to a regular internal audit by a firm o f intemational chartered accountants, approved by&#13;
the Office o f Auditor General o f Maldives, to assess whether the funds have been disbursed on a&#13;
timely basis, reached the intended recipients, transactional controls and propriety has been&#13;
maintained and used effectively and efficiently for the intended purposes. Intemal audit terms o f&#13;
reference will be detailed in the Operations Manual. This process will result in periodic: (i)&#13;
performance audit with identification o f recommendations for enhanced accountability and&#13;
transparency, and (ii)  timely corrective actions by the Fund and its implementing agencies.&#13;
Selection process for the intemal auditors has begun and they are expected to be inplace by end&#13;
February. The audit will begin inMarchand first reports are expected by the middle of April. The&#13;
intemal audit reports will be shared with IDA periodically, at request.&#13;
&#13;
41.     External Audit. The Fund, as per the decree issued by the president, is required to be&#13;
audited by an intemational firm o f accountants, acceptable to IDA, under international standards&#13;
of auditing to maintain full transparency and provide adequate assurance to all the stakeholders.&#13;
The audit firm will be nominated by the TRR monitoring Board which includes various&#13;
stakeholders including donors. The terms o f reference for the extemal audit will be included in&#13;
the Operations Manual, which would include an audit o f the Fund's financial statements. This&#13;
would also be used for receiving fiduciary assurance, as the financial statements o f the overall&#13;
fund would identify the activities specifically agreed to be financed by IDA. The external audits&#13;
would be conducted every six months inthe first year o f the implementation due to the highlevel&#13;
of expected expenditures. Thereafter the audit o f the Fundwould be done on an annual basis.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
44.      Project funds will be disbursed by IDA on the basis o f periodic financial monitoring&#13;
reports (FMR), incorporating financial &amp; physical progress reports in agreed formats, submitted&#13;
by the project on a quarterly basis. Supporting documentation, including completion reports and&#13;
certificates, will be retained by the TRRF and made available to the Bank during project&#13;
supervision. This will need to be coordinated by the TRRF and MoFT. The FMRs and the&#13;
withdrawal application will be prepared by the TRRF and forwarded to M o F T for approval. The&#13;
Fund, in turn, will receive physical progress and other technical reports submitted by the&#13;
departments and other implementing agencies (including local governments) and submit&#13;
withdrawal applications directly to IDA for replenishment of the SDAs. Donors will agree to&#13;
standardized reporting.&#13;
&#13;
45.      Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing will cover the payments already made. The&#13;
total amount o f retroactive financing allowed i s 40 percent o f the combined loan and grant which&#13;
adds up to US$5.6 million. This would include the expenditures made after the date o f the&#13;
tsunami disaster and within 4 months o f the expected loan signing date. It is expected that about&#13;
US$4 million o f the retroactive financing will be used to cover the safety net payments already&#13;
made by the Government duringJanuary. The remaining part o f the retroactive financing will be&#13;
for other programs mostly in education. The expenditure must be backed by adequate&#13;
documentation including evidence ofpayment.&#13;
&#13;
46.      Special Account advance. IDA will advance a sum required to meet anticipated&#13;
expenditures for the next 2 quarters, through the special account opened by the borrower at the&#13;
central bank, MMA.&#13;

Impact of Procurement arrangements&#13;
&#13;
47.     The procurement under the project would largely be centralized at M o F T and would&#13;
require the finance officials o f the fund to closely liaise with them.&#13;
&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
&#13;
48.     This project will require intensive supervision inthe initial year to ensure that satisfactory&#13;
arrangements are being put inplace for financial accountability and adequate usage o f funds.&#13;
&#13;
Conditionsfor effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
49.     Preparation o f an Operations Manual detailing adequate financial management&#13;
arrangements as described above.&#13;
&#13;
G. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
50.      General. IDA intends to support the Government o f Maldive's program of tsunami&#13;
related rehabilitation and reconstruction and would initially focus on (i)    livelihood support, (ii)&#13;
education, and (iii)implementation capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
51.      T W . G o M has setup a "Tsunami Relief and Reconstruction Fund" (TRRF) under the&#13;
aegis o f the MoFT. The fund would be operated by the MoFT using regular staff and the&#13;
oversight will be provided by TRRF monitoring board appointed by the President. TRRF&#13;
monitoring board i s chaired by Auditor General and includes representation from both the public&#13;
sector, the private sector, and the donors. Activities proposed by agencies need to obtain the&#13;
approval o f the Ministerial council to be eligible for financing under TREV.&#13;
&#13;
52.     Procurement Rules. Procurement actions by all the beneficiarieso f the proposedprogram&#13;
would be carried out in accordance with the procedures in TRRF Operations Manual. The&#13;
procedures will largely be based on the current Financial Regulations o f the G o M and&#13;
international procurement practices. The proposed manual shall include information such as&#13;
detailed procurement rules, methods, use o f SBDsRFPs, appeal mechanism, blacklisting&#13;
mechanism for suppliers/contractors, technical guidance notes etc. The proposed manual will be&#13;
finalized and agreed by IDA prior to the disbursement o f first tranche o f funds.&#13;
&#13;
53.      Procurement Responsibility. MoFT shall take the overall responsibility for all&#13;
Procurement actions under the TRRF. However Procurement o f goods, works and services and&#13;
disbursement o f grants for livelihood support activities shall be implemented either by M o F T or&#13;
any other agency identified by MoFT.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity Review and Risk assessment&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Rules of the Government of Maldives&#13;
&#13;
 54.     Legal and Procedural Framework: (a) Procurement of works, goods and consulting&#13;
services:&#13;
&#13;
     (i)     Procurement of works and goods: Government Financial Regulations (FR)                   -&#13;
             Chapter 6, details the thresholds and steps to be followed in procurement o f works.&#13;
             The findings are as follows: All works contracts estimated to cost more than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 17-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             Rf.10,000 - 500,000 (US$800 - 40,000) could be handled by the executing agency&#13;
             (EA) and need to be advertised. Bids will have to be re-invited if less than three&#13;
             biddquotations are received.&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)     Bidding and evaluation for all contracts above Rf.500,000 (US$40,000) will be&#13;
             handled by the Tender Evaluation Board (TEB) constituted under the Ministry o f&#13;
             Finance and Treasury (MoFT) and awarded by the line Ministry. This TEB was&#13;
             formerly constituted under the Ministry o f Construction and Public Works, now re-&#13;
             named as Ministry o f Environment and construction. A pre-qualification procedure&#13;
             has to be followed for all contracts estimated to cost more than Rf.5,000,000&#13;
             (US$400,000) and for complex contracts.&#13;
&#13;
55.     FR lists the steps required to be taken, makes references to the bidding process, and&#13;
always requests a public bid opening with representation o f bidders and opening o f bids&#13;
immediately after submission. FR lists out key conditions to be included in the conditions o f&#13;
contract: duration of contract, liquidated damages and rate, retention money, dispute resolution&#13;
mechanism and remedies against performance and default, and advance payment. However, FR&#13;
does not guide on the time that shouldbe allowed for preparation o f bids, but it i s the established&#13;
practice to allow about one month for bids invited from national firms following Local&#13;
Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures and upto three months for contracts following&#13;
International Competitive procedures. G o M does not restrict any foreign participation as a joint&#13;
venture partner for LCB, but requests the joint venture partner to register the company in&#13;
Maldives upon selection as the winning bidder for the duration o fthe contract.&#13;
&#13;
56.     G o M does not canyout price negotiations with the winningbidder.&#13;
&#13;
57.     According to FR, TEB i s responsible for monitoring the progress of the works including&#13;
certifying the progress bills. Inaddition, TEB i s nominated to handle contractual disputes. This&#13;
practice could be seen as a potential conflict o f interest.&#13;
&#13;
58.     Guidelines. The then the Ministry o f Construction and Public Works issued         " Tender&#13;
Guidelines for Govemment Projects" in December 2001. This document includes a circular and&#13;
six annexes as described below: Annex 1- Consultant's Selection for Govemment Projects;&#13;
Annex 2 - Pre qualification information sheet; Annex 3 -Pre qualification document; Annex 4 -&#13;
Tender and Contract Document (Part I); 5 - Tender and Contract Document (Part 11);&#13;
                                            Annex&#13;
Annex 6 Tender Board procedures for Local Competitive bidding. The pre-qualification and&#13;
tender documents are based on the World Bank's standard pre qualification and bidding&#13;
documents for procurement o f small works. Circular on selection o f consultants does not detail&#13;
the steps or the method. There i s guidance that proposals shouldbe invited from firms that have at&#13;
least two years experience and that have handled at least one project for G o M and have&#13;
availability o f qualified staff.&#13;
&#13;
59.     Comments about GoMguidelines. The pre-qualificationprocedures follow a point system&#13;
for qualifying the bidders but does not disclose the distribution o f points upfront. The documents&#13;
request the bidders to propose the time for completion rather than indicating the intended&#13;
completion period in advance. It was also noted that M o F T has recently prepared a document for&#13;
supply and installation o f goods based on Bank's SBD Goods. Inaddition they have prepared&#13;
documents and invited bids for award o f contracts on the basis of supplier's credit. FR has n o&#13;
detailed steps for theprocurement ofgoods but covered little under 6.13 and 6.17. Itmay because&#13;
it has mandatedprocurement o f goods from State Trading Organization (STO) (FR6.17 (a)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                             - 1 8 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60.      Upon request from government departments or ministries, the STO handles procurement&#13;
of various items including medical drugs and surgical equipment and consumables. Usually STO&#13;
follows shopping procedures for such procurement from their database o f registered suppliers.&#13;
The registrationprocedure i s open for any organization and round the year.&#13;
&#13;
61.      (b) Selection of Consultants: There are no provisions inthe FR.However circular giving&#13;
a very brief note has been prepared by MCPW in December 2001 for selection o f consultants for&#13;
civil works.&#13;
&#13;
62.      (e) Publication of awards: MoFT has commenced publishing in the local newspapers a&#13;
list of winning bidders and contracts on a monthly basis begmning from November 2004.&#13;
&#13;
63.      (d) Appealskhallenges mechanismfor contract award determination: The only system&#13;
available i s to appeal to the Anti corruption Board.&#13;
&#13;
64.      (e)Suspension/blacklisting    of  contractorshppliers: G o M has blacklisted several&#13;
contractors despite a lack o f formal mechanism for doing so.&#13;
&#13;
65.      fl Anti corruption measures:The        Anti Corruption Board (ACB) established under a&#13;
Presidential Directive in 1991 1s active. The ACB receives around 60 complaints annually,&#13;
including complaints from suppliers and contractors. Ifneeded, the Board o f ACB can request the&#13;
procuring entities to hold decisions until the complaint has been investigated. Most o f the&#13;
complaints are finalized within two months period and depending on the outcome o f the findings&#13;
the complaints are either referred to: (a) Attorney General for prosecution; (b) imposing fines; or&#13;
(c) recommendedto be dropped as found baseless.&#13;
&#13;
66.      (g) Procurement Procedures for activitiesfinanced by Foreign Financing Institutions:&#13;
According to our understanding o f paragraph 6.11 (f) o f Government Financial Regulations, the&#13;
implementing agency may carryout all the procurement actions if financed by foreign funding&#13;
agencies by a coordinating committee appointed with the approval o f the President's Office&#13;
following procedures agreed with the Financing Institution. IDA agrees for national procedures&#13;
with a list o f "Improved BiddingProcedures" for NCB works contracts.&#13;
&#13;
Recommended Actions for Improving the Procurement Capacity of the Implementing Agencies&#13;
&#13;
67.      Based on the review o f GoM's procurement regulations and practices described above, it&#13;
i s recommended that the G o M review and revise the existing Procurement Guidelines in the&#13;
Financial Regulations to bring them in line with good international public procurement practices.&#13;
This will include provisions for dispute resolutionand suspension andblacklistingprocedure.&#13;
&#13;
68.      IDA could seek the possibility o f processing a IDF grant to carryout the proposed&#13;
improvement and capacity buildingactivities to improve the current procurement environment.&#13;

environmental and social risk management; (ii)  tools to screen subprojects for environmental and&#13;
social impacts and mitigate such impacts; (iii)procedures to ensure that these principles and tools&#13;
are appropriately applied; and (iv) guidelines for capacity building and monitoring. The&#13;

&#13;
I. Objectives&#13;
&#13;
1.      The Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF)&#13;
details general policies, guidelines,         and procedures to be integrated into the&#13;
implementation o f the IDA supported Post-Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction&#13;
Project in the Maldives. The project aims to support the efforts o f the Government o f&#13;
Maldives to address immediate post-tsunami needs and to start the reconstruction&#13;
process. This operation will be implemented over a period o f three years but much o f the&#13;
work i s expected to be completed during the first year. The project has been prepared in&#13;
accordance with the World Bank's OP 8.50, Emergency Recovery Assistance, to expedite&#13;
processing and provide immediate support through a proposed grant o f $5.6 million and&#13;
a credit o f $8.4 million focusing on: (i)   restoration of livelihoods through safety net cash&#13;
transfers to the affected and a program to restore lost or damaged assets; (ii)        increased&#13;
school capacity, including additional schools and facilities, on islands receiving&#13;
populations permanently displaced by the tsunami; and (iii)technical skills for&#13;
implementingthe post-tsunami reconstructionprogram.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The ESSAF has been developed to ensure compliance with the World Bank's&#13;
safeguard policies and i s applicable to all subprojects funded under the project. The&#13;
objective o f the ESSAF i s to ensure that activities under the proposed reconstruction&#13;
operations will address the following:&#13;
                Enhancepositive and sustainable environmental and socialoutcomes;&#13;
                Support the integration of environmental and social aspects of subprojects into&#13;
                the decisionmaking process;&#13;
                Ensure environmentally and sustainable development by supporting the&#13;
                protection, conservation, maintenance and rehabilitation of natural habitats and&#13;
                their functions;&#13;
                Minimize environmental degradation as a result of either individual subprojects&#13;
                or their cumulative effects;&#13;
                Protecthumanhealth;&#13;
                Minimize impacts on cultural property; and&#13;
                Assist displaced people in improving or at least restoring their livelihoods and&#13;
                standards of living to pre-displacementlevels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.     GeneralPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
3.      Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed relief and reconstruction operations&#13;
and the related need for providing immediate assistance, while at the same time ensuring due&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
diligence in managing potential environmental and social risks, the ESSAF i s based on the&#13;
following principles:&#13;
&#13;
        The proposed operations will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs o f which&#13;
        may not be known at appraisal. To ensure effective application o f the World Bank's&#13;
        safeguard policies, the ESSAF provides guidance on the approach to be taken during&#13;
        implementation for the selection and design o f subprojects and the planning o f mitigation&#13;
        measures;&#13;
        Environmental category `A' subprojects are not expected in the first year's subprojects.&#13;
        If any do occur, EAs for specific subprojects will be prepared during implementation,&#13;
        instead o f before appraisal and are subject to approval by the World Bank. Corrective&#13;
        measures in the form o f an Environmental Management Plan will be built into either the&#13;
        emergency project or a future lending operation. The above i s in accordance with&#13;
        paragraph 13 o f OP 4.01 and paragraph 5 o f BP 4.01 on emergency recovery assistance;&#13;
        The overall aim o f the proposed operations i s to ensure the sustainable restoration o f the&#13;
        habitats and livelihoods o f populations displaced or affected by the tsunami. The&#13;
        overarching principles o f the World Bank's social safeguard policies are instructive on&#13;
        the use o f systematic and cost effective mechanisms to achieve this objective. These&#13;
        include: (i)  consultations with affected people inthe preparation o f relocation plans and&#13;
        ensuringthat their views and concerns are made known to decisionmakers and taken into&#13;
        account; (ii)  socio-economic surveys to identify and assess social impacts, including loss&#13;
        o f assets, income source or livelihoods; (iii)disclosure o f relocation plans to the affected&#13;
        population and dissemination o f information on their rights and measures to improve or&#13;
        restore their livelihoods; and (iv) strategies to ensure that benefits are also provided to&#13;
        host communities, where applicable. Since a major element in the recent World Bank&#13;
        strategy to support the Maldives has been to support the population consolidation policy&#13;
        as protection against rising sea-levels and to improve public services, it would be good&#13;
        practice for the Govemment to adopt these policy principles. The adoption o f these&#13;
        principles would contribute to institutionalizing good practice and facilitate more&#13;
        effective and participatory implementation o f the Govemment's own relocationpolicy, as&#13;
        well as facilitate the preparation o f donor projects. It would also be good practice for the&#13;
        Govemment to undertake social assessments detailing social impacts and measures to&#13;
        mitigate these impacts, as well as present planning documents which include the&#13;
        outcomes o f consultations with affected communities;&#13;
        Inthe unlikely event that people are physically or economically affectedbyBank funded&#13;
        subprojects, appropriate social studies, in accordance with the requirements o f OP 4.12&#13;
        will be prepared. These studies can be prepared during implementation, providing a&#13;
        timetable for their preparation duringimplementationi s agreed with IDA at appraisal.&#13;
        The proposed emergency reconstruction operations will finance feasibility and detailed&#13;
        design studies for these subsequent investments, which will include environmental&#13;
        assessments and social studies as required by World Bank safeguard policies;&#13;
        Employment opportunities within the projects will be available on an equal basis to all,&#13;
        on the basis o f professional competence, irrespective o f gender. In all projects which&#13;
        require consultations with local communities or beneficiaries, consultations will be&#13;
        conducted to elicit the views o f the male, female and vulnerable populations; and&#13;
        Consultation and disclosure requirements will be adapted to meet the special needs o f&#13;
        these operations. This ESSAF will be disclosed in the sector ministries and other public&#13;
        places inthe Maldives and inthe World Bank Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
111.     Environmental and Social Screeningand Assessment Framework (ESSAF)&#13;
&#13;
4.       This ESSAF has been developed specifically for these proposed operations (Section 1.1,&#13;
above) to ensure due diligence and to avoid causing harm to the environment or exacerbating&#13;
social tensions. The purpose o f this Framework i s also to assist the Project Implementing&#13;
Agencies in screening all the subprojects for their likely social and environmental impacts,&#13;
identify documentation and prepare requirements, and prioritizing the investments.&#13;
&#13;
5.       OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment. Most o f the proposed subprojects are likely to&#13;
focus on the restoration o f livelihoods, education services and technical skills for implementing&#13;
the post-tsunami reconstruction. While work inthese areas will be done under OP 4.01, OP 4.04&#13;
onnatural habitatsmay also be triggered.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Considering the nature and magnitude o f potential environmental impacts from relatively&#13;
limited scale and magnitude o f reconstruction works, the proposed operations are likely to be&#13;
classified as category `B'. The requirement to carry out an Environmental Analysis as part o f&#13;
project preparation can be waived, but for subprojects with possible adverse impacts, a limited&#13;
Environmental Analysis will be prepared after approval and before implementation o f the&#13;
respective subprojects. To address specific issues, prior to appraisal the implementing agency&#13;
will agree to apply the following minimum standards during implementation: inclusion o f&#13;
standard environmental codes o f practice (ECOP) inthe repair and reconstructionbid documents&#13;
of all subprojects; review and oversight o f any major reconstruction works by specialists;&#13;
implementation o f environmentally and socially sound options for disposal o f debris; and&#13;
provisions for adequate budget and satisfactory institutional arrangements for monitoring&#13;
effective implementation.&#13;
&#13;
7.       OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement.        The need for involuntary resettlement is highly&#13;
unlikely and will only be known when site-specific plans are available. Subprojects will be&#13;
screened for applicability o f the resettlement policy. In the event that people are physically or&#13;
economically displaced by Bank funded subprojects, IDA will, in applicable circumstances,&#13;
require a draft resettlement plan prepared inaccordance with the requirements o f OP 4.12, before&#13;
the commencement o f any relocation activities. This plan i s subject to the approval o f IDA.&#13;
&#13;
8.       OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples. The five defining characteristics normally used (OD 4.20,&#13;
paragraph 5) to identify indigenous peoples are not applicable in the Maldivian context. The&#13;
policy does not apply, nevertheless, a potential vulnerability assessment o f all affected groups is&#13;
planned to ensure effective consultations and definition o f appropriate benefits.&#13;
&#13;
9.        OPN 11.03 Cultural Property. The emergency operation may pose limited risks o f&#13;
damaging cultural property, assuming that they will not include large-scale excavations,&#13;
movement o f earth or demolition. Nevertheless, projects and subprojects will be reviewed for&#13;
their potential impact on cultural property and clear procedures will be required for identification,&#13;
protection o f cultural property from theft, and treatment o f discovered artifacts, and will be&#13;
included in standard bidding documents.       While not damaging cultural property, subproject&#13;
preparation may later identify and include assistance for preservation o f historic or archeological&#13;
sites. If these opportunities occur, cultural property management plans would be prepared for&#13;
those subprojects in compliance with OPN 11.30 and local laws and regulations.&#13;
&#13;
 10.     OP4.04 NaturalHabitats.          The Maldives can be considered as a sensitive&#13;
ecosystem, endowed with large tracts o f environmentally sensitive natural habitats. Conservation&#13;
of such habitats during reconstruction i s essential. Although a detailed survey has not yet been&#13;
undertaken, based on the experience o f other tsunami affected countries, areas where natural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
resources such as mangroves, sand dunes and reefs were degraded or destroyed most likely&#13;
suffered more from the tsunami compared to areas where the natural barriers were intact. This&#13;
underlies the importance o f conserving natural habitats. Since the World Bank will not support&#13;
subprojects that involve conversiono f critical natural habitats an EA i s required prior to initiation&#13;
of any specific subproject that could possibly affect the conversion o f natural habitats. Decisions&#13;
on actions and requirements will be made with the concurrence o fthe Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV.     Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
11.     Subproject selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation will be consistent&#13;
with the following guidelines, codes o f practice and requirements. The safeguard screening and&#13;
mitigation process will include:&#13;
&#13;
        *:*  A list o fineligible subprojects listedinAttachment 1;&#13;
        *:*  A proposed checklist of likely environment and social impacts to be filled out for&#13;
             each subproject or group o f subprojects, Attachment 2;&#13;
        *3 Guidelines for asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation, Attachment 3;&#13;
        *:*  Overall guidelines for environment and social aspects o f the Tsunami Emergency&#13;
             Recovery Program as well as procedures for the protection of cultural property,&#13;
             including the chance discovery o f archaeological artifacts, unrecorded graveyards&#13;
             and burial sites, Attachment 4;&#13;
        *:*  Relevant elements o f the codes o f practice for the prevention and mitigation o f&#13;
             potential environmentalimpacts, Attachment 5;&#13;
        *:*  Recommended Environmental Codes o f Practice, Attachment 6; and&#13;
        *3 A sample Environmental Safeguards procedures for Inclusion in the Technical&#13;
             Specifications o f Contracts, Attachment 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
V.      Responsibilitiesfor Safeguard Screening, Mitigation and Clearance&#13;
&#13;
12.     All project supported activities and other expenditures would be approved and authorized&#13;
by a high powered Ministerial Council. Urgent relief activities will be approved by the Chief&#13;
Coordinator o f the disaster task force which groups all senior bureaucrats including decision&#13;
makers under one roof and coordinates the relief efforts by donors and NGOs. A s a policy, the&#13;
disaster task force will require the ESSAF to be adopted by all implementing agencies. This&#13;
authority will ensure that all reconstruction activities that will be implemented by sub-national&#13;
agencies adhere to the requirements o f the ESSAF, and that designated environment and social&#13;
development specialists are appointed for overseeing the implementation and monitoring o f the&#13;
Framework.       A focal person will be appointed for oversight on required environmental&#13;
clearances and approval o f required environment and social studies. The World Bank will assign&#13;
specialists to facilitate the implementation o f the ESSAF and provide approval of environmental&#13;
and social assessmendstudies requiring Bank clearance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VI.     Capacity-Building and Monitoring of Safeguard FrameworkImplementation&#13;
&#13;
13.     As part o f the capacity-building to be provided for implementation o f the proposed&#13;
operations, the designated environment and social development specialists worlung with the task&#13;
force as well as relevant staff o f the concerned Ministries and implementing agencies will receive&#13;
training in ESSAF's application. During supervision o f these operations, the World Bank will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assess the implementation o f the ESSAF, andrecommend additional strengthening, ifrequired. A&#13;
comprehensive review o f ESSAF's application will be undertaken by the World Bank 18 months&#13;
after project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VII. ConsultationandDisclosure&#13;
&#13;
14.      This ESSAF will be shared by the Government o f Maldives, with concerned&#13;
nongovernmental organizations and development partners o f Maldives reconstruction. It will be&#13;
disclosed in Dhivehi and Englishby the Ministry o f Planning and National Development and it&#13;
will also be made available at the World Bank's Infoshop. Relevant subproject specific safeguard&#13;
documentdmitigation plansprepared subsequently will also be disclosed.&#13;
&#13;
15.      The proposed operations may support a number o f feasibility and detailed design studies&#13;
for future infrastructure investments for which World Bank safeguard policies relating to&#13;
consultation and disclosure will apply.      In particular, for environmental Category A and B&#13;
investments' proposed for future operations, the implementing agency will consult project-&#13;
affected groups and local nongovernmental organizations on the project's environmental and&#13;
social aspects, and will take their views into account. The implementing agency will initiate&#13;
these consultations as early as possible, and for meaningful consultations, will provide relevant&#13;
material in a timely manner prior to consultation, in a form and language(s) that are&#13;
understandable and accessible to the groups being consulted.&#13;
&#13;
16.      For Category A projects, the implementing agency will consult these groups at least&#13;
twice: (a) shortly after the environmental screening and prior to finalization o f the terms o f&#13;
reference for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA); and (b) once a draft EL4 report i s&#13;
prepared. For the initial consultation, the implementing agency will provide a summary o f the&#13;
proposed project's objectives, description, and potential impacts. For both Category A and B&#13;
projects, the implementing agency will provide these groups with a summary o f the EL4report's&#13;
conclusions. Inaddition, the implementing agency will make the draft reports publicly available&#13;
to project-affectedgroups and local nongovemmental organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VIII. Guidelinesfor preparationofEnvironmentalManagementPlans&#13;
&#13;
17.      Having identified the potential impacts o f the relevant sub-component, the next step o f&#13;
the EA process involves the identification and development o f measures aimed at eliminating,&#13;
offsetting and/or reducing impacts to levels that are environmentally acceptable during&#13;
implementation and operation o f the project (EMP). EMPs provide an essential link between the&#13;
impacts predicted and mitigation measures specified within the EA and implementation and&#13;
operation activities. World Bank guidelines state that detailed EMPs are essential elements for&#13;
Category A projects, but for many Category B projects, a simple EMP alone will suffice. While&#13;
there are no standard formats for EMPs, it i s recognized that the format needs to fit the&#13;
circumstances inwhich the EMP i s being developed and the requirements, which it i s designed to&#13;
meet. EMPs should be prepared after talung into account comments from both the PAA and IDA&#13;
as well as any clearance conditions. Given below are the important elements that constitute an&#13;
EMP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
* As defined inWorld Bank Operational Policy 4.01, Environmental Assessment.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
a. Description of mitigation measures&#13;
18.      Feasible and cost effective measures to minimize adverse impacts to acceptable levels&#13;
should be specified with reference to each impact identified. Further, it should provide details on&#13;
the conditions under which the mitigation measure should be implemented (e.g., routine or inthe&#13;
event o f contingencies). The EMP also should distinguish between type o f solution proposed&#13;
(structural &amp; non-structural) and the phase in which it should become operable (design,&#13;
construction and/or operational). Efforts should also be made to mainstream environmental and&#13;
social opportunities as reasonable.&#13;
&#13;
b. Monitoringprogram&#13;
19.      Inorder to ensure that the proposed mitigatory measures have the intended results and&#13;
complies with national standards and donor requirements, an environmental performance&#13;
monitoring program should be included inthe EMP. The monitoring program should give details&#13;
o f the following;&#13;
&#13;
          *:* Monitoring indicators to be measured for evaluating the performance o f each&#13;
              mitigatory measure (for example national standards, engineering structures, extent o f&#13;
              area replanted, etc).&#13;
          *:* Monitoringmechanisms and methodologies&#13;
&#13;
          *:e Monitoring frequency&#13;
          *3 Monitoringlocations&#13;
&#13;
c. Institutional arrangements&#13;
20.      Institutiodparties responsible for implementing mitigation measures and for monitoring&#13;
their performance should be clearly identified. Where necessary, mechanisms for institutional co-&#13;
ordination should be identified as often monitoring tends to involve more than one institution.&#13;
&#13;
d. Implementing schedules&#13;
21.      Timing, frequency and duration o f mitigation measures with links to overall&#13;
implementation schedule o f the project should be specified.&#13;
&#13;
e. Reportingprocedures&#13;
22.      Feedback mechanisms to inform the relevant parties on the progress and effectiveness o f&#13;
the mitigation measures and monitoring itself should be specified. Guidelines on the type of&#13;
information wanted and the presentation o f feedback information should also be highlighted.&#13;
&#13;
J: Cost estimates and sources of funds&#13;
23.       Implementation o f mitigation measures mentioned in the EMP will involve an initial&#13;
investment cost as well as recurrent costs. The EMP should include costs estimates for each&#13;
measure and also identify sources o f funding.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Post-Tsunami
            Recovery and Reconstruction Project for Maldives is to
            support the efforts of the Government of the Maldives to
            carry out a program of rehabilitation and reconstruction
            related to the damages caused by the tsunami of December 26,
            2004. This operation will be implemented over a period of
            three years, with much of the work expected to be completed
            during the first year. IDA support will be routed through
            the Tsunami Relief and Reconstruction Fund (TRRF)
            established under the aegis of the Ministry of Finance and
            Treasury with the purpose to assure transparency in the use
            of funds. The operation will have the following components:
            Restoration of livelihoods; Increase school capacity on
            islands receiving the population displaced by the Tsunami;
            and Implementation Support to the Post-tsunami
            Reconstruction Program.
