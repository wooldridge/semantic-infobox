COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT&#13;
relating to&#13;
Global Inlrastructure Facility Partnership Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is en:ered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN (the "Government of Japan"), acting through its Ministr:&#13;
Finance; and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIR E I r&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, Uc ' , he&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvar 1I&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("MIGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, D(  133,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad internationa recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Inter it nal&#13;
Organizations (lOs), the G77, and the private sector represented by the B20 that investin Ir the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to 3.: 3nd&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic c r: th&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on   i :ing&#13;
sources of infrastructure fina,ice-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and cooi dr ted&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize private sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robust pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects ani I It 3 is&#13;
understood to be the greates: barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investm .!i it&#13;
(D) Governments, development finance institutions, donors, and private investors share an in e-0 t in&#13;
developing the market for private infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand sc , in&#13;
the numbers of structurally sound and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual em !r, ice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range o 1r ate&#13;
investors that actively participate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals wil I h efit&#13;
from collective action between this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowl: !I to&#13;
find  solutions  to  complex  i-frastructure  financing  challenges  that no  single  instit:utio  (: uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global InfrastructurE FE ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF") The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at levera i'(: the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of i,stitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruct ie vith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prer s  on,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigation for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard, [e  31F&#13;
aims to complement existing and proposed services and initiatives currently supportec :, the&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prep, r tell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure projects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces -i 1C the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro , F tive&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater I :E 3ge&#13;
of official resources in the face of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular 1. rge&#13;
and complex projects with the potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interested in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure it ility&#13;
Partnership Program, together with other partners.&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have come. to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facility Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended to be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set o i i&#13;
Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the 31F Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their collalc r: ion,&#13;
they are of an indicative natu,e and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties and v'i&#13;
other potential partners until Ihe GIF is formally established. The final version of these objE ci s&#13;
and principles will be agreed ipon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to further enhance their coordination, in particular by developing t  IF,&#13;
with a view to formally establishing the program by December 2014.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1   Pursuant to the foregoing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to continue ti&#13;
collaborate in developing the GIF, including but not limited to:&#13;

e. Any other aspects of collaboration required to finalize the design of the GIF, incluc r g&#13;
sharing best practice and experience with regard to project preparation, through tl l L e&#13;
of knowledge platforms for the infrastructure sector.&#13;
2.2   During the process of finalizing the design of the GIF, the multilateral development banl I ted&#13;
in Annex 2 will be invited to participate as initial Technical Partners. Once the GIF dl  i is&#13;
finalized, additional collaboiative efforts are required to develop the operational details I:) the&#13;
GIF, at all times complemnting existing efforts and facilities and building upon the sh: red&#13;
knowledge and experience of the Parties in this area. This includes determining the E%v of&#13;
coordination between the Parties and project origination process.&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the GIF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure pi : ts&#13;
in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparati :1n,&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercia r&#13;
institutional investor engagement in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex public-private partnerships and projects with potential for comimer :i&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastru:;I,&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coorc ir on&#13;
resources in collaboration with the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of th N le&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMD&#13;
infrastructure, with the input and ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagemei t c: uld&#13;
stretch from upstream support on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to dowrstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemerit.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structure.1&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GIF can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset class attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking ong t&#13;
assets in faster growing economies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profilE:;&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to operate according to the following core principles, to be finalizE c L )on&#13;
agreement among GIF partners:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities tit :-I&#13;
draw together comparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing putilic goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly thosE&#13;
infrastructure projects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sustainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to t ie;&#13;
practice standar:s for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing tE :' cal&#13;
and financial resources of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mu :i a: )ral&#13;
development inslitutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in ar&#13;
innovative and flexible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve great(&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that arE&#13;
beyond the resources of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in t&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF p  r rs&#13;
are expected to fall into one or more of the following categories:&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partners-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF wi:&#13;
considered Funding Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partners-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice and support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-funde:&#13;
activities and/or provision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity suppc 1&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partners-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/or institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sovereign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as wE II:&#13;
other multilateral or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure projects, to be invited into discussions related to project prepara ic r&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional investment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Council is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmin)&#13;
management and use of funds, and development of operational policies and procedures; n :1&#13;
hold the GIF Management Ur it (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, with advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The compoi ilic of&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is prop&lt; seI to&#13;
comprise representatives of F unding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Council comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Din cI(&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer of the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facili ':E&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve i:&#13;
sounding board, providing gu dance and support for GIF Management, and in particular wi r&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be administered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicatei  m&#13;
established for this purpose (the GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will ft n:-i &gt;n&#13;
as a coordinating body as projects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mo% l&#13;
toward technical support and financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead in!i[i: al&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implemeitation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partne&#13;
institutions, coordinated by the GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governme rs&#13;
according to specific project requirements and the project origination processes. Compos lii of&#13;
the implementation teams may vary according to the need of individual projects and gove -n ints.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection criteria and processes could be developed to reflect the follo\i ii&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Impact-projects that support the development goals of the GI&#13;
partner institutions;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-proects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities a,i&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-projects that require multiple parties to come together to provid&#13;
structuring, arranging and financial support, and/or projects which require a b  of&#13;
financial instruments; and&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial t al ility,&#13;
leverage public funds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- Eu: 1&#13;
as through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's seirvice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastr.icture investments that have global public good characteristic  ich&#13;
as climate friendly-projects that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisior of&#13;
infrastructure services; and trade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconne t1 y&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of support provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with N 1w&#13;
to complementing the resources and support already available from partner entities and 01is&#13;
funding mechanisms. During the GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following a0 i i: as,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; project definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr  01 ng;&#13;
and legal, regulalory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii)  Project preparation and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PPP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, and design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arranging and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financ !:I&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-including in particular the management of environmental and :a&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastr .ct. -e&#13;
projects in supporting sustainable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements :r&#13;
external implementing entities under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards an( 1 er&#13;
standards and policies, and 6evelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for G I&#13;
Technical Partners who are expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activitie,&#13;
