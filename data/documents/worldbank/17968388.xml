influence by aareeing to lead for certain typea of projecta in a key         intensive work that that required, but it frequently led to such work&#13;

substitutes for one another within individual sectors, like within the       way.     Did it appear early on, before the Bank got into making loans for&#13;

response idea:      that we would relate the volume of lending to the          given the political pressures.    We were working very closely with the&#13;
&#13;
country's economic performance.       We couldn't carry that very far in       Fund during much of this period, getting countries to adopt more&#13;
&#13;
fact, but at least we tried to seek out where we could accomplish              appropriate exchange-rate policies as well as policies in the field of&#13;
&#13;
something by additional lending and having a dialogue with the                 public finance -- with varying degrees of success, to be sure, but&#13;
&#13;
country's officials on particular policy problems (transport, finance,         there was some progress.&#13;
&#13;
public utilities, education, whatever the field it may be) and where                The adoption in Brazil of a flexible exchange-rate-policy would&#13;
&#13;
the country's responsiveness to improving ita policy appeared to be            have been impossible, I think, for the Bank.    I am not saying in all of&#13;
&#13;
improving and where we saw an opportunity to accomplish something over         these cases â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ It is well brought out in the Mason and Asher book:&#13;
&#13;
and above the mere transfer of external resources as such.                     you are dealing with public officials in the countries who are thinking&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Is this something like what in the Fund is called                   the same way, and you are helping them overcome some of the obstacles&#13;
&#13;
"Conditionality."                                                              of putting into effect these policies.    I think it would be impossible&#13;
&#13;
ALTER:    That'~   right.   It is very closely related to that.   It is not    in Brazil then and even today to undertake any significant amount of&#13;
&#13;
formalized to the same extent it is in the Fund.       I think it happened     lending if they had continued with the kind of econoâ&#128;¢ic policies that&#13;
&#13;
in my department for reasons not actually of my choosing but because of        they had prior to 1963-1964.&#13;
&#13;
the external conditions.       We entered into a very close collaboration      OLIVER:   It sounds like there is a presumption that the country that&#13;
&#13;
with the Fund, particularly on exchange-rate matters.       There were         uses exchange controls and baa an overvalued currency, perhaps import&#13;
&#13;
countries during this period where the exchange rate being out of line         controls also, is a country where it is very difficult to tell whether&#13;
&#13;
was a critical defect in economic policy.       These were countries which     a project illustrates that the money is being usefully used or not.&#13;
&#13;
had fairly high rates of inflation.      Hany of them-- not all of them,       ALTER:    I think that is certainly one aspect of it.   We developed in&#13;
&#13;
but many of them -- had very high rates of inflation with fixed                the Bank over a period of time a system of shadow pricing of foreign&#13;
&#13;
exchange rates or very slowly moving exchange-rates.       They just           exchange to help correct that, but in many areas of activity you have&#13;
&#13;
couldn'.t bring their balance-of-payments under control.      Their capacity   to go beyond shadow pricing.   You have to have changes in actual&#13;
&#13;
for administering import controls on any rational basis was very poor.         policies in order to have reasonable prospects in macro-economic terms&#13;

Exports were being sacrificed in many cases.       Some of them tried export   for the balance-of-payments and economic growth of the country.      You&#13;

            Gerald Alter held on July 13, 1985

        <abstracts>
            In July 1985, Gerald Alter was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Dr. Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure
            at the Bank from 1951 to 1978, Mr. Alter worked in the
            following areas: in the economics department as an economist
            (1951-1955); as assistant director for economic staff
            (1955-1958); in the department of operations as assistant
            economic advisor for the western hemisphere (1958-1964); as
            director for the western hemisphere department (1964-1970)
            and the South America department (1970-1972); as vice
            president of the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region
            (1972-1975); and as senior advisor to the senior vice
            president of operations (1975-1978). His transcript concerns
            his responsibility for the preparation of country economic
            reports, sector analysis, policy studies on local
            expenditure financing, proposals for local currency
            requirements. Mr. Alter was the first professional economist
            who became an area department head. He discusses his
            involvement between 1964 and 1968 with colleagues to develop
            a lending approach which progressively became more prevalent
            throughout the World Bank, particularly during the
            presidency of Robert McNamara.
