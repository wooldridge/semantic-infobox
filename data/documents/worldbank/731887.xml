Foreword&#13;
We have redesigned the World Development Indicators to expand its coverage of development&#13;
issues in a new, free-standing format, complemented by a comprehensive database on CD-ROM&#13;
*               and a redesigned World Bank Atlas. This new family of products embodies many aspects of the&#13;
change we are trying to bring about at the World Bank Group.&#13;
.               First, the selection of indicators reflects a broader, more integrated approach to development.&#13;
*                The World Development Indicators starts from the premise that development is about the quality&#13;
of life. It places people and poverty reduction first, at the center of the development agenda where&#13;
they belong. In its five main sections it recognizes the interplay of a wide range of issues: human&#13;
capital development, environmental sustainability, macroeconomic performance, private sector&#13;
development, and the global links that influence the external environment for development.&#13;
Second, the new World Development Indicators is an excellent example of global partnership in&#13;
creating and sharing knowledge and in making knowledge a major force for development--an area&#13;
where I see the World Bank playing an increasingly important rto,4. I would like to thank our part-&#13;
ners in the United Nations family, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization,&#13;
the OECD, the statistical offices of more than 200 economies, and countless others who have&#13;
made this unique product possible. Throughout the volume we have acknowledged their contri-&#13;
butions in order to guide researchers and others seeking information to the many sources on&#13;
which it draws. And because the World Development Indicators draws on the Bank's own cross&#13;
country experience and sectoral knowledge, I am particularly pleased to note the important role&#13;
of the new sectoral networks of Bank staff in the redesign. Their support and that of staff of the&#13;
International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency truly make&#13;
the World Development Indicators a Bank Group product.&#13;
Third, the new World Development Indicators reflects the Bank Group's new emphas.s on devel-&#13;
opment impact and outcomes. I hope that the World Development Indicators will become the prin&#13;
cipal mechanism by which the world measures progress in reducing poverty and in enriching the&#13;
lives of people everywhere. For this to happen, however, all of us-governments, international&#13;
institutions, and the private sector-will have to pay far more attention to the coverage. timeli&#13;
ness, and quality of information about development policies and outcomes. The detailecl techni-&#13;
cal notes that accompany each set of indicators show how much work still lies ahead.&#13;
Finally, the annual World Development Indicators is very much a work in progress. In the spirit of&#13;
the new Bank, its redesign reflects extensive consultation with our clients. And knowing that it&#13;
could be even richer and more comprehensive, we welcome your comments to assist us in mak-&#13;
ing it even more powerful in serving our clients' needs.&#13;

Preface&#13;
Our goal in producing the World Development Indicators is to put useful information about the&#13;
world in the hands of pollcymakers, development specialists, students, and the general public.&#13;
c &gt;                     This new volume-together with Its companion publications, the World Bank Atlas and the Ubrld&#13;
Development Indicators CD-ROM-has been totally redesigned. based on extensive consultation&#13;
with partners inside and outside the World Bank and In close collaboration with the Bank's sec-&#13;
tor specialists and research staff. We have expanded the coverage of the Itbrld Development Indi-&#13;
cators to provide an overview of the main themes of development that are the focus of the World&#13;
Bank's work: the welfare of people, the use and preservation of the environment, the growth and&#13;
structure of the economy, the complementary roles of states and markets, and the growing llnks&#13;
between economies. Guiding our selection of indicators is a desire to present the most useful&#13;
.            |              and Interesting information available on trends In development. Over the coming years we expect&#13;
*   .            X               the coverage to evolve and grow, reflecting emerging issues in the global economy and greater&#13;
availability of data.&#13;
Previously published as an appendix to the World Development Report, the World Develop-&#13;
ment lndcators now takes its place as the World Bank's principal statistical survey of world devel-&#13;
opment. It contains most of the data previously published in the Bank's frld Tables and Social&#13;
Indicators of Development. Unlike the World Tables, which presented tables for each economy&#13;
containing long time series of macroeconomic data. the World Development Indicators follows a&#13;
cross-sectional format, with tables arranged topically.&#13;
Most tables show Indicators for a recent year and an earlier year, covering 148 economies&#13;
with populations of more than one million. Where possible, the Indicators are in growth rates or&#13;
shares. This format Is designed to facilitate comparative analysis of important economic trends&#13;
across countries and over time. For researchers who need time series of primary data, the fWrld&#13;
Developmnent Indicators CD-ROM contains time series of all Indicators available in the World Devel-&#13;
opment Indicators database. And for those who want a brief overview of the world economy. the&#13;
World Bank Atlas summarizes 34 current indicators for 209 economies In maps, graphs, and&#13;
tables.&#13;
We have trled to ensure that the Indicators are consistent with international standards and&#13;
are reasonably comparable across economies and over time. But the state of intemational sta-&#13;
tistics is not good. Many statistical offices are underfunded, and their staffs undertrained. In&#13;
some areas the importance of accurate measures of social and economic aggregates for policy&#13;
formulation is not recognized-or worse, statistics are manipulated to support policy. It is not&#13;
possible to correct for all possible sources of error. but where difficultles are known in collecting&#13;
and reporting data, we have-In what is another new feature-provided wamrings in general notes&#13;
or in specific footnotes to the tables. When data have been found to be unreliable or to deviate&#13;
seriously from accepted norms, they have been omitted. We have llmited our selection of Indica-&#13;
tors to those that are available for most of the principal economies.&#13;

Partners&#13;
Defining, gathering, and disseminating international statistics is a collective effort of many peo-&#13;
ple and organizations. The indicators presented in the World Development Indicators are the&#13;
fruit of decades of work at many levels, from the field workers who have administered censuses&#13;
and household surveys in every part of the world to the committees and working parties of the&#13;
national and international statistical agencies that have developed the nomenclature, classifi-&#13;
cations, and standards that are fundamental to an international statistical system. Non-&#13;
governmental organizations and the private sector have also made important contributions,&#13;
both in gathering primary data and in organizing and publishing their results. And academic&#13;
researchers have played a crucial role in developing statistical methods and carrying on a con-&#13;
tinuing dialogue about the quality and interpretation of statistical indicators. What all these&#13;
contributors have in common is a strong belief that accurate data, readily available, will improve&#13;
the quality of public and private decisionmaking.&#13;
Statistical indicators are a classic example of a public good. Like all information, they are&#13;
costly to collect, but once available in a convenient form, they can be shared widely at little&#13;
additional cost and with no diminution of their value. Indeed, it is of benefit for all to have good&#13;
information widely shared. One of the consequences of the public nature of statistical indica-&#13;
tors, however, is that they are often taken for granted and the work of those who developed&#13;
them goes unacknowledged. In the new World Development Indicators we want to take a first&#13;
step toward correcting this situation by identifying the organizations that have contributed data&#13;
directly to this volume. We recognize that such a list omits many others whose work is no less&#13;
vital. In the future we hope to see our list of partners grow. In the meantime we wish to acknowl-&#13;
edge our debt and gratitude to all those whose efforts have helped to build a base of compre-&#13;
hensive, quantitative information about the world and its people.&#13;
Food and Agriculture Organization&#13;
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was founded in October 1945 with a mandate to raise&#13;
nutrition levels and living standards, to improve agricultural productivity, and to better the condi-&#13;
tion of rural populations. Since its inception the FAO has worked to alleviate poverty and hunger&#13;
by promoting agricultural development, improved nutrition, and the pursuit of food security-the&#13;
access of all people at all times to the food they need for an active and healthy life. The organi-&#13;
zation provides direct development assistance; collects, analyzes, and disseminates information;&#13;
offers policy and planning advice to governments, and serves as an international forum for debate&#13;
on food and agricultural issues.&#13;
Statistical publications of the FAO include the Production Yearbook, Trade Yearbook, and Fer-&#13;
tilizer Yearbook The FAO makes much of its data available on diskette through its Agrostat PC&#13;
system&#13;
FAO publications can be ordered from national sales agents or directly from the FAO Distri-&#13;

International Civil Aviation Organization&#13;
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, was&#13;
founded with the signing of the Convention on International Civil Aviation on December 7, 1944 It&#13;
is responsible for establishing international standards and recommended practices and procedures&#13;
for the technical, economic, and legal aspects of international civil aviation operations.&#13;

The World Bank's classification&#13;
of economies&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World                          3&#13;
Bank's main criterion for classifying economies is&#13;
gross national product (GNP) per capita Every&#13;
country is classified as low income, middle&#13;
income (subdivided into lower middle and upper&#13;
middle), or high income. Consult the front cover                                             2.3&#13;

Statistical methods&#13;
This section describes some of the statistical procedures used in preparing the World Develop-&#13;
ment Indicators It covers the methods employed for calculating regional and income group aggre-&#13;
gates and for calculating growth rates, and it describes the World Bank's Atlas method for deriving&#13;
the conversion factor used to estimate GNP and GNP per capita in U.S dollars. Other statistical&#13;
procedures and calculations are described in the About the data sections that follow each table.&#13;
Aggregation rules&#13;
Because of missing data, aggregations of data for groups of economies should be treated as approx-&#13;
imations to unknown totals or average values. The regional and income group aggregates at the end&#13;
of most of the tables are based on the largest available set of data, including the values for the 148&#13;
economies shown in the main tables, the smaller economies shown in tables 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, and&#13;
Taiwan, China. The aggregation rules are intended to yield estimates for a consistent set of&#13;
economies from one time period to the next and for all indicators. However, small differences&#13;
between the values of subgroup aggregates and overall totals and averages may occur because of&#13;
the approximations used. In addition, discrepancies due to data reporting and accounting practices&#13;
may cause differences in such theoretically identical aggregates as world exports and world imports.&#13;
How group aggregates in the World Development Indicators are calculated depends on the&#13;
nature of the indicator. In group and world totals (indicated in the tables by t) missing data are&#13;
imputed using a suitable proxy variable in a benchmark year, usually 1987. The imputed value is&#13;
calculated so that it (or its proxy) bears the same relationship to the total of available data as it&#13;
did in the benchmark year. Imputed values are not calculated if missing data account for more&#13;
than one-third of the total in the benchmark year. Proxy variables are selected from a set of vari-&#13;
ables for which complete data are available for 1987. The variables used as proxies are GNP in&#13;
U.S. dollars, GNP per capita in U S. dollars, total population, exports and imports of goods and&#13;
services in U S. dollars, and value added in agriculture, industry, manufacturing, and services in&#13;
local currency&#13;
Aggregates of ratios are generally calculated as weighted averages of the ratios (indicated by&#13;
w) using the value of the denominator or, in some cases, another indicator as a weight. The aggre-&#13;
gate ratios are based on the available data, including data for economies not shown in the main&#13;
tables Missing values are assumed to have the same average value as the available data. If miss-&#13;
ing data account for approximately one-third of the total value of the weights in the benchmark&#13;
year, no aggregate is calculated. In a few cases the aggregate ratio may be computed as the ratio&#13;
of group totals after imputing values for missing data according to the rules for computing totals.&#13;
Aggregates calculated as medians of the available data are indicated by m&#13;
Aggregate growth rates are generally computed as the weighted averages of growth rates. In&#13;
a few cases growth rates may be computed from time series of group totals (see the discussion&#13;
below on methods of computing growth rates) Growth rates are not calculated if more than one-&#13;
third of the observations in a period are missing.&#13;
Exceptions to the rules occur throughout the book. Depending on the judgment of World Bank&#13;
analysts, the aggregates may be based on as little as 60 percent of the available data. In other&#13;
cases, where missing or excluded values are judged to be small or irrelevant, aggregates are&#13;
based only on the data shown in the tables.&#13;
Growth rates&#13;
Growth rates shown in the World Development Indicators are calculated as annual averages and&#13;
represented as percentages. Except where noted, growth rates of values are computed from con-&#13;
stant price or real value series Three main methods are used to calculate growth rates: the least&#13;
squares, the exponential endpoint, and the geometric endpoint Rates of change from one period&#13;
to the next are calculated as proportional changes from the earlier period Note, however, that the&#13;
annual changes in the speed of integration indicators in table 6 1 are not proportional growth rates&#13;
but average annual differences.&#13;
xxiv World Development Indicators 1997&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Least-squares growth rate. Least-squares growth rates are used wherever there is a sufficiently&#13;
long time series to permit a reliable calculation. If more than one-half of the observations in a&#13;
period are missing, no growth rate is calculated.&#13;
The least-squares growth rate, r, is estimated by fitting a linear regression trend line to the&#13;
logarithmic annual values of the variable in the relevant period. The regression equation takes the&#13;
form&#13;
log X, = a + bt,&#13;
which is equivalent to the logarithmic transformation of the compound growth equation,&#13;
Xt = X. (1 + r)t .&#13;
In this equation X is the variable, t is time, and a = log X. and b = log (1 + r) are the para-&#13;
meters to be estimated. If b* is the least-squares estimate of b, the average annual growth rate,&#13;
r, is obtained as [antilog (b*) - 1] and multiplied by 100 for expression as a percentage.&#13;
The calculated growth rate is an average rate that is representative of the available observa-&#13;
tions over the period. It does not necessarily match the actual growth rate between any two periods.&#13;
Exponential growth rate. The growth rate between two points in time for labor force and popu-&#13;
lation indicators is calculated from the equation&#13;
r= ln(pn/p1)/n&#13;
where pn and p, are the last and first observations in the period, n is the number of years in the&#13;
period, and In is the natural logarithm operator.&#13;
This growth rate is based on a model of continuous, exponential growth between two points&#13;
in time. It does not take into account the intermediate values of the series.&#13;
Geometric growth rate. The geometric growth rate is applicable to compound growth over dis-&#13;
crete periods, such as the payment and reinvestment of interest or dividends. Although continu-&#13;
ous growth, as modeled by the exponential growth rate, may be more realistic, most economic&#13;
phenomena are measured only at intervals for which the compound growth model is appropriate.&#13;
The average growth rate over n periods is calculated as&#13;
r= exp{[ln(pn/p,)]/n} - 1.&#13;
World Bank Atlas method&#13;
In calculating GNP in U.S. dollars and GNP per capita for certain operational purposes, the World&#13;
Bank uses a synthetic exchange rate commonly called the Atlas conversion factor. The purpose of&#13;
this conversion factor is to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in the cross-country&#13;
comparison of national incomes.&#13;
The Atlas conversion factor for any year is the average of a country's exchange rate (or alter-&#13;
native conversion factor) for that year and its exchange rates for the two preceding years, after&#13;
adjustment for differences between the inflation rate in the country and the inflation rate in the&#13;
G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The coun-&#13;
try's rate of inflation is measured by its GNP deflator. The inflation rate for G-5 countries is mea-&#13;
sured by changes in the deflator for the SDR (special drawing right, the International Monetary&#13;
Fund's unit of account). The SDR deflator is calculated as a weighted average of the G-5 coun-&#13;
tries' GDP deflators in SDR terms. The weights are determined by the amount of each currency&#13;
included in one SDR unit. Weights vary over time both because the IMF changes the composition&#13;
World Development Indicators 1997 xxv&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of the SDR and because the SDR exchange rate for each currency changes. The SDR deflator is&#13;
calculated in SDR terms first and then converted to U.S. dollars using the SDR to dollar Atlas con-&#13;
version factor.&#13;
This three-year averaging smooths annual fluctuations in prices and exchange rates for each&#13;
country. The Atlas conversion factor is applied to the country's GNP The resulting GNP in U.S. dol-&#13;
lars is divided by the midyear population for the latest of the three years to derive GNP per capita.&#13;
When official exchange rates are deemed to be unreliable or unrepresentative of the effective&#13;
exchange rate during a period, an alternative estimate of the exchange rate is used in the Atlas&#13;
formula (see below).&#13;
The following formulas describe the computation of the Atlas conversion factor for year t:&#13;
e,  et2   t /  t1)+ et-:, Pt /  t$+ et]&#13;
Pt-2  Pt-2 )      Pt-I  Pt-I)&#13;
and for calculating GNP per capita in U.S. dollars for year t&#13;
Yt$ = (Yl/Nt)let*&#13;
where et* is the Atlas conversion factor (national currency to the U.S dollar) in year t, et is the aver-&#13;
age annual exchange rate (national currency to the U S dollar) for year t, Pt is the GNP deflator for&#13;
year t, ps$ is the SDR deflator in U.S. dollar terms for year t, Y1$ is the Atlas GNP in U.S dollars in&#13;
year t, Yt is current GNP (local currency) for year t, and Nt is the midyear population for year t&#13;
Alternative conversion factors&#13;
The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as con-&#13;
version factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is judged&#13;
to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to domestic transac-&#13;
tions of foreign currencies and traded products, the case for only a small number of countries (see&#13;
Primary data documentation). Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas method and&#13;
elsewhere in the World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Primary data documentation&#13;
The World Bank is not a primary data collection agency for most areas other than living standards&#13;
surveys and debt. As a major user of socioeconomic data, however, the World Bank places par-&#13;
ticular emphasis on data documentation to inform users of data in economic analysis and policy-&#13;
making. The tables in this section provide information on the sources, treatment, and currentness&#13;
of the principal demographic, economic, and environmental indicators in the World Development&#13;
Indicators.&#13;
Differences in the methods and conventions used by the primary data collectors-usually&#13;
national statistical agencies, central banks, and customs services-may give rise to significant&#13;
discrepancies over time both among and within countries. Delays in reporting data and the use&#13;
of old surveys as the base for current estimates may severely compromise the quality of national&#13;
data.&#13;
Although data quality is improving in some countries, many developing countries lack the&#13;
resources to train and maintain the skilled staff and obtain the equipment needed to measure&#13;
and report demographic, economic, and environmental trends in an accurate and timely way. The&#13;
World Bank recognizes the need for reliable data to measure living standards, track and evaluate&#13;
economic trends, and plan and monitor development projects. Thus, in concert with bilateral and&#13;
other multilateral agencies, it has funded and participated in technical assistance projects to&#13;
improve statistical organization and basic data methods, collection, and dissemination.&#13;
The World Bank is working at several levels to meet the challenge of improving the quality of&#13;
the data that it collates and disseminates. At the country level the Bank is carrying out technical&#13;
assistance, training, and survey activities-with a view to strengthening national capacity-in the&#13;
following areas:&#13;
*  Poverty assessments in most borrower member countries.&#13;
:  Living standards measurement and other household and farm surveys with country partner&#13;
statistical agencies.&#13;
*  National accounts and inflation.&#13;
:  Price and expenditure surveys for the International Comparison Programme.&#13;
:  Statistical improvement projects in the economies of the former Soviet Union.&#13;
*  External debt management.&#13;
*  Environmental and economic accounting.&#13;
At the institutional level the World Bank undertook a major renewal program, forming a new&#13;
unit, the Development Data Group, to concentrate on collecting, enhancing the quality of, and dis-&#13;
seminating development indicators. New initiatives include:&#13;
*  Improving documentation of data collected by the World Bank.&#13;
*  Enhancing dialogue with primary data producers in the field and improving data partnerships&#13;
within the Bank and with other agencies that are major data producers.&#13;
*  Upgrading systems and technology to improve data collection and management and to dis-&#13;
seminate data to a broader audience through CD-ROMs and the Internet.&#13;
*  Strengthening partnerships with other multilateral agencies to improve coordination of sta-&#13;
tistical capacity building activities in developing countries.&#13;

No word might be used but what marks either number, weight or measure.&#13;
-Sir William Petty, 1676&#13;
The organization and coverage of the World Development Indicators reflect the priori-&#13;
r tes of an institution dedicated to promoting economic development, The focus is&#13;
on people, the environment, the economy, the relative roles of states and markets, and&#13;
the links between industrial and developing economies But what is development?&#13;
And how do we measure it?&#13;
Life's quality&#13;
Since the 17th century economists have viewed development as a means of improving&#13;
standards of living and the quality of life in very broad terms. Sir William Petty, one of&#13;
the first development economists, was interested not only in national income but also&#13;
in such factors as "the Common Safety" and "each Man's particular Happiness" (cited&#13;
in Sen 1988).&#13;
"Ultimately," Amartya Sen argues that "the assessment of development&#13;
achieved cannot be a matter only of quantification of the means of that achieve-&#13;
ment. The concept of development has to take note of the actual achievements&#13;
themselves" (1988, p. 15). These achievements-Sen labels them as "function-&#13;
ings"-include the length of life (life expectancy) and the "nature of life" and&#13;
what people value as important to their well-being (nourishment, good health,&#13;
clean air and water, the ability to move about freely).&#13;
True, these values differ greatly from individual to individual, reflecting different&#13;
aspirations, conceptions, abilities, and tastes-and from society to society, reflecting&#13;
culture and tradition. Yet there clearly are certain basic needs common to all mankind&#13;
for food, health, shelter, and personal freedoms, which if met constitute development&#13;
(Dasgupta 1993).&#13;
In measunng development, it helps to distnguish between indicators that measure&#13;
the "constituents" of development (such outcomes as health and literacy) and those that&#13;
measure its "determinants," the goods and services that produce development or well-&#13;
being, such as food, shelter, safe drinking water, clean air, education, health care, and real&#13;
national income (Dasgupta and Weale 1992). Partha Dasgupta and Martin Weale show a&#13;
strong correlation between the rankings of 48 developing countries for GNP per capita&#13;
(adjusted for purchasing power parity) and their rankings for five other indicators (life&#13;
expectancy, infant mortality, adult literacy, political rights, and civil nghts). This leads&#13;
Dasgupta to observe that "recent suggestions that national income is a vastly misleading&#13;
index are not borne out by this exercise. We can do better than merely rely on national&#13;
income, but we wouldn't have been wildly off the mark as regards an ordinal comparison&#13;
of countries had we relied exclusively on national income per head" (1993, p. 115).&#13;
Not the same for all&#13;
One reason to go beyond national income is to capture inequalities in access to&#13;
resources. Life expectancy, infant mortality, and adult literacy measure outcomes, but&#13;
they also say much about differential access to assets and income and about other per-&#13;
vasive forms of differentiation based on gender.&#13;
The causes of gender inequality, linked as they are to the decisions in households,&#13;
are particularly complex. Regardless of how such decisions are made, they clearly are&#13;
influenced by market signals and institutional and cultural norms that do not capture&#13;
the full benefits to society of investing in women. Limited education and training,&#13;
poor health and nutrition, and denied access to resources depress women's quality of&#13;
World Development Indicators 1997 3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
life-and hinder economic efficiency and growth. This is dis-&#13;
turbing, because women are agents of change, shaping the&#13;
welfare of future generations.&#13;
Social and environmental sustainability&#13;
The environment can no longer be thought of as a source of&#13;
free goods and services. Environmental values and costs                   * *              -&#13;
should be included when measuring the quality of life.&#13;
Although this is easier said than done, we cannot ignore the&#13;
damage that people do to their environment or the damage&#13;
done to themselves through environmental degradation. The&#13;
poor often suffer the most. They cannot escape the polluted                   . -&#13;
air in the streets of cities or from the open fires burning&#13;
wood or dung in rural areas. They cannot protect themselves    -       -              - - .&#13;
from  contaminated water, and their farmlands are more&#13;
likely to suffer from soil erosion. Development may be a cure         -         - * *    I&#13;

history (Drucker 1994).&#13;
At the beginning of the 20th century farmers constituted&#13;
the largest single group in today's industrial economies. Today&#13;
they make up no more than 5 percent of the workforce. Even      - -  _          a&#13;
blue-collar workers, who dominated the labor force of high-&#13;
income economies in the 1950s, have retreated to proportions    - ,&#13;
common at the beginning of the century.&#13;
East Asian economies are now experiencing a similar-pos- &#13;
sibly even faster-structural transformation. But they are at                                    _-&#13;
one extreme. At the other are many countries and parts of          _                             __&#13;
countries that remain untouched by major change.&#13;
Fueling the structural transformation is economic            -   -.  .   . -          --&#13;
growth, the "expansion in productive resources and the&#13;
increase in the efficiency of their use" (Syrquin 1988). This  . _            . -       -n&#13;
growth comes through increases in inputs and through tech-               _                  _            _&#13;
nical change. A proxy for technical change is the growth of&#13;
what is called total factor productivity (TFP)-that is, the&#13;
contribution to economic growth by the increase in produc-&#13;
tivity of all factors combined-of such inputs as land, natural&#13;
resources, and human and physical capital. In practice, how-&#13;
ever, it is difficult to disentangle technical change from the&#13;
factors of production, because that change is embodied in&#13;
labor (through education, training, and experience) and in    .              j. .&#13;
capital (through the innovations embodied by machinery&#13;
and equipment).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Developing countries nevertheless appear to experience   inelastic demand for food. So, food prices fall relative to other&#13;
slower TFP growth than do the industrial countries-and    consumer prices.&#13;
countries that grow faster typically enjoy faster TFP growth    *  In household budgets food's share declines with sustained&#13;

The ultimate aim of development is to improve human well-being in a substantial&#13;
and sustainable way. Human capital development-the product of education and&#13;
improvements in health and nutrition-is both a part of and a means of achieving&#13;
this goal&#13;
The importance of investing in human capital has become clearer in recent years,&#13;
with increasing evidence on how and to what extent such investments interact with&#13;
other factors in development as forces for change. This secton allows readers to eval-&#13;
uate how well different economies are doing in building human capital and extending&#13;
human welfare&#13;
Living standards have been improving all over the world. Globally, real GNP per&#13;
capita has increased by more than 3 percent a year on average since the mid-1960s. But&#13;
while only the East Asian miracle economies have been able to sustain this (or even&#13;
higher) income growth for long periods, improvements in social indicators have been&#13;
sustained in all regions for much of the past 25 years Many developing countries have&#13;
succeeded in reducing poverty, a few by as much as 50 percent (World Bank 1990).&#13;
Average infant mortality rates for low- and middle-income countries have declined from&#13;
107 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 60 in 1995; life expectancy at birth increased from&#13;
an average 55 years to 64 years The world today is healthier, better educated, and better&#13;
fed than it was 25 years ago.&#13;
These achievements nevertheless mask vast dispanties across regions and countries.&#13;
Infant mortality remains above 90 per 1,000 live births in Sub-Saharan Africa and 70 in&#13;
South Asia, compared with 40 for EastAsia. Average life expectancy at birth is only 52 years&#13;
in Africa, compared with more than 60 for other regions. Primary school enrollment in&#13;
some African countries has declined, and secondary school enrollment is only 24 percent,&#13;
compared with over 50 percent for some other developing regions. And as the world&#13;
approaches the turn of the century, more than 1.3 billion people are living on less than&#13;
$1 a day, and another 2 billion are only slightly better off. Most of the poor-about 60 per-&#13;
cent-live in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, which together account for 14 percent&#13;
of the aggregate GDP of developing countnes and 3 percent of the world's.&#13;
Poverty reduction requires action simultaneously to stimulate growth through&#13;
sound economic policies that promote sustainable, equitable development and to&#13;
invest heavily in human capital through improvements in education, health, nutrition,&#13;
and other social services (World Bank 1990). While this section focuses on human cap-&#13;
ital, sections 4 and 5 look at economic growth and its preconditions.&#13;
Why does human capital matter?&#13;
Because the poor's most significant asset is their labor, the most effective way to improve&#13;
their welfare is to increase their employment opportunities and the productivity of their&#13;
labor through investments in human capital. Often, the poor are unable to finance such&#13;
investments. So the challenge is to create an enabling environment and to mobilize&#13;
resources for human capital investments.&#13;
Human capital is critical in raising the living standards of the poor. Health care and&#13;
good nutrition reduce sickness and mortality and improve labor productivity. Literacy&#13;
and numeracy widen horizons, making it easier for people to learn new skills through-&#13;
out their working lives, and thus ensure full participation in social and economic life. By&#13;
raising productivity, investments in education stimulate growth, and by opening eco-&#13;
nomic opportunities to more people, they help reduce income inequality. In turn, faster&#13;
World Development Indicators 1997 29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
growth and greater equality increase the supply of, and demand&#13;
for, education.&#13;
Better education and health enable couples to make more&#13;
informed decisions about the number and spacing of their chil-&#13;
dren and about their schooling, and to protect maternal and&#13;
child health. The improved health of educated people motivates&#13;
them to make still more investments in their education and&#13;
health. The relatonship between investments and outcomes is&#13;
thus mutually reinforcing, justifying investments in human cap-&#13;
ital on both economic and equity grounds.&#13;
Developing countries have already made big investments in&#13;
human capital development, assisted by private and official devel-&#13;
opment agencies More recently, governments have taken new ini-&#13;
tiatives to address social issues and identified specific goals, based&#13;
on agreed targets, to measure progress (see box 1 a in section 1).&#13;
The poverty of data&#13;
Many indicators have been proposed to measure progress in&#13;
building human capital Yet there are continuing problems with&#13;
the quality of data that cast doubts on the reliability of the indi-&#13;
cators and raise concerns about their use in decisionmaking&#13;
(Srinivasan 1994). Data often suffer from conceptual problems,&#13;
measurement biases and errors, and lack of comparability over&#13;
time and across countries. The specialized United Nations agen-&#13;
cies that standardize concepts and methods of data collecton are&#13;
underfinanced, and government commitment to data collection,&#13;
including allocation of sufficient human and financial resources,&#13;
often falls prey to budget cuts.&#13;
Not surprisingly, population censuses often become the main&#13;
source of information on most aspects of human capital, sup-&#13;
plemented by official estimates based on the censuses and sur-&#13;
veys or broad generalizations. The problem is that censuses are&#13;
infrequent (usually decennial), have long processing times, and&#13;
fail to reflect such aspects of human capital development as&#13;
access to and quahty of social services. Important supplements&#13;
to population censuses are specialized household surveys that&#13;
gather information on the level and extent of poverty and on the&#13;
impact of government policies on poor and vulnerable popula-&#13;
tions. Household surveys have other advantages. They can be&#13;
conducted frequently and more cheaply than censuses and are&#13;
increasingly used to measure living standards.&#13;
The indicators reported here share many of these shortcom-&#13;
ings (detailed notes on their quality are presented with each&#13;
table). With these caveats, the data nevertheless help quantify&#13;
the consequences of poverty, allow intertemporal and cross-&#13;
country comparisons, and highlight social problems that need&#13;
to be resolved.&#13;
Population and the labor force&#13;
Worldwide, policymakers have tended to focus on the high pop-&#13;
ulation growth in many developing countries. Although the fer-&#13;
tility rate has declined by one birth per woman in the past 15&#13;
years, average population growth rates have fallen less (tables 2.1&#13;
and 2.2). Between 1980 and 2030 the population of developing&#13;
countries will more than double-to 7.2 billion, compared with&#13;

The percentage of the cohort reaching grade 4,&#13;
rather than some other grade, is shown for two rea-&#13;
sons First, because of differences among countries in&#13;
the duration of primary schooling, which ranges from&#13;
three to 10 grades (see table 2 7 for each country's&#13;
duration of primary schooling), grade 4 estimates are&#13;
more comparable across countries than are estimates&#13;
for other grades Second, using grade 4 minimizes the&#13;
effect of repetition at or close to the final grade of pri-&#13;
mary education&#13;
Progression to secondary school measures the pro-&#13;

Most education systems do not prepare&#13;
boys and girls equally for occupations.&#13;
Studies of learning styles in industrial coun-&#13;
tries have found that women leave school&#13;
with fewer opportunities for continuing their&#13;
education and poor prospects of translating&#13;
their higher-level education into social and&#13;

Africa-&#13;
economic advancement At the postsec-&#13;
ondary and higher levels, where the gap in&#13;
enrollment between women and men is wider,&#13;
there is implicit "gender streaming,' or sex&#13;
segregation by field of study. This phenome-&#13;
non, widespread in both developing and&#13;
industrial countries, discourages women&#13;
from acquiring training in a variety of fields,&#13;
especially the "hard" sciences, mathemat-&#13;
ics, and engineering.&#13;
In the teaching profession, one of the largest&#13;
occupational fields requiring advanced train-&#13;
ing, women are well represented in many coun-&#13;
tries, often constituting more than half of the&#13;
total qualified employed. But a hierarchical pat-&#13;
tern of occupational segregation leads to&#13;
inequality between women and men at both the&#13;
top and the bottom of the profession. In many&#13;
countries men move upto better-paid and more&#13;
prestigious positions in secondary and higher&#13;
education as these levels expand, while&#13;
women predominate at the primary level.&#13;

Today some 1.5 billion people live exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution, 1 bil-&#13;
lion live without clean water, and 2 billion live without sanitation. Although food&#13;
production doubled over the past quarter-century and outstripped population growth,&#13;
the gains may have come at the cost of lost crop diversity and natural habitats-and&#13;
more chemical contamination. Some estimates suggest that a seventh of the world's&#13;
tropical forests have been lost in the past 25 years.&#13;
These problems are not just local or national-they are global, as evidenced by&#13;
growing regional pollution, epidemics of disease, the loss of biodiversity, potential&#13;
global climate effects, and the possibility of "environmental refugees" leaving severely&#13;
degraded areas.&#13;
Poverty arising from lack of economic development is at the root of many environ-&#13;
mental problems. Only with accelerated economic development in poor countries can&#13;
environmental problems be tackled. True, economic growth can make some environ-&#13;
mental problems worse, but without growth environmental problems will be harder to&#13;
address. So it is not useftil to think of development and the environment as involving a&#13;
tradeoff. The only sensible approach is to ensure-through better environmental stew-&#13;
ardship-that future economic development is socially and environmentally sustainable.&#13;
As we have come to better understand the links between economic development&#13;
and the environment, it has become broadly accepted that inappropriate economic&#13;
policies have a high cost for the environment, that poverty and environmental prob-&#13;
lems are closely linked, that environmental values have to be incorporated in the prices&#13;
that guide economic growth, and that regional and global actions are essential to deal&#13;
with environmental problems that cross national borders.&#13;
Broad acceptance of these propositions does not mean, however, that they have&#13;
been translated into effective policies. Indeed, environmental problems continue to&#13;
worsen in many countries. But growing national awareness of environmental issues and&#13;
the way economic activities affect the environment is at last influencing the thinking of&#13;
policymakers. For example, a few counthes have reduced per capita carbon dioxide&#13;
(CO2) emissions over the past decade, and several others, mostly high-income coun-&#13;
tries, have exceeded the informal objective of designating 10 percent of total land area&#13;
as protected areas.&#13;
We are learning more about how economic and environmental systems are inter-&#13;
connected-and how actions in one system can have important effects on the other.&#13;
The environment can no longer be thought of as a source of "free" environmental&#13;
goods and services-free forests, free fish, free freshwater. Nor can it be thought of&#13;
as just a sink for disposing of waste products from homes, industries, and other&#13;
sources.&#13;
Measuring the environment&#13;
The environment is a cross-cutting issue, and this must be reflected in environmental&#13;
indicators Some indicators deal with environmental "goods," such as protected areas&#13;
or biodiversity. Others measure deforestation or soil loss, or pollution of the air or water.&#13;
And still others monitor the effects of environmental degradation-such as waterborne&#13;
disease, species loss, or number of threatened species. Such indicators are important&#13;
because the links between the environmental and economic worlds are direct and&#13;
immediate. Growth at the expense of the environment, or of the health of a nation's&#13;
population, is likely to be unsustainable.&#13;

extractive use is allowed within these areas&#13;
Designating land as a protected area does not nec-&#13;
essarily mean, however, that protection is in force&#13;
Threatened species are defined according to the&#13;
IUCN's classification categories endangered (in&#13;
danger of extinction and survival unlikely if causal fac-&#13;
tors continue operating), vulnerable (likely to move&#13;
into the endangered category in the near future if&#13;
causal factors continue operating), rare (not endan-&#13;
gered or vulnerable, but at risk), indeterminate&#13;
(known to be endangered, vulnerable, or rare but not&#13;
enough information is available to say which), out of&#13;
danger (formerly included in one of the above cate-&#13;
gories. but now considered relatively secure because&#13;
appropriate conservation measures are in effect),&#13;
and insufficiently known (suspected but not definitely&#13;
known to belong to any of the above categories)&#13;
Figures on species are not necessarily comparable&#13;
across countries because taxonomic concepts and&#13;
coverage vary And while the number of mammals and&#13;
birds is fairly well known, it is difficult to make an&#13;
accurate account of plants&#13;

In the past 25 years, in the expanding global economy, the developing economies have&#13;
played an increasingly important role. This trend has four characteristics:&#13;
* Steady growth and structural transformation, led by low- and middle-income economies&#13;
that have pursued successful adjustment policies.&#13;
* Rapid integration of developing economies in the global economy, marked by expanding&#13;
trade and capital flows.&#13;
a  Improved polcy environments in developzngeconomies, with better macroeconomic man-&#13;
agement and economic liberalization driving growth and integration&#13;
*  Increasingdisparities within the developingworld, with some regions pulling rapidly ahead&#13;
(such as East Asia) and others in danger of being marginalized (Sub-Saharan Africa).&#13;
The indicators presented in this section attempt to measure changes in the global&#13;
economy and the differential impact of these changes on developing economies. They&#13;
are mainly indicators that traditionally appear in the World Development Indicators, mea-&#13;
suring outcomes in the structure and rates of change of output, trade, and aggregate&#13;
demand and in macroeconomic performance, including central government budgets,&#13;
money supply, prices, balance of payments, and external debt. Like other data in this&#13;
book, the data in this section are subject to conceptual and practcal measurement prob-&#13;
lems that limit their comparability and usefulness (box 4a).&#13;
Developing economies outpace the world&#13;
The world economy grew at about 3 percent a year in the 1980s, slowIng to 2 percent&#13;
in the first half of the 1990s. Low- and middle-income economies, excluding Eastern&#13;
Europe and the economies of the former Soviet Union, grew more rapidly, averaging&#13;
3.4 percent in the 1980s and 5 percent in the first half of the 1990s.&#13;
Growth among developing countries was dominated by the populous economies of&#13;
East and South Asia. East Asia's economies grew at almost 8 percent a year in the 1980s&#13;
and at 10 percent in the 1990s. In South Asia growth was almost 6 percent a year in the&#13;
1980s and roughly 5 percent in the 1990s. In the early 1980s Latin America's growth&#13;
was hurt by the debt crisis and the halt in private capital flows. The debt crisis came to&#13;
an end in the early 1990s, when these countries began to see much faster growth. In&#13;
the same period Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa had disap-&#13;
pointing growth performance, reflecting poor policies, falling commodity prices, and,&#13;
in Sub-Saharan Africa, growing official debt. Eastern Europe and the economies of the&#13;
former Soviet Union-the transition economies-suffered from the collapse of the&#13;
Soviet system and the end of state trading regimes; in the early 1990s their growth was&#13;
negative.&#13;
Developing economies that have done well have some important similarities:&#13;
* High rates of domestic savings have helped to sustain high rates of investment. The fast-&#13;
growing economies of EastAsia are investing between 27 percent and 43 percent of GDP,&#13;
while Chile is investing 27 percent and India 25 percent (tables 4.12 and 4.13).&#13;
* Rapid growth in trade has increased the share of trade in GDP East Asia's export growth&#13;
in the 1980s exceeded its GDP growth at around 9 percent a year-almost twice the rate&#13;
for world exports. By the 1990s East Asian exports were growing at a remarkable 18 per-&#13;
cent a year (almost three times the rate of growth of world exports). South Asian export&#13;
growth has also been impressive-7 percent a year in the 1980s and 9 percent in the&#13;
1990s. As a result, the share of merchandise trade (exports plus imports) in GDP for&#13;
developing economies as a group rose from 38 percent in 1980 to 44 percent in 1995.&#13;
World Development Indicators 1997 127&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Most of the increase, however, was in 10 economies, mostly in&#13;
East Asia (tables 4.8 and 4.9).&#13;
* Agnculture's zmportance is declining. In China agriculture's share&#13;
in GDP between 1980 and 1995 fell from 30 percent to 21 per-&#13;
cent. In India it declined from 38 percent to 29 percent, in&#13;
Indonesia from 24 percent to 17 percent, in Thailand from 23&#13;
percent to 11 percent, in Malaysia from 22 percent to 13 per-&#13;
cent, and in the Republic of Korea, which moved from middle-&#13;
income to high-income status during this period, from 15 percent&#13;
to 7 percent (tables 4.1 and 4.2).&#13;
*  The share of manufactured exports is rising. Further evidence of&#13;
the structural transformation of these economies is seen in the&#13;
increasing importance of manufactures in exports, a measure of&#13;
access to learning, technology transfer, and the ability to produce&#13;
at world standards. Between 1973-82 and 1983-92 the share of      -    -       @ .*&#13;
manufactures in merchandise exports rose in East Asia from 35&#13;
percent to 50 percent, and in South Asia from 45 percent to 65          .&#13;
percent (World Bank 1996c, p. 24).&#13;
The global economy integrates steadily&#13;
Since World War II international trade has consistently grown   09                    -&#13;
faster than output (table 4a). In the 1950s and 1960s this trend  E  l&#13;
reflected recovery from the stagnation of the interwar years and  E  l&#13;
a buoyant world economy. In the 1970s and 1980s world trade&#13;
growth slowed but continued to outpace growth in the global      l&#13;
economy. Led by rapid growth of East Asian exports, world trade&#13;
in the 1990s is once again outstripping world output. In tandem&#13;
with sharp growth in merchandise trade, there has been even&#13;
sharper growth in services, whose share in world trade rose from                 l&#13;
16 percent in 1980 to 18 percent in 1995.&#13;
Growth in trade has come from increasing trade liberaliza-               -              - l&#13;
tion, a result of successive international trade negotiations. Tariffs    l     l&#13;
in industrial countries have fallen from 40 percent of imports             -    - l_&#13;
in the 1950s to around 3-4 percent today. Developing coun-     l            * l l&#13;
tries, too, have reduced tariffs dramatically. In Latin America    l            i          * 1            0&#13;
they have come down to around 15 percent, in Sub-Saharan           i&#13;
Africa and the Middle East and North Africa to 25-30 percent,    l 1 &#13;
and in South Asia, which traditionally had high tariffs, to 45     i&#13;
percent (Finger, Ingco, and Reincke 1996). Under the Uruguay&#13;
Round agreements countries are also progressively dismantling&#13;
nontariff barriers.&#13;
In some developing countries trade integration goes hand&#13;
in hand with financial integration, with private capital flows,&#13;
particularlyforeign direct investment (FDI), rising strongly (tables&#13;
4.22 and 5.2). Foreign direct investment to developing economies  *                           _&#13;
in 1995 accounted for 33 percent of all FDI, compared with 13         - _ l&#13;
percent in 1990.&#13;
Policies make a difference ...&#13;
Increased openness of economies and progressive dismantling                      _&#13;
of regulations and controls have been features of the economic    i                           _   1311-&#13;
policies of developing countries since 1980. Those that have&#13;
seen the most rapid growth and integration have also had better             - _             l                  l&#13;

No single indicator by itself or in compari-&#13;
son to the value for another country is fully&#13;
diagnostic. For example, a high level of debt&#13;
may reflect the confidence of investors in the&#13;
economy's future prospects. A large current&#13;
account deficit may stem from high levels of&#13;
private investment. And high inflation or a large&#13;
fiscal deficit can occur despite good policies-&#13;
the result of a supply-side shock caused by a&#13;
poor harvest or deteriorating terms of trade.&#13;

Traditionally, index numbers of wholesale prices&#13;
have been based on the price3 of commodities that&#13;
have some significance in the output or consumption&#13;
of the country. Many wholesale price indexes now refer&#13;
to a mix of agricultural and industrial goods at vari-&#13;
ous stages of production and distribution, including&#13;
imports and import duties. In general, a Laspeyres&#13;
index is used.&#13;
Recently, some countries have compiled more spe-&#13;
cialized price indexes. Core inFlation, for example, is&#13;
measured by price changes for goods that affect the&#13;
whole structure of prices. Such commodities as gaso-&#13;
ine, electricity, food staples, a id transport fares form&#13;
;he core elements of the basket. And many coun-&#13;
tries maintain price indexes for baskets of goods&#13;
typically consumed by specific groups, such as the&#13;
old, or industrial workers. In some economies these&#13;
indexes are used in making cost-of-living adjustments&#13;
to social welfare benefits or in indexing wages.&#13;

shown that debt service difficulties become&#13;
increasingly likely when the ratio of the present&#13;
value of debt to exports reaches 200-250 per-&#13;
cent and the debt service ratio exceeds 20-25&#13;

and high current expenditure rates.&#13;

t is increasingly recognized that "governments need to do less in those areas where&#13;
markets work or can be made to work reasonably well" (World Bank 1991b) and more&#13;
in those areas-such as education, health, nutrition, and regulation-where markets&#13;
alone cannot be relied utpon. By unleashing competitive forces and enhancing interna-&#13;
tional competitiveness, a healthy private sector can provide both growth and jobs.&#13;
Many developing country governments are shifting their priorities from preserving&#13;
jobs in a stagnant public sector to creating jobs in a vibrant private sector. This shift&#13;
implies a fundamental change in the role of government-from owner and operator&#13;
to policymaker and regulator, working closely with the private sector to develop a com-&#13;
petitive, outward-looking economy (World Bank 1995e). This section provides indica-&#13;
tors that reflect these shifting roles.&#13;
The new strategy requires that developing countries:&#13;
* Establish a more inviting business environment. Sound macroeconomic management&#13;
has to supplant stop-go policies that undermine the confidence of the private sector.&#13;
But governments also have to promote competition and reduce risk-and especially to&#13;
cut the high costs of doing business. This means pressing ahead on an array of policy,&#13;
legal. regulatory, and institutional reforms in partnership with business and labor.&#13;
*  Acceleratefinancial rebfrm. Governments also have to restructure and, when appro-&#13;
priate, privatize banks, strengthen regulation and supervision, and develop the basic&#13;
financial infrastructure to service a broad segment of the population, especially small&#13;
businesses.&#13;
a  Go faster and farther wJith public entepnrise reform. Governments have to privatize utili-&#13;
ties and large enterprises-and, where appropriate, liquidate major loss-makers.&#13;
Employing only a small fraction of the labor force, these enterprises absorb a large part&#13;
of government expenditures and account for a large part of the losses of the banking&#13;
system. Failure to deal with these losses threatens reform programs and diverts&#13;
resources from pressing social needs.&#13;
Two major objectives of the new strategy are to stop the hemorrhaging of the bank-&#13;
ing system and to imprcve infrastructure services essential for competing in a dynamic&#13;
global economy.&#13;
Many countries havc implemented parts of this new strategy for private sector devel-&#13;
opment, and the response has been impressive. But even in countries with well-estab-&#13;
lished institutions and legal systems-and the human resources to translate&#13;
commitment into action-reform is a long process that may take more than a decade&#13;
and is subject to reversal and fragility.&#13;
The poorest countries lack many of the prerequisites for such a sustained effort-&#13;
and have little latitude for error. The challenges are particularly daunting in Africa,&#13;
where the business environment for entrepreneurs is shaky, markets are small, skills are&#13;
shallow and narrowv, the supporting infrastructure is weak, and laws and regulations are&#13;
very restrictive.&#13;
Tracking progress&#13;
How to track countries' progress in developing the private sector? By following three sets&#13;
of inclicators (World Bank 1991a). A changing public-private balance is reflected in an&#13;
expanding private sector and a dwindling government role in the economy. Private&#13;
sector growth shows up in higher private sector credit and investment, in flows of pri-&#13;
vate capital, and in expanding capital markets. As the private sector grows, the govern-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ment shifts out of providing services and into building human&#13;
resources-and its intervention in the economy subsides. This&#13;
shift shows up in the amount and composition of central gov-&#13;
ernment expenditure, in the amounts of public investment, pub-     . -n ... . -.. *;.--.- *n*     - *  * . ... &#13;

structure, and scientific and technological capacity-&#13;
The private sector's share in economic activity has increased                           -&#13;
dramatically in many countries and in the developing world as                                           .&#13;
a whole, but in far too many countries excessive fiscal deficits&#13;
still crowd out private investment and raise the cost of domes-&#13;
tic borrowing.&#13;
Even so, some countries have begun to attract sizable&#13;
amounts of private capital flows in recent years (tables 5.1 and&#13;
5.2). For countries, this reflects their greater receptivity to for-&#13;
eign capital, and for investors, their search for higher returns&#13;
and for better diversification of risk (box 5a).&#13;
Developing country stock markets are also beginning to&#13;
attr-act significant inflows of foreign portfolio equity invest-     6 6 6     6          .       i&#13;
ment-as well as domestic funds. In 1990-95 the stock market&#13;

market capitalization (table 5.3).&#13;
Stock market development is closely related to economic           .               ..                 -&#13;
development. In the initial stages of economic development,&#13;
commercial banks tend to dominate the financial system. As&#13;
economies grow, specialized financial intermediaries and equity&#13;
miiarkets develop. The rieason? Many profitable investmenits&#13;
require a long-term commitment of capital, but investors are tvp-&#13;
ically reluctant to relinquish control of their savings. By allowing&#13;
savers to acquire liquid assets, equity markets make investments&#13;
less risky and more attractive-and allow companies to tap cap-          6 -    6  - 6      S     -. . ..  a&#13;
ital for their longer-term investments. The development of stock  - -&#13;
markets also makes it easier for governments to sell off state-&#13;
owned enterprises.&#13;
But despite more than a decade of divestiture efforts, state   6 6 6&#13;
enterprises remain as ubiquitous in developing economies as&#13;
they were 20 years ago. Indeed, their presence has shrunk sig-&#13;
nificantly only in the former socialist economies and a few&#13;
middle-income countries. In most developing countries, partic-      -.-  -.. -&#13;
ularly the poorest, bureaucrats run as large a share of the econ-&#13;
omy as ever (table 5.4).                                                                  . -   6 &#13;
State enterprises often are less efficient than private firms,&#13;
and their deficits are typically financed in ways that undermine&#13;
macroeconomic stability. In addition, subsidies to state enter-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
prises often divert scarce funds from public spending on educa-&#13;
ticn and health. And because state enterprises tend to loom&#13;
large in low-income countries, they are likely to be most costly&#13;
in countries that can least afford them.&#13;
Privatizations of state enterprises in developing countries&#13;
generally have so far had more qualitative effects than quantita-&#13;
tihe effects-increased efficiency, more new domestic firms, and&#13;
a proven government commitinent to private sector develop-&#13;
ment. And even though sales have yet to generate much rev-&#13;
ernue, public enterprises are accruing fewer losses than they&#13;
once did.&#13;
Getting the incentives rfght&#13;
If the private sector is to lead economic growth, incentives must&#13;
be in place to increase private investment, boost the productiv-&#13;
ity of private firms, and spur competition. Perhaps even more&#13;
important is removing constraints to private sector develop-&#13;
ment. Distorted incentive policies call for reforms that address&#13;

;                        ~~~~~~~~Openness to trade goes hanid in hand with faster economic&#13;
growth. Many developing economies have been lowering their&#13;
tariffs and reducing the coverage of nontariff barriers, with fuir-&#13;
ther progress expected now that the Uruguay Round is coming&#13;
irto force. But tariffs are still high in many countries, in part&#13;
tbecause the countries need the revenues tariffs generate. For&#13;
example, tariffs in South Asia averaged 30 percent after the&#13;
U.ruguay Round, substantially lower than in the 1980s, but still&#13;
rnuch higher than those in East Asia (around 12 percent).&#13;
Industrial country tariffs now average around 3 percent (see&#13;
table 6.4). As countries develop, they usually build up their&#13;
capacity to tax residents direcdy, and indirect taxes become less&#13;
important as a source of revenue. Thus the share of direct taxes&#13;
in total revenues is one measure of the development of the tax&#13;
system.&#13;
Openness to foreign competition, foreign knowledge, and&#13;
loreign resources energizes the development process in many&#13;
ways, and lowering trade taxes enhances openness. The fastest-&#13;

The network of econornic links binding nations has become stronger in the past four&#13;
decades. World trade has grown faster than GDP. Foreign investment has increased&#13;
rapidly. International financial markets have expanded enormously in their scale and in&#13;
the diversity of their instrturments. And new technologies have revolutionized international&#13;
communications and altered long-standing patterns of production and employment. All&#13;
a striking contrast to the first half of the century, when *wars, autarky, and depression impeded&#13;
the growth of trade and international finance.&#13;
In some ways the pasi- four decades can be viewed as a return to the pre-1913 era-&#13;
when goods, labor, and capital moved around the world relatively freely. But there also are&#13;
striking differences. Compared with the reign of commodities before 1913, trade now has&#13;
a higher share of manufactures and services, in part a reflection of the declining price of&#13;
commodities relative to rnanufactures. Other differences between the current period of&#13;
financial integration and that of the late 19th century are the greater global scope and&#13;
depth of integration and the speed with which the market can now react.&#13;
Global economic integration-the wvidening and intensifying of links between the&#13;
economies of industrial and developing countries-has accelerated rapidly. Underpinning&#13;
the intensification of these links-which include trade, finance, investment, technology,&#13;
and migration-are several structural factors. The progressive liberalization of trade poli-&#13;
cies negotiated during consecutive rounds of trade talks-culminating in the Uruguay&#13;
Round-has lowered tariffs and stimulated trade. The integration of the world economy&#13;
through trade has been reinforced by increases in private capital flows, particularly in the&#13;
1990s. And technological advances in transport and communications have lowered the&#13;
cost of operating globally and provided developing countries with new opportunities to&#13;
benefit from the growing world economy.&#13;
Despite a brief reversal in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the global economic enNi-&#13;
ronment has become increasingly favorable, with expanding opportunities for developing&#13;
countries that have adopted an outward orientation. This environment has been charac-&#13;
terized by buoyant growth in industrial cotntries, low world inflation and energy prices,&#13;
and modest real interest rates (table 6a).&#13;
The principal beneficiaries of economic integration have been a few larger and more&#13;
rapidly growving developing economies, while the poorer and more slowly developing&#13;
economies remain heavily dependent on official aid flows from high-income countries.&#13;
These poorer economies typically are also less diversified and more dependent on exports&#13;
of primary commodities to high-income economies-and vulnerable to price fluctuations&#13;
in global markets.&#13;
This section provides information on the links between the high-income, industrial&#13;
economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and&#13;
low- and middle-income economies-focusing on trade, private and official capital flows,&#13;
and labor migration.&#13;
Disparities in global integration&#13;
Over the past decade the ratio of trade to GDP, a common measure of integration,&#13;
has risen-strongly in such regions as East Asia and Europe and Central Asia (table&#13;
6.1). The amount of foreign direct investment flowing to developing and transition&#13;
economies has increased fourfold, raising the ratio of FDI to GDP in some regions.&#13;
But there are wide disparities: the ratio of trade to GDP fell in many economies, espe-&#13;
ciallv in Africa, and rose only slightly in South Asia. The distribution of FDI across&#13;

For many developing countries successful&#13;
integration depends on fundamental economic&#13;
reform, requiring difficult policy decisions that&#13;
often lead to real short-term dislocation. These&#13;
costs must be acknowledged from the outset,&#13;
and the effects carefully taken into account in&#13;
the design of reform programs. But the costs&#13;
are manageable. In fact, openness to exter-&#13;
nal trade and investment is often the neces-&#13;
sary first step to solid, sustainable economic&#13;
development.&#13;

9 percent to 37 percent. Partly as a result of&#13;
European integration initiatives, trade in manu-&#13;
factures between the European Union (EU) and&#13;
deve oping countries grew at a below-average&#13;
pace. n 1995 on y about 18 percent of EU&#13;
imports of manufactures originated in non-OECD&#13;
countries. Labor-intensive products have been&#13;
among the most clynamic categories of manu-&#13;

roughly doubled their market share in high-income&#13;

this share had fallen to about 30 percent of&#13;
ODA commitments by DAC donors in 1993-94.&#13;
Because contributions to multilateral organi-&#13;
zations take the form of capital subscriptions&#13;
or outright grants, the decline in these contri-&#13;
butions has affected the distribution of ODA&#13;
commitments between loans and grants.&#13;
The proportion of untied aid has increased.&#13;
Aid that is tied obliges recipients to purchase&#13;
goods and services from the donor country or&#13;
from a specified group of countries. Partially&#13;
untied aid allows procurement from the donororII                I&#13;
country and most developing countries. Untied&#13;
aid has no such restrictions. Tying arrange-&#13;
ments may be justified on the grounds that          percent&#13;
they prevent a recipient from  misappropriat-        100&#13;
ing or mismanaging aid receipts-they may             90&#13;
help to keep targeted aid on target. But to the      80&#13;
extent that they prevent recipients from obtain-&#13;
ing the best value for their money, they reduce      70&#13;
the value-and thus the efficiency-of the aicl&#13;
received.                                            50&#13;

and through the IMF Trust Fund. Low-income coun-&#13;
tries that face protracted balarce of payments prob-&#13;
lems are eligible for ESAF funcs.&#13;
The regional development banks also maintain con-&#13;
cessional, or soft loan, windows for funds. But the&#13;
identity of these funds is not consistently recorded&#13;
in the DRS. The tabulation off ows from these insti-&#13;
tutions as concessional and nonconcessional is there-&#13;
fore based on the Development Assistance Committee&#13;
(DAC) definition. Under the DAC definition, conces-&#13;
sional flows contain a grant element of at least 25&#13;
percent. The grant element of loans is evaluated&#13;
assuming a nominal, market interest rate of 10 per-&#13;
cent. The grant element of a loan carrying a 10 per-&#13;
cent interest rate is nil, and for a grant, which requires&#13;
no repayment, it is 100 percent. (See the notes to&#13;
table 6.8 for further discussion of lending terms and&#13;
the calculation of the grant elernent.) In some cases&#13;
nonconcessional loans by these institutions may be&#13;
on terms that meet the DAC iefinition of conces-&#13;
sional; thus the figures here n ay not match tabula-&#13;
tions based on other definitions.&#13;

            This redesigned volume of the World
            Development Indicators (WDI), which selects indicators
            reflecting a broader, more integrated approach to
            development, is divided into five main sections: human
            capital development, environmental sustainability,
            macroeconomic performance, private sector development, and
            the global links influencing the external environment for
            development. Previously appendixed to the World Development
            Report, the WDI assumes the role of the World Bank s
            principal statistical survey of world development. It
            contains most of the data previously published in the
            Bank's "World Tables" and "Social
            Indicators of Development." Unlike the "World
            Tables," which presented tables for each economy
            containing long time series of macroeconomic data, WDI
            follow a cross-sectional format, with tables arranged
            topically. Most tables show indicators for a recent year and
            an earlier year, covering 148 economies with populations of
            more than one million. Where possible, the indicators are in
            growth rates or shares, a format designed to facilitate
            comparative analysis of important economic trends across
            countries and over time. Detailed technical notes accompany
            each set of indicators. Where difficulties are known in
            collecting and reporting data, warnings are provided in
            general or in specific footnotes to the tables. Data found
            unreliable or seriously deviating from accepted norms has
            been omitted. The indicators selected were those available
            for most of the principal economies.
