ANNEX 1&#13;
Descriptionof ctivities and Ext enditures and Governance Arrangements under&#13;
the Souih Asia Wite r In tiative Phase-2 Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
This Annex s'lall be ap plic ble to and form an integral part of all agreements&#13;
entered into between the Banl&lt; an I entities (collectively, the "Donors") that provide&#13;
contributions (the aggregate of  11 c.ntributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to&#13;
be administered by the Bank bar the Trust Fund.&#13;
A. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVI IES&#13;
The Project Developne at (lbjective is to increase regional cooperation in the&#13;
mariagement of the Himalayan Riv:-r systems to deliver sustainable, fair and inclusive&#13;
development and climate resilience.&#13;
(i)   Ba k-Execut,-d,Tru!,t Fund Activities:&#13;
SAWI will support activities relating to the management of river basins rising in&#13;
the Greater Himalayas, in the co intr: es of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India,&#13;
Nepal and Pakistan. The program will be structured around five key Focus Areas: the&#13;
Ganges Basin, the Brahmaputra Ba. in, the Indus Basin, the Sundarbans Landscape, and&#13;
Regional Cooperation. Speci:ic outp its and the outcomes to which they contribute will be&#13;
iderlified in the Focus AreE Sirate)ries at the basin, sub-basin/landscape, and regional&#13;
levels. At the Program level there will be two inter-related components:&#13;
Component 1: Building Coof erztion and Governance&#13;
Systematic dialogue (e.g., policy aiid practice debates engaging governments, opinion-&#13;
makers, civil society, privale ,ectc r and media) will be facilitated on transboundary&#13;
opportunities and policy developm nt at the regional and national levels, and among&#13;
development partners. Effor s will :e made to reach out to women and disadvantaged&#13;
groups in order to ensure that c )ncerns and opportunities relating to gender and&#13;
inclusiveness are identifie. The se dialogues will lead to improved common&#13;
understanding, better priority ,ettig, greater stakeholder ownership of interventions,&#13;
enabled policy environments. and ca.1s for action.&#13;
Learning: Capacity Building. Prioritized shared learning activities will be delivered to&#13;
build capacity and skills, and tc off,-r opportunities for regional practitioners to develop&#13;
de f1acto networks of practice. F articularly in fragile states, SAWI will support activities&#13;
to enhance the capacity of officials and other stakeholders to manage water (e.g., flood&#13;
forecasting, institutional deve-lopment, basin modeling) and to engage in transboundary&#13;
activities (e.g., international water law, negotiations.) These efforts will contribute to&#13;
more effective engagement on trar sboundary issues, better management practices and&#13;
more successful implementation of r elated activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-5-&#13;
Component 2: Supporting KrowledEe and Investments&#13;
Knowledge: Analysis and Pc licy Dt velopment. High quality, policy relevant knowledge&#13;
bases will be built in at least thrce important basins or landscapes. The process of&#13;
knowledge developirent and Jisscmination will be emphasized to ensure quality,&#13;
ownership and uptake, and S kVWI di alogues will be used as key platforms for knowledge&#13;
sharing. Accessibility (e.g., cpe:i ac.ess data platforms) will also be emphasized. These&#13;
effoits will contribute to m:re informed policy debates, greater legitimacy of&#13;
positions/decision taken and betier d,-signed interventions.&#13;
Action: Investment Design, Five genuine transboundary reform processes and/or&#13;
investments will be supportOd. Gr( at potential exists in the region for transboundary&#13;
cooperation on water resources rela:ed opportunities and risks at different levels: at the&#13;
regional (e.g., hydro meteorcilot:ical information, disaster risk management, hydropower&#13;
development), river basin (e.g., intcgrated river basin management, conjunctive use of&#13;
surface and groundwater, se dirent management) and landscape levels (e.g., glaciers,&#13;
mangroves). These actions m ou .d contribute to greater sustainability and productivity of&#13;
rivers and ecosystems, the prctect on of lives and livelihoods against disasters, and&#13;
enhanced resilience to climal e c hani ;e. Potentially, these efforts could also help diminish&#13;
regional tensions around tran.,;bounda Lry waters.&#13;
(ii)   Re$ipient-Exocuted [rust Fund Activities:&#13;
Supporting the client cointri -s in specific activities to be carried out in line with&#13;
enhancing their capacity and in coniributing to the SAWI-2 objectives, including: pilots,&#13;
capacity building, study tours, resezrch grants, show cases, exchange of knowledge and&#13;
best practice on specific issues relev; nt to SAWI-2.&#13;
