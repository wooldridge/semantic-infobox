&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success&#13;
factorsâ&#128;&#153; selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the African&#13;
Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;

&#13;
The architecture of the water supply and sanitation              anticipated capital investments are close to requirements,&#13;
subsectors in Kenya has undergone significant change             this assumes households will meet a substantial share of&#13;
in the last decade, in response to a slow deterioration of       costs, especially in rural areas. However, there is currently&#13;
urban services through the 1980s and â&#128;&#153;90s. Initiated with        no clear policy on promotion and marketing to encourage&#13;
a new Water Act in 2002, significant policy revision and         households to invest in sanitation.&#13;
restructuring of institutional roles is still ongoing and will&#13;
need to be aligned with the new Constitution of Kenya            Significant improvements can still be made throughout the&#13;
2010. Most of the reform emphasis has been in the water          â&#128;&#152;service delivery pathwayâ&#128;&#153; through which finance is turned&#13;
supply subsectors, especially urban, but sanitation is now       into services. Upstream, separation and clarification of roles&#13;
regaining emphasis with a new policy published in 2007           is incomplete for all subsectorsâ&#128;&#148;especially rural and urban&#13;
and a strategy and investment plan in development. These         sanitationâ&#128;&#148;including for governance, regulation, ownership,&#13;
reforms of the enabling environment are beginning to yield       and operations. Levels of disbursement and expenditure can&#13;
impacts in the coverage and quality of services. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s         still be improved to make the most of increased allocations&#13;
challenge is to finalize the reform of enabling aspects          to the sector from donors and government.&#13;
such as strategies and investment plans, further clarifying&#13;
roles and responsibilities, at the same time as significantly    Among policy issues, public support for sanitation hardware&#13;
scaling up resources and systems for implementing the            vs. software must be clarified. While finance for a national&#13;

If rates of progress on water supply and sanitation coverage     funding to subsidize sanitation.&#13;
are not accelerated, sector targets in Kenya will be missed&#13;
in both rural and urban areas. The biggest overall gaps          Moving downstream, aspects for sustaining and developing&#13;
are for rural and urban sanitation, and at current rates of      services are comparatively underdeveloped. The equity of&#13;

currently lower than it was in 1990, though there are signs      adequate management systems, finance and capacity to&#13;
that this downward trend is reversing. Progress has been         monitor, maintain, and expand services.&#13;
made in rural water supply but will need to be accelerated&#13;
to meet sector targets.                                          In urban areas, water supply and sanitation and sewerage&#13;

For water supply, financial allocations to the main              and equity, with an increasing risk of raw water shortage&#13;
sector ministry have increased six-fold since 2003/04,           due to lags in developing storage, transmission mains, and&#13;
while development partner contributions have almost              treatment capacity.&#13;

anticipated capital investment suggest that urban water          Finally, in terms of checks and balances, while the&#13;
supply has sufficient funds for water supply infrastructure,     monitoring and evaluation architecture is elaborate, greater&#13;
but additional funding needs for urgent water storage            use of the findings captured by information systems and&#13;
and bulk transfer schemes will require consideration.            reports is needed to drive performance improvements. The&#13;
Anticipated capital investment for rural water supply falls      second AMCOW Country Status Overview (CSO2) has been&#13;
short of requirements and is highly fragmented, making it        produced in collaboration with the Government of Kenya&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Align the Water Act 2002 with the Constitution of Kenya 2010.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Improve management and coordination of works and investment planning.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Enhance targeting of investments by developing and implementing a database to monitor coverage/functionality of&#13;
       rural water supply systems.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Raise funds to reduce the deficit, especially for multivillage bulk supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Agree on final placement of water services assets.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Intensify focus on informal settlements.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Raise funds for storage and transmission projects critical to secure water resources to cope with existing demand and&#13;
     future expected urban growth.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Enforce adherence to corporate governance principles set out by the regulator.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Complete the sanitation strategy ensuring it:&#13;
  	    o	 takes a clear stand on hardware subsidies and incorporates this into a subsector costing;&#13;
  	    o	 specifies clear roles for and makes full use of the 6000+ environmental health workers for sanitation and hygiene&#13;
          promotion;&#13;
  	    o	 puts in place a mechanism for monitoring uptake; and&#13;
  	    o	 addresses vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Ensure the sanitation strategy outlines the role of environmental health workers in urban areas; addresses the high&#13;
     degree of shared sanitation, especially among tenants; and improves coordination among responsible ministries.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Identify and invest in low-cost sewerage options including small-bore sewerage and decentralized, neighborhood-&#13;
     based treatment plants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                       3&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in&#13;
collaboration with the Government of Kenya and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

The most recent official estimates of access from the          percentage points (Figure 1). For sanitation, the JMP trend&#13;
Government of Kenya put water supply coverage at 42            line portrays access increasing from 26 percent in 1990 to&#13;
percent and sanitation coverage at 31 percent in 2006          31 percent in 2008. Figure 1 shows that this is in line with&#13;
(urban and rural areas combined). The chances of meeting       the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 2006 estimate, but less than half way to&#13;
ambitious government targets for 2015, of 76 percent           the MDG target of 63 percent.&#13;
in each case, appear slim.3 The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s estimates&#13;
and targets are taken from the Sector Investment Plan          Investment Requirements: Testing the&#13;
(SIP 2030),4 which forms the focus of the CSO2 report in       Sufficiency of Finance&#13;
assessing the adequacy of coverage trends and finance.&#13;
The SIPâ&#128;&#153;s definition of water supply coverage is stringent,    Past rates of coverage will need to be accelerated with&#13;
revising 2006 household survey results downwards on the        additional finance. The costings presented here are those&#13;
basis of quality and proximity of water supplies.5             developed by the Government of Kenya in its Sector&#13;

The CSO2 also benchmarks countriesâ&#128;&#153; own estimates              The SIM estimates of capital investment requirements&#13;

For water supply, the JMP estimates are more positive,         CAPEX and the assumed contribution from households,&#13;

The SIM suggests anticipated CAPEX is sufficient for                        For sanitation capital (â&#128;&#152;hardwareâ&#128;&#153;), total annual investment&#13;

US$303 million per year, of which US$246 million per year                   areas (user contributions of 5 percent for on-site sanitation&#13;
is expected to come from public finance.7 As per the SIM,                   and 100 percent for sewerage). This means that, overall,&#13;
this assumes that around 25 percent of the capital costs                    US$108 million per year is expected from public finance.&#13;

that while there is sufficient finance for capital at the                   in development. Anticipated public investment of around&#13;
sector level, disaggregating urban and rural subsectors                     US$100 million per year has been identified for sanitation,&#13;

that O&amp;M costs will be recovered from users, though in&#13;
practice this is not always achieved. If any annual O&amp;M&#13;
requirement has to be subsidized from the public purse,          and sanitation, rather than water resource management,&#13;
for example to utilities that do not achieve operational         raw water availability is an important consideration.&#13;

Another major reason for caution is the ineffectiveness of       develop additional water storage and transfer, up to&#13;

that households will contribute 95 percent of capital            the costing models can, of course, increase or decrease&#13;
costs, but the state still has a duty to safeguard public        the investment requirements. The SIM technology mix is&#13;

3.	 Reform Context:&#13;
	 Introducing the CSO2 Scorecard&#13;
&#13;
Water supply and, to a lesser extent, sanitation in Kenya       in 1999, but the resulting strategy to operationalize the&#13;
have undergone significant reforms since the â&#128;&#153;90s, when         policy was not developed until 2007, followed by a SIP&#13;
it became clear that the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ambitious long-           in 2009.12 The sanitation subsector is somewhat behind:&#13;
term targets, set in the early â&#128;&#153;80s, would not be reached.      an environmental sanitation and hygiene policy was&#13;
This recent history puts the service delivery pathway in        published in 2007, and the accompanying strategy and&#13;
context, which can then be explored in detail using the         investment plan are in development.13 However, several of&#13;
CSO2 scorecard, an assessment tool providing a snapshot         the enabling reforms initiated with the 2002 Act present&#13;
of reform progress across the â&#128;&#152;building blocksâ&#128;&#153; that make       ongoing challenges, including embedding the Sector-Wide&#13;
up the service delivery pathway. The CSO2 scorecard             Approach (SWAp) adopted in 2006. Furthermore, with the&#13;
assesses the building blocks of service delivery in turn:       enactment of the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the Water&#13;
three building blocks which relate to enabling services;        Act 2002 will need to be reviewed to be brought into line&#13;
three which relate to developing new services; and three        with the new supreme law.&#13;
which relate to sustaining services. Each building block is&#13;
assessed against specific indicators and scored from 1 to       Further along the service delivery pathway, key challenges&#13;
3 accordingly.11                                                to developing new services efficiently include the need&#13;
                                                                for criteria to match resource allocation at national level&#13;
By the â&#128;&#153;90s, sector performance in Kenya had                    with need at local level; and for systems to monitor&#13;
deteriorated, particularly in urban areas, exacerbated          output more effectively. The final, downstream end&#13;
by the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s limited funding to the sector, poor         of the service delivery pathway relates to sustaining&#13;
management of utilities, mismanagement of funds, and            servicesâ&#128;&#148;as Figure 3 indicates Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s subsectors&#13;

however, only became a significant impetus for change&#13;

Macroeconomic reform initiatives promoted by bilateral          delivery pathway, and peer-group comparison&#13;
agencies and international finance institutions also played&#13;
a part in catalyzing reform.                                                                  Enabling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To date, reform effort has concentrated â&#128;&#152;upstreamâ&#128;&#153; in the&#13;
service delivery pathwayâ&#128;&#148;on the enabling environment&#13;
for service delivery. Figure 3 indicates that Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
enabling building blocks score well against its peer group,&#13;
reflecting extensive policy and planning reforms as well&#13;
as strong budget allocation. Much of this arose with a&#13;
new Water Act in 2002, giving rise to a new set of Water&#13;

maximize efficiency. Related scorecard indicators, which           tariff reviews and determinations is yet to be fully exercised.&#13;

Regulation: Empowering WASREB. While several                       supply and sewerage assets from the MoWI, local&#13;
promising initiatives have emerged from WASREB, such as            authorities (LAs), the National Water Conservation and&#13;

In Kenya, the M&amp;E architecture is elaborate and has            The WASREBâ&#128;&#153;s two Impact Reports have set a promising&#13;

monitoring towards an integrated sectorwide monitoring         and its information system, WARIS, has consolidated data&#13;
system. Scorecard indicators relating to M&amp;E are found         on WSB and WS provider performance, including Key&#13;
throughout the service delivery pathway, from the              Sector Indicators. However, the broader picture shows&#13;
presence of an annual review (for which Kenya scores well)     that strong links within and between different stages of&#13;
to the monitoring of output and consistency of household       the M&amp;E cycle are not yet in place. Over the past two years&#13;

architecture in Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s water, sanitation, and hygiene         The Annual Sector Review provides a useful forum for&#13;

use of allocation criteria to target funds: in Kenya this is&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Kenya :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The architecture of the water supply and
            sanitation subsectors in Kenya has undergone significant
            change in the last decade, in response to a slow
            deterioration of urban services through the 1980s and
            '90s. Initiated with a new water act in 2002,
            significant policy revision and restructuring of
            institutional roles is still ongoing and will need to be
            aligned with the new Constitution of Kenya 2010. Most of the
            reform emphasis has been in the water supply subsectors,
            especially urban, but sanitation is now regaining emphasis
            with a new policy published in 2007 and a strategy and
            investment plan in development. These reforms of the
            enabling environment are beginning to yield impacts in the
            coverage and quality of services. Kenya's challenge is
            to finalize the reform of enabling aspects such as
            strategies and investment plans, further clarifying roles
            and responsibilities, at the same time as significantly
            scaling up resources and systems for implementing the
            development of new services on the ground. Finally, in terms
            of checks and balances, while the monitoring and evaluation
            architecture is elaborate, greater use of the findings
            captured by information systems and reports is needed to
            drive performance improvements. The African Ministers
            Council on Water (AMCOW) Second Country Status Overview
            (CSO2) has been produced in collaboration with the
            Government of Kenya and other stakeholders.
