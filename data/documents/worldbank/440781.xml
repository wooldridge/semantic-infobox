REPUBLIC OF CHAD&#13;
HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:           Republic of Chad&#13;
Implementing&#13;
Agency:             Agency for Household Energy and Environment (AEDE)&#13;
Beneficiaries:      Ministry of Mines, Energy and Petroleum (MMEP)&#13;
Ministry of Environment and Water Resources (MEE)&#13;
Rural and Urban Households&#13;
Amount:             SDR 4.0 million (US$5.27 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:              Standard IDA terms, with 40 year maturity, including 10 years grace&#13;
Project Objectilves. The key objective of the project is to provide an economic and&#13;
sustainable supplly of energy for households. Least cost supply and sustainability are being&#13;
achieved througlh a community based participatory approach and environmental awareness.&#13;
The specific objectives of the project are to: (i) promote the establishment of the sustainable&#13;
production of woodfuel in selected villages providing energy to the capital, N'Djamena; (ii)&#13;
strengthen the capacity of the Borrower to extend such production elsewhere; (iii) carry out&#13;
institutional reforms in the household energy sector; and (iv) improve efficiency in the use of&#13;
household energy.&#13;
Project Description: The project comprises four components that will be implemented over&#13;
four years: (a) establishing village-based natural resource management; (b) monitoring and&#13;
control of wood product flows; (c) improvement in the efficiency of household fuel use; and&#13;
(d) project management which includes capacity building and training. On the supply side,&#13;
which accounts for about 80% of project costs, simple long-term village-based land-use and&#13;
wood exploitation plans will be prepared for the N'Djamena wood fuel catchment area; these&#13;
plans are based on an assessment of wood resources, and economic activities in the&#13;
surroundings of the villages, focusing on a more rational and participatory approach to&#13;
management of wood resources. Efficient charcoal conversion techniques will also be&#13;
promoted in those areas where charcoal is produced. A system will be established to monitor&#13;
the inflow of wood products from rural production zones into N'Djamena. An effective&#13;
environmental policy instrument guiding transporters towards areas where least-cost wood is&#13;
available will be implemented. On the demand side, the commercialization of efficient&#13;
cooking stoves by private agents will account for about 20 percent of project costs; suitable&#13;
stove models will be identified through NGOs and a promotional campaign will be launched&#13;
to encourage the private sector to adopt the program. The project will also promote the&#13;
commercialization of low-cost kerosene and LPG stoves by private agents and seek ways to&#13;
increase the efficiency of their supply system.&#13;
&#13;

Project Benefits: The main benefits for the project are to ensure a sustainable supply of&#13;
economic household fuels and to prevent agricultural productivity losses from the&#13;
environmental degradation caused by the unregulated clear cutting of wood. Other benefits,&#13;
include the improvement of rural incomes by charging rural communities with the&#13;
responsibility of managing and commercializing the wood resources in their areas. The&#13;
additional incomes will be particularly significant for the poorer rural households in the wood-&#13;
producing areas. The main quantifiable benefit of introducing efficient cooking equipment is&#13;
the financial savings due to a reduction of cooking fuel use. Other benefits are the decrease of&#13;
the negative health impacts of using traditional stoves and a reduction of CO2 emissions.&#13;
Risks: Three risks exist: (a) the commitment of communities to effectively implement the&#13;
wood management plans; (b) the efficiency of the system for controlling and monitoring wood&#13;
entries in N'Djamena which might be diminished by fraud and non-cooperation of certain&#13;
actors (esp. the military); and (c) the social obstacles which might arise from the wood fuel&#13;
fiscal reform required to introduce economic pricing, namely the need to levy a wood fuel&#13;
surcharge (equivalent to a user fee) to bring market price in line with the opportunity cost of&#13;
wood fuels. These risks will be minimized through: (i) the up-front commitment on the part&#13;
of Government to proceed with the proposed reforms, as has already been demonstrated by&#13;
the enactment of the forestry law; (ii) the anticipated strong commitment of local communities&#13;
to manage the available resources in their surroundings; (iii) the design of a simple and&#13;
transparent system to monitor and control wood fuels; (iv) an awareness campaign on the use&#13;
of more efficient stoves; (v) the participatory approach to project design and implementation;&#13;
and (vi) the limited role of Government in project implementation combined with the&#13;
emphasis on capacity building for public, private, communal, and NGO stakeholders.&#13;

HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT&#13;
1. PROJECT SETTING AND RATIONAL&#13;
PROJECT'S CONRIBUTION TO POVERTY REDUCTION, ENvIRONMENTAL PROTECTION,&#13;
AND RURAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.1 The proposed Household Energy Project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy and the Environmental Action Plan, and directly supports four of the CAS main&#13;
objectives: Poverty alleviation, rural and private sector development, and environmental&#13;
protection. The project will generate income in rural areas, optimize the use of local wood&#13;
resources, and protect the long-term environmental sustainability and rural livelihood. Health&#13;
benefits will be obtained, particularly for women and children, through the use of more&#13;
efficient stoves. Finally, a reduction in the deforestation rate will yield global benefits in&#13;
terms of reduced carbon dioxide emissions.&#13;
1.2 The economy of Chad is in the process of reconstruction from the deleterious effects of&#13;
both domestic and international factors which have led to an erratic economic performance.&#13;
During most of the 1980s anned conflict destroyed significant infrastructure. This&#13;
destruction, combined with ineffective public resource management and drought hindered&#13;
economic growth. Structural reforms began in 1987 to address these problems and the key&#13;
elements of these reforms were consolidated public expenditure and improved performance of&#13;
the cotton sector. This program led to some improvement of economic growth which&#13;
averaged 3.8 percent during 1987-90. However, by the end of 1990, a political coup plunged&#13;
Chad into a period of renewed political and economic uncertainty.&#13;
1.3 Since 1990, sharp increases in military spending and the declining capacity of the GOC&#13;
to collect revenues severely constrained economic performance. In addition to domestic&#13;
problems, Chad faced two major external problems: (a) the appreciation of the real effective&#13;
exchange rate which led to major losses in the cotton sector; and (b) the decline in the world&#13;
price of cotton. By 1993, Chad's economic performance had diminished substantially with&#13;
growth in GDP declining by 3.7 percent. In addition to macroeconomic imbalances, the&#13;
management of public finances was a recurrent problem for Chad: tax collection was low,&#13;
only about 6 percent of fiscal receipts; a parallel market was circumventing the taxation&#13;
system; and the country's public administration was staffed by workers paid on an irregular&#13;
basis, with very little incentive for improving their performance.&#13;
1.4 Since 1993, the Government has taken some significant actions for economic recovery.&#13;
GOC, in consultation with member countries of the CFA zone in 1994, decided to change the&#13;
fixed parity of the CFA franc from CFAF 50 to 100 per French franc. The devaluation helped&#13;
make the country's major export products more competitive on the world market and reduce&#13;
external imbalances. At the same time as the parity adjustment, GOC launched a new&#13;
economic and social program to: reestablish order in public finance; correct macroeconomic&#13;
imbalances through improved revenue collection and reduced expenditures, improve&#13;
economic incentives for the agricultural sector; improve public investment performance and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

THE ENERGY SECTOR: DOMINANCE OF WOOD FUELS IN ENERGY BALANCE&#13;
1.5 Although petroleum was discovered in Chad over 25 years ago, it is yet to be produced&#13;
to meet Chad's own domestic needs for energy or for exports. This is likely to change,&#13;
however, if two petroleum projects, now under preparation, move forward. The first is the&#13;
development of a small oil field in the northwest part of the country at Sedigi, near Lake&#13;
Chad. The project would be majority private sector financed by a consortium of oil&#13;
companies consisting of Exxon, Shell and Elf. The oil would be transported in a pipeline to&#13;
N'Djamena, refined and sold for the domestic market only. The Sedigi project will provide&#13;
kerosene and LPG for household energy consumption and will support substitution away from&#13;
woodfuels. The other oil project is located in the southern part of Chad at Doba. This is a&#13;
large project for export being developed by the same members of the consortium. It involves:&#13;
(i) drilling of some 300 wells; (ii) construction of a 30," 1,050 km pipeline from Doba to&#13;
Cameroon's Atlantic coast at Kribi; and (iii) installation of an offshore export terminal facility&#13;
in Cameroon. The cost of the project is estimated at $3.5 billion and is expected to generate&#13;
about $2.5 billion in revenues for Chad (nearly doubling annuai fiscal revenues) and about&#13;
$500 million for Cameroon over the 25 years of production.&#13;
1.6 Chad's energy balance (Annex 1.1) reflects the country's early stage of economic&#13;
development. The economy's modem sector uses only a small portion of total net energy&#13;
supply, while households consume 92%, mostly in form of wood fuels for cooking. Wood&#13;
resources are mostly located in the south of the country where there is a heavy rainfall. The&#13;
total standing stock of wood from the country's trees has been estimated at 859 million tons,&#13;
or 344 million tons of oil equivalent (toe). Total sustainable annual wood yield from these&#13;
areas is 31 million tons or 12.4 million toe. Of this, on a yearly basis, only about 14 million&#13;
tons of wood are physically accessible to the population for use and this level of exploitation&#13;
is equivalent to about 5.6 million toe. However, the wood off-take is not evenly divided over&#13;
the available resources, resulting in over-exploitation in certain zones and under-exploitation&#13;
in others. In addition, unsustainable wood exploitation practices aggravate the impact on the&#13;
existing resources, resulting in a noticeable degradation of forested areas surrounding cities.&#13;
N'Djamena is a case in point where considerable damage has already occurred to the&#13;
surrounding wood resources, and if not acted upon soon, the sustainable supply of wood fuels&#13;
will be in danger.&#13;
ENERGY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS&#13;
1.7 There are three GOC ministries that are responsible for supervising the country's energy&#13;
sector. The Ministry of Mines, Energy and Petroleum (MMEP) oversees the overall technical&#13;
aspects of the energy sector. The Ministry of Environment and Water Resources (MEE)&#13;
supervises forest and water resources and the environment. The Ministry of Commerce and&#13;
Industry (MCI) monitors the activities of the oil companies and is responsible for setting&#13;
electricity tariffs and the prices of petroleum products. There are also several other entities&#13;
operating in electricity and petroleum subsectors.&#13;

1.8 In the petroleum subsector, GOC has set up the SEERAT (Societi d'etude et&#13;
d'exploitation de la raffinerie du Tchad), which is owned 49 percent by GOC and 51 percent&#13;
by a consortium of'three international oil companies, Exxon (operator), Shell, and Elf. The&#13;
purpose of SEERA4T is to carry out the feasibility study for the proposed pipeline and oil&#13;
refinery, and be responsible for its construction and operation, if the investment project is&#13;
considered economically, financially and statistically viable. The Doba oil project, located in&#13;
Southern Chad, is currently managed by a negotiating team comprising representatives of&#13;
various institutions interested in the implementation and exploitation of this large scale&#13;
project.&#13;
1.9 The STEE (Societe tchadienne d'eau et d'dlectricite') is responsible for the production&#13;
and distribution ol' electricity and water in the country. This company is a partnership&#13;
between GOC (81.3% ownership) and the Caisse Frangaise de Developpement (18.7%&#13;
ownership).&#13;
THE BANK'S ROLE IN THE ENERGY SECTOR AND LESSONS AND PRINCIPLES&#13;
INCORPORATED IN PROJECT DESIGN&#13;
1.10 This will be the first time IDA is involved in household energy sector in Chad. IDA's&#13;
experience with comparable household energy projects in other African countries has been&#13;
favorable and several projects are underway. A Best Practice paper I on this was approved in&#13;
July 1996 by the 'World Bank's Policy Committee. This document highlights the need for&#13;
devolution of control over natural resources to local villages, in the same way as is proposed&#13;
for this project.&#13;
1.11 An IDA-supported household energy project in Niger has increased control over&#13;
fuelwood flows into Niamey (the Capital) from 10% to 60%, raising Government revenues to&#13;
over half a billion CFAF per year (about US$ I million), and led to the voluntary&#13;
establishment of over 50 rural fuelwood markets with a managed natural forest resource base&#13;
of some 160,000 ha. On the demand side, wood and kerosene stoves are being disseminated&#13;
via existing commercial channels. The response of the local population to the devolution of&#13;
control over forest resources has been extremely positive, and demand to participate in the&#13;
project outstrips the project team's capacity at this time. In Chad, the experience with&#13;
household energy has been encouraging, as witnessed by the preparation of a Detailed Action&#13;
Plan (DAP) and new legislation that allows considerable improvements to take place in this&#13;
field. DAP has mapped out the key concepts which formed the basis of this project. It has&#13;
also mapped out the next steps/strategy needed to ensure the sustainable availability of&#13;
biomass resources for energy consumption.&#13;
1.12 The project will incorporate the lessons of the Niger and other household or natural&#13;
resource management projects (i.e., in Burkina Faso and Mali), as well as from the Bank-&#13;
financed Review of Policies in the Traditional Energy Sector (RPTES) study. Lessons learnt&#13;
will be incorporated from the Bank's substantial experience with household energy demand&#13;

1.13 The Agricultural Services Project (TD-PA-501) in Chad provides extension services to&#13;
farmers and establishes a better environment for agricultural research, but it is not specifically&#13;
designed to address wood issues. However, its infrastructure for extension may be an effective&#13;
vehicle to raise rural awareness about natural resource management.&#13;
1.14 Chad will require external, financial, and technical assistance to bring about the&#13;
necessary institutional and legal reforms for better resource management and efficiency. IDA&#13;
has the capability to provide this assistance because of its broad experience with household&#13;
energy issues in other countries of the Africa region. Finally, IDA's active participation in the&#13;
project is critical to mobilize needed additional financial resources from donors to replicate&#13;
similar activities around other urban areas and to facilitate coordination between the different&#13;
and potential actors active in this field in Chad.&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
1 .15 One of the objectives of the project is to develop a durable solution for the wood fuel&#13;
supply of the Capital. Levels of income need to rise sufficiently so that urban households can&#13;
afford to switch from wood fuels to modem cooking fuels such as kerosene and LPG. The&#13;
project will ensure that until such level is reached, the wood fuel supply and demand balance&#13;
is positive. Thus improved wood fuel management is an essential component in achieving&#13;
sustainability by meeting the growing energy needs of urban population, maintaining their&#13;
standard of living and protecting the long-term reproductive capacity of woodlands while&#13;
ensuring that rural communities livelihoods are secure as well.&#13;

2. HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
OVERVIEW&#13;
2.1 Household energy demand is driven by rural and urban consumers, though it is the later&#13;
which exerts considerable influence on wood fuel management practices. Fuelwood&#13;
availability and its sustainable management is not a problem in most rural areas of Chad as&#13;
communal based management systems have been in place and have functioned relatively well&#13;
for decades. The majority of rural people reside in areas of limited biomass cover. As long as&#13;
population densities are low, sustainable management is achievable. When wood fuel demand&#13;
increases due to increasing population densities in urban areas, sustainable wood fuel&#13;
management is threatened in areas of limited biomass cover.&#13;
2.2 Urban areas consume a relatively small percentage of the total annual fuelwood&#13;
consumption in comparison to rural areas. However, extraction methods used to meet the&#13;
growing urban demand for fuelwood are increasingly unsustainable. Illegal harvesting&#13;
activities have promoted land degradation through excessive loss of biomass cover and stand&#13;
to harm rural based economic activities such as agriculture and livestock. Many of these&#13;
illegal harvesters do not have a vested interest in the community and are part-time laborers&#13;
from other regions employed by powerful urban business interests. Continued over-&#13;
harvesting not only reduces environmental and economic sustainability but further enforces a&#13;
spiraling effect of continued and ever increasing degradation by marginalizing rural&#13;
populations, rendering land unproductive, and forcing farmers to use unsustainable&#13;
agricultural extensification (clearing of more land) to maintain household income. A case in&#13;
point is N'Djamena where the reduction of economic output for outlying areas is promoting&#13;
urban migration.&#13;
DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
2.3 Consumption3. Households account for most of the energy consumption in Chad and&#13;
about 880 thousand toe or 89 percent of the estimated national energy consumption in 1995&#13;
(Annex 1.1). Most of this consumption is for cooking which use wood fuels as the main&#13;
energy source. Rural areas, which consume about 75 percent of total household energy, rely&#13;
entirely on fuelwood for cooking. In 1990 in N'Djamena, 80% of the population used&#13;
fuelwood as the primary cooking fuel and as a primary fuel, charcoal was used by 16 percent&#13;
of the population and by 54 percent as a secondary fuel. In 1995, fuelwood use considerably&#13;
decreased to about 54 percent of the population. Charcoal demand has risen rapidly by 1995;&#13;
46 percent of the population used it as primary fuel and 35 percent used it as a secondary fuel.&#13;
The demand for kerosene and LPG gas for cooking is limited to about I percent of the&#13;
population in N'Djamena. Table 2.1 summarizes the structure of final energy consumption&#13;
3  Most of the information on household energy demand in Chad comes from a 1991 survey of&#13;
household energy use under the Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance Program.&#13;
The information on the urban sector covers the capital city N'Djamena, which accounts for almost&#13;
half of the urban household energy demand. The ESMAP survey assumes that other urban areas&#13;
have similar demand characteristics. Household energy use in 1995 and 1997 shows&#13;
characteristics very similar to the results obtained by the 1991 survey.&#13;
&#13;

for cooking by fuel for rural and urban areas. While this structure reflects 1990 data, no&#13;
significant changes have been observed in the contribution of biomass sources (fuelwood and&#13;
charcoal) to household energy consumption. Consumption of modern household fuels&#13;
(kerosene and LPG) has not increased significantly since 1990, largely because of high costs&#13;
and restricted availability.&#13;

2.4 Fuel Use Patterns. A consumption survey conducted in 1990 indicated that most&#13;
households use more than one fuel to satisfy their energy needs. Their choice of fuel depends&#13;
on two main factors: (a) the socioeconomic level of the household; and (b) the preferences of&#13;
the person in the household who does the cooking. In the low-income group, which accounts&#13;
for about 70 percent of all households, 87 percent of the households use fuelwood as the&#13;
principal fuel; 12 percent use charcoal; and less than 1 percent use LPG gas. Charcoal is used&#13;
as a major secondary fuel for about 86 percent of these households. For the middle-income&#13;
groups, about 45 percent use fuelwood as the principal fuel; 33 percent use charcoal; and 19&#13;
percent use LPG gas. For this group, charcoal is the main secondary fuel accounting for about&#13;
67 percent of secondary fuel used in those households that use multiple fuels. Most&#13;
householders find that the wood fires are better for preparing "boule" which is the basic&#13;
household meal. At the same time, there is a distinct preference in using charcoal to make&#13;
sauces and hot drinks.&#13;
2.5 According to the ESMAP survey, when fuelwood was used as a secondary energy source&#13;
instead of a primary energy source, the daily specific consumption of fuelwood declined by&#13;
about two-thirds from 0.65 kg per person to 0.21 kg per person. In contrast, a similar situation&#13;
for charcoal resulted in a specific-consumption decline of less than one third. This indicates&#13;
that households tend to use charcoal more for specific types of food. Another survey carried&#13;
out in 1995, indicated that charcoal had recently become equally important as fuelwood in&#13;
N'Djamena. Other African countries have experienced the same pattern due to urbanization.&#13;
As a result, overall wood consumption could increase dramatically, since charcoal use,&#13;
compared to fuelwood use, on a similar weight basis, embodies at least three times the amount&#13;
of wood resource use. The poorest section of the population estimated at 5 - 10 percent does&#13;
not purchase its fuel, but gathers it in the surroundings of N'Djamena.&#13;

2.6 Comparative Cost of Meal Preparation. The ESMAP study evaluated the comparative&#13;
costs of cooking a standard meal using various fuels and stoves according to market prices in&#13;
1991. The results indicated an overwhelming preference for the use of the traditional "three-&#13;
stone" open stove which has an efficiency of about 10 percent. The attachment to this type of&#13;
stove seems to have deep cultural roots since it is prevalent among middle-income groups as&#13;
well as lower income groups. At the time of the ESMAP survey, only 4 percent of households&#13;
were using "improved" stoves for fuelwood or charcoal. The average household had two or&#13;
three stoves, the principal one being the three-stone traditional stove for preparing the main&#13;
meal.&#13;
2.7 The ESMAP study produced several other relevant results: first, the use of charcoal in a&#13;
traditional stove was the least-cost cooking method, mainly because of the current low&#13;
charcoal price, which does not reflect the fuel's economic cost; second, not all stoves&#13;
designated as "improved " were necessarily more efficient than traditional stoves; and third,&#13;
among the modem fuels, only one type of kerosene stove was competitive with the traditional&#13;
"three-stone" fuelwood stove. Other stoves cost 50 percent more and the cost of meal&#13;
preparation with one type of LPG stove was more than twice of the three-stone stove.&#13;
2.8 Household Lxpenditures on Wood fuels. A typical household in N'Djamena using&#13;
fuelwood and charcoal as principal and secondary fuels, respectively, spends about CFAF&#13;
50,000 per year (1991 data) on fuel or about 4 percent of overall household expenditures and&#13;
56 percent on food. Although the level of cooking expense is an average, more than 80&#13;
percent of all households spend less than 10 percent of their budget on fuels and the poorest&#13;
percentile could spend between 10 - 19 percent.&#13;
2.9 Factors Affecting Stove Choice. When selecting a stove, consumers consider:&#13;
portability; stability; ease in lighting; rapid cooking time; efficiency; ability to accommodate a&#13;
large family; adaptability for the use of fuelwood or charcoal; and esthetic appearance. In&#13;
general, monetary factors account for 50 percent of stove choice, with greater emphasis on the&#13;
fuel price than on the price of the stove. However, in some cases, consumers do not&#13;
immediately perceive the efficiency benefits of using altemative stoves and fuels until they&#13;
receive specific information about them. Although firewood stoves can be obtained free of&#13;
cost (three stones), in urban areas households usually purchase their stove. To use charcoal a&#13;
stove is required. The type of stove used and the cook's prevailing cooking practices&#13;
determine his/her level of fuel consumption.&#13;
2.10 Improved Stoves. A good improved firewood stove can potentially save over 30 percent&#13;
of monthly expenditures compared to the traditional three-stone stove. An improved charcoal&#13;
stove can save 20 to 30 percent. Annual savings of about CFAF 10,000 or more are quite&#13;
feasible, which compares favorably with the prices for improved stoves, ranging from CFAF&#13;
1000 to CFAF 3000 for firewood stoves and CFAF 4,000 to 5,000 for charcoal stoves. This&#13;
results in a pay back period of less than six months. Improved stoves can thus effectively be&#13;
used to off-set future price increases of wood fuels. Despite this, not many households are&#13;
using improved stoves presently. The reasons for this include unfamiliarity with improved&#13;
stoves, poorly designed improved stove models, cultural practices, and/or cash flow problems.&#13;
2.1 1 Improved stoves could benefit the user and the country if good stove model(s) were&#13;
made available and accompanied by a systematic marketing effort. Even though an improved&#13;
stove may save fuel in laboratory tests, households may not wish to buy it on a large scale&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

even if it were commercially available. A household testing phase needs also to be&#13;
implemented before stoves are sold in the market. Experience in other countries (Burkina,&#13;
Kenya, Madagascar, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal) clearly suggest that once these initial steps are&#13;
taken, commercialization can reach good results.&#13;

WOOD FUELS SUPPLY&#13;
2.12 Forest Resources. The latest estimates of available wood resources are based on satellite&#13;
imagery (SPOT) data of 1995 (for the N'Djamena area only), with a comparative analysis of&#13;
past forestry records and a 1987 satellite data (Landsat Thematic Mapper). Annex 2.1&#13;
summarizes the results of this analysis. Total standing wood stock in Chad amounts to 859&#13;
million tons with an annual yield of about 31 million tons. Most of these resources are located&#13;
in the south of the country where rainfall is considerably higher than in the center or the north.&#13;
2.13 There are several factors limiting the reliability of current resource assessment: (a) the&#13;
absence of ground surveys to assess the standing volume; (b) insufficient correlation between&#13;
the forest resource data and the geographical distribution of the population and fuel-use&#13;
preferences; and (c) production estimates generally based on average regional&#13;
approximations. Furthermore, not all the estimated forest resources are accessible for wood&#13;
supply. The wood supply available to the population usually depends on the existence of&#13;
roads and trails that make it possible for woodcutters to enter and transport the wood. Taking&#13;
this into account, about 45 percent of annual forest production is available, amounting to 14&#13;
million tons of wood or 5.6 million toe. Thus further analysis is required to better estimate&#13;
wood supply in Chad.&#13;
2.14 Three distinctive zones provide wood fuels to N'Djamena: (a) the area to the north and&#13;
east, including the Reserve de Faune du Bas Chari, Massaguet, and the area north of the&#13;
N'Djamena - Dourbali - Massenya where degradation is the result of both agricultural&#13;
clearings and wood fuel supply; (b) the area south-east of N'Djamena, between the road to&#13;
Massenya and the Chari river, where forest fires are the main problem and wood fuels are not&#13;
produced on a large scale; and (c) the area south of N'Djamena, between the Chari and&#13;
Logone rivers, which has suffered most from woodland clearance. This area has the highest&#13;
population density which requires agricultural production to satisfy the daily needs. Also, the&#13;
main tarmac route to N'Djamena makes the transport of charcoal and firewood easy. Some&#13;
wood fuel is reportedly transported from as far as Sarh, 500 km upstream along the Chari&#13;
river during parts of the year.&#13;
2.15 Annex 2.1 shows the total productivity of the wood catchment area that supplies&#13;
N'Djamena with wood fuels. The total amount that can be harvested on an annual basis&#13;
without affecting the resource base is 535 thousand tons per year. Although this is more than&#13;
what is currently needed, reduction of the resource base is occurring. Not all areas are&#13;
accessible or actively harvested, making the effectively harvested area much smaller. In&#13;
reality, the wood off-take in a 10 - 20 km strip along easily accessible main roads is causing&#13;
severe deforestation as far as 100 km from N'Djamena. Fruit trees are cut with other types of&#13;
trees. The remaining trees do not give quality charcoal. As a result, plots of dry Sudanian&#13;
woodland and mnoist Acacia bush land are degraded to wooded grasslands or less.&#13;
2.16 Exploitation of Wood fuel Supplies. The informal private sector handles all wood&#13;
production and distribution in the wood fuels sector. In order to maximize profitability, illegal&#13;
fuelwood harvesters seek to exploit supplies near the capital without regard for maintaining a&#13;
sustainable supply. These actions not only occur on communal lands but also on privately&#13;
held land. These include non-timber, fruit trees, and acacias (used to produce gum arabic),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                  SAR - Household Energy Project&#13;
which many rural households are dependent upon for sources of their income. The rural&#13;
population has recently become involved in wood-cutting and charcoal making on a part-time&#13;
basis, after they observed how easily charcoalers earned money from resources belonging to&#13;
the villages.&#13;
2.17 While considerable resources are "potentially" available for exploitation, they are not&#13;
utilized as harvesters have no economic incentive to access these resources. The least cost&#13;
supply is the first utilized which compares to the easiest access. Supply availability is in large&#13;
part strictly a function of profitability. New supplies are only "made" available when pre-&#13;
existing available supplies have been exhausted beyond the point of economic return as well&#13;
as sustainable production. From a country perspective, total wood production may exceed&#13;
consumption, but localized production may not.&#13;
2.18 There is evidence that wood deficits and environmental degradation is developing in the&#13;
forested areas surrounding major urban centers. This will only intensify if inefficient land-use&#13;
and fuel-use practices in the current supply system continue. These practices include: (a) the&#13;
burning of large areas of forest for land-clearing by farmers and animal breeders who do not&#13;
take sufficient precautions against the spread of fire; (b) a system of administrative regulations&#13;
that does not encourage the sustainable offtake of wood and improvements in the efficiency of&#13;
charcoal production; and (c) consumer wastage of wood by not using efficient stoves. In&#13;
addition, charcoal making has become an important business with a total annual market value&#13;
of about US$6.8 million for the N'Djamena area alone. Current charcoaling methods and&#13;
practices are such that there is no consideration for the resource base: charcoal is made by&#13;
itinerant charcoalers (outsiders), who are often financed by urban transporters. They cut as&#13;
many suitable trees as possible to quickly produce charcoal and move on when there are no&#13;
longer sufficient easily accessible trees.&#13;
2.19 Charcoal Conversion. Charcoalers in Chad use the traditional earth mound kiln for the&#13;
carbonization process that transforms wood to charcoal. The estimated efficiency of this kiln&#13;
is about 13 percent4, as tested in the field in early 1995 under the PPF financed study. More&#13;
efficient kiln designs that are more labor-intensive than current methods and that require&#13;
better monitoring of the carbonization process can improve the efficiency to about 18 - 22&#13;
percent. Such gain in conversion efficiency implies primary wood savings of almost 40&#13;
percent.&#13;
2.20 Transport and distribution. Firewood and charcoal are transported to N'Djamena (1991)&#13;
by trucks and other motorized vehicles, as well as by non-motorized transport, mostly&#13;
donkeys, and barges that travel to various sales points along inland waterways.5 The&#13;
distribution network consists of 1,000 to 2,000 sales points in market areas, and street corners.&#13;
The number of these sales outlets fluctuates greatly since some operate only on a part-time or&#13;
seasonal basis. Between December and May, many sellers from rural areas come directly to&#13;
sell wood in N'Djamena. The sales outlets are fairly specialized: a little more than half sell&#13;
4  Efficiency defined as dry weight of charcoal obtained divided by dry weight of wood input.&#13;
5  According to a survey by the Bureau inter-ministeriel d 'tudes et de projets (BIEP), half of all&#13;
charcoal transport is by means of non-motorized vehicles. These results are not conclusive since&#13;
the survey lasted only a week and did not monitor all access points to the city. The project will&#13;
develop data collection on a regular basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SAR - Household Energy Project                                              19&#13;
only fuelwood; one third sells only charcoal; and only 15 percent sells both fuels at the same&#13;
time. In 1995, most charcoal was transported by pickup trucks (2.5t) of which approximately&#13;
45 are required on a daily basis to satisfy N'Djamena's demand.&#13;
2.21 Wholesalers control about one third of the wood fuels distribution outlets, both wholesale&#13;
and retail. These wholesalers often supply wood to retailers with small concession stands and&#13;
also sell kerosene. Women operate about half of all small retail points and monopolize the&#13;
charcoal market. In total, the informal wood fuels sector employs about 9,000 people on a&#13;
full-time basis of whom 6,000 collect wood and produce charcoal. The rest are involved in&#13;
distribution and retail operations. Including part-time workers, total employment in the sector&#13;
may be in the order of 15,000 employees. In general, the supply and distribution is very&#13;
efficient; there are no major shortages and wood fuels are available at numerous and&#13;
convenient locations throughout the town.&#13;
2.22 Role of Agriculture. Several factors affect depletion rates in the fuelwood catchment&#13;
area surrounding N'Djamena. With the growth of urban population, increased demand for&#13;
both fuelwood and agricultural products drives current land use practices. Agriculture has&#13;
expanded to meet the growing demand for food, and now occupies 200,000 hectares&#13;
surrounding N'Djamena much of which is around the lake Chad area. Farmers have typically&#13;
expanded agricultural activities through sustainable measures. Land clearing for agriculture is&#13;
a pre-requisite that requires the harvesting of wood fuel. As studies have indicated, farmers,&#13;
while clearing land, maintain a broad management perspective to ensure that excessive&#13;
harvesting does not harm the regenerative capacity of woodlands. While they may expand&#13;
agricultural activities, they do it in a manner which does not affect woodlands: by either first,&#13;
reducing fallow periods on land already under cultivation, or secondly, by expanding&#13;
cultivation on low productivity soils which are often free of extensive biomass cover. These&#13;
activities may in the long-term harm agricultural sustainability. However, they do not&#13;
typically harm productive woodlands. Farmers are broadly speaking maintaining an optimal&#13;
rate of depletion of forestry resources.&#13;
LAND-USE PRACTICES&#13;
2.23 Forestry resources are at present considered as common property resource by illegal&#13;
harvesters but are not by the community. Rural communities have highly developed&#13;
traditional laws for regulating the use and extraction of communal resources (Annex 2.2).&#13;
The fact that state laws may not formally recognize these rights and systems is immaterial.&#13;
Villagers have been very adept at defining and managing their rights and use of resources; it is&#13;
only since "illegal" free traders have begun accessing those resources that unsustainable&#13;
management has resulted. Defining and enforcing the economic value of land rights to&#13;
facilitate management by rural communities is essential for sustainable management.&#13;
Allowing exclusive land rights, or usufruct rights, would not sufficiently enforce rights as&#13;
villagers do not have the capability to confront trespassers, many of whom could be armed.&#13;
As proposed in the project, enabling mechanisms for the rural communities will ensure that&#13;
they can exercise control.&#13;
2.24 One way is to establish a management fee system to promote sustainable management of&#13;
common property resources. At present, trees are a valued economic resource on which&#13;
villagers depend for survival. Concurrently they are undervalued by illegal harvesters, 'free-&#13;
riders', who are mining these resources. Mining of these resources is economically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                                 SAR - Household Energy Project&#13;
inefficient, reduces the economic benefits for rural communities, and has long-term&#13;
implications on sustainable use of resources. The introduction of a management fee system&#13;
where villagers levy an extraction fee for the harvesting of wood fuel in their communities&#13;
would discourage over harvesting.&#13;
2.25 Since production costs may be higher, wise economic management of natural resources&#13;
needs to be encouraged. Currently illegal extraction is occurring in large part because&#13;
merchants/cutters are responding to a situation of market failure where resources are&#13;
undervalued due to lax enforcement of community and state laws. Considering the&#13;
circumstances, they are reacting in an economically justified manner (no enforcement of&#13;
property rights and short time horizon).&#13;
2.26 Rate of depletion. While formal property rights do not exist, informal and traditionally&#13;
enforced systems have been in place for some time. Most studies suggest that the optimal rate&#13;
of depletion is being exceeded. Returns on capital and consumer time preferences are&#13;
distorted. Inability on the part of rural communities to exert control over forestry&#13;
management has lead indirectly to the application of inordinately high capital returns for&#13;
fuelwood extraction (no value is applied to forestry resources by harvesters), and of non-&#13;
representative consumer time preferences of individuals seeking quick, short-term rent from&#13;
forestry activities. Actual depletion rates vary considerably throughout the country. In the&#13;
N'Djamena catchment area, the current rate of extraction (depletion) of available wood fuel&#13;
supplies is unsustainable as it is well above the regeneration rate, far exceeding the optimal&#13;
depletion rate. Therefore, the rate of depletion must be assessed in the context of available&#13;
supply (from an economic perspective) to N'Djamena and not total supply.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF WOOD FUELS&#13;
2.27 In certain areas, a fragile balance exists between supply and demand of wood products.&#13;
The closer to N'Djamena, the more upset the balance. One of the main reasons is the rapidly&#13;
increasing urban demand for wood fuels. Permits are provided by a central department&#13;
without reference to the carrying capacity of the wood resource base (i.e. mining). Without&#13;
consulting villagers, wood cutters take wood which is easily accessible. As long as&#13;
responsibilities for managing the resources (including the rights for exploitation) are not given&#13;
to the villages, it seems unlikely that the negative effects on the resource can be reversed.&#13;
2.28 The urban preference for charcoal exacerbates existing environmental problems. The&#13;
charcoaling process is inefficient, implying that charcoal using households could consume at&#13;
least 3 times more wood than firewood consuming households. Even improved charcoal&#13;
stoves will not compensate for this. Nevertheless, it is important that there be&#13;
commercialization of improved charcoal stoves: the share of charcoal in the energy mix of&#13;
urban Chad will increase over time and every kg of charcoal that is not consumed will save 7&#13;
to 8 kg of wood.&#13;
2.29 Correlated to deforestation are water and wind erosion, declining soil fertility, micro&#13;
climate deterioration, and loss of species diversity. This has an impact on several aspects of&#13;
village life: wood supply, agriculture, animal husbandry, etc. However, experience in Niger&#13;
shows that the effects are reversible. Once the forest cover begins to reappear, grasses, other&#13;
plants, and animals tend to reappear as well. It is difficult to quantify these processes as there&#13;
is not much data on either declining or improving soil erosion, soil fertility, and wildlife.&#13;

WOOD FUELS PRICING AND TAXATION&#13;
2.30 Actual Retail Prices. Comparative fuel prices for the different forms of energy (Annex&#13;
2.3) show that the more convenient modern fuels are much more expensive than traditional&#13;
fuels. In fact, a household moving up the energy ladder will face a double energy unit price&#13;
each time (s)he makes such a switch. The effect is less when stove efficiencies are factored&#13;
in: the cost differences between charcoal and firewood are not so large any more but there&#13;
remains a major gap between modern fuels such as kerosene, LPG and the traditional fuels (in&#13;
combination with traditional stoves) which is shown in the last column of Annex 2.3. Modern&#13;
fuels are therefore not an option for the majority of households in N'Djamena, and the market&#13;
for such fuels will remain limited. A 1992 survey by ADER/FED/DFPE 6 indicated the retail&#13;
price of wood in N'Djamena to be in the order of 13-22 CFA per kg, depending on the&#13;
quantity purchased (Annex 2.3).&#13;
2.31 Structure of Charcoal Prices. Annex 2.3 shows the structure of the charcoal price (1996)&#13;
in N'Djamena based on motorized transport from a distance of 100 km outside the city. For a&#13;
retail price of CFAF 80 per kg, about 46 percent is the gross margin for the merchant-&#13;
distributor and the retailer. In addition, the cost of the wood to the merchants and the taxes&#13;
are extremely low, and taxes paid to GOC only amount to 3 percent of the retail price.&#13;
2.32 Taxation System. As Annex 2.3 indicates, the cost of wood and taxes are almost a&#13;
negligible portion of the current retail price and do not take into account the wood's economic&#13;
value. The basis for the current taxation of wood fuels is a Government decree of 1985 which&#13;
established five tax categories, according to the product and its packaging: CFAF 100 per sack&#13;
of charcoal; CFAF 20 per bundle of wood, 300 CFAF per stere of wood, CFAF 1,500 per ton&#13;
of wood within a 30 km radius of the capital and CFAF 1,000 per ton beyond this radius.&#13;
Inspection Forestiere 5 (IFS) is in charge of the control of wood fuel transport in the&#13;
N'Djamena supply region. It has check points in most villages from where wood is supplied&#13;
and at the entrance of the city.&#13;
2.33 There are several serious distortions in the tax system. First, there is no uniform&#13;
measuring system for the tax, which is based either on the main unit of volume, the stere, or&#13;
on the weight in lkg. Survey data indicates that the tax per kg which results from the&#13;
volumetric measurement converted to weight equivalent is CFAF 0.75, less than half the tax&#13;
based on weight, which is CFAF 1.5. In any case, the actual tax paid turns out to be lower&#13;
than both of these rates -- CFAF 0.3 per kg. Second, there is no standard definition of the&#13;
bundle which rural suppliers produce and the weight of the bundle varies considerably. Third,&#13;
the tax rate for charcoal is CFAF 2.55 per kg despite the production of a kg of charcoal which&#13;
requires almost eight kg of wood, making the tax rate of wood used in charcoal-making only&#13;
CFAF 0.3 per kg, much lower than what applies to wood used directly as fuel. In addition, the&#13;
control system is not very effective and tax collection rates are low.&#13;
2.34 In addition to the above, illicit taxes are levied and could amount for charcoal to as much&#13;
as CFAF 50 per bag, mainly to allow expedient passage. The proposed wood fuel user fee (or&#13;
"tax" as per Law 36) will replace all earlier mentioned taxes and would be paid at the rural&#13;
market at the time of purchase or at the city entrance. The estimated rate of revenue recovery&#13;
is only 10- 15 percent. Forestry staff are insufficient for the monitoring required. A better rate&#13;

of revenue collection could generate the funds necessary to finance management services or&#13;
technical support in the wood production zones. To address weaknesses in the fiscal regime,&#13;
the ESMAP study recommended that the Government establishes a new fiscal and regulatory&#13;
system based on: a fee level that reflects the cost of wood replacement; the proceeds from fee&#13;
collection to managers and owners of forest resources (i.e. villages); and incentives for&#13;
reinvesting revenues from fees in forest management activities and reforestation.&#13;
2.35 Economic Pricing of Wood. The economic price range of wood can be estimated using&#13;
different methods: border pricing of the closest substitution fuel, i.e. kerosene; marginal&#13;
environmental cost pricing; or replacement value pricing. The most conservative, border&#13;
pricing, would result in approximately $147 per ton of wood (CFAF 69 per kg) based on the&#13;
current retail price minus 45% margin. In-country transport costs are to be added. The most&#13;
broad-reaching approach, incorporating marginal environmental costs, is difficult to apply as&#13;
it depends on many elements that are unknown. The marginal environmental value of wood&#13;
should reflect its long-run marginal value, based on both its immediate environmental effects&#13;
and the needs of future generations. Thus, the opportunity cost of wood equals the direct&#13;
harvesting costs (the marginal costs as usually perceived) and the marginal external costs of&#13;
wood to different sectors, such as agriculture, livestock, etc.&#13;
2.36 Replacement value pricing can be estimated based on reforestation or on a management&#13;
system of existing resources. Industrial wood plantations do not exist in Chad and the few&#13;
small holder plantations that exist are marginally successful. Two small holder plantations are&#13;
known. One has been abandoned and the other is maintained but shows poor growth rates.&#13;
Experience in other countries suggests invariably that management systems deliver wood at&#13;
much lower costs than reforestation. Such valuation is not available for N'Djamena but&#13;
estimations for the Niamey region in Niger, which has similar conditions as those in&#13;
N'Djamena, can provide an approximate indicative value. Investment costs for management&#13;
systems range between $10 - $50 per hectare and $500 - $1000 per hectare for plantations.&#13;
An evaluation of costs in Niger shows a cost of about CFAF 5-9 per kg to establish and&#13;
implement a forest management program. Taking this additional resource cost into account,&#13;
the retail price of wood in N'Djamena would be CFAF 30 per kg or slightly above the current&#13;
retail price.&#13;
DEMAND AND SUPPLY OUTLOOK FOR WOOD FUELS&#13;
2.37 Overall, the population in Chad is growing at the average annual rate of 2.5 percent&#13;
annually and is expected to increase to 9.35 million in 2010. The urban population, about 21&#13;
percent of the population in 1993, is expected to grow at a higher rate of about 3.5 percent&#13;
annual. At this rate the urban population will double by the year 2010; if the current trends in&#13;
household energy consumption do not change, the demand for wood as an energy source will&#13;
more than double. Wood transformed in 1990 into charcoal only made up 59 percent of the&#13;
total wood exploitation in the N'Djamena area, whereas this has increased to as much as 77&#13;
percent in 1995.&#13;
2.38 Given the projected demand trends, wood production on a country-wide basis will still be&#13;
higher than demand. But for large urban areas these trends indicate possible wood shortages,&#13;
especially in N'Djamena. By 2010, the population in N'Djamena is expected to be about 1.5&#13;
million, triple the current level. Studies in other African countries have indicated rapid&#13;
growth in charcoal consumption associated with urbanization. Taking this into account, wood&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

offtake in the N'Djamena area will increase from 410,000 tons in 1995 to 730,000 tons in&#13;
2010. Even in 1995, the corresponding annual wood production will be only slightly higher&#13;
than the demand, about 535,000 tons. Furthermore, since other activities such as agriculture&#13;
will also require the use of forested areas, land use tensions could threaten the sustainability of&#13;
wood supply to meet demand.&#13;
SECTOR POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
Supply-Side&#13;
2.39 GOC has no concerted household energy strategy to address expected shortages in wood&#13;
supply. But a general framework for such a strategy exists in the national plan against&#13;
desertification (PNLCD) which Chad adopted in 1989. There are three parts to the PNLCD.&#13;
The first is the protection of ecological resources through efforts to realize forest potential,&#13;
such as improvemnent in crop management, soil protection, rationalization of wood cutting,&#13;
different types of afforestation, and sensitization of the population for wood use efficiency.&#13;
The second part is the design of a land-management plan to be implemented on the village&#13;
level. The third part concerns institutional strengthening, emphasizing the need to set up&#13;
structures adapted to integrated rural development programs and improving production and&#13;
pricing systems favorable to resource conservation.&#13;
2.40 In Chad, land tenure is complicated and there is ambiguity in current forest legislation&#13;
and in the fiscal Regime. (Annex 2.2). In 1989, GOC began a project to establish a new&#13;
forestry code which would provide GOC authorities with greater powers to control the use of&#13;
forest resources and give specific propriety rights to private parties that regenerate forested&#13;
areas. The proposed new forestry code is based on three principles. The first is the transfer of&#13;
responsibility for forest management from the state to the local population. This transfer,&#13;
based on the orgEnization of rural village markets, would take place within the context of an&#13;
overall wood management and supply plan for each major city. The second principle is the&#13;
reorientation of the State's role to monitor wood flows, raise money to implement the&#13;
aforementioned transfer, and supervise the execution of the overall management plans. The&#13;
third principle is to professionalize all activities which include woodcutting, charcoaling,&#13;
transport, etc. through technical assistance to improve the technology and organization of&#13;
these activities.&#13;
2.41 Projects to Enhance Wood Supply. There have hardly been any projects to improve&#13;
forest exploitation except for a reforestation program for 7,500 hectares (ha) of forest with&#13;
limited results. In addition, Chad only has limited (albeit positive) experience with improving&#13;
the efficiency of charcoal production. At the time of the ESMAP survey, there were some&#13;
ongoing pilot forest-management projects within the context of the ADER project which FED&#13;
was financing and the FAO project which the Netherlands was funding. These projects&#13;
showed some promising results but civil war prevented their completion.&#13;
2.42 As presented in the Project Evaluation Chapter (Chapter 4), expansion of the road&#13;
network would facilitate an increase in available wood fuel supplies as supply is presently a&#13;
function of road length. Though it is questionable at what cost this policy could be pursued,&#13;
investment in a road network or for improved port/river facilities to exploit fuelwood supplies&#13;
may not be an efficient allocation of economic resources. With typical construction costs as&#13;
high as US $1 million per kilometer of roadway, road investment is unlikely to generate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                 SAR - Household Energy Project&#13;
sufficient economic benefits to justify such a project, particularly in a country with a low&#13;
population density and undeveloped regional trade and markets.&#13;
Demand-Side&#13;
2.43 Improved Stoves. The penetration of improved stoves in the household sector is at a&#13;
very early stage in Chad compared to other Sahelian countries: only about 4 percent of&#13;
households are using an improved stove. This low level of penetration is mainly due to&#13;
insufficient promotional activities by the related stove enterprises as well as poorly designed&#13;
improved stove models. There are about thirty informal, artisan enterprises in N'Djamena&#13;
that produce wood and charcoal stoves, both traditional and improved models. About two&#13;
thirds are individual enterprise and one third operate as private cooperatives. Most artisans&#13;
produce improved stoves by special order in the context of specific projects for their&#13;
distribution. But they produce traditional stoves continuously and most sell them to clients at&#13;
the workshop while some artisans use traveling sales persons.&#13;
2.44 Interfuel Substitution. The use of several fuels by most households in N'Djamena&#13;
indicates that household energy consumption has begun a transition. This transition in many&#13;
African countries is characterized by the progressive use of charcoal as the principal&#13;
household fuel along with the penetration of more modern fuels such as kerosene and&#13;
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The ESMAP survey asked householders about the advantages&#13;
and disadvantages to the use of the various household fuels, aside from the price&#13;
considerations. Annex 2.3 summarizes the responses, which indicate that charcoal is by far&#13;
the preferred fuel at the present time and attempts to encourage the substitution of kerosene or&#13;
LPG will require education campaigns to address some of the perceived disadvantages.&#13;
Annex 2.3 also shows that the majority of the wood fuels users are quite satisfied with their&#13;
present fuel and that half of them has no intention to switch to other fuels.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS&#13;
2.45 The capacity of MMEP, especially that of the Directorate of Petroleum and New and&#13;
Renewable Energy (DPENR) is not well adapted to the institutional needs for developing and&#13;
implementing a household energy strategy. The DPENR has 42 professional positions, mostly&#13;
electrical engineers. Others have a petroleum background, either in physics or chemistry.&#13;
Neither their training nor their experience is adequate to implement the different components&#13;
of the household energy strategy. To ensure the availability of professionals capable of&#13;
monitoring and evaluating the execution of the household energy strategy, considerable in-&#13;
country training and some specialized training outside Chad will be necessary. The same&#13;
holds for staff of the Directorate of Forests and Environmental Protection (DFPE) who will&#13;
have completely different objectives when village management plans become operational.&#13;
2.46 Chad's forestry staff is insufficient in number and in expertise to effectively manage its&#13;
forest resource base. There are only 283 professional staff allocated among various staff&#13;
categories, as indicated in Annex 2.2. The staff chiefly responsible for field execution of&#13;
forestry programs, the technical advisors and their agents, account for only 16 percent of total&#13;
staff which implies an average of 29,000 km2 of territory to monitor per forestry agent. The&#13;
forestry aides, contractual surveyors, and various forestry officers often have low levels of&#13;
technical skills. To develop a competent and motivated staff, GOC needs to establish several&#13;
types of training programs, local and foreign, for all levels of forestry services. In addition,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

SAR - Household Energy Project                                           25&#13;
the focus of involvement should change away from control and policing to extension and&#13;
providing advise. Responsibility for maintaining wood resources should be given to rural&#13;
villages which is in their interest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.  THE PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1 The key objective of the project is to provide an economic and sustainable supply of&#13;
energy for households. Least cost supply and sustainability are being achieved through a&#13;
community based participatory approach and environmental awareness. The specific&#13;
objectives of the project are to: (i) promote the establishment of the sustainable production of&#13;
woodfuel in selected villages providing energy to the capital, N'Djamena; (ii) strengthen the&#13;
capacity of the Borrower to extend such production elsewhere; (iii) carry out institutional&#13;
reforms in the household energy sector; and (iv) improve efficiency in the use of household&#13;
energy.&#13;
PROJECT DESIGN&#13;
3.2 Four key concepts were used to design the project. Thefirst is the need for simultaneous&#13;
intervention on the demand and the supply side to avert wood shortages and environmental&#13;
degradation over the long term. The second is the involvement of the private sector and local&#13;
communities, a concept which has worked well in other countries, notably Niger. The project&#13;
will actively pursue a transfer of responsibilities to private actors and local communities and&#13;
give them an opportunity to increase revenues from their local environmental resources in a&#13;
sustainable manner. The third is limiting the project to the N'Djamena area because: (a) the&#13;
capital accounts for the bulk of the commercial consumption of wood fuels in the country; (b)&#13;
there is a need to test the concepts on a pilot basis and create the necessary institutional&#13;
capacity before extending the project to other parts of the country; and (c) GOC currently&#13;
lacks the institutional capability to manage a larger project in the sector. Thefourth key&#13;
concept is a participatory approach in implementing the proposed project, making extensive&#13;
use of non-governmental organizations and local consultants to broaden project ownership.&#13;
The project fully supports the CAS objectives and complies with all applicable Bank policies,&#13;
guidelines and best practices, in particular with respect to forestry policy, environmental&#13;
policy and rural energy and development.&#13;
3.3    Participatory Approach: Beneficiary consultations took place at several stages of&#13;
project preparation. The last one involved visits to 50 villages and discussions held with&#13;
villagers and village leaders. Discussions were also held with charcoalers, transporters, and&#13;
other people involved in charcoal and firewood commerce. Local NGOs and/or firms assisted&#13;
in the preparation of parts of the project. Since many of the activities will be implemented by&#13;
the rural population, the participatory approach is a standard approach in addressing the&#13;
problems and finding solutions. The Government prepared the Development Action Plan&#13;
(DAP), which was the starting point for project preparation.&#13;

PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.4 The projecit has the following four components, which were designed following&#13;
extensive consultation with stakeholders (communities, NGO's, transporters, etc.) (para. 3.17,&#13;
para. 3.25):&#13;
(a)    create capacity to develop a village-based natural resource management&#13;
system;&#13;
(b)    create capacity to monitor and control wood products flows;&#13;
(c)   improve the efficiency of household fuel use; and&#13;
(d)    project management.&#13;
Component I: Village-Based Natural Resource Management System&#13;
3.5 This component will comprise approximately 48 percent of the project's base costs will&#13;
be executed by a private agency, Agence pour I 'Energie Domestique &amp; I 'Environnement&#13;
(AEDE). It will establish the capacity to design simple long-term village land-use and wood&#13;
exploitation plans for villages in the N'Djamena wood fuel catchment area. A master plan&#13;
will be developed using the individual village plans as building stones. These plans will be&#13;
developed by NGOs, forestry agents, and villagers, and will be assisted through technical&#13;
assistance provided under the project. These plans will be based on an assessment of local&#13;
wood resources using satellite GIS data and ground-truthing and on evaluation of economic&#13;
activities surrounding the villages. The starting point for such plans will be the traditional&#13;
management systems that have been in place before the central DFPE started issuing&#13;
exploitation permits. At the most basic level, the outcome will be to determine the maximum&#13;
allowable wood cut (or quota) for the resource base of the particular village so that the&#13;
maximum wood offtake does not exceed natural regeneration. At the most sophisticated level,&#13;
detailed plans will be available indicating where, how many, and what species of trees to cut&#13;
over time. Once completed, the plan will be submitted for approval by the DFPE, which will&#13;
propose a long-term contract between the DFPE (on behalf of the Government) and&#13;
representatives of the village. On a contract basis, the responsibility for maintaining and&#13;
managing the natural resources will be transferred to the village. With the responsibility&#13;
comes the right to refuse cutting by people from outside the village and to charge a&#13;
management fee on all wood products that are sold from the village's resources.7&#13;
Consultants, foresters, and villagers will design these land-use and wood exploitation plans on&#13;
a village by village basis. Approximately 100 villages will be targeted on a demand driven&#13;
basis.&#13;
Lessons learnt from the Niger experience show that villagers are quickly convinced about the merits&#13;
of such management systems, if not just because they are given usufruct rights to the products of the&#13;
land. Improvements in terms of biodiversity were observed even within the limited period of the&#13;
project. Particularly, grasses (used for fodder) came back and so did small animals.&#13;
&#13;

3.6 Wood fuel Master Plan. The combined individual management systems will form the&#13;
basis for a comprehensive wood fuel master plan for the N'Djamena region. In this regard,&#13;
DFPE and the project team will: (a) formulate and adopt the necessary regulatory text for the&#13;
commercialization and transport of wood products as well as appropriate fiscal policies&#13;
including the level of wood fuel management fees and their periodic revision; and (b) define&#13;
procedures for the creation of rural wood markets. Annex 3.1 describes the main stages in the&#13;
creation of a rural wood fuel market. These rural markets will be set up in villages that have a&#13;
signed contract with the DFPE. Wood fuel transactions to outsiders will only be allowed at&#13;
these markets. A management fee, that is meant to be an efficient mechanism to manage&#13;
environmental damage, will be charged to transporters of wood and charcoal in addition to the&#13;
cost of wood exploitation and transformation into wood fuel (firewood or charcoal). Its level&#13;
will be zero when the wood is purchased at a rural market but CFAF 300 elsewhere. The user&#13;
fee will be levied at source (in the village) and at the city entrance where five fixed control&#13;
posts will be established and manned by IF5 (para. 3.20). In addition, mobile teams will try to&#13;
catch transporters averting fixed control posts. This reflects the long-range marginal costs of&#13;
maintaining the control system. The monitoring system is designed to become self-financing&#13;
before the end of project implementation. The project team will also: (a) improve the system&#13;
for monitoring the flows of wood used for energy purposes entering into N'Djamena; and (b)&#13;
establish an effective monitoring system for rural markets to develop common standards and&#13;
encourage adherence to official guidelines.&#13;
3.7 Natural resource user fee. Enforcement of existing property rights will facilitate sound&#13;
management of woodlands. The development of a management system is necessary to&#13;
enforce the rights of rural communities. To develop a successful management system, users&#13;
of forestry resources must recognize the economic cost of those resources and make sure that&#13;
viable and easily enforceable measures are in place. Due to limited personnel and financial&#13;
resources, rural communities and authorities will not be able to easily monitor cutting&#13;
activities. Establishing a control zone in urban areas to monitor incoming fuelwood and&#13;
charcoal resources will alleviate the need to monitor and enforce harvesting in the entire&#13;
N'Djamena catchment area. This will reduce the cost of the management system.&#13;
3.8 The introduction of a natural resource user fee, levied at the community level, will&#13;
facilitate successful adoption of this system. Furthermore, villagers will be able to better&#13;
value wood fuel resources, specifically those cut illegally. While they have some control over&#13;
the price for wood and charcoal, the true economic cost of replacement will not be reflected.&#13;
User fees collected by communities would represent a portion of the economic value of&#13;
harvested trees. Rural communities will decide the form in which the benefit of their&#13;
woodlands will accrue to them. This will either be through personal/communal consumption&#13;
or in the form of the natural resource user fees, e.g. monetary compensation. In addition, part&#13;
of the proceeds will go to higher local government structures such as the Sultan of Canton,&#13;
thereby encouraging their participation and support.&#13;
3.9 Types of Supply Zones. Under the master plan, three types of wood fuel production&#13;
zones will be distinguished: "red" where commercial wood fuel production is not allowed&#13;
(i.e., designated Parks, fragile areas, and where the resource base is too small to allow&#13;
commercial exploitation); "yellow" where wood fuel production could take place but is not&#13;
managed; and "green" where villagers are fully responsible for managing forest resources. At&#13;
the beginning of the project, there will be only yellow and red zones and towards the end of&#13;
the project, most yellow zones will have been transformed into green. Annex 3.1 provides&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SAR - Household Energy Project                                                29&#13;
information about the process of creating such management systems. Several conditions&#13;
should exist before responsibility is transferred to a village: (a) land boundaries should be&#13;
established and agreed with neighboring villages and forested areas should have been&#13;
surveyed; (b) a simple land-use and wood exploitation plan for the local resource base should&#13;
be prepared by an NGO or private firm in collaboration with villagers; (c) the plan should be&#13;
approved by the DFPE, and (d) the village should have formed its own management structure,&#13;
signed a long-term contract for the implementation of the plan, and established a rural market.&#13;
8&#13;
3.10 Taxation System. As part of the rationalization of the wood energy sector, the&#13;
Government has decided to change the existing tax structure on wood fuels. Tax will now be&#13;
levied at source and paid by transporters, replacing all existing cutting permits and wood fuel&#13;
taxes. This is described in a forestry law, No. 36/PR194, dated December 3, 1994, and&#13;
implemented through a decree (#107/MTE/DG/97) dated 3/14/97. This tax structure is critical&#13;
to project success. If it is properly implemented, it will be an effective management tool to&#13;
provide incentives to most stakeholders to use scarce resources more efficiently. The user fee&#13;
is primarily to facilitate natural resource management, reflecting cost of control and&#13;
management of the resources. Assurances have been obtained before negotiations that the&#13;
level, recovery, and allocation of the tax (user fees) will be acceptable to IDA at all times&#13;
during project implementation. Additional revenues are secondary; although they could turn&#13;
out to be substantial.&#13;
3.11 Initially, the level of the user fee in green zones will not change from earlier; it will&#13;
remain at the previous level of CFAF 300 per stere of wood. For charcoal, the level will&#13;
increase from C]FAF 100 to CFAF 300 per bag to reflect the actual wood content of the&#13;
charcoal (one needs approximately one stere per 40 kg bag). This level is justified as the&#13;
economic analysis shows that a user fee of about CFAF 330 per stere should be levied in&#13;
respect to the resources that are being depleted (para. 4.17). Under the new tax system,&#13;
differential levels are introduced as there are different management and control costs involved&#13;
in the green or yellow zones. Environmental damage is prone to occur more in yellow than in&#13;
green zones, thus justifying lower fees in green zones and higher fees in yellow zones. Fee&#13;
levels for wood fuels from yellow zones will initially be as follows: CFAF 600 per 40 kg-bag&#13;
of charcoal and CFAF 600 per stere of wood. After a six month period, DFPE and DIT will&#13;
evaluate these levels and determine whether changes are required. For the different types of&#13;
trucks that transport wood fuels, the loading capacity will be estimated and corresponding tax&#13;
levels will be determined. In green zones, fees will be collected at source; supply from yellow&#13;
zones will be charged at city entrance (para. 3.20).&#13;
3.12 Since there will be more green zones over time, the effective user fee will gradually&#13;
reduce. A village that creates a rural market and develops plans to manage its wood resources&#13;
properly will start charging the lower fee. By allowing "green zone" villages to keep part of&#13;
the fees and by tlhe employment created in rural areas, powerful incentives are provided to&#13;
manage effectively local resources in a sustainable manner. The fees will be paid by&#13;
transporters, who will transfer the charge to the end users. The latter are thus given better&#13;
market signals about the scarcity of the resource which facilitates fuel substitution and&#13;
8 A rural market is a central place in the village where wood products are sold; transactions in other&#13;
locations will no longer be allowed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                 SAR - Household Energy Project&#13;
conservation of wood fuel consumption. Since wood fuel costs in relation with the household&#13;
budget is small, it is expected that a 10 percent increase will not cause problems.9 The fees&#13;
will also create more revenue for the government though this is not the primary objective.&#13;
However, it should allow the government to fund an extension of the program resulting in&#13;
additional green zone villages, to establish rural nurseries, etc., and reimburse the costs of the&#13;
project.&#13;
3.13 The level of the user fees will be evaluated at least once a year by DFPE and DIT, and&#13;
adjusted if warranted, in particular, for economic reasons. DFPE or DIT will collect payments&#13;
from villagers which will be transferred to the Treasury on a regular basis (paras. 3.14 - 3.16).&#13;
Wood fuel trade will take place at rural markets which are established to make monitoring&#13;
easier and more transparent. Upon payment of the user fee, a receipt is issued by a designated&#13;
village representative. The receipt has three parts: one for the transporter, one for DFPE/DIT&#13;
(for record keeping) and one which will be handed over to personnel of the IF control point&#13;
(Inspection Forestiere) at the entrance of N'Djamena. Without a receipt, IF personnel will&#13;
charge fees as if the wood came from a yellow zone. The system of receipts will allow double&#13;
checking and tracking of the origin of the wood fuel flows as the receipts make mention of the&#13;
village of origin. The Treasury portion of the tax revenue will be deposited in a designated&#13;
bank account.&#13;
3.14 In green zones, transporters can only buy wood from local managers of the rural market.&#13;
They negotiate a price for the wood and pay the relatively low wood fuel user fee. They are&#13;
no longer allowed to make charcoal or cut wood themselves in green zones unless they are&#13;
contracted by the village. Wood fuel prices will entirely be determined between villagers and&#13;
transporters. No-one will be exempted from paying these user fees. At the city gates there&#13;
will be checkpoints to verify that payments have been made and to register where the wood&#13;
fuel originated. Since the villagers are allowed to keep most of the fees, they are likely to be&#13;
very effective in its collection. The proceeds of the fees will be distributed as follows: 10&#13;
percent for Treasury, 50 percent for the village (part for replanting, maintenance and forestry&#13;
management operations), and 40 percent for the local management structures (at the Canton&#13;
and Arrondissement level, administered by the Sultan). An information campaign will inform&#13;
villagers on the importance of local resource management and will suggest reinvesting the&#13;
village budget portion back into the village (such as for building a school, a tree nursery,&#13;
water pump, etc.).&#13;
3.15 For wood harvested from yellow zones, transporters will no longer need to buy a cutting&#13;
permit since this has not worked well before, but instead will need to pay the wood fuel tax&#13;
when entering the city (at the IF control point). The level of the payment is higher than in&#13;
green zones giving an incentive to transporters to go to green villages. The tax revenue will&#13;
be deposited in a designated bank account. Transporters will receive a receipt and the IF&#13;
control point will keep a copy.&#13;
3.16 In red zones no commercial wood exploitation is allowed. Red zones are classified as&#13;
forests, reserves, and parks. Zones that are severely degraded can be classified red as well.&#13;
9 This increase can easily be offset by improved stoves, which should reduce consumption by about&#13;
20% (para. 2. 10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
SAR - Household Energy Project                                                31&#13;
The Government: needs to concentrate its efforts to protect red zones through the forestry&#13;
police.&#13;
3.17 It will take some time and effort before transporters know the system and comply. In&#13;
order to reach that point as quickly as possible, meetings will be organized to discuss the&#13;
problems and find solutions. Rural wood and charcoal markets will be established in villages&#13;
in green zones oni a demand driven basis. Every village with an approved management plan&#13;
should have a rural market. Areas closest to N'Djamena along the main roads should be&#13;
converted into green zones first. As this cannot be done overnight, a transition period will&#13;
exist for a limited time. An effort should be made to create as many green zones as quickly as&#13;
possible starting with the main production areas where wood cutting is currently concentrated.&#13;
Although it will require a substantial effort in sensitization and communications with&#13;
villagers, the rural consultations in about 50 villages showed that villagers are quite keen on&#13;
taking on those responsibilities if the Government helps them enforcing the new rules. The&#13;
control and monitoring systems are precisely developed to achieve that.&#13;
3.18 Techniques for planting, maintaining small nurseries, etc. will be demonstrated as well as&#13;
better wood cutting techniques that promote spontaneous regeneration. Efficient charcoal&#13;
conversion techniques will be promoted in green zones where charcoal is produced on a&#13;
regular basis. This will be done by training on the spot, i.e. by a charcoaler trainer who will&#13;
assist occasional charcoalers to become more professional. Improved techniques will be&#13;
demonstrated for which the only investment required is training and a chimney made of used&#13;
oil drums. It is certain that some time will be needed to make this understood by all actors in&#13;
the field. A substantial effort to increase awareness is clearly needed. As an example, the&#13;
military is currently accustomed to obtaining a free permit and harvesting the wood in villages&#13;
which have no say in the matter. Once the new system is in place, there are three options: (a)&#13;
business as usual, which will have to take place in yellow zones only (but the user fee will&#13;
need to be paid when entering N'Djamena), (b) buying the wood at a rural market in green&#13;
zones (and paying a lower user fee), or (c) starting to use alternative fuels such as kerosene.&#13;
Component II: Monitoring and Control of Wood Products Flows&#13;
3.19 Accounting for about 20 percent of project base costs, the inflow of wood products from&#13;
rural production zones into N'Djamena will be monitored by AEDE. User fees/taxes will be&#13;
collected by IF, and payment compliance will be verified by AEDE, which will also compile&#13;
statistical data. The user fee will be used as an environmental policy instrument, working on&#13;
three different levels: (a) providing an incentive to villages to manage their resources as well&#13;
as possible; (b) guiding transporters towards areas of least-cost wood locations (green:&#13;
minimal fee but have to buy the wood; yellow, intermediary fee but wood is free; and red&#13;
prohibited); and (c) giving incentives for end-users to use improved stoves and wood products&#13;
more rationally as prices increase. A mechanism will be designed to adjust the fees/taxes to&#13;
reflect varying economic costs over time and possibly by location.&#13;
3.20 Effective control at the city gate will be important. A detailed study has been carried out&#13;
to confirm its feasibility. Fixed control points will be established at the five main entry axes&#13;
into N'Djamena and will be permanently manned; some of these are already operational.&#13;
These five posts will replace the existing posts throughout the N'Djamena catchment area. In&#13;
addition, three mobile teams (two teams using cars and motorcycles and one team using boats)&#13;
will be created to fill in any gaps. Control beyond the city will be impossible due to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

vastness and accessibility of the land. In the way the project is designed, there is relatively&#13;
tight control at entrance (in the villages where wood resources are managed) and at the point&#13;
of consumption (in town). A system of triple receipts will allow verification of data. Also, it&#13;
will provide data to monitor wood flows which will be used to fine-tune the wood supply&#13;
master plan. The private agency will be fully auto-financed from proceeds of the user fee/tax&#13;
expected at the end of the project; although this may happen as early as by the second year of&#13;
the project.&#13;
3.21 AEDE will collect the user fee/tax proceeds, once a week from rural markets and every&#13;
other day from fixed control points. It will deposit the money into the appropriate accounts&#13;
(villages and Treasury). AEDE is allowed to keep 50 percent of the proceeds assigned to the&#13;
Treasury to finance its operations.&#13;
Component III: Improving the Efficiency of Household Fuel Use&#13;
3.22 On the demand side, accounting for about 19 percent of total project base costs, the two&#13;
subcomponents will also be executed by AEDE: (a) the commercialization of efficient&#13;
cooking stoves (firewood, charcoal); (b) the promotion of the use of low-cost kerosene and&#13;
LPG stoves. Suitable improved stove models will be identified and tested. Stove producers&#13;
will produce prototype stoves and receive feedback from the tests to improve the models. The&#13;
objective of this subcomponent is not to promote the use of charcoal stoves and encourage&#13;
households to switch from firewood to charcoal but to have households use less fuel and&#13;
derive greater benefits. There will be a publicity and awareness campaign to start the&#13;
development of the market for the models developed under the project. NGOs will be&#13;
involved in the implementation of this subcomponent for testing, product development,&#13;
monitoring of stove performance, and for promotional activities. If such capacity does not&#13;
exist, training will be provided under the project. A similar approach will be followed with&#13;
the kerosene and LPG stove subcomponent. However, stoves (or most components) will need&#13;
to be imported rather than manufactured locally.&#13;
3.23 A market study was carried out to determine the prospects for introducing better stoves.&#13;
About half of the population of N'Djamena is presently not satisfied with their cooking fuel.&#13;
Based on surveys, it was estimated that of the 116,000 households, 15% would ultimately&#13;
refuse any change, 28% could adopt an improved stove, 45% could start using kerosene, and&#13;
17% could start using LPG. Households that decide to use substitution fuels will continue to&#13;
use charcoal for some time. Although these numbers indicate what can be reached, the&#13;
following conservative targets will be set as project objective: to commercialize (entirely by&#13;
the private sector) some 17,000 improved woodstoves, 11,000 improved charcoal stoves,&#13;
8,000 kerosene stoves, and 4,000 LPG stoves.&#13;
Component IV. Project Management&#13;
3.24 Approximately 12 percent of project base costs are allocated for project management.&#13;
Successful implementation will require setting up a database to monitor performance and&#13;
developments in household energy markets over time, and also reach considerable effort in&#13;
capacity building. An essential part of the project will be capacity building and sensibilization&#13;
through training, technical assistance and education/information and promotional actions for&#13;
both public and private actors with systematic stakeholder consultation. An allocation for&#13;

SAR - Household Energy Project                                                33&#13;
studies will allow the preparation of the next phase (in the South and East of the country,&#13;
around secondary cities) and help villages with a management plan to further improve their&#13;
performance on a demand driven basis. Civil works will be needed for the structural&#13;
improvement of AEDE's main office and satellite offices around the N'Djamena area.&#13;
SECTOR REFORM AS PART OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
3.25 Based on the DAP, the Government initiated the process to change the law dealing with&#13;
wood fuel issues. Systematic client consultations were organized at several points in time, the&#13;
last one was in early 1996, when approximately 50 villages in the project area were contacted.&#13;
Key policy changes have already been realized in this process. Law 36/PR194 (portant&#13;
organ isation de la commercialisation et du transport de bois dans les grandes agglomerations&#13;
et de laflscalite qui lui est applicable), dated December 3, 1994, specifically states, inter alia:&#13;
(a)    Ownership of forests: concessions of public forests to rural communities or&#13;
rural villages and state owned enterprises are allowed; the transfer of full&#13;
property rights to rural communities or rural villages is allowed for domanial&#13;
forests that have been regenerated or saved from disappearance; and&#13;
individuals or entities who planted trees or forests on their own terrain will&#13;
enjoy full ownership without restrictions.&#13;
(b)    Transport of wood products: only commercial transporters are allowed to&#13;
transport wood products to towns; these transporters must have a license.&#13;
(c)    Rural wood markets: wood markets can be established in rural villages where&#13;
prices of wood products are to be freely determined by the sellers; local, rural&#13;
wood cutter organizations are the sole to exploit wood for supply to the rural&#13;
markets; for exploitation of privately owned forests, an authorization can be&#13;
obtalined from the local DFPE representatives; and wood exploitation should&#13;
not exceed annual regeneration capacity of the resources that supply to the&#13;
rural wood market; quota will be established.&#13;
(d)    "Taxes": which correspond mostly to a user fee levied on the transport of&#13;
wood is called "taxeforestiere" and is paid by the transporter to a designated&#13;
person at the rural market according to the nature of the product and the&#13;
category of production zone; the user fee/tax structure will be periodically&#13;
reassessed, based on inflation, price of substitution fuels, etc.; the law also&#13;
refers to the control system to be established, penalties in case of fraud, and&#13;
remuneration for control agents.&#13;
3.26 This non-exhaustive list of issues that are addressed in the law (there are 50 articles in&#13;
total) clearly demonstrates the Government's intentions to improve the wood fuel situation.&#13;
PROJECT COSTS&#13;
3.27 The total estimaRted cost of the proposed project is US$ 6.3 million including physical and price&#13;
contingencies. Approximately 50 percent correspond to foreign exchange expenditures. A summary&#13;
of project costs by components is provided in Table 3.1. These estimates include price escalation&#13;
from World Bank estimates of local and intemational inflation for the four years of the&#13;
&#13;

FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.28 IDA will finance about 84 percent (US$ 5.27 million) of total project cost and GOC will&#13;
supply the remaining 16 percent (US$ 1.03 million). GOC will cover the: (a) salaries of&#13;
management staff of DPENR and DFPE involved in the proposed project, and (b) costs of&#13;
AEDE to a maximum of 50 percent in the second year of the project, 25 percent in the third&#13;
year and none in the last year'0. This includes the costs of monitoring the entrance of wood&#13;
energy to N'Djamena and administrative monitoring of rural markets. The governments share&#13;
will also cover certain functional charges related to the project such as electricity, water, and&#13;
telecommunication for its offices. Part of the proceeds of the user fee/tax will be used to&#13;
finance some of the expenses incurred by AEDE. GOC will be responsible for covering all&#13;
taxes, levies, and duties paid under the project (Table 3.2).&#13;
3.29 IDA will be financing 100 percent of foreign costs and a large portion of local costs (70&#13;
%). Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world (GDP $180 per capita) and needs&#13;
foreign aid to facilitate development. Since other donors are yet to provide aid especially in&#13;
the household energy sector, Chad is entirely dependent on IDA.&#13;
10   It is expected that user fee proceeds will cover at least the costs of AEDE minus the indicated&#13;
govermnent contribution.&#13;

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
The Implementing Agency (AEDE)&#13;
3.31 The project will be implemented by AEDE (Agence pour I 'Energie Domestique &amp;&#13;
I 'Environnement), an agency created in 1996 specifically for this project. The statutes of&#13;
AEDE will be modified as a condition of Credit effectiveness to realign responsibilities of the&#13;
organs of AEDE in a manner satisfactory to the Association. AEDE is authorized to operate as&#13;
a non profit autonomous entity under the authorization from MAT (Ministere de&#13;
l 'Administration Territoriale) dated April 23, 1996 comprising of representatives of the CDS,&#13;
NGOs, and the private sector (Annex 3.2). The Government has also issued a Decree granting&#13;
AEDE the status of a Public Interest association (Declaration d'Utilite Publique). To help in&#13;
the implementation of the project, a detailed Project Implementation Manual ("Manuel&#13;
d'Execution") has been prepared that sets out the objectives and institutional arrangements.&#13;
The Manuel is in project files and is outlined in Annex 3.8. Agreement was reached during&#13;
negotiations that the Project Implementation Manual be acceptable to IDA at all times during&#13;
project implementation and any modifications to the Implementation Manual ("Manuel&#13;
d'Execution") be subject to IDA's approval. The project will be implemented over a 4 year&#13;
period, with all project components implemented concurrently (Annex 3.4). The CDS&#13;
(Comite de suivi) will monitor project implementation. It will implement the proposed project&#13;
under a project agreement with IDA and a convention signed by the minister responsible for&#13;
MFEPA on behalf of the Republic of Chad. AEDE should be self-financing at the end of the&#13;
4-year project from proceeds of the user fees. AEDE also will function as a focal point for&#13;
household energy and environmental issues in Chad, and facilitate coordination between&#13;
different stakeholders in this sector. MMEPH and MET will be co-beneficiaries of the&#13;
proposed project with non-governmental institutions playing an important role in project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.32 A General Manager was selected in August 1997. Assurances were obtained during&#13;
negotiations that AEDE General Manager, the Administration and Financial Director&#13;
(Directeur Administratif et Financier) and the two persons respectively in charge within&#13;
AEDE of rural markets and of the user-fee system, will be appointed in accordance with&#13;
procedures specified under IDA consultants guidelines and will be acceptable to IDA at all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

36                                               SAR - Household Energy Project&#13;
times during project implementation. The appointment of AEDE's Administration and&#13;
Financial Director and of the persons respectively in charge of rural markets and of&#13;
monitoring the tax system will be a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
3.33 As a condition of effectiveness, the Government will provide a signed copy of the&#13;
convention between AEDE and the Republic of Chad.&#13;
3.34 With respect to the resource management component, AEDE, among other activities,&#13;
will: a) prepare and approve N'Djamena's master plan including resource mapping,&#13;
delimitation of wood-production production areas, supply and demand strategies, socio-&#13;
economic surveys; b) provide information to the rural areas about the new regulatory&#13;
framework with respect to forestry resource management, user fees and particularly the role&#13;
of rural markets; c) select individuals and firms including NGOs that will establish wood fuels&#13;
and charcoal markets in rural areas; (d) facilitate coordination between MMEP and MEE and&#13;
the Ministry in charge of Finance (MFEPA) about fiscal aspects; e) set up a system to follow&#13;
up payments of user fees; and f) develop new charcoaling techniques with local charcoalers.&#13;
For the demand side management component, AEDE will: a) set up a data collection and a&#13;
evaluation system to monitor use of improved and traditional cookstoves; b) assess alternative&#13;
cookstoves and marketing mechanisms; c) design pilot operations for the import, production&#13;
and sales of efficient cookstoves by local private professionals; and d) design&#13;
promotion/information campaigns.&#13;
3.35 AEDE will act as the maitre d'ouvrage delegue and be responsible for: (a) the&#13;
procurement and management of contracts for materials and services; and (b) verification of&#13;
user fee collection on wood for energy use and the management of some of the funds&#13;
collected. It may decide to subcontract part of the work out to NGOs, particularly the&#13;
monitoring and control function of wood flows. The technical assistance necessary to&#13;
establish the Project will be supplied by firms and entities selected in accordance with para&#13;
3.50 below, within the framework of an overall contract with AEDE. The selection of the&#13;
candidates will take place according to Bank's Guidelines. The technical assistance will also&#13;
provide methodological support to DPENR, DFPE and AEDE, and the training necessary for&#13;
management positions at the national level. This will also be applied to local operators who&#13;
will implement subcontracts. Studies will be conducted as needed to assist rural villages in&#13;
achieving further energy efficiency gains and to prepare for an extension of the project to the&#13;
southern and eastern regions of the country. The studies will be coordinated by DPENR and&#13;
DFPE.&#13;
Comite de Suivi (CDS)&#13;
3.36 The ad-hoc CDS (Comite de suivi) that was created as a special task force to prepare the&#13;
Detailed Action Plan (DAP) (para 1.1 1), has been formalized by a decree of the Council of&#13;
Ministers dated October 10, 1996. The CDS will be responsible for general project&#13;
supervision, if needed adjustments in the project implementation strategy and for the&#13;
identification of the necessary regulatory and fiscal measures. It has five permanent&#13;
members: the Director of DPENR (chairman) of MMEP, the Director of DFPE of MEE, the&#13;
Director of DIT of MFI, the Director of External Aid and Planning and the Director of&#13;
Regulations from the Government's General Secretary. DPENR will ensure CDS's secretariat.&#13;
The CDS will meet at least once a year; additional meetings may be required for the&#13;

SAR - Household Energy Project                                             37&#13;
preparation of regulatory framework, the revision of taxation on wood used for energy, and&#13;
the definition of administrative procedures for the creation of rural wood markets.&#13;
3.37 In their respective technical areas, the MMEP and the MEE will supervise and monitor&#13;
the four project components implemented by AEDE. Two persons from MMEP will&#13;
participate in monitoring activities regarding improved cookstoves, substitution stoves,&#13;
improved charcoal making techniques, facilitate the Project's effective functioning, and create&#13;
and maintain a database on household energy. Four persons from MEE will participate in the&#13;
design, development, fine-tuning, and tax-collection. Two personnel from the Ministry of&#13;
Mines, Energy and Petroleum (MMEP) and four personnel from the Ministry of Environment&#13;
and water (MEE) have been assigned to work closely with AEDE in monitoring and&#13;
coordinating the ministry's involvement in project matters. MEE will monitor the components&#13;
related to the development of a village-based natural resource management system and the&#13;
control of wood products flows; MMEP will monitor the component related to improving the&#13;
efficiency of household fuel use. Institutional support will be provided by the project to&#13;
DPENR and DFPE through a system of evaluation and training of its agents. Both ministries&#13;
will be responsible in establishing the regulatory and fiscal framework to support the creation&#13;
of rural wood energy markets.&#13;
AEDE: Operating Procedures&#13;
3.38 The proposed Project will take place over a period of four years and by then should&#13;
become self-financing. A provisional schedule for the execution of principal activities during&#13;
the first four years is attached as Annex 3.4. The performance indicators are provided in&#13;
Annex 3.6.&#13;
3.39 AEDE will issue contracts to consultants and NGOs, will be responsible for procurement&#13;
of equipment (see Annex 3.2) and will work with NGOs which will provide most of the&#13;
technical assistance after being trained under the project. Agreement has been reached prior to&#13;
negotiations that AEDE will use standard IDA Procurement procedures and documentation.&#13;
If technical assistance does not exist locally, it will be of short-term, decreasing over time and&#13;
preferably of regional origin (e.g. Nigerien or Burkinabe consultants). Based on the&#13;
experience of the World Bank Niger Household Energy Project and in Mali, it is important&#13;
that one long-term TA be recruited for two and a half to three years to assist in the launching&#13;
and realization of the village wood management plans and their compilation into an overall&#13;
wood fuel master plan.&#13;
3.40 Proceeds from user fees/taxes collected at the IF control points around the city entrances&#13;
as well as from rural markets will be deposited into designated bank accounts. DIT agents&#13;
will regularly visit collection points to verify compliance with procedures. AEDE can keep 50&#13;
percent of the tax proceeds that it collects on behalf of Treasury to finance its operations.&#13;
Revenues for Treasury are estimated to exceed $400,000 in year two and will gradually&#13;
increase to a level of about $800,000 per year after twenty years. The share to Treasury will&#13;
gradually decrease as the majority of wood producing areas are converted into green zones.&#13;
At that point in time, the need to levy the tax should be evaluated. In principle, there should&#13;
not be a need for a tax if all wood fuels come from managed zones. An initial deposit will&#13;
also be made to the Special Account (para. 3.48) to cover initial operating costs of AEDE.&#13;

Project Monitoring and Review&#13;
3.41 Project Monitoring and Quality Assurance: During project preparation, the&#13;
Government, AEDE and IDA discussed and agreed on quality assurance arrangements and on&#13;
the records and reports necessary to monitor the progress of the project, particularly, the&#13;
achievement of its objectives. In addition to the monitoring and supervision carried out by the&#13;
Comite de Suivi (paras. 3.36 - 3.37), by AEDE's Board (paras. 3.31 - 3.35) and as described in&#13;
AEDE's operating procedures (paras. 3.38-3.39), during the lifetime of the project there will&#13;
be a minimum of two supervision missions per year (para. 3.60) to monitor performance&#13;
indicators (described in Annex 3.6) and the compliance with the Implementation Manual&#13;
(Annex 3.8). The Government, AEDE and IDA agreed that as part of normal project&#13;
supervision there would be a mid-term review at the end of CY 2000, with the participation of&#13;
all stakeholders (para. 3.45). In addition, very close monitoring of project implementation&#13;
will be carried out by the Resident Mission.&#13;
3.42 Monitoring and Evaluation: Agreement has been reached during negotiations that AEDE&#13;
will establish and maintain a project internal accounting and financial system consistent with&#13;
the implementation manual, in accordance with sound accounting principles and practices&#13;
satisfactory to IDA at all times during project implementation. Setting up of AEDE's internal&#13;
accounting and financial system acceptable to IDA will be a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
Interim and annual financial statements will duly reflect the financial performance and&#13;
position of the project. A final audit will be submitted to IDA within six months of the Credit&#13;
Closing Date.&#13;
3.43 Progress status reports will be submitted to by AEDE to CDS and IDA every three&#13;
months, which will include the financial overview, main substantive results, work program,&#13;
and budget status. These reports should be submitted within one month of the end of the&#13;
period concerned. These reports will also contain the following procurement information:&#13;
revised cost estimates of contracts, including best estimates for physical and price&#13;
contingencies; revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract&#13;
award, and completion time for indicated projects; and compliance with aggregated limits on&#13;
procurement methods. Assurances have been obtained that DPENR and DFPE will prepare&#13;
semi-annual progress reports every year and issue a final report (Implementation Completion&#13;
Report) within six months of the Credit Closing Date.&#13;
3.44Annual Reviews: The Project will be implemented over a four-year period. The annual&#13;
reviews will ascertain the efficiency of AEDE's procedures and management using the&#13;
performance indicators described in annex 3.6 and will recommend appropriate changes.&#13;
3.45 Mid-Term Review: Agreement has been reached during negotiations that a mid-&#13;
term review will be carried out two years after project effectiveness. Annex 3.6 provides a&#13;
series of performance indicators that will be used to monitor progress in meeting the project's&#13;
objectives, overall project performance against performance indicators, project costs, and&#13;
compliance with legal covenants. The review will be another opportunity to evaluate, and, if&#13;
needed, to modify some major features of the project. Finally the review will create an&#13;
opportunity to; (a) thoroughly discuss issues with stakeholders and also to (b) evaluate the&#13;
need for including new activities in the project scope in order to better meet the project&#13;
objectives.&#13;

Project Sustainability&#13;
3.46 Project Sustainability: One of the objectives of the project is to obtain a durable solution&#13;
for the wood fuel supply to the capital city of N'Djamena. Income levels need to be risen&#13;
sufficiently so that urban households can afford to switch from wood fuels to modem cooking&#13;
fuels such as kerosene and LPG. The project will ensure that until such level is reached, the&#13;
wood fuel supply and demand balance is positive. Thus improved wood fuel management is&#13;
an essential component in achieving sustainability by meeting the growing energy needs of&#13;
urban populations, maintaining their standard of living and protecting the long-term&#13;
reproductive capacity of woodlands while ensuring that rural communities livelihoods are&#13;
secure as well. In addition, the project supports the setting-up of AEDE, an autonomous&#13;
agency, that will become self-financing at the end of the 4 year project from the proceeds of&#13;
its activities.&#13;

DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.47 The project will be implemented over a four-year period. Annex 3.4 presents the&#13;
project's implementation schedule. Table 3.3 below sets forth the categories of items which&#13;
the IDA credit will finance, the allocation of credit amounts, and the percentage of&#13;
expenditures for items to be financed in each category. The IDA credit will finance 100&#13;
percent of foreign exchange expenditures and up to 90 percent of local expenditures for&#13;
training, goods and civil works. Consulting services, expatriate and local, will be disbursed&#13;
against 100 percent of expenditures, excluding taxes.&#13;

3.48 To expedite disbursements, a Special Account in FCFA francs will be opened in a local&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IDA. AEDE will manage this Special Account. The&#13;
authorized allocation will cover approximately 4 months of expenditures, or the equivalent of&#13;
US$ 500,000. Upon effectiveness, 50% of the authorized allocation will be deposited into the&#13;
Special Account. The remaining balance will be made available as needed. All replenishment&#13;
applications will be fully documented, except in the case of expenditures of less than&#13;
$100,000 for goods and for works, $50,000 for individual consultants, and $100,000 for&#13;
consultant firms, which may be claimed on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
All documents will be kept for review by IDA supervision missions and the external auditors.&#13;

PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.50 Table 3.5 summarizes the project elements, their estimated costs and the proposed&#13;
method of procurernent. No special exemptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in&#13;
credit documents for international competitive bidding as Chad's procurement practices allow&#13;
IDA to take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations. Agreement has&#13;
been reached, that AEDE will procure goods and works in accordance with the procedures&#13;
set-forth in the Guidelines for Procurement under IDRD loans and IDA credits (January 1995,&#13;
revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997) and consulting services in&#13;
accordance with Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers (January 1997, revised in September 1997).&#13;

3.51 Civil Works. Contracts for the rehabilitation and the improvement of the control points&#13;
at the city gate which will cost approximately $123,100 would be procured through NCB&#13;
procedures which are acceptable to IDA. The following procedures would be followed: (a)&#13;
tenders would be advertised locally; (b) bidders would be given a minimum of 30 days for&#13;
submitting bids; (c) evaluation criteria would be specified in precise quantitative/monetary&#13;
terms; (d) all bids would be opened in public, with bidders representatives permitted to attend;&#13;
(e) interested eligible foreign contractors would be allowed to participate in the bidding; and&#13;
(f) contract will be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.&#13;
3.52 Goods financed by IDA (totaling about US$ 1.4 million), consisting of equipment,&#13;
furniture, office supplies, laboratory, vehicles, motorcycles, and boats, would be purchased&#13;
through ICB in accordance with Bank's guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and&#13;
IDA Credits published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996 and&#13;
September 1997. Contracts would as far as possible be packaged for amounts of at least&#13;
$100,000 equivalent. Contracts for office equipment, supplies, furniture, and some vehicles&#13;
and motorcycles available locally for an aggregate amount not to exceed US$300,000, which&#13;
cost more than US$30,000 equivalent but less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract would&#13;
be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Small quantities of office&#13;
equipment, supplies, furniture and consumable materials, which are normally available off the&#13;
shelf at economical prices and cannot be grouped into packages of less than US$30,000&#13;
equivalent per contract, would be procured through international and national shopping, based&#13;
on quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers, provided that the aggregate does&#13;
not exceed US $100,000.&#13;
3.53 Consulting Services, Training, and Special Studies financed by IDA would be for: (i)&#13;
supervision and monitoring, (ii) specialized studies, and (iii) training and development.&#13;
Consultants would be hired in accordance with Bank's Guidelines for the selection and&#13;
employment of Consultants (January 1997 and revised in September 1997). All consultant&#13;
selection will be carried out through competition among qualified short-listed firms in which&#13;
the selection will be based on Quality-and-Cost-Based -Selection (QCBS) by evaluating the&#13;
quality of the proposal before comparing the cost of services to be provided. Financial audits&#13;
will be carried out using the Least Cost Solution method. Individual consultants for some&#13;
specialized technical studies ($200,000) where firms would not be required would be selected&#13;
based on consultant experience and competence for the assignment.&#13;
3.54 Prior review thresholds: IDA financed contracts above the threshold of US$100,000&#13;
equivalent for works and goods receptively would be subject to IDA's prior review. All other&#13;
works and goods contracts under this threshold would be subject to post-review. Prior review&#13;
will apply to contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost&#13;
more than $25,000 each. However for contracts with firms costing more than $50,000, the&#13;
technical evaluation report will also be required for prior review. All other contracts will be&#13;
subject to post review.&#13;
3.55 For the proposed project a number of activities are planned to establish local capacity in&#13;
the area of project coordination and implementation: (a) project coordination will be with&#13;
AEDE and personnel has been recruited for that purpose. Past experience in project&#13;
management and procurement will be taken into consideration in the selection process; (b) a&#13;
detailed processing schedule for goods and services to be procured under the project would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

SAR - Household Energy Project                                             43&#13;
contribute in the timely processing of all required actions. During implementation, all bid&#13;
evaluation reports transmitted to IDA for review would contain an updated copy of the&#13;
implementation schedule.&#13;
3.56 Agreement was confirmed during negotiations on the proper monitoring of procurement,&#13;
the use of Bank standard bidding documents for ICB and standard procurement documents for&#13;
NCB, and model letter of invitation and standard form of contracts for consultants. The&#13;
Government has agreed that it would apply the procurement procedures and arrangements&#13;
outlined above.&#13;
ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND AUDITING&#13;
3.57 AEDE will establish and maintain project accounting according to sound accounting&#13;
principles and practices satisfactory to IDA. Interim and annual financial statements will duly&#13;
reflect the financial performance and status of the project. These statements will include the&#13;
Special Account and SOEs. Appointment of independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Association for a period of four years will be a condition of effectiveness. Agreement has also&#13;
been reached during negotiations that the annual financial audits and the final audit will be&#13;
performed by external independent auditors satisfactory to IDA, both for the Special Account&#13;
and for the Project accounts. The independent final audit will be submitted to IDA within six&#13;
months of the Credit Closing Date.&#13;
3.58 The report provided to the Government and IDA by AEDE at the end of each calendar&#13;
quarter and no later than one month after the end of the quarter regarding progress will&#13;
include a financial overview, main substantive results, work program, and indicative budget.&#13;
This report will also contain the following procurement information: revised cost estimates of&#13;
contracts, including best estimates for physical and price contingencies; revised timing of&#13;
procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for&#13;
indicated projects; and compliance with aggregated limits on procurement methods. DPENR&#13;
and DFPE will issue a final report within six months of the Credit Closing Date.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS (CATEGORY C)&#13;
3.59 The proposed project will considerably reduce soil degradation, bush fires and&#13;
deforestation, through better management of the natural forest cover. The introduction of&#13;
more efficient charcoal-making techniques will reduce the amount of wood required as&#13;
feedstock for this increasingly popular fuel and the increased use of wood originating from&#13;
forest under sustained management. Because of reduced deforestation and the use of more&#13;
efficient stoves, the project will also help reduce carbon dioxide emissions which are harmful&#13;
to the global enviromnent and to the health of the women. The total reduction of C02&#13;
emissions over a 20 year period is expected to exceed I million tons.&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.60 The semi-arnual progress reports prepared by DPENR and DFPE will include an&#13;
overview of achievements, a proposed work plan, and a leaflet with price and flow trends for&#13;
household fuels, including an indication of number of rural markets established, number of&#13;
improved stoves sold, and tax compliance. There will be two supervision missions per year.&#13;
A mid-term review will need to be carried out two years into the project, or mid-2001. Annex&#13;

4. PROJECT EVALUATION&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
4.1 The project supports economic development in line with IDA's country assistance&#13;
strategy, is technically, socially, financially and economically sound and promotes&#13;
environmentally sustainable rural development. The overall project economic rate of return&#13;
(ERR) is 34.4 percent. The Resource Management Component (RMP) of the project has an&#13;
ERR of 25.1 percent and is the least-expensive alternative for the provision of household&#13;
fuels. The next best alternative costs almost 3 times more to supply the same output. The&#13;
Demand Side Management component (DSMP) of the project has an ERR of 75.1 percent.&#13;
These attractive economic indicators are typical for natural resource management and&#13;
household energy conservation projects, where relatively little expenditure ensures better&#13;
management and efficient use of existing resources. The economics of the two&#13;
subcomponents are very robust to changes in key parameters. In addition, there are global&#13;
environmental benefits amounting to $2.9 million which have not been taken into account in&#13;
the economic rate of return. The project financial rate of return is 6.9 percent and the pay&#13;
back time is estimated to be around 12 years.&#13;
4.2 The distributional impact of the project is positive. The distributional coefficient of the&#13;
project (net benefits over a 20-year period to rural and urban poor households as a proportion&#13;
of project net benefits) amounts to 70.4 percent. In addition, 28 percent of net project benefits&#13;
will remain in rural areas, through proceeds of user fees and increased agricultural&#13;
productivity.&#13;
4.3 Public investment in the RMP component is estimated at $3.9 million (net present value&#13;
at 12% discount rate) and at $1.1 million in the DSMP component. In addition to public&#13;
investment, private investments by villagers for the creation of the rural markets are estimated&#13;
at $0.62 million, and by households to purchase improved stoves are estimated at $1.2 million.&#13;
Support to CAS Objectives&#13;
4.4 The project will provide an economic and sustainable supply of energy for households&#13;
living mainly in N'Djamena. It is an operational instrument of the Bank's Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) adopted in February 1996 and supports four of the CAS's objectives: poverty&#13;
alleviation, rural and private sector development and environmental protection. The key&#13;
objective of the resource management component is to ensure an economic and sustainable&#13;
supply of energy for households living in N'Djamena. This is accomplished through an&#13;
approach that encourages the development of ownership and usufruct rights of natural&#13;
resources through voluntary community based management, while promoting environmental&#13;
awareness. The main objective of the DSMP component is to improve the efficiency of&#13;
cooking fuels through the introduction of improved energy efficient stoves which reduce&#13;
energy consumption.&#13;
4.5 Project evaluation assesses: (a) the cost-effectiveness of the RMP, as the least cost&#13;
alternative for providing energy for households living in N'Djamena; (b) the economic&#13;
justification for investments both in the RMP and in the DSMP components; and (c) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

impacts of uncertainties on the net benefits. In addition to the RMP analysis, the computation&#13;
of natural resource user fees, distributional impact assessment on rural and urban households&#13;
and the fiscal impact of the proposed project have been carried out.&#13;
Project as the least-cost alternative&#13;
4.6 Project Altematives. The following four alternatives to the project for supplying energy&#13;
to households in N'Djamena were assessed. The relevant assumptions and the detailed cost&#13;
comparison of supply alternatives are presented in Annex 4.1 and Annex 4.2.&#13;
4.7 Alternative 1: harvesting wood from more productive resource areas (particularly&#13;
around Sahr in Southern Chad, about 500 km from N'Djamena) and transporting it to&#13;
N'Djamena through fluvial transport. Under this scenario, wood will be exploited as a non-&#13;
renewable resource, starting from 2007 when the capital stock of wood is noticeably reduced&#13;
in the N'Djamena area.&#13;
4.8 Alternative 2: continuing to harvest wood from the main roadways leading to&#13;
N'Djamena and progressively moving further away as accessible supplies diminish. All wood&#13;
fuel is transported by road which by 2003 will result in an increased price of wood fuels of&#13;
more than 10%. UJnder this scenario, no change in conversion techniques is foreseen and&#13;
natural resources are mined until they are exhausted. This is the usual scenario that would&#13;
occur without such a project. There are no incentives for villagers to manage woodlands&#13;
properly. Simply granting them property rights will not automatically imply change for the&#13;
better. One of the reasons is that a system to enforce property rights does not currently exist.&#13;
4.9 Alternative 3: planting of trees andlor establishing plantations to compensate for&#13;
harvested trees now, to replenish reduced stocks after eight to ten years. A combination of&#13;
village plantations and forestry department plantations is implemented, using local tree&#13;
species, such as Prosopis Juliflora, or any other species that has a successful track record in&#13;
Chad. Full demand for wood energy would be satisfied from plantations by 2007. Plantations&#13;
will be established immediately under a project and managed by villagers. This is a&#13;
hypothetical case, as World Bank forestry policy does not support investments in wood&#13;
plantations in this part of the world due to climatic reasons.&#13;
4.10 Alternative 4: substituting commercial fuels (kerosene) when fuelwood stocks are drawn&#13;
down-i.e., when the least costly supply of wood fuels in areas near demand centers are&#13;
exhausted, around 2007.&#13;
4.1 1 As indicated in table 4. 1, the proposed RMP is the least cost alternative for supplying&#13;
wood fuel and charcoal to N'Djamena. The best alternative to the proposed project would be&#13;
to transport wood fuel by truck and continue to mine it further along the roads until the&#13;
resource base has disappeared: this is the situation without the project. Table 4.1 only&#13;
provides cost elements of the alternative scenarios. The alternatives other than the proposed&#13;
project and the plantations do not offer additional economic benefits and do not address wider&#13;
issues such as achieving sustainable natural resource management and supporting livelihood&#13;
of rural communities.&#13;

ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
4.12 Cost Benefit Analysis: Detailed analysis was carried out based on satellite data and a&#13;
model to project the state of the resource base in the with and the without case I I was&#13;
developed. As presented in Annexes 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, both the RMP and DSMP project&#13;
components are economically very sound, with ERRs' of 25.1 percent and 75.1 percent,&#13;
respectively. These ERRs' are quite favorable even though conservative assumptions were&#13;
used for analysis. Using a discount rate of 12 percent and an evaluation period of 20 years,&#13;
the RMP has a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$ 5.3 million and the DSMP has a NPV of $6.1&#13;
million. The ERR for the project as a whole amounts to 34.4 percent.&#13;
4.13 Resource Management Benefits. The RMP will support activities to slow down the rate&#13;
of forest degradation through the introduction of land-use management systems with&#13;
improved transformation techniques (woodcutting, charcoaling). This will be done by making&#13;
rural communities responsible for the village forest land, while assisting them to get organized&#13;
and by changing the regulatory framework for the subsector so that it fully supports them in&#13;
carrying out their responsibilities (paras. 3.5 to 3.18). Benefits will accrue due to transport&#13;
savings and avoided agricultural productivity losses such as from fruit trees, agricultural&#13;
produce, and livestock. 12 The main benefits from the project, accounting for about two-thirds&#13;
of the benefits, will be savings in transport costs as the project will allow a sustainable supply&#13;
of wood fuels in areas closer to N'Djamena. Without the project, there would be continued&#13;
unsustainable harvesting of wood fuel, and production of charcoal, in a collection radius of 15&#13;
kilometers along easily accessible roads at even larger distance from N'Djamena.&#13;

12 Conservative assumptions were selected: transport benefits are counted for only 80% of expected&#13;
transport savings and agricultural productivity benefits for only 50% of expected benefits.&#13;

4.14 The present value (PV, at 12% discount rate) of the benefits of the RMP component is&#13;
estimated at $10. 1 million of which $7.6 million are related to transport savings and about&#13;
$2.6 million to avoid productivity losses, are the principal benefits. Improvements on soil&#13;
fertility/crop production and reduced harvesting of fruit trees have a PV of $1.6 million and&#13;
$3.0 million, respectively for each, with an additional $0.50 million from benefits from&#13;
increased fodder production on livestock. Through the promotion of appropriate natural&#13;
resource managernent, continued harvesting along main roads will be supplanted by forestry&#13;
resources nearer urban demand centers which are developed and managed by rural&#13;
communities. There are also additional benefits which are not as tangible or quantifiable as&#13;
the above benefits due to impacts on microclimates, soil, wind, and water erosion and their&#13;
impact on sylviculture, agriculture and livestock. These benefits have not been estimated.&#13;
The RMP ERR is estimated at 25.1%. The sensitivity analysis shows that this ERR is very&#13;
robust (Figure 4. 1).&#13;
4.15 Demand Side Management Benefits. The quantifiable benefits of the DSM component&#13;
are reduced use of cooking fuels, wood fuel and charcoal, through the introduction of more&#13;
efficient cooking equipment. Rational use of wood and charcoal will be encouraged through&#13;
the introduction of improved stoves, or by increased use of substitute fuels, such as kerosene&#13;
and LPG. Improved stoves will also emit less smoke, particulates, and carbon monoxide than&#13;
existing models. This will have a positive effect on the lives of women and children as they&#13;
will have a reduced burden for fuel collection and as well experience a healthier cooking&#13;
environment. Reductions in negative health impacts were not estimated. The NPV of the&#13;
DSM benefits is conservatively estimated at $6.1 million, resulting in an ERR of about 75.1&#13;
percent. The sensitivity analysis shows that this ERR is also very robust (Figure 4.2).&#13;
4.16 Environmental Benefits. The project produces global environmental benefits beyond&#13;
savings in agricultural productivity through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as a&#13;
result of reduced household fuel consumption. Estimates of avoided CO2 emissions due to a&#13;
reduction of wood fuel use amount to about 1.2 million ton over a 20-year period. Global&#13;
environmental benefits or avoided C02 emissions, valued at about 10 US$ per ton13, give an&#13;
NPV of $2.9 million. This estimate is rather conservative as it is based on fuel savings alone,&#13;
and does not include savings from more efficient charcoaling techniques, reduced&#13;
deforestation, or a reduction in transport needs. Annex 4.4 provides more details about C02&#13;
abatement.&#13;
USER FEE&#13;
4.17 The price of wood should provide consumers with an incentive to use it efficiently and&#13;
avoid non-economic uses, and should induce producers to supply it and maintain the existing&#13;
natural resources. The current price is below the economic cost of wood which should&#13;
include the marginal costs of cutting, preparation, transformation, transport and distribution,&#13;
and, the user value of wood. Without the project, wood fuels will be supplied through clear&#13;
cutting and mining of resources at ever increasing distance from N'Djamena. This method of&#13;
supply entails productivity losses, and, when there is no longer sufficient wood, users will&#13;
need to use substitute fuels, such as kerosene, LPG, or biomass derived alternatives such as&#13;
briquettes made from agricultural residues. The present value of these effects is a measure of&#13;

the scarcity value of wood now, also known as the depletion premium or user fee, which was&#13;
estimated at about $3.35 per ton of wood (574 CFAF per stere).&#13;
4.18 The user fee depends on the: (a) remaining wood reserves; (b) level and growth of&#13;
demand for wood; (c) volume of the deficit; (d) end-user prices of substitutes in the future;&#13;
and (e) productivity losses. The nearer the date the deficit occurs, the higher the depletion&#13;
allowance. In the context of the appraisal of renewable projects, the principle of the depletion&#13;
allowance dictates that the cost of wood should include a premium that, when spread across&#13;
the wood saved by the project (avoided deficit) over its lifetime, would promote an optimal&#13;
supply and use of the natural resource.&#13;
4.19 The project will promote a differentiated userfee based on the damage done to the&#13;
natural resource base. In unmanaged zones (without a rural market, yellow zones), the user&#13;
fee will be CFAF 600 per stere of wood, or per bag of charcoal (which uses about one stere of&#13;
wood to produce) or CFAF 1.5 per kg (Annex 4.5). In managed zones (with a rural market,&#13;
green zones), the user fee will be CFAF 300 or CFAF 7.5 per kg (Annex 4.5), reflecting only&#13;
costs of control, monitoring and creation of more rural markets, and more efficient use and&#13;
transformation of resources. This level of fees should be sufficient to obtain the desired&#13;
benefits, and the average user fee (over all wood consumed, from green and yellow zones)&#13;
will be about CFAF 318, taking into account collection efficiencies and geographical&#13;
distribution of supply. This level of proposed fees corresponds to the actual tax level. The&#13;
forestry law provides the possibility to change the level of fees at least once a year, or when&#13;
required for economic reasons (para. 3.11).&#13;
4.20 The user fee will in principle be collected at source, starting with rural markets that&#13;
begin to operate. As not all zones are immediately converted into managed areas and have&#13;
established a rural market, collection will also be done at entry into N'Djamena, at a higher&#13;
rate that reflects additional costs for its collection as well as costs for converting areas into&#13;
green zones. Over time, the rationale for applying the user fee will disappear (as more areas&#13;
become under management), and its level will automatically be lowered. The user fee will&#13;
cause average retail prices to increase about 10 percent by 2010, which is much less than what&#13;
would happen in the "business as usual" scenario where the price increase would be greater&#13;
than 16 percent. The 10 percent price increase can easily be offset by the use of improved&#13;
stoves which should reduce fuel consumption by at least twenty percent. The actual retail&#13;
price will be an average of the three supply alternatives (green zones, yellow zones, and&#13;
entering the city by circumventing the control system). Table 4.2 presents the economic costs&#13;
of charcoal in N'Djamena, according to the supply mode. The revenue generated from the&#13;
introduction of user fees is sufficient to cover project costs and pay back in about a twelve&#13;
year period. It gives a boost in rural revenue generation (which in itself is a good incentive to&#13;
pursue the resource management).&#13;

FINANCIAL AND FISCAL ANALYSIS&#13;
4.21 Under conservative assumptions, the project will generate revenue sufficient to&#13;
reimburse project public financing in about twelve years. The financial internal rate of return&#13;
is about 6.9% (Annex 4.6). Initially user fees will be collected at city entrance as wood fuel&#13;
and charcoal will come from unoccupied zones, but gradually in the rural markets where&#13;
resources are managed. The collection efficiency in rural markets will be much higher than at&#13;
the city entrance due to involvement of the local people. It is estimated that over 24% of the&#13;
wood flow at the end of the second year will be controlled (subject to user fee collection),&#13;
increasing to 46% at the end of the project which amounts to a total fee collected of $568,000&#13;
in 2001 to $856,000 four years later. The rate of increase in the total user fee collected rises&#13;
rapidly thereafter. Costs of control will be self-finance early on, possibly starting in year two.&#13;
Participating rural villages will generate approximately $265,000 over the four year life of the&#13;
project (discounted at 12%); this is over and above the money they will receive from the sale&#13;
of wood and charcoal. Although these financial transactions are not important for the&#13;
economic evaluation of the project, they are extremely important for the population in the&#13;
project area.&#13;
DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACT&#13;
4.22 Of total net project benefits, an estimated 42.0% go to the urban poor and 28.4% remains&#13;
in rural areas as a result of increased productivity, higher efficiencies, and proceeds of user&#13;
fees. Table 4.3 provides for the distribution of costs and benefits. Almost 10 percent of the&#13;
net benefits go to the poorest urban households. Firewood and charcoal prices are expected to&#13;
increase by about 4.4% and 10.3% respectively, which can easily be offset by using an&#13;
improved stove. Even the investments in improved stoves will be recovered within a two-&#13;
month period through reduced fuel consumption. Although the user fee is netted out from the&#13;
economic evaluation, it is quite important as a net transfer from the rich to the poor occurs,&#13;
giving incentives for all economic actors to behave more rationally.&#13;

4.23 Rural Communities. Substantial financial benefits will accrue to poor households in&#13;
rural communities with a natural resource management plan, through the collection of user&#13;
fees and the participation in natural resource income generating activities. Under the&#13;
proposed project, services from wood cutters, wood transporters (from harvesting place to the&#13;
rural market site), wood stackers, rural market managers, etc. will be required which translates&#13;
into economic opportunities for many villagers. The total value of the 1995 wood fuel market&#13;
in N'Djamena was estimated at approximately US$ 11 million of which a maximum of 20%&#13;
accruing to the producers (who are not necessarily rural villagers). In fact, a large portion of&#13;
this value is for distribution margins by urban commerce. The project seeks to increase the&#13;
allocation for rural stakeholders to about 25 to 35 percent of the economic value of wood&#13;
fuels. Gains are achieved through avoided productivity losses as well though higher income&#13;
groups tend to benefit to a greater extent than poorer income groups.&#13;
4.24 For urban households, distributional effects are relatively minor as all income groups&#13;
benefit through efficiency gains and lower priced energy than what would have been the case&#13;
under the business as usual scenario. While operational costs increase, as a result of applied&#13;
management techniques for natural resources, benefits from fuel and transport savings&#13;
outweigh these increased operational costs through lower priced wood fuel and charcoal.&#13;
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
4.25 Figure 4.1 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis for the RMP and figure 4.2 for the&#13;
DSMP. Both components thus appear very robust against the risks and uncertainties that may&#13;
affect their economic performance. The figures display the changes (shown in the Y axis) in&#13;
each of the cost and benefit streams for the component to yield a given ERR (the X axis). The&#13;

ERR.&#13;
4.26 The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that significant changes must result before the ERR&#13;
of either project component would drop below the 12 percent benchmark. For the RMP&#13;
component, the ERR would not drop below the 12 percent benchmark unless either&#13;
investment costs increased by more than 150 percent, operational and control costs increased&#13;
by more than 900 percent, transport costs declined by more than 70 percent, or the agricultural&#13;
productivity gains declined by more than 200 percent. For the DSMP component, the 12&#13;
percent benchmark would not be reached until investment costs rose above 600 percent, the&#13;
cost of the improved stoves increased by more than 500 percent, or fuel savings declined by&#13;
more than 70 percent (figures are approximations).&#13;

PROJECT RISKS&#13;
4.27 The principal risks surrounding the implementation of the proposed project includes the:&#13;
limited capability of the GOC; non-cooperative villages and conflicting land tenure systems&#13;
which limit the access to wood-producing areas; possibility that fraudulent practices (by the&#13;
army or police forces) might limit the efficiency of the wood fuel monitoring system into&#13;
N'Djamena; and social obstacles that may arise in implementing fiscal reform, which could&#13;
result in higher wood prices to the consumer.&#13;
4.28 The up-front commitment of GOC to proceed with reforms is a good indicator of the&#13;
political will to support this operation. During preparation of the project, these risks were&#13;
addressed by: conducting several participatory studies to verify and maximize villagers'&#13;
willingness to cooperate; designing a simple and transparent system to monitor the origin and&#13;
flows of wood fuels; providing financial incentives for most actors in the sector; developing a&#13;
participatory approach to project design; and limiting the role of GOC in project&#13;
implementation, complemented with the increased participation of non-governmental&#13;
organizations, local communities, and the private sector.&#13;
4.29 The user fee system has been designed to limit fraudulent practices and obtain higher&#13;
benefits for all involved. Legitimate transporters will now have proof that they should not pay&#13;
any "informal" taxes along the way and may have recourse if the old system persists. Sultans&#13;
have an incentive to get as many rural markets in operation in their Canton, as the derived&#13;
benefits will rapidly exceed what he would have received otherwise.&#13;

Forest Resources&#13;
Detailed resource data are now available for the N'Djamena area, based on satellite&#13;
imagery (7 scenes, using SPOT 3 with recordings in September 1995 and November 1994).&#13;
In addition a two-week ground truthing period in November 1995 was carried out to assess&#13;
provisional forest classes, measure sample sites to provide estimates of biomass yield by&#13;
forest type, and assess the value of different wood species to calibrate the satellite data. These&#13;
data are sufficient for a first order estimate of the availability of resources in the N'Djamena&#13;
wood catchment area. This recent study confirms previous observation: degradation and&#13;
deforestation are increasing, but there is still enough resource left to maintain woodfuel as&#13;
N'Djamena's primary energy source, on condition that current trends are reversed quickly.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF CHAD&#13;
HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT&#13;
Forests - Institutional Framework&#13;
1.     Land tenure. In Chad as in many other Sub-Saharan countries, land tenure is&#13;
complicated as the official law, Islamic law, and traditional laws prevail simultaneously.&#13;
Official laws are the published laws, approved by the government; Islamic law dictates that a&#13;
person is free to harvest natural resources for his own use, free of charge, as natural resources&#13;
are shared by all living in the society. Traditional laws are more like traditions practiced by&#13;
local sultans, village chiefs, etc., small rents are paid by villagers for the use of natural&#13;
resources. In many cases these laws are applied without problems, but problems arise where&#13;
laws from the different systems compete. A good example is the wood fuel exploitation:&#13;
central authorities provide transporters with a permit to cut wood in certain villages, without&#13;
consent of (without even discussing with) the villagers who claim it to be their own resource.&#13;
2.     Forest Legislation. A major factor constraining improved land management is the&#13;
ambiguity of rights to land use and ownership. While current legislation stipulates that the&#13;
land belongs to the state, it also recognizes certain land-use and property rights of traditional&#13;
groups or individuals. Two main problems have resulted from this ambiguity: (a) private&#13;
groups that harvest forest resources for commercial purposes are not concerned about&#13;
sustaining the resource base because they feel no sense of ownership; (b) forest agents place&#13;
no restrictions on the wood harvesting by private parties; and (c) villagers can not deny&#13;
woodcutters access to the forest resources within their territory. In essence, forest&#13;
administration reflects current practice more than the legislation and much of commercial&#13;
wood activity escapes taxation since the monitoring of forest offtake and transport is&#13;
sporadic.&#13;
3.     Institutional Framework. Chad's forestry staff is insufficient in number and in&#13;
expertise to effectively manage its forest resource base. There are only 283 professional staff&#13;
allocated among various staff categories (Table below). The staff chiefly responsible for field&#13;
execution of forestry programs, the technical advisors and their agents, account for only 16&#13;
percent of total staff, which implies on average 29,000 km2 of territory to monitor per&#13;
forestry agent. The forestry aides, contractual surveyors, and various forestry officers often&#13;
have a low level of technical skills. To develop a competent, motivated staff, GOC needs to&#13;
establish several types of training programs, local and foreign, for all levels of forestry&#13;
services. In addition, the focus of involvement should change away from control and&#13;
policing, to extension and providing advise. Responsibility for maintaining wood resources&#13;
should be given to rural villages, which is in their daily interest. Forestry staff should assist&#13;
villagers to develop management systems that allow them to do this efficiently.&#13;

4.     Fiscal Regime. The current fiscal regime in the forestry sector is neither sufficient&#13;
for resource management nor for revenue collection. Anyone may engage in wood commerce&#13;
by paying related forestry fees and purchasing a cutting permit. GOC's Department of&#13;
Forestry grants permits on a monthly basis and determines the forestry fee based on the&#13;
estimated number of trips to the forested area and the quantities taken; these estimates are&#13;
usually far from reality. After obtaining the permit it is possible to cut wood in any rural area&#13;
within a given zone. The field monitoring of forest exploitation is practically nonexistent and&#13;
it is easy to circumvent permit control.&#13;
5.     The estimated rate of revenue recovery is only about 10-15 percent. Forestry staff are&#13;
insufficient for the monitoring required. A better rate of revenue collection could generate the&#13;
funds necessary to finance management services or technical support in the wood production&#13;
zones. To address weaknesses in the fiscal regime, the ESMAP study recommended that the&#13;
Government establish a new fiscal and regulatory system based on: a fee level that reflects the&#13;
cost of wood replacement; the channeling of the proceeds from fee collection to managers and&#13;
owners of forest resources (i.e. villages); and incentives for reinvesting revenues from fees in&#13;
forest management activities and reforestation.&#13;

Energy Prices and Household Use of Fuels&#13;
Energy Prices&#13;
1.    Woodfuels. The woodfuels market, which amounts to over US$ 20 million per year,&#13;
operates through numerous private operators who set prices based on laws of demand and&#13;
supply. The main pricing issue for woodfuels is that the producer price of wood does not&#13;
reflect the economic cost of producing wood, resulting in overexploitation of resources.&#13;
Taxes levied on firewood and charcoal do not correct this deficiency. Illegal and&#13;
unsustainable harvesting of woodfuel resources is in large part the cause of this problem as&#13;
woodfuel is mined as a common property resource and thus in large part goes unvalued.&#13;
Furthermore, it is difficult to estimate the true wood value at the present time given omissions&#13;
in the existing data base.&#13;
2.    Petroleum Products. The Government fixes the prices petroleum products based on&#13;
the cost structure of the operations of the GPP, which purchases the products from the various&#13;
refineries in the West Africa region, Nigeria, or on the international market. Prices in the&#13;
parallel market are about 15-30 percent below official prices, partly because some operators&#13;
bypass import duties and taxes. Petroleum product taxes are high and vary according to&#13;
product: CFAF 112 per liter for gasoline; CFAF 62 per liter for diesel oil; and no taxes on&#13;
kerosene. The price of kerosene is CFAF 270 per liter, and LPG CFAF 600 per kg. LPG&#13;
doubled in price since 1994, where as the price of kerosene remained relatively stable: it was&#13;
CFAF 225 in 1993, and CFAF 240 in 1991.&#13;
3.     Electricity Tariffs. Chad's electricity tariffs are very high: the average price of&#13;
electricity for low-voltage consumers is CFAF 170 (US$ 0.34) per kWh (for a consumption of&#13;
about 150 kWh/month), and respectively CFAF 108, CFAF 200, and CFAF 84 for medium&#13;
voltage customers during normal, peak, and low hours. The reasons for this high price are the&#13;
low demand on the system, the use of expensive high speed diesel generators, the poor&#13;
condition of the distribution network, high losses, and the weak institutional structure of the&#13;
subsector. The tariff includes a social safety net for the energy charges (the first 30 kWh @&#13;
CFAF 83/kWh, the next 60 kWh @ CFAF 197/kWh, the following 60 kWh @ CFAF&#13;
177/kWh, and above that @ CFAF 201 /kWh. Added to these energy charges are 11 % tax, I %&#13;
surcharge, and maintenance costs and rent for the meter.&#13;
4.    Charcoal Prices. Charcoal prices are around 40-50 CFAF per kg. These prices are&#13;
comparable to those of other West African countries in the Sahelian region. According to the&#13;
1992 survey, there is a significant correlation in the price per bundle for woodfuels and the&#13;
distance of the sales point from the capital. For example, the average price per bundle of&#13;
wood is CFAF 10.6 per kg at a distance of 20 km but at a distance of 100 km, it declines by 30&#13;
percent to CFAF 7.6 per kg. For charcoal, which sells by the sack, the price 100 km from the&#13;
N'Djamena is 20 CFAF per kg, 40 percent lower than the price at 20 km from the capital, 32.3&#13;
CFAF per kg. The prices that the wood merchants pay from the village supply sources varies&#13;
as well, with the price of a truckload of wood ranging between CFAF 15,000 and 20,000,&#13;
averaging CFAF 1.9 per kg. In 1995, the retail price of wood is slightly higher than in 1992,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

at around CFAF 20 - 24 per kg. The devaluation of the CFAF did have a major impact on the&#13;
retail price of charcoal, which increased sharply to about CFAF 80 per kg in 1995.&#13;

HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT&#13;
Process To Create Resource Management Systems&#13;
Box 1: The Main Stages in the Creation of a Rural Woodfuel Market&#13;
I) Information Campaign&#13;
national: tv, radio, brochure&#13;
at village level: visit by a project agent&#13;
"Presentation of the new legalframework enabling villages to&#13;
manage their own woodland areas (brush management)"&#13;
result: candidate villages&#13;
II) Selection of Candidate Villages&#13;
further information about rural markets and the management structure&#13;
rough assessment of resources, sociological survey&#13;
result: initial choice of village&#13;
III) Final Selection of Initial Villages&#13;
detailed studies: woodcutter/woodharvester/charcoaler/tenures/&#13;
pasture surveys, negotiation between and within villages on&#13;
forest boundaries, inventory of resources and productivity&#13;
result: choice of priority regions&#13;
IV) Support for the Development of a Rural market Structure&#13;
help villages set up management structure, preparation of statutes and regulations&#13;
election of members of the management structure and&#13;
training of managers, general manager, treasurer, chairman&#13;
negotiation of annual harvesting sales-quota&#13;
result: creation of local management structure and&#13;
appllication for official approval by DFPE and launching of activities&#13;
V) Official Approval&#13;
approval of the rural market, signature of long-terrn contract with DFPE&#13;
setting of legal forest boundaries&#13;
promulgation of the act of rural concessions&#13;
information to local and national professionals in the fuel wood commodity chain&#13;
distribution of coupons (tax receipts to be handed out to transporters) to&#13;
the local management structure&#13;
VI) Support and Supervision&#13;
market should run independently as soon as possible, initially assistance may be required&#13;
organizat:ionaVadministrative/technical/commercial/accounting/fmancial support&#13;
a posteriori supervision, levying of taxes by the administration&#13;
annual quota reassessment&#13;
(possible operational modifications)&#13;
&#13;

Progress in the Creation of Rural Wood Markets and Management Plans: evolution of&#13;
the retail prices of fuelwood and charcoal in the N'Djamena market; number of rural markets&#13;
set up within the supply basin for wood energy in N'Djamena; rate that rural markets&#13;
sufficiently cover forested areas within the priority zones identified by the wood management&#13;
plan for N'Djamena; producer price of wood and charcoal in green zones compared to yellow&#13;
&amp; red zones; and of woodfuels supplied from green zones compared to the other zones,&#13;
including how much of urban demand these sales represent.&#13;
Monitor of Wood Products Flow: monthly change in the rate GOC recovers taxes on wood&#13;
for energy, based on the data of various monitoring stations to be set up in N'Djamena; and&#13;
amount of tax revenues collected annually in the rural markets, benefiting local communities.&#13;
Effectiveness of increasing the Efficacy of Household Fuel Use Program: monthly sales&#13;
of improved firewood, charcoal, kerosene, and LPG stoves in N'Djamena; increase in the&#13;
share of households actually using improved stoves in N'Djamena; estimated real savings that&#13;
accrue to households from the use of improved stoves; and increased supply and use of&#13;
modem fuels.&#13;
Project Management: extent to which AEDE will be able to autofinance; implementation&#13;
according to project documents.&#13;
A table with more fully developed indicators on a year-by-year basis is presented on the next&#13;

REPUBLIC OF CHAD&#13;
HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT&#13;
Basic Assumptions and Demand Scenario&#13;
(i) All tables range from year 1998 through 2017, although some of the middle columns are&#13;
not printed for space limitations.&#13;
(ii) The border price oe kerosene is taken as the economic value. The border price is CFAF&#13;
166, which is of the same order of magnitude of other landlocked Sahelian countries.&#13;
However, the official price structure in Chad allows for a retail price of CFAF 260, based on&#13;
imports from Yaounde, Cameroon. Even allowing for a higher purchase price due to low&#13;
quantities, and allowing for high transport cost provisions, the official price structure is too&#13;
high. Prices are projected according to World Bank commodity forecast figures.&#13;
(iii) All costs and benefits are discounted at 12%.&#13;
&#13;

HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT&#13;
Avoided C02 Emissions&#13;
Avoided C02 emissions have not been incorporated in the analysis, although they are a real,&#13;
though global benefit, that can be obtained by implementing the project. A total of some 1.05&#13;
million tons of carbon will be avoided over a 20 year period, mainly from a reduction of&#13;
woodfuel consurnption, and of better wood management and carbonization techniques. As a&#13;
first order estimate, emissions related to the fuel consumption of the with/without situation&#13;
are calculated, assuming that there is no difference in deforestation (this is a very&#13;
conservative estimate, as the "with" situation will be characterized by a reduced&#13;
deforestation, and thus reduced emissions.&#13;
Current GEF guidelines prescribe a willingness to invest in C02 mitigation activities to the&#13;
tune of about US$10 per avoided ton of C02. Applying this value to the flow of avoided&#13;
emissions gives a net benefit of about 2.9 million (NPV). Alternatively, an equivalent&#13;
avoided cost of about $6.2 per ton of C02 would be applied to the project if GEF were&#13;
willing to finance the total project costs.&#13;

            Chad - Household Energy Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Household Energy Project aims to
            provide an economic and sustainable supply of energy for
            households in Chad. The project comprises four components
            that will be implemented over four years: 1) establishing
            village-based natural resources management--this component
            builds the capacity to design simple long-term village
            land-use and wood exploitation plans for villages in the
            N'Djamena wood fuel catchment area by funding the
            technical assistance for nongovernmental organizations,
            forestry agents, and villagers to develop a master plan and
            thereafter manage and control fuelwood use; 2) building the
            capacity of the Agency for Household Energy and Environment
            to monitor and control wood product flow through charging
            collecting user fees/taxes; 3) improving the efficiency of
            household fuel use by commercializing efficient cooking
            stoves (firewood, charcoal); and promoting the use of
            low-cost kerosene and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) stoves with
            publicity and NGO-sponsored promotional activities as well
            as testing, product development, and monitoring of stove
            performance; and 4) capacity building and training as a part
            of project management.
