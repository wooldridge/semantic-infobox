Republic of Rwanda a credit in an amount equivalent to SDR 47, 900, 000. The purpose of said credit is&#13;
to support the Government of Rwanda's efforts to consolidate, enhance efficiency and effectiveness, and&#13;
expand the coverage of the social protection system.&#13;
1.    The member of the Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a&#13;
credit, and of the purpose to which the proceeds of the credit are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The member of the Committee is of the opinion that the program in support of which the&#13;
proceeds of such credit are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth in&#13;
Article I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the economic&#13;
development of the Republic of Rwanda and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of&#13;
the Republic of Rwanda.&#13;
