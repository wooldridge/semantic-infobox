1. THE SECTOR&#13;
A. SECTORAL HISTORY AND CONDITIONS&#13;
Country Background&#13;
I. I   After several decades of war and disunity, Viet Nam was unified under socialism in&#13;
1975. In 1989, Government launched a successful program of adjustment and reform&#13;
("Doi Moi"), with the aim of achieving macroeconomic structural reform, liberalization&#13;
and stabilization   Structural reforms included the decollectivization of agriculture,&#13;
liberalization of prices and foreign trade, and contraction of state enterprises and subsidies.&#13;
Under this program, real annual GDP growth has averaged 7 percent, inflation rates and&#13;
the fiscal deficit have been substantially reduced, and exports have grown by more than 30&#13;
percent per annum to become a leading sector in the economy. Prospects for the coming&#13;
decade are bright.&#13;
1.2   Viet Nam also continues to benefit from many positive legacies of the decades of&#13;
socialist rule. The distribution of consumption is relatively equal by comparison with&#13;
other countries, and an impressive network of basic social services has been put in place&#13;
over the past three decades. As a result, 88 percent of all adults are literate, including 84&#13;
percent of adult women, while 78 percent of children aged 6-10 years are enrolled in&#13;
primary school. Life expectancy is currently estimated at around 67 years and infant&#13;
mortality at around 40 per 1,000 live births. More than 94 percent of children survive&#13;
their first five years of life.&#13;
1.3   However, Viet Nam still remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a&#13;
per capita income estimated at under US$200. About one quarter of the population is too&#13;
poor to afford an adequate daily basic food intake, and more than half of all young&#13;
children are stunted. Between 40 and 50 percent of the population are below a poverty&#13;
line that includes expenses for both food and non-food basic needs.  Though the&#13;
adjustment and reform program provided much more broadly-based benefits than in other&#13;
transition economies because of the dominant role of family-based agriculture, and though&#13;
its social costs have been relatively mild, the poorest groups are still disadvantaged and&#13;
likely to lag behind without continuing special attention. A combination of broad-based&#13;
economic growth with continued access for the poor to basic social services will be&#13;
essential for long-term national economic development and poverty reduction.&#13;
1.4   Reduction of population growth will make a vital contribution to both economic&#13;
growth and poverty alleviation. Viet Nam's population now stands at around 73 million, a&#13;
35 percent increase over the 54 million enumerated in the census of 1979 shortly after&#13;
reunification. Pressure on the country's agricultural and forest land is acute. Despite&#13;
recent falls in fertility, the population is still growing at over 2 percent per annum, due to a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
combination of extremely low mortality with the large cohorts in the young reproductive&#13;
ages resulting from past high fertility.  If this rate of growth were maintained, the&#13;
population would double within the next 33 years. Dependency ratios are also still high,&#13;
resulting in heavy costs in education and child health care relative to productive capacity.&#13;
Fertility urgently needs to be reduced to replacement level and maintained there if Viet&#13;
Nam's productive potential is to be maximized.&#13;
1.5    Viet Nam's development strategy is directed at five specific objectives: (1) to&#13;
maintain macroeconomic stability; (2) to make a steady transition to an open market&#13;
economy; (3) to improve basic infrastructure; (4) to alleviate poverty and reduce regional&#13;
inequalities; (5) to preserve the nation's natural resource base so that economic&#13;
achievements can be sustained over the long term. Development of the population and&#13;
health sectors is closely linked to the objectives of poverty alleviation, reduction of&#13;
regional inequalities and natural resource sustainability.&#13;
Sector History and Status&#13;
1.6    Health Status. Viet Nam has achieved an extraordinarily low level of mortality&#13;
for its income and stage of development. Nevertheless, its main health problems remain&#13;
those common to most developing countries.  Infectious and parasitic diseases,&#13;
particularly TB, malaria and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), are still a substantial&#13;
threat to the population at large.  Among children, the communicable diseases of&#13;
childhood have declined rapidly in incidence and severity following the success of the&#13;
Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI), but ARIs and diarrheal diseases are still major&#13;
killers of children and constitute their most important health problems. Nearly 60 percent&#13;
of infant deaths are due to these two groups of diseases.  Severe and acute child&#13;
malnutrition is now very uncommon, but chronic undernutrition manifested as stunting is&#13;
still the fate of the majority. Among infants, prematurity, low birthweight and problems in&#13;
delivery are also major causes of death and ill-health. For women, pregnancy and delivery&#13;
are still important health risks, with estimates of the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in&#13;
1990 ranging from 110 to over 200 per 100,000 live births. Other major health problems&#13;
for women include a very high prevalence of anaemia, at two thirds of all pregnant&#13;
women, and widespread reproductive tract infections (RTIs). According to the 1993&#13;
World Development Report (WDR) "Investing in Health", the vast bulk of all these&#13;
conditions can be successfully prevented or treated in a highly cost-effective manner&#13;
within a primary health care (PHC) system, backed by appropriate first-level referral&#13;
facilities and selected additional disease control interventions.&#13;
1.7   Primary Health Services. A life expectancy of 67 years could not have been&#13;
achieved in a country as poor and as war-affected as Viet Nam without extremely effective&#13;
basic health services. Viet Nam was in fact one of the pioneers of primary health care (see&#13;
Annex I for a detailed description of the system), and has achieved a vast, dense and staff-&#13;
intensive network of health facilities far exceeding those of its much richer neighbors. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
ratio of the lowest-level health facility (the commune health centre, or CHC) per million&#13;
population is around 170 in Viet Nam, compared with 32 in Indonesia, 63 in China and&#13;
141 in Thailand; each CHC is staffed with about four health workers including an assistant&#13;
doctor, a secondary midwife, a nurse and a pharmacist. Average traveling time to obtain a&#13;
modern contraceptive method (mostly supplied through public facilities) is reported to be&#13;
only 20 minutes. Only three percent of rural households live in communes without a&#13;
CHC, and a Government-financed program of CHC construction plans to fill these gaps&#13;
within the next few years. Similarly, Viet Nam's hospital bed ratio of one per 389 persons&#13;
compares favorably with one per 465 in China, 665 in Thailand and 1,743 in Indonesia.&#13;
1.8    Viet Nam is also performing relatively well in terms of many basic primary health&#13;
care programs, given the lack of adequate financing which continues to be a major&#13;
constraint to full coverage and effectiveness.  According to the 1994 Intercensal&#13;
Demographic Survey (ICDS), seventy five percent of children have received at least one&#13;
immunization. Over 40 percent of pregnant women are receiving full tetanus toxoid&#13;
vaccination. The Control of Diarrheal Diseases (CDD) program, which focuses on use of&#13;
oral rehydration therapy, is being expanded, it now covers over 80 percent of all&#13;
communes and more than half of CHC staff are fully trained. Most mothers are reported&#13;
to maintain or increase normal levels of fluids for children with diarrhea and to continue&#13;
breastfeeding them, although use of packaged oral rehydration salts or home solutions&#13;
itself is still low. The ARI control program is now estimated to cover 40 percent of all&#13;
children across all provinces, though less than a quarter of children yet receive the correct&#13;
antibiotic treatment. According to the 1994 ICDS, 55 percent of mothers receive some&#13;
ante-natal care from a medical or paramedical professional, and nearly 60 percent deliver&#13;
in health facilities. Forty four percent of married women are using a modern family&#13;
planning method.&#13;
1.9   Most of this primary health care was and is delivered at the CHCs and District&#13;
Health Centres (DHCs), which in many ways form a partnership through which DHCs&#13;
supplement and support CHCs through supervision, referral and mobile teams which tour&#13;
CHCs to deliver services beyond the capability of CHC staff For example, the 1994&#13;
ICDS reported that 37 percent of all mothers delivered at CHCs, and another 9 percent at&#13;
DHCs, together making up more than 80 percent of all institutional deliveries. Likewise,&#13;
45 percent of women using modern contraception obtained it at CHCs in 1988 and 44&#13;
percent in 1994, according respectively to the 1988 Viet Nam Demographic and Health&#13;
Survey and the 1994 ICDS.&#13;
I.10  However, the disappearance in recent years of the agricultural cooperative system&#13;
which largely financed and supported CHC staff (see para. 1.13), combined with pressures&#13;
on public expenditure since the late 1980s, has resulted in a marked deterioration of the&#13;
public health service at all levels. This is manifest in dilapidated buildings, acute shortages&#13;
of furniture, equipment and supplies, and low morale and productivity of health workers&#13;
due to declining real salaries and poor working conditions. In some facilities, health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
workers have not only been sleeping on the premises during their duty but staying there&#13;
on a longer-term basis. While there are still no shortages of health staff on paper, except&#13;
for secondary midwives, many health workers are now said to be working only a few&#13;
hours per day in health facilities, in order to supplement their salaries through other&#13;
income-earning activities. At the same time, the cost of using public health care has risen&#13;
through the introduction in 1989 of official user fees for all facilities except CHCs, and&#13;
private health practitioners and pharmacies have been licensed.&#13;
1.11   As a result of all these factors, utilization rates for public health facilities have&#13;
fallen dramatically for clinical and in-patient services. Numbers of annual out-patient&#13;
consultations halved from 2.1 per capita in 1987 to 0.9 in 1993, and numbers of annual&#13;
inpatient admissions fell from 105 per 1,000 population to 68 in 1990. Many CHCs and&#13;
DHCs are said to be catering to less than 10 outpatients seeking minor curative care per&#13;
day, and performing only a few deliveries per month. According to recent data from the&#13;
1992-93 Viet Nam Living Standards Survey (VLSS), one third of the population currently&#13;
go to any health practitioner when sick, with the other two-thirds resorting to self-&#13;
medication. Among the poorest 20 percent of the population, 70 percent self-medicate.&#13;
The degree of substitution between public and private providers over time is not known,&#13;
but of those who do see a health practitioner, more than half currently see a private&#13;
provider; poorer patients are more likely to see a paramedic and richer patients a doctor.&#13;
Among public facilities, the poorest are more likely to visit CHCs and richer groups a&#13;
hospital. Thus the poor gravitate towards the lowest levels of service in both private and&#13;
public sectors for curative care, no doubt because they entail the least immediate direct&#13;
expense.&#13;
1.12   The overall picture is thus of a public health care sector which has reached a&#13;
crossroads. Basic primary health care interventions of a preventive or palliative nature are&#13;
being delivered, but coverage is still well below satisfactory levels and the quality of&#13;
services is uncertain. If facilities and staffing continue to deteriorate, and resources are&#13;
not forthcoming for upgrading and maintaining a well-supplied and well-functioning&#13;
system, it is likely that even these basic PHC services will cease to perform adequately.&#13;
Because of resource constraints and the ready availability of pharmacies, the public system&#13;
is already little used by any section of the population for basic curative care.&#13;
1.13   Financing of Health Services. Data on health expenditure for Viet Nam are&#13;
weak and need further review  and analysis.  However, on the basis of available&#13;
information, it appears that state financing for the public health care system is split&#13;
between central and local government budgets. The centre picks up the costs for central&#13;
and branch hospitals, preventive health care (including the national malaria, TB and ARI&#13;
control programs, EPI and the national MCH program), medical training and medical&#13;
research, amounting all together to about one quarter of the state budget for health. The&#13;
other three-quarters of the budget is spent by local (provincial and district) governments,&#13;
which finance the costs of their respective hospitals with district budgets also picking up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
some costs for CHCs. The salaries of CHC staff and maintenance of CHC facilities were in&#13;
the past supported almost entirely outside the state health budget by the commune&#13;
agricultural cooperatives, through contributions in cash, kind or labor. However the&#13;
collapse of the cooperative system has reduced commune-level financing to derisory&#13;
levels. A decision was therefore made in 1994 to phase in financing of CHC staff salaries&#13;
by the regular state health budget over the next three years, with two-thirds of communes&#13;
covered so far.&#13;
1.14  In 1993, overall state budget expenditures on health amounted to 1,442 billion&#13;
dong (about US$144 million), or some 20,000 dong (US$2) per capita; this was about half&#13;
the budget for education. About 90 percent of this amount was spent on curative care in&#13;
hospitals and only about 2 percent on CHCs. According to the 1992-3 VLSS, another&#13;
7,500 billion (US$750 million) dong were spent directly on health care by households, or&#13;
some 104,000 dongs (US$10) per capita Almost all of this private expenditure went for&#13;
purchase of drugs. Thus total per capita annual health spending in Viet Nam would be&#13;
around US$12, most of it used for medicines.&#13;
1.15  By comparison, the 1993 WDR estimates that a minimal package of essential&#13;
clinical health services would cost about US$8 per capita in a low-income country, all&#13;
calculated to be highly cost-effective and all to be delivered at district and lower levels of&#13;
the health system.  A further basic package of "public health" programs (including&#13;
immunization and family planning), which benefit the entire community and are also highly&#13;
cost-effective, would cost another US$4. The two packages together would make up&#13;
US$12 per capita, or roughly what Viet Nam already spends. It would seem therefore,&#13;
that total health expenditure in Viet Nam could be adequate for basic health needs,&#13;
provided the allocation of spending were appropriate. Since health budgets and data on&#13;
private expenditure in Viet Nam are insufficiently detailed to separate out spending by the&#13;
-R basic needs categories, it is impossible to judge just how appropriate current&#13;
patterns of expenditure actually are. However, it seems extremely likely that too little is&#13;
being spent at the lower levels of public and private health systems and on basic cost-&#13;
effective clinical and "public health" services.&#13;
1.16  Development of Family Planning Policies and Programs.  Concern over&#13;
population growth has a long history in Viet Nam. Rapid population growth in the Red&#13;
River Delta, an area of recurring past food shortages, induced the government in northern&#13;
Viet Nam to promulgate an official population policy as early as 1963. The goals of this&#13;
policy were set as a reduction of the current population growth rate of 3.5 percent to 2&#13;
percent and achievement of an average family size of 2 to 3 children with 5-6 years spacing&#13;
between births. To support the policy, use of condoms and the MJD was promoted and&#13;
abortion services began to be made available at health facilities. No equivalent policies&#13;
were established in southern Viet Nam, where the pronatalist attitudes of the French&#13;
colonial regime and the Catholic church had long been dominant, but family planning&#13;
services were available in urban areas. However the subsequent decade of war severely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
limited resources for family planning throughout the country, though USAID did begin&#13;
funding for population and FP programs in the South in the early 1970s.&#13;
1.17  After reunification, Government took a succession of steps to standardize and&#13;
increase the availability and uptake of family planning throughout Viet Nam, spurred on by&#13;
alarm over the rapid growth of population revealed by the 1979 census. The Family Law&#13;
of 1977 attempted to promote the protection of women's rights, and the Ministry of&#13;
Health (MOH) worked to improve availability of FP and abortion services through public&#13;
sector facilities with help from the Institute for the Protection of Mothers and Newborn&#13;
(IPMN). A cadre of volunteer outreach workers, called "motivators", was also established&#13;
at the hamlet level by various mass organizations, such as the Women's Union, the&#13;
Peasants' Union and the Farmers' Union; their task was to promote the adoption of family&#13;
planning among hamlet families.&#13;
1.18  In 1984, the National Committee for Population and Family Planning (NCPFP)&#13;
was set up to implement the national population policy and to direct the national family&#13;
planning program. A large part of NCPFP's staff was drawn from MOH, and a major&#13;
principle of its mandate was that family planning services would continue to be delivered&#13;
entirely through the health system. The NCPFP was to contract out the actual delivery of&#13;
FP and abortion services to MOH, but would coordinate all population and family&#13;
planning activities in the country and would itself implement a nationwide program to&#13;
promote family planning through social mobilization efforts. To this end, a network of&#13;
subsidiary committees was established at provincial (PCPFPs), district (DCPFPs) and&#13;
commune (CPFPBs) level, all with participation of the corresponding level of People's&#13;
Committees, mass organizations and health authorities.&#13;
1.19  In 1988, Viet Nam officially introduced a national "one-child or two-child" policy,&#13;
formalizing a system of childbearing guidelines, free provision of contraceptives and&#13;
abortion, and economic incentives and disincentives. Following the licensing of a private&#13;
health sector, FP and abortion services also became openly available through the private&#13;
sector, though public facilities are still by far the most important providers. In 1993, the&#13;
NCPFP set up its own nationwide cadre of hamlet-level outreach workers called&#13;
"collaborators", who receive a small allowance plus performance-based incentives for the&#13;
promotion of family planning, including distribution of condoms and oral contraceptives.&#13;
Annex 2 provides a detailed description of the entire current system of family planning&#13;
activities.&#13;
1.20  Donor Activities. Several donors have been active in the population and family&#13;
planning fields in Viet Nam. USAID provided some support in the south during the early&#13;
1970s, but this ceased in 1975 and has not been resumed to date. The major donor since&#13;
reunification has been UNFPA, who are now nearing the end of their fourth year country&#13;
assistance cycle and have been contributing about US$4-5 million per year to the FP&#13;
program. They have provided assistance for a full range of population and family planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
activities, comprising demographic and FP data collection and research (including the&#13;
1989 census, the 1988 Viet Nam Demographic and Health Survey, and the 1994&#13;
Intercensal Demographic Survey), FP/MCH services, contraceptive supplies and&#13;
equipment, IEC (including population education), training and MIS. The fifth country&#13;
cycle is currently under preparation. Other donors in the field include UNICEF, GTZ,&#13;
Australia and various NGOs, who have mainly supported small projects in selected&#13;
provinces.&#13;
1.21  Family Planning Status.  These family planning efforts were remarkably&#13;
successful in their early stages. The 1988 Viet Nam Demographic and Health Survey&#13;
(VNDHS) reported a national contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) of 53 percent of&#13;
currently married women of reproductive age, with 95 percent of married women knowing&#13;
of at least one modem family planning method. This total CPR was made up of a CPR for&#13;
modem methods of 38 percent and a CPR for "non-modern", "traditional" or "natural"&#13;
methods (mainly withdrawal and rhythm) of 15 percent. The total fertility rate (TFR) was&#13;
estimated from the same survey and from the 1989 census at just under 4 births per&#13;
woman for the previous year, down from over 6 in the late 1950s and around 5 in 1979.&#13;
Moreover, norms of fertility control and small families appeared to be taking hold;&#13;
according to the VNDHS, the average preferred number of children for young married&#13;
women (those married less than 5 years) was 2.6 and only 35 percent of all women wanted&#13;
any more children.&#13;
1.22  This success was achieved using a remarkably limited and inexpensive approach to&#13;
FP service delivery. Of current acceptors in the 1988 VNDHS, 62 percent were using the&#13;
IUD, amounting to one-third of all currently married women in Viet Nam. Another 29&#13;
percent of contraceptors were using "traditional" or "natural" methods, mainly consisting&#13;
of withdrawal and rhythm. The third most important method was sterilization (mostly&#13;
mini-laps, rarely post-partum) at 6 percent of contraceptors. Only two percent were using&#13;
condoms and less than one percent the pill. Thus the vast majority of FP users were&#13;
relying on methods that either entailed no cost at all or required only very infrequent, or&#13;
once-off, minor surgical procedures with minimal supplies and re-usable equipment.&#13;
Although traditional methods usually have high user failure rates, experience even in&#13;
developed countries such as the USA shows that procedure-based methods are among the&#13;
most cost-effective of contraceptive choices.&#13;
1.23  Moreover, most modern FP services, and hence most of the procedures, have been&#13;
and are provided through lower-level public health facilities. In 1988, almost all family&#13;
planning users had obtained modem methods from the public sector; 45 percent had&#13;
received services at CHCs, 37 percent at district hospitals or intercommunal polyclinics,&#13;
and 12 percent at provincial hospitals. Even by 1993 and 1994, only about 10-11 percent&#13;
of all modem-method FP users had obtained a method privately according to the VLSS&#13;
and ICDS, and the VLSS reported that they were largely users of pills and condoms.&#13;
Given Viet Nam's generously-staffed and extremely dense network of public health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
facilities, and their low current case-loads at the lower levels, the provision of minor&#13;
outpatient procedures such as IUD insertions, mini-laps and vasectomies (nowadays&#13;
mainly done with the minimal no-scalpel technique) would entail minimal incremental costs&#13;
per family planning user.&#13;
1.24  Unfortunately this method mix, however cost-efficient, is far from optimal from&#13;
the standpoint of reproductive and women's health. Heavy use of IUDs is problematic in&#13;
the circumstances of 'Viet Nam for several reasons. The presence of the device may&#13;
promote or exacerbate existing RTIs and the insertion procedure itself carries an&#13;
additional risk of introducing infection unless done with the utmost skill and vigilance.&#13;
These general risks become a cause for serious concem where the incidence of RTIs is&#13;
already high, as in Viet Nam. All but the recently developed progestin-bearing IUDs often&#13;
induce heavy menstrual bleeding, which is undesirable where high percentages of women&#13;
are already anaemic, as in Viet Nam. In addition, the IUD does have a significant, though&#13;
small, failure rate; and armong those pregnancies that occur with the device still in place, a&#13;
high proportion will spontaneously abort at any stage of gestation. This additional burden&#13;
on women's health is particularly undesirable where the abortion rate is already high, as in&#13;
Viet Nam.&#13;
1.25   Heavy use of withdrawal and rhythm is also problematic. Though these methods&#13;
appear to carry little or no health risks in themselves, their failure rate is high among all&#13;
but the most committed and well-supervised users. This in turn is likely to result in high&#13;
rates of abortion. The usefulness of sterilization is limited. It is an essential part of any FP&#13;
program for older couples who decide that they have completed their families, but it is&#13;
inevitably restricted to this category of user and cannot be used for the spacing of births so&#13;
important to matemal and child health. The major gap in the program method mix at&#13;
present is thus the lack of effective, non-invasive, easily reversible methods that can be&#13;
used for birth spacing purposes and by younger couples who have not completed their&#13;
families. Pills and injectables are the most important methods in this category, followed by&#13;
the condom, which also protects against RTIs, and Norplant.&#13;
1.26  Over the years, Viet Nam had thus developed a cost-efficient and initially effective&#13;
family planning prograrn, which however suffered from some important deficiencies.&#13;
Perhaps because of these, the program's progress appears to have slowed in recent years.&#13;
The 1993 Multiround Survey (MIS) reported only an insignificant further rise in the total&#13;
CPR to 54 percent, with a small rise in the modem methods CPR to 41 percent and a&#13;
small decline in the non-modern methods CPR to 13 percent. Corresponding values for the&#13;
much smaller-sample 1992-93 VLSS were a somewhat higher total CPR of 57 percent,&#13;
which however included much multiple use of traditional methods with modern methods.&#13;
The 1994 Intercensal Demographic Survey (ICDS) reported a sharp rise in the total CPR&#13;
to 65 percent, but the C]PR for modern methods increased only marginally to 44 percent,&#13;
while the CPR for non-rnodern methods jumped to 21 percent. Thus overall, the use of&#13;
modern methods of contraception appears to have risen by only six points between 1988&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
and 1994, from 38 percent to 44 percent, with an equivalent increase occurring in the use&#13;
of non-modern methods from 15 percent to 21 percent.&#13;
1.27  The pattern oif FP method mix did not evolve significantly in any desirable&#13;
direction during the six years between 1998 and 1994. The 1992-93 VLSS showed much&#13;
the same method mix as in 1988, except for slightly increased pill and condom use and&#13;
some multiple use of traditional methods in combination with them. The 1993 MRS also&#13;
reported a broadly similar mix, though the range of methods had widened. Use of the IUD&#13;
had risen a little to 65 percent of contraceptors; the share of sterilization had remained&#13;
constant at 6 percent; use of pills and condoms had risen to around 3 percent each;&#13;
another fraction of a percent were using injectables, Norplant or diaphragms; and the share&#13;
of traditional methods had fallen a little to 21 percent.&#13;
1.28  The 1994 ICDS did report some changes, but these cannot be viewed as positive&#13;
overall. Similar percentages of contraceptors as in 1993 were using sterilization (6&#13;
percent) and the pill i(3 percent) and injectables and diaphragms/jelly (a fraction of a&#13;
percent in total); condoms had doubled their share to 6 percent; the percent using IUD had&#13;
dropped to 51 percent, but this was due largely to the much increased percentage relying&#13;
on rhythm and withdrawal (32 percent combined). The proportion of married women&#13;
using the IUD barely changed across all surveys from 1988 to 1994, remaining always&#13;
between 33 and 35 percent. Thus family planning in Vietnam remains heavily focused on&#13;
quick and simple minor surgical procedures with important health drawbacks, and a&#13;
substantial and growing fraction of users continue to resort to no-cost but ineffective&#13;
traditional practices.&#13;
1.29  During these same six years from 1988 to 1994, fertility fell more than might have&#13;
been expected from the above trends in contraceptive use and mix, but still less than&#13;
would have been desirable. The TFR reported for the previous year declined from just&#13;
under 4 in the 1988 VNDHS to 3.5. according to the 1993 MRS and to 3.3 according to&#13;
the 1992-3 VLSS. The 1994 ICDS reported an average TFR for the years 1989-1993 of&#13;
3.3 and a value of 3.1 for 1993 itself It is suspected that at least part of this decline was&#13;
due to the use of pregnancy termination services, since overall the method mix has&#13;
changed to favor the less effective non-modern methods whose failures appear to provide&#13;
an important fraction of termination requests (see para. 1.32). However even a TFR of 3.1&#13;
is still much above replacement level, which at Viet Nam's very low level of mortality&#13;
would be a TFR of under 2.2 births per woman.&#13;
1.30  Pregnancy termination plays a considerable role in the regulation of fertility in Viet&#13;
Nam. The term "pregnancy termination" comprises two separately defined procedures in&#13;
the country. More than half of all termination procedures performed in the country today&#13;
are recorded as "menstrual regulation" (MR); these safer and less traumatic procedures are&#13;
performed within a couple of weeks of a missed period, often without a pregnancy test,&#13;
and require only a special syringe and no dilatation of the cervix. Only later procedures,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
using standard abortion techniques, are recorded as "abortions" in Viet Nam. Both types&#13;
of procedure are legal and available from public health facilities, as well as from the&#13;
private sector. Neither type is considered as a family planning method, but only as a back-&#13;
up in case of contraceptive failure.&#13;
1.31   Taking both types of pregnancy termination together and classifying both as&#13;
abortions, over a million abortions are now performed annually in Viet Nam according to&#13;
service statistics. This amounts to about two abortions for every five births. The&#13;
corresponding total abortion rate (TAR), an analogous measure to the TFR, has been&#13;
estimated from these figures at 2.5 abortions per woman over her reproductive lifetime.&#13;
This would be the third highest level of abortion recorded in the world, surpassed only by&#13;
Romania and the former Soviet Union where contraceptives have been notoriously&#13;
difficult to obtain. Such a high level is unexpected in a country which (unlike Romania and&#13;
the former Soviet Union) has been actively promoting and providing family planning for&#13;
many years, and has achieved a total CPR of 65 percent.&#13;
1.32  Further data on abortion come from the 1988 VDHS and the 1994 ICDS, in which&#13;
women were asked if they had ever had an MR or abortion. However these data must be&#13;
treated with caution, since severe underreporting is almost always expected in direct&#13;
questioning of women on their abortion experience, and seems to have occurred even in&#13;
the relatively unthreatening circumstances of Viet Nam. In 1988, 7 percent of ever married&#13;
women reported having had a termination, with a roughly fifty-fifty split between the two&#13;
procedures. In 1994, this percentage had risen to 13 percent, with these women reporting&#13;
an average of 1.25 procedures. Nearly 60 percent claimed to have been using&#13;
contraception at the time of conception; of those women reporting a recent termination&#13;
(since 1991) following a method failure, nearly 60 percent had been using withdrawal or&#13;
rhythm. Given that only 20-30 percent of contracepting women were users of these two&#13;
methods, it appears that the failure rate of these methods is an important contributor to the&#13;
need for pregnancy termination.&#13;
1.33   According to the 1988 VDHS, 74 percent of all terminations in public facilities&#13;
took place at district hospitals or polyclinics, another 18 percent at provincial hospitals,&#13;
and four percent each at CHCs and central hospitals. Generally speaking, MRs tend to be&#13;
performed at the lower levels of the health system while women would be progressively&#13;
referred up for terminations at later stages. In many ways, therefore, the patterns of use of&#13;
termination procedures match those for the standard FP outpatient procedures of IUD&#13;
insertion and sterilization.&#13;
1.34  The overall picture therefore is of a family planning program whose performance is&#13;
faltering because it is no longer adapted to its clients' needs. The small family norm is&#13;
becoming ever more entrenched in Viet Nam, the proportion of all women wanting any&#13;
more children declined from 35 percent in 1988 to 28 percent in 1994, while the average&#13;
family size preferred by young married women fell from 2.6 in 1988 to 2.3 -- or close to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
replacement -- in 1994. The total CPR has risen to the very high level of 65 percent of&#13;
married women, indicating that couples are translating these desires for small families into&#13;
action. Yet the use of modern methods has stagnated in recent years, while use of&#13;
traditional methods is growing fast. Despite the heavy promotion of the IUD in the public&#13;
program and the general lack of alternatives in the public sector, it has proved impossible&#13;
to raise the level of use above a plateau of one third of married women. Similar though&#13;
less intense promotion of sterilization has failed to raise the level of use above a plateau of&#13;
6 percent of couples. Where couples have had access through the private sector to the pill&#13;
-- and even the not-then-licensed injectables -- use of these methods rises. Levels of&#13;
pregnancy termination are extremely high. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that couples&#13;
are resorting to traditional methods and (partly as a result of their use) to termination&#13;
because they lack a suitable choice of temporary and reversible modern methods. While&#13;
such a combination may reduce fertility, it cannot be considered a desirable or sustainable&#13;
approach to family planning from the viewpoint of family health and welfare.&#13;
1.35  Financing of Family Planning. Funding for population and family planning&#13;
activities in Viet Nam is made up of a mix of domestic and donor funding. In the past, the&#13;
share of donor financing was as much as 30 to 40 percent, but this has now fallen to&#13;
around 20 percent. Much of the contribution of donors has been in kind, such as&#13;
contraceptive commodities, equipment and technical assistance; UNFPA alone has&#13;
provided US$2-3 million worth of contraceptives per year in recent years. Total donor&#13;
support for 1994 is estimated at about US$5.6 million.&#13;
1.36  Domestic population/FP funding largely flows through the national budget of the&#13;
NCPFP, which in 1994 reached about 228 billion dongs or US$20.7 million. Local&#13;
governments at provincial and district level, and commune authorities, are also expected&#13;
to contribute funds to their respective PCPFPs, DCPFPs and CPFPBs; in 1994, provincial&#13;
budget funding for population/FP amounted to 23 billion dongs, or around one-tenth of&#13;
central funding, though funding at lower levels is difficult to track. Altogether, total&#13;
government spending on population and family planning may have amounted to somewhat&#13;
over 251 billion dongs or nearly US$23 million. Thus annual domestic public expenditure&#13;
per capita for the five to six million current family planning users would come to about&#13;
US$3.50 - 4.50. Donor support would add in another US$1 or so, making total public&#13;
spending about US$4.50 - 5.50. According to the VLSS, private spending might amount&#13;
to an additional total US$3 million, or another US 50 cents per user, yielding a grand total&#13;
of public plus private annual spending on family planning of US$5-6 per FP user. These&#13;
are extremely low levels of spending compared with a typical annual FP program cost of&#13;
US$10-20 per user in the developing world, and no doubt reflect the extremely cost-&#13;
efficient FP method mix developed in Viet Nam.&#13;
1.37  A substantial fraction of domestic population/FP funding is transferred through the&#13;
NCPFP and its subsidiary committee network to the health system, to finance the delivery&#13;
of FP services. In 1994, a formal system of "responsibility contracts" was established,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
whereby the PCPFPs, DCPFPs and CPFPBs enter into annual contracts with health&#13;
service authorities at the corresponding level. Funds flow down from NCPFP to each&#13;
subsidiary CPFP level and are then released out to health authorities. The contracts specify&#13;
targets to be achieved by the service providers and the budget that will be provided to&#13;
reach the given targets. Targets are specified in terms of basic numbers, such as numbers&#13;
of acceptors for a given method or of different types of procedures to be performed&#13;
annually. Corresponding budgets are calculated on the basis of a standard unit cost per&#13;
procedure etc., and appear to cover only the incremental costs to the health system of&#13;
providing these FP services. Achievement of targets is monitored regularly, often monthly,&#13;
and it appears that the quarterly release of funds to health authorities for each quarter is&#13;
adjusted according to their actual previous performance.&#13;
1.38  Other items funded through the NCPFP and the subsidiary CPFP network include&#13;
incentives for adoption of a method (paid to both acceptors and the collaborators who&#13;
motivate them), allowances for collaborators, training and management costs of the CPFP&#13;
system, equipment and contraceptive commodities, in-service FP training of health&#13;
workers, and the costs of conventional IEC activities. Only about 7 percent of these funds&#13;
are spent at the central level, with the rest being disbursed through the lower levels of the&#13;
system. In addition, just under one quarter of the NCPFP budget goes to administrative&#13;
costs of the entire CPFP system plus infrastructure costs.&#13;
B. CURRENT ISSUES AND NEEDS IN THE SECTOR&#13;
Family Health&#13;
1.39  The health sector in Viet Nam today faces many challenges. These are laid out in&#13;
the Staff Appraisal Report for the National Health Support Project (Report No. 14971-&#13;
VN), which is designed to support Government in meeting and overcoming them. For&#13;
family health, however, the major and overriding issue is the need to revitalize the state&#13;
primary health care system, defined according to WDR principles as the commune and&#13;
district-level network of facilities. It is at these levels that many of the most cost-effective&#13;
public health and clinical services are delivered, such as short-course chemotherapy for&#13;
tuberculosis, treatment of diarrhea, malaria, and respiratory infections, and immunisations.&#13;
These basic functions, which are almost all of a preventive or palliative nature, are not in&#13;
general provided in a technically satisfactory and cost-effective manner by the private&#13;
sector. According to what survey data exist, Viet Nam's developing private sector, which&#13;
is still largely centred on curative care, self-medication and pharmacies, is not so far&#13;
playing an important role in this type of basic health care. The private sector does appear&#13;
to be substituting for public provision of some curative care, but even this is largely in the&#13;
form of self-medication with purchased drugs, and therefore of unknown and dubious&#13;
quality. Thus, though the private sector will have an increasingly important role to play in&#13;
Viet Nam's health sector, there will in the foreseeable future be no practical alternative to&#13;
the public PHC system for the maintenance and further improvement of basic and cost-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
effective primary health programs such as maternal care, family planning and&#13;
immunization, as well as a safety net of minor curative care for the very poor. There is&#13;
therefore an urgent need to restore operating conditions and staff morale at these grass-&#13;
roots facilities to normal working order, through upgrading of physical premises, supplies,&#13;
staff salaries and staff skills.&#13;
1.40   Adequate primary health services are not needed only to maintain Viet Nam's&#13;
current low levels of mortality and to improve health among all sections of the community&#13;
in a cost-effective manner. They are also essential to the effective delivery of family&#13;
planning. As described above, over 80 percent of users of modern methods had obtained&#13;
services at either commune or district level in 1988, and this pattern does not appear to&#13;
have changed significantly by 1994. In addition, experience worldwide has demonstrated&#13;
that in the long run, family planning is most acceptable and most effectively practiced&#13;
when FP services are well embedded in a health care system which delivers trustworthy&#13;
maternal and child health (MCH) care. Such integration of family planning into family&#13;
health care, which was recently strongly and unanimously endorsed at the Cairo&#13;
International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994, has been a&#13;
principle of Viet Nam's family planning program from the beginning. It urgently needs&#13;
reinforcement now that the country's formerly successful PHC system has come under&#13;
pressure.&#13;
1.41   Within the family health care sector, there are also some key issues and needs&#13;
regarding particular health conditions and service delivery constraints. Some aspects of&#13;
maternal and infant health care require special attention and improvement, notably specific&#13;
antenatal interventions such as anaemia prophylaxis and treatment and tetanus toxoid&#13;
(TT) vaccination and better facilities for first-level referral of complicated deliveries.&#13;
CDD and ARI programs for children have still a long way to go in terms of both&#13;
coverage and effectiveness. Child nutrition interventions through health services, including&#13;
growth monitoring and the promotion of optimum birth spacing and breastfeeding&#13;
practices, are relatively underdeveloped at the primary level. Regarding other aspects of&#13;
reproductive health, the high incidence of both RTIs and abortion is acknowledged to be&#13;
a serious issue for women's health, though far too little is known about the underlying&#13;
causes of either.&#13;
1.42   Outstanding service delivery issues relate mainly to quality, outreach and areas&#13;
where normal patterns of service delivery are inadequate. Quality problems are due&#13;
mainly to the severe decline in financial support for the PHC system, which has resulted in&#13;
low staff attendance and morale, and in lack of adequate regular refresher training to keep&#13;
skills up to date and maintain interest; the consequent declines in facility utilization have&#13;
set up a vicious circle whereby skills are further eroded through lack of practice and staff&#13;
morale and involvement in their work sink even lower. Improved inputs and resources are&#13;
needed to break this cycle. Another aspect of quality concerns the current organization of&#13;
primary health service delivery, which is excessively fragmented and verticalized by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
specific intervention, so that mothers must visit several different facilities or providers to&#13;
obtain a complete package of maternal or child care, or even a full range of contraceptive&#13;
services. The design of primary health care delivery needs to be adjusted to make the&#13;
convenience and needs of the client the central principle.&#13;
1.43  Health outreach problems also originate from changes in commune organization&#13;
and health financing patterns. The old system of village health workers, usually primary&#13;
nurses, broke down with the collapse of the cooperative system, but has not been replaced&#13;
by any equivalent network because of the pressures on public health expenditure. The lack&#13;
of health outreach is all the more felt since the CHC system itself has been deteriorating at&#13;
the same time.&#13;
1.44  There is also a serious and well-established national deficit of one important&#13;
grassroots health worker, namely the secondary midwife who is a key member of the CHC&#13;
establishment. Over sixty percent of CHCs are now estimated to be without a secondary&#13;
midwife (see Annex 1). The prospects for remedying this deficit in the short and medium&#13;
term are dim, and therefore strategies for supplying the lack need to be identified and tried&#13;
out.&#13;
1.45   All these deficiencies in service delivery have particularly severe consequences in&#13;
those areas of Viet Nam where coverage and access to services is inherently difficult&#13;
because of remoteness or scattered and sparse patterns of population settlement; these are&#13;
mostly mountainous regions where Viet Nam's disadvantaged ethnic minority groups are&#13;
concentrated (see paras. 4.18-4.26). New and innovative approaches to service delivery&#13;
need to be tried in such areas.&#13;
Population and Family Planning&#13;
1.46  Viet Nam's family planning program must, for the foreseeable future, continue to&#13;
be mainly state-financed and managed, given the embryonic state of development of the&#13;
private FP sector and the highly cost-effective broad societal benefits to be derived from&#13;
effective fertility regulation across all groups in society. It has enjoyed a very successful&#13;
and cost-efficient first phase, using an approach which was based on low-cost minor&#13;
surgical procedures delivered at low-level health facilities, and backed by an extensive&#13;
campaign of social mobilization to promote small families and to recruit and maintain&#13;
uptake of family planning services. However this approach was never optimal from the&#13;
health standpoint and seems now to be reaching its natural limits, with growth in&#13;
prevalence of modern contraceptive methods stagnating in recent years. Yet fertility is still&#13;
much above the replacement level required to balance Viet Nam's very favorable mortality&#13;
and to reduce population growth to the minimum needed for successful national&#13;
development. There is also a particular need to increase the availability of modern and&#13;
effective temporary methods among younger women and for birth spacing purposes,&#13;
aspects of family planning which are very important for reproductive and child health but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
which have to date been underemphasized in the Viet Nam program. The high incidence of&#13;
pregnancy termination, moreover, is a very strong indicator of unsatisfied demand and&#13;
need for appropriate and effective contraception, and in itself is potentially very damaging&#13;
to women's health. For all these reasons, the major overriding issue in population and&#13;
family planning is the urgent need to develop a new and broader approach to family&#13;
planning which will be suitable for a maturing program like Viet Nam's, which will&#13;
stimulate faster progress in contraceptive use and fertility reduction, and which will better&#13;
promote reproductive health. Though not as cost-efficient as the current procedure-based&#13;
program, this approach represents the only way of achieving the country's broad&#13;
demographic and health objectives. Costs can still be held down by the continued use of&#13;
Viet Nam's PHC system at the lower levels to deliver the bulk of these broader-based&#13;
services.&#13;
1.47  Government is keenly aware of these problems and issues, and has formulated a set&#13;
of policies and strategies aimed at developing a broader approach to family planning in&#13;
Viet Nam. These are set out in the Aide-Memoire presented to the Cairo ICPD conference&#13;
in September 1994 by the Government of Viet Nam. The major principles of the family&#13;
planning program are:&#13;
(a)   a reaffirmation of Government's position that population and family&#13;
planning are an important part of the national development strategy&#13;
and a prominent factor in socio-economic development, playing a&#13;
fundamental role in raising the quality of life for all; hence approval of the&#13;
integration of population and development, with population placed in the&#13;
context of poverty alleviation, building of an equitable, civilized and happy&#13;
society, and ensuring of sustained and sustainable economic growth and&#13;
development;&#13;
(b)   adherence to the principle of voluntary participation in family planning,&#13;
based on full information, combined with responsibility of each couple&#13;
and individual for the numbers, spacing and timing of their children;&#13;
(c)   recognition of the right of every person to reproductive health care;&#13;
(d)   advocacy of the integration of family planning with maternal and child&#13;
health care in order to reduce maternal and childhood mortality;&#13;
(e)   recognition of the role of abortion as not a method of family planning in&#13;
itself, but rather a response to women's right to choice and to safe&#13;
abortion; and&#13;
(f)   recognition of the need to reduce the incidence of abortion to a&#13;
minimum through a strengthened family planning program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
1.48   Strategies to implement these policy principles overlap considerably. They share a&#13;
common approach to family planning as a broad-based program which seeks to satisfy&#13;
client demand and ensure health benefits through provision of a wide range of&#13;
contraceptive methods, good-quality clinical services, extensive IEC and counseling, and&#13;
constant concern for family health. The strategies that focus on family planning itself&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   efforts to diversify and increase the choice of contraceptive methods&#13;
available to couples, so that they have more options among modern and&#13;
effective short-term, reversible and spacing methods; this would include&#13;
intensive promotion of oral contraceptives (both the combined formula for&#13;
general use and the progestin-only formula for breastfeeding mothers),&#13;
condoms, injectables, Norplant, and the latest designs of IUDs,&#13;
(b)   expansion of IEC programs and materials to inform couples through a&#13;
variety of media about the advantages of small families and optimum birth&#13;
spacing and timing, and about the contraceptive choices open to them,&#13;
besides correcting mistaken beliefs and fears about particular methods;&#13;
(c)   refresher training for health providers, in order to bring their knowledge of&#13;
all contraceptive methods fully up to date and to correct mistaken beliefs&#13;
about particular methods;&#13;
(d)   better training in counseling for health providers to ensure that they&#13;
promote appropriate use of all available methods and give correct&#13;
information on the advantages and disadvantages of each method;&#13;
(e)   improved remuneration, training and working conditions for collaborators&#13;
and motivators, coupled with a gradual phasing-out of incentives;&#13;
(f)   improved systems of supervision and monitoring to ensure that providers,&#13;
motivators and collaborators are performing well and observing the major&#13;
policy principles set out above; and&#13;
(g)   improved access to family planning services for groups that are currently&#13;
underserved, such as the populations of many remote and isolated areas.&#13;
1.49  These strategies will also work in general to improve reproductive care and the&#13;
integration of family planning with maternal and child care, as well as to reduce abortion.&#13;
Additional priority areas for the improvement of reproductive health care overlap with&#13;
the PHC needs outlined in paras. 1.39-1.45 above; they include:&#13;
(a)   safe delivery facilities for normal deliveries at commune level or, in isolated&#13;
areas, the best possible care within the community;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
(b)   safe care and emergency transport for complicated deliveries at district&#13;
level;&#13;
(c)   care of anaemia in pregnancy;&#13;
(d)   high-quality services for IUD insertion and pregnancy terminations, to&#13;
prevent post-procedure infections; and&#13;
(e)   adequate treatment of common RTIs at the commune and district level.&#13;
1.50  Special additional strategies to improve the integration of family planning with&#13;
maternal and child health care again overlap with PHC needs as outlined in paras. 1.39-&#13;
1.45; they include:&#13;
(a)   adjustment of health service organization at commune and district level to&#13;
ensure that integrated MCH/FP packages of care are available to clients;&#13;
(b)   widening of the role of collaborators to include promotion of maternal and&#13;
child health in addition to family planning; and&#13;
(c)   refresher training for health providers that will emphasize integration of&#13;
MCH and family planning.&#13;
1.51   Special additional strategies to reduce abortion include:&#13;
(a)   action to ensure that every woman discontinuing an FP method (except to&#13;
conceive) is provided with another method before leaving the facility or&#13;
provider; and&#13;
(b)   action to improve post-abortion and post-partum counseling and services&#13;
so as to ensure that an FP method is provided immediately after abortion&#13;
and as soon as required after a birth.&#13;
1.52  Many of these policy principles and strategies build on existing policies, guidelines&#13;
and best practices in Viet Nam. The challenge will be to improve and revitalize current&#13;
average performance within a context of limited financial resources and an ailing primary&#13;
health care system.&#13;
C. BANK EXPERIENCE&#13;
Lessons from Previous IDA Experience&#13;
1.53  IDA has experience with only one social sector project in Viet Nam to date,&#13;
namely the Primary Education Project (effective January, 1994). The key lesson that has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
emerged during the early stages of this project's implementation is the need to ensure that&#13;
staff of the implementing agency are fully trained in IDA procedures before project start-&#13;
up, particularly in procurement, and that they receive additional follow-up assistance&#13;
during the initial implementation period. RMV implementation specialists are expected to&#13;
play a key role in this process. Because of the general inexperience of NCPFP with self-&#13;
implemented donor projects, it will be even more important than usual to ensure that initial&#13;
project activities are carefully planned well in advance. Retrospective financing from the&#13;
project will be available to provide any needed extra technical assistance.&#13;
1.54  However the NCPFP has benefited in these respects from the use of a PHRD&#13;
Grant for the preparation of the project; this was executed by IDA but with RMV handling&#13;
all local expenditures. The NCPFP Project Unit used PHRD funds to: conduct an&#13;
extensive facilities survey, covering both infrastructure and utilization, in five project&#13;
provinces; hold project planning meetings at provincial, district and commune level;&#13;
conduct a management review of the NCPFP, including a brainstorming workshop for&#13;
NCPFP department directors on strategic planning issues; procure local consultants for&#13;
preparation of specific components; procure a vehicle, computers and other office&#13;
equipment for the PU; and finance some of the PU's operating costs. In the process, PU&#13;
staff acquired invaluable familiarity with IDA procurement, contracting and reporting&#13;
procedures. Initially progress was slow, but with due assistance from RMV and&#13;
international consultants, the PU staff quickly became effective partners in execution.&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.55  IDA's goals in Viet Nam, as laid out in the November, 1995 Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS), are to promote broad-based economic development and to combat&#13;
poverty. IDA's strategy in Vietnam largely reflects Government's own broad strategy for&#13;
development (see para. 1 .5). It is made up of five elements: strengthening of&#13;
macroeconomic management; support to the transition to a market economy; a leading&#13;
donor role in infrastructure development; assistance to development and implementation&#13;
of a poverty-alleviation strategy; assistance to development and implementation of a&#13;
strategy for sustainable use of natural resources. This IDA strategy is to be pursued&#13;
through a combination of adjustment lending, investment projects, economic and sector&#13;
work, and technical assistance.&#13;
1.56  A key element in the strategy for poverty alleviation is to assist in the provision of&#13;
basic social services to poor households, in the belief that sustainable social service&#13;
delivery systems should be developed as the basis for human capital accumulation and&#13;
national social protection. The Population and Family Health project is seen in the CAS as&#13;
contributing to the poverty-alleviation strategy through: a) its development of sustainable&#13;
family health and family planning systems; b) its targeting of specific components to&#13;
particularly vulnerable groups; and c) its assistance towards resolving the urgent problem&#13;
of rapid population growth. In addition, it complements the Primary Education Project,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
another key contribution to the poverty alleviation strategy; on the one hand educated&#13;
girls are more likely to reduce their fertility but require good-quality FP services in order&#13;
to do so, and on the other hand reductions in fertility and population growth will enable&#13;
future investment in education to focus more rewardingly on quality improvements rather&#13;
than just expanding coverage to meet the needs of ever-increasing cohorts of children. The&#13;
National Health Support Project is seen as a third key contributor to the poverty-&#13;
alleviation strategy. Both the Population and Family Health project and the National&#13;
Health Support Project also respond directly to the findings of IDA's "Poverty Assessment&#13;
and Strategy Report"; in particular to the finding that insufficient resources are going to&#13;
finance highly cost-effective public health and clinical services.&#13;
1.57  In addition to its impact on poverty alleviation, the Population and Family Health&#13;
project will also contribute to the strategy for sustainable use of natural resources. The&#13;
rapid growth of population in Viet Nam has put severe pressure on agricultural and forest&#13;
land. Conservation and long-term sustainable use of these resources will not be possible&#13;
without the reduction of population growth to a minimum, which in turn will require the&#13;
reduction of fertility to replacement level.&#13;
Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
1.58  IDA has for some years been engaged in a dialogue with Government on major&#13;
issues in the population, health and nutrition sectors. This dialogue began in 1992 with the&#13;
preparation of the "Viet Nam Population, Health and Nutrition Sector Review" and was&#13;
sustained through the work carried out for the "Viet Nam Poverty Assessment and&#13;
Strategy Report" (1995) and the preparation of the National Health Support Project and a&#13;
nutrition project. Building on the advantage of this comprehensive sectoral context, the&#13;
proposed project would provide an opportunity to focus on the specific needs of the&#13;
population/family planning sector.&#13;
1.59  The project would support the new approach to population and family planning&#13;
programs in Viet Nam which is outlined in Government's position paper presented at the&#13;
Cairo conference. This approach, which seeks to strengthen the integration of family&#13;
planning into the MCH and reproductive health context and to broaden the FP method&#13;
mix substantially, requires investment on a massive scale and with in-depth technical inputs&#13;
across the sector. The established donors in the field, notably UNFPA, UNICEF and GTZ,&#13;
have made invaluable contributions to the FP program to date. However, IDA is in the&#13;
unique position of being able to supply or mobilize both financial and technical resources&#13;
on the requisite scale and with the requisite scope.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT&#13;
Overall Purpose And Scope Of The Project&#13;
2.1    As described in Chapter I, Government has identified current issues and needs in&#13;
the family health and family planning sectors and has formulated strategies to strengthen&#13;
and revitalize current primary health and FP programs. The overall purpose of the&#13;
Population and Family Health project is to support this strengthening and revitalization,&#13;
thereby improving the health status of the population and bringing about a further&#13;
reduction in fertility and population growth. Table 2.1 lays out a matrix relating specific&#13;
project activities to the policy principles and strategies discussed in Chapter 1.&#13;
2.2   The project will operate at two levels, the first national and the second in a&#13;
selected group of 15 provinces. At national level, the focus will be on overall nation-wide&#13;
strengthening of the family planning program, with attention also to related family health&#13;
interventions. For the selected 15 provinces, the focus will be on strengthening of the&#13;
PHC system at commune and district levels, with a particular emphasis on MCH and&#13;
family planning services. Similar support to another group of 15 provinces is being&#13;
provided through Component I of the contemporaneous National Health Support Project.&#13;
The two sets of provinces to be covered include all those with the highest levels of&#13;
poverty and FP/MCH needs which are not already covered by other donor projects (see&#13;
Annex 3). Thus overall, more than half of Viet Nam's total 53 provinces, including most of&#13;
the neediest, would receive support to upgrade their grass-roots health care system under&#13;
the two projects combined. It is expected also that Government would undertake similar&#13;
strengthening in the remaining less needy provinces if experience in the two projects&#13;
provides a successful model.&#13;
Broad Project Goals&#13;
2.3   The Population and Family Health project is intended to support two major policy&#13;
aims of Government. The first policy aim is to achieve the demographic objectives of the&#13;
population and family planning program. These are, for the year 2000:&#13;
a national population growth rate of 1.7 percent per annum&#13;
a population size of no more than 82 million&#13;
Originally, objectives of a national TFR of 2.9 or lower, and a national CPR (all methods)&#13;
of 63 percent had also been set. Since these have been met, new objectives are in place&#13;
(see para. 2.7 below).&#13;

The project will primarily address this aim through the national components focused on&#13;
family planning, but investment in selected provincial PHC systems would be expected to&#13;
improve family planning performance still further in the covered provinces. It and the&#13;
matching National Health Support Project investment should also have an added impact at&#13;
national level, as a model and stimulus for similar investment in the rest of the country.&#13;
2.4   The second major policy aim of Government is to improve the health of mothers&#13;
and children in line with Government's current objectives for the year 2000 of:&#13;
a national IMR of 30&#13;
a national IMMR of 70&#13;
The project's contribution to realization of this aim would be expected to apply primarily&#13;
to the 15 provinces selected for upgrading of primary health care. However some national&#13;
impact would again occur through their role as a national model, plus the beneficial effect&#13;
of the broader-based approach to family planning to be implemented through the project's&#13;
national components.&#13;
2.5   Based on these major Government policy aims, the project's objectives are:&#13;
(a)   to increase utilization of family planning and related family health services;&#13;
(b)   to improve the quality and range of family planning and related family&#13;
health services;&#13;
(c)   to enhance NCPFP's management, planning and policy formulation&#13;
capabilities; and&#13;
(d)   to expand the knowledge base on which policy and technical guidelines&#13;
would be founded.&#13;
The first two objectives will be addressed through both the national and the provincial-&#13;
level components. The third and fourth will be addressed entirely at the national level.&#13;
Specific Project Objectives and Indicators&#13;
2.6    Within this broad framework of project objectives, a matrix of specific objectives&#13;
and indicators at both national and provincial level has been established for the purposes of&#13;
project monitoring and impact evaluation. Indicators cover project inputs, activities,&#13;
specific outcomes and broad impact, with specification of how each indicator would be&#13;
measured. The matrix is shown in full in Annex 4 and has been integrated into project&#13;
reporting formats and management and supervisory arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
2.7   Within this matrix, ten key indicators have been selected to measure project impact&#13;
and achievement under the project objectives (a), (b), and (c) in para. 2.5. They are&#13;
related to corresponding key specific project objectives, which are linked to the policy&#13;
principles, strategies and specific project activities laid out in Table 2.1, as well as&#13;
Government's own objectives for the year 2000 as given above. Achievement of objectives&#13;
(d) will be necessary in order to reach objectives (a) through (c) and hence is indirectly&#13;
measured at the same time. All key indicators and specific objectives relate to broad&#13;
outcomes or impact of the project, and all pertain to the year of completion of the project.&#13;
They are as follows:&#13;
Demographic and Health Outcome&#13;
(1)   A national decline in the TFR to below 2.5 by 2002.&#13;
(2)   A national increase in the CPR for modern methods to 56 percent by 2002.&#13;
(3)   A national reduction of 30 percent in the TAR by 2002.&#13;
(4)   A national decline in the IMR to 25 by 2002.&#13;
Service Performance and Quality&#13;
(5)   A national increase in the share of temporary/short-term and supply-based&#13;
methods (pills, condoms, injectables) to 25 percent by 2002&#13;
(6)   A national improvement in access to an adequate range of family planning&#13;
services by 2002.&#13;
(7)   An improvement in utilization of CHC facilities for pre-natal care in the&#13;
project provinces by 2002.&#13;
(8)   An improvement in the met need for life-saving obstetric care in the project&#13;
provinces by 2002.&#13;
(9)   An increase in the percent of infants who are fully immunized in the project&#13;
provinces.&#13;
(10)  A national improvement in the management information score (see Annex 4&#13;
for description of the score).&#13;
Current base measures for indicators 6-10 are not available, and hence specific objectives&#13;
cannot yet be set. The baseline survey or baseline studies will provide these measures, and&#13;
corresponding objectives will then be set for 2002 through consultation between MOH,&#13;
NCPFP and (where appropriate) local authorities in the project provinces and elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
During negotiations, Government provided assurances that the key indicators and&#13;
objectives listed in para. 2.6-2.7 and the matrix of indicators shown in Annex 4 will&#13;
be used to measure, monitor and evaluate implementation progress and project&#13;
impact [para. 6.1 (c)]. Government also provided assurances that baseline surveys&#13;
and studies substantially in accordance with the outline given in Annex 14 will be&#13;
carried out, and their results used to complete the list of key project objectives as&#13;
described in para. 2.7, by June 30, 1997 [para. 6.1 (d)].&#13;
2.8   The project will be implemented over a period of seven years, from 1996 to 2002.&#13;
B. STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE PROJECT&#13;
2.9   The project is composed of five components, of which four are national in scope&#13;
and focused on family planning and the fifth covers the primary health care system&#13;
(commune and district-level) in 15 selected provinces. These components consist of:&#13;
(a)   Provincial Service Delivery.  Strengthening of PHC services in 15&#13;
provinces, with a focus on family health and family planning services;&#13;
(b)   IEC. Strengthening of family planning and family health IEC programs&#13;
and activities;&#13;
(c)   Contraceptive Supplies. Support for the much-increased supplies of&#13;
contraceptive commodities required for increases in prevalence of modern&#13;
methods and use of temporary and birth spacing methods;&#13;
(d)   FP Management and Institutional Development. Strengthening of the&#13;
management and planning capabilities of NCPFP and its subsidiary&#13;
committee network; and&#13;
(e)   Service Delivery Model Initiatives. Provision of a fund for studies and&#13;
pilots of improved service delivery approaches and interventions in key&#13;
areas of family planning and related family health issues.&#13;
Component 1: Provincial Service Delivery:&#13;
(US$74.8 M equivalent estimated total project cost)&#13;
2.10  This component will strengthen the primary health care system in 15 selected&#13;
provinces of Viet Nam. These provinces consist of Lam Dong, Dong Thap, Bac Thai, Hai&#13;
Hung, Thua Thien Hue, Lao Cai, Nam Ha, Hai Phong, Dac Lac, Tuyen Quang, Lai Chau,&#13;
Vinh Long, Thanh Hoa, Tra Vinh and Kien Giang (see Map 1). They were selected&#13;
according to criteria based on relatively low health and FP status, adequate management&#13;
capacity, no substantial FP donor presence, and regional spread (see Annex 3). These&#13;
criteria also resulted, by and large, in the selection of the country's poorer provinces. Nine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
out of the 15 project provinces have significant proportions (between 15 and 80 percent)&#13;
of disadvantaged ethnic minorities among their population (see para. 4.18).&#13;
2.11   On the basis of a standard package of selected services to be provided by the&#13;
upgraded facilities, three standard packages of inputs have been developed for upgrading&#13;
of CHCs, DHCs and provincial MCH/FP centres in the 15 selected provinces (see Annex&#13;
5); intercommunal polyclinics would be classified on the basis of size and functions as&#13;
equivalent to either a CHC or a DHC and would receive the corresponding package. The&#13;
National Health Support Project is supplying exactly the same standard package to 2819&#13;
CHCs in the 15 provinces covered under its Service Delivery Component; its district-level&#13;
package for 155 DHCs is similar but not identical, covering fewer specialized higher-level&#13;
FP services and more specialized higher-level health services.&#13;
2.12  The inputs supplied under each package include: civil works to the extent&#13;
necessary to provide the basic package of services, covering mainly building renovation&#13;
and/or extension, plus some re-building where required (US$24.9 million); supplies of&#13;
additional furniture, vehicles and equipment to bring each facility up to a complete&#13;
specified standard (US$20.3 million); annual additional supplies of essential drugs and&#13;
medical supplies to bring each facility up to a complete standard list (US$16.1 million);&#13;
and refresher training for all commune and district-level health staff, including training of&#13;
trainers at national and provincial level (US$4.5 million). Facility upgrading would be&#13;
provided to 440 health posts, about half of all CHCs in the project provinces (amounting&#13;
to 1,616 CHCs), and all 184 district-level and 15 provincial-level facilities. During&#13;
negotiations, Government provided assurances that the selection of CHCs to receive&#13;
physical facility upgrading will be carried out according to criteria agreed with IDA&#13;
and substantially in accordance with those laid out in Annex 5 [para. 6.1 (h)l. The&#13;
project will finance costs of civil works; their maintenance during the life of the project;&#13;
incremental furniture, vehicles, equipment and essential drugs and medical supplies;&#13;
development of standard training curricula; training of trainers; and refresher training&#13;
courses for all commune and district-level staff, During negotiations, Government&#13;
provided assurances that all CHCs, DHCs and MCH/FP centers in the 15 project&#13;
provinces will be appropriately staffed and all CHCs will be provided with adequate&#13;
funding to pay staff salaries [para. 6.1 (g)]. Government also provided assurances&#13;
that it would furnish IDA by September 30, 1996, and have an exchange of views&#13;
with IDA on, a comprehensive description of the policy and implementation&#13;
guidelines it will employ to ensure the effective implementation of: (i) cost recovery&#13;
with respect to the essential drugs to be provided by the project in those communes&#13;
of project provinces where applicable; and (ii) provision of essential drugs and&#13;
supplies free of charge in mountainous and remote communes in project provinces.&#13;
The policy and implementation guidelines would be reviewed by the Government&#13;
and IDA each year thereafter and would be an explicit focus of the mid-term review&#13;
[para. 6.1 (r)].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
2.13   Three additional key aspects of this upgrading package are the long term&#13;
maintenance of the upgraded buildings and equipment, the adequacy of the logistics&#13;
system to be used for storing and distributing essential drugs, as well as contraceptives&#13;
(see para. 2.14), and the expansion of outreach systems. Maintenance costs during&#13;
implementation will be supported by the project out of Government's contribution (see&#13;
paras. 3.6-3.7) through a corresponding annual budget for maintenance of project&#13;
buildings, once upgraded. During negotiations, Government provided assurances that&#13;
all CHCs, DHCs and MCH/FP centers physical facilities upgraded under the project&#13;
will be adequately maintained during project implementation according to the&#13;
guidelines specified in Annex 5 Ipara. 6.1 (i)l.&#13;
2.14  To assure adequate storage and distribution of essential drugs and contraceptives,&#13;
an efficient and cost-effective national logistics system is to be developed (see Annex 8).&#13;
It would be based on contracting out of all logistics services, except storage at the central&#13;
and provincial levels, to specialized Government agencies or the private sector. The costs&#13;
of contracting out would be covered by a 7.5 percent service charge on all commodities&#13;
handled. This system would be introduced initially for the essential drugs and&#13;
contraceptives procured under the project and then expanded to cover all health and&#13;
family planning supplies.&#13;
2.15  To strengthen PHC service delivery still further, two model outreach systems are&#13;
to be tested under Component 5 during the first half of the project period (see para. 2.25).&#13;
If evaluated as successful, they would be extended to cover the 15 project provinces under&#13;
this component (US$9.0 million). The first model is a network of village-level health posts&#13;
in remote mountainous areas and the second a strengthened hamlet-based collaborator&#13;
network. The project will finance construction, equipment and essential drug supplies for&#13;
the health posts, and equipment, retraining and allowances for the collaborators. During&#13;
negotiations, Government provided assurances that in the event that the pilot test of&#13;
a strengthened community-based outreach system for family planning and family&#13;
health described in Annex 11 is evaluated as successful, an action plan for its&#13;
implementation will be submitted to IDA for approval and then will be implemented&#13;
as approved in the project provinces [para. 6.1 (1)].&#13;
2.16  Civil works for all facilities except health posts would be phased over the first&#13;
three years of the project, with the provinces of Lam Dong, Dong Thap, Bac Thai, Hai&#13;
Hung, and Thua Thien Hue covered in the first year of the project and the remaining ten&#13;
provinces covered in the second and third years. Provision of furniture, vehicles,&#13;
equipment and essential drugs and medical supplies would commence from the second&#13;
year of the project, with furniture and equipment phased in where necessary according to&#13;
completion of civil works. Curricula development and training of central and provincial&#13;
trainers would be carried out in the first year; refresher training courses would begin in the&#13;
second year and would be phased to correspond with completion of civil works and&#13;
delivery of furniture and equipment where necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Component 2: IEC&#13;
(US$16.8 M equivalent estimated total project cost)&#13;
2.17  This component will strengthen and expand IEC channels, programs and activities&#13;
for family planning and family health programs, in order to deliver a set of key messages&#13;
which are based on the IEC strategy already developed by NCPFP's IEC Department (see&#13;
Annex 6) and tailored to the new approach to family planning outlined above. These&#13;
messages will cover: the use of family planning to delay, space and limit childbearing&#13;
through appropriate modern methods; the prevention and treatment of RTIs; aspects of&#13;
pre-natal and emergency obstetric care; and population issues such as the small family&#13;
norm and gender bias. As an additional strategy, a social marketing initiative for the pill&#13;
will be launched.&#13;
2.18  The IEC  program  will focus both on strengthening of the interpersonal&#13;
communication channels that have been historically so important in the Viet Narr. FP&#13;
program and on making full use of the ever-increasing influence of mass and print media.&#13;
Its major elements would include: equipping all collaborators with IEC bags and (in&#13;
remote mountainous areas) bicycles; strengthening the interpersonal communication and&#13;
counseling skills of health providers; providing an ample supply of simple reference and&#13;
instructional print materials for all health providers and collaborators; and designing and&#13;
implementing a full range of IEC programs and activities through mass media, local&#13;
campaigns and folk media. All collaborators would also be trained in interpersonal&#13;
communication and counseling, but this would be financed out of the NCPFP regular&#13;
budget. The social marketing initiative for the pill would focus primarily on urban areas,&#13;
which contain about 20 percent of Viet Nam's population. It would include: a community-&#13;
based door-to-door promotion and home-resupply program for poor urban&#13;
neighborhoods; a standard social marketing program for pharmacies in better-off&#13;
neighborhoods; and a national mass media campaign to promote the pill which would&#13;
cover both urban and rural populations.&#13;
2.19  The project will finance costs of: IEC materials development, production and air or&#13;
screen time; training of IEC trainers; IEC training courses for health providers and IEC&#13;
staff, transport and equipment for collaborators; IEC special campaigns, workshops,&#13;
events etc.; and social marketing program costs other than pills themselves, which will be&#13;
supplied under Component 3.&#13;
Component 3: Contraceptive Supplies:&#13;
(US$25.3 M equivalent estimated total project costs)&#13;
2.20  This component will finance the purchase of the bulk of contraceptive commodities&#13;
required for an increased modern-method CPR and broadened method mix over the four&#13;
years 1997-2000. Condoms are excluded because they have never been supplied through&#13;
donor financing. Government has always supplied them directly to the program through&#13;
the regular NCPFP budget and will continue to do so for the future. Table 2.2 shows the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
desired changes in the method mix to be achieved over the life of the project, and Annex 7&#13;
gives details of the projections of contraceptive use and costs on which this component is&#13;
based. Broadly speaking, overall contraceptive prevalence would rise from a current&#13;
estimated CPR for modem methods of 44 percent to 56 percent in 2002. The percent of&#13;
users relying on permanent or semi-permanent methods (IUDs, sterilization, Norplant)&#13;
would change only a little from 58 percent to 60 percent. However the 10 percent now&#13;
using temporary methods which require large volumes of supplies (pills, condoms,&#13;
injectables) would rise to 25 percent by 2002, while conversely the 30 percent currently&#13;
using "natural" methods (mainly rhythm and withdrawal) would fall to 15 percent. Within&#13;
categories, the use of new, improved types of IUDs and progestin-only pills would rise.&#13;
2.21   At present, the total national bill for contraceptive commodities of about US$2.5 -&#13;
3 million (excluding condoms) is met largely by UNFPA. The project will finance all such&#13;
costs as calculated above (excluding condoms) for the four years 1997-2000, including the&#13;
7.5 percent logistics charge. For the years 2001 and 2002, it is assumed that Government,&#13;
with or without the assistance of donors, would meet the bulk of commodity costs.&#13;
However the project will provide a small reserve fund for those years in case of&#13;
unexpected needs.&#13;

Component 4: FP Management and Institutional Development&#13;
(US$6.7 M equivalent estimated total project cost)&#13;
2.22   This component will strengthen management, planning and policy formulation&#13;
capabilities in NCPFP and its subsidiary network of CPFPs, including upgrading of&#13;
management skills and improvements in reporting systems. For the upgrading of&#13;
management skills, a series of workshops would be held as a follow up to the management&#13;
review undertaken during project preparation (see para. 1.54). The workshops will&#13;
identify organizational needs in the light of strategic planning priorities for the NCPFP and&#13;
its subsidiaries, and plan the corresponding skill and training needs. Appropriate curricula&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
will then be developed and training of trainers carried out. Actual training will be funded&#13;
under the NCPFP regular budget.&#13;
2.23 For the improvement of the FP program management information systems (MIS),&#13;
an overall strategy has been developed (see Annex 9), according to which the MIS would&#13;
support strategic planning activities at national and provincial levels, operational activities&#13;
at commune level, and a coordinating function at district level. The MIS would be fully&#13;
computerized at national and provincial level, but not below for the present. The project&#13;
will support costs of computers and associated software; other MIS and office equipment;&#13;
planning workshops; development of management and MIS training curricula; training of&#13;
management and MIS trainers; and MIS training courses for selected NCPFP, PCPFP,&#13;
DCPFP and CPFPB staff. The component will also cover the costs of the project&#13;
management structure and of monitoring and evaluation activities.&#13;
Component 5: Service Delivery Model Initiatives&#13;
(US$6.0 M equivalent estimated total project cost)&#13;
2.24  This component will provide a basis for policy and strategy review and adjustment&#13;
in the areas of family planning and family health service delivery. It will provide funds for&#13;
development of models and pilot testing of new or innovative approaches and models for&#13;
service delivery, with supporting studies, wherever there are issues, gaps or needs in&#13;
existing systems. Proposals for topics will be developed, reviewed, and financed if&#13;
acceptable, over the period of project implementation as needs arise. Arrangements for the&#13;
administration of component funds are given in Annex 10. During negotiations,&#13;
Government provided assurances that detailed proposals for all activities to be&#13;
financed under the service delivery model initiatives component will be submitted,&#13;
through a Service Delivery Model Initiatives Committee to be established by August&#13;
31, 1996 and described in Annex 10, to IDA for prior review and approval, and&#13;
thereafter will be implemented as approved by IDA [para. 6.1 (k)l.&#13;
2.25  An initial indicative list of topics has been developed, and is given in detail in&#13;
Annex 11. It includes:&#13;
(a)   testing of a model for a strengthened collaborator system (including the&#13;
renaming of the collaborators as Family Health Workers), with smaller&#13;
numbers, larger allowances, full-time working hours and tasks expanded to&#13;
encompass the promotion of family health, in selected communes of the&#13;
fifteen project provinces; the cost of expanding the new model to provide&#13;
entire coverage of the project provinces (equivalent to about one-third of&#13;
the country's population) would be supported under Component I (see&#13;
para. 2.15), if the model is evaluated as successful;&#13;
(b)   testing of a model outreach system to supplement CHC primary health care&#13;
services in remote mountainous areas (where most disadvantaged ethnic&#13;
minority populations live), involving establishment of village-based health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
posts staffed from the CHC and providing FP/family health promotion and&#13;
minor curative services; the model would be tested in remote mountainous&#13;
areas of the fifteen project provinces and then extended to cover all such&#13;
areas in the provinces under Component I (see para. 2.15) if evaluated as&#13;
successful;&#13;
(c)   studies and model testing for ways of mobilizing the private and NGO&#13;
sectors to provide family planning and reproductive health services through&#13;
a variety of approaches, including credit schemes, updated training for&#13;
providers, incentive programs for providers in remote areas (see para.&#13;
4.24), support to establishment of professional associations for private&#13;
providers; supplies of tailormade IEC materials; and a systematic review of&#13;
constraints on private practice followed by action to alleviate them;&#13;
(d)   a pilot test of the acceptability and impact of charging for contraceptives;&#13;
the results would be used to introduce a phased system of charges during&#13;
the second half of the project;&#13;
(e)   studies and testing of improved approaches to safe motherhood services,&#13;
including key aspects of safe pregnancy and delivery such as reduction of&#13;
anaemia and vitamin A deficiency, safe home deliveries, and management&#13;
of high-risk pregnancy and obstetric complications; the emphasis would be&#13;
on understanding the patterns and causes of current problems and on&#13;

(f)   studies and testing of improved approaches or protocols in key problematic&#13;
aspects of family planning and reproductive health, including the very high&#13;
incidence of MR/abortion, the quality and acceptability of IUD services,&#13;
and prevention and treatment of RTIs; the emphasis would be on&#13;
understanding the patterns and causes of current problems and on&#13;
improving current approaches; and&#13;
(g)   testing of model approaches and strategies for improving access to good-&#13;
quality family planning and family health services for disadvantaged ethnic&#13;
minorities, including (beyond the health post model described above)&#13;
special participative baseline and evaluative studies, participative design of&#13;
models and strategies and piloting of selected approaches, such as special&#13;
incentive programs to attract private and NGO providers to minority areas&#13;
and special training programs for traditional midwives.&#13;
During negotiations, Government provided assurances that: (a) a pilot scheme of&#13;
charges for contraceptives will be carried out by June 30, 1999; (b) an action plan&#13;
will be prepared on the basis of its results by August 31, 1999 for review and&#13;

3. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT&#13;
AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
A. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.1   Summary of Project Costs.  The total cost of the project is estimated at&#13;
Vietnamese Dongs 1,426 billion or US$129.6 million equivalent, including contingencies&#13;
and taxes. A summary of costs by project component is given in Table 3.1, and a summary&#13;
by category of expenditure in Table 3.2. Costs by component, category of expenditure and&#13;
year are given in Annex 12.&#13;
3.2   Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency allowance for&#13;
unforeseen physical additions at 3 percent of base cost (US$3.8 million equivalent) and for&#13;
inflation at 14.0 percent of base cost (US$15.5 million equivalent) in accordance with&#13;
Bank-wide and regional guidelines.&#13;
3.3   Taxes and Duties. Project cost estimates for technical assistance and training&#13;
have been calculated net of taxes. Taxes levied internally on local purchasing are estimated&#13;
at about US$4.3 million (3.3 percent of total project cost). Taxes on imported goods and&#13;
consultant services contracts will be fully met by Government from its own resources.&#13;
3.4   Foreign Exchange Costs.  Direct and indirect foreign exchange costs are&#13;
estimated at 53 percent of base project cost. The estimated foreign exchange component&#13;
for the various expenditure categories is as follows: civil works 30 percent; equipment 72&#13;
percent; drugs 95 percent; contraceptive supplies 95 percent; foreign technical assistance&#13;
90 percent; local technical assistance 10 percent; overseas training 95 percent; local&#13;
training 20 percent; service delivery model initiatives 18 percent; maintenance 20 percent;&#13;
operating costs and logistics 10 percent.&#13;
3.5   Incremental Recurrent Costs.  The project investments in provincial PHC&#13;
systems and the national FP program will add no new regular staff in either case; hence&#13;
there will be no incremental salary costs. Incremental supplies of drugs and medical&#13;
supplies and contraceptives provided under the project are viewed as investments. In the&#13;
case of drugs and medical supplies, the aim is to restore public confidence and hence&#13;
former utilization rates for PHC facilities through a major upgrading effort; while in the&#13;
case of contraceptives, the aim is to bring about a major shift in the FP method mix&#13;
towards supply-based methods. Both types of commodity will be fully funded out of the&#13;
IDA credit, ADB concessional loan or KfW grant. They will nonetheless require to be&#13;
sustained after the life of the project; this issue is addressed in paras. 4.30-4.33 and Annex&#13;
16.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
3.6   There are four types of incremental costs generated by the project that will be&#13;
classified as incremental recurrent costs and included as such in the total project cost. The&#13;
first type is maintenance of civil works undertaken under the project (5.6 percent of the&#13;
base cost of civil works) and of equipment purchased under the project (7.5 percent of the&#13;
base cost of equipment), amounting altogether to US$4.2 million (total including&#13;
contingencies) over the project period. Maintenance costs for civil works cover materials&#13;
and labor while those for equipment cover spare parts and labor. The second type is the&#13;
incremental budget for collaborator allowances (6 percent of the total base costs,&#13;
amounting to US$8.7 million including contingencies) required from 1998 onwards, if the&#13;
strengthened collaborator system to be piloted under Component 5 in five project&#13;
provinces is successful, and hence is extended throughout the fifteen project provinces.&#13;
The third type is logistics costs (4 percent of total base costs, amounting to US$5.6&#13;
million including contingencies) for storing and distributing drugs and medical supplies&#13;
and contraceptives. The fourth type is operating costs (1 percent of total base costs,&#13;
amounting to US$1.1 million including contingencies) covering travel, supplies and&#13;
communications expenses for management and training activities needed during the life of&#13;
the project. Maintenance and logistics costs will be funded 100 percent out of the&#13;
Government contribution; for outreach worker allowances and operating costs, 70 percent&#13;
will be funded out of the IDA Credit and 30 percent out of the Government contribution.&#13;
The first three types of incremental costs will require sustaining after the life of the&#13;
project: this issue is addressed in paras 4.30-4.33 and Annex 16.&#13;

B. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.7       The estimated  total project cost of US$129.6 million  equivalent, including  taxes,&#13;
will be financed by:&#13;
(a)    a Government contribution of US$18.6 million equivalent including taxes;&#13;
(b)    an IDA credit of SDR33 .6 million (US$50.0 million equivalent) net of&#13;
taxes;&#13;
(c)    co-financing from an ADB concessional loan of US$41.0 million; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
(d)   co-financing from a KfW grant of DM. 30 million (approximately US$20&#13;
million).&#13;
3.8   The structure of project financing is laid out in Annex 12, and may be summarized&#13;
as follows:&#13;
(a)   the Government contribution of US$18.6 million equivalent (14.4 percent&#13;
of total project cost including taxes) will finance logistics costs,&#13;
maintenance costs, and a portion of the overall costs of civil works,&#13;
outreach workers allowance and operating cost for all components except&#13;
Component 5;&#13;
(b)   the IDA credit will finance 39.9 percent of total project cost net of taxes,&#13;
and would cover: 33.2 percent of the costs of provincial service delivery&#13;
(covering five project provinces) under Component 1; 82.8 percent of the&#13;
costs of Component 2 (IEC); 11.8 percent of the costs of Component 3&#13;
(contraceptive supplies); 92.8 percent of Component 4 (management &amp;&#13;
institutional development); and 33.3 percent of the costs of Component 5&#13;
(service delivery model initiatives);&#13;
(c)   the ADB concessional loan will finance 31.6 percent of total project cost,&#13;
and would cover 49.4 percent of the costs of Component I (covering ten&#13;
project provinces); and 66.7 percent of the costs of Component 5 (covering&#13;
the private/NGO sector development subcomponent); and&#13;
(d)   the KfW grant will finance 15.4 percent of total project cost, and would&#13;
cover 79 percent of Component 3 (covering contraceptive commodities for&#13;
the years 1997-2000, not including logistics costs).&#13;
3.9   The contribution from KfW will be administered as parallel co-financing. Funds are&#13;
available immediately.&#13;
3.10 The contribution from ADB will be administered as parallel co-financing. ADB&#13;
would formulate, negotiate and approve a separate project with Government, covering the&#13;
elements and costs described above. The project is expected to be submitted to the ADB&#13;
Board by end-1996 and to start implementation by the beginning of 1997. ADB's&#13;
contribution to the project has therefore been designed in such a way that no funds for&#13;
activities covered by them will be required before January, 1997.&#13;
3.11  Project Preparation Financing.  Funds from the Japan Policy and Human&#13;
Resource Development (PHRD) Fund to the amount of JPY 62.5 million (approximately&#13;
US$ 640,000 equivalent) were used for project preparation, under execution by IDA. The&#13;
PHRD funds were used for the Project Unit of NCPFP to: conduct an extensive facilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
and infrastructure survey in five project provinces; hold project planning meetings with&#13;
their provincial, district and commune networks; engage international and local&#13;
consultants to assist in technical preparation of specific project components (in the fields&#13;
of IEC, training, MIS, management and ethnic minority research), as well as in the drafting&#13;
of project proposals; make study tours of World Bank-supported population and health&#13;
projects and national family planning programs in neighboring countries; purchase office&#13;
equipment for the PU; and support PU's incremental operating costs.&#13;
3.12  In addition, ADB has provided funds for a Project Preparation Technical&#13;
Assistance (PPTA) package. This package was designed to supplement and extend the&#13;
assistance to preparation given through the PHRD fund. It included similar facilities and&#13;
infrastructure surveys in the remaining ten provinces, a multi-visit international&#13;
consultancy in private/NGO sector development, and repeat visits of international&#13;
consultants to assist the NCPFP in finalizing preparation of the training, MIS and&#13;
management components. PPTA activities began in June, 1995, with repeat consultant&#13;
visits plus the first visit of the private/NGO development specialist, and are scheduled to&#13;
be completed early in 1996.&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.13  Procurement arrangements for the project are summarized in Table 3.3.&#13;
3.14  Civil Works.  Civil works (estimated cost about US$19.7 million, including&#13;
contingencies), will be undertaken following national competitive bidding (NCB)&#13;
procedures satisfactory and acceptable to the Bank. In remote and mountainous areas&#13;
where packaging would not be possible to follow NCB procedures, relatively small civil&#13;
works contracts, each valued at about US$30,000, will be awarded by obtaining at least&#13;
three quotations from local contractors up to an aggregate amount of US$3.9 million.&#13;
Most civil works included in this project would be small and simple, consisting of repair or&#13;
renovations of existing small buildings at CHCs and parts of the DHCs plus some minor&#13;
additions such as extra rooms or minor operating theaters, and would be scattered over&#13;
the provinces being financed under IDA. Owing to the nature and size of these works,&#13;
NCB procedures are appropriate since no foreign contractors are likely to be interested in&#13;
them. However, NCPFP will group these works in suitable packages so as to minimize&#13;
the number of contracts being awarded under this component, with a view to managing&#13;
their execution effectively and efficiently. Further, it would be desirable for NCPFP to use&#13;
suitable postqualification criteria to be included in the bidding documents prior to inviting&#13;
bids, in order to determine the capacity of the individual contractors to undertake more&#13;
than one package while awarding the contracts to them. The contractors may form joint&#13;
ventures with other contractors if they wish to enhance their financial and technical&#13;
resources. These works will be carried out through the Provincial Project Management&#13;
Units (PPMUs) under NCPFP's overall guidance and supervision. NCPFP has drafted&#13;
the required bidding documents following the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for&#13;
&#13;

3.15  Goods.  The project provides for the procurement of materials, equipment,&#13;
vehicles, drugs, and medical supplies.  Inclusive of contingencies, the costs of the&#13;
equipment are estimated to equal about US$16.4 million and of drugs and medical&#13;
supplies equal to about US$14.8 million. These equipment items and drugs would be&#13;
procured following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines, January 1995. In respect of equipment and drugs to be&#13;
procured by ICB, domestic bidders will be eligible for a margin of preference in the bid&#13;
evaluations of 15 percent of the C.I.F. costs of the competing imports or the existing rate&#13;
of customs duty, whichever is less. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods will be&#13;
grouped in bid packages costing at least US$150,000 each. Contraceptives amounting in&#13;
value to US$20.0 million equivalent will be covered under KfW financing arrangements.&#13;
IDA will finance contraceptives to the value of US$3.0 million. Contracts for equipment&#13;
costing less than the equivalent of US$150,000 each, such as surgical equipment, hospital&#13;
beds, delivery beds, delivery tables, diagnostic tables, etc., add up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$8.4 million will be procured through NCB procedures satisfactory and acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. NCB procurement of surgical equipment is recommended because no foreign&#13;
supplier manufactures this type of equipment in the smaller sizes needed to accommodate&#13;
Viet Nam's smaller hand and pelvic sizes. Small-value items, or groups of items costing&#13;
less than US$25,000 per contract subject to an aggregate amount of US$4.9 million, will&#13;
be procured by prudent shopping, requiring quotations from at least three reputed&#13;
suppliers. NCPFP has drafted the bidding documents following (a) the Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents for Procurement of Goods, January 1995 for the procurement of&#13;
goods and   (b) the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of&#13;
Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines, September 1993 as amended to reflect therein the changes&#13;
as per the Bank's Guidelines, January 1995 for the procurement of drugs and&#13;
pharmaceuticals.&#13;
3.16  Training, Technical Assistance, Studies &amp;  Pilots, Outreach  Workers&#13;
Allowance and Operating Costs. IDA will finance all or part of the costs (inclusive of&#13;
contingencies) of the training (US$5.8 million), technical assistance (US$5.1 million),&#13;
operating costs (US$1.1 million), studies &amp; pilots (US$8.0 million) and outreach workers&#13;
allowance (US$8.7 million) components, to the extent of US$19.9 million as against the&#13;
aggregate of US$28.7 million provided for these components in the project. However, the&#13;
maintenance of civil works and equipment (US$4.2 million) and logistics (US$5.6 million)&#13;
charges included in the project will be entirely financed by the Government of Viet Nam.&#13;
The training component includes the retraining of health workers in job-related knowledge&#13;
and skills, IEC counseling etc. and will be carried out by the provincial secondary medical&#13;
schools or national institutions. NCPFP will award these assignments, with the exception&#13;
of the technical assistance component, to its own agencies in the provinces on a sole&#13;
source basis and enter into "responsibility contracts" with them to carry out these&#13;
assignments. However, before entrusting these assignments, NCPFP will provide to IDA&#13;
essential details as necessary about them, including copies of the draft "responsibility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
contracts" for its review, to ensure that they comply with the Bank's Guidelines. The&#13;
project supports the employment of consultants to undertake technical assistance&#13;
assignments. These consultants will be selected and appointed in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank&#13;
as Executing Agency. NCPFP will prepare a draft letter of invitation and the contract&#13;
following the Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consulting Services, June 1995.&#13;
3.17  Contract Reviews. All civil works contracts in excess of US$150,000 (including&#13;
the first two civil works contracts regardless of their respective estimated cost), all goods&#13;
contracts in excess of US$150,000 and all consulting contracts in excess of US$100,000&#13;
for firms (US$50,000 for individuals) will be subject to prior review by the Bank. With&#13;
respect to all consulting contracts, irrespective of value, prior review will be required for:&#13;
(a) terms of reference; (b) single source contracts regardless of value; (c) all consultant&#13;
contracts and assignments of a critical nature (such as environmental safety or public&#13;
health considerations) regardless of value; and (d) contract amendments valued at more&#13;
than US$100,000 for firms (US$50,000 for individuals), or those that raise the total&#13;
contract value to more than US$100,000 for firms (US$50,000 for individuals). This will&#13;
allow prior review for approximately 80 percent of the procurement process under the&#13;
project. NCPFP would use the Bank's latest Standard Bidding Documents as follows: (a)&#13;
Procurement of Works (Smaller Contractors), January 1995 and as adapted to Vietnam's&#13;
local requirements to carry out NCB procurement; (b) Procurement of Goods, January&#13;
1995 for materials and equipment; (c) Procurement of Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines,&#13;
September 1993 as amended to reflect the changes as per the Bank's Guidelines of&#13;
January 1995; and (d) Standard Form of Contract for Consulting Services, June 1995.&#13;
NCPFP has already drafted and submitted all documents to the Bank, for use under this&#13;
project.&#13;
3.18   Table 3.4 provides schedules for the preparation of bidding documents for civil&#13;
works, goods and consulting services, procurement actions, construction and selection of&#13;
consultants under the project components. Project activities are expected to commence&#13;
early in 1996 and conclude in 2002.&#13;
D. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.19  The proposed IDA credit of US$50.0 million equivalent will be disbursed over a&#13;
period of seven and a half years, with disbursements to be completed by the closing date&#13;
of June 30, 2003. The proposed disbursement schedule is shown in Table 3.5 and Figure&#13;
1. Little accumulated experience is available for Viet Nam, so the profile for the East Asia&#13;
&amp; Pacific Region is shown as a standard. The proposed schedule has relatively high levels&#13;
of early disbursements because of concentrated early procurement of the equipment,&#13;
supplies and civil works necessary for facility and FP program upgrading. It is considered&#13;
feasible since draft bidding documents are already finalized and RMV staff will provide&#13;
support to the staff of the NCPFP PMU and the provincial PMUs in handling procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.20   Disbursements from  the IDA credit will be made for eligible project expenditures&#13;
in accordance with provisions made in the Development Credit Agreement. Retroactive&#13;
financing will be allowed for expenditures incurred prior to the date of signing of the&#13;
Development Credit Agreement but after June 30, 1995, in an amount not exceeding&#13;
US$2.0 million. Disbursements will be made against: (a) 90 percent of the total&#13;
expenditures for civil works; (b) 100 percent C.I.F for foreign expenditures, 100 percent&#13;
ex-factory local expenditures for locally manufactured goods, and 85 percent of local&#13;
expenditures for off-the-shelf items; (c) 100 percent of total expenditures for training,&#13;
technical assistance and studies &amp; pilots; (d) 70 percent of expenditures of outreach&#13;
workers allowance; and (e) 70 percent of incremental operating costs. As a condition of&#13;
disbursement for allowances for outreach workers under the strengthened&#13;
collaborator system, an action plan, satisfactory to IDA, for implementing the&#13;

an authorized allocation equivalent to US$2.0 million, based on four month's average&#13;
expected expenditures, will be established in a bank acceptable to IDA. The first&#13;
withdrawal will be limited to an amount equivalent to US$800,000 until the aggregate&#13;
amount of withdrawals from the Credit Account plus the total amount of all outstanding&#13;
special commitments entered into by IDA shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of&#13;
US$16 million. The PMU in NCPFP would manage and operate the Special Account. All&#13;
documentation relating to the Special Account will be kept in the PMIU and made available&#13;
for review by IDA. Applications for replenishment of the Account, supported by&#13;
appropriate documentation, will be submitted monthly or when the account is drawn by 20&#13;
percent of the Authorized Allocation, whichever occurs first. For withdrawal outside the&#13;
Special Account (applications for direct payment or for issuance of Special Commitments)&#13;
a minimum application value of 20 percent of the Authorized Allocations will be observed.&#13;

4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.1   The proposed project will be implemented by the NCPFP and the local&#13;
governments of the project provinces.  An organogram of the project management&#13;
arrangements is shown in Annex 13. During negotiations, Government provided&#13;
assurances that the project management structure as laid out in Annex 13 will be&#13;
established, staffed and maintained throughout the project implementation period&#13;
Ipara. 6.1 (m)l. As a condition of effectiveness, Government will provide evidence&#13;
satisfactory to IDA that: (a) the Project Steering Committee, the Project Executive&#13;
Committee and the NCPFP Project Management Unit have been established and&#13;
the Project Director appointed; and (b) the Provincial Project Management Units in&#13;
the five provinces included in the first phase of Component I have been established&#13;
and the corresponding Provincial Project Managers appointed (para. 6.2).&#13;
4.2    A ministerial-level Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be established to&#13;
provide overall direction and guidance to the project. It will be chaired by the Chairman,&#13;
NCPFP, and will include high-level representation from MOH, the MPI, SBV and the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The Committee will meet as often as required, and not less than once&#13;
every three months.&#13;
4.3   The technical implementation of individual components will be assigned to the&#13;
corresponding existing Departments of NCPFP. The Directors of these Departments will&#13;
form the members of an Executive Committee (EC), which will be established under the&#13;
PSC and will also be chaired by the Chairman, NCPFP. The EC will meet every two&#13;
months. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be established to coordinate and&#13;
administer the day-to-day implementation of the project, including the handling of all&#13;
procurement and disbursement. Its Director will be seconded from within NCPFP, and will&#13;
take the rank of Department Director. Its Deputy-Director will be seconded from MOH.&#13;
The PMU will act as secretariat to the EC. The 16 staff of the PMU will include both staff&#13;
seconded from within NCPFP and hired contractual staff as needed to provide particular&#13;
technical expertise.&#13;
4.4   At provincial level, a Provincial Project Management Unit (PPMU) will be set up&#13;
in each of the 15 project provinces. The PPMUs will coordinate day-to-day&#13;
implementation of project activities in their provinces, including the management of civil&#13;
works (see Annex 5). Each PPMU will be composed of four staff, who will be seconded&#13;
from within the PCPFP or hired as contractual staff, as needed. The mandate of the&#13;
PPMIJs will include close coordination with the corresponding provincial health bureaus.&#13;
During negotiations, Government provided assurances that all necessary steps will&#13;
be taken to ensure that each of the project provinces implements its activities under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
the project and is provided, promptly as needed, the funds, facilities, services and&#13;
other resources required for that purpose [para. 6.1 (n)l.&#13;
4.5   Coordination between NCPFP and MOH is critical for the success of the project,&#13;
given that the actual delivery of family planning and family health services is the&#13;
responsibility of MOFH.  Several mechanisms are in place to ensure the necessary&#13;
collaboration:&#13;
*  the NCPFP is structured such that one of the Vice-Chairpersons is also the Vice-&#13;
Minister of Health.  Such high level representation reinforces the importance&#13;
placed by the two ministries on coordination.&#13;
*  the Project Steering Committee, which will provide advice and guidance on policy&#13;
and major project issues, will have a representative from MOH and&#13;
*  the key position of Vice-Director of the PMU will be filled by an MOH official,&#13;
who will facilitate coordination in the day-to-day execution of the project.&#13;
In addition, throughout the preparation of both the Population and Family Health Project&#13;
and the National Health Support Project (to be implemented by MOH) several&#13;
collaborative activities took place as follows:&#13;
o Population and Family Health project planning meetings which were held at the&#13;
national, provincial and district levels included participants from both ministries;&#13;
- a number of joint meetings were held with representation from NCPFP, MOH and&#13;
World Bank missions.&#13;
The design of the matching provincial service delivery components of the two projects&#13;
reflects this collaborative process.   Close cooperation between the two Project&#13;
Management Units is expected to continue during implementation.&#13;
B. PROJECT ACCOUNTS AND AUDITING&#13;
4.6   The total project accounts will be maintained by the PMU in NCPFP. Separate&#13;
accounts for appropriate project components and activities will also be maintained by the&#13;
local government of each project province. All will be kept in accordance with sound&#13;
accounting practices. The project accounts will reflect all financial transactions during the&#13;
project implementation period for both IDA credit and counterpart funding in two books,&#13;
one by project components and the other by expenditure categories. The project account&#13;
will be separated from all routine budget accounts and other foreign-financed project&#13;
accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
4.7   Project accounts will be audited in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial&#13;
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (The World Bank, March&#13;
1982). During negotiations, Government provided asssurances that audits of&#13;
project-related records and accounts, including the Special Account, will be&#13;
undertaken in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied,&#13;
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and that audited accounts and financial&#13;
statements, in a format agreed with IDA, and including separate audits of&#13;
Statements of Expenditures, will be sent to IDA within nine months of the end of&#13;
each Government fiscal year [para. 6.1 (a)].&#13;
C. PROJECT MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING&#13;
4.8   Project Monitoring and Evaluation. Key project indicators are listed in para.&#13;
2.7, while a full matrix of input, intermediate and impact indicators for the project is given&#13;
in Annex 4, together with a note of how they would be obtained. Overall, most indicators&#13;
of project inputs would be obtained through either the project MIS or the national FP&#13;
program MIS, while most indicators of intermediate and ultimate impact would come from&#13;
special population-based surveys.&#13;
4.9   Three major surveys will be carried out under the project for the purposes of&#13;
project evaluation, namely the baseline survey, the mid-term review survey, and the final&#13;
evaluative survey (see Annex 14). The baseline survey will be a population-based sample&#13;
survey, carried out at the beginning of the project. It will assess the FP and family health&#13;
status of the population. Information will be gathered on levels, trends and patterns of:&#13;
fertility; FP knowledge, attitudes and use; childhood morbidity and mortality; reproductive&#13;
health; childbearing and childfeeding practices; and access to and use of major PHC&#13;
services such as maternal care, immunization and micronutrient supplementation. The&#13;
questionnaire and the plan of tabulation and analysis will be structured around the matrix&#13;
of project indicators, with particular emphasis on the ten key indicators.&#13;
4.10  The baseline survey will be scaled to yield significant results for both the country&#13;
as a whole and appropriate groupings of provinces; in addition, the 15 project provinces&#13;
will be oversampled to, provide key measures of PHC service access and utilization for&#13;
individual provinces. As an addendum to the baseline survey, similar smaller surveys will&#13;
be conducted among the most numerous ethnic minority groups. These will include&#13;
qualitative focus-group studies to elicit more in-depth information on attitudes,&#13;
preferences and key health and FP issues in a consultative and participative framework.&#13;
4.11  The results of 1he mid-term review survey will form one of the inputs into the&#13;
Mid-Term Review (see paras. 4.15-4.17), and fieldwork and analysis would be scheduled&#13;
accordingly. The survey will consist of a repeat of the baseline survey, but with the&#13;
questionnaire limited to a few core topics. These would be chosen either to monitor&#13;
background trends in key indicators or to assess project impact in those areas where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
significant progress could be expected by the project midpoint. Again, results would be&#13;
disaggregated to national, provincial grouping, individual project province and individual&#13;
major ethnic group levels. Fieldwork and analysis would be designed to yield quick and&#13;
robust results, rather than an in-depth exploration of the data.&#13;
4.12  The final evaluative survey will be carried out just before project completion. It&#13;
will be a full repeat of the baseline survey. A comprehensive in-depth analysis of its results&#13;
will be produced, making full use of the data from the two earlier surveys for comparison.&#13;
This analysis would assess trends in health and FP status and services over the life of the&#13;
project and the contribution of the project to them. The fieldwork and analysis would be&#13;
scheduled to allow the results to be used in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR).&#13;
The survey report and the ICR will be fully reviewed and discussed by Government, IDA&#13;
and project co-financiers at a Project Completion workshop.  During negotiations,&#13;
Government provided assurances that an Implementation Completion Report,&#13;
based in part on the results of the final evaluative surveys and studies, will be&#13;
provided and discussed with IDA within six months after the closing date of the&#13;
project [para. 6.1 (p)].&#13;
4.13  In addition to these three major surveys, smaller special surveys would be carried&#13;
out as required, in such areas as IEC or training assessments. Some of these are described&#13;
in Annexes 5, 6, 11 and 14.&#13;
4.14 The NCPFP PMU will be responsible for the management of all monitoring and&#13;
evaluative activities under the project. Surveys and special studies would be contracted&#13;
out as required to other Government agencies with special expertise in the necessary&#13;
fields, such as the General Statistical Office (GSO) and the Centre for Population and&#13;
Human Resource Studies in MOLISA.&#13;
4.15  Project Reporting. The PMU will provide six-monthly project progress reports&#13;
to IDA and co-financiers according to the format given in Annex 14. This format is based&#13;
on the matrix of project indicators shown in Annex 4. The focus would normally be on&#13;
routine project monitoring and hence on input indicators from the project MIS. Results of&#13;
major or smaller surveys would be summarized in these progress reports, but also written&#13;
up in full separate reports. In addition, the PMU will produce a report on the results of the&#13;
Mid-Term Review and an Implementation Completion Report. During negotiations,&#13;
Government provided assurances that six-monthly project progress reports will be&#13;
submitted to IDA by June 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning December&#13;
1996, substantially in accordance with the format laid out in Annex 14 (para. 6.1&#13;
(b)). Government also provided assurances that an annual review of the project&#13;
work program and budget for the next fiscal year will be provided to IDA for review&#13;
and comments by August 31 of each year, beginning 1996, and the work program&#13;
will be subsequently implemented in a manner satisfactory to IDA [para. 6.1 (fl).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
4.16  The Mid-Term Review. At the mid-point of the project (approximately end-&#13;
1999), a Mid-Term Review will be carried out by the PMU according to the outline given&#13;
in Annex 14. The purpose of this Review would be to assess overall progress in the&#13;
project up to its mid-point, and hence the prospects for meeting the original objectives of&#13;
the project in full, on time, and within the original budgetary envelope of the project. IDA&#13;
and the project co-financiers will then review the findings of the Review with Government.&#13;
On that basis, joint decisions will be made on any major changes or restructuring in the&#13;
project that appear necessary.&#13;
4.17  The Mid-Term Review will consist of three parts. For the first part, the PMU&#13;
would conduct a comprehensive internal stocktaking of progress in project&#13;
implementation. This would be based largely upon the project MIS. The second part will&#13;
be an external review, by another Government agency or a selected private consultant, of&#13;
the progress of the project in meeting its objectives. This would be based partly on the&#13;
results of the internal stocktaking and partly on data from the mid-term review survey&#13;
described above. For the third part, the PMI will synthesize the first two parts into an&#13;
overall assessment of project status. This assessment would include recommendations&#13;
for changes, restructuring or remedial action in the remainder of the project. It will be&#13;
embodied in a Mid-Term Review report, which will be submitted to IDA and the project&#13;
co-financers early in the year 2000 for review and discussion at a Mid-Term Review&#13;
workshop. During negotiations, Government provided assurances that a project&#13;
midterm review report substantially in accordance with the outline given in Annex&#13;
14 will be provided to IDA by August 31, 1999 and reviewed with 1DA by December&#13;
31, 1999 [para. 6.1 (e)I.&#13;
D. PROJECT IMPACT ON SOCIAL ISSUES&#13;
Impact on Ethnic Minorities&#13;
4.18  According to the 1989 census, the population of Viet Nam was made up of 87&#13;
percent Kinh (ethnic Vietnamese) and of 13 percent ethnic minorities, who belonged to&#13;
more than 50 different ethnic groups with distinct cultures. These ethnic minorities vary&#13;
enormously in size; the two largest groups, Tay and Thai, have populations of over one&#13;
million each, while some of the smallest are numbered only in the hundreds. They are&#13;
found in all regions and provinces of Viet Nam, ranging from less than one percent to 96&#13;
percent of provincial populations in 1989 (see Annex 15). Subdivision of some provinces&#13;
since 1989 complicates estimation, but roughly speaking, minority groups make up 50-80&#13;
percent of the population in three out of the 15 project provinces, and 15-30 percent in&#13;
another six. A few of the minority groups, such as the Han Chinese, are either fully&#13;
integrated into mainstream Kinh society or enjoy an equal or superior standard of living.&#13;
However most are relatively disadvantaged. They mainly inhabit the mountainous, forested&#13;
and remote parts of the country, often living in small and scattered settlements to which&#13;
access is extremely difficult.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
4.19 Government has implemented several policies and programs aimed at improving&#13;
the standard of living and meeting the special needs of these disadvantaged groups. In the&#13;
family planning area, the national "one or two-child" policy has been modified to suit their&#13;
minority status by allowing three children to couples belonging to mountain-dwelling&#13;
minority groups. In health, special programs have been set up to try to improve the supply&#13;
of health staff for minority communities, including special scholarships for minority girls&#13;
and boys wishing to become doctors, nurses or midwives. However it is acknowledged&#13;
that health and FP services still remain extremely deficient in many minority areas.&#13;
Consistent with the objectives of Operational Directive (OD) 4.20 on the protection of the&#13;
interests of indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities, the project will therefore include&#13;
special strategies to ensure equity in health and FP status between minority groups and&#13;
their Kinh neighbors (see Annex 15).&#13;
4.20   As a preparatory step, two preliminary studies of ethnic minorities were&#13;
undertaken during project preparation. The first was a desk study which collated available&#13;
statistics and general information on ethnic minorities in Viet Nam. The second was a&#13;
participative field study carried out by an anthropologist with long experience in the field&#13;
in Thailand and Viet Nam, including one of the project provinces. It collected original data&#13;
in a second project province through quick field surveys of health and FP status and access&#13;
to services, and also held participative discussions with minority communities on their&#13;
needs and preferences in family planning and family health. In addition, this study&#13;
compiled the scanty information available on these topics for the country as a whole.&#13;
4.21   Available demographic data indicate that all of Viet Nam's minority groups except&#13;
the Han lag behind the Kinh in terms of the demographic transition to low levels of fertility&#13;
and mortality. According to the 1989 census, all the nine most numerous groups excepting&#13;
the Han had TFRs above 4.0, with most above 5.0. By contrast, the Kinh TFR was&#13;
estimated at 3.6 and the Han TFR at only 2.9. Similarly, all nine groups had IMRs higher&#13;
than the estimated Kinh level of 39, except for the Han at 31; the range was from 41 to as&#13;
high as 106, with most minority IMRs well above 50. Available socio-economic data show&#13;
higher levels of poverty and illiteracy lying behind these demographic disadvantages.&#13;
According to the 1993 VLSS, average annual expenditure, a proxy for income, was much&#13;
lower for all minority groups (except the Han) than for the Kinh; typically expenditure was&#13;
more than a third lower and sometimes almost two thirds lower. According to the 1989&#13;
census, literacy levels among the population aged 5 years and over were lower among all&#13;
ethnic minorities, even the Han, than among the Kinh, of whom 87 percent were literate.&#13;
There was however a considerable variation among minority groups; some had literacy&#13;
rates of 80 to 83 percent, while others had rates as low as 10-20 percent.&#13;
4.22  The findings of these two preliminary studies also indicate that among at least&#13;
some ethnic minorities, demand for PHC and modern FP services is quite as high as&#13;
among the Kinh. There may be a greater preference for temporary and short-term&#13;
contraceptive methods over permanent or long-term methods, but few other cultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
features have been found which would require adapting of regular FP and PHC services to&#13;
suit local cultural attitudes and practices. The major disadvantages of these groups appear&#13;
to arise from lack of access to such services, because of the difficult and remote terrain in&#13;
which they tend to live.&#13;
4.23   Special strategies are needed under the project in order to improve access and&#13;
quality of services among ethnic minorities up to the standard of their Kinh neighbors. The&#13;
first requirement is a better data base. Baseline surveys will therefore be carried out early&#13;
in the project among the most numerous ethnic minority groups in Viet Nam. These&#13;
would assess current health and FP status and access to services, relative to neighboring&#13;
Kinh communities. On this basis, a full set of strategies would be designed to remedy any&#13;
disadvantages found. Annex 14 gives an outline of the scope and methodology which will&#13;
be followed for these surveys.&#13;
4.24  It is already clear that the major focus of such strategies overall will be the&#13;
improvement of access to good-quality family health services, with emphasis on extension&#13;
of outreach in remote mountainous areas. As already described in paras. 2.15 and 2.25, a&#13;
new system of village-based health posts would be piloted in these areas under Component&#13;
5 and then expanded to cover all such areas in the 15 project provinces under Component&#13;
1, if successful. In addition, under the accompanying pilot of an upgraded collaborator&#13;
system providing a range of family health services, the new Family Health Workers in&#13;
remote mountainous areas would be furnished with bicycles; additional transport would be&#13;
provided for DHC mobile teams serving remote mountainous and delta areas; and special&#13;
programs of recruitment and training of paramedical staff belonging to ethnic minorities&#13;
would be developed and implemented. Other possible approaches to improving access to&#13;
services might include special efforts to train traditional midwives to supervise home&#13;
deliveries safely, and special incentive programs for private or NGO health practitioners or&#13;
pharmacies willing to settle in or tour remote areas. Baseline studies for the 15 provinces,&#13;
the formulation of appropriate special strategies, and the piloting of selected approaches&#13;
will all be funded under Component 5 (paras. 2.24-2.25); extension of the health post and&#13;
collaborator pilots (if successful), plus DHC mobile team transport and special training&#13;
programs, would be funded under Component I (para. 2.15).&#13;
4.25   At national level, all components focusing on family planning will support a&#13;
widening of the method mix and a new emphasis on temporary and short-term methods.&#13;
Hence preferences for such methods among minority groups should automatically be&#13;
catered for under the project. However, a special national FP strategy for ethnic minorities&#13;
will also be formulated. It will aim to improve access to FP services and adapt IEC&#13;
materials and activities, including training in counseling, as needed (see Annex 15).&#13;
4.26  In order to monitor and evaluate the implementation and impact of these special&#13;
strategies for disadvantaged minorities, special follow-up surveys will be carried out for&#13;
the most numerous minority groups (see Annex 14). During negotiations, Government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
provided assurances that the project will be carried out in accordance with a&#13;
strategy satisfactory to IDA, which will: (a) be designed on the basis of studies and&#13;
surveys undertaken by qualified and experienced experts under terms of reference&#13;
and timing satisfactory to IDA; and (b) include provisions for the informed&#13;
participation of and consultation with a variety of representative communities&#13;
benefiting under the project, in particular communities with ethnic minorities, to&#13;
ensure that the design and implementation of the project adequately addresses the&#13;
needs and cultural preferences of such communities [para. 6.1 (o)].&#13;
Impact on Women&#13;
4.27  The proposed project is intended to support strengthening of primary health care&#13;
and family planning programs in Viet Nam, with a focus on improving maternal, family&#13;
and reproductive health services. As a result, women will benefit from better access to&#13;
higher-quality services offering a wider range of contraceptive methods, improved care in&#13;
pregnancy and delivery, and better treatment of reproductive tract infections. As a result,&#13;
the need to resort to abortion should decline and the number of unwanted or mistimed&#13;
births should be reduced. Women would therefore be able to care for their children and&#13;
families more effectively, as well as to increase their income-generating activities and their&#13;
participation in development. The impact of the project on women is thus expected to be&#13;
very favorable.&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT&#13;
4.28  Impact on the Environment. The project will have no effect on the environment.&#13;
Protocols will be developed for the safe disposal of syringes at all health facilities covered&#13;
under Component I of the project, and their implementation will be monitored as part of&#13;
project supervision.&#13;
4.29  Resettlement Issues. There are no resettlement issues.&#13;
F. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
Financial Sustainability&#13;
4.30  Provincial PHC Services. Component 1 of the project will deliver a package of&#13;
inputs to upgrade PHC service delivery in 15 provinces. The inputs are civil works,&#13;
equipment and furniture, essential drugs and medical supplies and refresher training;&#13;
outreach systems might also be strengthened but this is not certain and hence will not be&#13;
taken into account here. The incremental recurrent cost burden to be sustained after&#13;
project implementation will comprise the maintenance of the upgraded civil works and&#13;
equipment (which would be shared between the health and population/FP budgets), and&#13;
annual drug and medical supplies plus logistics costs. These costs will be met out of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
regular health budget and would amount to approximately US$2.7 million per annum by&#13;
2002, or well under one percent of the projected health budget for 2002 (see Annex 16 for&#13;
details). Incremental costs on this scale should not by themselves be difficult to sustain.&#13;
4.31   The National Health Support Project will provide a similar upgrading package&#13;
over the same period to another 15 provinces, raising total coverage to more than half the&#13;
country's population. However this would still only raise incremental recurrent costs for&#13;
the 30 provinces together to around US$5.4 million or less than 1.5 percent of the national&#13;
health budget. Taking a broader perspective, if the provincial upgrading package should&#13;
succeed in improving service quality and utilization, Government might consider a similar&#13;
upgrading program in the country's remaining provinces. At most, however, the recurrent&#13;
cost burden from a similar investment program in the rest of the country would about&#13;
double that generated by the two projects, to consume altogether no more than 3 percent&#13;
or so of the national health budget. It does not appear, therefore, that the upgrading of&#13;
Viet Nam's PHC services could create any major problem of sustainability.&#13;
4.32   Family Planning Program. Under the project, the contraceptive prevalence rate&#13;
for modern methods is projected to rise by about 10 percentage points. Numbers of users&#13;
will rise proportionately even more, since the population of reproductive age is also&#13;
increasing. At the same time, the contraceptive method mix is projected to broaden and&#13;
become more commodity-intensive. Thus total national costs for contraceptive&#13;
commodities plus logistics costs (excluding condoms) are projected to rise from a current&#13;
level of around US$3 million to around US$7.5 million by 2002. The increase of about&#13;
US$ 4.5 million per year may be viewed as the recurrent cost burden generated overall by&#13;
the project's activities, even though only a minor proportion of these contraceptive costs&#13;
would be financed directly by the project by 2002. This increase plus the population/FP&#13;
budget's share of maintenance costs would be equivalent to about 8.5 percent of the&#13;
projected population/FP budget for 2002, a significant but sustainable increment.&#13;
4.33   Taking a wider perspective, however, the annual total contraceptive bill of US$7.5&#13;
million is the amount that would need to be sustained after the closure of the project,&#13;
equivalent to about 13 percent to the projected total budget for population and family&#13;
planning in 2002 (see Annex 16 for details). This scale of resource allocation for&#13;
contraceptive supplies is not excessive by the standards of family planning programs&#13;
worldwide. It should therefore be sustainable by the Government of Viet Nam even if all&#13;
these supplies were to be financed by Government itself and provided free of charge&#13;
through public programs. In fact, a proportion of users already obtain their contraceptive&#13;
supplies from the private sector and the importance of both the private sector and social&#13;
marketing is likely to grow substantially during the life of the project. A program of&#13;
charges for public program users is also planned to be introduced during the second half of&#13;
the project. It is moreover very likely that donor support to contraceptive supplies would&#13;
continue to be significant after the year 2000, outside the umbrella of the project itself&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
The sustainability of the expanded contraceptive costs should therefore present no major&#13;
problems.&#13;
Institutional Sustainability&#13;
4.34  The project has been designed to avoid any serious problems of institutional&#13;
sustainability after project closure. No permanent salaried staff have been added to either&#13;
provincial health services or the FP program, and no major changes are to be made in their&#13;
organizational structure or their tasks. Though some new approaches are to be tested&#13;
under the project, such as health posts and strengthened outreach systems, they will be&#13;
evaluated thoroughly for viability and sustainability before being expanded. The project&#13;
should result in increased health and FP workloads, due to the planned upgrading of&#13;
facilities, services and IEC, but the network of facilities and staff is currently so dense that&#13;
their capacity to accommodate such increases is expected to be ample. There will be a&#13;
massive temporary increase also in the IEC program, but the incremental activities are&#13;
designed primarily to support the restructuring and upgrading of the FP program under the&#13;
project itself Therefore, the level of IEC activities and expenditure would revert to the&#13;
pre-project norm  after project closure.  Other elements of the project, such as&#13;
management training and MIS upgrading, would improve the efficiency of program&#13;
management and administration.  No major issues of institutional sustainability are&#13;
therefore anticipated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
5. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   There will be a range of overlapping benefits from the project. First, at the&#13;
national level, the proposed strengthening of Viet Nam's family planning program should&#13;
result in improved information, education and communication about family planning,&#13;
better quality of family planning services, and a wider choice of methods for couples&#13;
including those best suited to temporary use and for the purposes of birth spacing. In turn,&#13;
these improvements should lead to greater demand for family planning and to more&#13;
effective and prolonged use of contraception; hence to a reduction in the incidence of&#13;
abortion, improved birth spacing and timing practices, smaller family sizes, lower fertility&#13;
and reduced population growth. An average seven million contracepting couples would&#13;
annually be beneficiaries of this strengthened FP program.&#13;
5.2   The benefits that would flow individually to women, children and famnilies would&#13;
be improvements in maternal, child and reproductive health and in family welfare. The&#13;
additional benefits that would flow to the entire economy and society of Viet Nam,&#13;
comprising more than 80 million people by 2002, would include the reduction of long-&#13;
term pressure on agricultural and forest land, on other natural resources, and on state and&#13;
family budgets for the social services required for the care and education of child&#13;
dependents.&#13;
5.3   Second, for the 15 project provinces where primary health care services would&#13;
also be strengthened under the project, there will be additional benefits related to these&#13;
interventions. As a result of the improvements in working conditions resulting from&#13;
upgraded premises and adequate supplies of equipment and drugs, combined with&#13;
improved knowledge and skills resulting from refresher training, primary health providers&#13;
in these provinces should be enabled and motivated to deliver good-quality primary health&#13;
services to the rural population. These would focus on maternal, child and reproductive&#13;
health care (including family planning) and also provide treatment for major infectious&#13;
diseases and minor ailments combined with screening and referral for more serious&#13;
conditions.&#13;
5.4   This should lead to a number of health benefits to communities in these provinces,&#13;
including reductions in morbidity and mortality from the communicable diseases of&#13;
childhood, diarrheal and respiratory diseases, malaria, TB, reproductive tract infections,&#13;
and conditions related to complications of pregnancy and delivery for mothers and to&#13;
birth for infants. The entire population of the 15 project provinces, amounting currently to&#13;
over 20 million or 28% of the total population of Viet Nam, would benefit from access to&#13;
improved PHC services. Beneficiaries of the core PHC interventions, covering maternal&#13;
and young child care plus FP, would amount to an average 5.4 million annually, made up&#13;
of around 740,000 women requiring maternal care, around 1.7 million children under three&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
years of age and around 3.0 million contraceptors. These benefits should be particularly&#13;
important to the poorest sections of rural communities, since they are the least able to&#13;
purchase adequate replacement services in the private market. In addition, if the package&#13;
of inputs provided by the project in these provinces (and likewise by the National Health&#13;
Support Project in 15 other provinces) is successful in revitalizing their PHC systems, this&#13;
should provide a powerful stimulus and model for similar strengthening in the remaining&#13;
half of the country.  The project's studies and pilots of the private sector (plus&#13;
complementary policy studies under the National Health Support Project) would also lead&#13;
to a better knowledge base for action to regulate and improve private sector services.&#13;
5.5   Without the project (and the accompanying National Health Support Project)&#13;
Government is highly unlikely to be able to mobilize sufficient domestic or external&#13;
funding for major upgrading of the FP program (including social marketing) or of primary&#13;
health care in the provinces. Without such investment, the FP program would probably&#13;
stagnate at its current level of modern method coverage and with its current method-mix.&#13;
Through lack of choice and information, couples would increasingly resort to ineffective&#13;
traditional methods. As a result, fertility decline would be slower and abortion rates&#13;
would remain undesirably high.&#13;
5.6   Without major investment, the PHC system is likely to deteriorate still further to a&#13;
point where even the major preventive programs decline in coverage and effectiveness.&#13;
Since no effective private sector alternatives have developed for these types of health&#13;
interventions, there will be a risk of resurgence of communicable disease epidemics and a&#13;
stagnation or rise in child and maternal death rates. Such trends have already been&#13;
observed in other countries or population groups where PHC systems have deteriorated.&#13;
At the same time, curative care would continue to be dominated by self-medication from&#13;
pharmacies of unknown quality and effectiveness and to a lesser extent by largely&#13;
unregulated private providers. In such conditions, clients are unlikely to obtain the most&#13;
cost-effective medical care for their illnesses, and rates of morbidity and mortality could&#13;
not be minimized.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
5.7   Technically, the packages of family planning and PHC interventions to be delivered&#13;
under the project present little risk. The technologies and techniques for providing&#13;
effective and good-quality FP and PHC programs and services are well-understood and&#13;
well-tested around the world. Viet Nam's experience in both sectors is long and generally&#13;
successful, demonstrating unquestionable ability to implement efficiently and sustained&#13;
commitment to the goals of better health and reduction of fertility and population growth.&#13;
The risks of the project relate more to the rapidly-evolving social and economic context of&#13;
Viet Nam and the ability of the mature FP and PHC programs to change, as well as to the&#13;
country's inexperience with IDA projects and procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
5.8   For the FP program, the major overall risk is that despite high-level NCPFP&#13;
commitment and the fresh inputs and strategic directions supported by the project, the&#13;
expected broadening of the method mix and shift towards a client-oriented approach may&#13;
not be achieved as rapidly as projected. One constraint might be the recognized difficulty&#13;
in changing attitudes and practices among entrenched program managers and health&#13;
providers. It might also prove harder than expected to correct current client&#13;
misconceptions and shift client preferences towards less familiar methods. These risks will&#13;
be minimized within the project by: intensive IEC activities; extensive training in&#13;
appropriate counseling for all providers and motivating staff, management training and&#13;
inputs for the CPFP network to promote fresh attitudes and thinking; and the use of the&#13;
results of studies and pilot interventions financed under the service delivery model&#13;
initiatives to support strategic rethinking and adoption of innovative approaches.&#13;
5.9   For the provincial strengthening of primary health, the major risk is related to&#13;
the project's basic assumption that the utilization rates of public health facilities have fallen&#13;
primarily because of poor service quality arising from resource constraints. It is possible,&#13;
however, that public confidence in the state PHC system may not be retrievable at this&#13;
point even if services are dramatically upgraded. Thus utilization rates might not recover&#13;
despite the project's investments. If the private health provider sector develops sufficiently&#13;
fast and effectively to provide a viable alternative to either the state system or self-&#13;
medication from pharmacies, a further dimension to this risk would be added. However&#13;
experience elsewhere has shown that state PHC systems continue to be attractive,&#13;
particularly to the very poor, if access and quality of services can be assured. The project&#13;
would minimize this risk by providing the complete package of inputs needed to achieve&#13;
the required levels of access and quality.&#13;
5.10  Finally, there is a general risk that project implementation may prove to be slow&#13;
and unsatisfactory, particularly in the area of civil works, because of Viet Nam's&#13;
inexperience with IDA and ADB project procedures, coupled with the limitations of&#13;
NCPFP management capabilities. This risk would be minimized by the management&#13;
training and support to be provided to NCPFP and the subsidiary CPFP network within&#13;
the project, and by a special civil works monitoring unit in the NCPFP PMU. Extensive&#13;
training in IDA and ADB procedures is also planned prior to project implementation. The&#13;
positive experience of NCPFP's use of the project's PHRD fund (see para. 1.54),&#13;
combined with Viet Nam's successful management of PHC and FP programs in the past,&#13;
despite adverse conditions, suggests that this risk is not unduly high.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                       Annex I&#13;
THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN VIET NAM&#13;
Health Services&#13;
1.           Health services in Viet Nam are organized on a four-tiered system. At the&#13;
apex is the Ministry of Health (MOH), and below are the provincial, district and commune&#13;
level health services.&#13;
Central Level&#13;
2.           The MOH is the main national authority in the health sector and directly&#13;
manages faculty schools, national production units of drugs and medical equipment, and&#13;
all centrally-based hospitals (19% of all hospital beds and 7% of all health/medical&#13;
workers). The MOH, at the central level, is responsible for setting policy and technical&#13;
directions for the entire country.&#13;
3.           The MOH is organized into 13 functional departments responsible for&#13;
different activities such as training, family planning, maternal and child health, equipment&#13;
and construction, and finance, planning and policy. The MOH is assisted in its activities by&#13;
a number of central specialty institutes which function as tertiary care referral centers such&#13;
as the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Institute for the Protection of Mothers and&#13;
Newborn, the National Institute of Nutrition, and a number of other institutes responsible&#13;
for research, training and patient care in the areas of pediatrics, tuberculosis, pharmacy&#13;
and traditional medicine. In addition to the MOH, there are a number of ministries which&#13;
provide parallel health services (e.g. Ministry of Defense).&#13;
4.           Over the years, Viet Nam has also developed a number of self-contained&#13;
vertical health programs, including malaria, TB and ARI control, and CDD, with&#13;
structures running from the central to the district level. These structures, though useful in&#13;
focusing attention and resources on important public health programs, are proving&#13;
inefficient in terms of duplication of resource allocation. Given the complex structure and&#13;
overlapping functions at the central level, there is a broad recognition of the need to&#13;
streamline the overall management of health services, as well as coordinate and integrate&#13;
the vertical programs for better cost efficiency.&#13;
Provincial Level&#13;
5.           The next level is the provincial health services which is responsible for the&#13;
center for preventive medicine stations, the local production of medical supplies, and&#13;
referral laboratory facilities. The provinces also run provincial hospitals and in some&#13;
cases, specialized hospitals (30% of all hospital beds). The provincial general hospitals are&#13;
intended to be referral centers and typically have all seven departments (internal medicine,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -                       Annex I&#13;
obstetrics and gynecology, surgery, pediatrics, infectious diseases, traditional medicine and&#13;
emergency ward). Manpower at the provincial level is 35% of the nation's total.&#13;
However, in practice, few of the patients cared for at these hospitals come from outer&#13;
communities and the vast majority reside in the general vicinity of the hospitals. The&#13;
hospitals therefore serve basic curative needs which could be effectively attended to at&#13;
lower levels of the health care delivery system.&#13;
6.           One other important component of the provincial health services are the&#13;
secondary medical schools. These schools train middle level health workers for their&#13;
provinces, such as assistant doctors, secondary midwives, nurses and secondary&#13;
pharmacists.&#13;
District Level&#13;
7.           The third level is the district level which is in charge of all medical facilities&#13;
that are intermediaries between the provincial and commune levels. The three components&#13;
of the district health services are the District Health Office which has surveillance and&#13;
program management responsibilities; the preventive medicine services dealing with EPI,&#13;
CDD, malaria control, vitamin A deficiency etc.; and the District Hospital which provides&#13;
first referral facilities to the commune level. The latter two components are now merged&#13;
into the District Health Centers which deal with both preventive and curative health&#13;
services.&#13;
8.           The district hospitals (18%  of all hospital beds and over 30%  of all&#13;
health/medical staff) have excess bed capacity because, in the past, financial allocations&#13;
were made based mainly on the number of beds they had. As a result, bed occupancy&#13;
rates average only 50%.&#13;
9.           Also, though most district health resources (manpower, finances, drugs,&#13;
equipment etc.) are concentrated in the district hospitals, the support these hospitals&#13;
provide to the lower levels vary in both quality and quantity. There is therefore an urgent&#13;
need to improve the quality of services and focus the range of services provided at this&#13;
level in order to facilitate its functioning as a first referral facility.&#13;
10.          There is also a hybrid facility which overlaps several communes known as&#13;
the inter-commune polyclinic (ICP). The ICPs (5% of all hospital beds) were envisaged as&#13;
centers to provide basic services at a higher level of sophistication (with some specialties&#13;
such as ophthalmology and dentistry), take referrals from CHCs and give supervision and&#13;
other technical services, including training, to CHCs. However, the ICPs do not appear to&#13;
be fulfilling this role, and in practice function as either CHCs or DHCs depending on their&#13;
capacity. The Government is currently initiating discussions on the future role of the&#13;
ICPs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                      Annex I&#13;
Commune Level&#13;
11.         At the commune level, the unit of service delivery is the commune health&#13;
center (CHC). Viet Nam has developed a wide network of commune health centers at the&#13;
grassroots level and CHCs account for 28% of all beds and 22% of health/medical staff in&#13;
the country. 93% of all communes have a CHC and the remaining communes (known as&#13;
'White communes') are to be provided with CHCs over the next three years. However,&#13;
observations indicate that much work needs to be done on the quality of available CHC&#13;
infrastructure. Many of these facilities are run-down and lack the most basic equipment&#13;
and drugs. Also, though in theory the CHCs are to be staffed by 3 to 5 health workers, in&#13;
practice over 60% of them lack even a secondary midwife.&#13;
12.         Each commune consists of a cluster of hamlets or villages, which is the&#13;
basic social unit in the country. Unfortunately, an outreach system (the brigade or&#13;
primary nurse system) which was in existence during the years of the war, has collapsed&#13;
and there is therefore no household level primary health system in Viet Nam.&#13;
Private Health Sector and its role in Primary Health Service Provision&#13;
13.         It is important to note the rising presence of the private sector in the&#13;
provision of health services in Viet Nam. The government has permitted private practice&#13;
since 1988, and this has resulted in the emergence of numerous pharmacies, and to a lesser&#13;
extent clinics, in both urban and semi-urban areas. A major issue facing private practice is&#13;
regulation to (a) ensure that standards of practice are set and enforced and (b) distinguish&#13;
between official and private practice among workers in the public sector.&#13;
14.         About 30% of health workers were forced into retirement due to economic&#13;
difficulties including demilitarization. Most of these retirees have returned to their&#13;
villages, and if well organized could be used to provide community-based health care,&#13;
especially in rural areas. It will however be necessary to establish specific role and&#13;
responsibilities for them in their communities.&#13;

THE FAMILY PLANNING SYSTEM&#13;
1.          The population and family planning program in Viet Nam has a dual&#13;
organizational structure which runs in parallel but is interactive and coordinated at the&#13;
different levels. The service delivery function is lodged in the MOH, Department of&#13;
MCH/FP, and all clinical family planning services are provided through the health system&#13;
(see Annex 1).&#13;
2.          In 1984, as part of an effort to improve the Government's capacity to&#13;
manage and implement the population programs, the Council of Ministers created the&#13;
National Committee for Population and Family Planning (NCPFP). In 1989, the status of&#13;
NCPFP was further elevated to that of the apex body in advising the Government on&#13;
policy formulation and program development. It is also responsible for intersectoral&#13;
coordination in the implementation of family planning programs of various ministries,&#13;
agencies, levels of government and mass organizations. The Minister of Population and&#13;
Family Planning acts as Chairman of the NCPFP. He is aided by three coordinating Vice-&#13;
Chairmen who are appointed by the Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of&#13;
Finance and Ministry of Health.&#13;
3.          The NCPFP network extends downwards and is replicated at the&#13;
provincial, district and commune levels. In addition, the NCPFP also has a collaborator&#13;
network at the hamlet level which is responsible for outreach work in the field of&#13;
population and family planning. In recent years, the CPFP network has been involved in&#13;
the distribution of non-clinical contraceptives (condoms, resupply of pills), and it is&#13;
estimated that 27% of couples received contraceptives from sources outside the health&#13;
force. Also, the collaborator network is the only formal outreach system at the grass-&#13;
roots level, and though currently not equipped to provide community-based primary health&#13;
care, the collaborators have the potential to be developed into primary health outreach&#13;
workers.&#13;

CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF PROVINCES FOR PHC UPGRADING&#13;
The selection of provinces followed three major principles:&#13;
1.          Provinces with unfavorable fertility, family planning and health&#13;
indicators would be given priority in coverage. The three fertility and health indicators&#13;
taken into consideration were the total fertility rate, infant mortality rate and contraceptive&#13;
prevalence rate.&#13;
2.          To provide more equitable distribution of funds, provinces with&#13;
substantial previous or current donor commitments were excluded, though they&#13;
would still participate in those components of the project that are meant to be nationwide&#13;
(such as IEC and management development). In effect, the scoring led to the exclusion&#13;
of all provinces covered by the UNFPA third cycle, the UNFPA fourth cycle, AusAID-&#13;
assisted provinces, GTZ-assisted provinces, as well as those selected for coverage under&#13;
the National Health Support Project.&#13;
3.          Among the remaining provinces, efforts would be made to cover as much&#13;
of the rural population as possible.&#13;
In addition to the above principles, consideration was given to the geographical spread&#13;
of the provinces, and their management capacity. Viet Nam has seven geographical&#13;
regions which differ in terms of various factors such as terrain, ethnic composition and&#13;
access to health and family planning services. By choosing project provinces from the&#13;
different regions, it would be possible to design and implement a project which reflects the&#13;
differing needs of the regions. This criterion therefore allows for replication of the&#13;
project, if successful, since the 15 project provinces could serve as models in the specific&#13;
regions. The provinces selected to be covered under the project were also judged to have&#13;
above-average management capacity. This was considered to be particularly important&#13;
given that the Population and Family Health Project is the first of its kind in terms of size&#13;
and scope; the success of such a project therefore depends heavily on the management&#13;
capacity at both the central as well as provincial levels.&#13;
&#13;

MATRIX OF PROJECT INDICATORS&#13;
A.    THE RATIONALE FOR PROGRAM INDICATORS&#13;
1.          There is a need for a consistent set of indicators to monitor and evaluate&#13;
the Population and Family Health Project at various times in the project cycle. Within the&#13;
broad framework of project aims and objectives, a matrix of specific objectives and&#13;
indicators at various levels has been established for the purposes of project monitoring and&#13;
impact evaluation.  Indicators cover four broad categories: (1) project inputs; (2)&#13;
measures of capacity and process; (3) program outputs; and (4) behavioral and&#13;
demographic impacts. The matrix is shown in full in Table 7 and should be integrated into&#13;
project reporting formats and management and supervisory arrangements. Minor changes&#13;
may be made, as needed, in the matrix during project implementation. Arrangements&#13;
should also be made to regularly review these indicators of project performance and to&#13;
implement improvements in project design based on the updated information.&#13;
2.          Within this matrix, ten key indicators have been selected to measure project&#13;
impact and achievement regarding key specific project objectives. These are linked to the&#13;
policy principles, strategies and specific project activities, as well as the Government's own&#13;
objectives. These indicators correspond to the objectives and management processes of&#13;
the Project.  Most of the key indicators measure demographic impacts or program&#13;
outputs, because ultimately these are the broad outcomes that we hope to affect over the&#13;
duration of the project. These indicators attempt to give some sense of the impact of&#13;
project activities on the lives of individual people in the population. They are not intended&#13;
to provide step-by-step guidance for the management of programs at the CHC or mobile-&#13;
team level. A wider range of indicators (see Table 7) is required for that purpose.&#13;
3.           At a minimum, calculation of key indicators should be carried out prior to&#13;
the beginning of the project, at mid-term, and following completion of the project.&#13;
Current levels of the indicators (where known) and objectives are shown in Table 1.&#13;
Adjustment may be required after information from the baseline surveys and baseline&#13;
studies becomes available.&#13;

bearing age (15 to 49) who are using, or whose partners are using, any form of modem&#13;
contraception.&#13;
11.          Background:  Improvements in this indicator, which is sensitive to&#13;
program activities, imply that the birth rate and population growth rate will be reduced. It&#13;
also measures the effectiveness of project activities, including the acquisition and&#13;
disbursement of modem methods of contraception.&#13;

male sterilization, contraceptive pills, injectables, Norplant implants, condoms, and&#13;
diaphragms/jelly/spermicide.&#13;
13.          Data source and data collection:  To be collected in three project&#13;
surveys: (1) baseline survey, (2) mid-term review, and (3) final evaluation survey. Data&#13;
collection efforts should concentrate on gathering information on current use of&#13;
contraception (though data on ever-use is also useful). Results from these surveys should&#13;
be compared to other data collection efforts, such as population censuses, inter-censal&#13;
demographic surveys, and other sources, although project evaluation will be based on data&#13;
collected in the project surveys and special studies.&#13;

Supply-based Method Use as a Percentage of Total Contraceptive Use.&#13;
17.          Definition: This indicator measures the percentage of all family planning&#13;
users (including traditional method users) who use temporary, short-term, supply-based&#13;
methods of contraception.&#13;
18.          Background: One objective of the Population and Family Health Project&#13;
is to encourage women who use traditional methods of family planning for spacing&#13;
purposes to use short-term, supply-based methods of contraception.&#13;

Access to Family Planning Services.&#13;
24.          Definition: the percentage of women of reproductive age with easy access&#13;
to family planning methods.&#13;
25.          Background: access to family planning services can be measured directly&#13;
by distance to fixed facilities or travel time to them. To be accessible, the following&#13;
criteria must be met: the women must have access to at least one of the following: (1) a&#13;
community distributor of family planning services; (2) a family planning field worker in the&#13;
rural village or urban neighborhood, with visitation at least once every two weeks, or (3) a&#13;
fixed service point not more than one kilometer away.&#13;

access to FP        Total # of women of reproductive age ( 1549)&#13;
in the same yr&#13;
27.           Data source and data collection: Data for this indicator will be collected&#13;
in three project surveys: (1) a baseline survey, (2) mid-term review, and (3) final&#13;
evaluation survey. The data will be based on standard questions on whether or not&#13;
specific family planning services are available to women of reproductive age. If services&#13;
are available, the women will be asked a series of additional questions in a service delivery&#13;
module. Issues to be addressed include the source (including name) of closest supplier of&#13;
family planning services and supplies, proximity of service provider to questionnaire&#13;
respondent, and the frequency of visitation by mobile team members and whether mobile&#13;
team visits are predictable or ad-hoc. Questions should also address whether women have&#13;
access to services that are better than the closest supplier. Service availability modules&#13;
that have been developed by Macro International, Inc. for the Demographic and Health&#13;
Surveys (see the questionnaire for Namibia, for instance) could provide a useful starting&#13;
point in the design of this component of the Vietnam surveys.&#13;
The usefulness of this indicator can be greatly enhanced by combining&#13;
women's responses from the survey with facility records. For instance, for women who&#13;
report that a CHC is easily accessible, records from this facility could also be examined.&#13;
Useful records would include: a listing of contraceptives that were available in the facility&#13;
by week (or alternatively, a listing of stock-outs); a listing of medical personnel that could&#13;
prescribe various contraceptives by week; listing of contraceptives actually prescribed; etc.&#13;

28.           Coverage of data collection: The whole country.&#13;
29.           Disaggregation:  The key indicator will be reported for province-level&#13;
data, with reporting to the national level. Calculations for lower levels (districts) may&#13;
provide important information about where to enhance mobile team efforts. Urban/rural&#13;
indicators, as well as indicators for major ethnic minority groups, should also be&#13;
calculated.&#13;
30.           Frequency of data collection: Three data collection efforts are required:&#13;
at baseline, mid-term, and at completion of the project.&#13;
B.   MATERNAL HEALTH INDICATORS:&#13;
Met Need for Life-Saving Obstetric Care (LSOC).&#13;
31.           Definition: this indicator measures the proportion of women estimated to&#13;
have direct complications that are managed in facilities that can provide the basic services&#13;
that are required for obstetric complications&#13;
32.           Background: five major conditions are responsible for the majority of&#13;
maternal deaths in developing countries world-wide: hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia and&#13;
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, obstructed or prolonged labor, and complications&#13;
from  abortion.  These conditions are generally unpredictable emergencies for which&#13;
adequate emergency care is essential. Even when they can be predicted, the same level of&#13;
care will be needed. The provision of such care provides indicators that are more practical&#13;
and immediate than estimation of maternal mortality rates or ratios.&#13;
33.           Method of Calculation&#13;
No. of complicated deliveries (1) in past year that&#13;
Met Need   were managed in hospitals or facilities (2) that&#13;
for LSOC =&#13;
could provide ALL of the services listed in (3) * 100&#13;
Estimated number of direct obstetric complications among&#13;
pregnant women (4) in the same year.&#13;
Simplified to:&#13;
No. of complicated deliveries (1) in past year that&#13;
Met Need     were managed in hospitals or facilities (2) that&#13;
for LSOC =  could provide all of the services listed in (3)  * 100&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                            Annex 4&#13;
Where, (a) A "complicated case" is a woman who is diagnosed as having any one (or&#13;
more) of the following conditions: ante-partum or post-partum hemorrhage, prolonged or&#13;
obstructed labor, post-partum sepsis, complications of abortion, pre-eclampsia or&#13;
eclampsia, ectopic pregnancy, or ruptured uterus. If the woman has more than one of&#13;
these complications, select the most immediately life-threatening one; (b) Managed "in&#13;
hospitals or facilities that could provide ..." includes both women admitted with the&#13;
complication and women who develop the complication in the facility; (c) Basic services&#13;
that MUST be provided are: parenteral antibiotics, oxytocics, and sedatives; manual&#13;
removal of the placenta; removal of retained products of conception; and assisted (vaginal)&#13;
delivery. This condition assumes that both skilled staff and essential equipments and drugs&#13;
are available at the facility at all times. This is a minimum standard. More comprehensive&#13;
facilities should be able to provide all of the above services, plus obstetric surgery and&#13;
blood transfusions; (d) The denominator is based on two assumptions: that a roughly&#13;
constant proportion of pregnancies, around 15 percent, involve major complications and&#13;
that most of these require emergency care.&#13;

Numerator: facility records from DHC and higher levels.&#13;
Denominator: estimate of live births from demographic survey.&#13;
Special studies will need to be carried out in order to calculate this indicator. The studies&#13;
will be done at three points in time: (1) as a baseline at the beginning of the project; (2) at&#13;
mid-term; and, (3) at completion of the project.&#13;

- 78 -                           Annex 4&#13;
35.          Coverage of data collection: Key indicator will be calculated at the&#13;
province-level. Data should be collected for the whole country. Alternatively, the 15&#13;
project provinces can be compared to a representative sample of 15 provinces which are&#13;
not having improvements in the health infrastructure financed by the World Bank or Asian&#13;
Development Bank.&#13;
36.          Disaggregation: Calculation for major ethnic minority groups.&#13;
37.          Frequency of Data Collection: Three studies are required: at baseline,&#13;
mid-term, and at completion of the project.&#13;
Total Abortion Rate (TAR).&#13;
38.         Definition: The TAR measures the number of abortions a woman would&#13;
have in her lifetime if current levels of abortion persist. This rate is a sum of current age-&#13;
specific abortion rates, which may themselves be of interest if there are specific age&#13;
patterns of concern in abortion.&#13;
39.          Background: The TAR takes into account the probability of becoming&#13;
pregnant and the probability of terminating each pregnancy throughout the reproductive&#13;
life cycle. It also indicates how widely and effectively contraceptive services are used. It&#13;
may also be useful to calculate a Total MR Rate.&#13;
40.          Method of Calculation:&#13;
49              45-49&#13;
TARi,t = ZASARi., = 5 * YASAR i,&#13;
i=15             i=15-]9&#13;
Where,&#13;
ASARj,t: the number of abortions in time t to 1000 women of a particular age i, i.e.&#13;
age specific abortion rates for women aged i in time t;&#13;
ASARi,j =    Total no.of abortions to women of age group i in time t x 1000&#13;
Number of women in age group i in time t&#13;
i: the five-year age groups of women of reproductive age (15-19 to 45-49).&#13;
t: a given year.&#13;
41.          Data source and data collection:  To be collected in three project&#13;
surveys: (1) baseline survey, (2) mid-term review, and (3) final evaluation survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -                            Annex 4&#13;
42.           Coverage of data collection: The whole country.&#13;
43.           Disaggregation:  Key indicator will be based on national-level data.&#13;
However, the following should also be calculated: (1) province-level TARs, (2) urban/rural&#13;
TARs, and (3) TARs for major ethnic minority groups.&#13;
44.           Frequency of Data Collection:   Three data collection efforts are&#13;
required: at baseline, mid-term, and at completion of the project.&#13;
Utilization of CHC facilities for antenatal care services.&#13;
45.          Definition: Percentage of pregnant women attended at least once for&#13;
pregnancy at the CHC-level.&#13;
46.           Background:  Prenatal care services contribute substantially to lower&#13;
infant mortality and can effectively alleviate chronic conditions of pregnancy (anaemia,&#13;
hypertensive disorders, infections).&#13;
47.          Method of Calculation:&#13;
No. of pregnant women who were seen at a CHC&#13;
% of pregnant in past 5 years for reasons related to their pregnancies * 100&#13;
women attended = Total # of pregnant women in past five years&#13;
Simplified to,&#13;
No. of pregnant women who were seen at a CHC I&#13;
% of pregnant in past 5 years for reasons related to their pregnancies * 100&#13;
women attended = Total number of births in past 5 years + (25%&#13;
of total number of births in past five years)&#13;
48.           Data source and data collection: The data for this indicator is to be&#13;
collected in three project surveys: (1) baseline survey, (2) mid-term review survey, and (3)&#13;
final evaluation survey. The indicator measures pregnancy-related utilization of prenatal&#13;
care in the past five years. The long time interval allows the estimation of statistically&#13;
significant estimates based on a large number of pregnancy cases. It is also useful to&#13;
evaluate whether women who were pregnant in the last year utilized the services,&#13;
particularly if quality improvements had been implemented in the past year, but the results&#13;
should be interpreted with caution because of the smaller sample sizes.&#13;

- 80 -                           Annex 4&#13;
50.          Disaggregation: The key indicator will report province-level data, with&#13;
reporting to the national level.  However, the following indicators should also be&#13;
calculated: (a) urban/rural (b) by age group of the mother (c) by parity of the mother and&#13;
(d) by major ethnic minority group.&#13;
51.          Frequency of data collection: Three data collection efforts are required:&#13;
at baseline, at mid-term, and at completion of the project.&#13;
C.    INFANT AND CHILDHOOD INDICATORS:&#13;
Infant Mortality Rate (IMR).&#13;
52.          Definition: The number of deaths of infants under I year of age per 1,000&#13;
live births in a given year.&#13;
53.          Background: The IMR, a well-defined demographic measure, is a good&#13;
indicator of the general health status of a given area or population.&#13;
54.          Method of calculation:&#13;
IMR =    No. of deaths to infants under age one in a given year * 1000&#13;
Total number of live births in the same year&#13;
55.          Data source and collection: The data are to be collected in three project&#13;
surveys: (1) baseline survey, (2) mid-term review survey, and (3) final evaluation survey.&#13;
56.          Coverage of data collection: The whole country.&#13;
57.          Disaggregation: National- and province-level IMRs are required. The&#13;
following should also be calculated: (1) urban/rural IMRs, (2) IMRs by sex, and, (3)&#13;
IMRs by major ethnic minority group.&#13;
58.          Frequency of data collection: Three data collection efforts are required,&#13;
(I) at baseline, (2) at mid-term, and (3) at the completion of the project.&#13;
Proportion of one-year-olds who were fully immunized as infants.&#13;
59.          Definition: Proportion of one-year-olds were fully immunized as infants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -                             Annex 4&#13;
60.           Background:  UNICEF recommends that infants receive 8 injections&#13;
against six major causes of disease in the first year of life. This indicator measures the&#13;
proportion of infants (per 100) who are immunized before their first birthdays against:&#13;
&gt; diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (3 injections);&#13;
&gt; poliomyelitis (3 injections);&#13;
&gt; measles (1 injection);&#13;
&gt;tuberculosis (linjection).&#13;
61.           Method of calculation:&#13;
No. of children in a given year who are currently exactly aged 1 who&#13;
were given all 8 doses of 6 kinds of vaccine in the&#13;
% fully     previous year                                    * 100&#13;
immunized = No. of children in a given year who are currently&#13;
exact aged I&#13;
This indicator is based on one-year olds to avoid truncation bias, i.e. to catch infants after&#13;
they have had the opportunity to have received the full immunization schedule during&#13;
infancy.&#13;
62.           Data source and data collection: Special studies will need to be carried&#13;
out in order to calculate this indicator. The studies will be done at three points in time: (1)&#13;
as a baseline at the beginning of the project; (2) at mid-term; and, (3) at completion of the&#13;
project. The numerator will be based on health cards and other facility records from&#13;
facilities within province. The denominator will be an estimate of one-year-olds from a&#13;
demographic survey.&#13;
63            Coverage of data collection: The key indicator will be calculated at the&#13;
province-level. Data should be collected for the whole country.&#13;
64.           Disaggregation: By urban/rural; by sex; and by major ethnic minority&#13;
group.&#13;
65.           Frequency of Data Collection: Three special studies are required: at&#13;
baseline, mid-term, and at completion of the project.&#13;

D.    INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY INDICATORS:&#13;
Management information score.&#13;
66.          Definition: This indicator, the management information score, is a&#13;
measure of the access to current information on key areas of program functioning,&#13;
covering such areas as facilities and equipment, personnel, commodities and logistics,&#13;
finance, and service statistics&#13;
67.          Background: A measure of institutional capital.&#13;
68.          Method of calculation: The management information score is defined as&#13;
a single number, from 0 to 13, which indicates the availability of the following 13 items of&#13;
information in the central program office. All must be complete and no more than one&#13;
year old to score an affirmative point.&#13;
Management Information Score&#13;
1.    Infrastructure/Inventory&#13;
-     Number, type and location of all service delivery points&#13;
-     Equipment Inventory, specify location and condition&#13;
-     Vehicle inventory, specify location and condition&#13;
2.    Human Resources/Training&#13;
-     Number of staff by current assignment&#13;
-     Number and location of Vacant Positions&#13;
-     List of scheduled training courses and number of trainees by type&#13;
3.    Procurement&#13;
-     Quantity of each commodity procured&#13;
-     Quantity of each commodity disbursed to lower levels&#13;
-     Inventory levels for each commodity at distribution point&#13;
4.    Administrative&#13;
-     Funds budgeted by major budget line item&#13;
-     Expenditures by major budget item by district&#13;
5.    Service Delivery&#13;
-     Number of family planning and health visits by District&#13;
-     Number of new family planning acceptors by method and District&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -                           Annex 4&#13;
This score implies that information of each type contributes to a more effective program.&#13;
Note that all of this information does not have to be present for the score to be calculated.&#13;
Most programs will be lacking at least some types of information, but even if a program&#13;
lacked every one of these types, it could still be assigned a score, namely zero.&#13;
69.                Data source and collection: The list of 13 items should be&#13;
available in the central office of the National Committee for Population and Family&#13;
Planning (NCPFP), based on information collected from provinces and lower levels.&#13;
70.          Coverage of data collection: Management information score required at&#13;
national-level.&#13;
71.          Disaggregation: None required, but it would be useful for lower-level&#13;
officials (province-level down to service delivery points) to have access to the same set of&#13;
data for their respective units to assist in the management of programs.&#13;
72.          Frequency of data collection:   At a minimum, the management&#13;
information score should be estimated at baseline, mid-term, and at the completion of the&#13;
project. An annual compilation of the score, coupled with a plan to improve data&#13;
management for the areas that are deemed weak, would be ideal.&#13;

PROVINCIAL PHC SYSTEMS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.             One of the objectives of the project is to strengthen the delivery of family&#13;
planning/reproductive health/primary health through basic health facilities. The grassroots&#13;
health system in Viet Nam consists of the commune health center (CHC) which is the first&#13;
point of contact between the community and the health force; and the district health center&#13;
which acts as a first referral facility for the CHC. In addition, provincial MCH/FP centers&#13;
play a significant role in the training and supervision of the lower levels. The project,&#13;
therefore, provides inputs to all three levels in an effort to strengthen service delivery.&#13;
Commune Level&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
2.             The commune health facilities can basically be divided into two categories -&#13;
(a) out-patient facilities and (b) in-patient facilities.  Under the project, the options&#13;
available for facility strengthening are:&#13;
Categories of Facilities     No intervention         Renovation            New Construction&#13;

3            The area which will be renovated in the CHCs for out-patient services&#13;
would be 70sq.m and the area of CHCs which would be renovated with in-patient services&#13;
would be 95sq.m. When considering new construction, the area of the CHC would be&#13;
kept to a minimum (initial estimates were about 70sq.m) without compromising the&#13;
delivery of services. This implies that when a CHC would need in-patient services, all&#13;
efforts would be made to ensure that health service delivery norms are maintained and&#13;
additional area would be provided if necessary. A total of 1616 CHCs would be&#13;
renovated/constructed in the 15 provinces under the project.&#13;
4.           In addition to the commune health centers, the project would also be&#13;
supporting the construction of health posts at the commune level on a pilot basis, in the&#13;
high mountainous and island areas of the country (which are currently not being reached&#13;
by the health system). These health posts will consist of a room with examination capacity&#13;
and area for a health worker to reside on the premises. The estimated area is about&#13;
27sq.m and the number of such health posts would be 440.&#13;
Furniture, Basic Medical Equipment, Essential Drugs and Medical Supplies&#13;
5.           All CHCs in the 15 project provinces (3190) would receive a package of&#13;
furniture, basic medical equipment and essential drugs and medical supplies which would&#13;
support the family planning and family health service delivery functions of the health&#13;
center. The actual quantities would be based on the results of the infrastructure survey of&#13;
existing furniture, equipment and drugs and medical supplies in the CHCs. This would be&#13;
further fine-tuned at the provincial level, based on any changes (supplies from Government&#13;
or other donors) that may occur in the interim period.&#13;

6.             The role of DHCs as a first-referral facility for providing basic health care&#13;
to a community clearly rmandates investments in specific areas of the DHCs which are&#13;
primarily used in its function as a support facility for CHCs. All DHCs in the 15 provinces&#13;
will be eligible for renovation. The proposed renovation includes out-patient area for the&#13;
provision of family planning, maternal and related reproductive health services; in-patient&#13;
area for the provision of family planning, maternal and related reproductive health&#13;
services; operation theater for obstetric and surgical services; central sterile supplies&#13;

which will be renovated under the project is 184.&#13;
Furniture, Medical Equipment, Essential Drugs and Medical Supplies&#13;
7           All DHCs in the 15 project provinces (184) would receive a package of&#13;
furniture, medical/surgical/obstetric equipment and essential drugs and medical supplies&#13;
which would support the family planning and family health service delivery functions of&#13;
the health center. The actual quantities would be based on the results of the infrastructure&#13;
survey of existing furniture, equipment and drugs in the DHCs. This would be further&#13;
fine-tuned at the provincial level, based on any changes (supplies from Government or&#13;
other donors) that may occur in the interim period. The package of inputs would also&#13;
include equipment and drugs and medical supplies that would be invested in the district&#13;
mobile units which provide technical and managerial supervision for the CHCs.&#13;
Provincial Level&#13;
8.          Though the provincial level is a higher level facility which is not directly&#13;
involved in the delivery of FP/MCWprimary health services, the project has included&#13;
inputs for the 15 provincial MCH/FP centers. This is because of the important role that&#13;
MCH/FP centers play in providing training support for MCH/FP activities. Also, many of&#13;
these provincial MCH/FP centers support the technical activities of the DHCs by sending&#13;
provincial mobile units on a periodic basis to the district level. Given these important&#13;
functions of the MCH/FP centers in supporting grassroots and first-referral MCH/FP&#13;
activities, it was deemed necessary to provide a package of inputs to the MCH/FP centers&#13;
which would complement the inputs at the district and commune levels.&#13;
9.           The civil works, fumiture, equipment and drugs and medical supplies that&#13;
is to be provided at the MCH/FP centers are quite similar to the inputs at the district level.&#13;
These inputs would ensure adequate capacity at the MCH/FP centers to discharge its&#13;
functions as a training and supervisory support unit for the lower level facilities.&#13;

Implementation Of Civil Works&#13;
Pre-Contract Stage&#13;
10.           The implementation of the works was discussed with the MOH Deparment&#13;
of Medical Equipment and Construction (DMEC) and officials at the Provincial&#13;
Department of Construction (DOC).  The pre-contract procedures are confirmed as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)    (a)    NCPFP/PMU  will be responsible for initiating, monitoring and&#13;
ensuring correct implementation procedures at each stage. The PMU&#13;
issues guidelines, bid instructions and the model drawings to the Provincial&#13;
PMU, who must then implement the civil works accordingly.&#13;
(b)    (b)    The Provincial PMU selects local consultants, using procedures&#13;
acceptable to the World Bank and they in turn do their own detailed&#13;
survey/inspection of the existing facilities and prepare design proposals,&#13;
based on the PMU models, for NCPFP/PMU approval on receipt of which:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -                          Annex 5&#13;
(i)    A Provincial Bidding Commnittee is formed, representing the PMU,&#13;
MOH DOC, MOF, and specialists necessary with the Chairman from&#13;
the PCPFP service;&#13;
(ii)   The Provincial PMU initiates the preparation of the bidding documents,&#13;
to include - working drawings, bills of quantities, specifications and&#13;
contract requirements which must again be approved by NCPFP/PMU.&#13;
(iii)   Tenders/bids are then invited by public advertisements in National&#13;
newspapers and television in accordance with WB guidelines&#13;
Contract Packages&#13;
11.          Contractors are registered in Viet Nam according to their resources and&#13;
ability. Accordingly, facility proposals will be combined into contract packages by&#13;
District, to encourage the larger contractors to compete. This is usually more cost&#13;
effective and quicker in construction.&#13;
(a)   Contractors are to be post qualified. For bid invitation and documents are&#13;
issued on payment of a deposit. An adequate tender period must be allowed to&#13;
ensure fair and open tendering.&#13;
(b)   On their return, the bids are examined and the lowest evaluated and responsive&#13;
bid is recommended. The results are submitted to the NCPFP/PMU for approval&#13;
(World Bank approval is necessary above a threshold of US$200,000) and on receipt,&#13;
the contract is awarded.&#13;
(c)   The Contract is signed between the PCPFP/PM`U (side A) and the successful&#13;
contractor (side B)&#13;
Contract Supervision&#13;
12.          Contract Supervision is the responsibility of the Provincial Engineer, DOC&#13;
whose representative visits the site daily to ensure proper progress, implementation and&#13;
material tests to specification and reports monthly to the PMU Contruction Manager. The&#13;
consultant, who prepared the designs and bidding documents also visits the site regularly&#13;
to ensure compliance with the design. The provincial PMU monitors the work and reports&#13;
to the NCPFP/PMU. A weekly report signed jointly by the DOC supervisor and the&#13;
contractor is sent to the Provincial PMU who will normally report monthly to the&#13;
NCPFP/PMU:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -                           Annex 5&#13;
(a)   stage payments are agreed e.g. on completion of Foundations, walls, roof, etc&#13;
and&#13;
(b)   when a stage is reached and a payment is due:&#13;
(i)    A meeting is arranged to confirm and certify payment at which the&#13;
following are represented - Side A, User, DOC, Supervisor and&#13;
Contractor;&#13;
(ii)    On completion of the works, the Committee meets to certify&#13;
satisfactory completion and works are handed over to the User;&#13;
(iii)   A Maintenance period of 12 months is included in the Contract Articles&#13;
during which a retention is held pending successful contract&#13;
completion. For this project, the recommended retention rate is 5%.&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
13.          In order to fulfil its role of monitoring the civil works component, the&#13;
NCPFP/PMU will require a Construction Manager with a staff of three - an architect and&#13;
two construction engineers, one of which should have specific experience in construction&#13;
valuation. In addition, one architect/construction engineer should be employed at the&#13;
Provincial PMU to assist the supervision at District level.. These staff can be employed on&#13;
contract for the duration of the civil works implementation.&#13;
Civil Works Documentation&#13;
14.          Incomplete filing and records can considerably delay reimbursements&#13;
during implementation so the mission wishes to stress that all procurement of consultants,&#13;
contractors and materials should be clearly demonstrated to be open, fair and in full&#13;
compliance with World Bank Guidelines. Accordingly, files must be up to date and&#13;
complete with all letters, meeting minutes, records and approvals to be typed, authorised,&#13;
dated, stamped where necessary and signed. A copy of the following procurement&#13;
documentation, etc. should be available on file for reimbursement clearance and particular&#13;
attention is drawn to the correct sequence of NCPFP/PMU approvals necessary&#13;

Maintenance And Repair Strategy&#13;
15.         Buildings are seen in terms of capital cost only, whereas a building has a&#13;
lifespan - if unmaintained perhaps 25/30 years - if well maintained perhaps 60/75 years.&#13;
The graph in Annex 4 shows maximum theoretical deterioration at minus 70% and when&#13;
applied to the building life cycle, the total actual building costs are as follows:&#13;
Unmaintained building over two generations (60 yrs) - Initial construction cost + one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -                          Annex 5&#13;
70% replacement i.e. 10 million + 70% 10 million = 17 million - Cost of same building&#13;
properly maintained for same period - Initial construction cost + 0.21% pa = 11.5&#13;
million. This represents a powerful economic arguernent for the proper preventive&#13;
maintenance of building stock.&#13;
16.         The maintenance of health/MCH/FP facilities has been the responsibility of&#13;
the Provincial People's Committee but in practice there has been no specific budget for&#13;
maintenance, so that there has been little upkeep of buildings - preventive maintenance -&#13;
for many years, other than emergency short-term repairs when absolutely necessary. A&#13;
strategy for preventive maintenance was drawn up during project preparation, including the&#13;
appointment of a senior experienced architect/engineer building as a member of the staff of&#13;
each Provincial Project Management Unit. This staff member would be responsible for the&#13;
program of upkeep and maintenance of all the health facilities, including services (water,&#13;
electricity, and siteworks), and would be provided a regular maintenance budget. The annual&#13;
budget for maintenance of civil works would be equivalent to one percent of the cumulative&#13;
value of investment in civil works under the project, and the annual budget for maintenance of&#13;
equipment would be equivalent to two percent of the cumulative value of equipment purchased&#13;
under the project. The actual maintenance work would be contracted out.&#13;
CLINICAL TRAINING SUB-COMPONENT&#13;
17.          Support to clinical training under the proposed Population and Family&#13;
Health Project was finalised by the NCPFP, in consultation with the MCHIFP Department&#13;
of the Ministry of Health, with additional discussions with the Science and Training&#13;
Department of the Ministry of Health, the School of Public Health and the Institute for the&#13;
Protection of Mothers and Newborn.&#13;
Objectives of the Clinical Training Component&#13;
18.         The focus of clinical training will be on the grassroots and local level staff,&#13;
ensuring that they have the knowledge and the skills to provide high quality infonnation&#13;
and services to potential and actual family planning clients as well as to integrate provision&#13;
of family health with family planning services. Upgrading training will be given to clinical&#13;
staff to improve their specialized knowledge and implementation capabilities. Training&#13;
activities will be monitored, evaluated and updated to ensure their continuing relevance to&#13;
programme needs.&#13;

19.          The specific objectives are:&#13;
(a)   to improve the quality of FP/family health service delivery and to offer&#13;
a wider range of contraceptive choice to clients; and&#13;
(b)   t:o improve the effectiveness and efficiency of MCH/FP training&#13;
interventions at the field level&#13;
20.          7 main areas of support are proposed for clinical training under the&#13;
Population and Family Health Project:&#13;
1)    Retraining of CHC staff in MCH/FP skills;&#13;
2)    Retraining of District-level supervisors of CHC staff,&#13;
3)    Competency upgrading in specific FP and reproductive health interventions;&#13;
4)    Managernent of training at the provincial level;&#13;
5)    Specialist training for doctors in new FP methods;&#13;
6)    Regular updates for MCH/FP service leaders;&#13;
7)    Special MCH/FP training program for CHC staff in remote and mountainous&#13;
areas.&#13;
A summary of the training program is given in the following table.&#13;
Coordination Between the National Health Support Project and the Population and&#13;
Family Health Project&#13;
21.       Both the National Health Support Project and the Population and Family&#13;
Health Project are intended to include support for the retraining of CHC staff in basic&#13;
MCH/FP knowledge and skills within their respective provinces and for the training of&#13;
district-level supervisors of CHC services. Common training packages are planned to be&#13;
used for this training in the 15 provinces covered by the National Health Support Project&#13;
and in the 15 provinces covered by the Population and Family Health Project. The&#13;
development costs for the MCH/FP retraining program have been included under the&#13;
Population and Family H[ealth Project, whilst those for the Supervisory Training package&#13;

Special MCH/FP training programs for CHC Staff in remote and mountainous areas:&#13;
22.         There iis a severe shortage of health staff working in the remote&#13;
mountainous areas of the country.  In these areas, a significant proportion of the&#13;
population are from minority groups with low levels of basic education. These low levels&#13;
preclude candidates from the minority groups from qualifying for entry to the Secondary&#13;
Medical Schools for formal health training. CHCs in these areas, if staffed at all, may have&#13;
a staff member seconded from the DHC, often not from the region at all and not&#13;
conversant with the local language. To improve basic health services in these areas, there is&#13;
the need both to develop a strategy for increasing the number of health workers drawn from&#13;
the minority groups, as well as to upgrade the skills of those staff already in service. Details are&#13;
given in Annex 15.&#13;

OUTLINE OF  4lc STRATEGY AND INPUTS UNDER THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Goal&#13;
I .         The goal of IEC is to support the program's service delivery and to create&#13;
long term demand for population and family health services. While social and cultural&#13;
conditions may require many issues to be addressed, IEC will remain focused on a limited&#13;
set of priority objectives based on the requirements of service delivery.&#13;
B.    Objectives&#13;
2.           By the end of the project period, the IEC component will seek to achieve&#13;
the following major objectives for the project (secondary objectives are not included here&#13;
and may differ from province to province):&#13;
In plains/'delta areas, 90 percent of eligible couples should:&#13;
(i)   know about at least 3 modem contraceptive methods (from among&#13;
ills, IUDs, injectibles, implants, condoms and sterilization);&#13;
(ii)  be favorably inclined toward using a modem method; and&#13;
(iii)  should have tried at least one modem method.&#13;
In other areas, this proportion should be at least 60 percent.&#13;
3.          In plains/delta areas, 90 percent of women of reproductive age should&#13;
know how to prevent and recognize reproductive tract infections (RTI) and, should the&#13;
need arise, know where to seek treatment. In other areas this proportion should be at&#13;
least 60 percent.&#13;
4.          In plains/deltas areas, 90 percent of pregnant women should know the&#13;
benefits of obtaining antenatal care, should have sought such care at least twice during&#13;
their pregnancy, and should be aware of the steps to be taken in case of an obstetric&#13;
emergency.&#13;
5.          There will also be some secondary objectives for the IEC component.&#13;
These are secondary because changes being sought will take place over a long period of&#13;
time or because other agencies are playing the lead role.  Such objectives include&#13;
promoting the small family norm among youth in secondary and vocational school&#13;
systems, educating the young about safe sex supporting the promotion of immunization&#13;
and good nutritional practices, as well as other MCH activities.&#13;
&#13;

C.      Strategy&#13;
6.               The development of IEC strategy is based on defining target groups relevant for each&#13;
objective, determination of wvhat has to be communicated to each group, development of messages and the&#13;
choice of media to deliver the messages to the groups being targeted. Target group definition will rely on&#13;
KAPB survey (including media habits) to be conducted at the start of the project and a multimedia&#13;
strategy will be chosen on the basis of media data obtained from the survey. Pending such data, key&#13;
elements of the IEC strategy under the project are presented in the matrix below.&#13;
7.              Description of institutional capacity strengthening required for effective implementation&#13;
is described in a later section.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -                            Annex 6&#13;
D.    Implementatioin: Message and Materials Development&#13;
8.           The matrix presents only the broad features of the IEC  strategy.&#13;
Implementation programs will need to be drawn up for each objective-target group-&#13;
message combination that sharpens the features for greater impact. For example, in&#13;
targeting women with one child, women who are breast feeding the child would be&#13;
addressed differently compared to women who have stopped breast feeding. To the&#13;
former, the message concerning pills would advocate the progestogen-only pill, while to&#13;
the latter the low-dose combined pill would be promoted. Again, messages for women in&#13;
minority groups would be different, as also for women who are in remote areas and&#13;
therefore less likely to be literate. In some urban areas such as Ho Chi Minh city, there&#13;
may be local campaigns to alert teenagers about the need for safe sex.&#13;
9.           The next step would be to create and produce the materials. This requires&#13;
answering questions about what the target groups know, think and feel about the topic&#13;
(KAPB data is useful here for segmentation, plus informal observation or small qualitative&#13;
studies to really understand why people are holding the beliefs or practising the behavior&#13;
that KAPB is showing), what symbols, language, phrases and other culture-related&#13;
elements can be used in communication to establish closer links with the target group, and&#13;
what opportunities or limitations are imposed by the media that will be carrying the&#13;
message.&#13;
E.    Implementation: Field Activities&#13;
10.          IEC activities in the field -- at the grass roots level -- are vital. Large&#13;
sections of the population are not reached by mass media. Even when they are, grass-&#13;
roots activities generate some excitement and stimulate discussion of the topic which has&#13;
already been seen or heard on TV or radio. The impersonal nature of mass media,&#13;
therefore, is replaced by a local, topical event and word-of-mouth channels.&#13;
I1.          This component provides for field activities through collaborators' home&#13;
visits, wall paintings in communes, traditional drama for remote areas and special events&#13;
tied in with local radio and TV. For example, as part of a "campaign approach" a district&#13;
may ask all collaborators to launch an awareness drive for pills during a 6-week period,&#13;
follow this by having wall signs painted in communes over the following four weeks and&#13;
climax the campaign by having the district mobile teams carry a rented TV and video&#13;
cassette player to show films and spots on pills.&#13;
12.          An important requirement for this approach is that there should be close&#13;
coordination between national IEC planning and provincial / district field activities. This&#13;
will require an annual IEC plan which describes the combination of messages, target&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -                               Annex 6&#13;
groups and media on which attention will be focused in specific parts of the country&#13;
during specific periods of the year.&#13;
13.           To enable close coordination between national, provincial and district&#13;
levels, the  project supports  training  and  planning  meetings.    Supervisory  and&#13;
implementation capability in the field is also enhanced by the project providing for&#13;
mobility, rental of TVs and VCRs, painting of wall signs, folk theater for remote areas and&#13;
special IEC events.&#13;
F.    Implementation: Contracted Assistance&#13;
14.           External technical assistance would be contracted for the following aspects&#13;
of implementation:&#13;
a. training national and provincial staff:  international experts coming in the early&#13;
stages;&#13;
b. material development and production:    local IEC / advertising agency with&#13;
international affiliation being retained from&#13;
the public or private sector in Vietnam on an&#13;
annual contract;&#13;
c. special field events and activities:    folk drama groups, field promotion agencies&#13;
from the provinces.&#13;
15.           While provision has been made for short term overseas training for lIEC&#13;
staff, it is essential that training take place within the country as much as possible. There&#13;
are two reasons for this: first, the quality of training will benefit from trainers being&#13;
exposed to the realities of the country and second, a much larger number will be trained&#13;
and a sizable core group of IEC staff can be formed. This training is scheduled in the early&#13;
stages of the project so that benefits can flow during the project period.&#13;
16.           Assistance for material development and production will be provided by&#13;
contracting an agency from the public or private sector. Capacity for this purpose has&#13;
increased dramatically in the country in the last two years and is rapidly moving toward&#13;
high standards because of several partnerships that have been signed between Vietnamese&#13;
companies and international advertising agencies. The vital role that such an agency can&#13;
play is in increasing the impact of the materials by making them more interesting and&#13;
relevant to the target group. For the sake of continuity in thinking and accumulation of&#13;
experience, it would be desirable to contract an agency for an initial period of two years&#13;
and then renew based on performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -                             Annex 6&#13;
17.          Groups specializing in rural media will be contracted for field campaigns.&#13;
For example, if wall signs have to be painted in 5 districts in a province, it would be easier&#13;
to contract the Youth Union in that province, send them a design created by the private&#13;
sector agency contracted at the national level and let them paint it with modifications for&#13;
local relevance.&#13;
G.    EEC Training&#13;
18.          Training of IEC under the project will have two objectives. First, the capacity&#13;
to manage the component at the national level will be enhanced. Second, implementation&#13;
capacity will be strengthened at the provincial, district and commune levels. The underlying&#13;
premise to the training strategy is that, except at the commune level, IEC staff should be able to&#13;
develop and execute IEC plans and strategies to obtain end results, and that the conduct of EEC&#13;
activities should be left to commune level workers (such as through interpersonal&#13;
communication) or to specialists (such as for material development and production).&#13;
19.   EEC management capacity at the national level will be enhanced through inputs along&#13;
three channels:&#13;
(a)   contracting of international IEC experts to work with IEC  Department&#13;
managers in a "hands-on" relationship to develop and implement the JEC&#13;
strategy, as well as to develop the curriculum and materials for provincial,&#13;
district and commune level training (based on the training needs assessment).&#13;
Six man-months of such assistance has been provided during the first three&#13;
years of the project;&#13;
(b)    contracting of an IEC / advertising agency from the public or private sector in&#13;
Viet Nam to assist with materials development and production on a long-term&#13;
basis (initial contract of two years, subject to renewal based on performance);&#13;
(c)    short-term overseas training for selected national and provincial staff expected&#13;
to contribute to future capacity. Provision has been made for twelve persons&#13;
to obtain such training in the third and fourth years of the project.&#13;
20.   Training of provincial IEC staff will take place in the second year of the project. By&#13;
that time a core level of knowledge and skills will have been established at the national level by&#13;
the international experts and the first group of overseas trained staff having retumed. It is&#13;
envisaged that this training of provincial staff be carried out in two weeks by the Department's&#13;
national managers with the international experts being present as observers and resource&#13;
persons. It is important that the scheduling be timed in this manner because this is the last year&#13;
of intemational assistance provided by the project for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -                             Annex 6&#13;
21.          District and commune staff will be trained in the second and third years. It is&#13;
expected that one persont from each district will be trained by the provincial IEC staff with&#13;
national support by way of curriculum, materials and instructors, if necessary. Each group of&#13;
10 district staff will be trained at the provincial headquarters over a two week period. This&#13;
period will also be utilized to conduct a field campaign near the provincial town so that&#13;
classroom discussions can reflect on practical experience shared by the group.&#13;
22           Commune level staff training will have a strong applications bias. Provincial&#13;
IEC and Training staff will conduct a 7-day program for groups of 20 workers and complete&#13;
the province's IEC training of 200 workers during 10 weeks spread over the second half of the&#13;
third year.&#13;
23.          Refresher training of provincial and district staff is planned in the sixth year, the&#13;
duration being 7 days for each group. Collaborator training has been described in a separate&#13;
section.&#13;
H.    Social Marketing&#13;
24.           Social marketing is based on the principle that concepts and techniques&#13;
normally used for selling commercial products can also be applied to promote socially desirable&#13;
goods and services. Typically, the target for socially marketed products are the poorer sections&#13;
of society and, therefore, the price set for such products is based on subsidy rather than full&#13;
cost or market value.&#13;
25.          Although social marketing in Viet Nam has been introduced recently, it has&#13;
demonstrated that the promotion of branded contraceptives in an aggressive commercial&#13;
manner is capable of delivering impressive results. This component aims to accelerate social&#13;
marketing activity in the following ways:&#13;
encouraging the promotion of pills, particularly to lower income urban women;&#13;
*     encouraging the availability of pills at pharmacies; and&#13;
*     encouraging the promotion of pills in rural area&#13;
26.          According to the 1994 ICDS, approximately 2 percent of married women in&#13;
the country currently use the pill. Given this low base of users, as a first step it is proposed that&#13;
women in urban areas be targeted for increased pill usage. Specifically, under the project the&#13;
following expansion strategy will be initiated:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 111 -                            Annex 6&#13;
(a)    Bids will be invited from  social marketing agencies with demonstrated&#13;
experience to launch a new brand of low priced pills (VND 500 per cycle) in&#13;
five cities: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, Hai Phong, and Hue.&#13;
(b)   Pills will be supplied at no cost and the social marketing agency will be&#13;
expected to provide the brand name, packaging, distribution to pharmacies and&#13;
advertising and promotion support. The agency will be given complete&#13;
autonomy to make decisions on strategy and implementation within agreed&#13;
budgets.&#13;
(c)    The agency will also be expected to recruit, train and deploy promoters (they&#13;
must be women) to slums and low income areas in these five cities with the&#13;
task of oonverting non-users of modem methods to the pill, where conversion&#13;
will be defined as the user's agreeing to visit a doctor, obtain a prescription and&#13;
start purchasing pills from the nearest pharmacy (when regulations permit, pills&#13;
can be delivered to the users home by the agency's delivery system).&#13;
(d)   Promoters will be paid a fixed monthly salary and allowance based on&#13;
continued usage by the clients they have converted. This allowance will be&#13;
structured so that it will be possible for the promoter to earn an additional 50&#13;
percent of salary per month with reasonable effort.&#13;
(e)    The social marketing agency will be reimbursed for all packaging, distribution,&#13;
promotion and advertising costs after adjusting for the revenue earned from&#13;
sales of pill. In addition, a service fee will be paid to the agency to cover part&#13;
of its administrative costs.&#13;
(f)    The arrangement will be subject to regular monitoring by Project Management&#13;
of the accuracy and profile of client data provided by the promoters.&#13;
(g)   The initial contract will be for two years and will be renewed subject to&#13;
performance; alternatively, new bids will be invited after two years.&#13;
(h)    Annual expenses for this sub component would include:&#13;
Recruitment and training, 20 promoters&#13;
Pharmacists' orientation&#13;
Salary, 20 promoters&#13;
Allowance, 20 promoters at 50 percent of salary&#13;
Delivery costs,&#13;
Packaging, advertising, pharmacy promotion&#13;
&#13;

Supervision fee for administration&#13;
Monitoring by Project Management&#13;
(i)    The terms of reference and the selection of the social marketing agency will be&#13;
decided vvith the help of the international experts contracted for [EC training.&#13;
27.           Since substantial support will be provided for advertising of the socially&#13;
marketed brand of pills, an effort will be made to obtain distribution of this brand in pharmacies&#13;
located in places other than the 5 cities allotted to the social marketing agency. It is proposed&#13;
to secure such distribution in the following way:&#13;
(a)    Bids will be invited from  organizations with distribution systems already&#13;
delivering products to pharmacies in provincial and district towns (other than&#13;
the 5 being covered by the social marketing agency). It is expected that during&#13;
1996-97 the number of such organizations will increase considerably.&#13;
(b)    The bid will require the organization to deliver pills to pharmacies on a regular&#13;
basis with proper attention to stock handling and shelf life, train pharmacists in&#13;
the dispensing of this product, conduct promotional activities aimed at&#13;
motivating pharmacists as may be planned from time to time and provide&#13;
regular reports on the sales through each outlet.&#13;
(c)    The project will provide pills to the organization at a price such that normal&#13;
commissions are eamed by the distributors without the price to the final&#13;
consumer exceeding VDG 500 per cycle. Since sales of pills in small towns are&#13;
likely to be small, a service fee may have to be provided to attract organizations&#13;
to this proposal. In addition, for supporting the national family planning&#13;
program, the organization can be given non-financial reward by way of public&#13;
recognition.&#13;

PROJ1ECTIONS OF CONTRACEPTIVE USE AND COSTS&#13;
Part L. Calculation of National Contraceptive Commodity Requirements 1997-2002&#13;
1.          This annex describes the underlying assumptions that have been utilized to&#13;
calculate the needed quantities of contraceptive supplies for the years 1997-2002. The&#13;
calculations were based on contraceptive prevalence and method mix projections that&#13;
conform to NCPFP goals for the year 2002. Specific details follow.&#13;
2.           Assumed Prices.&#13;
(a)   Contraceptive pills: US$0.30 per cycle. Annual number of cycles required&#13;
per woman= 13.&#13;
(b)    Multiload IUDs from China: US$0.75 per unit. Assumed life of RJD: 4.0&#13;
years.&#13;
(c)   Norplant: US$25.00 per unit. Assumed life of Norplant: 4.5 years.&#13;
(d)   Injectables: US$1.00 per dose. Four doses per user per year. (Purchase&#13;
4.5 doses per woman).&#13;
3.           CMW  of Reproductive Age. An estimate of the number of currently&#13;
married women of reproductive age (15-49) was provided for 1989 by the census of Viet&#13;
Nam. The size of the CMW population was projected annually to year 2002 through&#13;
assumption of a declining growth rate. The annual growth rate (1989-1990) was assumed&#13;
to be 2.6%, falling to 2.0% in 2001-2002.&#13;
4.           Contraceptive Prevalence Rate. Minimal change in the contraceptive&#13;
prevalence rate (CPR) is projected between 1994 and 2002, but the importance of modern&#13;
methods relative to traditional ones is projected to increase substantially. The CPR will&#13;
only increase from 65.0%/o to 66.0% whereas the CPR for modern methods will increase&#13;
from 43.8% to 56.1%. Only a minimal reduction in non-users is assumed (from 35.0% to&#13;
34%).&#13;
5.           Overall Method Mix. Based on the 1994 Inter-Censal Demographic&#13;
Survey, of current users of family planning, 58% use long-term methods (IUD, female and&#13;
male sterilization, and Norplant), 10% use short-term methods (pills, condoms, injectables,&#13;
diaphragm/foam/ jelly), while 30% use typically less-effective traditional methods (periodic&#13;
abstinence, withdrawal, and others). The method mix is projected to alter such that the&#13;
mix in 2002 will be 60)% long-term, 25% short-term, and 15% traditional. This is&#13;
consistent with an increase in the CPR for modern methods from 43.8% to 56.1% over the&#13;
same time period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-114-                              Annex 7&#13;
6.              Long-Term  Methods. IUDs will continue to be the most prevalent form&#13;
of long-term family planning in Viet Nam, but their share among long-term methods will&#13;
decline slightly, from 89% in 1994 to 86% in 2002. New multiload IUDs will be supplied&#13;
to an estimated 20%  of IUD users. The proportion of long-term users with Norplant will&#13;
increase from  0%  to 2%  between 1994 to 2002. Full costs are assumed in the costing&#13;
tables. Female and male sterilization is projected to increase slightly, from 11% to 12% of&#13;
current users of long-term family planning services. The project will not incur additional&#13;
costs as a result of this change.&#13;
7.             Short-Term  Methods. Condom-use is currently the most prevalent form&#13;
of short-term method use in Viet Nam with 63% of the short-term users, following by&#13;
birth-control pills (33%), injectables (3%), and diaphragm/injectables (1%).  Increased&#13;
reliance on injectables and pills is assumed such that the method mix in 2002 will be: birth&#13;
control pills (36%), injectables (24%), condoms (39%), and diaphragm (1%). The project&#13;
will finance both injectalbles and oral contraceptives; condoms and diaphragms will not be&#13;
supplied.&#13;
8.             Detailed analysis for each of the methods is provided in the following tables&#13;

LOGISTICS ARRANGEMENTS FOR PROJECT COMMODITIES&#13;
1.           The Ministry of Health will provide logistics support for the project, and&#13;
for the National Health Support Project. This will include support for procurement,&#13;
warehousing and distribution of equipment, drugs and contraceptives financed under the&#13;
two projects.&#13;
2.           Separate support systems will be set up for equipment and for drugs and&#13;
contraceptives, since thieir requirements are different. Equipment is a one-time purchase&#13;
but needs installation and periodic preventive maintenance, while drugs and contraceptives&#13;
must be procured and distributed annually through the life of the projects.&#13;
3.           The existing logistics infrastructure will be utilised, since it has adequate&#13;
warehousing and manpower and has received inputs from both SIDA and UNFPA for&#13;
upgrading the facilities. MOH will use the first year of the two projects for ensuring that&#13;
the logistics system is in full working order, since the first consignments of equipment,&#13;
drugs and contraceptives will only be delivered in the second year.&#13;
4.           The role of MOH will be to develop this service organisation. NCPFP will&#13;
be involved at various stages, such as preparing technical specifications, both technical and&#13;
financial bid evaluation, and preparing distribution plans for commodities to be financed&#13;
under the project. The logistics system will be responsible for making compliance reports&#13;
to NCPFP for all support to the project, as input into the project MIS.&#13;
5.          The private sector will be involved to the extent feasible in the logistics&#13;
support system through a system of sub-contracting. It could play an important&#13;
complementary role in port-clearing and forwarding and transportation of commodities&#13;
from the central warehouse to provinces and districts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
120                            Annex 9&#13;
OUTLINE OF STRATEGY AND INPUTS FOR MIS&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT TRAINING UNDER THE PROJECT&#13;
Management Information Systems&#13;
MIS Goals within the Project&#13;
1.          The NCPFP Population and Family Health project is intended to strengthen&#13;
the overall management capacity within the Vietnam population and family health area.&#13;
This management improvement not only includes increasing the capacity of workers in the&#13;
field to better utilize information, but also increasing the range and quality of information&#13;
available for management decisions.&#13;
2.          The basic: goals of the MIS effort within the project will be to:&#13;
(a)   Strengthen managers' capacity for using information for planning,&#13;
prioritizing and monitoring population and family health activities through&#13;
training and availability of computer resources&#13;
(b)   Increase the quality of population and family health indicator data&#13;
(c)   Expand the use of information for management to include sources of&#13;
information not currently utilized for decisions (i.e training, [EC, service&#13;
delivery, etc.)&#13;
(d)   Broaden the range of information sources for information gathering and&#13;
validation (i.e use of surveys to correct population data)&#13;
(e)   Strengthen use of computers for data gathering and analysis at all levels for&#13;
decision support.&#13;
3.          The activities under the current project will significantly increase the&#13;
overall use of computerized information for management. Additionally, by focusing on a&#13;
decision support systenm (DSS) model, the project will increase the overall capacity to&#13;
effectively utilize informnation at all levels of the PFP/MCH system.&#13;
Overview of Population and Family Health MIS Project Activities&#13;
4.          The project will address the overall mix of activities necessary to increase&#13;
the management capacity of the population and family health system to deliver services,&#13;
and to strengthen the planning and prioritization capacity of its managers to better target&#13;
the population and family health resources available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
121                                        Annex 9&#13;
5.               It is recognized that the needs for information systems for the project goes&#13;
beyond the gathering of statistical information, which shows only the output/impact of&#13;
project activities. The MIS approach of the project will be to focus on the information&#13;
necessary for management of the inputs to the project and the improvement of the use of&#13;
information for management decisions.&#13;
6.             The activities in the project are directed at strengthening the overall capacity&#13;
for management of population and family health activities. Additionally, these activities&#13;
will increase the NC:PFP's overall capacity to implement National changes to the&#13;
population and family health system.&#13;
Project Activities and, Objectives&#13;
Activity                                          Objective&#13;
Systems Modifications                 "Rationalize" information collection&#13;
methods/volume with capacity (i.e appropriateness&#13;
of information collection at each level)&#13;
Expand collection of information to include District&#13;
level planning capacity (i.e. logistics systems, IEC campaign&#13;
planning, etc.)&#13;
Improve oversight of "contract" service delivery within&#13;
the MOH&#13;
Include information from additional sources to gather&#13;
information on Private Sector FP service delivery, etc&#13;
Expand the use of rapid assessment survey usage to&#13;
improve the quality of data.&#13;
Management Training                   Increase manager's awareness of use of information for&#13;
Planning&#13;
Increase manager's capability to collect, analyze and supervise&#13;
PFP information processes&#13;
Change manager's perception of information from "statistical"&#13;
to the use of information for decisions&#13;
Software Development                  Increase the use of computerized information systems for PFP&#13;
policy planing&#13;
Increase the use of computers for Provincial planning and&#13;
prioritization of activities&#13;
Strengthen the capacity of NCPFP to plan and implement national&#13;
computer information systems&#13;
Information Coordination              Increase the use of information from other sources for planning&#13;
and prioritization of PFP activities (i.e. education statistics, MOH&#13;
statistics, etc.&#13;
Systematize collaboration with other organizations which have PFP&#13;
related data (i.e. GSO, NGO's, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
122                             Annex 9&#13;
Scope and Phasing of Decision Support Activities&#13;
7.           The MIS component of the Project will be a national effort to cover all&#13;
Provinces. Given the large number of Provinces, fifty-three, and the variety of training&#13;
which is necessary for new management skills, it is not possible to implement the MIS&#13;
system all at one time. The Project will phase the introduction of systems and training so&#13;
that the overall burden of implementation will be reduced.&#13;
8.           Project irnplementation of computer systems will be phased separately from&#13;
the management training and introduction of new reporting systems, such as training&#13;
information. This separation is feasible since many of the new systems will not be initially&#13;
computerized, and because the impact of changing the paper management systems for&#13;
planning will be significant from the beginning.&#13;
General Methodology for Implementing MIS&#13;
9.    The management information systems under the project will cover the range of&#13;
systems for processing all population and family health activities in Vietnam. Three major&#13;
areas are to be addressecd during the life of the project to support MIS efforts:&#13;
(a)   Management Skills training&#13;
(b)   Revision of information systems for population and family health&#13;
management data&#13;
(c)    Computer systems for increased processing/analysis of data&#13;
The MIS effort in the project will be implemented by the MIS team directly under the&#13;
Minister, NCPFP, in coordination with the Project Management Unit, Planning and&#13;
Finance Department, and the Centre for Research and Information. Given the scope of&#13;
activities to be implemented under the project it is not possible for all components to be&#13;
implemented simultaneously throughout the country. Hence, a phased plan has been&#13;
prepared which will allovv a constant improvement in the management capacity throughout&#13;
the life of the project.&#13;
10.          The project office will be responsible for reviewing quarterly the MIS plans&#13;
for the project, and for approving all modifications to current information systems, and for&#13;
approving management training plans. Contracts for software development, and staff for&#13;
programming will be approved through the project office as necessary.&#13;
11.          The first two years of the project will be targeted at developing new MIS&#13;
systems, both computerized and paper, and developing and implementing training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
123                             Annex 9&#13;
programs for management skills. These systems will be tested in the first five provinces&#13;
prior to implementation on a national basis.&#13;
12.   The implementaltion of each of the systems will be determined based on the&#13;
necessary decisions to be made at each level. Training, in use of general management, and&#13;
specific systems, will be designed in conjunction with the MIS project efforts, and the&#13;
training department.&#13;

Description of MIS &amp;: Software Development&#13;
13.          The MI;S effort under the project will involve the coordination of a large&#13;
number of different offices to ensure appropriate designs for software, and for planning&#13;
training efforts. The basic goal of the MIS systems under the project will be to increase&#13;
the use of management information without increasing significantly the burden for&#13;
information collection and processing at the Commune level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
125                              Annex 9&#13;
14.          To achieve these goals the systems will be designed so as to collect and&#13;
integrate information from other sources, such as GSO, which will reduce the overall need&#13;
for the population and family health program to independently collection information. The&#13;
major level for computerized intervention will be at the Provincial level.&#13;
MIS Responsibilities/Scope of Activities (Staffing)&#13;
15.          Given that the MIS efforts will be responsible for coordinating activities&#13;
with all NCPFP departments, and have to work directly with the PFPFP in revision of&#13;
systems the implementing office must have substantial authority.&#13;
16.          Subject to NCPFP a separate Management Information department will be&#13;
developed under the P'roject to oversee the implementation of the National MIS&#13;
components.&#13;
17.          Staffing of the MIS will increase during the initial phase of the project. It&#13;
is estimated that the first two years will require additional programmers, and a designer to&#13;
develop the necessary systems.&#13;
MIS Coordinating Work Group&#13;
18.          Currently all offices of the NCPFP adequately share information related to&#13;
ongoing activities for planning, budgeting and research. However, the level of effort&#13;
under the project for MIS activities will significantly increase the need for coordination of&#13;
activities and information needs. The scope of the MIS activities, including all Provinces,&#13;
and stressing training as well as software development, demands that greater oversight and&#13;
guidance be given provided during the life of the project. Additionally, the widened scope&#13;
of the information to be gathered and utilized from different sources, and for different&#13;
activities, necessitates increased management control and prioritization by the NCPFP&#13;
Project Unit.&#13;
19.          The Project Unit at the beginning of the project will create an Management&#13;
Information Systems Coordinating Work Group. This work group will be responsible for&#13;
all MIS policy and operattional decisions within the NCPFP.&#13;
20.          The coordinating work group will be responsible for the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
(a)    Policy Development&#13;
(b)   Informatio:n System Planning&#13;
(c)    Oversight of System Implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
126                             Annex 9&#13;
(d)   Information Coordination&#13;
Technical Hardware Requirements&#13;
NCPFP Systems&#13;
21.          Computer systems will be installed within the NCPFP to increase the data&#13;
processing capacity for all national activities, and to provide necessary resources for&#13;
developing new software systems.&#13;
PCPFPs Systems&#13;
22.          Computer systems will be installed, phased over the life of the project, in&#13;
all Provincial offices.&#13;
Field Test Systems&#13;
23.          Specific computer systems will be installed for testing in selected District&#13;
offices, and in Urban centers.&#13;
24.          Under the national budget, approximately VDG 3 billion ($275,000) have&#13;
been allocated for Management training. More than 50 per cent is spent on conducting a 3-&#13;
month orientation course in which topics relating to demography, the national family&#13;
planning program and otlier such topics are covered. While different types of participants&#13;
go through these courses (from the national, provincial and district levels), the content and&#13;
design is held constant because of the basic nature of the ground being covered. In&#13;
addition, 7-day focused courses are also conducted for more specialized groups.&#13;
Management Training&#13;
25.          A substantial escalation is proposed under the project with the purpose of&#13;
improving curriculum and materials, as well as conducting the training in a programatic&#13;
manner so that all levels azre systematically covered. The following are the features of the&#13;
Management Training program:&#13;
(a)   The crux of the attempt to revitalize Management Training is the&#13;
development of a central team of six trainers who will serve as the core&#13;
full-time trainers for the program. They will be drawn based on their&#13;
specialization and training record from the leading academic institutions in&#13;
the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
127                             Annex 9&#13;
(b)   A team of international consultants will be contracted to train the core&#13;
team in training methodology, as well as to update their technical&#13;
knowledge in their own fields. These will consist of:&#13;
(i)    M[anagement systems and structures&#13;
(ii)   Research methods&#13;
(iii)   Management information systems&#13;
(iv)   Management of IEC&#13;
(v)   Materials and operations management&#13;
(vi)   Human resource management&#13;
(vii)  Financial management&#13;
It is planned that the training of the national trainers should be completed in&#13;
3 morths by the international tearn.&#13;
(c)   After the core team has been trained and the curriculum and materials&#13;
developed for the provincial level, a pool of provincial trainers will be&#13;
created by training 3 persons from the staff of each PCPFP, again over a 3-&#13;
month period. It will be the responsibility of this pool to continue the&#13;
training of district (3 per district) and commune level staff. All such&#13;
training will take place at the provincial office and district staff will not be&#13;
used as trainers.&#13;
(d)   In addition to creating the pool of provincial trainers, the core team will&#13;
also train other provincial staff (average of 2 per province) in management&#13;
by brinlging them  in to the national level.   A one-month course is&#13;
visualized, with batches of 60 provincial staff working in one sections.&#13;
26.          The project will also provide for overseas training for selected national and&#13;
provincial staff. The specific nature of this training will depend on the future perspectives&#13;
adopted by NCPFP, resources have been provided for long- as well as short-term overseas&#13;
training, including support for academic work in any of the fields mentioned earlier.&#13;
27.          Monitoring and evaluation will be done on the basis of a Training Needs&#13;
Assessment conducted at the start of the project and a rapid assessment two year after the&#13;
training activities have: commenced with the new curriculum. Refresher and subsequent&#13;
training will be based on these data.&#13;

ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE&#13;
SERVICE DELIVERY INITIATIVES COMPONENT&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
1.          A Service Delivery Initiatives Committee will be established within the&#13;
Project Management Unit (PMU) of the NCPFP to manage the Service Delivery&#13;
Initiatives component. Standing committee members will include the Director of the&#13;
PMU, the PMU Task Manager, and the PMU Family Planning Service Officer. A&#13;
designated representative of MOH will also join the committee for management of any&#13;
component activities concerning the development of private-sector involvement in&#13;
FP/reproductive health services.&#13;
2.          The tasks of the committee will be to solicit, develop, review and&#13;
administer implementation of proposals for financing under the component. It will&#13;
seek assistance in these tasks as appropriate from the PMU's Local Experts Task Force,&#13;
other local or international consultants, and other staff of the PMU, other departments&#13;
of NCPFP and of MOH.&#13;
Procedures for Processing Proposals&#13;
3.          The comiponent is intended to provide flexible and unstructured&#13;
financing. Although some activities have already been designed and costed in detail or&#13;
in outline during project preparation, it will also be open to innovative ideas and&#13;
proposals from all quarters.&#13;
4.          Thus, proposals for financing under the component can be originated and&#13;
developed in a variety of ways. They may be originated and prepared by the PMU&#13;
itself or by other departrnents of the NCPFP. They may be designed and submitted to&#13;
the committee by any external agency, including MOH. They may be solicited by the&#13;
committee from external agencies at large, with or without specific terms of reference&#13;
to guide proposal preparaltion.&#13;
5.          The committee will be responsible for development and preparation of&#13;
the final detailed design for the proposals that were decided upon during project&#13;
preparation and are outlined in Annex 11. In addition, it will, as appropriate, solicit&#13;
other proposals, prepare detailed terms of reference for desired topics, review proposals&#13;
that are submitted and decide on whether they should be componented. In all cases, the&#13;
proposals would specify ihe chosen procedure for implementing it and, if the proposal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-129 -                          Annex 10&#13;
involves pilots or testing of new approaches or service delivery systems, the&#13;
arrangements for evaluation of their success.&#13;
6.          Once proposals have been finalised and approved by the committee, they&#13;
will be submitted for review to IDA, or to ADB in the case of proposals relating to&#13;
development of the private/NGO sector, together with the procedure chosen for&#13;
implementing it. Upon approval by IDA or ADB, the committee will then manage&#13;
implementation of the proposal.&#13;
7.          Implementation again may be handled in a variety of ways, depending&#13;
on circumstances, at the discretion of the committee. The PMU may itself directly&#13;
implement the proposal, or arrange for its implementation through another Government&#13;
agency, such as MOH, MOLISA or GSO. This would be the case with the testing of&#13;
the health post and upgraded collaborator model systems, for example, where MOH&#13;
would implement the test and possibly MOLISA or GSO evaluate its success.&#13;
Alternatively, the committee may use a standard IDA or ADB bidding process to solicit&#13;
bids for the implementation of proposals, using the approved detailed proposals as&#13;
terms of reference for bidders. This might for example be the procedure chosen for&#13;
implementing some of the outlined studies, such as those on IUD and MR/abortion&#13;
determinants and service quality. If the latter process is followed, it would be subject&#13;
to the IDA or ADB procurement guidelines in force for all other procurement under the&#13;
project and would be implemented in the same way. The committee would then be&#13;
responsible for bid evaluation and final selection of consultants.&#13;
8.          The committee will be responsible for monitoring and supervision of&#13;
proposal implementation in all cases. When implementation is complete, and the&#13;
results and findings of surveys or evaluations are available, the committee will review&#13;
the overall success and implications of the proposal topic and report on it to IDA, ADB&#13;
and the Project Steering Committee.&#13;

INDICATIVE LIST OF TOPICS TO BE FINANCED UNDER THE&#13;
SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL INITIATIVES COMPONENT&#13;
Model Strengthened Collaborator System&#13;
1.          The current collaborator system is the principal channel of community-&#13;
based outreach for tlhe promotion of family planning.  However it is in need of&#13;
strengthening. At present the system consists of a very large number of part-time workers&#13;
who are paid very small monthly allowances of 15,000 dongs per month (plus incentive&#13;
payments for recruitment of acceptors of selected methods) and focus almost entirely on&#13;
the promotion of family planning.&#13;
2.           A new model system will be tested under component 5, and extended if&#13;
successful throughout the 15 project provinces under Component 1; it will feature much&#13;
reduced numbers of collaborators, who will become full-time workers paid higher&#13;
allowances of 120,000 dongs per month and cover promotion of family health as well as&#13;
family planning. An imlportant FP function would be the community-based distribution for&#13;
temporary methods such as pills (resupply) and condoms. The new name of Family Health&#13;
Worker will be given to these workers. The outline of the new model system is as follows:&#13;
3.           Forty five communes will be selected within the 15 project provinces for&#13;
testing the new model system. Twenty two will be located in remote mountainous areas or&#13;
isolated islands; eighteen in the delta regions; and five in midland or mountainous areas&#13;
falling between the tvvo previous extremes. A community needs assessment/feasibility&#13;
study will be carried out in each study zone, in order to ensure full community&#13;
participation, determine local cultural attitudes and values, and assess the existing health&#13;
infrastructure and referral system.&#13;
4.          In the remote mountainous/island areas, 7 workers would be selected per&#13;
commune; in the midland/mountainous areas, 5 workers; and in the delta plains, 3&#13;
workers, making up 233 family health workers altogether in the test. Selection criteria&#13;
would be determined locally on the basis of the community needs assessment and in&#13;
discussion with the communities. Normally, the most effective workers of this type are&#13;
those closest in social status, culture, age and experience; they should also be&#13;
contraceptors themselves. Other important criteria might include sex, literacy or&#13;
educational level, marital and childbearing status, health training, and appropriate&#13;
commitment and skills in interpersonal relations.&#13;
5.           The tasks of the family health workers would be fine-tuned on the basis of&#13;
the community needs assessment. However a likely minimum package would include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -                           Annex 11&#13;
(a)    motivation and recruitment of new  FP acceptors and support,&#13;
counselling and reassurance to continuing users; all supported by&#13;
adequate quantities of appropriate printed IEC materials which can be left&#13;
with clients, as well as by mass media messages&#13;
(b)   distribution of contraceptive supplies: using a simple checklist, workers&#13;
will initiate and resupply clients for short-term temporary methods such as&#13;
the pill and condoms; the low-dose combined pill would be supplied to&#13;
women who are breastfeeding or contraindicated for the use of oestrogen;&#13;
adequate quantities would be provided per visit (for example, six pill&#13;
packets) in order to reduce the number of visits needed per client; workers&#13;
with sufficient medical training could also be trained to give injectables&#13;
(c)   follow-up of contraceptive defaulters: workers would regularly follow up&#13;
both their own clients and those who obtained their method elsewhere&#13;
(d)   promotion and simple services for basic primary health care: workers&#13;
could promote, follow up on and perhaps provide simple basic care for&#13;
basic PH-C interventions such as EPI, CDD, growth monitoring and&#13;
appropriate maternal care; also disease control programs for malaria, TB,&#13;
iodine deficiency diseases etc.&#13;
6.           In order to carry out these tasks on a door-to-door basis, workers will be&#13;
provided where necessary with suitable transport such as bicycles or (in very remote areas&#13;
with difficult terrain and sparse settlements) motorcycles.&#13;
7.           Training of the family health workers would be fine-tuned on the basis of&#13;
the community needs assessments and resulting selection criteria for workers. Generally&#13;
speaking, the content of training would be kept very simple and concrete, using training&#13;
techniques appropriate to adults and oriented to the development of practical skills.&#13;
Training should last for at least 2 weeks, in order to allow adequate time for practical&#13;
training. Workers would be trained to:&#13;
(a)    provide accurate information on each contraceptive method they offer&#13;
(pills, condoms, injectables), including its proper use and side effects&#13;
(b)   discuss the advantages of family planning and birth spacing and describe&#13;
accurately all available methods, their correct use and their side-effects&#13;
(c)    provide advice on how to obtain clinical methods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-132-                             Annex 11&#13;
(d)   discuss the advantages of basic PHC and disease control interventions and&#13;
programs and provide accurate information on them&#13;
The training curriculurn would be prepared by revising the latest collaborator curriculum&#13;
developed with UNFPA support, in order to simply the material and add health topics.&#13;
8.           Medical back-up for the family health workers will be provided by CHCs.&#13;
To ensure that this back-up is effective, CHC staff in the study areas will be involved in&#13;
the planning of the new system and will be trained in technical supervision of the workers.&#13;
All CHCs in the study zones will be upgraded as necessary to provide good-quality&#13;
referral and back-up services.&#13;
9.           The objectives of supervision for the family health workers will be to:&#13;
provide support and back-up when problems arise; watch for any difficulties; and link the&#13;
family health worker system effectively to the mainstream FP program and to the health&#13;
system. Supervisors will also facilitate the supplying and restocking of the family health&#13;
workers and the collection of service statistics. Supervisors must possess appropriate&#13;
knowledge and experience and be able to take a supportive and encouraging attitude to&#13;
their subordinates. Full-time local CPFPB staff with these characteristics would be&#13;
recruited and trained, and supervisory instruments such as supervision manuals and&#13;
checklists would be developed and supplied to them. they would also be provided with&#13;
motorcycles in order to ensure adequate mobility for their operations.&#13;
10.          The family health workers will keep records of their work, including a&#13;
comprehensive record of each client's social, demographic and medical history plus the&#13;
management and services provided by the family health worker, and a record of stocks&#13;
held and IEC materials distributed by the family health worker. Data on the numbers of&#13;
new acceptors recruited and continuing users visited, plus the quantities of contraceptives&#13;
distributed, will be collected, compiled and submitted to the supervisor on a monthly basis.&#13;
11.          The test of the new system will last for two years. Its performance and&#13;
impact would be monitored and evaluated through both routine service statistics and&#13;
special community surveys, using data from neighbouring areas which continued with the&#13;
current system as comparators and controls. Indicators that might be employed to assess&#13;
trends attributable to the new system include: community knowledge of short-term&#13;
methods; the community CPR; changes in the method mix; appropriate PHC and disease-&#13;
control program measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133-                            Annex 11&#13;
Model Health Post System for Remote Mountainous Areas&#13;
12.         As described in Annex 15, a model health post system would be tested in&#13;
60 communes in remote mountainous areas in the 15 project provinces, and expanded&#13;
under Component 1 to all such areas in the 15 project provinces if successful. For a&#13;
commune to be eligible for coverage by the system, it must fulfill the following criteria:&#13;
(a)   the CHC must have at least 3 health staff&#13;
(b)   the CHC must be at least 4 hours walking distance from the nearest DHC&#13;
(c)   there must be strong commitment from the Provincial People's Committee&#13;
13.         A health post would be set up in one village in each commune. It would&#13;
consist of two small rooms, one of which would be a consultation room/office and the&#13;
other a bedroom. Basic furniture, medical equipment, a selection of essential drugs, and a&#13;
bicycle for household visiting would be supplied.&#13;
14.         The health post would be staffed by one of the CHC health workers, on&#13;
either a rotational basis or as a permanent assignment, according to the choice of the&#13;
workers. The health worker in residence would provide basic IEC and services for&#13;
MCH/FP, including the distribution of appropriate contraceptives and some minor curative&#13;
care. If the new family health worker system is also being implemented in the commune,&#13;
the health post might be staffed by the family health worker.&#13;
15.         The success of the health post system would be evaluated at the end of a&#13;
two-year test period of operation. Neighbouring areas that did not receive health posts&#13;
would be used as comparators. Both routine health service statistics and special&#13;
community surveys alt the beginning and end of the test period would be employed for&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. Indicators of performance and impact might include trends in a&#13;
selection of common PHC program measures, such as EPI rates and appropriate maternal&#13;
care, as well as data on community satisfaction with, and utilization of, the health posts.&#13;
Model Approaches for Mobilization of the Private/NGO Sectors in Family Planning&#13;
and Family Health&#13;
16.   These model approaches are aimed at expanding the provision of good-quality&#13;
family planning and reproductive health services by the private and NGO sector. they do&#13;
not include social marketing programs, which are funded under Component 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-134 -                            Annex 11&#13;
A.    Private Providers&#13;
17.          Since information on the scope, structure and performance of the private&#13;
sector in Viet Nam is so limited, the first step in designing model approaches to mobilizing&#13;
private providers will necessarily be data gathering. Two initial surveys will be undertaken.&#13;
The first will be a market research survey among doctors and possibly also other health&#13;
providers such as midwives and nurses, which will aim to determine the factors that&#13;
motivate or hinder them  in establishing or expanding a private practice in family&#13;
planning/reproductive health. The second will be a consumer survey that would examine&#13;
the attractiveness to actual and potential clients of obtaining such services through the&#13;
private rather than the public health sector.&#13;
18.          On the basis of results from  these surveys, model initiatives and&#13;
interventions would be designed for testing. Possibilities already under discussion include:&#13;
(a)    Creation of a pilot loan fund: A fund would be set up to provide credit to&#13;
doctors for the establishment or expansion of private clinics. Eligible&#13;
doctors would be those who include family planning/reproductive health&#13;
services as part of their practice. Allowable uses might include small-scale&#13;
upgrading of premises, and basic equipment and supplies needed to provide&#13;
or upgrade these services.&#13;
(b)   Provide updated training: Different mechanisms would be tested for&#13;
providing   updated  training   for  private  doctors  in  family&#13;
planning/reproductive health.&#13;
(c)    Mobilize  private  providers  to  service  remote  areas: Different&#13;
mechanisms would be tested for mobilizing private providers to bring&#13;
family planning/reproductive services to areas which are underserved.&#13;
Possibilities might include: special support schemes for midwives or other&#13;
paramedical cadres who would be interested in providing such services in&#13;
rural areas; incentive programs to attract doctors to rural areas; and special&#13;
time-sharing programs allowing private providers to utilize public health&#13;
facilities as premises for their service delivery.&#13;
Provide IEC materials: Specially adapted family planning/reproductive health EEC&#13;
materials would be designed and supplied to private providers including pharmacists.&#13;
(d)   Establish professional associations: Assistance would be provided in a&#13;
small number of provinces for the establishment of professional&#13;
associations of private providers offering family planning/reproductive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -                           Annex 1 1&#13;
health services; the purpose would be to create a forum through which the&#13;
concerns of such providers could be shared and addressed, information&#13;
could be distributed, and training seminars could be held.&#13;
(e)    Alleviate constraints to private practice: Attempts would be made to&#13;
alleviate any constraints identified as affecting the private provision of&#13;
family planning/reproductive health services, through policy papers,&#13;
seminars and other activities.&#13;
B.    Non-Governmental Organizations&#13;
19.          Information on the activities and performance of the two existing NGOs in&#13;
the family planning/reproductive health field is also extremely limited. It is therefore&#13;
difficult even to develop an outline of possible ways to mobilize the potentially very&#13;
valuable contribution of this source. Emphasis should probably be on the provision of low-&#13;
cost but good-quality services to particularly poor and underserved populations. However&#13;
the first priority would be to amass adequate information on the NGO sector. Thus the&#13;
NGO strategy would consist of two stages; first to obtain a data base for planning and&#13;
second to develop initiatives, as follows:&#13;
(a)    Evaluate existing NGOs: Active NGOs would be studied to evaluate their&#13;
performance, their impact to date and the reasons why clients prefer them.&#13;
(b)   Expand NGO activities to underserved areas: On the basis of the evaluation&#13;
results, initiatives would be identified, designed and tested for expanding&#13;
NGO services, probably with a focus on underserved groups.&#13;
Pilot Test of Charging for Contraceptives&#13;
20.          This pilot test will examine the impact  and feasibility of introducing&#13;
charges for contraceptives provided under public family planning services. The aim of the&#13;
charges would not be to achieve full cost recovery, but rather to increase the perceived&#13;
value of family planning services and hence raise the level and effectiveness of&#13;
contraception use. The pilot would measure the impact of different levels and structures of&#13;
charging systems on the utilization of public family planning services. It will be carried out&#13;
during the first three years of the project and its results evaluated as part of the project&#13;
mid-term review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-136-                            Annex 11&#13;
Model Approaches for Safe Pregnancy and Safe Motherhood&#13;
21.         Levels of maternal mortality appear to be anomalously high in Viet Nam,&#13;
given overall levels of life expectancy and health services. Important facets of matemal&#13;
health care, such as provision of iron and vitamin A supplements during pregnancy and&#13;
adequate delivery facilities for both normal and complicated deliveries, need improvement&#13;
throughout the country, but particularly in remote and underserved areas. These model&#13;
approaches would seek to improve the well-being of women during pregnancy and&#13;
delivery in a variety of ways. An initial list of models includes:&#13;
(a)    Reduction of Anaemia and Vitamin A Deficiency: Both anaemia and&#13;
vitamin A deficiency are very common among Vietnamese women of&#13;
reproductive age, and still more during pregnancy. They may lead to&#13;
various obstetric complications and compromise the health of infants born&#13;
to deficient women. Evaluative studies will be carried out to identify the&#13;
most successful model strategies for reducing these deficiencies. Such&#13;
strategies might include, in addition to provision of supplements as a part&#13;
of prenatal care, dietary supplementation with foods rich in iron and&#13;
vitamin A, treatment for underlying or resulting diseases (such as malaria&#13;
and general infections), and counselling and IEC on good nutritional&#13;
practices.&#13;
(b)   Safe Home Deliveries: Over forty percent of deliveries in Viet Nam still&#13;
take place at home, and 27 percent occur without assistance from any&#13;
health staff. Nearly two thirds of communes are without a secondary&#13;
midwife. Thus approaches need to be designed for improving home&#13;
delivery practices. An initial survey would be conducted to identify and&#13;
investigate any harmful practices, and to examine reasons for delivering at&#13;
home and/or without trained medical staff in attendance. On the basis of&#13;
the study results, model approaches would be designed and tested for&#13;
improving current home delivery practices and increasing utilization of&#13;
health facilities and staff for deliveries.&#13;
Management of High-Risk Pregnancy and Complications: About 15 percent of&#13;
deliveries world-wide suffer from obstetric complications (haemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia,&#13;
obstructed labour) that are potentially life-threatening and require specialized management&#13;
and facilities. Various model approaches would be designed and tested for improving&#13;
access to and utilization of appropriate facilities. These might include establishment of&#13;
"maternity waiting houses" near District or Provincial hospitals for women known to be at&#13;
high-risk of complications, programs to promote private practice in isolated rural areas (as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-137-                            Annex 1l&#13;
above), and programs to establish or improve systems for emergency referral and transport&#13;
in obstetric emergencies.&#13;
Model Approaches for IUD, Pregnancy Termination and RTI Services&#13;
22.          Levels of IUD use and pregnancy termination are very high in Viet Nam;&#13;
one third of married women are fitted with an IUD and the average number of&#13;
terminations per woman is estimated at 2.5. Likewise, RTIs are known to be extremely&#13;
prevalent among Vietnamese women, though the precise rate has never been measured.&#13;
All are interconnected, in that RTIs may complicate both IUD insertion and pregnancy&#13;
termination, and also result from either procedure if sterile conditions are not achieved;&#13;
moreover, IUDs are often in practice the only modern contraceptive method available to&#13;
Vietnamese women and if they are unacceptable for any reason (including RTIs),&#13;
termination may be the only practical alternative or may become necessary through the&#13;
failure of the rhythm method or withdrawal. All require improvement in service quality or&#13;
access to effective treatment, and the prevalence rates of RTIs and termination, at least,&#13;
need to be reduced. Model approaches to achieve these aims in all three areas will be&#13;
developed on the basis of improved data.&#13;
A.    IUD Program Impact Evaluation&#13;
23.          The IUI) has for decades been and still is the dominant modem&#13;
contraceptive method in Viet Nam. Many clinical studies on this method have been&#13;
conducted, but no evalLiation of its program impact. Therefore as a first step, a study of&#13;
national scope would be conducted to assess the acceptability of the IUD among&#13;
Vietnamese women, the common problems encountered by acceptors and users, the&#13;
training needs of service providers, and how well equipped facilities are to handle&#13;
problems and complications. This study would have four parts:&#13;
(a)   Review of IUD Patient Records: a national representative sample of IUD&#13;
client records will be reviewed from all levels of facility where lUDs are&#13;
provided. Data will be extracted on: demographic characteristics of&#13;
acceptors; selection criteria used for IUD users; the client follow-up&#13;
schedule., complaints and problems reported by clients; how these were&#13;
managed; level and patterns of method failure; and main reasons for&#13;
discontinuation.&#13;
(b)   Interviews with Current and Past IUD Users: a representative sample of&#13;
past and current IUD users whose records were reviewed in part (1) of the&#13;
survey will be interviewed. Current users will be questioned on: what and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-138-                           Annex 11&#13;
who motivated them to accept an IUD; what was their experience of&#13;
insertion; what were provider attitudes and care; whether or not they&#13;
received accurate information and effective support; how often they have&#13;
been followed up; whether they have any complaints or complications; how&#13;
satisfied they are with the method; and whether they would recommend a&#13;
friend or relative to use the IUD. Past users will be questioned on their&#13;
experience with the IUD: in particular whether they had complaints or&#13;
complications, were happy or not with the method, why they discontinued,&#13;
whether they switched to another method, which method they changed to,&#13;
and whether they would recommend a friend or relative to use an IUD.&#13;
(c)   Questionnaires Administered to HUD  Providers: Service providers&#13;
would be surveyed to examine: their knowledge of and attitudes to the&#13;
IUD and other contraceptive methods; their training in insertion and&#13;
removal; their current level of skill in counselling, client selection for IUD&#13;
use, insertion and removal techniques. In addition, focus-group discussions&#13;
with groups of providers would be conducted to elicit in depth their&#13;
attitudes and beliefs about the IUD in an informal setting.&#13;
(d)   Focus-Group Discussions with Women in General: Wide-ranging focus-&#13;
group discussions would be carried out with unselected groups of women&#13;
in the community, with the aim of eliciting: general attitudes to the IUD;&#13;
whether they are correctly informed about the IUD; what are the common&#13;
myths and misconceptions about the IUD; and what are the common myths&#13;
and misconceptions about other methods.&#13;
24.         On the basis of results from this study, model approaches, protocols and&#13;
interventions would be developed and tested to improve IUD acceptability and service&#13;
quality: for example, through standardization of state-of-the-art IUD insertion and&#13;
removal techniques, follow-up care and RTI treatment; fine-tuning of selection and&#13;
screening criteria for IUD use; corresponding refresher training and improved pre-service&#13;
training; better supervision of providers; provision of appropriate IEC materials and&#13;
programs, etc.&#13;
B.    Evaluation of Pregnancy Termination Services&#13;
25.           Pregnancy termination has been made widely available in Viet Nam with&#13;
the intention of providing safe back-up services in the event of contraceptive failure.&#13;
Current levels of menstrual regulation and abortion are however much above expected&#13;
back-up needs in a situation of widespread access to modern contraception and need to be&#13;
&#13;

reduced. Again, a number of clinical studies on this subject have been carried out, but&#13;
there is still a need for an assessment of the causes and program implications of the current&#13;
high termination rates. Therefore a national study will be conducted using both&#13;
institutional-level and community-level data. Its aims will be to establish the level of&#13;
pregnancy termination, to determine the reasons for seeking pregnancy termination, and&#13;
the consequences of current levels and patterns of termination. The study will be&#13;
composed of three parts, as follows:&#13;
(a)   Study of Service Records: From a representative sample of termination&#13;
client records, the following data will be collected: demographic&#13;
characteristics of women seeking termination; reasons for opting for&#13;
termination; contraceptive history. A sample of clients would also be&#13;
intervievved on: their experience of the procedure; the quality of services&#13;
received, including pre-termination and post-termination counselling; their&#13;
attitudes to termination and other birth control methods; and their&#13;
subsequent reproductive and contraceptive histories.&#13;
(b)   Study of Service Providers: A sample of providers will be surveyed on&#13;
aspects of service quality at all levels of facility where terminations are&#13;
done, including questions on: what kind of pre-termination and post-&#13;
termination counselling they offer, with particular attention to minimizing&#13;
or preventing repeat abortions through appropriate contraception; their&#13;
training and skill levels in termination techniques; schedules of follow-up&#13;
care; treatment of RTIs; and main complications and problems&#13;
encountered. In addition, focus-group discussions with groups of providers&#13;
would be conducted to elicit in depth their attitudes and beliefs about&#13;
termination in an informal setting.&#13;
(c)   Study of Community Attitudes and Practices: The community study&#13;
will include both a sample survey of married women and wide-ranging&#13;
focus-group discussions with unselected groups of community women. The&#13;
sample survey would aim to collect reliable data on the incidence and&#13;
patterns of pregnancy termination, including service location and cost of&#13;
the procedure to the client (this latter to be supplemented also by data from&#13;
MOH on the cost of providing the service). The focus-group discussions&#13;
would explore community perceptions of and attitudes to pregnancy&#13;
termination.&#13;
26.          On the basis of results from this study, model approaches, protocols and&#13;
interventions would be developed and tested to reduce levels of pregnancy terminati n&#13;
and improve service quality: for example, in addition to improved access to a wide ra ge&#13;

of modem contraceptive methods, through standardization of state-of-the-art MR. and&#13;
abortion techniques, follow-up care and RTI treatment; fine-tuning of selection and&#13;
screening criteria for MRs; improved pre-termination and post-termination counselling&#13;
with emphasis on ensuring protection from a further unwanted pregnancy through&#13;
immediate contraceptive counselling and supply; corresponding refresher training and&#13;
improved pre-service training; better supervision of providers; provision of appropriate&#13;
[EC materials and programs, etc.&#13;
C.    Evaluation of RTI Services&#13;
27.         Although RTIs are universally acknowledged to be a major reproductive&#13;
health problem in Viet Nam, there is a severe lack of data on RTI incidence, prevalence,&#13;
patterns and causes. The first step in any attempt to reduce RTI levels must therefore be&#13;
data collection. A three-part study will be conducted in selected districts, representing a&#13;
variety of living conditions and cultures, to establish the exact extent and nature of the&#13;
RTI problem. Again, both institutional and community-level data will be collected, as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   Study of Service Records: Client records from a sample of facilities at all&#13;
levels of care will be examined to gain a preliminary idea of the extent of&#13;
the problenm, as well as associated, pre-disposing and causal factors (with&#13;
particular attention to associations with the IUD and pregnancy&#13;
termination), and treatment given. A sample of clients would be surveyed&#13;
to provide corresponding information.&#13;
(b)   Study of Service Providers: A sample of providers will be surveyed on&#13;
aspects of service quality, including questions on: management protocols&#13;
followed for RTI diagnosis and treatment, with attention to management of&#13;
concurrent IUD or termination care; their training and skill levels in&#13;
diagnosis and treatment; schedules of follow-up care; and main&#13;
complications and problems encountered. In addition, focus-group&#13;
discussions with groups of providers would be conducted to elicit in depth&#13;
their attitudes and beliefs about RTIs in an informal setting.&#13;
(c)   Study of Community Attitudes and Practices: The community study&#13;
will include both a sample survey of married women and wide-ranging&#13;
focus-group discussions with unselected groups of community women. The&#13;
sample survey would aim to collect reliable data on the incidence and&#13;
patterns of RTIs, including associations with rUD and termination and their&#13;
experience of treatment at health facilities. The focus-group discussions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-141-                            Annex 11&#13;
would explore community perceptions of and knowledge about the&#13;
determinants of RTIs and the problems associated with them.&#13;
28.          On the basis of results from this study, model approaches, protocols and&#13;
interventions would be developed and tested to reduce the prevalence of RTIs and&#13;
improve service quality: for example, through development of preventive strategies;&#13;
standardization of protocols for state-of-the-art RTI diagnosis and treatment, and follow-&#13;
up care, including how to handle IUD use and termination; corresponding refresher&#13;
training and improved pre-service training; better supervision of providers; provision of&#13;
appropriate IEC materials and programs, etc.&#13;
29.          Strategies and Models for Minority Populations: The health post model&#13;
described above is one approach to the problem of improving access to good-quality and&#13;
appropriate family health services for disadvantaged ethnic minorities. However an overall&#13;
set of strategies and approaches needs to be developed. Other model interventions will be&#13;
developed and tested on the basis of sound base data and informed participation by&#13;
minority communities. Special participative baseline studies will be carried out, and a&#13;
variety of models and strategies will be piloted and evaluated. These might include special&#13;
incentive programs to attract private and NGO providers to minority areas and special&#13;
training programs for traditional midwives and healers. Overall evaluative studies will also&#13;
be carried out at the end of the project.&#13;

PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
1.          NCPFP set up a national level Project Steering Committee (PSC) and&#13;
Project Unit (PU) in January 1994. In addition, provincial level project units were also&#13;
established in the five first-phase provinces. The PSC and PU worked closely with the&#13;
Bank missions in project preparation and design, thus initiating the project management&#13;
structure at an early stage.&#13;
B.    Organization&#13;
2.    The central project management organization will have three layers:&#13;
*  a Ministerial level--Project Steering Committee (PSC);&#13;
* a Director level-- Executive Comrnittee (EC); and&#13;
* a working level--Project Management Unit (PMU).&#13;
3.           The SC will be chaired by the Chairman of the NCPFP, and its members&#13;
will consist of the Vice-Ministers of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (WPI),&#13;
Ministry of Finance (MOF), State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) and Ministry of Health&#13;
(MOH). The EC will be composed of the eight department directors of NCPFP. In&#13;
addition, a Director will be assigned as a standing member of EC and will serve as full-&#13;
time Project Director.&#13;

-152 -                          Annex 13&#13;
4.           Under the Director, the PMU will have 15 staff, who will be assigned to&#13;
nine sections (the eighlt functional sections plus general adminstration). In addition, the&#13;
PMU will hire local consultants as needed to form task forces to assist project&#13;
management in special areas. These task forces will work directly under the leadership of&#13;
the central Project Director. The key staff positions identified in the NCPFP Project&#13;
Management Unit are those of Director, Task Manager, Lead Civil Works Officer, Lead&#13;
Procurement Officer And Lead Disbursement Officer. In the 15 project provinces,&#13;
provincial PUs will be established and which will consist of a Manager and three staff.&#13;

C.    Functions &amp; Operation&#13;
5.           The Steering Committee will be the highest level of decision-making&#13;
during project implementation. It will meet regularly every three months to discuss&#13;
various aspects of project supervision, and to make decisions on relevant policies and&#13;
strategies for proper project implementation. The main function of the SC will be to&#13;
foster coordination am.ong NCPFP and the other relevant agencies namely, MPI, MOF,&#13;
SBV, and MOH.&#13;
6.           The Executive Committee will play an important role in mobilizing the&#13;
policy and technical resources within NCPFP by involving the line departments in project&#13;
implementation. Each department would be assigned one component/sub-component, for&#13;
example, the IEC Department will be responsible for the dEC component, and the Family&#13;
Planning Coordination Department will be responsible forcthe  family health service&#13;
delivery component. Each Department will then be responsible for ensuring that the&#13;
project fits into the overall plan to meet national objectives and resolve any conflicts that&#13;
may arise between project and program goals and objectives. The EC will therefore meet&#13;
every month to review implementation during the course of the project.&#13;
7.           The horizontal coordination among all the line departments will be the&#13;
responsibility of the Project Director and the Project Management Unit under his&#13;
leadership. The PMU will prepare the annual working plan and progress report for review&#13;

-153 -                         Annex 13&#13;
by the SC and EC, prior to submission to the World Bank. The PMU will also conduct&#13;
the procurement of equipment and drugs, and maintain project accounts. The central&#13;
PMU will provide implementation guidance to provincial project management units.&#13;

-154-                                Annex 14&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING, EVALUATION AND SUPERVISION&#13;
1.           Projects in the social sectors are often plagued by a lack of reliable baseline data as&#13;
well as weak monitoring and evaluation systems. Bank projects, in particular, have traditionally&#13;
focused on project inputs and accountability issues, rather than on project outputs and impact&#13;
indicators in terms of reductions in fertility, improvements in health status for individuals, or the&#13;
performance of the health services. This makes it impossible to assess the impact of the proposed&#13;
interventions on the population.&#13;
Current Status of Population and Demographic Statistics in Viet Nam&#13;
2.           The Government of Viet Nam has become increasingly aware of the need for&#13;
regular and reliable population and demographic statistics for formulating and monitoring its&#13;
population policies and for other development planning purposes. Two population and housing&#13;
censuses (in 1979 and in 1989) have been conducted since reunification in 1975. Another census&#13;
is planned for 1999. These censuses contain information on childbearing, childhood and adult&#13;
mortality, and other key indicators that we have selected for measuring the progress of the&#13;
project. Disaggregation to the province level and for specific sub-groups (ethnic minorities,&#13;
married women of reproductive age, etc.) of the population is possible for some of the indicators.&#13;
3.           The General Statistics Office (GSO) also prepares a time series of national and&#13;
sub-national population and demographic estimates for use by the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Investment and other agencies. However, the range and detail of the estimates it currently&#13;
prepares is very limited, and is insufficient to meet the needs of the Population and Family Health&#13;
Project.&#13;
4.           Civil registration of births and deaths, which has its legal origins in a government&#13;
directive in 1961, takes place at the commune level. It is widely recognized, however, that there&#13;
is very severe under-registration of births and deaths, particularly in rural areas, as well as&#13;
frequently delayed registration. Registrars are unsure about their registration duties, and are&#13;
hampered by lack of training, lack of materials, and lack of incentive to perform these duties.&#13;
Large Survey Efforts&#13;
5.           The Viet Nam Demographic and Health Survey (VNDHS) was carried out in&#13;
1988, the first such assessment of demographic and health status since the implementation of&#13;
population and family planning programs in the early 1 960s. The nationally-representative sample&#13;
survey was carried out by the National Committee for Population and Family Planning (NCPFP),&#13;
with financial support from UNFPA. A total of 4,807 households and 4,172 eligible women aged&#13;
15 to 49 years old were interviewed to collect data on fertility, family planning, and a few&#13;
indicators of child and maternal health.&#13;

6.           A second demographic survey was carried out more recently in 1994 by the&#13;
General Statistical Office (GSO), with financial support from UNFPA. The survey, the Vietnam&#13;
1994 Intercensal Demographic Survey, was conducted in order to update information on human&#13;
reproduction, infant and child mortality, contraceptive use, and maternal and child care. More&#13;
than 13,000 households and 10,490 ever-married women between the ages of 15 and 50 were&#13;
interviewed. Estimates are representative of the population at three levels: national, urban/rural,&#13;
and for seven geographical regions.&#13;
Status of Family Planning and Family Health Service Statistics&#13;
7.           Family planning and facility-related health statistics are also routinely collected at&#13;
various levels of the Vietnamese system. The organization and control of data collection and&#13;
compilation are highly decentralized and have their roots in some 10,000 communes, the lowest&#13;
level of administrative units Two streams of data processing occur in the system, which can be&#13;
simplified as follows. Firs1, the commune family-planning collaborator reports information on&#13;
acceptors, method mix, and other factors to the Commune Population and Family Planning Board&#13;
(CPFPB), where it is summarized and then sent in turn to the District (DCPFP), to the Province&#13;
(PCPFP), and to the National level (NCPFP). Second, the commune family-planning collaborator&#13;
reports the same information to the Commune Health Center (CHC), where it is combined with&#13;
other information on CHC ifacility usage (for family planning as well as other health concerns).&#13;
Data from mobile team efforts are also incorporated. These reports are compiled and sent in turn&#13;
to the district health services (DHS), provincial health bureau (PHB), and National (MOH) levels.&#13;
At the appropriate levels, infbrmation on services provided at polyclinics, provincial hospitals, and&#13;
other facilities is added in.&#13;
8.           A number of problems are evident with this system. The foundation of the data&#13;
collection system is the collaborator or CHC-level worker. Collaborators are generally unpaid&#13;
volunteers, with low or no levels of basic training and frequently only low levels of basic skills.&#13;
The CHC-level workers, while of higher qualification than the collaborators, are often lacking the&#13;
basic skills that are required for data collection and reporting.&#13;
9.           System inefficiencies are evident throughout the country. Data are almost entirely&#13;
manually compiled and processed at all stages, increasing the probability of introducing bias into&#13;
the statistics. Furthermore, since workers in both the NCPFP and the MOH stream are compiling&#13;
family-planning information, there is a duplication of effort. Given these constraints and in the&#13;
absence of a thorough evaluation of the service statistics, the data are of unknown but&#13;
questionable quality.&#13;
Evaluation of the Viet Nam Population and Family Health Project&#13;
10.         Given this background, the Viet Nam Population and Farnily Health Project will&#13;
implement four basic strategies to monitor and evaluate the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-156 -                               Annex 14&#13;
Namely,&#13;
(a)    Conduct of three major surveys (baseline, mid-term review, and final evaluation)&#13;
for the purposes of project evaluation, particularly to measure the project impact&#13;
indicators which have been selected for the project.&#13;
(b)   Conduct of three major studies (baseline, mid-term review, and final evaluation)&#13;
also for the purposes of project evaluation. These studies will measure indicators&#13;
of project impact for components of family planning and family health that cannot&#13;
be readily measured using a population-based survey sample. These studies will&#13;
mostly require evaluation of particular components based on facility records.&#13;
(c)    Conduct of special surveys and studies to evaluate the special needs and&#13;
appropriate strategies for meeting those needs for the major ethnic minority&#13;
populations.&#13;
(d)   Management Information System (MIS) efforts. This will include strengthening&#13;
the use of computers for data gathering and analysis at national and provincial&#13;
levels, strengthening of managers' capacity for using information for planning,&#13;
prioritizing and monitoring population and family planning activities through&#13;
training availability of necessary resources at levels.&#13;
11.          The data sources which will be utilized to calculate a full matrix of input,&#13;
intermediate, and impact indicators have been selected for the Viet Nam Population and Family&#13;
Health Project for national, provincial, and lower levels. Within this matrix, ten key indicators&#13;
have been selected to measure project impact and achievement. In general, most of the key&#13;
indicators can be calculated from special surveys that have been planned at three points in the&#13;
project cycle. A few will require conduct of specialized studies of routinely-collected information&#13;
that is available from CHC's and from family planning workers. Strengthening of the MIS efforts&#13;
will facilitate this task.&#13;
Project Surveys&#13;
12.          Three major surveys will be implemented as part of the Viet Nam Population and&#13;
Family Health Project at various times in the project cycle. The first, to be conducted before&#13;
project activities begin, will provide baseline data. A mid-term review will occur towards the&#13;
middle of the project. A final evaluation of the project will be conducted at completion of the&#13;
project. The World Bank requires conduct of these three surveys as part of its agreement with the&#13;
Government of Viet Nam. The National Committee for Population and Family Planning (or an&#13;
agent thereof) will be responsible for the overall implementation of the survey, including sample&#13;
design, preparation of survey instruments, testing, training, field work, data processing, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-157 -                              Annex 14&#13;
analysis. A written report on the major findings for each of the key indicators is required for each&#13;
of the surveys.&#13;
13.         All three surveys will be national-level, population-based sample surveys. Over-&#13;
sampling of the ethnic minoriity populations in the 15 Project provinces will be carried out. These&#13;
surveys will assess the family planning and family health status of the population, with particular&#13;
emphasis on the ten key indicators that have been selected for the Project.&#13;
14.         In addition to collecting data in order to calculate the key indicators, special&#13;
supplements to the three data collection efforts should address particular components of the&#13;
project. For instance, a module on knowledge, attitudes, and practice of contraception would&#13;
help to monitor and evaluate the IEC component of the project. A module on service delivery&#13;
would address whether contraceptives that are procured by the project ultimately reach women in&#13;
the villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
At a bare minimum, the questionnaire must be designed such that the following data are collected&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -                             Annex 14&#13;
Special Studies&#13;
15.         A few of the key indicators cannot be based on a population-based survey, and will&#13;
require the conduct of special studies. Two of the studies will require analysis of facility records&#13;
in order to calculate the key indicators: (1) met need for life-saving obstetric care, and, (2)&#13;
proportion of one-year-olds who were fully immunized as infants. For these two studies, sections&#13;
emphasizing the characteristlics of the major ethnic minority populations will be included. A third&#13;
indicator, the management information score, will investigate whether 18 items of data which is&#13;
relevant for management is available at the central offices of the National Committee for&#13;
Population and Family Planning.&#13;
16.         The special studies will be conducted at three time points during the project cycle:&#13;
baseline, mid-term, and finaLl evaluation. The National Committee for Population and Family&#13;
Planning (or an agent thereof) will be responsible for the overall implementation of the studies,&#13;
including study design, preparation of reporting instruments, training, field work, data compilation&#13;
and processing, and analysis. A written report on the major findings for each of the key indicators&#13;
is required for each of the studies.&#13;
Special Surveys and Studiies to Address the Population and Family Health Needs of the&#13;
Major Ethnic Minority Polpulations&#13;
17.         With the exception of the Han, all of the major ethnic groups in Viet Nam are&#13;
known to be demographically disadvantaged relative to the Kinh, with higher rates of both fertility&#13;
and infant mortality. Little information exists, however, to understand the underlying reasons for&#13;
their disadvantage.&#13;
18.         The ten major ethnic minority populations will be over-sampled in the survey&#13;
instruments and special studies that have already been described to calculate the key indicators.&#13;
Additional participatory studies, to be conducted among each of the ten groups, will address their&#13;
special population and family health needs. These assessments will be conducted using focus-&#13;
group methodology among various sub-groups of the ethnic minority populations, including&#13;
women of reproductive age, men of reproductive age, adolescents, grand-mothers, traditional&#13;
birth attendants or others found to be important to decision-making processes in family health.&#13;
19.         Topics to be addressed will include, but are not limited to, the following issues:&#13;
(a)   Beneficiary-needs assessments: These special studies will allow members of the&#13;
ethnic minorilties to communicate what population and family health needs they&#13;
have that could reasonably be expected to be fulfilled during the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-160 -                              Annex 14&#13;
(b)   Knowledge,, attitudes, and practice of family planning:   Contradictory&#13;
impressions exist regarding the acceptability of family planning services in Viet&#13;
Nam. The iCommittee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas (CEMMA)&#13;
suggests that the issue of family planning can be sensitive to certain ethnic groups&#13;
since they do not want to adopt any practice that may jeopardize their cultural&#13;
identity and preservation as a distinct ethnic group.  In contrast, preliminary&#13;
studies suggest that non-use may simply reflect lack of accessibility and poor&#13;
method mix.&#13;
(c)    Care during pregnancy and delivery: In order to gain a fuller understanding of&#13;
pregnancy- and delivery-care, special focus group studies should be conducted&#13;
with pregnant women, new mothers, traditional birth attendants, and relevant&#13;
family members. Questions should solicit information on the dietary practices of&#13;
pregnant ancl breastfeeding women, supplementation (if any) with vitamins, work&#13;
habits, traditional practices and beliefs, practices in the event of an obstetric&#13;
emergency, transportation options, etc.&#13;
(d)   Family healith care:  Suggested topics for this component include traditional&#13;
practices for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases (including&#13;
malaria), imrnunization practices, the use of traditional healers, and the reasons for&#13;
non-use of CHCs.&#13;
Management Information System&#13;
20.          An information system will be developed to support strategic planning activities at&#13;
national and provincial levels, operational activities at commune level and a coordinating function&#13;
at the district level. In order to achieve this, the project would support hardware and software at&#13;
national and provincial levels, training in appropriate MIS skills for staff at commune, district,&#13;
provincial, and national levels, and foreign and local technical assistance for setting up the MIS.&#13;
Given that the development of the MIS system is at an early stage, calculation of the key&#13;
indicators will not be dependent upon the system.&#13;
Supervision Reporting and Arrangements&#13;
Supervision Reports&#13;
21.          The Project Management Unit in NCPFP will submit six-monthly progress reports&#13;
to IDA, beginning six months after the date of effectiveness and every six months thereafter. An&#13;
indicative outline of the structure and contents of the report format follows; the full detailed&#13;
format, including dummy tables, will be prepared by the PMU prior to the first IDA supervision&#13;

Supervision Arran2ements&#13;
22.          Supervision missions will normally be scheduled to take place at six-monthly&#13;
intervals, beginning with the project launch mission shortly after effectiveness. To the extent&#13;
possible, they would be coordinated to coincide with the production of the six-monthly progress&#13;
reports. Every effort would be made to coordinate mission timing with ADB and KfW supervision&#13;
visits, so that joint supervision would be maximised. Additional supervision missions would be&#13;
scheduled to resolve any special issues or needs.&#13;
23           The core staffing of regular supervision mission would normally comprise:&#13;
the Task Manager&#13;
a public healith or family planning specialist&#13;
an architect (for the first half of the project)&#13;
To these would be added fi-om time to time, as needed or convenient, specialists as follows:&#13;
-     training&#13;
-      lEC&#13;
-     MIS&#13;
-     management&#13;
-     logistics/pharmaceuticals&#13;
-     monitoring/evaluation/data collection&#13;
-     ethnic minority issues&#13;
-     economics/Financial matters&#13;
-     procuremernt&#13;
-     disbursement/flows of funds/audits&#13;
-     social marketing&#13;
-     any other specialities required&#13;
The initial aim would be to have a supervision mission from each type of specialist at least once&#13;
during the first half of the project. Priorities for the second half of the project would be reviewed&#13;
after the project Mid-term Review. A full dated indicative supervision mission plan follows:&#13;

SPECLUL STRATEGIES FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES&#13;
1.          The Demography of Ethnic Minorities in Viet Nam: The major source&#13;
of data on the demography of ethnic minorities in Viet Nam is the 1989 census. Tables&#13;
A. 16.1 and A. 16.2 and Map No. IBRD 27338 summarise a few key features, including the&#13;
percentage of ethnic minorities in each province and the total population, estimated total&#13;
fertility rate and estimated infant mortality rate for the major ethnic groups in 1989.&#13;

2.          There is huge variation by province in the proportion of ethnic minority&#13;
groups among total provincial populations. Broadly speaking, the non-Kinh groups form&#13;
only a small minority in most lowland and delta provinces, but make up 50-80 percent of&#13;
the population in mountainous provinces. Several provinces have been subdivided since&#13;
1989, so estimation for those affected is difficult, but roughly speaking, ethnic minorities&#13;
constitute 50-80 percent of the population in three of the 15 provinces covered under&#13;
Component I of the project (Lau Cai, Lai Chau, Tuyen Quang, all in the northern&#13;
highlands), 15-30 percent in another six (Bac Thai, Dac Lac, Lam Dong, Kien Giang, Tra&#13;
Vinh, Thanh Hoa, almost all including mountainous regions), and less than four percent in&#13;
the remaining six (Hai Hung, Hai Phong, Nam Ha, Thua Thien Hue, Dong Thap, Vinh&#13;
Long, all delta or coastal).&#13;

- 172-                           Annex 15&#13;
3.           Clearly all the ethnic minority groups except the Han are demographically&#13;
disadvantaged relative to the Kinh, with higher fertility and infant mortality. The Tay and&#13;
the Muong are not too far behind in either respect, but the other groups all show TFRs of&#13;
over 5 and IMRs 20 to 70 points higher. The H'mong, the Gia-rai and the Dao stand out&#13;
as particularly disadvantaged in either or both fertility and infant mortality levels.&#13;
4.           Findings; of the Baseline Survey Exercise:  Most ethnic groups are&#13;
known from census and survey data to be poor, ill-educated and isolated. It is therefore&#13;
hardly surprising that thieir demographic profile is unfavourable. However the proximate&#13;
determinants of their fertility and mortality levels and patterns have been little studied. A&#13;
first step in the design of any special strategy is therefore a set of baseline surveys and&#13;
participative baseline studies (see Annex 14). A model exercise of this kind was conducted&#13;
as part of project preparation in Dac Lac province.&#13;
5.           The major findings of the participative studies conducted in Dac Lac&#13;
among a number of minority groups were as follows:&#13;
(a)   family planning, modem contraception and modern health care appear to be&#13;
very acceptable to minority women, couples and communities&#13;
(b)   Government and health workers are not always in touch with community&#13;
attitudes and interests in the health and family planning sectors and&#13;
communications between program staff and communities need to be&#13;
improved&#13;
(c)   there is considerable unsatisfied demand for temporary methods of&#13;
contraception in many minority communities, particularly pills and&#13;
injectables&#13;
(d)   health facilities in minority areas were often dilapidated and poorly&#13;
equipped and supplied&#13;
(e)   there is a severe deficiency of good-quality IEC materials and activities in&#13;
minority communes&#13;
(f)   there is a large reservoir of interested and motivated minority community&#13;
members who could be tapped for extension, outreach or community-based&#13;
distribution work for family planning and health&#13;
(g)   there is a need for refresher training for health and FP staff, particularly for&#13;
family planning, with emphasis on counselling skills and up-to-date&#13;
knowledge of modern contraceptive methods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-173 -                          Annex 15&#13;
(h)   there is a need to develop new and specialised approaches to the provision&#13;
of healt]h and family planning services in minority areas, with the emphasis&#13;
on recnritment and specialised training programs for minority community-&#13;
based workers.&#13;
6.          In line with the above, field observations in Lau Cai during project&#13;
preparation identified the following major problems in the delivery of primary health care&#13;
and family planning in remote mountainous areas:&#13;
(a)   long travel distances between villages and CHCs, resulting in low&#13;
utilisation of CHCs and heavy dependence on DHC mobile teams to&#13;
provide services&#13;
(b)   serious understaffling of CHCs, with many empty facilities used only as&#13;
premises for visiting DHC teams&#13;
(c)   serious shortages of minority health workers, due to low educational levels&#13;
among rninority groups&#13;
(d)   low skill levels among minority health workers, for the same reason&#13;
7.           Outline of a Special Strategy for Health and FP Service Delivery in&#13;
Remote Minority Areas: Based on the above findings, plus available information from&#13;
other sources, the outline of a set of special strategies for delivery of health and family&#13;
planning services in minority areas that are remote and mountainous, and hence isolated&#13;
and underserved at the present moment, has been developed for introduction and testing&#13;
under the project. Details will be refined on the basis of the full findings from the baseline&#13;
surveys and studies to be conducted as a first step, but a preliminary set of possible&#13;
interventions has been identified. Its principal approach is to adapt the standard Viet Nam&#13;
model of service delivery to the special needs of remote areas and minority cultures by&#13;
upgrading, strengthening and expanding outreach, access and community-level or&#13;
community-based services and promotive activities. Major features are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Adaptation of the CHC Model for Remote Mountainous Areas: Since&#13;
larger in-patient CHC facilities which can do deliveries will not be utilised&#13;
in remote mountainous areas, only small outpatient facilities will be&#13;
provided in such areas under Component I of the project (as well as under&#13;
the National Health Support Project).&#13;
(b)   Establishment of Health Posts: A model health post system would be&#13;
tested under Component 5 in 60 communes in remote mountainous areas in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-174 -                          Annex 15&#13;
the 15 project provinces, and expanded under Component I to all such&#13;
areas in the 15 project provinces if successful. For a commune to be&#13;
eligible for coverage by the system, it must fulfil the following criteria:&#13;
(i)   the CHC must have at least 3 health staff&#13;
(ii)  the CHC must be at least 4 hours walking distance from the&#13;
nearest DHC&#13;
(iii)  there must be strong commitment from the Provincial&#13;
People's Committee&#13;
A health post would be set up in one village in each commune. It would&#13;
consist of two small rooms, one of which would be a consultation&#13;
room/office and the other a bedroom. Basic furniture, medical equipment, a&#13;
selection of essential drugs, and a bicycle for household visiting would be&#13;
supplied. The health post would be staffed by one of the CHC health&#13;
workers, on either a rotational basis or as a permanent assignment,&#13;
according to the choice of the workers. The health worker in residence&#13;
would provide basic IEC and services for MCH/FP, including the&#13;
distribution of appropriate contraceptives and some minor curative care. In&#13;
the separate new collaborator (family health worker) system to be also&#13;
tested (see below) the health post could be staffed by the new family health&#13;
worker.&#13;
(c)   Establishment of Family Health Workers: Remote mountainous areas&#13;
and minority areas would participate in the new collaborator (renamed&#13;
family health worker) model system to be tested under Component 5 and&#13;
extended to cover the 15 project provinces if successful under Component&#13;
1; out of the total 45 communes selected for testing, 22 would be in remote&#13;
mountainous areas and another 5 in midland and mountainous areas that&#13;
are not considered remote. In remote areas, 7 full-time family health&#13;
workers would be recruited per commune (compared to 3 in delta&#13;
communes and 5 in the midland/mountainous areas) and each would be&#13;
given a bicycle to facilitate household visiting. If both the health post and&#13;
the family health worker systems are successful, the health posts could be&#13;
staffed by family health workers as an alternative to CHC staff.&#13;
(d)   Additional Transport for DHC Outreach: Under Component 1, DHCs&#13;
in remote mountainous areas would be provided with extra motorcycles&#13;
(and in thie Mekong delta, motor boats) in order to enhance their outreach&#13;
capabilities. The vehicles would be used by the DHC mobile teams for EPI,&#13;
FP and control of endemic diseases. The project would also finance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-175 -                          Annex 15&#13;
maintenance and operating costs for the vehicles. The impact of this&#13;
additional transport would be evaluated at the end of the project and&#13;
continued under regular health/FP budgets if judged essential to full&#13;
functioning of the DHC mobile teams.&#13;
(e)   Special Training Strategy for Remote Mountainous Areas: Because of&#13;
the lack of local minority candidates with adequate minimum educational&#13;
qualificaltions (completion of high school), health staff in these areas are at&#13;
least 80 percent Kinh. Even so, there is an acute shortage of CHC health&#13;
workers, with more than 50 percent of the approximately 500 communes in&#13;
the remcte mountainous areas of the 15 project provinces currently lacking&#13;
any resident CHC staff. Such CHCs must be staffed by a seconded DHC&#13;
worker. Skills of minority health workers, where they exist, also often need&#13;
improveiment. Thus special strategies for pre-service and in-service training&#13;
will be implemented in the 15 project provinces in order to both increase&#13;
minority worker numbers and upgrade skills of existing minority staff, as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(i)   Pre-Service Special Training: About 300 minority health workers&#13;
with below-standard educational qualifications would be recruited&#13;
and employed by the local CPFPB, and trained as "family health&#13;
workers" to serve in CHCs. They would receive a short basic on-&#13;
the-job training course of about one month at the local DCH, plus&#13;
two supplementary courses of the same length to follow later once&#13;
the workers were in service. In addition, they would receive in-&#13;
service refresher training of 2 days every 4 months at the local&#13;
DHC. Those who showed promise could later take the regular&#13;
primary midwife pre-service course at the provincial secondary&#13;
medical school and then be upgraded to the level of primary&#13;
midwife.&#13;
(ii)   In-Service Special Training: Frequent refresher training would be&#13;
provided to the approximately 500 minority workers stationed in&#13;
'CHCs in the remote mountainous areas, in order to upgrade and&#13;
maintain their skills. The training schedule would comprise four&#13;
short courses per year of about two days each at the local DHC.&#13;
(iii)  Special Training Methodologies: All the in-service and pre-&#13;
service training described above would take place at the DHC in&#13;
order to facilitate attendance. DHCs would be provided with the&#13;
necessary teaching aids. Training methodology and materials would&#13;
be adapted to lower educational levels through: an emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176-                          Annex 15&#13;
practical skills and demonstration models; heavy use of pictorial&#13;
materials; translation of training materials into local minority&#13;
languages; and special training of DHC trainers in the use of these&#13;
special methodologies and materials.&#13;
A reference manual adapted to this modified training approach will be&#13;
developed and provided to all minority CHC workers (including family&#13;
planning workers) in remote mountainous areas throughout the country,&#13;
except for the National Health Support Project provinces where it would&#13;
be provided under that project's financing.&#13;
(g)   Special Family Planning Approach for Minority Groups: The project&#13;
as a whole responds to the findings above through support of increased&#13;
access to and promotion of modem temporary methods such as pills and&#13;
injectables, as well as improved models of IUD. However, special&#13;
approaches will be designed and implemented to adapt family planning&#13;
services to the particular conditions, needs and preferences of minority&#13;
communities. This will be done after the results of the baseline surveys and&#13;
studies are available for guidance, and will be based on them. It is expected&#13;
that these special approaches will include:&#13;
(i)   emphasis on promotion and provision of modem  temporary&#13;
methods&#13;
(ii)   custom-designed and high-quality IEC programs and materials for&#13;
at least the largest minority groups&#13;
(iii)  particular attention to counselling, community participation and&#13;
community-based activities and programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS&#13;
A.    Estimated Project Costs&#13;
1     .      Estimated base costs for the project amount to around US$110 million and&#13;
total costs to around IJS$130 million. Recurrent costs in the project budget make up&#13;
about US$14 million (11 percent) of the project budget, or an annual amount of around&#13;
US$2 million. However some of these recurrent costs are tied to specific investments or&#13;
activities limited to the project period (such as travel, supplies and communications costs&#13;
for project management and the refresher training part of the upgrading package for the 15&#13;
project provinces) and will not enter into the sustainability analysis. Conversely, some&#13;
project costs categorised as investment costs, namely drugs &amp; medical supplies and&#13;
contraceptive commodities, will in fact require sustaining after the life of the project.&#13;
Allowances for commtnity-based outreach workers (family health workers) in the 15&#13;
project provinces, under the strengthened collaborator system to be first piloted in the&#13;
initial 2 years of the project under funding from Component 5, are not included in this&#13;
category, since the success of the pilot, and hence the need to provide these allowances,&#13;
are quite uncertain at this point.&#13;
2.           The costs that will be taken account of in this analysis are:&#13;
(a)    maintenance costs for facilities upgraded and equipment purchased&#13;
under the project, amounting to an average annual sum of&#13;
uS$900,000&#13;
(b)   annual essential drug &amp; medical supplies, amounting to an average&#13;
annual sum of US$ 2.1 million for the 15 project provinces&#13;
(c)   logistics costs for essential drug &amp; medical supplies, calciulated as&#13;
7.5 percent of the costs of the commodities&#13;
(d)   annual contraceptive commodity supplies, excluding condoms (see&#13;
below for estimated costs from various aspects&#13;
(e)   logistics costs for contraceptive supplies, calculated as 7.5 percent&#13;
of the costs of the commodities&#13;
3.           Of total, maintenance costs, half will be held against the national health&#13;
budget and half against the national population/FP budget, on the assumption that a large&#13;
proportion of services provided by the facilities are related to family planning, and that this&#13;
will be reflected in some manner in the annual responsibility contracts made by NCPFP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178-                           Annex 16&#13;
with the health system to deliver FP services. Drug &amp; medical supplies costs, with&#13;
accompanying logistics costs, will be held against the national health budget; and&#13;
contraceptive commodity costs, with accompanying logistics costs, will be held against the&#13;
national population/FP budget.&#13;
4.          National Contraceptives  Supply: Total costs  for contraceptive&#13;
commodities are to be financed under the project for the four years 1997-2002. These&#13;
commodities exclude condoms but are otherwise projected to cover 100 percent of the&#13;
country's needs for those years. A small reserve fund for emergency needs in the last years&#13;
of the project is also included. The total including logistics costs comes to around US$25&#13;
million.&#13;
5.          Total annual national costs for contraceptive commodities, excluding&#13;
condoms, are projected to rise during the life of the project from a current level of around&#13;
US$3 million to around US$7.5 million in 2002 ( including logistics costs). This rise is&#13;
expected to occur through a combination of increasing contraceptive prevalence rates,&#13;
higher percentages of users relying on more commodity-intensive short-term methods such&#13;
as the pill and injectables., and growing numbers of women of reproductive age due to past&#13;
high population growth. The project is assumed to contribute heavily to the first two of&#13;
these three trends. Thus it would be fair -- and conservative for the purposes of this&#13;
analysis -- to consider the increase of US$4.5 million in annual contraceptive costs&#13;
(including logistics) as the recurrent cost burden generated by the project.&#13;
6.          Drug andl Medical Supplies for the 15 Project Provinces: Total costs of&#13;
US$15 million have been budgeted under the project to finance essential drugs and&#13;
medical supplies for the 1 5 project provinces. This amounts to an annual recurrent cost of&#13;
US$2.1 million which will have to be financed out of the regular health budget after the&#13;
project has closed. Addlitional logistics costs could amount to US$150,000, making a&#13;
total annual recurrent cost burden of US$2.25 million.&#13;
B.    Projected National Budgets&#13;
7.          Populatiorn/FP Budget: Domestic population/FP funding largely flows&#13;
through the national budget of the NCPFP, which in 1994 reached about 228 billion dong&#13;
or around US$23 million. Provincial budget funding amounted to about 23 billion dong, or&#13;
around 10 percent of central spending, though funding at lower levels is difficult to track.&#13;
Altogether, total Government spending on population and family planning in 1994 may&#13;
have amounted to somewhat over 251 billion dong, or US$25 million.&#13;
8.          According to NCPFP sources, the national budget in 1995 amounts to 245&#13;
billion dong (excluding spending on basic construction which is financed through another&#13;
channel). Projections for future years are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179-                           Annex 16&#13;
Year        Billions           Millions&#13;
of Dong           US$&#13;
1996         456               45.6&#13;
1997        467                46.7&#13;
1998        468                46.8&#13;
1999        488                48.8&#13;
2000         500               50.0&#13;
This projection indicates that after the 86 percent increase from 1995 to 1996, NCPFP's&#13;
budget would remain fairly static. It is based on the premise that spending on&#13;
population/FP should reach a level of US$0.6 by the year 2000, the goal which has been&#13;
approved by the Prime Minister. If the budget were to remain static in real terms, it might&#13;
increase to around US$58 million by the year 2002.&#13;
9.          According to MOH projections, the total national health budget for the&#13;
year 2002 will reach 12,625 billion dong, or US$1.26 billion. If a more conservative&#13;
projection is followed of an annual growth rate of only 8 percent, the 2002 health budget&#13;
would amount to 4,205 billion dong, or US$420 million. This more conservative&#13;
assumption will be adopted for this analysis.&#13;
C.    Recurrent Cost Implications&#13;
10.         Implications for the National Population/FP Budget: The annual&#13;
recurrent cost burden on the national population/FP budget generated by the project will&#13;
amount to around US$4.5 million for contraceptive commodities plus logistics costs.&#13;
Maintenance costs would add another US$ just under 450,000, making up US$5 million in&#13;
total. This would amount to about 8.5% of the projected population/FP budget for 2002,&#13;
a significant but sustainable amount.&#13;
11.         Taking a wider perspective, however, it makes sense to assess the entire&#13;
annual contraceptive coimmodity burden that would require to be financed at the end of&#13;
the project. As mentioned above, this is projected at US$7.5 million, exclulding condoms,&#13;
by 2002. Thus, contraceptive commodity and logistic costs alone would amount to&#13;
around 13 percent of the projected 2002 total budget.&#13;
12.         This scale of resource allocation for contraceptive supplies is not excessive&#13;
by the standards of family planning programs worldwide and therefore should be&#13;
sustainable by the Government of Viet Nam even if all these supplies were to be financed&#13;
by Government itself and provided free of charge through public programs. In fact, a&#13;
proportion of users already obtain their contraceptive supplies from the private sector and&#13;
the importance of bot:h the private sector and social marketing is likely to grow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-180 -                            Annex 16&#13;
substantially during the life of the project. A program of charges for public program users&#13;
is also planned to be introduced during the second half of the project. It is moreover very&#13;
likely that donor suppo:rt to contraceptive supplies would continue to be significant after&#13;
the year 2000, outside the umbrella of the project itself The sustainability of the expanded&#13;
contraceptive costs should therefore present no major problems.&#13;
13.         Implications for the National Health Budget: The annual recurrent cost&#13;
burden on the national health budget generated by the project will amount to around&#13;
US$2.7 million, made up of US$2.25 million for drugs and medical supplies, and&#13;
US$450,000 for maintenance. This would amount to 0.64 percent of a conservative&#13;
projection of the national health budget for 2002, which is a negligible amount.&#13;
14.         Incremental costs on this scale should not by themselves be difficult to&#13;
sustain. However, again it makes sense to adopt a broader perspective, and consider the&#13;
additional impact of the National Health Support Project and any further extension of&#13;
upgrading packages throughout the country. The National Health Support Project would&#13;
provide a similar upgrading package over the same period to another 15 provinces, raising&#13;
total coverage to more than half the country. However the two projects together would&#13;
still only raise incremental recurrent costs for the 30 provinces together to around US$5.4&#13;
million or less than 1.5 percent of the national health budget.&#13;
15.         Taking a still wider view, if the provincial upgrading package should&#13;
succeed in improving service quality and utilisation, Government might perhaps consider a&#13;
similar upgrading program in the country's remaining provinces. At most, however, the&#13;
additional recurrent cost burden from a similar investment program in the rest of the&#13;
country would about double that generated by the two projects. Thus annual costs of&#13;
essential drugs and maintenance of upgraded facilities and equipment for CHCs and DHCs&#13;
for the entire country would consume only around 3 percent of the national health budget.&#13;
It does not appear, therefore, that the upgrading of Viet Nam's PHC services could create&#13;
any major problem of sustainability.&#13;
&#13;

OUTLINE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION VOLUME&#13;
1.    The "Implementation Volume" is a follow-up document to the Staff Appraisal&#13;
Report. It is intended to serve as a detailed guide to day-to-day implementation of the&#13;
project and will be prepared in its final form by the NCPFP itself between negotiations and&#13;
project effectiveness. An "implementation volume" consists basically of a compilation of&#13;
all usefiul background maLterials put together in the course of project preparation, together&#13;
with a summary time-bound implementation plan for the entire project and detailed time-&#13;
bound annual implementation plans for at least the first year or two of activities. It is&#13;
better viewed not as a single document, but as a set of files containing all necessary&#13;
reference materials as well as a basic blueprint for implementation planning.&#13;
2.    What follows is an indicative outline of the contents of the Implementation&#13;
Volume, for use as a guide to its preparation.&#13;
The Summary Implementation Plan for the Project&#13;
3.    The core of this implementation plan would be a timetable of major project&#13;
activities, along the lines of a Gantt chart, Pert chart or Computerized Project&#13;
Management chart. For the summary plan, time need only be shown in blocks of months,&#13;
say quarters of a year, and activities in each component of the project can be summarized&#13;
in broad categories. This plan timetable should be kept permanently on the Project&#13;
Management Unit's computer system and updated continuously by management and MIS&#13;
staff. Print-outs could then be produced at regular intervals, say every six months, for&#13;
information and use by other project staff. To supplement the timetable, a text would be&#13;
added describing the major features of the plan, together with any notes needed on details&#13;
of its content.&#13;
4.    The Implementation Volume itself would contain only the first plan timetable and&#13;
text produced at the beginning of the project, which would set the format to be used. An&#13;
indicative example follows. The latest print-out would then be included in each six-&#13;
monthly progress report submitted to IDA (see Annex 14).&#13;
The Detailed Annual Implementation Plans&#13;
5.    The core of the annual implementation plan would be a set of timetables for each&#13;
year of the project, covering all activities planned under each component of the project,&#13;
again in the form of a Gaantt chart, Pert chart, Computerized Project Management chart&#13;
etc. Again, the timetables should be supplemented by as detailed a text as is necessary.&#13;
6.    For planning purposes, the timetables should be prepared at the end of each project&#13;
or fiscal year (whichever is more convenient) for rolling time-periods of two years, i.e., a&#13;
plan/timetable for the first two years should be prepared at the beginning of the project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-182 -                           Annex 17&#13;
then at the end of the first year, the plan/timetable for the second year should be revised in&#13;
the light of the achievements of the first year and a plan/timetable for the third year added;&#13;
then at the beginning of the third year the plan/timetable for the second year should be&#13;
revised and a plan/timetable for the fourth year added; and so on.&#13;
7.    Again, these plans/timetables should be permanently kept on the PMU computer&#13;
and updated continuously by management and MIS staff.  Only the first two-year&#13;
plan/timetable should be included in the Implementation Volume for reference, and to set&#13;
the format. Print-outs should then be produced at regular intervals, say once or twice a&#13;
year, for information and use by other project staff. For six-monthly progress reports to&#13;
be submitted to IDA, a year's time-slice should be produced and included in the report,&#13;
showing the plan/timetable for the previous six months and following six months.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall purpose of the Population
            and Family Health Project is to support the strengthening
            and revitalization of the family health and family planning
            sector, thereby improving the health status of the
            population and bringing a further reduction in fertility and
            population growth. The project will operate at two levels,
            the first national and the second in a selected group of15
            provinces. The project's objectives are: a) to increase
            utilization of family planning and related family health
            services; b) to improve the quality and range of family
            planning and related family health services; c) to enhance
            the National Committee for Population and Family
            Planning's (NCPFP) management, planning and policy
            formulation capabilities; and d) to expand the knowledge
            base on which policy and technical guidelines would be
            founded. For the selected 15 provinces, the focus will be on
            strengthening of the Primary Health Care (PHC) system at
            commune and district levels, with a particular emphasis on
            Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and family planning
            services. The project consists of five components, of which
            four are national in scope and focused on family planning
            and the fifth covers the primary health care system (commune
            and district-level). These components consist of: service
            delivery; information, education and communication;
            contraceptive supplies, family planning management and
            institutional development; and service delivery model initiative.
