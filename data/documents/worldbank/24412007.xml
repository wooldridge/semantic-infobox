                                    In the past decade, Latin America and the Caribbean&#13;
                                    has achieved impressive social and economic&#13;
                                    successes. For the first time in history, more people&#13;
                                    are in the middle class than in poverty. Inequality,&#13;
                                    although still high, declined markedly. Growth, jobs&#13;
                                    and effective social programs have transformed the&#13;
                                    lives of millions. In a striking departure from the&#13;
                                    crisis-prone Latin America of the past, the region has&#13;
                                    shown it is better prepared to weather the brunt of&#13;
                                    the global economic slowdown.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Now, the region faces the challenge of maintaining&#13;
                                     and expanding its hard won gains in an adverse&#13;
                                     context of low growth. This is caused in part by&#13;
a decrease in commodity prices and reduced economic activity in major commercial&#13;
partners such as China. In such a scenario, achieving development results â&#128;&#147; and learning&#13;
from them â&#128;&#147; becomes more important.&#13;
&#13;
This publication showcases stories about people and how their lives have been improved&#13;
through better health and education, youth employment, disaster recovery and&#13;
preparedness, infrastructure, and more.&#13;
&amp;#12;People like Zenaida, a mother of five girls, whose outlook and prospects were greatly&#13;
expanded by access to education under Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Oportunidades Program (now Prospera).&#13;
This conditional cash transfer program supported by the World Bank made it possible for&#13;
all of the sisters to study: the youngest is starting secondary school and the older four girls&#13;
have already moved onto university. Development experience and knowledge generated&#13;
by Oportunidades/Prospera now benefits numerous countries.&#13;
&#13;
This publication has concrete examples of how countries are working with the World&#13;
Bank to secure and multiply Latin America and the Caribbeanâ&#128;&#153;s achievements towards&#13;
ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.&#13;
&#13;
This year, in October, the region will be center stage of the global development debate&#13;
at the Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund,&#13;
in Lima, Peru. The results and issues highlighted in this publication will be an added&#13;
resource to the regional and global â&#128;&#156;Road to Limaâ&#128;&#157; development discussions in the lead&#13;
up to the Meetings.&#13;

PREPARING FOR THE FLU&#13;
STRENGTHENING THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SYSTEM AND CONTROLLING THE A/H1N1 EPIDEMIC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To improve its ability to control the A/H1N1 influenza epidemic, Argentina&#13;
strengthened its epidemiological response and upgraded the health surveillance&#13;
systems and network of hospitals. By December 2013, the health systems had&#13;
the ability to collect and analyze health-related information and prioritize health&#13;
problems. The systems also increased public influenza awareness, vaccinated the&#13;
most at risk population, and carried out 65,000 influenza diagnostic laboratory&#13;
tests.&#13;

&amp;#12;MOVING FORWARD&#13;
The sustainability and institutionalization of&#13;
the health situation rooms in the provinces will&#13;
depend on their continued use and transformation&#13;
into strategic tools for the management of health&#13;
decisions. The inclusion of the A/H1N1 vaccine&#13;
for high-risk groups and pneumococcal vaccine&#13;
for children into the National Vaccine Calendar&#13;
schedule is expected to reduce the likelihood of&#13;
a new A/H1N1 influenza epidemic and reduce&#13;
pneumococcus in children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BENEFICIARIES&#13;
Before the A/H1N1 epidemic, the City of Santa&#13;
Feâ&#128;&#153;s health situation room had not developed the&#13;
capacity to integrate and provide information&#13;
to support a health management strategy. With&#13;
project support, the situation room began the&#13;
systematic analysis of health-related information.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
PARTNERS&#13;
The Bank team carried out the assessment in&#13;
intense consultation with Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s Federal and&#13;
subnational governments and other development&#13;
partners, including the Inter-American&#13;
Development Bank, and seasoned experts in fiscal&#13;
federalism. This successful experience also led to&#13;
improved cooperation with CONFAZ/GEFIN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MOVING FORWARD&#13;
The final report is serving as an input for the fiscal&#13;
and debt analysis of upcoming development policy&#13;
loans (DPLs), because the proposed changes might&#13;
represent a fiscal risk to the states or, in certain&#13;
cases, a stable revenue gain. For the cases in which&#13;
there will be losses, the Bank can help the client&#13;
mitigate the losses with revenue enhancing and&#13;
expenditure efficiency measures.&#13;

Paper, and a Bicycle-inclusive Planning Operational Manual have been developed&#13;
as a resource for municipalities and national governments around the world.&#13;

The DÃ©ismÃ© family of 13, like the majority of&#13;
families in rural Haiti, used to practice open&#13;
defecation. Through a communication campaign&#13;
provided by the Kore Fanmi agent, James Noel,&#13;
and other agents, to nearly 3,000 families, the&#13;
DÃ©ismÃ© family realized the importance of using&#13;
a latrine. They were one of nearly 400 families&#13;
that decided to use their own resources and labor&#13;
to build a latrine. The family now uses the toilet&#13;
and keeps clean. Madame DÃ©ismÃ© said, â&#128;&#156;I give&#13;
more importance because my bathroom is my&#13;
own and I realized it.â&#128;&#157; The Kore Fanmi agent said&#13;
that the DÃ©ismÃ© family sensitized other families&#13;

without co-pays for its affiliates. It was established by the government of Mexico in&#13;
an effort to expand health care to those without health insurance and reduce health&#13;
inequities. Since 2004, Seguro Popular has gradually expanded to include 55.6&#13;
million people. During the projectâ&#128;&#153;s life between 2009 and 2013, 24 million people&#13;

the SEP, located in marginalized, rural, or indigenous communities that receive&#13;
compensatory programs from CONAFE. Community and compensatory schools&#13;
received dedicated support and the results in standardized national test (ENLACE)&#13;

Uruguay modernized its water utility and sanitation services to ensure that even&#13;
more Uruguayans receive accountable, costumer oriented, and better service for&#13;
their money. The project benefited around 3.05 million people, and the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s long-term partnership with the National Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;

the amount of non-revenue water (defined as water that is produced but lost before&#13;
reaching the client).&#13;

            Results in the Latin America and Caribbean Region
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In the past decade, Latin America and
            the Caribbean has achieved impressive social and economic
            successes. For the first time in history, more people are in
            the middle class than in poverty. Inequality, although still
            high, declined markedly. Growth, jobs and effective social
            programs have transformed the lives of millions. In a
            striking departure from the crisis-prone Latin America of
            the past, the region has shown it is better prepared to
            weather the brunt of the global economic slowdown. Now, the
            region faces the challenge of maintaining and expanding its
            hard won gains in an adverse context of low growth. This is
            caused in part by a decrease in commodity prices and reduced
            economic activity in major commercial partners such as
            China. In such a scenario, achieving development results -
            and learning from them - becomes more important. This
            publication showcases stories about people and how their
            lives have been improved through better health and
            education, youth employment, disaster recovery and
            preparedness, infrastructure, and more.
